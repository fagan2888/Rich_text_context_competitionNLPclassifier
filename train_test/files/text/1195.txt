Demographic Differences and Trends of Vitamin D
Insufficiency in the US Population, 1988-2004
Adit A. Ginde, MD, MPH; Mark C. Liu, MD; Carlos A. Camargo Jr, MD, DrPH
Background: Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with
suboptimal health. The prevalence of vitamin D insuffi-
ciency may be rising, but population-based trends are un-
certain. We sought to evaluate US population trends in
vitamin D insufficiency.
Methods: We compared serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25[OH]D) levels from the Third National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES III), collected dur-
ing 1988 through 1994, with NHANES data collected from
2001 through 2004 (NHANES 2001-2004). Complete data
were available for 18 883 participants in NHANES III and
13 369 participants in NHANES 2001-2004.
Results: The mean serum 25(OH)D level was 30 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 29-30) ng/mL during NHANES
III and decreased to 24 (23-25) ng/mL during NHANES
2001-2004. Accordingly, the prevalence of 25(OH)D lev-
els of less than 10 ng/mL increased from 2% (95% CI, 2%-
2%) to 6% (5%-8%), and 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL or
more decreased from 45% (43%-47%) to 23% (20%-
26%). The prevalence of 25(OH)D levels of less than 10
ng/mL in non-Hispanic blacks rose from 9% during
NHANES III to 29% during NHANES 2001-2004, with a
corresponding decrease in the prevalence of levels of 30
ng/mL or more from 12% to 3%. Differences by age strata
(mean serum 25[OH]D levels ranging from 28-32 ng/
mL) and sex (28 ng/mL for women and 32 ng/mL for men)
during NHANES III equalized during NHANES 2001-
2004 (24 vs 24 ng/mL for age and 24 vs 24 ng/mL for sex).
Conclusions: National data demonstrate a marked de-
crease in serum 25(OH)D levels from the 1988-1994 to
the2001-2004NHANESdatacollections.Racial/ethnicdif-
ferences have persisted and may have important implica-
tions for known health disparities. Current recommen-
dations for vitamin D supplementation are inadequate to
address the growing epidemic of vitamin D insufficiency.

IN THE PAST, MANY HEALTH CARE
professionalsbelievedthatthema-
jor health problems resulting from
vitamin D deficiency were rickets
in children1 and osteomalacia in
adults,2 which were greatly reduced by the
fortification of foods with vitamin D. Re-
cently,there has beenintense interestinthe
role of vitamin D in a variety of nonskel-
etal medical conditions. Indeed, vitamin D
insufficiency has been associated with in-
creases in cardiovascular disease,3-5 can-
cer,6-9 and infection.10-13 Vitamin D supple-
mentationappearstomitigatetheincidence
and adverse outcomes of these diseases and
may reduce all-cause mortality.14-17
TheInstituteofMedicinecurrentlyrec-
ommends vitamin D supplementation of
200 IU/d from birth to 50 years of age, 400
IU/d for adults aged 51 to 70 years, and
600 IU/d for adults 71 years or older.18
However, these recommendations ap-
pear limited by the goals of treatment,
which focus primarily on bone health. Un-
til recently, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25[OH]D) levels of 20 ng/mL or more (to
convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply
by 2.496) appeared adequate based on im-
proved skeletal outcomes, but increasing
evidence suggests that 30 ng/mL or even
40 ng/mL may be required for optimum
health.19-25 Indeed, several authors argue
that current recommended doses of vita-
min D supplementation are woefully in-
adequate to meet higher serum 25(OH)D
levels on a population level.22,26-28
Sunlight exposure is the primary deter-
minant of vitamin D status in humans and,
particularly in northern latitudes from No-
vember to March, there are insufficient
UV-B rays to produce vitamin D.29 Success-
ful campaigns to control sun exposure
through avoidance and sun protection,
coupled with decreases in outdoor physi-
cal activity, may have increased the preva-
lence of vitamin D insufficiency.29,30 In ad-
dition, because many studies of vitamin D
have focused on particular subgroups (ie,
older adults, women, and racial sub-
groups),theThirdNationalHealthandNu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
has served as the primary source of popu-

United States.31,32 Because these data were collected from
1988 to 1994, changes in prevalence of vitamin D insuf-
ficiency during the past decade could affect national rec-
ommendations about vitamin D status.

METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS
Every year, the National Center for Health Statistics conducts the
NHANES, a nationally representative probability sample of the
noninstitutionalized US civilian population. Initially, NHANES
data were released in large blocks of 6 to 7 years; the most recent
of these releases was NHANES III, collected from 1988 to 1994.
Starting in January 1999, NHANES data were released in 2-year
cycles. We received a waiver from our institutional review board
to analyze NHANES III and the 2 most recent cycles of released
NHANES data (ie, data collected from January 2001 through De-
cember 2004, hereinafter referred to as NHANES 2001-2004).
Details of survey methods are described elsewhere.33 Briefly,
the sample is obtained by using a complex, stratified, multi-
stage probability study design with unequal probabilities of se-
lection.CertainsubgroupsofpeopleareoversampledinNHANES,
including low-income persons, adolescents aged 12 to 17 years,
adults 60 years or older, African Americans, and Mexican Ameri-
cans. The NHANES sampling strategy uses 4 stages covering geo-
graphic primary sampling units, which are counties or small
groups of contiguous counties, segments within primary sam-
pling units (a block or group of blocks), households within seg-
ments, and 1 or more participants within households.
From 1988 to 1994, NHANES III collected household inter-
viewdata,includingdemographiccharacteristicsanddataonhealth
and nutrition for 22 266 of 27 145 invited participants aged 12 or
older (82%). Of these, most (19 784 [89%]) subsequently re-
ceived physical and laboratory examinations in a mobile exami-
nation center or at a home visit. We limited our analysis to these
18 883 participants with reported serum 25(OH)D values (901
missing), who represented 195 million Americans. During 2001
to 2004, NHANES collected household interview data for 15 242
of 19 275 invited participants 12 years or older (79%). Subse-
quently, 14 435 of these (95%) received physical and laboratory
examinations in a mobile examination center, and 13 369 par-
ticipants(88%)underwentmeasurementofserum25(OH)Dlev-
els (1066 missing), which represented 221 million Americans.
Strategies for sampling and methods of data collection were
very similar to maintain consistency and facilitate compari-
sons throughout the NHANES years. In particular, because
physical and laboratory examinations occurred in mobile ex-
amination centers, inclement weather was an issue during data
collection. To avoid these issues and improve response, the
NHANES mobile examination centers preferentially sched-
uled data collection in the lower latitudes (further south) dur-
ing the winter months and in higher latitudes (further north)
during the summer months, a strategy that was used consis-
tently in all years of NHANES data collection.
DATA COLLECTION
Blood samples for serum 25(OH)D testing collected during the
examination were centrifuged, divided into aliquots, and frozen
to -70°C on site and then shipped on dry ice to central labora-
tories, where they were stored at -70°C until analysis. Serum 25
(OH)D levels were measured by a radioimmunoassay kit after ex-
traction with acetonitrile (DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minnesota) by the
National Center for Environmental Health (Atlanta, Georgia). Be-
cause risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency have been exten-
sively explored in previous NHANES analyses,30 we focused the
current analysis on self-reported age, sex, and race/ethnicity col-
lected during the household interview to evaluate changes in pre-
viously documented demographic disparities in vitamin D insuf-
ficiency.31,32 Becausethemonthofdatacollectionwasnotpublicly
reported in NHANES 2001-2004 (owing to protection of confi-
dentiality), we did not record or control for season.
ANALYSIS
We performed statistical analyses using commercially available
software (Stata, version 9.0; StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
Using survey commands, we applied the recommended sub-
sample weights for the interview plus examination data to ac-
count for unequal probabilities of selection and to represent ac-
curate estimates for the US population. All results are presented
as weighted values. We calculated variance on the basis of
NHANES-provided masked variance units, using the Taylor se-
ries linearization method. We categorized serum 25(OH)D lev-
elsaslessthan10ng/mLand30ng/mLormore.22,26 Primaryanaly-
sis is descriptive, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical
comparisons used difference of means or proportions of 25
(OH)D levels with 95% CIs to facilitate interpretation of clini-
cally and statistically significant differences.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays major demographic characteristics and
serum25(OH)DlevelsfromtheNHANESIIIandNHANES
2001-2004 samples. Overall, the mean serum 25(OH)D
level in the US population was 30 (95% CI, 29-30) ng/mL
during the 1988-1994 collection and deceased to 24 (23-
25) ng/mL during the 2001-2004 collection.
Figure 1 illustrates the changes in mean serum 25
(OH)D levels from NHANES III to NHANES 2001-2004.
Differencesinmeanserum25(OH)Dlevelsbyagethatwere
present in 1988 to 1994 nearly equalized by 2001 to 2004.
Specifically, mean levels in NHANES III ranged from 28
ng/mL for subjects 60 years or older to 32 ng/mL for those
aged 12 to 19 years (difference, 4 [95% CI, 3-6] ng/mL).
However, by NHANES 2001-2004, these mean levels were
similar, ranging from 24 ng/mL for subjects 60 years or
older to 24 ng/mL for those aged 12 to 19 years (differ-
ence, 1 [95% CI, 0-2] ng/mL). Likewise, the lower mean
serum 25(OH)D level for females in NHANES III (32 vs
28 ng/mL for males and females, respectively; difference,
4 [95% CI, 3-4] ng/mL) equalized in NHANES 2001-
2004 (24 vs 24 ng/mL, respectively; difference, 0 [95% CI,
0-1] ng/mL). By contrast, vitamin D­level differences by
race/ethnicity (ie, the lower mean serum 25[OH]D levels
in non-Hispanic blacks and to a lesser extent Mexican-
Americansandthoseofotherrace/ethnicity,comparedwith
non-Hispanic whites) have persisted over time (Figure 1).
Figure 2 demonstrates the increasing prevalence of
serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 10 ng/mL in the US

groups had increases in 25(OH)D levels of less than 10
ng/mL, existing disparities by older age essentially disap-
peared, whereas those by female sex and nonwhite race/
ethnicity persisted. Notably, the prevalence of 25(OH)D
levels of less than 10 ng/mL in non-Hispanic blacks rose
from 9% in NHANES III to 29% in NHANES 2001-2004
(difference, 20% [95% CI, 16%-24%]).
Figure 3 illustrates the marked decrease in serum 25
(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL or more. Overall, the preva-
lence of 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL or more decreased
by approximately half from 45% in NHANES III to 23%
in NHANES 2001-2004 (difference, 22% [95% CI, 19%-
26%]). Disparities by age and sex leveled, as illustrated in
Figure 3, but again, the disparities by race/ethnicity per-
sisted. Of particular note, the prevalence of 25(OH)D lev-
els of 30 ng/mL or more among non-Hispanic blacks de-
creased, from 12% in NHANES III to 3% in NHANES
2001-2004 (difference, 9% [95% CI, 7%-11%]).
A detailed stratification of serum 25(OH)D levels by
demographiccharacteristicsispresentedinTable 2 (strati-
fication by alternate 25[OH]D thresholds is available on
request from the authors). There was a trend toward lower
serum 25(OH)D levels with increasing age for non-
Hispanic whites and Mexican-Americans. This trend ap-
peared stronger in NHANES III compared with NHANES
2001-2004. Non-Hispanic blacks did not have this in-
verse association between age and serum 25(OH)D lev-
els. In addition, serum 25(OH)D levels were lowest for
those aged 20 to 39 years among non-Hispanic blacks.
COMMENT
To our knowledge, we report the first evaluation of tem-
poral trends in vitamin D status in the US population.
The NHANES data demonstrate a marked decrease in
mean serum 25(OH)D levels from the 1988-1994 to the
2001-2004 collections and a corresponding increase in
vitamin D insufficiency across all demographic strata.
These findings have important implications for health dis-
parities and public health.
During 2001 to 2004, only 23% of US adolescents and
adults had serum 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL or more,
theminimumlevelthatappearsnecessaryforgeneralhealth
benefits.22,26 Inparticular,thesehigher25(OH)Dlevelshave
been associated with reduced incidence and improved out-
comes in cardiovascular disease,3-5 cancer,6-9 and infec-
tion.10-13 Furthermore, supplementation appears to miti-
gate the risk associated with vitamin D insufficiency.14-17
The current analysis describes a much higher preva-
lence (77% during NHANES 2001-2004) of vitamin D
insufficiency in the US population than previously re-
ported.31,32 Changes in population demographics were lim-
ited and do not appear to explain the observed increase
in prevalence. In addition, NHANES preferentially avoided
sampling in northern latitudes during the winter; thus,
the true prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in the US
population is likely even higher than we have reported.

ments). Few foods contain vitamin D2
(ergocalciferol) or
vitamin D3
(cholecalciferol),26 and recommended doses
of vitamin D supplementation have not changed signifi-
cantlyinthepast2decades.18 Therefore,ingestionis,atmost,
a small component of the marked change in prevalence.
Because exposure to UV-B rays is the primary determi-
nant of vitamin D status in humans, this is more likely the
primary cause of the increasing prevalence of vitamin D
insufficiency.29 Although widespread campaigns for sun-
screen use and sun avoidance, including Healthy People
2010, have reduced the incidence of skin cancers,34 sun-
screen with a sun protection factor of 15 also decreases the
synthesis of vitamin D3
by 99%.35 Increased sunscreen use
with a higher sun protection factor likely contributed to
the reported trend of lower 25(OH)D levels. In addition,
decreased outdoor activity and obesity have been associ-
ated with vitamin D insufficiency.30,36 The increased inac-
tivity and obesity in the US population has likely contrib-
uted to the observed rise in vitamin D insufficiency.37
Previously published data suggested that vitamin D
insufficiency was more prevalent among older adults (ow-
ing to reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol levels in skin),
women (owing to lower outdoor activity), and individu-
als with darker skin (owing to increased melanin).26,30,32
We found that previous differences by age and sex have
equalized, but those by race/ethnicity have remained. The
loss of age- and sex-related differences may be second-
ary to disproportionately greater time indoors (eg, with
television, computers, and video games) and less time out-
doors among younger compared with older individuals
and males compared with females.
Although socioeconomic status, health care access, life-
style, and cultural factors contribute to racial/ethnic dis-
parities in disease incidence and outcomes,38 vitamin D in-
sufficiency may provide a plausible biological explanation
for health differences. In particular, black and, to a lesser
extent, Hispanic Americans have a markedly higher preva-
lence of vitamin D insufficiency and higher incidence and
worse outcomes for cardiovascular disease, certain can-
cers, diabetes mellitus, and renal disease, all of which have
been linked to vitamin D insufficiency.22,26,38 Indeed, Wolf
et al39 recently reported that, compared with white pa-
tientsundergoingdialysis,mortalitywas16%lowerinblack
patients receiving vitamin D supplements but 35% higher
in black patients not receiving supplements. Randomized
trials of vitamin D supplementation in diverse cohorts of
patients will help to further evaluate this hypothesis.
As recently suggested,22,26-28 our data provide addi-
tional evidence that current recommendations18 for vita-
min D supplementation (200-600 IU/d) are inadequate to
achieve optimal serum 25(OH)D levels in most of the US
population. These recommendations were based on older
prevalence data, which had a lower prevalence of subop-
timal serum 25(OH)D levels, and were focused on skel-
etal outcomes, which target lower overall levels than are
required for optimal general health.19-25 For instance, 400
or 800 IU/d would raise serum 25(OH)D levels by only
approximately 4 or 9 ng/mL, respectively,40 which would

be inadequate for many Americans based on the present
analysis.Furthermore,currentrecommendationsarestrati-
fied by age; however, our data suggest that current serum
25(OH)D levels are similar across the age spectrum.
Recommendations based on race/ethnicity (ie, higher
levels of supplementation for blacks) would be more con-
sistent with current population-based data. In addition,
although not specifically evaluated in this analysis, rec-
ommendations by season and latitude (ie, higher supple-
mentation in the winter and at higher latitudes) would
likely be more effective.
This study has some potential limitations. First, meth-
odologic explanations for the increased prevalence of vi-
tamin D insufficiency should be considered. However, data
were collected by the same group (the National Center for
Health Statistics) using similar methods, a similar sam-
plingtechnique,andthesame25(OH)Dassay,whichmake
this unlikely. In addition, nonresponse bias could have
someeffectontheresults,althoughthesurveyweightspro-
vided by the National Center for Health Statistics attempt
to control for this. We have based our serum 25(OH)D
thresholdsonpreviousoutcomestudies;nooutcomeswere
assessedinthisanalysis.Serumwascollectedatonly1point
and preferentially collected in northern states in the sum-
mer and southern states in the winter. As a result, the data
presented most likely represent the best-case scenario; ran-
domsamplingacrossallseasonsshouldyieldanevenhigher
prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency. Additional poten-
tial limitations are that the demographic information was
self-reported and that other factors associated with vita-
min D insufficiency were not analyzed (eg, season, lati-
tude, estimated sunlight exposure, and diet). However, be-
cause determinants of vitamin D insufficiency have been
well described, the purpose of our analysis was to exam-
ine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in the US
population.
CONCLUSIONS
We found that the mean serum 25(OH)D level in the US
population dropped by 6 ng/mL from the 1988-1994 to
the 2001-2004 data collections. This drop was associ-
ated with an overall increase in vitamin D insufficiency

to nearly 3 of every 4 adolescent and adult Americans.
Although differences by age and sex have equalized, racial/
ethnic differences have persisted and may help to ex-
plain known racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular
disease, cancer, and other major health conditions. Nearly
all non-Hispanic blacks (97%) and most Mexican-
Americans (90%) now have vitamin D insufficiency.
Current recommendations for dosage of vitamin D
supplements are inadequate to address this growing epi-
demic of vitamin D insufficiency. Increased intake of vi-
tamin D (1000 IU/d)--particularly during the winter
months and at higher latitudes--and judicious sun ex-
posure would improve vitamin D status and likely im-
prove the overall health of the US population. Large ran-
domized controlled trials of these higher doses of vitamin
D supplementation are needed to evaluate their effect on
general health and mortality.
