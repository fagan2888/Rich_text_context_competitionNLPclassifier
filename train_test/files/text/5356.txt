The Ural range is undoubtedly in one of those enigmatic regions
where the landscape has a direct effect on minds.

Introduction: Why the Urals Matter?
In recent decades, there has been an increasing interest in the
study of cultural landscapes in connection with regional and
cultural identity. Geographers view places not only as envi-
ronmental spaces but also as subjective "processes," that are
humanly produced and humanly changeable, thus represent-
ing the evolution and condensation of a complex history of
environmental, economic, political, and social processes
(Agnew, 2001; Entrikin, 1996; MacLeod, 1998; Murphy,
1991; Paasi, 2002). There is a reciprocal relationship between
the identities of places and of people inhabiting these places.
"Representative landscapes" constitute visual encapsulation
of a shared past, with such major cultural identifiers as
nationality, language, religion, and ethnicity (Norton, 2000).
The dynamics of cultural identity are crystallized through
region-building institutions, and how these places are repro-
duced is often regulated by a state or regional government
(Frers & Meier, 2007). These intricate processes are embed-
ded in material culture "from above," in the form of region-
building institutions such as economy or governance (Paasi,
2004) and are preserved in visual culture "from below" in the
collective memory of people through folklore, mass media,
films, and artistic narratives (Paasi, 2003).
Russia, with its vast size, uneven population distribution,
and relatively low population mobility, is extremely hetero-
geneous. Although Russia has always been a center-periph-
ery structured country, the fragmentation of the periphery
intensified in the last two decades since the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991. Although each Russian region is a
product of long economic, social, and political development,
many regions were formed on a rather artificial basis, which
was especially typical for the Soviet period (1917-1991),
when the major ideological basis for the region delimitation
was the premise of their objective existence (Givental, 2009).
The Urals region, however, has been uniquely different in its
intrinsic vastly recognizable features that lie deeply within
its natural resource base and its deep ties with the history of
the entire Russia spanning over 300 years and cutting across
the variety of economic and political regimes.
The Ural Mountains in Russia stretch north-to-south for
over 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) from the Arctic Ocean to
the Kazakhstan border. The medieval name for the moun-
tains was the "Stone Belt" or simply the "Stone" (Kamen in
Russian), reflecting the stone beauty and the harshness of the
region (Figure 1). Russia emerged as Russ Land west of the

Three Hundred Years of Glory and
Gloom: The Urals Region of Russia in Art
and Reality
Elena Givental1
Abstract
The Ural Mountains in Russia are recognized for their picturesque scenery, exceptional mineral wealth, and geopolitical
significance in Russian history. The Urals are also notoriously known as a site of the Soviet military industrial complex, the
birthplace of the Soviet nuclear program, and the most polluted region in Russia. The evolving Urals' imagery as Russia's
"treasure box" and "Russia's defender" has been a continual theme through the region's identity and economic progression
over the period of 300 years. At different times and by different powers, the Urals was glorified or ostracized, however,
preserving its iconic image. The article explores the origins of the Ural's identity and the evolution of the Urals' diverse
meanings using the evidence from published scholarly sources and works of art.

Urals in the end of the 10th century and continued expanding
eastward to "Asian" Russia, across the Urals until the late
18th century. According to the Russian Census (2002),
65.6% of Russia's population lives to the west of the Urals
where the climate is moderate and agriculture is feasible.
This includes the old industrial centers of Central and
Southern Russia, which form the established European core.
The densely populated and resource-rich central and south-
ern parts of the Ural Mountains are combined in one of
Russia's eleven economic regions, with its present
boundaries unchanged since the last regionalization update
in the early 1980s (Figure 2). This region, although just 5%
of the country's territory, is the home to almost 20 million
people or 13.7% of the total Russian population (Russian
Census, 2002).
Since the times of Tsar Peter the Great, when Russia
evolved as a novel metal-producing center in the early 18th
century and gained its dominance on the Baltic Sea, and
through the years of WWII (1941-1945) and the consequent
reconstruction, the Urals region has been perceived in
Russia as the country's mineral treasury and its military
stronghold. In Russia's industrialization efforts, from the
17th century through the Soviet era (1917-1991), the ruling
powers maintained the stronghold image of the Urals.
Outside Russia, however, the Urals is notoriously known as
the heart of the Soviet nuclear industry and an area of
extreme environmental degradation. A 2008 online book on
comparative regional geography paid sufficient attention to
the region contrasting the Russian Urals with the American
Appalachia (Braden, 2008). The authors, a team ofAmerican
and Russian geographers, described the Urals as "these
gloomy mountains," "a region out of sync with time and sur-
rounding space," and "a forgotten place . . . populated by
people not wanted elsewhere" (Rogachev & Brunn, 2008,
p. 21). In a few strokes, the authors created a visual image of
a depressing, polluted Urals, with its centuries-long dark
industrial past and equally dark and hopeless present. "The
Soviet galvanization of the nearly stiffened corpse of the
antiquated industrial region has considerably worsened the
unattractive features of the Urals" (Rogachev & Brunn,
2008, p. 19) stated the authors with a certainty that could

forever discourage anyone willing to learn more about the
Urals region from plunging into the quest. This contradic-
tory character of the Urals region has produced an array of
contested images, both inside and outside Russia. The eco-
nomic history of Russia over the last 300 years has been
closely intertwined with the development of the Urals
Region, and reducing the region's image to a polluted, out-
dated, and largely forgotten smudge on the face of the Earth
is factually incorrect and unfair to the Uralian people.
Method
The cultural landscape is a material record of human activ-
ity, and as such we can gather information on the landscape
creation and meaning through both visual sources, such as
direct and indirect observations, and historical records. As
"raw appearances" can be deceptive, it is necessary to move
beyond the mere reliance on empirical observations and
unearth the repositories of human meaning and interpreta-
tion that underpin lived realities. Approaching the land-
scape as a palimpsest, a manuscript that has been written,
scraped, and rewritten many times allows us to analyze a
contemporary landscape as an accumulated human occu-
pance in a particular location (Givental, 2011; Rhoads &
Wilson, 2010; Schein, 2010).
This article explores the roots of the long-lasting unique-
ness of the Urals region through the historic records and the
Urals' imagery. While the former contribute to analyzing the
forces that propelled that distinctiveness from "above," the
latter helps to recognize the role of written and visual art as a
living testimony to the evolution of the Urals' identity in the
contemporary Russian psyche. Although not the native of the
Urals, the author gained a deep familiarity with the region
during the years of geological fieldwork spanning the period
between 1985 and 1995, the years of the dramatic political
and economic upheaval and changes. While the method of
direct observations is quite reliable for cross-sectional stud-
ies, the goal of this research is to show the longitudinal
dimension of the formation of the Urals cultural identity in
the minds of the Russian people. This task is accomplished
by combining the historical records with the artistic narra-
tives, both written and visual, that may serve as a proof of the
long-lasting imagery which differentiates the Urals region
from any other region in the vast Russian domain. As the
longitudinal study spans the period over 300 years, the narra-
tive has to move from the prerevolutionary Russia (before
the Socialist Revolution of 1917) to the Soviet period (1917-
1991) characterized by the command economy and the tragic
loss of millions of lives due to the Civil War of 1918-1921,
the political purges of the Stalin regime (1937-1953), and the
WWII on the Soviet territory (1941-1945). The narrative
then moves to the post-Soviet Russia, which emerged after
the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The Mountain Range As a "Treasure
Box"
The rich variety of mineral resources is the most characteris-
tic feature of the Urals region and was the root for its indus-
trial development during the last 300 years. The Russians
often proudly cite that more than 1,000 minerals and more
than 12,000 mineral deposits have been discovered in the
Urals, including 48 out of the most important 55 chemical
elements used in human economic activity (Vinokurov,
Glushkova, Makar, Plisetskaya, & Simagina, 2004). While
the western slope of the mountain range is rich in nonmetal-
lic deposits (oil, natural gas, and mineral salts) the eastern
slope bears a remarkable variety of valuable metallic ores,
especially iron, copper, chromium, vanadium, gold, plati-
num, and a variety of precious stones. This distinctive geo-
graphical dichotomy of the Urals' mineral resources has
determined the location of chemical industries in the western
Urals and metallurgy in the eastern Urals.
Iron and copper ore deposits were discovered in the Urals
at the beginning of the 17th century and became the basis for
the region's emergence as one of the first heavy industry
regions in Europe. Gold was discovered in the Urals in the
early 18th century, triggering a Gold Rush. A 36-kilogram
(80 pound) gold nugget from the Urals is still exhibited in the
Russian Diamond Fund in Moscow's Kremlin. The Central
Urals region also became famous in the 18th and 19th centu-
ries for its unique stocks of malachite, associated with cop-
per ore deposits. The solid blocks of malachite from this area
were extensively used for decorating the Versailles Palace in
France as well as the winter and summer palaces of the
Russian tsars in St. Petersburg.
Although the Urals economic region combines the eastern
and western parts of the mountain range, it is mainly the
areas of the eastern slope of the Urals (Sverdlovsk and
Chelyabinsk regions, Figure 3) with metallic ores and pre-
cious stones that have been traditionally recognized as "the
treasure box" of Russia. The world famous Russian Court
jeweler of French origin, Carl Fabergé (1846-1920), acquired
most of his gems and hard stones (emerald, ruby, topaz, alex-
andrite, jasper, and malachite among others) in the Central
Urals where he established his own lapidary factory.
Fabergé's works, made of the Urals' gemstones, are still on
display in the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, the
Forbes Galleries, and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York.
The mode of life in the Urals, as well as the artistic inspi-
rations of the Urals' writers, has long focused on mining
activities.
Just as the inhabitant of Central Russia goes out "to nature" to
pick berries and mushrooms, so the Uralian drives his old jalopy
out looking for gems; to him, a place without deposits and veins
makes no sense . . . It's the rare family whose attic isn't strewn
4 SAGE Open
with fused cobbles and malachite scales covered with black
oxides, quartz druses that look like the city's spring ice, and
polished chips of all the common gemstones. (Slavnikova,
2007a, p. 79)
Writers were not only inspired the abundance of the Urals'
gemstones. The Urals-born Russian novelist and essayist,
Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak (1852-1912), who lived and worked
in the Urals during the serfdom-abolition reform years,
became famous for his social novels that described life in the
mining and industrial Urals with its unsaturated drive for
profits, distorted morals and legal norms. Olga Slavnikova, a
Uralian writer of the new post-Soviet generation, describes a
prospering illegal business of precious stone collection in her
novel "2017" (Slavnikova, 2007b). However, even depicting
the dark sides of the region's reality, local authors have
always preserved their deep appreciation of the Urals'beauty
and deep-lying treasures.
The Ural Mountains, weathered and blanketed in a haze that
passes through hundreds of gradations of gray, look like
decorative park ruins. There's nothing left for a painter to do
amid this ready-made lithic beauty. Every landscape, no matter
where you look, already has its composition and basic colors, a
characteristic correlation of parts that combine into a simple and
recognizable Urals logo. (Slavnikova, 2007a, p. 76)
Russian writer Pavel Bazhov (1879-1950), also a native
of the Urals, created the most poetic and identifiable set of
Urals stories based on miners' folk tales told to him by an
old-time Urals prospector. These stories blend the reality of
the miners' and stone-cutters' hard labor in the 19th century

with mythological narratives about the mysterious Mistress
of the Copper Mountain and her attendant lizards, and Poloz
the Great Snake, guarding the mineral treasures (Bazhov,
1987). Bazhov's first collection of stories, "The Malachite
Casket" was published in the Soviet Union in 1939 and
translated into English in the 1940s. The central tale of the
collection, "The Stone Flower," is a romantic love story
staged in the Uralian village of the 19th century. A gifted vil-
lage stone-cutter Danila is enchanted by the Mistress of the
Copper Mountain who guards the secret of creative beauty;
he is obsessed with the idea of cutting a malachite flower
which would be more beautiful than a real one.
The mountain goddess guided him through caverns, each one
more beautiful than the last. Their walls shone with outcroppings
of gems, and more jewels covered the ground. One cavern had a
ceiling so low that Danila could hardly stand upright--the
amethyst walls were lit from by an unseen light source and he
felt as if he and the Mistress of Copper Mountain were held for
a moment in the jewel's heart. (Jenks, 2007)
Only the love of a simple village girl saves him from the
obsessive charms of the mountain queen. This romantic story
was turned into one of the first Russian color films in 1946.
In 1950, the famous Russian composer Sergey Prokofiev
created a ballet "The Tale of the Stone Flower" based on
Bazhov's narrative. The Urals' "treasure box" identity has
left a strong imprint in the minds of the Russian people.
The Urals As a Military Stronghold
If the Urals' "treasure box" image was created by a popular
perception of its enormous mineral treasures, its "military
stronghold" identity was promoted during the most trying
times linked to Russia's two controversial leaders: Peter the
Great (1682-1725) and Joseph Stalin (1879-1953). Tsar
Peter's imperial policy and strategic decision making
launched the first Russian industrialization "from above,"
facilitating Russia's victory in the war with Sweden in 1721
and moving Russia forward into the ranks of the most
advanced European monarchies. During Peter's reign, the
Urals, with its newly discovered mineral riches, was trans-
formed into a major metal and armament producing region,
thus eliminating Russia's dependence on the European metal
market. Between 1701 and 1725, 23 metallurgical plants,
including 13 iron works and 10 copper smelters, took-off in
the Urals. By 1750, Russia was the world's leading producer
of iron, with an annual output of 53,000 tons with the Urals'
share being 72%. Almost all Russia's copper, the main non-
ferrous metal to be smelted in the 18th century, came from
the Urals (Blackwell, 1968; Gavrilov, 2005; Parker, 1968).
The 18th century Industrial Revolution in Europe, how-
ever, tarnished the Uralian glory and the Urals' metallurgical
industry "surrendered" to Great Britain due to a failure to
adopt the latest technological innovations in steel production
(Goldman, 1956; Harris, 1999). In the 1890s, when the
Russian Finance Minister Sergei Witte (1849-1915) pro-
moted development of the new technologically advanced
and railroad-connected metallurgical base in the Donets
Basin of Ukraine (Donbas), the Urals lost the economic com-
petition to Ukraine (Goldman, 1956). Thus, the Urals entered
the 20th century as an old industrial region, with partially
exhausted mineral resource base and obsolete equipment.
The Russian industrialization during the Soviet regime,
in the 1930s under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, marked
the period of the second rise of the Urals region. Earlier, the
Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing Civil War of
1918-1921 had left Russia's economy in ruins. At the end
of the 1920s, Stalin designed a centrally planned command
economy with the goal of erasing all traces of capitalism
and transforming the Soviet Union into an industrialized
state, which would be able to effectively compete with the
capitalist world. The measures for achieving these goals
were industrialization and agricultural collectivization
"from above." During this dramatic period of rapid indus-
trialization in the Soviet Union (1927-1941), the Urals got
a second chance to become Russia's largest and most
advanced producer of metals and heavy machinery. Dozens
of existing iron plants and copper smelters were recon-
structed, and several new industrial giants were completed.
The Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Complex in the Southern
Urals, constructed in 1929-1933, became the biggest steel
plant in Europe with annual capacity of 2.5 million metric
tons of pig iron (Kotkin, 1991).
The Russians popularly believed that defense of the
Soviet territory during World War II (1941-1945) could not
have succeeded without the development of the eastern
regions beyond the enemy's reach. Between July and
November 1941, over 1,500 industrial enterprises were
physically transferred, piece by piece, from the European
part of the Soviet Union to the east. Of these enterprises,
667 factories, together with the evacuated population, were
resettled in the mining and manufacturing areas of the Urals
(Polyakov, 1966). The share of national iron ore produced in
the Urals increased from 26% in 1940 to 90% in 1942
(Figure 4). Heavy machinery plants in the Urals were
retooled to produce weapons. Literally from scratch, the
Urals workers created a gigantic tank-manufacturing base.
In 1941-1945, the three Urals tank plants, located in
Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, and Nizhniy Tagil (Figure 3),
manufactured 54,000 heavy and medium tanks and self-
propelled artillery, which comprised 70% of the total arma-
ment production in the Soviet Union (Kirillov & Popov,
2000; Shabad, 1969; Zubrilov & Dementiev, 1995).
"Pravda," the official newspaper of the Soviet Union's
leading Communist Party, wrote in its front page article on
January 3, 1943: "The Urals carried on its strong shoulders
the heaviest burden of supplying the Soviet Army with the
weapons. The people of the Urals accomplished it! They
have added a new glorious eternal page to the Urals'
6 SAGE Open
long-lived fame" (Zubrilov & Dementiev, 1995, p. 124).
Although Russians were rarely inclined to accept Soviet
mass media propaganda labels, of which the Urals as "the
foundry of the victory" was one of many, the Urals's identity
as "Russia's defender" was truly embedded in the Russian
postwar national consciousness.
The Soviet Legacy: Gloom Instead of
Glory?
By the late 1960s, the Urals heavy industry ran out of cheap
local open pit ores and developed a raw-material dependence
on the county's eastern regions: Siberia, Central Asia, and
Kazakhstan (Lydolph, 1990; ZumBrunnen & Osleeb, 1986).
David Hooson, a well-known Western scholar of the Soviet
economy, reflected on this tendency of "filling out of the
Soviet manufacturing belt toward Lake Baikal" (Siberia) in
his regional essay of the Soviet Union (1964).
At present, the crucial axis of nationally important industry in
the Soviet Union runs north from the Donbas to Moscow and
then east through Gorky, Kuybyshev, Chelyabinsk, Karaganda,
Novosibirsk, and Krasnoyarsk to Irkutsk. This is by no means
continuous enough yet to be called a "belt," but the lines are
drawn, the capital invested, and a psychology of "Go East,
young man" sedulously fostered, which has become at least as
nationally emotive as its American equivalent--quite possibly
with even more realistic justification. (Hooson, 1964, p. 46)
In addition to its economic decline, the old industrial
Urals suffered from severe environmental pollution, the
result of rapid heavy industrialization without regard to
environmental consequences. By the 1990s, the Urals held
notorious "first place" in the levels of industrial air pollu-
tion, including 50% of all mercury, 40% of chlorine, and
30% of fluorine air emissions in Russia. Many rivers in the
Urals contained the amounts of oil, ammonia, zinc, chro-
mium, phenols, and other chemicals that significantly
exceeded the permissible state limits (Gramolin & Yevseev,
1996; Pryde, 1995).
Sulfur air pollution as a result of the metallurgical techno-
logical process, which turned iron sulfide ores into pig iron
and steel, was blamed for widespread cases of respiratory
diseases and asthma among the residents of the Urals' major
industrial centers. The "giant of industrialization," the
Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Complex, was described by a
witness:
The metallurgical complex dominates city life in every way . . .
Signs of industrialization are everywhere, from the multicolored
and unbreathable air to the many young men wearing bandages
or walking with a limp . . . The roar and smoke and smell of
steelmaking can be sensed from any part of the city twenty-four
hours a day. (Kotkin, 1995, pp. 1-2)
After WWII, which ended in 1945, the Urals, maintaining
its militarization track, became the birthplace of the Russian
Soviet nuclear industry. In the 1950s, a series of nuclear acci-
dents near the city of Kyshtym in the Southern Urals resulted
in air and water radioactive contamination of a vast territory.
More than 20 million curie of radioactivity was released into
the environment. In accordance with the Soviet "traditions,"
the accidents were kept secret, and no effort was made to
inform the villagers who lived nearby. Although the total
amount of released radiation was 25 times lower than that
released by the infamous 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe in
Ukraine, the health consequences of the radioactive pollution
were still traced 30 years later, marked by elevated children
mortality, various birth defects, and lower life expectancy
(Lydolph, Johnson, Mintz, & Mills, 1978; Nakipelov &
Drozhko, 1990).
As a result of environmental degradation and the crisis in
resource based industries, the Urals experienced a large net
out-migration. In a 1-year interval (1968-1969) 110,000 peo-
ple left the Urals. Although the intensity of out-migration
decreased over the next decade, with the loss of 55,800 peo-
ple between 1979 and 1988, it still remained the highest in
the Russian Federation until the collapse of the Soviet Union
in 1991 (Koroteev, Fedorov, & Ivanov, 2006).
The Urals' post-Soviet experience is as ambivalent as the
past 300 years. The remembrance of the ruthless assassina-
tion by the Bolsheviks of the Romanov royal family in the
Uralian capital city of Yekaterinburg in 1918 blends with the
more recent memories of the largest GULAG labor camps
during the Stalin regime. The Soviet command economy
built upon the tremendous natural and human potential of the
Urals to achieve its industrialization goals, but left the region
behind in the 1970s moving resources to Siberia and Central
Asia. The Russian economic recession of the 1990s also had
a deconstructive effect on the Urals region: The problems of
Figure 4. The share of the Urals' steel production in percent

low birthrate and depopulation, alcohol abuse and high male
mortality, high unemployment rate due to the region's demil-
itarization and overall decrease in industrial production, and
general degradation of living standards--these are the signs
of the post-Soviet situation in the Urals. Regional disparities
in the Urals regions are great; however, here, more than any-
where else in Russia, one can see a direct relationship
between the "treasure box" status and the rate of capital
investment. Due to Russian government's policy of promot-
ing clusters of growth rather than investing in depressed
regions, the Urals resembles a mosaic of industrial and com-
mercial high-tech hubs alternating with the depressed and
economically underdeveloped areas (Giannias, Liargovas, &
Chepurko, 2005).
Unexpectedly, the traditional old mining areas of the
Urals' eastern slope, especially Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk
provinces (Figure 3), became the "winners" in the process of
disintegration of the Soviet Union. While the breakdown
resulted in Russia losing a significant part of its metal-pro-
ducing capacities and raw-material base in the new post-
Soviet countries of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia, it
also increased Russia's demand for metals produced in the
Urals, thus providing an incentive for the modernization of
the Urals' existing mining and manufacturing capacities
(Koroteev et al., 2006; Tatarkin, 2006). The Russian federal
program "The Ore" and the regional program "The Ore of
the Urals" have amplified the "treasure box" identity of the
Urals region by directing a large volume of federal and for-
eign investments necessary to the recovery of the Urals min-
ing activity. Under these new programs, the Urals Geological
Survey has intensified ore prospecting in the underexploited
northern parts of the Urals. The first years of the program's
implementation have clearly shown that the Urals' "treasure
box" of mineral resources is not depleted. In fact, the poten-
tial reserves of manganese, chromium, copper, and bauxite in
the Urals are estimated to comprise 25%, 37%, 33%, and
40% of the total Russia's reserves of these metals, respec-
tively (Koroteev et al., 2006; Yakovlev, Burykin, &
Stakheyev, 1999). As a result of revived mining activity in
the Urals, capital investments in industrial enterprises, based
on the utilization of mineral resources, have grown tremen-
dously since the beginning of market reforms. The invest-
ments come from American, European, and East Asian
companies, among them Philips, Lufthansa, Ford, Audi, and
Volvo. The region has become the site of an exceptional
growth of technopolises, many of them based on the former
military­industrial R&D complexes. The regional govern-
ment, together with the Boeing and Airbus corporations, has
been working on a project to create a technopolis, ambi-
tiously termed "Titanium Valley," for designing and manu-
facturing titanium modules for commercial aircrafts (Russia
to Set Up Titanium Valley, 2011). According to the project,
the Special Economic Zone Titanium Valley will attract at
least 20 industrial residents and US$1.7 billion in invest-
ment. As a federal program, incorporated in the Russian
Federation's Long-Term Plan on Economic and Social
Development, the Titanium Valley is a top-down pilot proj-
ect of a high-tech cluster (Special Economic Zone Titanium
Valley, 2012).
Conclusion: The Contested Symbolism
of the Urals
In spite of the obvious significance of the Urals in Russian
history, the Urals region has been largely overlooked in
recent scholarly narratives. The only above-mentioned refer-
ence to the Urals region in the western geographical litera-
ture (Braden, 2008) projected a highly unattractive image of
the Urals. There is, however, strong evidence that the
Russians themselves are far less negative in their perceptions
of the Urals. "Only the rocky Urals have turned out to pro-
vide fertile soil for a cultural blossoming," writes a literary
critic in her assessment of the latest developments in Russian
literary art (Margolina, 2007). Olga Slavnikova, the most
renowned Uralian young writer, though being deeply aware
of the region's economic and social wounds, finds poetic
words to describe its natural beauty and richness:
The picturesqueness of the Ural Mountains seems intentional . .
. Gentle lizards bask on heat-retaining outcrops of gold-laden
quartz; these are the Uralian's friends, living pointers to
subterranean riches. (Slavnikova, 2007a, pp. 76-77)
And, commenting on the famed resilience of the Uralian
people:
For the true Uralian, the land is rock, not soil. Here, he possesses
a profound--in the literal and figurative sense of the word--
geologically grounded truth. (Slavnikova, 2007a, p. 79)
It is true that after almost two decades of disastrous and
unpopular post-Soviet military-conversion course, the Urals,
as "Russia's defender" has largely lost its vividness. However,
the romantic "treasure box" sense is still present among
Uralians themselves, nurtured by the environmental and cul-
tural realities of the mountain region. In the above-mentioned
book on regional geography of Russia and the United States,
the Appalachian region, a counterpart of the Urals in the
United States, is portrayed as a tradition- and identity-
preserving area, in spite of the years of neglect "from above."
Tradition is an appropriate term to describe the peoples of
Appalachia. It is not difficult to understand the strong sense of
pride and identity the residents have to their region, nor to
understand why many people believe that the region has changed
little for the better in recent decades. (Rogachev & Brunn, 2008,
p. 22)
If the economic comparison of the Urals with the
American Appalachia is valid, it might be reasonable to
expect parallels in people's perceptions. Similar to the
8 SAGE Open
people of Appalachia, the Uralians have a strong sense of
pride and identity mixed with bitterness. While the bitterness
stems from the many unresolved socioeconomic issues that
still plague the region, the source of the pride is the Urals'
long glorious history as the country's manufacturer and
defender. In line with the sense of Russian nationalism forced
"from above," the stronghold image of the Urals is alive,
reinforced by the revival of mining and manufacturing activ-
ities. Where outside observers can distinguish only colored
smokes of metallurgical plants and the stench of polluted riv-
ers, the locals still discover the beauty of surrounding valleys
and hills. Whether it is the harsh climate and hostile living
conditions of the Urals, or the natural beauty of its landscape
and the mineral richness of the interior, the recent changes
have not altered the traditional "treasure box" image. The
indisputable evidence rises from the works of art following
the century long tradition of embracing the Urals' natural
beauty and wealth.
