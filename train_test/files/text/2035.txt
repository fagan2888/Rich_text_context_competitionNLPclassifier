background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a familial syndrome, associated with multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
factors. Thus, parents of affected women may have a higher prevalence of CVD events than the general population.
methods: PCOS probands (n ¼ 410) and their participating parents (n ¼ 180 fathers and 211 mothers) were queried for CVD events in
themselves and non-participating family members. In order to include the family CVD history of all parents, agreement between the proband
and parental reports of CVD events was assessed. Estimated 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was calculated using the Framing-
ham risk calculator. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001­2002 database was used to generate gender,
age and body mass index-relevant population parameters of CVD prevalence in the USA population.
results: Ninety-eight percent of the parents' self-reporting of CVD events agreed with the proband's report of parental heart attack
history [Kappa ¼ 0.82; 95% CI: (0.69, 0.94)] and 99% with parental stroke history [Kappa ¼ 0.79; 95% CI: (0.62, 0.97)]. Fathers of
women with PCOS had a higher prevalence of heart attack and stroke compared with the reference NHANES population (heart attack:
11.1 versus 5.3%, P , 0.0001; stroke: 3.0 versus 1.0%, P ¼ 0.002). Fathers of women with PCOS had an elevated 10-year risk for CHD
(11.5 versus 9.9% in NHANES, P ¼ 0.03). No statistically significant increased prevalence of CVD events or 10-year risk was noted in
probands or mothers.
conclusions: Fathers, and not mothers, may be disproportionately burdened with CVD in PCOS families. The strengths of this study
include the size of our cohort, the consistent phenotyping and the validation of proband's reporting of parental CVD events.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in
women in the USA. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a
common endocrine disorder, affecting 4­8% of reproductive-age
women (Azziz et al., 2004). In addition to ovulatory dysfunction and
hyperandrogenism, PCOS is associated with a constellation of meta-
bolic and CVD risk factors otherwise known as metabolic syndrome
(Ehrmann et al., 2006). In addition to dyslipidema (Legro et al.,
2001), women with PCOS have been noted to have high rates of
glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes (Ehrmann et al., 1999;
Legro et al., 1999), that are present even in adolescents (Palmert
et al., 2002).
Women with PCOS have an increased risk of subclinical athero-
sclerosis as indicated by endothelial dysfunction (Paradisi et al.,
2001), increased carotid artery intima media thickness (Talbott
et al., 2000), and increased coronary artery calcification compared
with reproductively normal control women of similar age and weight
(Christian et al., 2003). It has been suggested that, due to its preva-
lence and its metabolic risk factors, PCOS may account for a significant
proportion of atherosclerotic heart disease observed in women
(Dahlgren et al., 1992). Post-menopausal women with current or

past stigmata of PCOS have been shown to have a more severe CVD
event history and risk profile (Krentz et al., 2007; Shaw et al., 2008).
However, no prospective studies have established an association
between women with well-characterized PCOS and actual cardiovas-
cular events, or their premature onset (Legro, 2003).
Since age is a significant risk factor for CVD events, it may be that
studies have not followed cohorts of women with PCOS to an age
where CVD events become more common in women, the seventh
and eighth decades of life. The Nurse's Health Study has shown an
increased CVD event rate in post-menopausal women with a
history of oligomenorrhea during their reproductive years (Solomon
et al., 2002). Similarly, prospective studies of post-menopausal
women with androgen excess have shown them to have more
severe coronary artery disease and higher CVD event rates (Shaw
et al., 2008).
PCOS is likely a complex genetic disease (Ewens et al., 2010) that is
clearly modified by the environment (i.e. more severe phenotype with
obesity). We and others have shown that elevated CVD risk clusters
in first-degree relatives, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and dia-
betes (Legro et al., 2002b; Yildiz et al., 2003; Sam et al., 2006). Accord-
ingly, parents of affected women provide an opportunity to investigate
PCOS-related CVD risk in a population at an age where these events
become common, and also represent a group with environment and
genes shared with their daughters. We hypothesized that there would
be an increased CVD risk in parents of women with PCOS and an
increased prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk based on
the Framingham Risk Assessment Tool for estimating the 10-year risk
of developing CHD (myocardial infarction and coronary death).
Materials and Methods
Study subjects
Women with PCOS and their parents were recruited into an ongoing phe-
notype/genotype study of PCOS families between the years of 2001 and
2005. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of
Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the Penn
State College of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants.
PCOS probands were defined by the 1990 NIH-NICHD criteria of
hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation with exclusion of other etiologies
(Zawadski and Dunaif, 1992). To qualify as a PCOS proband, a woman
had to have six or fewer menses per year in addition to hyperandrogen-
emia defined by either total testosterone (T) more than 58 ng/dl and/
or non-sex hormone-binding globulin-bound T more than 15 ng/dl,
levels .2 SD values above the mean value established in reproductively
normal women aged 18­40-year-old in the early follicular phase of the
menstrual cycle (Legro et al., 1998). Probands were not taking any
confounding medications that alter sex steroid metabolism or insulin sen-
sitivity and were age 15­44 years. Non-classical 21-hydroxylase
deficiency, hyperprolactinemia, androgen-secreting tumors, thyroid
disease and pregnancy were excluded by appropriate tests before the
diagnosis of PCOS was made (Legro et al., 1998).
Study design
A total of 410 PCOS probands from the two participating sites were
studied, along with participating parents. The majority of the participants
resided in Pennsylvania; however, 35 states were represented for pro-
bands, 35 states for mothers and 34 states for fathers. We obtained
medical history, biometric information and fasting blood according to
our standard phenotyping protocol (Legro et al., 1998). Standardized
forms were used to obtain personal medical history, including history of
cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, tobacco
use and current prescription medications. The participant was asked to
recall any `heart attack' or `stroke' within their immediate family, requiring
that they specify during which of three age ranges the event occurred for
that family member: ,55 years, 55­65 years, .65 years or age unknown.
Subjects who completed the study on-site had their blood pressure,
height and weight measurements performed by clinical research staff.
Some of the subjects were studied off-site. Off-site subjects self-reported
their height and weight measurements. We have previously validated self-
reported height and weight (Sam et al., 2006). All subjects had blood
samples, which were obtained in the morning after an overnight fast,
and levels of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol were assayed (Legro et al., 2002a). Data on reproductive and meta-
bolic phenotypes, including fasting glucose, lipid and lipoprotein levels,
have been reported on some of the probands and mothers and fathers
(Sam et al., 2006; Stewart et al., 2006; Coviello et al., 2009).
Reference population
In order to determine the prevalence of CVD events and risk factors in a
reference group, we used a US population-based sample of comparable
gender, mean age and mean BMI data abstracted from the nationwide
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001­2002
database (www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). All records from the NHANES
database were selected such that they were gender appropriate,
within +1 year in age, and within+ 0.5 kg/m2 in BMI of subjects in
each of our subsets (probands, mothers and fathers) (Sam et al., 2006;
Coviello et al., 2009). NHANES 2001­2002 contains data on anthropo-
metric measurements, blood pressure and fasting glucose and lipid levels
and was sampled from all U.S. households during this time frame.
Framingham CHD score
A CVD risk score was calculated for subjects aged 20 years and older who
had no cardiovascular events or diagnosis of diabetes using the online
National Cholesterol Education Program calculator (http://hp2010.
nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp). We chose this method because it is
commonly used clinically and has been validated in other populations in
the USA (D'Agostino et al., 2001). The algorithm predicts the 10-year
risk of coronary events using the following measurements: age, gender,
total and HDL cholesterol levels, smoking status, current use of anti-
hypertensive medications and systolic blood pressure. These parameters
were measured at the time of the subject's visit to the center and from
information noted in their completed medical history.
Statistical analysis
Many parents did not participate in the study and thus were not pheno-
typed. Exclusion of non-studied parents could potentially bias the
results, for example, a non-studied parent may have been unable to par-
ticipate in the study due to death or incapacitation from a CVD event. The
inclusion of non-studied parents in the analysis to reduce this potential bias
required the use of proband reporting of non-studied parental CVD
events. Validation for using proband reporting of parental CVD events
was undertaken by calculating the kappa statistic and 95% confidence
interval to assess the agreement between the probands and their
studied parents' reporting of parental CVD events.
The selected NHANES data as described under the Reference Popu-
lation section was weighted appropriately as per NHANES study instruc-
tions to provide population parameters of heart attack, stroke and 10-year
Framingham CHD risk score. The one-sample binomial exact test was

used to compare heart attack and stroke prevalence in the PCOS families
with the reference population from NHANES. The one-sample t-test was
used to compare the Framingham 10-year CHD risk of the PCOS families
to the NHANES reference population.
Results
Validation of proband reports of parental
CVD history
Proband parental history reports were compared with the surveys
completed by their respective parents. Two hundred eleven
mothers (52%) completed surveys and were included in the validation
process. One hundred eighty fathers (44%) completed surveys and
were included in the validation process. Ninety-eight percent (379/
387) of the parents were in agreement with the proband's report of
parental heart attack history [Kappa ¼ 0.82; 95% CI: (0.69, 0.94)].
Ninety-nine percent (371/376) were in agreement with the proband's
report of parental stroke history [Kappa ¼ 0.79; 95% CI: (0.62, 0.97)].
Cardiovascular events
Demographic characteristics of the PCOS probands, mothers and
fathers and their respective NHANES reference groups displayed in
Tables I and II show the prevalence of cardiovascular events in the
different subject populations. We found only one self-reported CVD
event in a PCOS proband: a stroke at age 12. Given that an exponen-
tial increase in CVD events occurs for men at age 55 years, 56% of our
fathers qualified as being in the higher-risk age group. The prevalence
of heart attack and stroke in fathers of women with PCOS was signifi-
cantly increased compared with the NHANES population. All other
occurrences of CVD events in PCOS probands and mothers were
not significant compared with our reference population. However,
the exponential increase in CVD events occurs for women at age
65 years; only 7% of our mothers were in the higher-risk age group.
10-year calculated CHD risk
The factors shown in Table III were used to estimate the Framingham
10-year CHD risk for the different subject populations. Subjects were
only included in this analysis if we had complete information on all risk
factors included in the Framingham calculation. The proband fathers
had an increased risk profile compared with the NHANES population
(P ¼ 0.03; Table IV). The 10-year CHD risk for both probands and
their mothers did not differ from their respective NHANES population.
Discussion
Our study noted an increased prevalence of heart attack (11.1 versus
5.3%) and stroke (3.0 versus 1.0%), as well as an increased 10-year

CHD risk in fathers of women with PCOS compared with population
parameters obtained from men in the NHANES 2001­2002 database
of similar age and BMI. There was no statistically significant increased
prevalence of events in women with PCOS or their mothers, nor was
there an increased 10-year CHD risk compared with the women in
the NHANES 2001­2002 database of similar age and BMI. Our
study thus suggests that first-degree male members of PCOS families
have both increased risk and corresponding event rates, whereas
females are relatively normal.
Several studies have investigated the risk of CVD in family members
of women with PCOS (Atiomo et al., 2003; Yilmaz et al., 2005; Hunter
et al., 2007). These studies have been limited by small sample sizes
(,100 subjects). In addition, control populations for these studies
were small and ascertained from disparate sources, for example,
from infertility clinics. Thus, the control populations were subject to
selection bias and were, perhaps, not representative of the larger
population. Hunter et al. (2007) showed an increased CVD risk in
brothers but not fathers of women with PCOS based on survey of
the proband with PCOS. This study was limited by an inconsistent
diagnosis of PCOS and by the fact that the investigators did not
survey or phenotype the other first-degree relatives. Yilmaz et al.
(2005) showed an increased risk of CVD in both fathers and
mothers of women with PCOS. This study was designed similarly to
ours, and our mothers' ages were overlapping. Atiomo et al. (2003)
showed an increased number of women with PCOS who had a posi-
tive family history of heart attacks. However, it is unclear what signified
a parental history of heart attacks for the study, as it was not specified
if the affected family member was a parent, sibling, aunt/uncle or
grandparent.
Our study finds an increased risk for CVD events only in fathers.
This is consistent with our previous studies noting clustering of CVD
risk factors in first-degree male relatives of probands (Sam et al.,
2008; Coviello et al., 2009). The mechanism for this is beyond the
scope of the study. However, the increased prevalence of hyperten-
sion and use of hypertensive medications among the fathers who
were phenotyped compared with the NHANES reference group
suggests this significant CVD risk factor was a major contributor to
our findings. Our failure to detect an increased risk of CVD events
in affected women and their mothers may reflect their relatively
young age since CVD events do not become prevalent in women
until the seventh to eighth decades of life. Given that an exponential
increase in CVD events occurs for men at age 55 years, 56% of our
fathers qualified as being in the higher-risk age group. However, the
exponential increase in CVD events occurs for women at age 65
years; only 7% of our mothers are in the higher-risk age group. It is,
therefore, possible that our results may differ were we to enroll
older female subjects or to observe our present cohort longer.
We also did not find an increased 10-year risk of CVD events in
women with PCOS or their mothers, in contrast to previous studies
(Yilmaz et al., 2005; Cheang et al., 2008). This observation may
reflect the fact that while there were relative abnormalities in risk
factors in women compared with a reference population, including
in our own previous studies (Sam et al., 2008; Coviello et al., 2009),
they were not substantial enough to increase the calculated CVD
risk score. Alternatively, there may be some aspects of PCOS that
are protective against CVD events. For example, prolonged ovarian
reserve in women with PCOS may provide a longer window of
sex steroid production and cardiovascular protection in women
(Mulders et al., 2004; Tehrani et al., 2010).
Our study, like all of the others on the topic, was limited by the ret-
rospective nature of the study and by the relatively small sample size.
Though cardiovascular events are major life-changing occurrances, it is
possible that recall bias may lead to lapses in the parent either directly
documenting it or communicating it to their daughters. Although

CVD in PCOS Fathers 2229
compared with similar studies of families of women with PCOS, ours
is quite large, from an epidemiologic viewpoint, it is still a small study
with a sample size of 410 families. Our study was strengthened by
standardized phenotyping of subjects with PCOS and by systematic,
prospective collection of CVD event history. Further, we have vali-
dated that a proband report of a parental CVD event had a high con-
cordance with the parent report (98% for heart attack and stroke).
This concordance reduced the likelihood of underestimating of event
rates when a parent was lost to follow-up due to a fatal or incapacitat-
ing CVD event. The NHANES data allow for comparison with a large
cross section of the U.S. general population. However, there were
differences in the recruitment of subjects and the ascertainment of
outcomes between NHANES and our study that could confound
our findings. For example, the history of events was obtained by
in-person home interview in NHANES and by standardized question-
naire in our study, potentially resulting in selective reporting of actual
events. Further we chose a time point in the NHANES data that was
roughly halfway between our start and completion date for this study,
such that changing cardiovascular event rates could alter our findings.
Finally, it is impossible with such a study design to control for all
confounding factors between the NHANES study and our case
series. For example, we did not control for smoking, and we found
higher rates of diabetes in our families than in the NHANES reference
population. The prevalence of diabetes in our probands was 5%, in
our mothers was 17%, and in our fathers was 20%. Whereas in the
gender and age-relevant NHANES population it was 2% for probands,
6% for mothers and 11% for fathers. However, based on the patho-
physiology of PCOS as a disorder of insulin resistance, we would
expect this diabetes discrepancy.
As awareness and proper diagnosis of PCOS increases, larger
studies of the long-term comorbidities of this syndrome will become
more feasible. We conclude that there is an increase in CVD events
and risk in fathers of women with PCOS. This is a distinct population
who can be targeted for early screening and surveillance for CVD.
Study of shared environment and genes may shed light on a
common etiology to PCOS in daughters and CVD disease in fathers.
