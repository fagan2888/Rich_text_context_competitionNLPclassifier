Abstract
Background: Clinician training deficits and a low and declining autopsy rate adversely impact the quality
of death certificates in the United States. Self-report and records data for the general population indicate
that proximate mental and physical health of minority suicides was at least as poor as that of white suicides.
Methods: This cross-sectional mortality study uses data from Multiple Cause-of-Death (MCOD) public
use files for 1999­2003 to describe and evaluate comorbidity among black, Hispanic, and white suicides.
Unintentional injury decedents are the referent for multivariate analyses.
Results: One or more mentions of comorbid psychopathology are documented on the death certificates
of 8% of white male suicides compared to 4% and 3% of black and Hispanic counterparts, respectively.
Corresponding female figures are 10%, 8%, and 6%. Racial-ethnic discrepancies in the prevalence of
comorbid physical disease are more attenuated. Cross-validation with National Violent Death Reporting
System data reveals high relative underenumeration of comorbid depression/mood disorders and high
relative overenumeration of schizophrenia on the death certificates of both minorities. In all three racial-
ethnic groups, suicide is positively associated with depression/mood disorders [whites: adjusted odds ratio
(AOR) = 31.9, 95% CI = 29.80­34.13; blacks: AOR = 60.9, 95% CI = 42.80­86.63; Hispanics: AOR = 34.7,
95% CI = 23.36­51.62] and schizophrenia [whites: AOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 2.07­2.86; blacks: AOR = 4.2,
95% CI = 2.73­6.37; Hispanics: AOR = 4.1, 95% CI = 2.01­8.22]. Suicide is positively associated with
cancer in whites [AOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.69­1.93] and blacks [AOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.36­2.48], but not
with HIV or alcohol and other substance use disorders in any group under review.
Conclusion: The multivariate analyses indicate high consistency in predicting suicide-associated
comorbidities across racial-ethnic groups using MCOD data. However, low prevalence of documented
comorbid psychopathology in suicides, and concomitant racial-ethnic discrepancies underscore the need
for training in death certification, and routinization and standardization of timely psychological autopsies
in all cases of suicide, suspected suicide, and other traumatic deaths of equivocal cause.

Background
Suicide kills far more Americans than homicide, its twin
and much higher profile cause of fatal intentional injury.
For 1999­2003, the observation period for this study, the
annualized suicide rate for the United States was almost
double the homicide rate ­ 11 versus 6 per 100,000 pop-
ulation [1]. Suicide ranked fourth as a cause of potential
years of life lost before age 65 years for (non-Hispanic)
whites, seventh for Hispanics, and ninth for (non-His-
panic) blacks. Suicide is avoidable mortality [2,3], and the
proximate mental and physical health of decedents is sali-
ent to its understanding. To better comprehend the rela-
tionship between proximate health and suicide, we
accessed national vital statistics data to describe and eval-
uate comorbidity in white, black, and Hispanic suicides.
Untenable as biological constructs, race and ethnicity are
social constructs with important implications for health
disparities and healthcare delivery [4]. Questions about
the reliability and validity of multiple cause-of-death data
added impetus to our research.
Although we assume that black and Hispanic suicides
experienced at least as much proximate mental and phys-
ical illness as white suicides, we expect that medicolegal
authorities record less comorbidity on their death certifi-
cates. This assumption and expectation stem primarily
from comparative survey research on the general US pop-
ulation. A study utilizing the Sample Adult component of
the 1998­2003 National Health Interview Surveys
showed that blacks and Hispanics report being in worse
health, having more physical limitations and annual bed
days, less health insurance coverage, fewer physician vis-
its, and more unmet mental healthcare needs than whites
[5]. These groups also compare unfavorably on objective
measures of healthcare access and management [6]. With
the focus more specifically on mental health, an analysis
of the 2005­2006 National and Nutrition Examination
Survey showed that blacks had a higher prevalence of
depression than whites and Hispanics [7]. An analysis of
the 2001­2004 National Health Interview Survey indi-
cated no difference in the prevalence of serious psycholog-
ical distress between blacks and whites [8]. While the
prevalence was equivalent between Hispanics and whites
at ages 18 through 64 years, it was almost three times
higher for Hispanics at ages 65 and older. Limited to a
comparison between blacks and whites, the National Sur-
vey of American Life revealed 45% excess chronicity in
major depressive disorder among blacks [9]. Turning back
to racial-ethnic treatment disparities, an analysis of the
Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys found
that 36% of Latinos and 41% of African-Americans with a
past-year depressive disorder had received mental health
treatment compared to 60% of non-Latino whites [10].
Our expectation of relative underdocumentation of comor-
bidity on the death certificates of the minority suicides is
partially supported by a records-based study [11]. Subjects
were adult enrollees in TennCare, Tennessee's Medicaid-
waiver managed care program, a public assistance program
which offers equal financial access to all low-income
groups [12]. This study found that only 29% of African-
American suicides and possible suicides, as compared to
51% of white opposites, used prescribed antidepressants in
the year prior to their deaths [11]. The authors interpreted
this differential as indirect evidence that serious mood dis-
orders are underdiagnosed or undertreated in African-
Americans. However, they acknowledged that African-
Americans may have been more likely to receive nonphar-
macological therapy than whites, and thus could have been
less likely to have antidepressant prescriptions filled. They
operationalized their possible suicides as decedents whose
deaths were officially classified under injury of undeter-
mined intent, and no subjects had a record of chronic psy-
chosis or serious medical illness.
Meta-analyses which combine studies of predominantly
patient samples affirm that both comorbid psychopathol-
ogy and physical disease are suicide determinants [13-16].
Reinforcement comes from two national multiple cause-
of-death (MCOD) analyses, an Australian suicide study
[17] and a US replication [18]. Implying high bi-national
reliability of MCOD data, comparison of their multivari-
ate results revealed identical suicide-associated comorbid-
ities: depression and mood disorders, schizophrenia, and
cancer. By contrast, gender-specific prevalences of comor-
bid psychopathology were almost three times as high in
Australian suicides. Moreover, the prevalence of comor-
bid physical disease was twice as high in Australian as US
male suicides, and there was 78% excess prevalence
among Australian female suicides compared to US coun-
terparts. The magnitude of these prevalence gaps was sur-
prising, as was the revelation that only among Australian
suicides was comorbid psychopathology more prevalent
than comorbid physical disease. While both nations are
economically and technologically sophisticated democra-
cies, with a shared suicide rate of 11 per 100,000 popula-
tion [1,19], life expectancy and healthy life expectancy at
birth in Australia exceed US expectancies by approxi-
mately three years [20,21]. Indeed, the prevalence gaps
and differential weight of comorbid psychopathology
indicate that Australian death certificates surpass those of
the United States in documenting true comorbidity
among suicides. We subsequently ascertained that Aus-
tralian death investigations are more standardized than
those in the United States, and that US coders have less
capacity than Australian counterparts to access medicole-
gal records to help resolve outstanding questions [[22];
personal communication, Robert N. Anderson, National
Center for Health Statistics, September 22, 2008].
Death certificates are essential for conducting epidemio-
logic surveillance, planning and prioritizing healthcare

expenditures and services, and formulating policy for pre-
venting traumatic deaths at state and national levels.
Moreover, mortality data from the National Vital Statistics
System are more universal, standardized, and timely than
data from other major health databases [23]. Neverthe-
less, critics cite persuasive empirical evidence from valida-
tion studies to charge that death certificates are seriously
deficient [24-27], In the mid-1990s, a survey of over 700
medical examiners and coroners showed that few had
received any formal training in death certification in their
medical school training or residencies [28]. Death certifi-
cation still receives scant attention in medical school and
hospital training [29-31]. An additional complicating fac-
tor is the declining adult autopsy rate, from 18% in 1955
to just 8% by 2003 [32]. Both a low autopsy rate and train-
ing deficits will impede ascertainment and recording of
comorbidity on the death certificates of suicides. We are
motivated by these factors and the US-Australian preva-
lence gaps, as well as by the healthcare utilization litera-
ture, to assess whether comorbidity is underdocumented
in black and Hispanic suicides relative to white suicides.
Methods
MCOD public use files from the National Vital Statistics
System within the National Center for Health Statistics are
our data source for this cross-sectional mortality study. To
help stabilize age-, gender-, and racial-ethnic-specific
comorbidity prevalence estimates, we chose a five-year
observation period, 1999­2003. Causes of death were
precoded under the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision ICD-10
[33]. Our study group comprised white, black, and His-
panic decedents whose underlying cause of death was
intentional self-harm (X60­X84) or sequelae of inten-
tional self-harm (Y87.0).
We employed a comparison group in order to identify sui-
cide-associated comorbidities through multivariate analy-
sis. This group comprised white, black, and Hispanic
decedents whose underlying cause of death was uninten-
tional injury (V01­X59), sequelae of transport uninten-
tional injury (Y85), or sequelae of other unintentional
injury (Y86). We further confined our study and compar-
ison groups to persons who died at ages 15 years or older
in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Fifteen years
was the minimum age cutoff because suicide was rarely
reported among children and younger teens [34], who
constituted less than 1% of all suicides during the obser-
vation period. [1] Relevant given the nature of the racial-
ethnic comparisons in this study, Hispanic blacks com-
prised only 1% of Hispanic suicide subjects. This finding
holds independent of gender.
Suicide almost invariably becomes the official underlying
cause of death when medicolegal authorities rule a death
as suicide in a timely manner [35]. Concordance between
a suicidal mention on the death certificate and its assign-
ment as the underlying cause approaches 100% [36].
Unlike deaths attributed to a chronic disease, comorbidity
enumerated on the death certificates of suicides is almost
necessarily antecedent owing to the typically acute nature
of injury mortality. However, antecedence does not imply
causality.
Replicating the methods of the prior US MCOD suicide
study [18] in a racial-ethnic context, we disaggregated
comorbidity into 14 types within two major subheadings:
mental/behavioral disorders and physical disease. Our
prevalence calculations drew upon all potential comorbid
mentions on a death certificate ­ up to 20. However, we
counted only one condition where more than one was
associated with a particular type of comorbidity. Each of
the 14 types served as a distinct outcome variable in a
series of unconditional logistic regression analyses that we
performed to identify suicide-associated comorbidities in
the MCOD dataset for whites, blacks, and Hispanics,
respectively. We adjusted the odds ratios for age (three
ordinal categories: 15­34, 35­64, and 65+ years) and gen-
der. Our results provide a preliminary basis for assessing
the reliability of the comorbidity data in relation to sui-
cide. In a sensitivity analysis we eliminated our covariates,
age and gender, from the model. All variables derived
from the MCOD database.
Sampling variability was not an issue in this study since
the data represented complete counts. However, to allow
for random variation in our cross-tabulated prevalence
data on suicides, we conducted two series of Chi-square
tests before reporting on differentials and patterns. Our
first series were two-by-three tests. For each category of
comorbidity, distinguishing presence or absence, we sep-
arately assessed statistically significant variation within
gender and across racial-ethnic groups and age groups,
respectively. These results justified our series of two-by-
two tests. In these tests we compared white suicides with
black suicides and Hispanic suicides, respectively, within
specific comorbidity categories for all ages and also within
each of our three age groups for each gender. Then sepa-
rately for each racial-ethnic group within gender, we sim-
ilarly compared cause-specific comorbidity prevalences
across these age groups. To assess change in prevalence
across age, we simply compared the youngest age group
with the middle age group and then the middle group
with the oldest group. In the prevalence tables, we identi-
fied each estimate which was calculated on the basis of a
cell size with fewer than 20 cases.
To address the question of whether comorbidity was rela-
tively underdocumented on the death certificates of
minority suicides, we cross-validated selected prevalence

data from our study with corresponding data for 2004
from a CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
study which utilized the US National Violent Death
Reporting System (NVDRS) [37]. Approximating a real-
time environment, the NVDRS combines data from the
offices of coroners and medical examiners, police reports,
death certificates, toxicology laboratories, and interviews
with family and friends of the decedents. Our cross-vali-
dation was confined to schizophrenia and depression and
mood disorders, given accessible NVDRS data. We com-
puted black-to-white and Hispanic-to-white prevalence
ratios for a given type of comorbidity in each study. Then
for the two minorities separately, we calculated the ratio
difference as a percentage of the initial ratio, which served
as the criterion standard. The product estimated the
degree of underreporting or overreporting of a condition
among black or Hispanic suicides relative to white sui-
cides. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (ver-
sion 9.13, Cary, NC).
Results
Prevalence of comorbidity
We first report on differentials in the prevalence of comor-
bidity documented on death certificates between white
and minority suicides and also on within-group patterns
(Tables 1, 2, 3). We highlight only statistically significant
variations ( ; p < 0.05). Psychopathology is more than
twice as prevalent among white male suicides compared
to minority counterparts (Table 1). Specifically, 8% of
white male suicides have at least one mention of comor-
bid psychopathology documented on their death certifi-
cate, compared to 4% of black male suicides and 3% of
Hispanic male suicides. Corresponding figures for female
suicides are 10%, 8%, and 6%. While manifesting less
minority-majority divergence than in the case of comor-
bid psychopathology, the prevalence of comorbid physi-
cal disease documented on the death certificates of male
suicides is lower for blacks and Hispanics than for whites.
Among female suicides, the prevalence is only lower than
whites for Hispanics. Confined to subjects with comor-
bidity documented on their death certificates, mean
number of mentions does not vary with majority-minor-
ity status.
Tables 2 (males) and 3 (females) show the prevalence of
documented comorbid psychopathology and physical
disease disaggregated by age and racial-ethnicity. Comor-
bidity as a whole increases monotonically with age except
among Hispanic female suicides. Comorbid physical dis-
ease peaks at the oldest ages. By contrast, comorbid psy-
chopathology peaks at middle age except among black
female suicides. Hispanic males aside, mood disorders
and depression predominate among psychopathologies
irrespective of gender. These conditions are four times
more prevalent among white male suicides than corre-
sponding Hispanics and nearly three times more preva-
lent than in corresponding blacks. The prevalence of
mood disorders and depression in white female suicides
is twice as high as in Hispanic counterparts and 1.5 times
higher than in black counterparts. The prevalence of circu-
latory disease is relatively high among black female sui-
cides and white suicides of both genders.
Suicide-associated comorbidities
With odds ratios adjusted for age and sex, and uninten-
tional injury decedents as the referent, logistic regression
analyses of suicide-associated comorbidities reveal many
similarities and some differences across racial-ethnic
groups (Table 4). Suicide is positively associated with

schizophrenia and mood disorders and depression in all
three racial-ethnic groups. It is positively associated with
cancer among whites and blacks only, and with residual
mental health disorders among whites and Hispanics. A
positive link between suicide and nervous system disease
is limited to Hispanics. Although the point-estimated
odds ratio for suicide-associated mood disorders and
depression is strikingly high across all three racial-ethnic
groups, black suicides are 61 times more likely than black
unintentional injury decedents to have such diagnoses
recorded on their death certificates. Main results are not
modified by the elimination of age and gender as covari-
ates from the basic multivariate model.
Cross-validation
In comparing our prevalence data with the criterion stand-
ard, NVDRS data, we are reporting on the two psycho-
pathologies positively associated with suicide in each of
the three study groups; namely, mood disorders and
depression, and schizophrenia. White suicides in the
NVDRS register seven times more comorbid mood disor-
ders and depression, under an additivity assumption, and
14 times more comorbid schizophrenia than white coun-
terparts in the MCOD dataset (Table 5). Respective black-
to-white and Hispanic-to-white prevalence ratios indicate
substantial underreporting in the MCOD dataset of
comorbid mood disorders and depression for minority
suicides relative to white suicides. By contrast, there is evi-
dence of high relative overreporting of comorbid schizo-
phrenia.
Discussion
Not limited to patient populations, MCOD data offer a
unique and enduring record of comorbidity among com-
pleted suicides in the United States. We used these data for
the period 1999­2003 to compare and critically evaluate
comorbidity among suicides in three racial-ethnic groups:
whites, blacks, and Hispanics. As we expected, but con-
trary to health disparities in the general population, less
comorbid psychopathology is documented on the death
certificates of black and Hispanic suicides than those of
white counterparts. Collectively, our study and its prede-
cessors [17,18] make us rather sanguine about the reliabil-
ity of MCOD data in predicting suicide-associated
comorbidities. By contrast, we are skeptical about the
validity or, more particularly, the sensitivity of comorbid-
ity that is documented on the death certificates of suicides.
Resting on limited cross-validation with NVDRS data
[37], we infer that mood disorders and depression,
although not schizophrenia, are profoundly underdocu-
mented on death certificates for blacks and Hispanics rel-
ative to whites.
Even the NVDRS is likely to be wanting in the documen-
tation of comorbid psychopathology among suicides. For
if we emphasize the absolute instead of the relative, psy-
chological autopsy studies provide compelling evidence
that comorbid psychopathology is probably grossly
under-documented on the death certificates of suicides
irrespective of racial-ethnicity and type of disorder. A
meta-analysis of 27 of these in-depth studies of record
reviews and interviews with survivors estimated that 87%
of suicides had a mental disorder [38]. A systematic
review, which included meta-analyses conducted sepa-
rately on 22 case-control studies and 54 case series,
reported 90% prevalence of mental disorders in suicide
cases compared to 27% in controls, and 91% prevalence
in suicides from the case series [39]. Few of the case-con-
trol studies involved US adults.
HIV was not a determinant of suicide in any of the three
racial-ethnic groups in our study, even though a 1994
meta-analysis identified this disease as a risk factor [13].
This finding more refinedly affirmed such a finding from

the first US MCOD suicide study [18]. Posited by the
authors of that study as an ex post facto explanation,
receipt of effective antiviral therapy could have altered the
mindset of HIV-positives by removing a hitherto immi-
nent and grave threat to survival. Thus, if tenable, minor-
ity-majority status may not modify this explanation. To
that point, another recent US study attributed a relative
reduction in HIV mortality to some closure of the life
expectancy gap separating blacks from whites [40]. Never-
theless, blacks and Hispanics continue to bear a dispro-
portionate share of the diminishing national HIV/AIDS
burden [41,42]. The absence of HIV as a suicide determi-
nant in these groups may be a marker of success by the
healthcare system in delivering appropriate therapy to
minority HIV-positives. Epidemiologists and social scien-
tists may further clarify the relationship between HIV and
suicide utilizing longitudinal data.
A longitudinal evaluation of race and Hispanic origin on
death certificates indicated excellent agreement between
self-report and death certificate proxy report for blacks
and whites and good agreement for Hispanic subgroups
[43]. Nevertheless, our results could have been distorted
by racial-ethnic heterogeneity, such as between African-
Americans and black Caribbean Americans and native-
born and foreign-born Hispanics, respectively
[5,9,44,45]. For example, an analysis of the 2001­2002
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related
Conditions showed that Mexican-Americans manifested a
lower lifetime risk of psychiatric comorbidity than US-
born non-Hispanic whites [46]. There was, however, no
differentiation of risk among their foreign-born counter-
parts.
Racial-ethnic variation in the respective prevalences of
comorbid psychopathology and physical disease may be
real, and simply reflect differences in suicide etiology [47-
53]. Alternatively, the data are consistent with our expec-
tation that this variation may be partially or wholly arti-
factual. Such artifactuality would likely be a function of
interactions between family, friends, and acquaintances
of decedents with medicolegal authorities, variations in
social pressure to withhold psychological information
across racial and ethnic groups, and differential fastidi-
ousness with which authorities compile medical records
on suicides. However, this research could not assess the
merits or relative contributions of these factors. Beyond
the highly restricted comparisons, our cross-validation of
the documentation of comorbid psychopathology on
death certificates of suicides was further constrained by
the fact that the NVDRS covers only a minority of states ­
14 states in 2004 and 17 currently [54]. Moreover, this
system comingles personal reports from family and
friends on the proximate mental status of decedents with
diagnostic data. Thus, any improvement in the sensitivity
of documentation of comorbid psychopathology among
suicides, rendered by the NVDRS, likely means dimin-
ished specificity.
Gaps between minority and white suicides in comorbidity
prevalence, which we estimated from MCOD data, are
attenuated for physical disease compared to psychopa-
thology. While unable to validate a relative data deficit for
any physical disease, as we did for two types of psychopa-
thology, the observed gaps are congruent with previously
documented and variable healthcare utilization and
access. Returning to psychopathology, we found no asso-
ciation between alcohol use or other substance use disor-
ders and suicide ­ a result mirroring findings from prior
MCOD studies [17,18]. These relationships are probably
complex. For example, an analysis of data from the 1993
US National Mortality Followback Survey showed that
problem drinking was positively associated with suicide
in whites but negatively associated in blacks [55]. A cross-
national systematic review of the relationship between
alcohol use disorders and injury in hospital emergency
department patients inferred a weak association [56]. In
our study, positive links between both alcohol and other
substance use disorders and suicide may have been
masked by the universal strength of the depression-sui-
cide nexus or by our conventional choice of unintentional
injury decedents as the control population. A study limi-
tation is that a change in the coding of education in the
MCOD dataset for 2003 precluded us from incorporating
educational attainment as a covariate, and as the only
potentially suitable proxy for socioeconomic status, in our
regression analyses.
Conclusion
A comprehensive and accurate record of comorbidity on
death certificates would advance suicide surveillance well
beyond the capacity afforded by underlying cause-of-
death information alone. Researchers could utilize
enhanced data to fortify the evidence base for suicide, not
only through improving description, but by better
informing etiology, policy, prevention, and evaluation.
Substantial amelioration of likely relevant comorbidity
documentation for all racial-ethnic groups would follow
from a formal commitment by medical schools and teach-
ing hospitals to train students and residents in death cer-
tification, implementation of equivalent in-service
training for practicing providers, and routinization and
standardization of timely psychological autopsies in all
cases of suicide, suspected suicide, and other traumatic
deaths of equivocal cause. While these actions would
improve understanding of suicide and lead to more effec-
tive interventions, we predict that some racial-ethnic gaps
in the documentation of comorbidity among suicides will
persist as long as access to and utilization of healthcare
remain incommensurate with need. We plan to expand
our research by examining comorbidity among possible
suicides. Results may have implications for improving the
BMC Psychiatry 2009, 9:10 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/9/10

sensitivity of suicide certification across racial-ethnic
groups. Attention has been drawn to a racial paradox;
namely, that while blacks manifest a risk for suicide equal
to or greater than that of whites, their suicide rate is less
than half [57]. Variable ascertainment of comorbid
depression or cancer, for example, might contribute to
this paradox through differentially affecting the tipping
point where authorities rule a true suicide a suicide.
