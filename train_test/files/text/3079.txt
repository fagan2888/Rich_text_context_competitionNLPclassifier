Background: Periodontal disease has been found to be
a potential risk factor for coronary heart disease. How-
ever, its association with cerebrovascular accidents(CVAs)
is much less studied.
Methods: This study examines the association between
periodontal disease and CVA. The study cohort com-
prises 9962 adults aged 25 to 74 years who participated
in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey and its follow-up study. Baseline periodontal sta-
tus was categorized into (1) no periodontal disease, (2)
gingivitis, (3) periodontitis, and (4) edentulousness. All
CVAs (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion [ICD-9], codes 430-438) were ascertained by hospi-
tal records for nonfatal events and death certificates for
fatal events. The first CVA, nonfatal or fatal, was used to
define incidence. Relative risks were estimated by hazard
ratios from the Cox proportional hazard model with ad-
justment for several demographic variables and well-
established cardiovascular risk factors. Weights were used
to generate risk estimates.
Results: Periodontitis is a significant risk factor for
total CVA and, in particular, nonhemorrhagic stroke
(ICD-9, 433-434 and 436-438). Compared with no peri-
odontal disease, the relative risks (95% confidence
intervals) for incident nonhemorrhagic stroke were
1.24 (0.74-2.08) for gingivitis, 2.11 (1.30-3.42) for peri-
odontitis, and 1.41 (0.96-2.06) for edentulousness. For
total CVA, the results were 1.02 (0.70-1.48) for gingivi-
tis, 1.66 (1.15-2.39) for periodontitis, and 1.23 (0.91-
1.66) for edentulousness. Increased relative risks for to-
tal CVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke associated with
periodontitis were also seen in white men, white women,
and African Americans. Similar results were found for
fatal CVA.
Conclusion: Periodontal disease is an important risk fac-
tor for total CVA and, in particular, nonhemorrhagic
stroke.

THE ROLE of infection in the
etiology of atherosclerosis
and the development of car-
diovascular disease has re-
cently received consider-
able attention.1 Periodontal disease, one
of the most common human infections, has
been found to be a risk factor for coro-
nary heart disease in a number of stud-
ies.2-9 However, the association between
periodontal disease and the risk for cere-
brovascular accident (CVA) is much less
studied. The purpose of this study was to
examine the association between base-
line periodontal status and subsequent in-
cidence and mortality of CVA in a repre-
sentative sample of US adults.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study cohort are
given in Table 1. Among the unweighted
study sample of 9962 participants, 62.0%
were women; 16.8%, African Americans;
and 36.7%, current smokers at baseline.
The mean age for the whole sample was
48.31 years; mean BMI, 25.7 kg/m2; and
mean serum total cholesterol level, 5.68
mmol/L (219.77 mg/dL). The baseline
weighted prevalence rates for periodon-
tal disease were gingivitis, 25.3%; peri-
odontitis, 16.8%; and edentulousness,
16.8%.
For the study cohort as a whole, to-
tal person-years of follow-up were
158294.05 for incident and 161065.13
for fatal CVAs (Table 2). During the fol-
low-up period, there were 803 incident
CVAs, including 596 nonhemorrhagic
strokes, 91 hemorrhagic strokes, and 116
transient cerebral ischemic events (ICD-9
435). Fatal CVAs totaled 282, including
230 nonhemorrhagic and 52 hemor-
rhagic strokes. The incidence rates per

1000 person-years of follow-up were 5.1 for total
CVA, 3.8 for nonhemorrhagic stroke, and 0.6 for hem-
orrhagic stroke. The mortality rates per 1000 person-
years were 1.8 for total CVA, 1.4 for nonhemorrhagic
stroke, and 0.3 for hemorrhagic stroke. Poorer peri-
odontal status was associated with increased incidence
and mortality for all CVA outcomes. For example, the
age-adjusted incidence rates for total CVA per 1000
years of follow-up were 4.7 for participants with no
periodontal disease, 5.2 for those with gingivitis, 7.0
for those with periodontitis, and 7.2 for those who
were edentulous.
After adjustment for a number of demographic
variables and several well-established risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, periodontitis was significantly
associated with an increased risk for total CVA and
nonhemorrhagic stroke, but not for hemorrhagic
stroke (Table 3). Compared with no periodontal dis-
ease, RRs (95% CIs) of incident CVA were 1.02 (0.70-
1.48) for gingivitis, 1.66 (1.15-2.39) for periodontitis,
and 1.23 (0.91-1.66) for edentulousness; RRs (95%
CI) of incident nonhemorrhagic stroke were 1.24
(0.74-2.08), 2.11 (1.30-3.42), and 1.41 (0.96-2.06),
respectively. Estimates of RR for edentulousness were
METHODS
DATA AND STUDY SAMPLE
Data from the First National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES I)10 and its Epidemiologic Fol-
low-up Study (NHEFS)11-14 were analyzed; NHANES I was
a cross-sectional study of a representative sample of the US
noninstitutionalized civilian population aged 1 to 74 years.10
The study was conducted during the years 1971 through
1974 and augmented by an additional national sample in
1974 and 1975. The survey included a standardized medi-
cal examination and questionnaires that covered various
health-related topics. The dental examination was con-
ducted only during the years 1971 through 1974.

ticipants who were not deceased in the previous surveys.
The basic design of each NHEFS survey consisted of the fol-
lowing: (1) tracing subjects or their proxies to a current ad-
dress; (2) acquiring death certificates for deceased subjects;
(3)performingin-depthinterviewswiththesubjectsortheir
proxies for surviving subjects; and (4) obtaining hospital
andnursinghomerecords.Thepresentstudyisbasedonthe
follow-up through 1992.
The NHANES I sample included a total of 20729 per-
sons aged 25 to 74 years, 14407 (70%) of whom com-
pleted a medical examination and 11348 of whom (those
examined at survey locations 1-65) received dental exami-
nations. Persons who reported ever having a heart attack,
heart failure, stroke, or cancer at baseline (n=888) or with
missing data of study variables (n=498; unweighted mean
age, 52.03 years; 57.5% women) were then excluded, leav-
ing a final sample of 9962 persons for this study.
VARIABLES OF INTEREST
The outcome variables used in this analysis are incident and
fatal events of CVA that occurred during the follow-up
period of NHEFS. The International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 430 through 438 were
used for total CVA, ICD-9 433 through 434 and 436 through
438 for nonhemorrhagic stroke, and ICD-9 430 through 432
for hemorrhagic stroke. Incident cases of CVA met at least
1 of the following criteria: (1) a death certificate with cause
of death due to CVA or (2) one or more hospital/nursing
home stays during the follow-up period with discharge di-
agnosis of CVA. The date of incidence was defined as one of
the following: (1) date of the first hospital/nursing home ad-
missionwithadischargediagnosisofCVAor(2)dateofdeath
for CVA if there were no records of hospital/nursing home
stay for CVA.
The hospital/nursing home admission for CVA was as-
certained by the Health Care Facility Stay data collected at
each follow-up survey. During the interviews, respon-
dents were asked to report all overnight facility stays since
the baseline survey or prior interview. In addition to the
interviews, data on facility stays were gathered from the
death certificate or by tracing sources and other hospital
abstracts. All reported facilities were then contacted by mail
and asked to review the subject's medical records and ab-
stract information on exact dates of admission, discharge,
and diagnoses onto standard abstract forms. Discharge di-
agnoses were coded according to the ICD-9. The first dis-
charge diagnosis was used to define the cause of the cor-
responding admission.
Fatal events of CVA were ascertained based on the Trac-
ing and Mortality data from each follow-up survey. Infor-
mation was based on death certificates and includes vital
status, date last known alive, date of death, and underly-
ing causes of death coded according to the ICD-9.
Periodontal status measured at baseline is the expo-
sure variable of interest. The dental examiners in NHANES
I were carefully trained to follow a set of standards. The
standards/guidelines were used to help narrow the range
of examiner variability by eliminating many borderline or
questionable conditions that were frequently a source of
disagreement.15
Each individual tooth was assessed for the extent of
gingival inflammation, presence or absence of periodontal
pockets, and firmness of teeth in their sockets. Specifi-
cally, the criteria for assessing each tooth were the following:
· No periodontal disease--there was neither overt gingi-
val inflammation nor loss of function due to destruc-
tion of supporting tissues.
· Mild gingivitis--there was an overt area of inflamma-
tion in the free gingivae, but the area did not circum-
scribe the tooth.

weaker than those for periodontitis and did not reach
statistical significance except for fatal nonhemorrhagic
stroke. There was a slight difference in risk estimates
for the different outcome measurements, ie, RRs for
total CVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke associated with
periodontal disease tended to be larger for fatal events
than for incident events. The association between peri-
odontal status and risk for hemorrhagic stroke was not
significant.
Results of multivariate analyses stratified by race
and sex in whites are given in Table 4. For incident
CVA, an increased risk with periodontitis was sig-
nificant for African Americans and marginally signifi-
cant for white men and white women. For fatal CVA,
the association tended to be stronger. For incident
nonhemorrhagic stroke, a significant increased risk
with periodontitis was found in white men and white
women. Compared with incident nonhemorrhagic
stroke, point estimates of RR associated with peri-
odontal disease are much larger for fatal nonhemor-
rhagic stroke, especially in white men and African
Americans. For example, for white men, the RR (95%
CI) of fatal nonhemorrhagic stroke was 5.59 (1.60-
19.47) for gingivitis, 6.55 (2.19-19.62) for periodonti-
· Gingivitis--inflammation completely circumscribed the
tooth, but there was no apparent break in the epithelial
attachment.
· Gingivitis with pocket formation--the epithelial attach-
ment had been broken and there was a pocket, not merely
a deepened gingival crevice, due to swelling in the free
gingivae. There was no interference with normal masti-
catory function; the tooth was firm in its socket and had
not drifted.
· Advanced destruction with loss of masticatory function--
the tooth might be loose, have drifted, or sound dull on
percussion with a metallic instrument.
Based on the assessments of all individual teeth in the
mouth, periodontal status for each participant was grouped
into one of the following categories: (1) no periodontal dis-
ease (no teeth with periodontal disease, or not more than
1 tooth with mild gingivitis if 20 or more teeth were ex-
amined); (2) gingivitis (at least 1 tooth with mild ging-
ivitis or a worse condition that did not fit the category for
either no periodontal disease or periodontitis); (3) peri-
odontitis (4 or more teeth with overt pockets or worse con-
ditions); and (4) edentulousness (both arches edentulous
or all teeth were roots). The same definition for baseline
periodontal status was used in a previous study on the as-
sociation between periodontal status and the risk for coro-
nary heart disease.2
A number of baseline variables were used to control
for possible confounding. These variables included age, race,
sex, years of schooling, family income level (poverty in-
dex),16 smoking status, diabetes status, hypertension, al-
cohol use, serum total cholesterol levels, and body mass
index (BMI) (weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared). All covariates were ascertained at the base-
line survey; however, smoking information was collected
only for a subsample of the cohort at baseline (n=6913).
For the remaining persons (n=7502), smoking status at
baseline was derived from questions posed in the 1982
through 1984 follow-up interviews on lifetime smoking his-
tory or imputed history. The validity of this approach has
been documented.17,18
Self-reported medical histories of diabetes and hyper-
tension were ascertained by positive responses to the
questions "Has a doctor ever told you that you had any of
the following conditions? High blood pressure? Dia-
betes?" A yes to either condition was followed in turn by
the question "Do you still have it?" Self-reported fre-
quency of alcohol drinking during the past year at base-
line was coded as (1) none, (2) once per month, (3) 2 to 4
times per month, and (4) 2 to 6 times per week, and (5)
every day. The BMI was calculated from the weight and
height determined at the baseline survey. Serum total cho-
lesterol levels were measured in the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) Lipid Standardization
Laboratory using a semiautomated version of the Abell-
Kendall method.19
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, SDs of
the covariates, various levels of periodontal disease, and the
outcome events of interest were examined to show the char-
acteristics of the study sample. The time of follow-up was
determined as (1) the time interval between the date of medi-
cal examination at baseline and the date the event oc-
curred for a participant with an outcome event of interest
or (2) the time interval between the date of medical/dental
examination at baseline and the date last known alive for
a person without the outcome event. The CVA incidence
and mortality rates per 1000 person-years of follow-up were
calculated for participants with various levels of periodon-
tal status at baseline. Age-adjusted incidence or mortality
rate for each level of periodontal status was obtained by the
direct method using the total study sample as the stan-
dard population.20 Three age groups (25-44, 45-64, and
65-74 years) were used in calculation of the age-adjusted
rates.
Multivariate analyses were conducted using the Cox
proportional hazard model.20,21 In each model, the occur-
rence of the event to be examined was defined as a failure.
Participants who did not have the events of interest were
considered to be censored. For example, in the analysis of
CVA mortality, the failure was death due to CVA, and the
censor was still alive at last contact or death caused by some-
thing other than CVA. Hazard ratios from the Cox propor-
tional hazard models were used to estimate relative risks
(RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjust-
ment for all covariates of interest. In order to take NHANES
I design features into account, SUDAAN statistical soft-
ware22 and the weights for sample locations 1 through 65
were used in the analyses. Cox proportional hazard analy-
ses for total CVA, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and hemor-
rhagic stroke were performed for the sample as a whole.
The multivariate analyses for total CVA and nonhemor-
rhagic stroke were also performed separately for white men,
white women, and African Americans. Owing to limited
numbers of outcome events, analyses for hemorrhagic stroke
were not performed separately for the sex- or race-specific
groups.

COMMENTS
We found that periodontal disease was a significant
risk factor for CVA in this prospective study of a rep-
resentative sample of US adults. Specifically, periodon-
titis was associated with an increased risk for total
CVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke but not for hemor-
rhagic stroke. The finding of an increased risk for total
CVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke associated with peri-
odontitis was quite consistent for whites and African
Americans.
Our findings are consistent with several previous
studies.3,23,24 In a prospective study, Beck and col-
leagues3 found that periodontal bone loss was associ-
ated with an increased risk for stroke: 1147 participants
with periodontal assessments at baseline were followed
for an average of 18 years; RRs were 2.8 for stroke com-
paring periodontal bone loss with no bone loss after ad-
justing for a number of potential confounders.
In a case-control study, Syrjanen et al23 reported
poorer dental status in people with cerebral infarction
than in healthy controls. In 40 patients with cerebral in-
farction younger than 50 years and matched by age and
sex with 40 randomly selected community controls, those
with cerebral infarction had poorer periodontal status as
measured by gingival bleeding on probing, subgingival
calculus, suppuration in the gingival pocket, and an in-
dex reflecting periapical lesions, third-degree caries le-
sions, vertical bone pockets, and radiolucent lesions in
furcation areas.
In a more recent study, Grau et al24 investigated 166
patientswithcerebrovascularischemia,including130with
brain infarction and 36 with transient cerebral ische-
mia. The 166 patients were matched by age and sex with
166 hospital controls. Dental status was measured by a
total dental index that reflected caries, periapical le-
sions, periodontitis, and other dental lesions, and that
divided participants into 2 categories. Participants with
brain infarction and transient cerebral ischemia were ana-
lyzed together, and the odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.60
(1.18-5.70) for poor dental status compared with healthy
dental status. Further analyses indicated that the in-
creased risk for CVA was associated with periodontitis
and periapical lesions but not caries.
TheassociationbetweenperiodontaldiseaseandCVA
has several possible pathophysiologic links. Periodontitis
represents a systemic burden of bacteria, endotoxin, and
other bacterial products.25-27 Bacterial challenge could in-
duce an abundant production of proinflammatory cyto-

kines, cause inflammatory cell proliferation into large ar-
teries, and stimulate hepatic synthesis of clotting factors
(eg, fibrinogen), and thus contribute to atherogenesis and
thromboembolic events.1,3,28-31 In addition, several peri-
odontalpathogenscaninduceplateletaggregationandmay
thus be thrombogenic when entering the systemic circu-
lation as in periodontitis.32 Furthermore, bacterial lipo-
polysaccharides may attack arterial lining and damage the
endothelial cells.33,34 Periodontal bacteria have been found
in the atheromatous plaques of stroke sufferers.35 Peri-
odontal infection also can influence well-established car-
diovascular risk factors such as lipids, fibrinogen, and C-
reactive protein modifying those factors toward a profile
that is more atherogenic.36 The association between peri-
odontitis and an increased risk for nonhemorrhagic stroke
found in this study may well fit with the hypothesized
pathophysiologic links.
The present study has several strengths. First, it is
based on a sample that represents the US adult popula-
tion; thus, it has good external validity compared with
other studies in which study samples were restricted to
local populations or clinical settings. As such, its rel-
evant public health impact at the national level can be
estimated directly.
Second, the association between periodontal status
and the risk for CVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke has been
addressed for white women and for African Americans
in this study. As found in white men, periodontal dis-
ease may also be an important risk factor for total CVA
and, in particular, nonhemorrhagic stroke in these sub-
groups.
The prospective feature of the study has secured
the temporal sequence of a possible association. That
is, cerebrovascular events ought to occur subsequent
to the presence of periodontal disease, as the conse-
quences of periodontal infection. The periodontal
assessments in this study were performed before the
occurrence of the outcome event, and thus, there
should be little if any bias in the assessment of peri-
odontal health that related to the outcome measure-
ments. Selection bias should also have been low
because of the high rate of follow-up.
Statistical analyses were performed with adjust-
ment for a number of potential confounders. The de-
sign features by which the data were collected were also
taken into account. Demographic variables such as age,
sex, educational level, income, and well-established car-

diovascular risk factors such as cigarette smoking, dia-
betes status, BMI, and serum total cholesterol level were
included in the analyses to control for possible confound-
ing. The design features such as stratification and clus-
tering in collecting data were adjusted for using proper
statistical techniques. These techniques helped to re-
duce bias in generating national estimates.
This study has several limitations. Periodontal sta-
tus was assessed according to a standardized protocol,
but the assessments were quite crude compared with as-
sessments used in more recent studies such as NHANES
III. Misclassification of periodontal disease status is there-
fore likely in the present study, though it is likely to be
nondifferential, since the outcome events occurred af-
ter periodontal status was already determined. Nondif-
ferential misclassification usually dilutes the estimate of
an association. As such, this study is likely to underes-
timate the association between periodontal status and the
risk for CVA, although overestimation is not com-
pletely impossible.
Causal microorganisms per se were not measured
in this study. Although periodontal disease (as defined
in this study) might reflect the exposure to harmful mi-
croorganisms, the underlying cause for periodontal dis-
ease, and the presumed causal factor linking periodon-
tal disease to CVA, we were not able to sufficiently test
the role of specific microorganisms in this study. Thus,
although we found an association between poor peri-
odontal status and elevated risk for CVA, further stud-
ies are needed to confirm the possible role of specific
harmful microorganisms in this association.
Periodontal status was measured only at the base-
line survey. Changes in periodontal status over
follow-up are not taken into account. It is expected that
those who had no periodontal disease at one time might
develop the disease later. Thus, the nondisease group,
the referents, might include those who developed peri-
odontal disease during the follow-up period. In addition,
the periodontal disease status, especially acute periodon-
tal inflammation, for those who already had the disease
might progress during the course of follow-up, or recess
if properly treated. Since there are no available data to
measure change in periodontal status over time, the
observed association between periodontal status and
CVA might be biased, possibly in the direction toward
the null.
Periodontal status is associated with socioeco-
nomic status and health-risk lifestyle or behaviors. These
factors may influence cerebrovascular risk through mecha-
nisms in which periodontal status is not involved, thereby
confounding the observed association between periodon-
tal status and the risk for CVA if not properly adjusted
for in the analysis. In this study, a number of variables
including educational level, family income, alcohol and
tobacco use, and BMI were adjusted for using multivar-
iate analyses. The analyses also indicate that the relative
risk of CVA tends to be higher for periodontitis than for
edentulousness, which supports the hypothesis of peri-
odontal pathogens as possible causes for the associa-
tion. However, unknown factors not included in the analy-
sis are still potential confounders in the observed
association.
Cerebrovascular events were determined according
to medical records or death certificates. The first step in
collecting information from medical records was the
participants' recall of medical service use, and if partici-
pants with periodontal disease were less likely to use
medical service, their incident CVAs would be more
likely to be missed. Thus, the effect of periodontal dis-
ease would be underestimated. This may explain why
the association between periodontal status and fatal
events of total CVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke were
stronger than that between periodontal status and the
incident events.
In conclusion, this prospective study suggests
that periodontitis is significantly associated with risk
of developing CVA and, in particular, nonhemorrhagic
stroke. While a conclusive statement about cause-
effect relationship cannot be made at this time, the
consistency of the findings in different racial groups
and the strength of the association warrant further
examination of the potentially important association
between 2 chronic conditions highly prevalent in the
adult population.
