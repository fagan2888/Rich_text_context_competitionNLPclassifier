PHYSICIANS' OPPORTUNITIES TO
address adolescents' health
needs depend on adolescents at
risk of health problems seek-
ing care. Health care for emotional
problems, substance use, and risk-
associated sexual behaviors is particu-
larly important since major causes of
adolescent morbidity and mortality are
related to motor vehicle injuries, inter-
personal violence, suicide, alcohol and
tobacco use, and sexual behaviors.1,2
Physicians have opportunities to screen
adolescents for behaviors associated
with potential negative health out-
comes and for health problems during
routine health care3 and visits precipi-
tated by adolescents' concerns. Both de-
pend on adolescents having access to
and using health care services.

Within the context of research on
health care utilization, there has been
relatively little focus on foregone health
care. This may be an important omis-
sion when trying to understand health
care utilization during adolescence. We
know that adolescents' decisions about
seeking health care are complex, par-
ticularly for the types of sensitive health
issues linked to adolescent morbidity
and mortality, and that factors influ-
encing care-seeking are in part related
to unique developmental issues. For ex-
ample, adolescents report that con-

Context No annual national population estimates exist of the numbers of adolescents
who think they need but do not receive health care or their risk of health problems.
Objective To describe the proportion of adolescents who report foregone health care
each year and the influence of sociodemographic factors, insurance status, past health
care, and health risks/behaviors on foregone care.
Design Cross-sectional analyses of data from wave 1 of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health, conducted during 1995.
Setting In-home interviews conducted throughout the United States.
Participants Of 27 000 adolescents in grades 7 through 12 who were invited to par-
ticipate, 20 746 (76.8%) completed the in-home interview.
Main Outcome Measure Reported foregone health care in the preceding year by
individual and family characteristics, insurance status, past health care, health/
behavior risk factors, and symptoms.
Results On average, 2268 (18.7%) of 12 079 adolescents reported foregone health
care within the past year. Factors associated with decreased risk of foregone care in-
cluded continuous private or public insurance (adjusted relative risk [95% confidence
interval], 0.64 [0.50-0.82] to 0.82 [0.70-0.96]), and having a physical examination
within the past year (0.87 [0.78-0.97] for male and 0.79 [0.70-0.88] for female
adolescents). Factors associated with increased risk of foregone care included older
age (1.12 [1.06-1.15] for male), minority race/ethnicity (1.25 [1.06-1.46] to 1.50 [1.30-
1.73]), single-parent home (1.31 [1.18-1.46] for female), and disability (2.03 [1.61-
2.52] for male and 1.66 [1.20-2.10] for female). Adolescents participating in the fol-
lowing behaviors were more likely to report foregone care than those who did not:
daily cigarette use (26.0% vs 16.8%; 1.34 [1.16-1.55]), frequent alcohol use (30.3%
vs 18.1%; 1.34 [1.11-1.62] for male), and sexual intercourse (25.1% vs 15.1%; 1.23
[1.09-1.39] for male and 1.39 [1.23-1.56] for female). From 32.4% to 38.2% of ado-
lescents with symptoms suggesting health problems reported foregone care (1.61 [1.13-
2.26] to 2.03 [1.81-2.28]).
Conclusions Our study suggests that adolescents who forego care are at increased
risk of physical and mental health problems. Efforts to improve adolescent health through
health care should address factors influencing foregone care.

cerns about privacy influence their will-
ingness to seek health care and, in
contrast to adults' concerns about pri-
vacy, adolescents worry about disclo-
sure of sensitive health information to
their parents.16-19 A recent survey found
that among adolescents who report a
history of not getting needed health
care, the leading reason was that they
did not want their parents to know, fol-
lowed by financial or insurance rea-
sons.20,21 In addition, despite emerg-
ing biological maturity, adolescents may
lack the cognitive or psychosocial
maturity to effectively use health care
systems during a time when they are
developing increased autonomy.22
To determine the potential impor-
tance of foregone health care among
adolescents, several gaps in our knowl-
edge need to be addressed. First, the
number of adolescents who forego
health care on an annual basis is not
known. Most national population es-
timates of unmet health needs among
adolescents have been limited by reli-
ance on data from parents or other adult
family members9-14 who may not be
fully aware of adolescents' health needs
or decisions to forego health care for
sensitive health issues.23 Previous stud-
ies that have directly asked adoles-
cents about unmet health needs have
been regional studies and/or limited by
use of measures for foregone care that
do not specify a time interval.18-21,24 Sec-
ond, we do not know if adolescents who
forego care are the "worried well" or at
risk of real health problems. Third,
comparisons between factors that are
associatedwithforegonehealthcareand
general health care utilization among
adolescents have not been performed.
Iffactorspredictingforegonehealthcare
are substantially different than factors
predicting general health care utiliza-
tion, then policies aimed solely at im-
proving general utilization among ado-
lescents may not effectively reduce
foregone care.
The National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health) pro-
vides opportunities to begin to ad-
dress these gaps in our existing knowl-
edge.25 The main objectives of this study
are to define a national population es-
timate of annual foregone health care
among adolescents, their risk of health
problems, and reasons for foregone
care. In addition, this study describes
the influence of sociodemographic fac-
tors, family characteristics, insurance
status, previous health care, behaviors
with risk of negative health outcomes,
and symptoms suggestive of serious
physical or mental health problems on
adolescents' report of foregone health
care within the past year and makes
comparisons between factors influenc-
ing foregone care vs having a physical
examination in the past year.
METHODS
Study Population
All procedures for Add Health were ap-
proved by the University of North Caro-
lina Institutional Review Board on Re-
search Involving Human Subjects.
A stratified nationally representative
sample of all public and private high
schools in the United States was drawn
fromtheQualityEducationDatabasein
April 1994. Schools were selected with
probability proportional to size across
broad strata based on region, urbanic-
ity, school type (public, private, and
parochial), and racial composition. For
each of the 80 primary sampling strata,
a school or school pair spanning grades
7 through 12 was recruited to partici-
pate in the study. Seventy percent of the
originallyselectedschoolsagreedtopar-
ticipate. Replacement schools were
recruited within each community. In
total, 79% of all schools contacted par-
ticipated in the study.
Throughout the fall of 1994, school
questionnaires were administered to all
students attending participating
schools; 77% of students enrolled at the
start of the school year participated in
the study, including approximately
4000 students who were not on ear-
lier school rosters but who were at-
tending school in the fall. In total,
90 118 in-school questionnaires were
completed. From the students who
completed an in-school question-
naire, 27 000 individuals were se-
lected for a 90-minute in-home inter-
view. Approximately 220 students were
selected from each school pair, irre-
spective of size, to form a main core
sample of approximately 17 600
(80  220). In addition to individuals
selected for the main sample, special
oversamples of race/ethnic groups, dis-
abled youth, and individuals eligible for
participation in a behavior-genetic
sample were selected for in-home in-
terviews.
Wave 1 in-home interviews were
conducted during 1995. Of the 27 000
adolescents invited to participate in the
in-home interview, 20 746 (76.8%)
completed the interview. Of those com-
pleting the interview, 12 102 repre-
sented the main core sample, and the
remainderrepresentedadolescentsfrom
oversampled subgroups (TABLE 1). The
sample for this study consists of all ado-
lescents who completed the wave 1 in-
home Add Health interview.
Interview Procedures
After obtaining written parental con-
sent and adolescent assent, adolescent
in-home interviews were conducted us-
ing Computer-Assisted Personal Inter-
view and Audio Computer-Assisted
Self-Interviewing technology.26 Ado-
lescents listened to all potentially sen-
sitive questions through earphones and
directly entered their responses into a
laptop computer, thereby minimizing
potential for interviewer or parental ef-
fects on their responses. In addition, 1
parent in each household completed a
written questionnaire that included
questions about the adolescents' insur-
ance status.

Past Health Care. Responses to
"When did you last have a physical
exam by a doctor or nurse?" were di-

1 or more years ago.
Health/Behavior Risk Factors.
Heightandweightweremeasuredatthe
time of interview, from which body
mass index (BMI) was calculated
(weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared). Participants were
considered overweight if their BMI was
greater than or equal to 2 SDs above the
sample mean (31.4 kg/m2 for male and
30.9 kg/m2 for female participants) and
underweight if their BMI was less than
orequalto2SDsbelowthesamplemean
(13.6 kg/m2 for male and 13.5 kg/m2 for
female participants). Level of sports
activity was measured by response to
"Duringthepastweek,howmanytimes
did you play an active sport, such as
baseball, softball, basketball, soccer,
swimming or football?" with responses
ranging from 0 to 5 or more times per
week. Presence of disability was mea-
sured by response to "Do you have dif-
ficulty using your hands, arms, legs, or
feet because of a permanent physical
condition?" Participants who reported
ever smoking at least 1 cigarette every
day for 30 days were considered to have
a history of regular smoking. Partici-
pants who reported "getting drunk or
very, very high on alcohol" at least 1
dayaweekoverthepast12monthswere
considered frequent alcohol users. Par-
ticipants who responded affirmatively
to "Have you ever had sexual inter-
course? When we say sexual inter-
course, we mean when a male inserts
his penis into a female's vagina" were
considered sexually active.
Symptoms Suggesting Health Prob-
lems. Participants were asked about
symptoms over the preceding 12
months. Those who reported 1 or more
of the following symptoms almost ev-
ery day or every day were considered
to be at high risk of serious mental or
physical health problems: headache, a
stomachache or upset stomach, cold
sweats, feel physically weak for no rea-
son, sore throat or cough, feeling re-
ally sick, dizziness, or chest pain. Par-
ticipants who reported crying almost
every day or every day were consid-
ered to be at high risk of mental health
problems. Participants who reported
painful or very frequent urination (dys-

Measure of Dependent Variable
Foregone health care was measured by
response to "Has there been any time
overthepastyearwhenyouthoughtyou
should get medical care, but did not?"
Statistical Analyses
Data were prepared using SAS Version
6.12 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary,
NC) and statistical analyses were per-
formed using STATA Release 5.0 soft-
ware(StataCorp,CollegeStation,Tex).
Descriptivestatisticswerecomputedfor
the core sample weighted to correct for
the stratified sampling design, yielding
estimates that are representative of the
national adolescent population. Multi-
variate analyses were performed using
a theoretically derived model con-
structed from variables hypothesized to
influence foregone health care because
of their association with health care uti-
lization in existing literature. Risk fac-
tors for health problems were selected
to represent common health-protec-
tiveandhealth-compromisingdomains
in this age group. Because of interac-
tions between sex and several indepen-
dent variables (eg, level of sports activi-
ties, frequency of crying, frequency of
painful urination), multivariate analy-
seswereperformedseparatelyformales

lems were approximately twice as likely
to report foregone care as adolescents
in the comparison groups.
Multivariate analyses showed that the
associations of age, race/ethnicity, fam-
ily composition, insurance status, past
examination, disability, risk factors/
behaviors, and symptoms suggestive of
serious mental or physical health prob-
lems with foregone health care per-
sisted while controlling for all other fac-
tors (TABLE 3). The only significant
association found in bivariate analy-
ses that did not remain significant in
multivariate analyses was the relation-
ship between family SES and foregone
care.
Reasons for Foregone Health Care
Among the 2351 participants who re-
ported foregone care, the most fre-
quently reported reason was "thought
the problem would go away" (63.3%)
(TABLE 4). Other reasons for foregone
care were fear of what the physician
would say or do (15.5%), inability to
pay (14.0%), concerns about confiden-
tiality (11.5%), parent/guardian would
not go with participant for care (11.7%),
and difficulty making an appointment
(8.9%).
Multivariate analyses were per-
formedtoassesstheassociationofsocio-

ilyfactors,insurancestatus,healthrisks/
behaviors, and symptoms with reasons
for foregone health care among adoles-
cents who reported foregone care. Rea-
sons for foregone care were coded as
either nonaccess or access issues.
Responses of didn't want parents to
know, afraid of what the doctor would
say or do, and thought the problem
would go away were coded as nonac-
cess issues because they imply ambiva-
lence about seeking health care.

Comparing Factors Influencing
Having a Physical Examination vs
Foregone Care in Past Year
On average, an estimated 66.9% of ado-
lescents reported having had a physi-
cal examination within the previous 12
months. Adolescents who were white
or African American, with higher ver-
bal skills, with higher SES families, or
with insurance were more likely to re-
port having a physical examination than
comparison groups (Table 1). Adoles-
cents who reported high levels of sports
activities were more likely to report an
examination compared with those with
low sports activities (76.1% vs 63.8%),
and infrequent or nonsmokers were
more likely to report an examination
than adolescents with a history of regu-
lar cigarette use (67.9% vs 63.8%)
(Table 2).
Comparison of factors that were
shown by multivariate analyses to have
independent effects on having had an
examination and reported foregone care
show that insurance influences both
outcome variables in the expected di-
rection; insured adolescents were more
likely to report an examination and
were at decreased risk of foregone care
(Table 3). However, insurance status
was the only individual or family fac-
tor found with this pattern. Age, race/
ethnicity, and presence of 1 vs 2 par-
ents in the home were not associated
with having an examination but were
associated with foregone care. Socio-
economic status continued to be asso-
ciated with having an examination but
not foregone care. The presence of
health risks/behaviors or symptoms
concerning health problems had vary-
ing associations with having an exami-
nation and foregoing care and not al-
ways in the expected pattern. For
example, sexually active adolescents
were both more likely to report hav-
ing had an examination and more likely
to report foregone care than those who
were nonsexually active.
This study was not designed to as-
sess the influence of source of usual care
on having an examination or foregone
care. However, since participants who
reported an examination in the past year

COMMENT
Ourfindingssuggestthateveryyear1of
5 adolescents feel that they should get
healthcarebutdonot.Theseadolescents
are at increased risk of real health prob-
lems.Manyadolescentswhoforegohealth

needs.Ifhealthcareprofessionalsareto
addressmajorcausesofadolescentmor-
bidityandmortality,strategiesareneeded
to decrease foregone care.
The risk for foregone care is clearly
diminishedwhenadolescentshavecon-
tinuous private or public health insur-
ance. Independent of insurance status
and in contrast to factors influencing
having an examination in the past year,
older male adolescents, minority ado-
lescents, female adolescents who live in
single-parent homes, disabled youth,
and adolescents participating in risk-
associated behaviors or experiencing
symptoms suggesting serious health
problems are at increased risk for fore-
gone care. This supports the conclu-
sions of others that insurance is impor-
tant but not alone sufficient to ensure
use of health care services.32-34 In
Canada, where there is universal health
insurance, from 40% to 60% of adoles-
centswhoareworriedaboutissuessuch
as emotional problems, birth control,
alcohol use, or sexually transmitted
infections have not consulted a physi-
cian or nurse even though they would
like to.35 Together these findings con-
firm that factors influencing adoles-
cents to forego health care are com-
plex and suggest that some are distinct
from factors influencing general use of
health care services.
Reasonsthatadolescentsforegohealth
care need to be viewed within a devel-
opmental context. Among adolescents
who forego care, 15% report that this is
in part because a parent or guardian will
not go or no one is available to go with
them, and 12% report that it is partly be-
cause they do not want their parents to
know. This reflects the developmental
complexities of parent-child relation-
ships during adolescence. On one hand,
many adolescents want parents to be in-
volved in health care, depend on par-
ents for transportation, and need their
parents'consenttoobtainhealthcare.On
the other hand, some adolescents have
important health issues that they want
to keep private16-21 and certain types of
medical care can be provided without
parents' consent.36 All adolescents have
thedevelopmentaltaskoflearningtobe-
come responsible for their own health
and health care and developing a pri-
vate relationship with their physician as
theyapproachadulthood.Difficultiesne-
gotiating the health care system may in
part be due to adolescents' relative in-
experience as consumers of health care.
Strategies to reduce foregone health
care among adolescents must con-
sider these developmental issues. Pro-
fessional organizations support increas-
ing adolescents' access to health services
in general and confidential health ser-
vices when needed, because of con-
cerns about adolescents' unmet health
care needs.37-39 Approaches that have
been suggested to increase adoles-
cents' access to health care include in-
creasing the availability of conve-
nient, affordable, and developmentally
appropriate health services. This in-
cludes ensuring that private, confiden-
tial health services are available for sen-
sitivehealthissues,therebyencouraging
adolescents to seek and receive needed
health care for concerns related to sub-
stance use, sexual behaviors, and men-
tal health. Our results suggest that these
strategies have the potential to in-
crease clinicians' opportunities to ad-
dress issues related to major causes of
adolescent morbidity and mortality by
decreasing the numbers of adoles-
cents who forego health care.
Several potential limitations of this
study should be noted. Self-report data
hasinherentlimitations;however,ado-
lescent reports of their own health care
behaviors are probably at least as accu-
rateasadultreportsofadolescenthealth
carebehaviorsandprobablymoreaccu-
rateinregardtoforegonecare.Measures
for symptoms associated with risk of
health problems were oriented toward
chronicconditionsratherthanacutecon-
ditions. The reliability of our measure
forforegonecareisunknown,andhealth
concerns associated with specific epi-
sodesofforegonecarewerenotassessed.
However, concerns associated with a
singleepisodeofforegonecaremightnot

lescents;ifadepressedadolescentfore-
goes care for a minor illness, an oppor-
tunitytodiagnosedepressionismissed.
Finally, this study used a school-based
design and the results may not apply to
out-of-school youth.
Despite these potential limitations,
our findings highlight the importance
of a comprehensive approach to in-
creasing adolescents' use of health care
services. The newly enacted State Chil-
dren's Health Insurance Programs rep-
resent an important step toward achiev-
ing the goal of continuous insurance for
all adolescents. However, insurance
alone does not ensure that adoles-
cents will receive needed health care.
Adolescents who choose to forego
health care are of particular concern be-
cause they appear to be at dispropor-
tionately high risk of having health
problems. Factors that influence ado-
lescents to forego care must be consid-
ered when designing systems to ad-
dress adolescents' unique health needs.
