Abstract
Aim: To investigate the role of body mass index (BMI) and weight in the long-term efficacy of
etanercept in patients with psoriasis.
Methods: Medical records were retrospectively analysed. Extracted data included weight, BMI,
comorbidities and psoriasis area severity index (PASI). Patients were stratified by weight (<80 kg
or !80 kg) and BMI (healthy, BMI 22 ­ 24.99 kg/m2; overweight, BMI 25 ­ 29.99 kg/m2; obese, BMI
!30 kg/m2).
Results: The study included 66 patients. Body weight had no effect on etanercept efficacy. There
was a significant reduction in etanercept efficacy in obese patients (n ¼ 12) compared with healthy
weight (n ¼ 33) or overweight (n ¼ 21) patients.
Conclusion: Obesity has a negative effect on the efficacy of etanercept in psoriasis.

Introduction
The relationship between body mass index
(BMI) and treatment with anti-tumour
necrosis factor (TNF)-a agents (including
etanercept) is unclear. Studies have found
significant weight gain in patients with
psoriasis treated with various anti-TNF-a
therapies,1­3 but neither BMI nor weight
gain were associated with clinical inefficacy.

Female, overweight or obese patients with
axial spondyloarthritis have been found to
have a lower response rate to anti-TNF-a
drugs compared with male or healthy weight
patients.4 We have shown that being female
and having coexisting psoriatic arthritis
were associated with increased risk of pri-
mary inefficacy to etanercept.5 The aim of
the present study was to investigate the role
of BMI and body weight in the long-term
efficacy of etanercept in the treatment of
psoriasis.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective database analysis
included consecutive patients with psoriasis
referred to the Department of Dermatology,
University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome,
Italy, between 30 January 2014 and 30
January 2015. Patients were required to
have BMI > 22 kg/m2 and to have under-
gone etanercept treatment for ! 4 years. A
single investigator (A.G.) with no access to
the patients analysed all data using anon-
ymised database registries.
Patients were stratified according to body
weight (<80 kg or !80 kg) and BMI
(healthy, BMI 22 ­ 24.99 kg/m2; overweight,
BMI 25 ­ 29.99 kg/m2; obese, BMI ! 30 kg/
m2). Clinical efficacy was defined as a reduc-
tion in mean psoriasis area severity index
(PASI) during treatment. Patients provided
written informed consent prior to treatment.
Ethical approval was not required due to the
retrospective nature of the study.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or n
of patients, and compared using last-obser-
vation-carried-forward (LOCF) analysis
with Statistics software, version W1.59
(Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford,
UK). A two-tailed P-value < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
The medical records of 300 consecutive
patients were evaluated, 66 of whom fulfilled
the inclusion criteria. The demographic and
clinical characteristics of these 66 patients
are shown in Table 1. There were no

statistically significant changes in body
weight during etanercept treatment.
Table 2 shows data regarding psoriasis
severity and comorbidities in patients stra-
tified by body weight. There was no signifi-
cant between group differences in PASI.
Diabetes was significantly more common in
patients weighing ! 80 kg than those weigh-
ing < 80 kg (P < 0.05).
Data regarding PASI and comorbidities
in patients stratified according to BMI are
shown in Table 3. After treatment with
etanercept for 48 weeks, PASI scores were
significantly higher in obese patients than
healthy weight or overweight patients
(P < 0.001 for each comparison). Type II
diabetes was significantly more common in
obese patients than healthy weight or over-
weight patients (P < 0.01 for each
comparison).
Discussion
In contrast to the findings of others,1­3 our
data indicate that obesity (BMI ! 30 kg/m2)
has a negative effect on the efficacy of
etanercept for treatment of psoriasis. A
high BMI has been shown to be a potential
predictor of anti-TNF-a drug discontinu-
ation.6 The literature regarding the effect of
weight/BMI on efficacy is limited: one study
had an inadequate sample size,3 others had a
short duration (24 weeks),2,7 and another
stratified patients into two groups only
(using BMI 25 kg/m2).1 Furthermore, the
majority of studies have focused on body

differences between published studies and
our experience.
In conclusion, obesity is associated with
decreased efficacy of etanercept in psoriasis.
Additional, larger scale studies are required
to confirm our findings.
