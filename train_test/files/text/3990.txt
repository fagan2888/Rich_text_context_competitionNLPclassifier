Abstract
Background and Aim: A pre-specified country analysis of subjects from the Philippines in the CHInese Medicine
NeuroAiD Efficacy on Stroke recovery (CHIMES) Study showed significantly improved functional and neurological out-
comes on MLC601 at month (M) 3. We aimed to assess these effects on long-term functional recovery in the Filipino
cohort.
Methods: The CHIMES-E (extension) Study evaluated subjects who completed three months of randomized placebo-
controlled treatment in CHIMES up to two years. Blinding of treatment allocation was maintained and all subjects
received standard stroke care and rehabilitation. Modified Rankin Score (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI) were assessed
in-person at M3 and by telephone at M6, M12, M18, M24. Odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for functional recovery using ordinal analysis of mRS and for achieving functional independence (mRS 0-1 or BI ! 95)
at each time point were calculated, adjusting for age, sex, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS),
onset-to-treatment time (OTT) and pre-stroke mRS.
Results: The 378 subjects (MLC601 192, placebo 186) included in CHIMES-E from the Philippines (mean age
60.2 Æ 11.1) had more women (p < 0.001), worse baseline NIHSS (p < 0.001) and longer onset to treatment time
(p ¼ 0.002) compared to other countries. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. The treat-
ment effect of MLC601 seen at M3 peaked at M6 with OR for mRS shift of 1.53 (95% CI 1.05­2.22), mRS dichotomy 0­1
of 1.77 (95% CI 1.10­2.83), and BI ! 95 of 1.87 (95% CI 1.16­3.02). The beneficial effect persisted up to M24.
Conclusion: The beneficial effect of MLC601 seen at M3 in the Filipino cohort is durable up to two years after stroke.

acute ischemic stroke of intermediate severity in the
preceding 72 h.1 Almost half (n ¼ 504) of the subjects
were included from the Philippines. Hence, a pre-
specified country analysis of subjects from the
Philippines was performed which showed a statistically
significant improvement in functional and neurological
outcomes with MLC601 at month (M) 3.2 The demon-
stration of a larger treatment effect in the Filipino
cohort was attributed to inclusion of more patients
with poorer prognosis as compared to other countries.
Subsequently, an extension study of CHIMES
(CHIMES-E) wherein subjects were followed up
blinded to original treatment allocation for up to two
years after a stroke, showed MLC601 to be associated
with significantly increased odds of attaining functional
independence at 6, 12 and 18 months.3
In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of a
three-month treatment course of MLC601 on long-
term functional recovery in the Filipino cohort during
the 21 months of additional follow-up.
Methods
All subjects in CHIMES were eligible for CHIMES-E
unless they withdrew consent. The subjects did not
receive any further trial medication after the initial
three months but had standard stroke care and rehabili-
tation as prescribed by the treating physician. Modified
Rankin Score (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI) were
assessed in-person at M3 (CHIMES) and by telephone
at M6, M12, M18, M24 (CHIMES-E).3 Treatment
effect was estimated by calculating the odds ratios
(OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for functional recovery (mRS ordinal analysis)
and for achieving functional independence (mRS 0­1
versus > 1 or BI ! 95 versus < 95 dichotomy analyses)

at each time point adjusting for age, sex, baseline
National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS),
stroke onset-to-treatment time (OTT) and pre-stroke
mRS. For subjects whose mRS scores were not avail-
able at M3 and M24, the scores were imputed by the
last observation carried forward (LOCF) method from
M1 and M18, respectively. Data without LOCF were
also analyzed and further sensitivity analyses were per-
formed by assigning all missing data the worst outcome
(mRS 6) and the best outcome (mRS 0) at each time
point. The long-term safety of the initial treatment with
MLC601 was assessed by the occurrence of any new
medical condition and death.
Results
A total of 504 subjects were randomized from the
Philippines in the CHIMES study among whom 378
(75%) had long-term follow-up information in
CHIMES-E (Figure 1). There was no difference in
baseline demographics, NIHSS, pre-stroke mRS,
OTT, and risk factor profiles between Filipino subjects

who did or did not have data available at final fol-
low-up, indicating that a bias in follow-up was unli-
kely (Table 1). Moreover, baseline characteristics were
similar between the MLC601- and placebo-treated
groups. As compared to other countries, however,
there were more women, (p < 0.001), worse baseline
NIHSS scores (p < 0.001), and longer OTT
(p ¼ 0.002) from the Philippines compared to those
included from other countries (Table 2). The risk
factor profile of subjects from the Philippines
was also different compared to those from other
countries.
Twenty subjects died by M3, 26 by M6, 27 by M12,
28 by M16, and 30 by M24. LOCF mRS data were
imputed from M1 to M3 in 21 subjects and from
M18 to M24 in 8 subjects (Figure 1). The ORs for
mRS and BI in favor of MLC601 were maximal at
M6 with ORs of 1.53 (95% CI 1.05­2.22) for mRS
ordinal analysis, 1.77 (95% CI 1.10­2.83) for mRS
dichotomy 0­1, and 1.87 (95% CI 1.16­3.03) for
BI ! 95 (Figure 2). The benefits persisted until M24.
Results did not change when data were analyzed with-
out LOCF. Sensitivity analyses assuming worst and
best outcomes for missing data showed qualitatively
similar trajectories for all time points with the expected
variabilities in 95% CI (Figure 2). By comparison,
although still in favor of MLC601, the effect sizes
among non-Filipino subjects at different time points
were not of the same magnitude as those of the
Filipino cohort as illustrated in Figure 3.
During the study period up to M24, two recurrent
strokes and 16 deaths (including 7 classified as vascular
death) were reported in the MLC601 group and one
recurrent stroke and 14 deaths (including 4 classified
as vascular death) in the placebo group. Rates of occur-
rence of other illnesses were overall low in both treat-
ment groups (Table 3) and did not reach statistical
significance.
Discussion
Our study shows the durability of the beneficial effect in
the Filipino cohort of MLC601 on post-stroke recovery
for up to 2 years after stroke onset despite only three
months of treatment. The results were consistent
between the outcome assessments used, i.e. mRS and

BI and at all time points up to 24 months after stroke.
The relatively larger and more durable effects of
MLC601 seen in the Filipino cohort as compared to
that seen in the overall population in the CHIMES-E
study and in subjects from non-Filipino sites are likely
due to the difference in the characteristics of subjects
recruited. We have previously demonstrated that sub-
jects having more prognostic factors for poor outcome
showed better treatment effects with MLC601 at three
months.4,5 Patients in CHIMES had relatively mild
stroke severity many of whom recovered well by three
months even in the placebo group,1 which likely
affected the power of detecting the treatment effect.6­8
The study population from the Philippines, on the
other hand, included more subjects with prognostic fac-
tors for poorer outcome, such as female sex, stroke
severity, and treatment delay.
The durability of the benefits derived from treatment
with MLC601 is clinically important. Spontaneous
recovery to a certain extent in the initial three months
after stroke is well described, especially among strokes
of milder severity.9 Thereafter, neurological and func-
tional recovery occurs at a much slower rate. However,
a recent study from the Swedish Stroke Register
showed a high proportion of patients transitioning
from independence at three months to dependence in
activities of daily living at 12 months after a stroke.10
This deterioration was more common in older patients
and women. While demonstrating benefit at three
months would already translate to improved quality
of lives of patients and caregivers, a durable benefit of
up to two years would translate to significantly higher
quality-adjusted life years. MLC601 has been shown to
have neuro-restorative properties, in addition to its
neuroprotective properties, in various animal and cel-
lular stroke models by enhancing the natural neuro-
repair processes of the brain after an injury.11,12 The
gradual but long-lasting beneficial effects of such treat-
ment strategy can, therefore, be expected in strokes of
any severity, but logically can clinically be demon-
strated better in patients with worse prognosis among
whom improvements are likely to be more apparent
with treatment.
There are some limitations in this study. Variables
such as quality of medical care, nutrition, and economic
factors were not collected which could have allowed us
to assess their potential as confounders. There were no
data on the use of medications such as anti-thrombo-
tics, statins, and anti-hypertensives that could have
affected recurrent vascular events.
The main strength of the study, nonetheless, is the
long duration of follow-up of subjects randomized in
an international multi-centre clinical trial with double-
blinding of treatment allocation being maintained till
the end of the study period. The end-points used were
those employed in most stroke outcome trials.
Performing the functional assessments by telephone
ensured subject retention and minimized the loss of
data in our study. They have been shown to be as reli-
able as face-to-face evaluations.13,14
Conclusion
To conclude, the Filipino cohort in the CHIMES and
CHIMES-E study had different prognostic and vascular
risk factor profiles as compared to other countries. The
larger and more durable beneficial effects with MLC601
observed in the Filipino population are most likely due
to the presence of prognostic factors for poorer out-
come. This study supports our hypothesis that treatment
effects are seen earlier and are sustained in stroke
patients who have the potential to benefit from treat-
ment. A longer follow-up study design is preferred in
assessing the efficacy of treatment in post-stroke recov-
ery trials. Our data further support the rationale for
selecting subjects with potentially poorer outcomes in
stroke recovery trials to improve the ability of the
study to detect meaningful treatment effects.
