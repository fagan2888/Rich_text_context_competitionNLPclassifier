OBJECTIVE -- To determine the prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype among U.S.
adolescents using the most recent national data and to examine trends in metabolic syndrome
prevalence.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Analysis of data on 991 adolescents (aged
12­19 years) who had fasted for at least 6 h, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES 1999­2000). The metabolic syndrome was determined using the National
Cholesterol Education Program (Adult Treatment Panel III) definition modified for age.
RESULTS -- The overall prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype among U.S. adoles-
cents increased from 4.2% in NHANES III (1988­1992) to 6.4% in NHANES 1999­2000 (P 
0.001). The syndrome was more prevalent (P  0.01) in male than female adolescents (9.1 vs.
3.7%) and was found in 32.1% of overweight adolescents (BMI 95th percentile for age and
sex), compared with 7.1% of adolescents at risk for overweight (BMI between 85th and 95th
percentiles) (P  0.001). Based on population-weighted estimates, 2 million U.S. adolescents
currently have a metabolic syndrome phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS -- The prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype has increased sig-
nificantly over the past decade among U.S. adolescents and is particularly prevalent (30%) in
overweight adolescents. These findings have important implications for public health because of
the well-known health risks associated with the metabolic syndrome in adults.

An association between obesity, high
fasting triglycerides, elevated fast-
ing plasma insulin, impaired glu-
cose tolerance, hypertension, and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been
recognized since the early 1960s. These
major risk factors tend to cluster together
in many individuals, suggesting a com-
mon etiology, which has been variously
termed Syndrome X, the insulin resis-
tance syndrome, and the metabolic syn-
drome. The Third Report of the National
Cholesterol Education Program (Adult
Treatment Panel III [ATP III]) recognized
the clustering of these major CVD risk fac-
tors, which was termed the metabolic
syndrome, as a secondary target of risk-
reduction therapy (1). Current estimates
indicate that the age-adjusted prevalence
of the metabolic syndrome is roughly
24% among U.S. adults (2). The meta-
bolic syndrome is largely confined to
overweight and obese adults, with preva-
lence estimates of 22% among adults
with a BMI 25 and 30 kg/m2 and 60%
among adults with a BMI 30 kg/m2
(3). In adults free of diabetes, having the
metabolic syndrome independently pre-
dicts incident type 2 diabetes (4). The
metabolic syndrome is also related to an
increased risk of all-cause and CVD mor-
tality in adults with (5) and without (6,7)
type 2 diabetes, independent of other risk
factors.
Although it has been studied exten-
sively in adults, much less is known about
the metabolic syndrome in youth. Cur-
rent estimates indicate that roughly 4% of
U.S. adolescents have a metabolic syn-
drome phenotype, based on an age-
modified definition of the ATP III criteria
established for adults (8). When stratified
by BMI category, roughly 29% of over-
weight adolescents (BMI 95th percen-
tile for age and sex) have a metabolic
syndrome phenotype, compared with 7%
of at-risk-for-overweight adolescents
(BMI 85th and 95th percentile for age
and sex) and 1% of normal-weight ad-
olescents (BMI 85th percentile for age
and sex) (8). Because the prevalence of
overweight has continued to increase
substantially over the past several decades
among children and adolescents in the
U.S. (9), it is also likely that the preva-
lence of the metabolic syndrome pheno-
type has increased among U.S. youth.
This work presents the most recent na-
tional estimates of the prevalence of a
metabolic syndrome phenotype in U.S.
adolescents, based on data from the
1999­2000 National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES).
These results are compared with previous
estimates (8) based on data from
NHANES III (1988­1992).

NHANES includes oversampling of low-
income individuals, adolescents 12­19
years, adults aged 60 years, African
Americans, and Mexican Americans to
improve estimates for these groups. Ap-
proximately 9,965 individuals aged 2
months to 85 years were studied in
NHANES 1999­2000. Over 3,000 indi-
viduals were invited to attend a morning
examination after having fasted over-
night. The NHANES protocol was re-
viewed and approved by the National
Center for Health Statistic's Institutional
Review Board. Fully informed consent
and assent, where applicable, were ob-
tained from all participants before any
testing.
Details of the NHANES protocol and
all laboratory procedures are available
elsewhere. Briefly, height was measured
in an upright position with a stadiometer,
and weight was measured at a standing
position on a self-zeroing scale. The waist
circumference measurement was made at
the midpoint between the bottom of the
rib cage and above the top of the iliac crest
during minimal respiration. Blood pres-
sure measurements were performed by
trained technicians using a standardized
protocol. Three and sometimes four mea-
surements were made on all subjects with
a mercury sphygmomanometer, and the
first and fifth Korotkoff sounds were re-
corded to represent the systolic and dia-
stolic pressures. We used the average of
three recorded measurements in all data
analyses. Blood analytes were stored fro-
zen and shipped to a central laboratory for
analysis. Plasma glucose and serum or
plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol
were all measured using fully enzymatic
techniques.
The initial sample consisted of 2,165
subjects aged 12­19 years who had a fast-
ing plasma glucose value recorded. Only
subjects who had complete data were in-
cluded in this study. Subjects who had
not fasted for at least 6 h, who were preg-
nant, or who were taking medications to
regulate blood glucose (e.g., insulin or an
oral hypoglycemic agent) were excluded
from the analysis. The final sample con-
sisted of 991 adolescent subjects.
Metabolic syndrome and overweight
definitions
To allow for statistical comparisons
between NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2000, we used the age-modified
standards of the ATP III metabolic syn-
drome criteria published previously (8).
We established the abdominal obesity cri-
terion by analyzing all adolescents in the
current dataset who had a waist circum-
ference recorded. Subjects with a value
90th percentile for age and sex from this
sample population were classified as hav-
ing abdominal obesity. The blood pres-
sure criterion was defined as a value
90th percentile for age, sex, and height,
based on published reference data (10).
The blood glucose (110 mg/dl), triglyc-
eride (110 mg/dl), and HDL cholesterol
(40 mg/dl) standards in the present
study were identical to the cut points used
previously (8). Subjects who met at least
three of the five criteria were classified as
having a metabolic syndrome phenotype.
Overweight among adolescents was a
statistical definition based on the 2000
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion growth charts for the U.S. (9), de-
fined as 95th percentile of BMI for age
and sex. At risk for overweight was de-
fined as 85th but 95th percentile of
BMI for age and sex and normal weight as
85th percentile of BMI for age and sex.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using STATA with
survey replication package SVR (version
7; STATA, College Station, TX). All anal-
yses were completed using the morning
subsample weights to estimate means and
95% CIs, and the jackknife replication
weights were used to estimate the SEs of
those means using the delete-one-
jackknife method (11). Prevalence values
for those subjects with and without the
metabolic syndrome were compared us-
ing the 2 test for proportions. Differ-
ences between surveys for the metabolic
syndrome phenotype overall, by sex, and
by race/ethnic group were tested univa-
riately using the t test for independent
samples. Statistical significance was es-
tablished at   0.05 a priori, and all
multiple comparisons were adjusted us-
ing the Bonferroni method.
RESULTS -- The prevalence of a met-
abolic syndrome phenotype was 6.4%
(95% CI 3.8­8.9) among U.S. adoles-
cents. Based on population-weighted es-
timates, 2,070,950 U.S. adolescents
have a metabolic syndrome phenotype.
The syndrome was more common in male
(9.1%, 4.8­13.4) than in female (3.7%,
0.2­7.1) adolescents (P  0.01); how-
ever, there was no difference (P  0.3) in
the prevalence when examined by race/
ethnic group (8.5% in Mexican Ameri-
cans, 7.2% in non-Hispanic whites, and
5.1% in non-Hispanic blacks). When ex-
amined by BMI category, 32.1% of over-
weight adolescents had the syndrome
compared with 7.1% of adolescents at risk
for overweight and with 1% of adoles-
cents with normal weight (P  0.001).
The proportion of subjects with one
or more abnormalities of the adolescent
metabolic syndrome phenotype is pre-
sented in Table 1. In this sample, roughly
43% of subjects had one or more risk fac-
tors, nearly 17% had two or more risk
factors, and 1% had four or more risk
factors. We also examined the proportion
of subjects with one or more abnormali-
ties using a fasting plasma glucose cut
point 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) (12). By
doing so, the proportion of subjects with
the metabolic syndrome phenotype in-
creased slightly to 6.7%. The proportion
of subjects who had one or more individ-
ualriskfactorsincreasedto45.9%,where-
as 18.9% had two or more risk factors and
1.8% had four or more risk factors.
The distribution of the individual
components of the metabolic syndrome
phenotype is shown in Table 2. Overall,
high fasting triglycerides and low HDL
cholesterol were the most commonly sat-
isfied criteria (23.2 and 23.4%, respec-
tively), whereas high fasting glucose was
the least common (1.1%). However, low-
ering the fasting plasma glucose cut point
from 110 to 100 mg/dl (6.1 to 5.6
mmol/l) increased the proportion of sub-
jects who met this standard to 7.6%.
The overall prevalence of a meta-
bolic syndrome phenotype increased
significantly (P  0.001) from 4.2% in
NHANES III (1988­1992) to 6.4% in
NHANES 1999­2000 (Fig. 1). When
examined by sex, the prevalence in-
creased from 6.1 to 9.1% in male adoles-
cents and from 2.1 to 3.7% in female
adolescents (P  0.001) (Fig. 1). When
examined by race/ethnic group, the prev-
alence increased from 5.6 to 8.5% in Mex-
ican Americans, from 4.8 to 7.2% in non-
Hispanic whites, and from 2.0 to 5.1% in
non-Hispanic blacks (P  0.001) (Fig. 2).
CONCLUSIONS -- The major new
finding from this study is that the preva-
lence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype
has increased significantly over the past
decade among U.S. adolescents. Based on
population-weighted estimates, 2 mil-

metabolic syndrome phenotype. The
trend for increasing metabolic syndrome
prevalence was evident in both sexes and
in all three major race/ethnic groups ana-
lyzed in this study.
A metabolic syndrome phenotype
was most common in overweight adoles-
cents, with a prevalence of 32.1%, com-
pared with only 7.1% of at-risk-for-
overweight adolescents. The difference in
metabolic syndrome prevalence among
overweight compared with at-risk-for-
overweight adolescents was striking and
further underscores the importance of
small amounts of weight loss in poten-
tially avoiding the development of the
metabolic syndrome and related se-
quelae. These findings are consistent with
published results (8), in which 28.1 and
6.8% of overweight and at-risk-for-

Metabolic syndrome phenotype in adolescents
2440 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 27, NUMBER 10, OCTOBER 2004
overweight adolescents, respectively, had
a metabolic syndrome phenotype based
on data from NHANES III (1988­1992).
Together, these studies indicate that a
metabolic syndrome phenotype is likely
present in at least 30% of all U.S. adoles-
cents who are overweight. It is not en-
tirely surprising that this syndrome has
increased over the past decade among
U.S. adolescents because overweight per
se has also increased in the same time pe-
riod in this group (9) and the metabolic
syndrome phenotype is largely confined
to overweight adolescents. This is consis-
tent with findings in adults, in whom the
metabolic syndrome was found in
roughly 5, 22, and 60% of normal-
weight, overweight, and obese men and
women, respectively (3).
In adults, older age, postmenopausal
status, Mexican-American ethnicity,
higher BMI, current smoking, low house-
hold income, high carbohydrate intake,
no alcohol consumption, and physical in-
activity are associated with an increased
risk of developing the metabolic syn-
drome (3). Central adiposity, and specif-
ically a high level of visceral fat, is a
hallmark feature of the metabolic syn-
drome in adults (13­16). Furthermore,
central obesity appears to be the major
discriminating factor when comparing
metabolic syndrome prevalence differ-
ences in various populations (17). Adults
with the metabolic syndrome are also
characterized by low levels of cardiorespi-
ratory fitness (VO2max
) (18­21) and ab-
normalities in several inflammatory
biomarkers (14­16,22,23).
Although it has been studied exten-
sively in adults, much less is known about
the metabolic syndrome in youth. A clus-
tering of risk factors related to the meta-
bolic syndrome, including total and HDL
cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and
blood pressure, were investigated in a
large group of Danish boys and girls (aged
9­15 years). In this study (24), 5.4% of
the sample had four or five risk factors,
and in these individuals, VO2max
was 1.2
SDs lower and BMI 1.6 SDs higher than
the mean levels for these variables in the
sample population. A population-based
study (25) of factors leading to the meta-
bolic syndrome demonstrated that one-
half of the obese children sampled at age 7
years had become obese adults at fol-
low-up and had a high risk of developing
the metabolic syndrome; this risk was sig-
nificantly lower among the obese adults
who had not been obese as children com-
pared with the obese adults who had also
been obese as children. In adults, it is well
established that the progression from nor-
mal to impaired glucose tolerance, and
subsequently to type 2 diabetes, is char-
acterized by peripheral insulin resistance
and defects in -cell function (26,27). In-
sulin resistance is thought to be the major
underlying feature of the metabolic syn-
drome (28). Along these same lines, a re-
cent study (29) demonstrated that obese
children and adolescents with impaired
glucose tolerance had high levels of vis-
ceral and intramyocellular fat, and this al-
tered fat partitioning was closely linked to
severe peripheral insulin resistance.
Thus, the factors leading to the develop-
ment of the metabolic syndrome in adults
are also likely operating in youth, includ-

ing increased BMI, visceral fat accumula-
tion, and low cardiorespiratory fitness.
Because overweight adolescents are
particularly at risk for developing the
metabolic syndrome, they are also more
likely to develop the metabolic complica-
tions of overweight in adulthood. This
notion is supported by findings from clus-
ter-tracking studies (30,31) demonstrat-
ing that overweight in youth persists into
adulthood and may be associated with
subsequent adverse health outcomes in
later life. Similarly, several population-
based studies have demonstrated that el-
evated blood lipid (32­37) and blood
pressure (35­37) levels in childhood are
associated with elevated levels in adult-
hood. Together, these studies demon-
strate that risk factors related to the
metabolic syndrome tend to track from
childhood to adulthood, increasing the
risk for adverse health outcomes in later
life. For example, in adults who do not
have diabetes, having the metabolic syn-
drome predicts incident type 2 diabetes
independent of age, sex, ethnicity, family
history of type 2 diabetes, impaired glu-
cose tolerance, and fasting insulin levels
(4). In adults who have type 2 diabetes,
the presence of the metabolic syndrome is
associated with a fivefold increase in CVD
risk independent of age, sex, smoking sta-
tus, and HbA1c
(5). However, the risk of
developing type 2 diabetes and CVD in
youth who have the metabolic syndrome
is unknown.
The number of U.S. adolescents who
had one or more abnormalities of the syn-
drome also increased from previous find-
ings. In the present study, roughly 43% of
subjects had at least one risk factor, nearly
17% had two or more risk factors, and
6.4% had three or more risk factors (i.e.,
metabolic syndrome) (Table 1). In
NHANES III,  41% had at least one risk
factor, 14% had two or more risk factors,
and 4.2% had three or more risk factors
(8). When we used a fasting plasma glu-
cose cut point of 100 mg/dl (5.6
mmol/l) to establish the high glucose level
threshold, the proportion of subjects who
had one or more individual risk factors
increased to 46%, two or more risk fac-
tors to 19%, and three or more risk factors
to 6.7% (Table 1). Although the high glu-
cose level standard was least common,
whereas high fasting triglycerides and low
HDL cholesterol were most common (Ta-
ble 2), lowering the fasting plasma glu-
cose cut point from 110 to 100 mg/dl (6.1
to 5.6 mmol/l) increased the proportion
of subjects who met this standard to
7.6%. Closer inspection of our data re-
veals that the major cause of the shifts
noted above was a large proportion of
Mexican-American and non-Hispanic
white subjects who met the new glucose
standard. For example, the proportion of
Mexican-American adolescents who met
the different glucose standards increased
from 0.4 to 13.5% for the 110- and 100-
mg/dl thresholds, whereas the proportion
of non-Hispanic white youth meeting
these standards increased from 1.4 to
8.1%. Thus, these groups of adolescents
appear to be particularly prone to abnor-
malities in glucose metabolism.
Although no national definition of the
metabolic syndrome in youth currently
exists, we chose to use methods identical
to those used previously in order to make
statistical comparisons between NHANES
III (1988­1992) and NHANES 1999­
2000. This allowed us to estimate the cur-
rent prevalence of a metabolic syndrome
phenotype in adolescents and to deter-
mine trends for this condition over the
past decade. The cross-sectional nature of
the NHANES surveys does not allow us to
make causal inferences as to the underly-
ing relationship between developing
overweight and the metabolic syndrome
in youth. However, because both condi-
tions have continued to increase in parallel
over relatively short periods in genetically
stable populations, our findings point to
major changes in lifestyle, such as poor
diet and physical inactivity, as major con-
tributors to the increasing prevalence of a
metabolic syndrome phenotype in youth.
Our findings provide evidence of an
emerging public health problem that cuts
across both sexes and all major ethnic/
racial groups and further underscores the
importance of early intervention to pre-
vent overweight in youth. Elucidating the
precursors of the metabolic syndrome in
youth may lead to effective therapies to
prevent its development or to mitigate its
consequences later in life.
