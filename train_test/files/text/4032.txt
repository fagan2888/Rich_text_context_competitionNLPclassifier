What do you do when you have an aching tooth or a hurting
leg? Of course, you would go and see a dentist or a doctor.
But what do you do when you are feeling physically okay
but you want to get into a more positive mood? Your first
thought is probably not to seek help from a physician.
For a long time, psychologists have focused on negative
mental states and developed, practiced, and evaluated ther-
apies for curing these states. When introducing positive
psychology, Seligman (2002) strongly demanded that psy-
chology should focus more on positive well-being. Rather
than just trying to get people from -5 back to the 0 line, we
should aim at getting them to +5. In this article, we will
present two routes to better health, each focusing on one
specific aspect. On one hand, we will discuss resilience as
an individual difference factor that helps people cope with
stress and prevents them from becoming ill. On the other
hand, we suggest that social identification with teams and
groups provides a social cure (Jetten et al., 2012) that helps
people maintain happy and engaged lives beyond the mere
absence of ill-health. More specifically, our study aimed to
extend previous research by testing, for the first time, the
hypothesis that resilience as an individual difference varia-
ble helps people cope with stress--that is, reducing the
negative--whereas social identification with groups helps
people to achieve a satisfactory life and increase their well-
being--that is, fostering the positive.
Resilience and well-being
Stress-related illness represents one of the biggest chal-
lenges to modern societies, but there is mounting evi-
dence that individuals substantially vary in how they
react to stressors. When facing daily hassles such as time
pressure (see Cassidy, 2000; Kanner et al., 1981), or criti-
cal life events such as job loss or a divorce, some people
develop mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety
disorders. Other people, however, do not show such neg-
ative reactions to similar stressors. In other words, some
Two sides of the same coin and two
routes for improvement: Integrating
resilience and the social identity
approach to well-being and ill-health

Abstract
We propose that resilience effectively helps people cope with stress, thus predominantly reducing the negative. However,
we argue that individuals' social identification has the potential to contribute to their well-being, thus fostering the
positive. A two-wave survey study of 180 students shows that resilience is more strongly (negatively) associated with
ill-health (i.e. stress and depression), whereas social identification is more strongly (positively) related to well-being (i.e.
satisfaction and work engagement). We believe that it is necessary to see these two routes to improving people's health
as complementary, both in future research and for therapy and interventions.

2 Health Psychology Open 
individuals seem to be resilient against stressors and they
apparently have the biological, social, or psychological
resources to cope with such negative experiences.
Luthans et al. (2007) defined resilience as the "capacity
to rebound or bounce back from adversity, conflict, or
failure" (p. 18). It is one of the core concepts of positive
psychology that has been studied and found to be predic-
tive of people's health--even under stressful circum-
stances. Gloria and Steinhardt (2016), for instance, found
a buffering effect of resilience on the relation between
stress and anxiety and depression. Shamaskin-Garroway
et al. (2016) found more adjustment to effects of
Parkinson's disease, and Yi-Frazier et al. (2015) found
among diabetes patients that high resilience was associ-
ated with less distress, better glycemic control, and the
use of more adaptive coping strategies.
A recent meta-analysis by Hu et al. (2015) summarized
60 studies with a total of 111 effect sizes and looked at the
relation between trait resilience and health-related variables.
The analyses revealed an average effect of -.36 between
resilience and negative indicators of well-being (i.e. depres-
sion, anxiety, and negative affect). The authors also identi-
fied positive relations between resilience and general life
satisfaction and positive affect but no measures of domain-
specific satisfaction or work engagement were included in
the analyses. We found only one study that has investigated
the relationship between resilience and work engagement by
Mache et al. (2014) who reported a positive correlation in a
cross-sectional survey of medical doctors in Germany. In
line with the definition of Luthans et al. (2007), which sug-
gests that resilience shows a buffering effect in the occur-
rence of negative event, Hu et al. (2015) also found that
adversity was moderating the resilience-ill-health effect.
That is, resilience was more strongly (negatively) related to
ill-health in times of adversity. In this study, we further
explore the idea of resilience as a variable that helps people
cope with stress and thus reduces ill-health.
Social identity and well-being
The social identity approach (cf. Haslam, 2004; Jetten
et al., 2012) states that groups that provide us with a sense
of belonging are good for health and well-being. The theo-
retical foundation for these beneficial effects is derived
from social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner, 1979) and
self-categorization theory (Turner, 1985). A key idea of
these theories is that when individuals identify with groups,
they have a common perspective and coordinate their
behavior with respect to group norms. This also leads to
providing and receiving more social support which in turn
helps developing a stronger sense of collective self-effi-
cacy (e.g. Avanzi et al., 2015; see also Blecharz et al., 2014
for the mediating role of collective efficacy between moti-
vational climate and the well-being of athletes). In addi-
tion, it has been proposed that a shared social identity
serves as a basis for a more favorable interpretation of
social support (Haslam et al., 2012). In line with this
notion, it has been found that social support has more posi-
tive effects if the provider and recipient of support share a
social identity (Frisch et al., 2014). Above and beyond this
potential to better cope with stressors due to more support
and higher self-efficacy, social identification should also
lead to greater well-being because it satisfies basic human
needs for belonging and affiliation, certainty, and safety
(e.g. Greenaway et al., 2016; Ketturat et al., 2016). The
importance of social relationships for well-being has also
been suggested by Rusk and Waters (2015) in their psy-
cho-social system approach and by Stavrova and Luhmann
(2016) who found that collective connectedness was
related to a higher sense of meaning in life and vice versa.
Along similar lines, Stok et al. (2014) showed that partici-
pants who identified strongly with groups with pro-health
norms had higher vegetable consumption. On one hand,
one would predict such positive effects of shared group
identities and high identification only if the respective
group is supportive and promotes healthy living norms
(e.g. Sani et al., 2015). Group membership may, on the
other hand, harm well-being when the group norms pre-
scribe unhealthy behaviors (e.g. binge drinking, see
Gardner et al., 2012), or when relations between members
in a group are toxic and hostile.
Steffens et al. (2017) have recently provided meta-ana-
lytic evidence that identification in organizational contexts
is indeed related to people's health. Importantly, these
authors also argued that identification should be more
closely related to the presence of well-being rather than to
the absence of stress because "high social identification is
generally construed to be a basis for experiencing positive
outcomes (e.g. support, belonging, control, agency) rather
than to be a basis for avoiding negative outcomes" (Steffens
et al., 2017: 11­12). We further investigated this idea in a
longitudinal study with students at the beginning and at the
(generally more stressful) end of the academic term.
Hypotheses
Building on existing theory and research, we predict the
following:
Hypothesis 1. Students'resilience at the beginning of the
academic term will positively relate to (a) study satisfac-
tion and (b) work engagement, and negatively relate to
(c) anxiety and depression and (d) chronic stress
3months later.
Hypothesis 2. Students' social identification at the
beginning of the academic term will positively relate to
(a) study satisfaction and (b) work engagement, and
negatively relate to (c) anxiety and depression and (d)
chronic stress 3months later.
Van Dick et al. 3
Furthermore, we predict that resilience is more closely
related to ill-health rather than well-being. This should be
the case because the definition of resilience involves some
adversity and coping with it. Resilience thus buffers nega-
tive effects of stressors and should help people not getting
ill from such adversity. Identification, on the other hand,
not only helps activating social support resources and foster
collective self-efficacy but also exerts a main effect on peo-
ple's health because of its function to satisfy people's needs
for belonging, affiliation, and safety:
Hypothesis 3a. Resilience will be more strongly related to
measures of ill-health than to measures of well-being.
Hypothesis 3b. Social identification will be more
strongly related to measures of well-being than to meas-
ures of ill-health.
Methods
Sample and procedure
We used an online survey to measure the study concepts.
In introductory lectures, we approached students in
Bachelor and Master programs of various disciplines at the
beginning of the academic term and informed them about
the purpose and design of this study. We explained that the
data were collected anonymously and that participation
was voluntary. A total of 235 students participated in the
first wave and provided an individual code so that we
could match the data at the second wave, 3
months later.
For the second wave, we chose a time around the end-of-
term exams which should be perceived as stressful by stu-
dents (see for an analysis of stress among undergraduate
and graduate students: Bedewy and Gabriel, 2015). At
time 2, 180 students participated again and formed the
basis of our analyses. Of these, 91.7percent were female,
averageagewas22years(standarddeviation(SD)=5years)
and 79percent were first year students.
Measures
At time 1, we measured the dependent variables, namely,
identification and resilience. Social identification with fel-
low students, lecturers, and the university were measured
adopting items from Doosje et al. (1995) and Mael and
Ashforth (1992). We provided the items with a 7-point
answering scale (endpoints "completely agree" and "com-
pletely disagree," sample item: "I feel strong ties with other
students in my program"). Altogether, 14 items were used
and collapsed into one scale. We measured resilience using
the Brief Resilience Scale (Smith et al., 2008) with six items
(sample item: "I tend to bounce back quickly after hard
times") and the same answering scale as for identification.
At time 2, we measured all dependent variables. We
measured students' study satisfaction with five items
adapted from Holm-Hadulla and Hofmann (2007). The
items asked for satisfaction with several aspects such as the
general study conditions or one's personal study situation
(5-point answering scales with endpoints "very dissatis-
fied" and "very satisfied").
Work engagement was measured using the 17-item
Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (Schaufeli et al., 2006;
7-point answering scale with endpoints "never" and
"always," sample items: "At my work, I feel bursting with
energy," "I find the work that I do full of meaning and pur-
pose," "Time flies when I am working").
Chronic stress was measured with the Trier Inventory
for Chronic Stress (TICS) screening scale (Schulz et al.,
2004) comprising 12 items and a 5-point answering scale
(endpoints "never" and "very often," sample items: "I
find it difficult to ignore negative thoughts and stop wor-
rying," "Despite my best efforts, my work finds no
recognition").
Finally, depression and anxiety were measured with four
items of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4)
(Kroenke et al., 2009; 4-point answering scale with end-
points "never" and "almost daily," sample item: "Over the
past two weeks, I experienced little interest and enjoyment
in my work").
Results
Table 1 provides means, standard deviations, scale inter-
correlations, and Cronbach's alphas. First, we used con-
firmatory factor analysis using MPlus 7 to test whether the
four dependent variables form distinctive factors. For the
latent factor of depression/anxiety, we used four and for
the latent factor of satisfaction, we used five variables as
indicators. For the latent factors of work engagement and
stress, we used parceling and combined half of the items
into one indicator each (i.e. two parcels for engagement
and two for stress). As expected, a model comprising four
latent variables with two second-order factors, namely, one
factor for ill-health (comprising stress and depression/anxi-
ety) and a second factor for well-being (comprising satis-
faction and engagement), fit the data best (2=125.02,
degree of freedom (df)=60, p
<
.05; comparative fit index
(CFI)=.94; Tucker­Lewis index (TLI)=.92; root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA)
=
.078; standard-
ized root mean square residual (SRMR)=.058) and signifi-
cantly better than a model with all indicators (respectively,
parcels) loading on a single factor (2=1085.02, df=78,
p<.05; CFI=.63; TLI=.56; RMSEA=.18; SRMR=.11).
As expected, the two second-latent order factors were sig-
nificantly related (-.71, the average absolute correlation
between the four scales is much lower with r=.47) but the
unshared variation of about 50percent shows that they are
not simply endpoints of a continuum but represent distinct
aspects--which supports our view of well-being and ill-
health being two sides of one coin.
4 Health Psychology Open 
To test our hypotheses, we compared correlation coeffi-
cients and ran regression analyses (see Table 2). Resilience
was, as predicted in Hypothesis 1, both in the simple correla-
tions and in the regression analyses, significantly and posi-
tively related to students' satisfaction (H1a) and work
engagement (H1b) 3months later and negatively and signifi-
cantly related to depression/anxiety (H1c) and stress level
(H1d). As predicted in Hypothesis 2a and b, we found sig-
nificant and positive relations between social identification
and students' satisfaction and engagement. Unexpectedly,
however, we found no relation between social identification
and depression/anxiety or stress (H2c and H2d).
As can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, identification was
more closely related to measures of well-being compared to
resilience, whereas resilience was more closely related to
measures of ill-health. To test Hypothesis 3 more formally,
we computed average correlations and tested the differ-
ences using z-tests. The average correlation of resilience
and ill-health was .44 (absolute value) compared to the
average correlation of resilience and well-being of .25; the
difference was significant (z=-2.87, p<. 005; Cohen's
q=.22), thereby supporting H3a. The average correlation of
identification and ill-health was .06 (absolute value) com-
pared to the average correlation of identification and well-
being of .29; the difference was significant (z=3.18,
p<.005; Cohen's q=.24), supporting H3b.
Discussion
We found that indicators of well-being and ill-health repre-
sent two sides of the same coin. As predicted, students'
resilience and social identification both explained positive
outcomes (i.e. less stress and greater well-being) over a
period of 3
months. However, social identification was
related to well-being but not to ill-health. Resilience was
related to both aspects but, as expected, was more strongly
related to ill-health than to well-being.
Our study has some limitations. Most importantly, we
only surveyed a specific group of university students which
is not representative of the wider population. However, we
see no reason to assume, that the general pattern of resil-
ience being a stronger predictor for negative outcomes and
identification being a stronger predictor for positive out-
comes should not generalize to other domains, even though
the specific types of stressors might differ. Second, the use
of self-reports may limit the validity of our findings.
However, we used standardized scales designed for and
commonly used as self-assessment. Also, it has been shown
repeatedly that subjective indicators of health such as satis-
faction are predictive of objective outcome such as longev-
ity (Diener and Chan, 2011).
Clearly, the strength of our study is the longitudinal
design allowing tentative causal inferences, and the fact
that we actually found the predicted effects over a period of
3months. It would be desirable to replicate our findings in
future studies in other occupational groups, and using
objective health indicators (e.g. endocrinological meas-
ures) and even longer time periods.
As implications for practice, our results point to the fact
that both resilience and social identification are important
pathways for reducing stress and ill-health and for creating
satisfaction and well-being. The good news is that both

factors can be developed. Leppin et al. (2014) meta-analyt-
ically supported the idea that resilience can be built up
with stress-management trainings. They identified 13 stud-
ies which provided a generalized stress training and meas-
ured resilience within 3months of follow-up and found a
moderate average effect of .37. Orzech et al. (2009) tested
the effects of an intensive mindfulness intervention with
10­12hours of training per day for 1month and found sig-
nificant increases in resilience compared to a control
group. Adler et al. (2015) found positive effects on resil-
ience trainings of soldiers during basic combat training for
anxiety reduction.
Likewise, with respect to social identity, Haslam et al.
(2016) have recently shown a relatively simple but effective
way to increase people's usage of their social relations. Based
on the social identity approach to health and well-being, the
authors devised "groups 4 health," a manualized five-module
psychological intervention aiming at developing social group
relationships. In a non-randomized control design with young
adults who suffered from social isolation and affective disor-
ders, a significant increase in participants' social identifica-
tion was found which in turn significantly improved mental
health, well-being, and social connectedness.
It has already been shown that group-based trainings--
possibly because of increased social identity--can be more
successful than individual trainings, for instance, in mind-
fulness mediation trainings to reduce weight (Mantzios and
Giannou, 2014).
Another way to increase people's well-being at work is
through authentic leadership which has been suggested to
unfold its positive effects through increased social identifi-
cation (e.g. Hystad et al., 2014). Future applications of the
two pathways and research combining the two fields of
research are clearly promising.
