Introduction
Researchers approach the world with a set of beliefs and
ideas about the nature of being (ontology), reality, and
truth. This approach raises questions about knowledge and
the relationship of the knower to the known (epistemology)
and determines how a researcher approaches the research
process (methodology) (Lincoln, Lynham, & Guba, 2011).
Methodology includes the strategy and plan of action of a
research study. Methods are the techniques or procedures
that a researcher uses to answer their research question.
Choosing which methods to use, including the recruitment
and sampling of participants, data collection, data record-
ing, data analysis, and reporting, is guided by the research
methodology and the desired outcomes of the study (Crotty,
1998).
Literature aimed at postgraduate students and novice
researchers reiterates the importance of researchers establish-
ing the philosophical foundations of their study from the out-
set (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005). Yet this activity does not
always occur. For example, in the case of grounded theory
research, using the suite of grounded theory methods is often
considered methodologically sufficient and due consideration
is not necessarily given to a study's epistemological and onto-
logical underpinnings. This issue is compounded by the fact
that Glaser and Strauss (1967), the originators of grounded
theory, did not articulate the philosophical foundation of this
design. Glaser's (2004) publication states that classic
grounded theory "is simply a set of integrated conceptual
hypotheses systematically generated to produce an inductive
theory about a substantive area" (Introduction, para.7), effec-
tively dismissing the need for an underpinning philosophical
perspective. Glaser's position, however, should not be used as
a fall back that licenses a methodologically naïve approach to
grounded theory research, particularly given the well-docu-
mented analysis of his position as a post-positivist researcher
(Bryant & Charmaz, 2007). In contrast, Strauss (1993) and
later Corbin and Strauss (Corbin & Strauss, 2008) state a
number of philosophical and sociological assumptions that
explicitly underpin evolved grounded theory.
In the early 1960s, Glaser and Strauss conducted a study
into the experience of dying, culminating in their book
Awareness of Dying (1965) and subsequently The Discovery
of Grounded Theory (1967). Prior to the publication of this
seminal text, social researchers were focusing on verifying
extant theories or on testing barely generated theories.

Linking Symbolic Interactionism and
Grounded Theory Methods in a Research
Design: From Corbin and Strauss'
Assumptions to Action
Jennifer Chamberlain-Salaun1, Jane Mills1, and Kim Usher1
Abstract
This article focuses on Corbin and Strauss' evolved version of grounded theory. In the third edition of their seminal text,
Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, the authors present 16 assumptions
that underpin their conception of grounded theory methodology. The assumptions stem from a symbolic interactionism
perspective of social life, including the themes of meaning, action and interaction, self and perspectives. As research design
incorporates both methodology and methods, the authors aim to expose the linkages between the 16 assumptions and
essential grounded theory methods, highlighting the application of the latter in light of the former. Analyzing the links
between symbolic interactionism and essential grounded theory methods provides novice researchers and researchers new
to grounded theory with a foundation from which to design an evolved grounded theory research study.

However, Discovery changed accepted thinking with its
methods of inductive theory development.
Since the introduction of grounded theory, the methodol-
ogy has diverged into three discernible schools of thought, or
versions: (i) classic grounded theory, which is associated
with Barney Glaser; (ii) evolved grounded theory associated
with Anselm Strauss, Juliette Corbin, and Adele Clarke; and
(iii) constructivist grounded theory, which stems from work
by Kathy Charmaz. In this article, the authors present Corbin
and Strauss' (2008) "lost chapter" and the 16 assumptions,
introduce the reader to essential grounded theory methods,
and provide a background to the development of pragmatism
and symbolic interactionism as the epistemological and
ontological foundations of evolved grounded theory. Rather
than elaborating on specific features and differences between
the three versions of grounded theory, the authors focus on
Corbin and Strauss' 16 assumptions of grounded theory
(2008; Table 1), analyzing them for key symbolic interac-
tionist themes and their links to essential grounded theory
methods. Our purpose is to highlight, particularly for novice
researchers and researchers new to grounded theory, the
links between the assumptions and the fundamental contri-
bution of symbolic interactionism to grounded theory meth-
odology and methods.
The "Lost Chapter"
Grounded theory has its roots in pragmatist philosophy and
symbolic interactionist sociology (Bryant, 2009; Charmaz,
2003; Clarke, 2003; Milliken & Schreiber, 2001; Morse,
1994; Nathaniel, 2011; Schreiber, 2001; Stern & Porr, 2011;
Strauss, 1987). However, until the publication of what we
term the "lost chapter" in Basics of Qualitative Research:
Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded
Theory (Corbin & Strauss, 2008), the influence of pragmatist
philosophy and sociological symbolic interactionist theory
on evolved grounded theory was not explicitly articulated by
Corbin and Strauss. In Chapter 1 of the third edition of the
text, the authors (Corbin & Strauss, 2008) present 16 assump-
tions that underpin their version of grounded theory method-
ology. They accompany this list of assumptions with a brief
discussion on the epistemology and ontology of pragmatism
and symbolic interactionism. Originally written for the sec-
ond edition of Basics of Qualitative Research (Strauss &
Corbin, 1998), the publisher originally considered this sec-
tion "too complicated for a beginning text on qualitative
research" (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 17). Including the
16 assumptions in the latest version of the text provides the
missing link that formally articulates the philosophical and
sociological perspectives underlying Strauss and Corbin's
evolved grounded theory methodology.
Essential Grounded Theory Methods
Grounded theory methodologies use a common "tool box" of
methods in the design and implementation of a study. The
following constitute this set of essential grounded theory
methods: concurrent data generation or collection and analy-
sis; constant comparative analysis; initial coding and catego-
rization of data; intermediate coding; selecting a core
category; advanced coding; theoretical integration; theoreti-
cal sampling, theoretical saturation; theoretical sensitivity;
and writing memos (memoing) (Birks & Mills, 2011, p. 9).
Used together, these methods constitute an unfolding, itera-
tive process of actions and interactions that constitute the
grounded theory research process (Charmaz, 2006).
In this article, we link each of the essential grounded
theory methods to one or more of Corbin and Strauss'
16 assumptions (refer Table 1). Corbin and Strauss (2008)
postulate that readers who familiarize themselves with their
book will "easily grasp the relevance of the assumptions
to [their] version of the [grounded theory] methodology"
(p. 6). However, we believe "unpacking" the assumptions and
their symbolic interactionist themes to explicate the links
with essential grounded theory methods will clarify what it
means to implement an evolved grounded theory design.
The 16 Assumptions
The assumptions are based on Corbin and Strauss'interpreta-
tion of works by John Dewey, George Herbert Mead, Herbert
Blumer, and Anselm Strauss himself. All four scholars are
members of a group of sociologists known as the Chicago
School situated within the University of Chicago (Lutters &
Ackerman, 1996). Table 2 provides a synopsis of each schol-
ar's period at the University and highlights periods when
their tenures overlapped. The Chicago School is particularly
associated with qualitative methodologies, especially those
using a naturalistic observational approach to the study of
human group life and human conduct, such as symbolic
interactionism (Blumer, 1969). A general understanding of
the evolution of symbolic interactionism, and its precursor
pragmatism, provides a point of departure from which to
approach the assumptions and their links to essential
grounded theory methods.
Pragmatism
Pragmatism is a humanistic movement in philosophy, which
emphasizes the role of humans in the creation of objective
and meaningful reality (Shalin, 1991). American pragmatism
emerged between the 1860s and the end of World War II in
the 1940s. During this period, personal material gain was
driving American economic and social progress and scholars
were demanding that philosophical pursuits extend beyond
theory to prove their worth in practice. In a country with a
meagre precapitalist past, pragmatism provided the "philo-
sophical expression of middle class liberalism" (Novak,
1975, p. 12). The unification of knowledge and action, and
applying theory to practice distinguished pragmatist philoso-
phy from other philosophical positions, which at the time
were based on empirical epistemology (Dewey, 1929).

Mead (1936) considered pragmatism "a practical sort of
philosophy" (p. 352), evolving from rationalistic philoso-
phies and a psychological approach to establish "the process
of knowing [-] inside of the process of conduct" (pp. 351-
352). Pragmatism is considered a precursor of symbolic
interactionism (Musolf, 2009; Plummer, 1996; Reynolds,
2003; Sandstrom, Martin, & Fine, 2001; Stryker, 1972).
Symbolic Interactionism
Symbolic interactionism is an empirical social science per-
spective on the study of human group life and human con-
duct (Blumer, 1969). Mead is credited with developing
symbolic interactionism, although he did not use this term.
Blumer explains how he himself offhandedly coined the term
symbolic interactionism in a chapter he wrote for Man and
Society (Blumer, 1937) and that it "somehow caught on and
[came into] general use" (Blumer, 1969, p. 1).
The theory and conceptualization of symbolic interaction-
ism developed during the period between the late 19th and
mid-20th centuries within the Chicago School (Deegan,
2001; Musolf, 2003). Symbolic interactionists distinguish
themselves from other social scientists by their shared claim
to Mead and his original idea that the "human biological
organism possesses a mind and a self" (Herman-Kinney &
Verschaeve, 2003, p. 214). In addition, meaning and the con-
cepts of self, action, and interaction are key interweaving
themes that feature in the various interpretations of symbolic
interactionism.
Reformulating the 16 Assumptions Into
Themes
Meaning and the concepts of action, interaction, self, and
perspectives are themes of symbolic interactionism that fea-
ture in Corbin and Strauss' assumptions (refer Table 1).
Blumer's (1969) three premises of symbolic interaction
highlight the interconnectedness of each of these themes and
"sketch a picture of human society" (Blumer, 1969, p. 72):
Human beings act toward things on the basis of the meanings
that the things have for them . . . [T]he meaning of such things is
derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has
with one's fellows . . . [T]hese meanings are handled in, and
modified through, an interpretative process used by the person
in dealing with the things he encounters. (Blumer, 1969, p. 2)
The three themes of meaning, action and interaction, and
self, together with the subtheme of perspectives are used to
group the 16 assumptions, and to link them with essential
grounded theory methods.
Meaning
In the first half of the 20th century, realist philosophy and
psychological ways (Blumer, 1969) of accounting for the
origin of meaning were particularly dominant. A realist
account of the origin of meaning considers meaning as being
intrinsic to all things. Thus, a hat is a hat. A psychological
view of the origin of meaning contends that meaning is an
expression of sensations, feelings, memories, ideas, atti-
tudes, and motives that are brought into play in connection
with a person's perception of a thing (Blumer, 1969). Thus, a
hat may be viewed as a fashion statement or sun protection.
From a symbolic interactionism perspective, objects such as
hats do not have an innate, permanent character; they cannot
be isolated from what happens to them (Mead, 1959).
Meaning arises in the process of interaction. Meaning is not
fixed and immutable; it is fluid, modifiable, and open to
reappraisal (Blumer, 1969; Charon, 2007; Mead, 1934;
Plummer, 1996).
The process of ascribing meaning (Assumptions 2 and 3)
to data corresponds to the essential grounded theory methods
of initial coding and intermediate coding. Continually reas-
sessing meanings in the data is demonstrated in the essential
grounded theory methods of constant comparative analysis
(Assumptions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8). During the initial and inter-
mediate coding phases, the researcher ascribes meaning to
data through the use of codes. Ascribing meaning is not,
however, an isolated act. Through the process of constantly
comparing data codes to codes, codes to categories, and cat-
egories to categories, the researcher interacts with the data,
continually reassessing meaning to "what is really going on"
in the data (Glaser, 1998, p. 12). Assumptions 2, 3, and 5
highlight the temporal aspects of this process whereby inter-
action with the data changes previous meanings and gener-
ates new ones. Viewing the data in new contexts is not a
matter of simply rejecting past codes and embracing new
ones. It is a process in which previous codes converge into
present analysis to advance the developing theory. Mead
(1959) proposes that "reality exists in a present" (p. 1). In
this, Mead is not referring to a single reality; rather that the
present is the reconstruction of past and imagined future
actions and interactions. The transformative aspect of con-
stant comparative analysis is a unique characteristic that
extends the scope of grounded theory research beyond
descriptive analysis.
A unique feature of grounded theory research is the data
analysis method of selecting a core category. It is the point in
the grounded theory research process where previous actions,
which led to the development of categories and subcatego-
ries, are aligned (Assumption 14). Until this point in the pro-
cess, the researcher attributes meaning to data through the
development of codes, categories, and subcategories.
Comparable with the concept of locating meaning within sys-
tems of meanings (Assumption 3), selecting a core category
requires the researcher to select an overarching concept that
encapsulates all previously developed categories and subcat-
egories (Birks & Mills, 2011). This process requires an inti-
mate and distant relationship to the data and subsequent
categories and subcategories. Intimately questioning the
6 SAGE Open
meaning of the data assists the researcher to reach a point
where the grounded theory can be explained and not merely
described (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Selecting a core category
also requires the researcher to stand back from the data, so
that, with a wide view lens, they can isolate the common fea-
ture in all the categories and subcategories. Selecting a core
category does not, however, commit meaning to an immuta-
ble state. It is a conceptually abstract representation of a range
of meanings that an individual, or team of researchers,
ascribes to data to explain a social phenomenon (Corbin &
Strauss, 2008). Selecting a core category provides the "hook"
on which to hang all other categories and subcategories.
Action and Interaction
Actions arise out of social interaction. Mead (1934) identi-
fies two forms of social interaction: nonsymbolic and sym-
bolic. Nonsymbolic interaction is a "conversation of
gestures" (Mead, 1934, p. 167), a stimulus-response process
in which individuals respond directly to one another's ges-
tures or action (Blumer, 1969). Interaction becomes sym-
bolic when individuals interpret and define objects and their
own or another's actions and act on the basis of assigned
meanings. Symbolic interaction is an interpretive process
that directs the actions of the one doing the interpreting and
conveys to the other, or to one's self, how he or she "is to act"
(Blumer, 1969, p. 66). It is a cyclical and fluid process, in
which participants continually adapt or change their acts to
fit the ongoing acts of one other.
The symbolic interactionism theme of action and interac-
tion is a feature of all the assumptions, and interacting with
participants, the data, and with one's self are key activities in
grounded theory research. Assumption 9 refers to the review
and evaluation of actions and their influence on future actions
and interactions. This assumption demonstrates the pro-
cesses of interaction and action within grounded theory
methods of concurrent generation or collection and analysis
of data, and theoretical sampling. Concurrently generating or
collecting and analyzing data requires the researcher to inter-
act with a first round of study participants and data prior to
advancing to the next stage of data collection and analysis.
The results of this interactive process direct what and from
whom or where the researcher will theoretically sample the
next phase of data collection. Data generation, collection and
analysis, and theoretical sampling are iterative processes that
continue throughout the research process until a theory is
fully developed.
During a course of action and interaction, contingencies
are likely to arise (Assumption 4). In Continual permutations
of action, Strauss (1993) defines two types of contingencies,
external and internal, that may affect a course of action. The
first are external contingencies such as economic, political,
organizational, and social world conditions (Assumption 15).
Being aware of external conditions that may influence an
individual's actions is a consideration when undertaking
concurrent data generation and analysis. When comparing
data through the process of constant comparative analysis,
patterns in the data relating to external conditions may
become apparent. The researcher is cautioned, however, not
to force the data (Glaser, 1992). Strauss and Corbin (1990)
and Strauss (1993) suggest using a conditional matrix to con-
ceptualize, discover, and keep track of conditions that influ-
ence the phenomenon being studied. During the intermediate
coding phase, when categories and subcategories are devel-
oped, external conditions and their properties, such as time
and place, are identified and explored. The challenge for the
researcher is to explore the effects and interconnectedness of
external conditions on the process of interaction and not
merely to rely on conditions to provide a background for
understanding the context of the phenomenon (Strauss,
1993). The effects and interconnectedness of conditions are
incorporated into the advanced coding and theoretical inte-
gration stages when categories and subcategories are inte-
grated into a grounded theory that comprehensively explains
the phenomenon under study. The second type of contin-
gency is the course of action itself. Unanticipated conse-
quences that may arise in any course of action become
consequential for pursuant acts. That is, unanticipated conse-
quences become internal conditions in the process of interac-
tion (Strauss, 1993).
Individuals are members of multiple social worlds and
subworlds and these worlds are not without problematic
interactions. Assumption 16 refers to the formation of arenas
in which problematic interactions between social worlds and
subworlds may be discussed, debated, and or resolved
(Strauss, 1993). Clarke (2003) suggests that mapping study
participants' memberships within social worlds/arenas is a
useful analytic exercise that "lays out all of the collective
actors" (Clarke, 2003, p. 559), which then provides the
researcher with a view of their own and participants' affilia-
tions within the broader social context. Understanding the
broader social context provides insights into macro-level
interactions that may influence individuals and groups of
individuals' actions and interactions. It also provides insight
into participants' arenas, which as Strauss (1993) states "are
central to an understanding of `social order'" (p. 242).
Identifying the researcher's and participants' membership
of social worlds and subworlds occurs, in the case of the
researcher, at the very beginning of the research process, and
in the case of participants during concurrent data collection
and analysis. Researchers may wish to explore their mem-
bership of social worlds through the use of memo writing.
Although some researchers confine memo writing to the
grounded theory stages between data collection and theory
construction (Charmaz, 2003; Glaser, 1978) or see it as
unique to data analysis (Corbin & Strauss, 2008), writing
memos from the conceptual stages of a research study can
assist researchers to identify their world-views, member-
ships' of social worlds, and biases. Identifying and reflecting
on these elements can guide methodological decisions,
Chamberlain-Salaun et al. 7
thereby influencing how essential grounded theory methods
are used (Birks & Mills, 2011).
Identifying participants'membership of social worlds and
subworlds is most likely to occur during concurrent data col-
lection and analysis, through the collection of demographic
data and through discussions with participants in the inter-
view process. During intermediate coding, understanding
study participants' broader social contexts may assist the
researcher to conceptualize how codes previously developed
in the initial coding phase may relate to each other.
Understanding broader social contexts also provides contex-
tual variants, which can be included in the storyline during
advanced coding and theoretical integration (Birks & Mills,
2011; Birks, Mills, Francis, & Chapman, 2009; Corbin &
Strauss, 2008).
The intrinsic link between actions and emotions is empha-
sized in Assumption 11. Expressed emotions and feelings are
often preceded or succeeded by action or inaction; they are
part of the same flow of events. Recognizing these linkages
is particularly important when concurrently collecting and
analyzing data. Identifying participants' emotions and feel-
ings during data collection and analysis can provide the
researcher with cues as to meanings that participants ascribe
to events and situations relating to the phenomena under
study (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Hoare, Buetow, Mills, and
Francis (2012) explore the researcher's role in a study in
whichtheresearcherwasbothaparticipantandtheresearcher.
The article highlights the duality of the researcher's emic, or
insider, perspective and etic, or outsider, perspective.
Documenting your own emotions, feelings, and associated
actions, particularly in light of your emic and etic perspec-
tives, enables you, as the researcher, to more fully explore
and challenge your interpretations of the research data. This
process heightens your sensitivity to the data and to the
research process (Birks, Chapman, & Francis, 2008).
Self
The French anthropologist and sociologist Le Breton (2008)
refers to the symbolic interactionism concept of self as "a
corner stone of the conceptual edifice" (p. 62; translation by
Chamberlain-Salaun).Self is central to all social acts.
According to Mead (1934, 1959) self arises through social
process (Blumer, 1969; Charon, 2007; Mead, 1934). Mead's
concept of self differs from the accepted psychological and
sociological concepts of self, dominant in the first half of the
20th century, which view self as a definitive stable entity
(Blumer, 1969; Charon, 2007). Instead, Mead's self consists
of the subjective "I" and the objective "me." In other words,
the human being is an object to one's self and one's own
actions. Self is continually constituted through reflexive pro-
cesses, or self-interaction. The individual is a self-conscious
being able to reflect back on itself and act toward itself as
one may act toward others. The self exists for the individual
insofar as the individual assumes the roles of the other
(Blumer, 1969; Mead, 1959). Through taking the role of the
other, one can view oneself from different perspectives and
correlate these perspectives to make meaning of one's own
world (Murphy, 1959). Baert (1998) refers to this as the
interactionist dimension of self, whereas the symbolic
dimension of self refers to the self's "dependency on the
sharing of symbols, in particular language, with other selves"
(1998, p. 69).
Self is implicit in all of the essential grounded theory
methods. However, it is in the act of memoing and in devel-
oping theoretical sensitivity that the symbolic interactionist
concept of self predominates. Similar to the stream of con-
sciousness produced by a character in a Virginia Woolf novel,
memos record the researcher's reflexive processes, the inter-
nal discussions between the "I" and "me," while providing
an audit trail of "the thinking that goes into [-] decisions and
actions" (Charon, 2007, p. 119). The concept of self-interac-
tion and its influence on actions and interactions is demon-
strated inAssumptions 8 and 9.As highlighted inAssumption
9, reviews and evaluations made along the action/interaction
course may influence the direction or even recast the course.
Recording actions, feelings, thoughts, and impressions in the
form of memos preserves ideas and provides a tangible
means for researchers to review the research process related
to their study, including decisions made and actions taken
(Birks et al., 2008; Milliken & Schreiber, 2001).
Assumption 7 draws from Mead's (1934, 1959) concept
of the continually constituted reflexive self and can be linked
to the essential grounded theory method of theoretical sensi-
tivity. Theoretical sensitivity relates to a researcher's insight
into themselves, others, and the area they are researching
(Glaser & Strauss, 1967). It is demonstrated by a research-
er's ability to recognize nuances in the data, to extract data
elements relevant to a developing grounded theory, and to
reconstruct meaning from data generated with participants
(Birks & Mills, 2011; Corbin & Strauss, 2008; Mills, Bonner,
& Francis, 2006). The act of memoing supports the develop-
ment of theoretical sensitivity. It provides the researcher with
a mechanism for contemporaneously recording and reflect-
ing on their thoughts, feelings, and actions, thus providing
insight into themself (Assumption 9). Similar to Mead's self,
which continues to develop throughout a person's life, a
researcher's theoretical sensitivity continues to develop
throughout the grounded theory research process. An exam-
ple of acquiring theoretical sensitivity in a grounded theory
study is demonstrated in Hoare, Mills, and Francis (2012).
Perspectives
A grounded theory research process is not an objective pro-
cess. Instead it is an interwoven process that integrates the
phenomenon under study, with the study participants' and
the researchers' perspectives and interpretations. An indi-
vidual's perspective and how they interpret the world, an
event or a situation, influences how they act (Blumer, 1969)
8 SAGE Open
and this is highlighted in Assumptions 5, 6, 13, and 15. In a
grounded theory study, the researcher negotiates divergent
perspectives within the data to produce an integrated theory.
Conscious awareness of multiple perspectives and how per-
spectives influence participants' and the researcher's own
actions and interactions enable the researcher to build varia-
tion into data analysis, particularly during intermediate and
advanced coding (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Understanding
how and why various data elements are interrelated produces
a multi-factorial theory grounded in the data (Silverman,
2011). During the concurrent data generation and analysis
and comparative analysis phases, perspectives must be nego-
tiated (Assumption 6) for action and interaction to proceed.
It is at the intersection of actions (Assumption 13), between
generating and analyzing data, that difference among per-
spectives is highlighted. During initial coding and categori-
zation of data, the researchers negotiate their own perspective
of the substantive area of inquiry with that of the partici-
pant's to make meaning of raw data and assign codes. Over
time and through the process of intermediate coding, in
which codes are grouped together into categories, the
researcher's interpretations of divergent perspectives within
the data may change. Mead (1959) refers to the temporal
aspect of perspectives and interpretations in Assumption 5.
Constant comparative analysis of codes to codes, codes to
categories, and categories to categories facilitates and indeed
impels the researcher to negotiate and renegotiate perspec-
tives to advance the developing grounded theory.
Memoing provides a means through which the researcher
can make visible their internal dialogue regarding the nego-
tiation and integration of their own and participants'perspec-
tives (Milliken & Schreiber, 2001) and heightens the
researcher's theoretical sensitivity (Assumptions 5, 6, and
13). As previously highlighted, memoing also creates a
record of decision making. This may prove particularly valu-
able when actions within the research process are perceived,
by others, as irrational (Assumption 10).
Assumption 15 draws particular attention to the influ-
ence of social worlds and subworlds membership to indi-
viduals' perspectives and therefore their interactions with
others. As Strauss (Strauss, 1993) points out, memberships
are often complex, overlapping, contrasting, and conflict-
ing (Assumption 15) and therefore it is "impossible to ana-
lyze [interaction] in overly simple terms" (Strauss, 1993,
p. 181). Exploring participants' and the researcher's own
membership of various worlds, within the context of the
phenomenon under study, may provide information about
how and why membership influences individuals' perspec-
tives and actions. This can be a valuable aspect to consider
within the data when thinking about where, what, and from
whom to theoretically sample subsequent data. Individual's
membership of social worlds and subworlds may also pro-
vide conditional contexts when developing properties and
dimensions of categories and linking categories together
during intermediate coding (Birks & Mills, 2011; Strauss,
1993). However, the process of symbolic interaction can-
not be simplified to a dependence on conditions such as
social world memberships. Although social worlds and
subworlds influence perspectives and actions, they are
antecedent conditions and their value is in assisting the
researcher to understand individuals' interpretive pro-
cesses; they do not constitute the process itself (Blumer,
1969). The process of symbolic interaction occurs in the
present when actions are interpreted and direct, adapt, and
change ongoing acts.
Assumption 12
The authors agree with Milliken and Schreiber's (2012) con-
tention that a conscious awareness and an appreciation of the
influence of symbolic interactionism in grounded theory
research will enhance the researcher's capacity to "develop a
useful, deep, rich, explanatory theory" (p. 693). Corbin and
Strauss' (2008) inclusion of Assumption 12 in their original
list of assumptions highlights the complex nature of under-
standing human action and interaction and suggests that
grounded theory, with its inherently symbolic interactionist
underpinnings, is an appropriate methodology for under-
standing and interpreting human conduct.
Cross Referencing the Assumptions and Essential
Grounded Theory Methods
Corbin and Strauss' (2008) assumptions summarize their
interpretation of the works of Mead, Blumer, Dewey, and
Strauss himself. This article in turn represents our inter-
pretation of the links between Corbin and Strauss'
assumptions and essential grounded theory methods and
Table 3 provides a cross-referencing overview of link-
ages between these two elements. This cross-referencing
is, however, by no means definitive and is open to alter-
native interpretations.

Theoretical Saturation
Theoretical saturation, which Birks and Mills include in their
list of "essential grounded theory method[s]" (2011, p. 9), is
the point at which categories and subcategories are well
developed, continued data collection and analysis provide no
significant new insights, and previously identified gaps in
the theory are filled (Bloor & Wood, 2006; Corbin & Strauss,
2008; Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Theoretical saturation is not
cross-referenced in Table 3, as the authors do not consider
that the method aligns with any of the 16 assumptions.
Conclusion
It is important for researchers to establish the philosophical
foundations of their research study from the outset. In this
article, the authors unpack the 16 assumptions presented in
Corbin and Strauss' (2008) "lost chapter." Unpacking the
assumptions highlights the inherent symbolic interactionist
themes of meaning, action and interaction, self and perspec-
tives, and explicates their links with essential grounded the-
ory methods. These linkages are our interpretation and are not
intended as a prescription for undertaking a research study
using Corbin and Strauss' version of grounded theory meth-
odology. Rather, providing and explicating these linkages
attempts to clarify what it means to conduct a research study
using an evolved grounded theory approach. Awareness and
an appreciation of the influence of symbolic interactionism to
grounded theory methodology and methods will, we hope,
ease the researcher's journey across the methodology bridge.
