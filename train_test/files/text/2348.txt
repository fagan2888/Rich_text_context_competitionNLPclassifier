Abstract
Background: Maternal educational attainment has been associated with birth outcomes among adult mothers.
However, limited research explores whether academic performance and educational aspiration influence birth
outcomes among adolescent mothers.
Methods: Data from Waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) were
used. Adolescent girls whose first pregnancy occurred after Wave I, during their adolescence, and ended with a
singleton live birth were included. Adolescents' grade point average (GPA), experience of ever skipping a grade and
ever repeating a grade, and their aspiration to attend college were examined as predictors of birth outcomes
(birthweight and gestational age; n = 763). Univariate statistics, bivariate analyses and multivariable models were run
stratified on race using survey procedures.
Results: Among Black adolescents, those who ever skipped a grade had higher offspring's birthweight. Among
non-Black adolescents, ever skipping a grade and higher educational aspiration were associated with higher
offspring's birthweight; ever skipping a grade was also associated with higher gestational age. GPA was not
statistically significantly associated with either birth outcome. The addition of smoking during pregnancy and
prenatal care visit into the multivariable models did not change these associations.
Conclusions: Some indicators of higher academic performance and aspiration are associated with better birth
outcomes among adolescents. Investing in improving educational opportunities may improve birth outcomes
among teenage mothers.
Keywords: Adolescents, Birthweight, Gestational age, Academic performance, Educational aspiration
Background
In 2011, there were 333,771 live births to mothers age
10-19 in the U.S [1]. Negative pregnancy and birth out-
comes, such as infant mortality [2-4], stillbirth [5], con-
genital anomalies [6], preterm birth (PTB), and low
birthweight (LBW) [7] disproportionately affect adolescent
compared to adult mothers. Unfortunately, most research
on determinants of birth outcomes has focused on adult
rather than teen mothers. Given the large number of ado-
lescent births and the related pregnancy complications, it
is important to explore factors that influence birth out-
comes specifically within the teenage group.
Among adult mothers, maternal educational attain-
ment is positively linked with birth outcomes [8-14].
Lower education has been associated with elevated risks
of low birthweight [11,13], preterm birth [8,11,14], small
for gestational age [8,11,12], still birth [8], and infant
death [8]. One study found that there was a positive lin-
ear relationship between maternal year of schooling and
birthweight in black women, and a non-linear relation-
ship in white women, with the optimal level of schooling
with regard to birthweight being about 16 years and
lower or higher levels of education associated with lower
birthweight [9].
Although evidence of the association between mater-
nal educational attainment and birth outcomes has been
consistent, there remain uncertainties about the explan-
ation for the association [9]. Fuchs argues that educated

people invest in their own and their offspring's health in
terms of healthy behaviors and utilization of health care
services [15]. Women with lower educational attainment
are more likely to smoke during pregnancy [16-18], and
some researchers reported that the relationship between
lower maternal education and adverse perinatal outcomes
was (partly) explained by smoking during pregnancy
[11,14,19]. Other studies found that maternal education
and smoking during pregnancy had independent effects
on small-for-gestational-age births and child's antisocial
behaviors [12,16]. Women with lower education are also
more likely to have less or delayed prenatal care [20-22].
The Healthy People 2020 agenda includes goals related
to improving adolescents' academic success and achieve-
ment [23]. Academic performance and educational aspir-
ation during adolescence are found to be related to
educational attainment in adulthood [24,25]. Rumberger
reported that grade retention and poor academic perform-
ance were important factors that were predictive of drop-
ping out of middle school [24]. Grade skipping, which is
one form of grade acceleration [26], has been found to be
associated with better future educational and occupational
outcomes in science, technology, engineering, and math-
ematics among males, and with a higher likelihood of pur-
suing law degrees and medical degrees in females [27].
Academic performance and educational expectation have
also been negatively associated with a number of risky be-
haviors, such as cigarette smoking [28-31], alcohol drink-
ing [30,31], use of marijuana [30,31], early sexual initiation
[32] and violence [33,34]. Thus it is reasonable to
hypothesize that adolescents' academic performance and
educational aspiration might be related with birth out-
comes through behavioral intermediaries.
However, while there has been growing literature on
maternal educational attainment and birth outcomes
among adult mothers, less research has been conducted
exploring whether academic performance and educa-
tional aspiration influence birth outcomes among ado-
lescent mothers. Teen mothers have been found to have
poorer educational performance compared to other
teens [35,36]. This raises the question of a potential rela-
tionship between adolescents' academic performance,
educational aspiration and birth outcomes.
The purpose of the present study is to examine how ma-
ternal academic performance and educational aspiration
during adolescence are related to birth outcomes among
adolescent mothers. In addition, we examine whether
these relationships, if any, can be explained by maternal
smoking during pregnancy and utilization of prenatal care.
We use data from a nationally-representative survey of
school-attending youth who have completed their teenage
years and thus have complete data on teenage pregnan-
cies. Results will add to existing literature on the determi-
nants of birth outcomes among adolescents.
Methods
Data
Data from waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) contractual
dataset were utilized [37]. Add Health is a prospective
cohort study of a nationally-representative sample of
youth enrolled in grades 7-12 in the 1994-95 school year
(Wave I) [38]. Follow-up interviews were conducted in
1996 (Wave II), 2001 (Wave III), and 2007-08 (Wave
IV). A multistage probability clustered sampling design
was used to obtain its Wave I sample. The first stage
was a stratified, random sample of all public and private
high schools in the U.S. A feeder school was also re-
cruited from each participating community. In-school
surveys were attempted with all students attending par-
ticipating schools; a total of 90,118 were completed. In
the second Wave I sampling stage, a sample of adoles-
cents was drawn for in-depth in-home interviews, con-
sisting of a random core sample plus selected special
oversamples; a total of 20,745 interviews were conducted
at this stage. At Wave II, most students (except Wave I
seniors) were eligible for re-interview; at Waves III and
IV, all respondents to the Wave I in-home interview
were eligible for re-interview. A total of 15,701 inter-
views were conducted at Wave IV (80.3% response rate).
Sampling weights adjusted for both unequal probabilities
of selection into the original sample and for loss to
follow-up. The present study was deemed exempt by the
IRB at Tulane University.
We applied a number of sample inclusion criteria.
First, we limited to females who participated in Wave IV,
as that was the Wave when all respondents had com-
pleted their teenage years and had complete teen preg-
nancy data. Second, we limited to female participants
with valid sampling weights in order to make generaliza-
tions to the U.S. population. Third, we limited to females
whose first pregnancies occurred during adolescence,
after Wave I and ended with a singleton live birth to en-
sure the temporal ordering of predictors and outcomes
(n = 978). Finally, we limited to females with complete
information on all covariates. This left us with an ana-
lysis sample of 763 teen singleton live births.
Measures
Outcomes
At Wave IV girls were asked about previous pregnancies
and their outcomes. If they indicated they had given
birth, they were asked "How much did the baby weigh at
birth?", "Was [baby's name] born before or after [his/
her] due date?" and then "How many weeks or days
early/late was [baby's name] born?" This was subtracted
from 40 weeks to calculate gestational age. Birthweight
was examined in kilograms and gestational age was ex-
amined in weeks.

Predictors
Academic performance
We measured adolescents' grade point average (GPA)
based on their self-reported school performance in four
subjects in Wave I in-home interview: English or language
arts, mathematics, history or social studies, and science.
Letter grades of A, B, C, and D were coded as 4, 3, 2, and
1, respectively and were averaged and dichotomized at the
median (median = 2.5). In Wave I in-home interview ado-
lescents were also asked whether they had ever skipped a
grade [yes/no] and repeated a grade [yes/no].
Educational aspiration
Adolescents' educational aspiration was measured from
three questions in Wave I in-home interview asking how
much they wanted to go to college, how likely they were
to go to college, and how disappointed the adolescent
thought his/her mother would be if the adolescent did
not graduate from college. Responses were provided in a
5-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating higher
expectation or likelihood of going to college. Because of
the likely high correlation between these items, we con-
ducted a polychoric principal factor analysis with vari-
max rotation among the three questions, and the results
suggested a single-factor solution (factor loading: 0.74,
0.77, and 0.71, respectively). We then created the educa-
tional aspiration scale by summing the items weighted
by their factor loadings, with higher score indicating
higher aspiration for college education. In bivariate and
multivariable analyses, we standardized the score so that
the regression coefficients represent change in outcome
with a one-standard deviation change in the educational
aspiration score.
We examined correlation among all predictor variables
(i.e., GPA, grade skipping, grade repeating, and educa-
tional aspiration) and found low correlations, with poly-
choric correlation coefficients ranging from 0.01 to 0.34.
Mediators
Based on prior literature, we included measures of smok-
ing during pregnancy and timing of prenatal care visit as
potential mediators of maternal education variables and
birth outcomes. Smoking during pregnancy was assessed
at Wave IV for each pregnancy reported. Respondents
were asked to report on an ordinal scale how many ciga-
rettes they smoked during their pregnancy (none/a few
cigarettes but not every week/a few cigarettes a week but
not every day/10 or fewer a day/11-20 a day/21-30 a
day/31 or more a day). We dichotomized responses due
to sparseness across smoker frequencies in the sample.
The timing of prenatal care initiation was based on two
questions asked about each pregnancy reported at Wave
IV: "During this pregnancy with [partner] did you ever
visit a doctor, nurse-midwife or other health care
provider for prenatal care, that is, for one or more preg-
nancy check-ups?" and "How many weeks pregnant were
you at the time of your first prenatal care visit?" Re-
sponses to these two questions were combined and cate-
gorized into three groups: initiated in the first trimester;
initiated in the second trimester; and initiated in the
third trimester or no prenatal care.
Controls
We drew upon our previous analysis of predictors of birth
outcomes in this cohort to determine confounders [39]. This
analysis indicated effects of race, age at pregnancy, age at
Wave I, body mass index (BMI) categories and parental edu-
cation. Parental education was measured as the higher of ei-
ther co-residential mother or father: less than high school
diploma, high school diploma/GED or higher. BMI was cat-
egorized into four groups: underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2),
normal weight (18.5 kg/m2  BMI < 25.0 kg/m2), overweight
(25.0 kg/m2  BMI < 30.0 kg/m2), and obese (BMI  30.0
kg/m2) [40].
Analyses
All analyses were conducted in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary,
North Carolina) using survey procedures, which apply
population weights and adjust standard errors for non-
independence between respondents due to school-based
sampling. We began with descriptive statistics (means
and percentages) for all analysis variables, then con-
ducted bivariate analyses (t-test, ANOVA or linear re-
gression) to test the crude relationships between analysis
variables and birth outcomes. Finally, we implemented
multivariable linear regression models to examine the
relationship between maternal academic performance
and educational aspiration and birth outcomes after con-
trolling for other individual and family characteristics. For
each birth outcome (birthweight, gestational age), we ex-
amined two models: one without potential mediator vari-
ables and the other with potential mediators. Mediation
was assessed based on change in effect estimates after in-
clusion of the mediating variables [41]. Analyses were run
stratified on race (Black / non-Black) given prior literature
suggesting different associations between maternal educa-
tion and birth outcomes according to race [9]. Significance
testing was conducted at  = 0.05.
Results
The characteristics of the study population are presented
in Table 1. Average age at Wave I, when girls' academic
performance and educational aspiration were examined,
was about 15 for both Black and non-Black girls. This
was on average about two years before they gave birth.
Black adolescent mothers had lower birth weight and a
smaller proportion with GPA above median compared
with non-Black mothers. The educational aspiration was

higher in Black adolescents than in non-Black adoles-
cents. A larger proportion of non-Black girls ever
smoked during pregnancy than that in Black girls.
In bivariate analysis, none of the education variables
was significantly associated with offspring's birthweight
among Black adolescents while higher educational aspir-
ation and ever skipping a grade were related with higher
birthweight in non-Black adolescents. Smoking during
pregnancy was positively related with birth weight among
Black adolescents (Table 2). Ever skipping a grade was also
positively associated with offspring's gestational age in
non-Black girls. Smoking during pregnancy was associated
with higher gestational age among Black adolescents
(Table 3).
Multivariable analysis of birthweight is presented in
Table 4. Among Black adolescents, ever skipping a grade
was associated with 200 grams increase in their off-
spring's birthweight when controlling for other variables
(p = 0.04). Among non-Black adolescents, ever skipping
a grade and higher educational aspiration were associ-
ated with higher birthweight (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, re-
spectively). After adding the two potential mediators (i.
e., smoking during pregnancy and prenatal care visit),
the associations between the main predictors and birth-
weight remained largely the same, suggesting no medi-
ation (model 2, Table 4). However, smoking during
pregnancy was significantly positively associated with
birthweight in Black girls.

For gestational age (Table 5), none of the education
variables was significantly related to birth outcomes in
Black adolescent girls. Among non-Black adolescents,
those who ever skipped a grade had around one week in-
crease in offspring's gestational age (p = 0.03). The
addition of the two potential mediators did not change
the association between grade skipping and offspring's
gestational age. Similar to the bivariate analysis, smoking
during pregnancy was associated with increased gesta-
tional age among Black adolescents.
Post-hoc analysis
As our study sample is a selected one including females
whose first pregnancies occurred during adolescence
and ended with a singleton live birth, we were con-
cerned about potential sample selection biases that
might have influenced our findings. We did a post-hoc
analysis examining whether maternal academic perform-
ance and educational aspiration during adolescence pre-
dicted the likelihood of having teen pregnancy. Among
6,497 adolescent girls with valid sampling weight and
non-missing values on all covariates, 1,406 (21.64%) ever
had teen pregnancy. Among Black girls (n = 1,491),
below-average GPA was associated with a higher risk of
teen pregnancy (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.22, 95% Confi-
dence Interval [CI]: 1.51-3.26). Among non-Black girls
(n = 5,006), below-average GPA, ever skipping a grade,
and ever repeating a grade were related with a higher
likelihood of teen pregnancy (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.71-
2.57; OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.08-3.77; and OR = 1.63, 95% CI:
1.23-2.17, respectively); higher educational aspiration was
negatively associated with the risk of teen pregnancy.

Discussion
Educational goals and achievements are likely to be par-
ticularly important for adolescents, as school is their
major social and occupational context [42]. However,
most studies that linked maternal education with birth
outcomes used maternal educational attainment in
adulthood or at the child's birth [8-12,14]. Few studies
have explored whether academic performance and edu-
cational aspiration during adolescence are associated
with birth outcomes among adolescent mothers. In this
study, data were collected prospectively, which allowed
us to assess academic performance and educational as-
piration prior to the teen pregnancy.
Multivariable analysis indicated that higher aspiration
for college education was related to higher birthweight
among non-Black adolescents. Higher educational aspir-
ation could indicate a greater future orientation and
greater social support [43] which would be associated
with healthier pregnancies through health-protective be-
haviors, such as good nutrition and physical activity
[44]. On the other hand, girls who do not have high as-
piration for their educational futures may be reflecting a
family or community not generally supportive of the girl
or her goals, which might translate to reduced social
support during pregnancy [45]. It also might indicate
their life circumstances, which could include poor health
or a community that does not have many people going
to college [46,47]. This may be part of a fatalistic attitude
towards pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes, which
might lead to poorer self-care.
We found that grade skipping was associated with
higher birthweight and gestational age among non-Black
girls, as well as higher birthweight among Black girls.
Grade skipping is one way to accomplish the concept of

appropriate developmental placement [27,48]. It allows
intellectually precocious students to experience more
developmentally appropriate content by skipping over
what they have already known or can easily learn [49]. It
has been suggested to have merit as the intellectually tal-
ented students potentially gain intellectual development,
interpersonal maturity and time when they advance
more quickly through the educational system [27]. It is
possible that adolescents who were accelerated had
greater social support [50] and personal resilience and
thus have healthier lifestyles and behaviors during preg-
nancy which lead to better birth outcomes.
No statistically significant relationship was found be-
tween adolescents' GPA and either of the birth out-
comes. However, we observed that among non-Black
adolescents, those whose GPA was below average had
higher birthweight and gestational age than those with
GPA above average and the magnitude of the coeffi-
cients was larger than that for grade skipping. It is pos-
sible that this finding is (partly) due to the imperfect
measurement of adolescents' GPA; adolescents may have
mis-reported their letter grades in Wave I in-home
interview. Nonetheless, this was an unexpected finding.
We tested the interaction between GPA and grade skip-
ping, as well as interaction between GPA and grade re-
peating, to determine whether a low GPA represented
more challenging courses relative to age, but neither was
statistically significant (p > 0.05).
Past studies suggested that the effect of maternal edu-
cation on birth outcomes could be accounted for by the
health-related risk behaviors, particularly maternal smo-
king and alcohol use during pregnancy and late entry
into prenatal care [11,14,15,19]. However, in our study
the addition of smoking during pregnancy and prenatal

care visit did not change the regression coefficients of
the education variables, thus there was little evidence of
a mediating effect of these factors. Among Black girls,
we were unable to examine the mediating effect of alco-
hol use during pregnancy due to small cells (i.e. only
four girls ever used alcohol during pregnancy). Among
non-Black girls, the addition of alcohol use during preg-
nancy did not change the regression coefficients of the
education variables (See Additional file 1: Table S1). There
was no relationship between education variables and po-
tential mediator variables. It would be interesting to ex-
plore alternative pathways that might explain the effect of
adolescent educational aspiration and grade skipping on
birth outcomes.
Surprisingly, we found that smoking during pregnancy
was positively related to Black adolescent mothers'
birthweight and gestational age. This finding is inconsist-
ent with extensive literature documenting increased risk
of adverse birth outcomes with smoking during preg-
nancy [51]. It is possible that this unexpected result is
due to the very small number of Black adolescent
mothers who reported any smoking during pregnancy
(n = 14), which may lead to spurious results. It may also
be due to sample selection biases, since our sample was
limited to mothers who experienced a pregnancy as an
adolescent and had a singleton live birth, or reporting
biases. Given these potential issues with the ascertain-
ment of smoking during pregnancy, results should be
interpreted with caution.
In the post-hoc analysis, we found that lower GPA was
related with a higher risk of teen pregnancy in both
Black and non-Black girls, and that higher educational

aspiration was related with a lower risk of teen preg-
nancy in non-Black girls. Our findings were consistent
with existing literature which suggests that better grades
in school and/or higher educational aspirations are asso-
ciated with postponed sexual activities [52-55]. On the
other hand, Tucker et al. did not find a significant asso-
ciation between parental educational expectations and
teen pregnancy using data from Add Health [56]. How-
ever, the authors used parents' educational expectations
[56] while we examined adolescents' own educational as-
piration. Among non-Black girls, those who ever re-
peated a grade were more likely to experience teen
pregnancy. This is consistent with evidence from exist-
ing studies that students who are over-age for grade ex-
perience a higher level of emotional stress and more
behavioral problems, including substance abuse and
early sexual debut [57-59]. We found that grade skipping
was related with a higher risk of having teen pregnancy
among non-Black girls, which is an unexpected finding.
There were 24 non-Black girls who ever skipped a grade
and had teen pregnancy. With this relatively small cell
size, the possibility that this finding is due to chance
cannot be ruled out. These results suggest that adoles-
cent girls' academic performance and educational aspir-
ation influence both the likelihood of getting pregnant
as a teenager and birth outcomes of teenage pregnancy.
Our findings suggest that interventions that affect ado-
lescents' educational aspirations and grade acceleration
might have positive effects on birth outcomes should the
adolescent become pregnant. It has been found that both
personal and social attributes are important factors that
influence educational aspiration and grade acceleration
in adolescent students [47,60,61]. Adolescents' liking
and enjoyment of school as well as a sense of affinity in-
creases the probability of putting further education into
the plan. A friendly atmosphere at school and perceived
support from parents are also influential with regard to
adolescents' educational motivation [61]. Wells et al.
[50] found that children with parents who more often
discuss school programs, school activities, and things
studied in class were more likely to have grade acceler-
ation. Thus, the development of a supportive family and
school environment is important in stimulating educa-
tional aspiration and promoting academic performance,
which also has the benefit of being positively associated
with birth outcomes among adolescent mothers. In
addition, efforts should be made to identify and place
students in appropriate learning environment/grades
[27,50].
Our study used a large, nationally-representative data-
set. Measurement of exposures was made prior to out-
come data, which allows for the temporal inference
between academic performance and educational expect-
ation and the birth outcomes. Despite these strengths,
our study has several limitations. First, we used adoles-
cents' self-reported letter grades rather than school tran-
script, which would have provided a more accurate and
reliable measure of adolescents' academic performance.
The measurement of grade retention was also subject to
reporting bias. Second, we reduced our sample size by
requiring complete covariate data, which could bias our
study results. Analyses comparing included (n = 763)
versus excluded (n = 215) adolescents indicated no sig-
nificant difference in birthweight (p = 0.71), gestational
age (p = 0.62), race (p = 0.10), age at pregnancy (p =
0.16), parental education (p = 0.10), GPA (p = 0.41),
grade skipping (p = 0.20), adolescents' educational aspir-
ation (p = 0.15), smoking during pregnancy (p = 0.47),
and prenatal care visit (p = 0.17). However, there were
significant differences in baseline age (15.33 Â± 0.14 vs.
15.91 Â± 0.20 in included and excluded sample, respect-
ively; p < 0.001), baseline BMI (22.07 Â± 0.19 vs. 22.94 Â±
0.44 in included and excluded sample, respectively; p =
0.03), and percent of grade repeating (20.18% vs. 38.35%
in included and excluded sample, respectively; p < 0.001).
Third, we relied on maternal self-reports of both birth-
weight and gestational age, which may be subject to re-
call biases. However, past studies comparing birth
records to maternal self-report have found maternal re-
ports of birth outcomes are largely a valid method of
obtaining data [62].
Conclusions
In summary, we found that grade skipping was associ-
ated with higher offspring's birthweight among Black ad-
olescents, and with higher birthweight and gestational
age among non-Black adolescents. Higher educational
aspiration was associated with higher birthweight among
non-Black adolescents. Future research that explores the
pathways by which educational aspiration and grade
skipping influence birth outcomes among adolescent
mothers could add to our understanding of the determi-
nants of outcomes of teen births. As is reflected in the
new Healthy People 2020 goals related to adolescent
success in school, a partnership between adolescent-
serving clinicians, public health entities, and educational
institutions is warranted to improve the well-being of
both pregnant and non-pregnant adolescents.
