Physical activity has positive impacts on health (Department
of Health, 2011). It is especially important for older adults,
who are at risks of chronic disease (Department of Health,
2011) and isolation (Age, 2010). For older adults, walking is
an excellent type of physical activity (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 1999; Cunningham & Michael,
2004). As Broderick, McCullagh, White, Savage, and
Timmons (2015) have reported, walking and being able to
spend time outdoors is very important for older adults.
Outdoor walking (total walking for transport, recreation, and
exercise in outdoor space) reduces risks of chronic disease
(e.g., diabetes II and stroke) and improves social interactions
(Lee & Buchner, 2008; Sugiyama & Thompson, 2007). Thus,
development of interventions aiming at encouraging older
adults to take outdoor walks has been recommended
(Department of Health, 2011). Addressing outdoor walking is
especially important for urban planning discipline, because
outdoor walking takes place in outdoor spaces such as urban
streets and urban open spaces. One of the aims of a healthy
urban planning is encouraging outdoor walking among all
people (Barton & Tsourou, 2000; World Health Organization
[WHO], 2011). Great health benefits could be obtained by
encouraging older adults who are less active--and, therefore,
are more at risks of health problems--than others (Hillsdon,
Lawlor, Ebrahim, & Morris, 2008). Reducing inactivity and
eliminating disparities in physical activity are important pub-
lic policy priorities (Healthy People, 2006; Public Health
England, 2014; Ruseski, 2014). Therefore, it is necessary to
examine disparities in older adults' outdoor walking levels
and to identify less active groups of older adults.
Evidence indicates a socioeconomic deprivation gradient
in older adults' health (Grundy & Sloggett, 2003; Lima-
Costa, De, Oliveira, Macinko, & Marmot, 2012) and health
behavior (e.g., healthy eating; Bianchetti, Rozzini,
Carabellese, Zanetti, & Trabucchi, 1990; Conklin et al.,
2014; Conklin, Forouhi, Surtees, Wareham, & Monsivais,
2015). Socioeconomic deprivation is defined as relative dis-
advantage in terms of social and material resources
(Crampton, Salmond, Woodward, & Reid, 2000). It has been

The Associations Between Area
Deprivation and Objectively Measured
Older Adults' Outdoor Walking Levels
Razieh Zandieh1, Javier Martinez1, Johannes Flacke1,
and Martin van Maarseveen1
Abstract
Outdoor walking has positive impacts on older adults' health. It is crucial to identify less active older adults and to encourage
them to take outdoor walks. Previous studies have shown that physical activity levels vary according to socioeconomic
deprivation. However, knowledge on objectively measured older adults' outdoor walking levels is limited. This study
investigated associations between area (socioeconomic) deprivation and older adults' objectively (geographic positioning
system [GPS]) measured outdoor walking levels (i.e., walking durations and frequencies) in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
It used a multilevel approach. The final sample included 173 participants (65 years and above). A questionnaire was used to
collect data on personal characteristics (e.g., educational attainment as a proxy of individual deprivation, age, and marital
status). The results show that independent of personal characteristics, area deprivation associates with outdoor walking
durations. Participants from high-deprivation areas spend less time for outdoor walking than those from low-deprivation
areas. Associations between area deprivation and outdoor walking frequencies were nonsignificant. Future research needs
to investigate how attributes (e.g., environmental attributes) of low- and high-deprivation areas drive disparities in outdoor
walking durations among older residents of low- and high-deprivation areas.

shown that high socioeconomic deprivation increases risks
of chronic disease associated with low level of outdoor walk-
ing (e.g., cognitive function, Lang et al., 2008; diabetes II,
Espelt et al., 2011; and stroke, Cox, McKevitt, Rudd, &
Wolfe, 2006). These findings raise a hypothesis that older
adults' outdoor walking levels vary according to socioeco-
nomic deprivation. The issue of socioeconomic deprivation
has been addressed in previous studies on physical activity
levels (Gidlow, Johnston, Crone, Ellis, & James, 2006).
However, knowledge on associations between socioeco-
nomic deprivation and older adults' outdoor walking levels
(especially objectively measured outdoor walking levels) is
limited. Thus, this study addresses this hypothesis by focus-
ing on associations between area (socioeconomic) depriva-
tion and older adults' objectively measured outdoor walking
levels.
Area Deprivation
Evidence indicates that two levels of socioeconomic depri-
vation may associate with physical activity levels (Gidlow
et al., 2006; McNeill, Kreuter, & Subramanian, 2006): (a)
individual deprivation, that refers to an individual's disad-
vantage in terms of material welfare and the ability to partici-
pate in social life (Communities and Local Government,
2010)--common proxies of individual deprivation are edu-
cational attainment, income, and occupational status
(McNeill et al., 2006); and (b) area deprivation, that refers to
relative disadvantage of urban areas in which people live.
Area deprivation is usually measured as "a composite of fac-
tors relating to the economic, health, education, safety, hous-
ing, environmental, and social capital aspects of life for
residents of particular areas" (Communities and Local
Government, 2010, p. 12). Although area deprivation largely
includes individual residents' characteristics, such as indi-
vidual deprivation, it can also involve measurements related
to environmental conditions (Communities and Local
Government, 2010), such as quality of housing (McLennan
et al., 2011).
Most previous studies on physical activity have focused
on associations between individual deprivation and levels of
physical activity (Beenackers et al., 2012; Ford et al., 1991;
Gidlow et al., 2006). They have found the most stable asso-
ciations between physical activity levels and educational
attainment (Gidlow et al., 2006). Although previous research
has reported inconsistent results on total physical activity
levels (Beenackers et al., 2012), they have shown lower
prevalence of leisure-time physical activity among people
with high individual deprivation than among those with low
individual deprivation (Beenackers et al., 2012; Gidlow
et al., 2006). These findings indicate that physical activity
promotion interventions targeting highly deprived individu-
als are needed.
Recently, multilevel research on physical activity have
involved both, individual and area, levels of deprivation
(Hillsdon et al., 2008; Shishehbor, Gordon-Larsen, Kiefe, &
Litaker, 2008; Turrell et al., 2010). These studies have shown
that independent of individual deprivation, area deprivation
associates with physical activity levels. Findings of previous
research indicate that residents of high-deprivation areas are
more likely to have lower physical activity levels than resi-
dents of low-deprivation areas (Gidlow et al., 2006;
Kavanagh et al., 2005; Turrell et al., 2010; Wen, Browning,
& Cagney, 2007). It is crucial to address the associations
between area deprivation and physical activity levels,
because an area may contain a large number of people. It is
known that interventions targeting individuals are costly and
difficult to implement and, thus, area-level interventions that
encourage a larger number of people to do physical activity
could be targeted (Gidlow et al., 2006). Most of past multi-
level research, however, has addressed adults' population
(Kavanagh et al., 2005; Wen et al., 2007) or older adults'
total physical activity (Hillsdon et al., 2008). Multilevel
studies examining associations between area deprivation and
older adults' outdoor walking levels are scarce.
Objectively Measured Outdoor
Walking Levels
Some previous studies on older adults' walking levels have
addressed area deprivation (Fisher, Li, Michael, &
Cleveland, 2004; Fox et al., 2011). However, these studies
have typically relied on self-reported measurement of older
adults' outdoor walking levels (Fisher et al., 2004; Zandieh,
Martinez, Flacke, & van Maarseveen, 2015), which is virtu-
ally not an accurate measurement of physical activity levels
and is subject to recall bias (Gidlow et al., 2006; Harris
et al., 2009; Sims, Smith, Duffy, & Hilton, 1999). Fox et al.
(2011) have used accelerometers to measure walking levels
objectively. However, they have not focused on objectively
measured outdoor walking levels, probably because accel-
erometers cannot capture the locations in which walking
takes place--indoor or outdoor spaces (Cho, Rodriguez, &
Evenson, 2011). For measuring outdoor walking levels
objectively, using geographic positioning system (GPS)
technology has been suggested (Duncan & Mummery,
2007; Gernigon et al., 2015; Le Faucheur et al., 2007; Le
Faucheur et al., 2008; Taylor, Fitzsimons, & Mutrie, 2010).
The GPS technology provides accurate data on the location,
time, and speed of walking (Gong, Chen, Bialostozky, &
Lawson, 2012), and reduces the problems associated with
the self-report survey methods (Forrest & Pearson, 2005;
Murakami, Taylor, Wolf, Slavin, & Winick, 2004).Although
this technology has been used in previous studies on active
transport (Dessing, de Vries, Graham, & Pierik, 2014) and
environmental health (Harrison, Burgoine, Corder, van
Sluijs, & Jones, 2014), it has been rarely used in research
on older adults'walking. Therefore, this study uses the GPS
technology, applies a multilevel approach, and aims to
investigate the associations between area deprivation and
older adults' objectively measured outdoor walking levels.
Similar to previous research on physical activity (Fox et al.,
Zandieh et al. 3
2011; Kavanagh et al., 2005), in addition to area and indi-
vidual deprivations, this study includes older adults'
sociodemographic status (e.g., age, marital status, and eth-
nicity) and health status because these personal characteris-
tics may influence people's physical activity levels (Chad
et al., 2005; Fishman, Böcker, & Helbich, 2015; Slater,
Full, Fitzgibbon, & Uskali, 2015). To operationalize the
notion of outdoor walking levels, this study uses two indi-
cators that have been used in previous research on walking
(Cerin, Leslie, & Owen, 2009; Davis et al., 2011; Kavanagh
et al., 2005; Turrell et al., 2010) and have been addressed in
physical activity guidelines (WHO, 2010): (a) duration,
which refers to the length of time in which outdoor walking
is performed; and (b) frequency, which refers to the number
of times that outdoor walking is performed (WHO, 2010).
Accordingly, this study answers two research questions:
Research Question 1: What is the association between
area deprivation and older adults' outdoor walking
durations?
Research Question 2: What is the association between
area deprivation and older adults' outdoor walking
frequencies?
Method
We conducted this empirical research in Birmingham, United
Kingdom, from July 7, 2012, until October 31, 2012.
Birmingham is a large, ethnically diverse city in the West
Midlands of England (Birmingham City Council, 2013,
2014). With a population of more than 1,000,000 residents,
Birmingham has been known as the most populous British
city outside London (City Mayors, 2010).
The ethical approval for this study was received from
University of Birmingham's Humanities and Social Sciences
(HASS) Ethical Review Committee.
Distinguishing Low- and High-Deprivation Areas
Similar to other studies (Hillsdon et al., 2008), we identified
low- and high-deprivation areas (wards). To do so, we used
the index of multiple deprivation (IMD; Zandieh, Martinez,
Flacke, Jones, & van Maarseveen, 2016). The IMD is an
indicator that provides an accepted measure of area depriva-
tion in the United Kingdom (Communities and Local
Government, 2010). It involves seven domains of depriva-
tion, such as education, income, and crime (McLennan et al.,
2011), and determines a score of relative deprivation of each
lower super output area (LSOA)--defined as a relatively
homogeneous geographic area with a population of about
1,500 residents (Communities and Local Government, 2010;
Office for National Statistics, 2014).
We identified the 20% least and 20% most deprived
LSOAs of Birmingham by using IMD quintiles. Then, we
identified a ward as a relatively low-deprivation area, if more
than 50% of its area was covered by the 20% least deprived
LSOAs. Similarly, a ward was identified as a relatively high-
deprivation area, if more than 50% of its area was covered by
the 20% most deprived LSOAs. As a result, low-deprivation
areas (four wards) were identified in northern part of
Birmingham and high-deprivation areas (four wards) were
identified in inner part of Birmingham (Figure 1). We used
these selected wards for participant recruitment (Zandieh
et al., 2016).
Participant Recruitment
We applied a convenience sampling strategy for participant
recruitment in both low- and high-deprivation areas.
Applying this sampling strategy is often the norm in studies
on health behavior (Gochman, 1997, cited in Newsom,
Kaplan, Huguet, & McFarland, 2004), particularly in
research on older adults (Newsom et al., 2004). We recruited
participants from social centers (e.g., community centers,
worship centers) located in low- and high-deprivation areas
(all eight selected wards). By posting advertisements, we
informed participants about the research, and by arranging
information sessions, we provided information on the pro-
cess of participation in research. To explain the research to
non­English-speaking older adults, we used a translator
(Zandieh et al., 2016).
Eligible participants were those older adults (65 years or
above) who were (a) residing in a (low- or) high-deprivation
area, (b) capable to walk, (c) autonomous in their daily activ-
ities, and (d) mentally healthy (Zandieh et al., 2016). English
speaking was not an inclusion criterion. We screened partici-
pants for their ethnicity. To reach maximum similarity to eth-
nical heterogeneity in the total population of the selected
wards, we applied quota sampling and mirrored proportions
of diverse ethnicities found in census 2001--the latest avail-
able census (Zandieh et al., 2016). Two hundred sixteen par-
ticipants received GPS tracking units. We excluded 43
participants who forgot to use the GPS tracking unit when
they went out of their homes or refused to use the tracking
unit after receiving it. However, we included participants
who accepted (and remembered) to use the tracking units
(after receiving it), but they did not walk outside their homes.
Therefore, the final sample included 93 participants from
low-deprivation areas and 80 participants from high-depriva-
tion areas (173 participants in total). All participants signed a
consent form before participation in this study.
Measuring Outdoor Walking Durations and
Frequencies
We used a GPS tracking unit--the i-gotU GT-600 GPS data
logger from Mobile Action Technologies--to measure par-
ticipants' outdoor walking durations and frequencies. This
tracking unit had been used in other studies (Belkin et al.,
2014; Ben-Pazi, Barzilay, & Shoval, 2013; Naito, Uesaka,
Yamada, & Ishii, 2014; Seto et al., 2012; Vazquez-Prokopec
et al., 2013). It is small, portable, and light; has a motion
4 SAGE Open
detector; needs least involvement by participants, and, there-
fore, is suitable to use with older adults (Vazquez-Prokopec
et al., 2009; Zandieh et al., 2016). Furthermore, this tracking
unit has good reliability and spatial accuracy in urban areas
(Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2009). We also tested the spatial
accuracy of this device in different parts of Birmingham and
it was fit for our purpose.
We set the tracking units on motion detector mode and on
2-s recording interval and, then, we gave them to participants
from low- and high-deprivation areas. In terms of time, the
tracking units were distributed in parallel (simultaneously) in
low- and high-deprivation areas during data collection
period; therefore, atmospheric conditions were similar for
participants from low- and high-deprivation areas. We
trained participants how to use the tracking units and we pro-
vided written and oral instructions for them. Participants
agreed to wear a tracking unit on their wrists when they went
out of their homes. Depending on participants' willingness
and availability, participants used the tracking units for a
period of 3 to 8 days (average = 4.95 days, SD = 1.61 days;
Zandieh et al., 2016).
We collected the tracking units 1 day after the lending
period and asked participants some questions about using the
tracking unit during the lending period. For example, we
asked participants whether they refused to use the tracking
unit after receiving it and how many days they forgot to take
the tracking unit. Thus, we could exclude participants who
changed their minds and refused to use (or forgot to use) the
tracking unit after receiving it. By using GPS technology,
data on the location (x, y), date, speed, and time of partici-
pants' trips were provided.
We imported GPS data in a Geographic Information
System (GIS)--Arc GIS 10.3.1 (Environmental Systems
Research Institute [ESRI])--and overlaid the recorded tracks
with streets and buildings. We took all trips taken place
inside Birmingham into account for further analysis. By
using data on date, we identified daily trips for each partici-
pant. Then, we applied criteria on identifying walking trips
using GPS data (Cho et al., 2011) and identified daily out-
door walking trips (Zandieh et al., 2016). For measurement,
we considered all outdoor walking trips, including (a) walk-
ing started from home and ended in a destination (or in home

in a round trip), for example, walking from home to a shop
(or walking around a block); and (b) walking followed a trip
by car/public transport and ended in a destination (or in an
origin in a round trip), for example, getting of a bus and
walking from bus stop to a shop (or getting of a car and walk-
ing around a block/park and getting on a car). We calculated
average outdoor walking duration (minutes per day) for each
participant by using this formula: (Total duration of all daily
outdoor walking trips) / (The period: number of days that
participant was loaned the tracking unit; Zandieh et al.,
2016). To measure outdoor walking frequency, we counted
number of all outdoor walking trips for each participant.
Individual-Level Data: Personal Characteristics
To collect data on individual level, we used a self-adminis-
tered paper questionnaire. For non­English-speaking partici-
pants or participants who needed assistance in completing
the questionnaire (n = 58), we used a translator/assistant. In
this way, we collected data on participants' educational
attainment (sub­General Certificates of Secondary Education
[GCSE] or its equivalents) vs. GCSE and higher) as a proxy
of individual deprivation. We also collected data on partici-
pants' age (65-74 years old vs. 75 years old and above), gen-
der (man or woman), marital status (single vs. in relationship),
and ethnicity (Black and minority ethnic [BME] groups--
including Asian, Black, or mixed ethnic heritage--or White
British; Roe, Aspinall, & Ward Thompson, 2016). Data on
perceived health status over the last 12 months (poor or
good) were also collected (Zandieh et al., 2016).
Participants' income was not involved in this study,
because in Britain, people are sensitive to income-related
information and these data are rarely collected (Gidlow et al.,
2006). Moreover, because the sample includes retired peo-
ple, occupational status was not used as a proxy of individual
deprivation. Missing data were less than 5% on each partici-
pant's characteristic (except 11% missing data on educa-
tional attainment).
Data Analysis
To analyze sample characteristics, we used descriptive statis-
tics. We examined spatial distributions of data on outdoor
walking durations and frequencies. For this purpose, we
applied ArcGIS 10.3.1 and we used the Jenks Natural Breaks
classification method to classify data on outdoor walking
durations and frequencies into three classes (e.g., high,
medium and low). "The Jenks Natural Breaks classification
method is a data classification method designed to determine
the best arrangement of values into different classes"
(Stefanidis & Stathis, 2013, p. 574). It is done by reducing
the variance within classes and maximizing the variance
between classes (Stefanidis & Stathis, 2013).
We studied associations between area deprivation and out-
door walking durations and frequencies by generating
bivariate and multiple models. Outdoor walking durations and
frequencies were examined separately. For outdoor walking
durations, we generated linear regression models. To improve
normality, we used logarithmic-transformed variables (x + 1).
For outdoor walking frequencies, because we had count data,
we generated negative binomial models, and used the number
of walking trips as dependent variable and the logarithmic-
transformed number of days (GPS lending period) as an offset
variable. We applied multiple models after testing bivariate
correlations between all independent variables (area depriva-
tion and personal characteristics): The maximum Pearson cor-
relation, rmax
(153)between area deprivation and educational attainment
= -.63,
p = .000, was acceptable for generating multiple models.
We, first, examined associations between personal char-
acteristics and outdoor walking durations/frequencies for
low- and high-deprivation areas, separately. We tested bivar-
iate associations between personal characteristics and out-
door walking durations/frequencies in low- and
high-deprivation areas. Then, we generated multiple models:
We entered all personal characteristics at once and we
dropped the least significant (in terms of t value/Wald chi-
square value) predictors to get the model of best fit.
Afterward, we did analyses for total sample (low- and high-
deprivation areas). We tested bivariate associations between
independent variables (area deprivation and personal charac-
teristics) and outdoor walking durations/frequencies.
Afterward, we used hierarchical analyses. We generated two
multiple models: In Model 1, we entered only two indepen-
dent variables related to deprivation (i.e., area deprivation
and educational attainment); and in Model 2, we entered all
independent variables (i.e., area deprivation, educational
attainment, age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, and health
status) at once, and then we dropped the least significant (in
terms of t value/Wald chi-square value) predictors (except
area deprivation) to get the final model (the model of best
fit). We controlled the final models for interactions between
area deprivation and personal characteristics that were asso-
ciated with outdoor walking levels in low- or in high-depri-
vation areas.
In all models, we excluded missing data listwise. We
conducted all analyses by using IBM SPSS Statistics
22 and we considered a p < .05 significant. The average
GPS lending period (number of days) was not signifi-
cantly different between low- and high-deprivation areas
(p = .94).
Results
Sample Characteristics
A summary of the sample characteristics is presented in
Table 1. As this table shows, higher percent of participants
from BME groups and higher percent of participants with
low educational attainment (sub-GCSE) reside in high-depri-
vation areas. It also shows that more than 90% of participants
6 SAGE Open
perceived good health status. This trend was similar in low-
and high-deprivation areas.
Spatial Distribution Pattern of Outdoor Walking
Distribution patterns of participants'outdoor walking durations
and frequencies in low- and high-deprivation areas are pre-
sented in Figure 2. As Figure 2A shows, minimum and maxi-
mum participants' outdoor walking durations are 0.00 and
69.40 min per day. Moreover, minimum and maximum partici-
pants' outdoor walking frequencies are 0.00 and 38.00 trips
(Figure 2B). On average, participants living in high-depriva-
tion areas spend less time for outdoor walking than their peers
living in low-deprivation areas. Moreover, whereas low out-
door walking frequency is more prevalent among participants
from high-deprivation areas, medium walking frequency is
more prevalent among participants from low-deprivation areas.
The percentage of participants with high outdoor walking fre-
quencies, however, is higher in high-deprivation areas than in
low-deprivation areas. Detailed results on associations between
area deprivation and outdoor walking durations/frequencies are
presented later in this article.
Associations Between Personal Characteristics
and Outdoor Walking Durations and Frequencies
in Low- and High-Deprivation Areas
Table 2 represents bivariate associations between personal
characteristics and outdoor walking durations and frequencies
in low- and high-deprivation areas. As this table shows, only
marital status is independently associated with outdoor walk-
ing durations in low-deprivation areas.
Table 3 shows the results of multiple models. It represents
associations between personal characteristics and outdoor
walking durations and frequencies in low- and high-depriva-
tion areas after dropping the least significant predictors. In
low-deprivation areas, only one personal characteristic (i.e.,
marital status) is associated with outdoor walking durations.
None of personal characteristics was associated with outdoor
walking frequencies in low-deprivation areas. Personal char-
acteristics were not associated with outdoor walking dura-
tions and outdoor walking frequencies in high-deprivation
areas. These results (Table 3) were used later for controlling
interactions between personal characteristics and area depri-
vation in total sample.
Associations Between Area Deprivation and
Outdoor Walking Durations and Frequencies in
Total Sample
Bivariate associations of area deprivation and personal char-
acteristics with outdoor walking durations and frequencies
are presented in Table 4. This table shows that area depriva-
tion is independently associated only with outdoor walking
durations. These results indicate that participants residing in
high-deprivation areas take shorter outdoor walks than those
residing in low-deprivation areas. Three personal characteris-
tics (i.e., educational attainment, marital status, and ethnicity)

are independently related to outdoor walking durations.
Bivariate associations between area deprivation, as well as
personal characteristics, and outdoor walking frequencies
were nonsignificant.
Table 5 represents the results of hierarchical analyses. As
this table shows, area deprivation is associated with outdoor
walking durations after adjustment for educational attain-
ment (Model 1). Area deprivation is also associated with out-
door walking durations, after including all personal
characteristics and dropping the least significant predictors
(Model 2). In addition to area deprivation, marital status is
associated with outdoor walking durations (Model 2).
Therefore, participants who live in high-deprivation areas--
as well as participants who are single--are more likely to
take shorter outdoor walks.
Because marital status was associated with outdoor walk-
ing durations in low-deprivation areas (Table 3), we con-
trolled Model 2 for interactions between area deprivation and
this personal characteristic (i.e., marital status). The interac-
tion between area deprivation and marital status was not
related to outdoor walking durations (Table 5). Moreover,
associations of area deprivation and marital status with out-
door walking durations remained significant after adjustment
for this interaction (i.e., Area deprivation × Marital status).
As Table 5 shows, area deprivation combined with per-
sonal characteristics is not related to outdoor walking fre-
quencies (Model 1 and Model 2). Therefore, participants'
outdoor walking frequencies do not significantly differ
between low- and high-deprivation areas. None of the per-
sonal characteristics was associated with outdoor walking
frequencies (Table 5, Model 1 and Model 2).
Discussion
This study used GPS technology and examined associations
between area deprivation and older adults' objectively mea-
sured outdoor walking levels (i.e., durations and frequencies)
in Birmingham, United Kingdom. In this study, we showed
that independent of personal characteristics, area deprivation
associates with participants' outdoor walking durations.
Discussion on the findings of this study is provided in the
following subsections.
Outdoor Walking Durations
We found that participants residing in high-deprivation areas
spend less time for outdoor walking than their peers residing
in low-deprivation areas. This finding is consistent with find-
ings of a previous study examining self-reported outdoor

walking durations among adults (Turrell et al., 2010). It is
also in line with results of a previous U.K. study on associa-
tions between area deprivation and older adults' walking
using accelerometer (Fox et al., 2011). Moreover, it supports
findings of past research on physical activity indicating
higher prevalence of inactivity in high-deprivation areas than
in low-deprivation areas (Hillsdon et al., 2008; Kavanagh
et al., 2005; Turrell et al., 2010).
We also found that one personal characteristic (i.e., mari-
tal status) is related to outdoor walking durations (Table 5).
Single participants take shorter outdoor walks than those
who are in relationship. It is likely that participants who are
in relationship enjoy benefits of their spouses'/partners' sup-
ports and encouragements and take longer outdoor walks
(Booth, Owen, Bauman, Clavisi, & Leslie, 2000; McNeill
et al., 2006). The interaction between area deprivation and
marital status was not related to outdoor walking durations.
It means that associations between area deprivation and out-
door walking durations (Table 5, Model 2) are not moderated
by personal characteristics (i.e., marital status). Therefore,
area deprivation associates with outdoor walking durations,
independent of personal characteristics.
In this study, educational attainment was only indepen-
dently associated with outdoor walking durations (Table 4).
The strength of this predictor decreased when it was com-
bined with area deprivation and other individual characteris-
tics (Table 5, Model 1 and Model 2).
Outdoor Walking Frequencies
We did not find significant associations between area depri-
vation and outdoor walking frequencies. These findings are
inconsistent with findings of this study on outdoor walking
durations. These inconsistencies may be explained by type of
outdoor walking trips. For example, a round trip in a park or
around a block is counted as one trip frequency, but it results
in a long outdoor walking duration. A single trip from home
to a close shop is also counted as one trip frequency, but it
results in a short walking duration. Therefore, the number of
times that outdoor walking is performed does not differ
between low- and high-deprivation areas, but the length of
time spent for outdoor walking varies between these areas.
Findings of this study on outdoor walking frequencies are
also inconsistent with a previous study showing association
between area deprivation and frequency of walking for trans-
port among adults (Cerin et al., 2009). This inconsistency
may be explained by differences in outdoor walking mea-
sures. In this study, we used a composite measure of total
outdoor walking levels (walking for transport, recreation,
and exercise). We did not classify outdoor walking durations/
frequencies by walking purposes because of lack of data on
outdoor walking purposes. It is possible that area deprivation
has a differential impact on durations/frequencies of outdoor
walking for different purposes. Studies on adults' population
that differentiate between walking purposes have shown that
compared with residents of low-deprivation areas, residents
of high-deprivation areas more tend to walk for transport
(Turrell et al., 2010) and less tend to walk for exercise/recre-
ation (van Lenthe, Brug, & Mackenbach, 2005). Future stud-
ies on older adults may involve outdoor walking purposes
and may investigate associations between area deprivation
and objectively measured durations and frequencies of out-
door walking for different purposes.
Application of the Findings
Findings of this study indicate that area-level interventions--
as well as individual-level interventions--that encourage
participants to take longer outdoor walks could be targeted.
However, the content of such area-level interventions are not
clear and require further research. Although this study identi-
fied disparities in participants' (objectively measured) out-
door walking durations between low- and high-deprivation
areas, it did not examine the reasons behind these disparities,
because this issue is out of the scope of this study. Future
studies may investigate how different attributes of low- and
high-deprivation areas may drive disparities in older adults'
outdoor walking durations.
Past research has shown that environmental attributes
(e.g., land use mix and safety) may influence people's physi-
cal activity (Haselwandter et al., 2015; Khreis, van Nunen,
Mueller, Zandieh, & Nieuwenhuijsen, 2017; Saelens, Sallis,
Black, & Chen, 2003), such as walking (Haselwandter et al.,
2015; Saelens & Handy, 2008). Associations between area
deprivation and outdoor walking levels may be a sign of dif-
ferent influences of environmental attributes on participants'
outdoor walking durations in low- and high-deprivation
areas. Findings of this study pave the way for future research
to develop a hypothesis on impacts of environmental attri-
butes of low- and high-deprivation areas on disparities in
older adults' outdoor walking durations. This research may
investigate what environmental attributes influence older
adults' outdoor walking durations in low- and high-depriva-
tion areas and how.
Limitations
We acknowledge that this study has some limitations. Because
it is a cross-sectional study, it cannot provide cause-and-effect
statements on associations. Moreover, it involves one proxy of
individual deprivation (i.e., educational attainment). Lack of
data on participants' income, as well as other income-related
proxies (e.g., household income) prevented this study from
involving income as a proxy of individual deprivation.
Although previous studies have found "educational attain-
ment" as a stable predictor of physical activity (Gidlow et al.,
2006), involving "income" may add more information about
associations between area deprivation and physical activity
levels. Future studies may improve knowledge on associations
10 SAGE Open
between areas deprivation and older adults' objectively mea-
sured outdoor walking levels by involving educational attain-
ment and other proxies of individual deprivation (e.g.,
income). Moreover, this study addresses participants' health
status, but it does not specifically involve perceived walking
difficulties (e.g., knee pain) or use of walking aids due to lack
of data.
This study was conducted in one British city and used a
convenience sampling strategy for participants' recruitment.
Older adults who participated in this study may not represent
all older residents of low- and high-deprivation areas, par-
ticularly older residents with perceived poor health status.
Moreover, this study could involve two categories of areas
(low- and high-deprivation areas). Future research may use a
larger and more heterogeneous (in terms of health status)
sample and may identify variations in older adults' outdoor
walking levels between more categories of areas (e.g., low-,
medium-, and high-deprivation areas).
Despite these limitations, the findings of this study on
lower levels of outdoor walking among participants residing
in high-deprivation areas versus participants residing in low-
deprivation areas is consistent with the findings of previous
multilevel studies on physical activity (Fox et al., 2011;
Gidlow et al., 2006; Kavanagh et al., 2005). This provides
some evidence that the results of this study may not be
unique to this sample in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Conclusion
This study extends the knowledge on associations between
area deprivation and physical activity and adds to the litera-
ture on older adults' objectively measured walking levels.
This study is one of the first evidence on older adults' out-
door walking using a multilevel approach and GPS technol-
ogy. It shows that objectively measured participants'outdoor
walking levels (i.e., durations) vary by area deprivation:
Participants residing in high-deprivation areas spend less
time for outdoor walking than those residing in low-depriva-
tion areas. This research confirms past research showing
negative associations between area deprivation and physical
activity levels. Area-level interventions may help to reduce
negative impacts of multiple deprivation on older adults'out-
door walking durations. However, the content of these inter-
ventions are not clear and require further research. This study
sets the ground for future research to investigate how attri-
butes (e.g., environmental attributes) of low- and high-depri-
vation areas may give rise to disparities in participants'
outdoor walking durations.
