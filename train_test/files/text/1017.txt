Objective: To examine whether measures of neighbourhood economic deprivation, social disorganisation,
and acculturation explain homicide mortality differentials between Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic
black Americans, and non-Hispanic white Americans, net of individual factors.
Design: Prospective study, National Health Interview Survey (1986­1994) linked to subsequent mortality
in the National Death Index (1986­1997).
Setting: United States of America.
Participants: A nationally representative sample of non-institutionalised Mexican Americans, non-
Hispanic black Amricans, and non-Hispanic white Americans, aged 18­50 at the point of interview.
Analysis: Cox proportional hazard models estimate the risk of death associated with various
neighbourhood and individual factors.
Main results: Both individual and neighbourhood risk factors partially account for race/ethnic disparities
in homicide. Homicide mortality risks are between 20% and 50% higher for residents of areas that have
economic inequality of 0.50 or greater based on the coefficient of variation, or where 4% or more of the
residents are Mexican American, 10% or more of the residents are non-Hispanic black, or 20% or more of
the households are headed by single parents (p(.05). But residents of areas where 10% or more of their
neighbours are foreign born have 35% lower mortality risks than people living in areas with fewer foreign
born people (p(0.05). These differences persist even after controlling for individual level risk factors.
Conclusions: The findings support economic deprivation, social disorganisation, and acculturation
theories, and suggest that both neighbourhood and individual risk factors affect race/ethnic differences in
homicide mortality. Public health policies must focus on both individual and neighbourhood factors to
reduce homicide risks in vulnerable populations.
Homicide was the 15th leading cause of death and the
4th leading preventable cause of death in the US in
2000, and Hispanic and non-Hispanic black men aged
18 to 50 comprised a disproportionate share of those
deaths.1 2 Although much research focuses on black/white
differences in homicide mortality,3­8 little work examines
homicide mortality among Hispanics or Hispanic subgroups.9­13
MexicanAmericansarethelargestHispanicsubpopulationand
themostnumerousforeignbornpopulationintheUS.13 14 Over
10% of the US population is foreign born, of which nearly one
third hails from Mexico.15 Thus, we examine whether
neighbourhood characteristics affect Mexican American,
non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white differences in
homicide mortality, net of individual factors.
Three theoretical perspectives suggest that neighbourhood
factors might be associated with homicide mortality. Firstly,
economic deprivation theories posit that concentrated pov-
erty and economic inequality may provide people with scant
resources to achieve culturally valued goals including high
levels of education; safe, secure, and comfortable housing;
and well lit, maintained, and patrolled neighbourhoods.5 6
Residence in areas marked by economic deprivation may
hinder the ability of people to obtain loans, gain access to
high quality jobs, and receive high quality education.16­18
Communities that lack sufficient economic resources to
improve material and social conditions for their residents
may confer higher risks of homicide mortality.7
Secondly, social disorganisation theories posit that con-
centrations of single parent households or racial and ethnic
segregation may be associated with lower levels of social
control. Social control allows communities to mitigate violent
crime by regulating activities within their neighbourhoods
through participation in formal and informal organisations.19
Single parent households may have fewer resources to invest
in community participation or volunteer organisations, and
provide fewer adults who can monitor neighbourhood
activities, intervene in local disturbances, question strangers,
and potentially thwart criminal activities.20 21 High levels of
race/ethnic segregation partially derive from past discrimina-
tion by the real estate industry, federal housing policy,
banking institutions, and neighbourhood organisations that
restricted minorities to undesirable residential areas.17 22­25
Highly segregated areas often have poorer schools, higher
taxes, more dilapidated buildings, less political power, and
are targeted by alcohol advertisers and display higher rates of
drinking than their levels of poverty would suggest--factors
that are associated with high levels of violence.7 17 19 22­30
Areas marked by racial and ethnic segregation and high
concentrations of single parent families may provide few
resources for achieving social control and political power,
assets that could reduce homicide.
Thirdly, acculturation theories suggest that neighbour-
hoods with high concentrations of foreign born people may
protect against homicide mortality. Mexican culture pro-
motes norms and values that regulate activities and promote
health, by limiting excessive alcohol and illegal drug use--
behaviours that are often associated with homicide.31­34
Strong social relationships within foreign born communities
may emerge from shared experiences and language to help

facilitate positive economic mobilisation and discourage risky
and illegal enterprises. Furthermore, although acculturation
may result in higher levels of income and education and
access to better jobs, as immigrants integrate into US society
they adopt the less healthy norms and values of native non-
Hispanic white Americans.31 32 Acculturation may also lend
insight into the epidemiological paradox: Mexican Americans
often exhibit low mortality levels that parallel those of non-
Hispanic white Americans, although their low levels of
income and education would predict higher mortality, as
found among non-Hispanic black Americans.35 36 This para-
dox has resulted in speculation that neighbourhood factors,
such as foreign born communities, may buffer Mexican
Americans against mortality risks associated with low socio-
economic status.31­39
We investigate three limitations of prior research that
examines race/ethnic differences in homicide. Firstly, most
work examines homicide victimisation with either ecologi-
cal5­7 9 12 16 20 21 or individual level3 8 10 data, but only one study
examines homicide mortality with data from multiple
levels.11 Because both individual and neighbourhood factors
associate with overall mortality,4 40­42 we examine whether
risk factors at multiple levels affect race/ethnic disparities in
homicide mortality. Secondly, most nationally representative
studies of homicide mortality combine multiple Hispanic
subpopulations, include Hispanics with non-Hispanic black
and white populations, or exclude Hispanics altogether.3­5 8 10­13
Because some work suggests important variation in violent
death among different Hispanic groups,9 we examine
Mexican American and non-Hispanic black and white
disparities in homicide mortality. Finally, some research
finds that areas with high concentrations of immigrants
confer lower risks of overall mortality40; but no work
examines whether that protective effect extends to homicide
mortality. Thus, we examine the effect of the percentage of
foreign born people living in an area on homicide mortality.
METHODS
We use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for the
years 1986 to 1994, linked to the National Death Index (NDI)
through 1997.43 44 The NHIS is a nationally representative
annual cross sectional sample of the non-institutionalised
civilian population, with a very high response rate: well over
95% of contacted people complete interviews. The NDI is a
national database of deaths for adults aged 18 and older. The
linked NHIS-NDI data are prospective and better allow causal
inference than cross sectional data. We limit our sample to
adults aged 18 to 50 because homicide mortality is very
concentrated at those ages.
Individual and neighbourhood variables
The individual level variables in our analyses include self
reported race/ethnicity, sex, a race/ethnicity by sex interac-
tion, age in single years, nativity, marital status, employment
status, income to needs ratio, and education. Race/ethnicity
includes non-Hispanic white Americans, non-Hispanic black
Americans, and Mexican Americans; we exclude other
groups because of small numbers of deaths. The interaction
between race/ethnicity and sex accounts for the high
homicide mortality risks among Mexican American and
non-Hispanic black men.3 4 The foreign born variable includes
a dummy variable for missing data because NHIS only asked
this question in 1989 and later. We calculate the income to
needs ratio by estimating an income value for the open ended
income category in the NHIS; imputing missing income
values with demographic factors; standardising income to
1995 values; and dividing the midpoint of each income
category by family size. We detail the method used to impute
income elsewhere.45 Separate analyses (not shown) find that
those with imputed income values have identical mortality
risks as those without missing data. We exclude less than
0.8% of the cases because of missing data for key variables.
Wells and Horm of the National Center for Health Statistics
developed the methodology we use to create the ``neighbour-
hood'' variables, using the design features of the NHIS.46 The
NHIS sampling frame, from the years 1986 to 1994, is based
on census blocks and block groups. But Wells and Horm use
the term ``very small areas'' (VSAs) to denote these
geographical areas, because the NHIS occasionally interviews
people from adjoining blocks or block groups.46 47
Nevertheless, VSAs are marked by stable political or
geographical boundaries, including major roads, rivers, or
county lines, and are smaller and more homogenous than
census tracts or health service areas.47 48 Furthermore, the
NHIS interviews people in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia, and is designed to be geographically representa-
tive.47
The VSAs have unique identifiers that do not vary during
the study period, allowing us to match the areas across
multiple years of survey data. We estimate the VSA
characteristics from the aggregated individual level charac-
teristics of those persons living in a given geographical area,
by collapsing weighted individual data within each VSA.46 We
create all of the VSA level variables, except for the percentage
of immigrants living in an area (for reasons noted below), by
combining the VSA characteristics for the year of interview as
well as the two earlier and later years, where available.43 46 47
For example, we estimate the VSA data for people in 1992 by
averaging area characteristics from 1990 through 1994, but
VSA data for people in 1986 come from combining 1986
through 1988 data. This approach allows most VSA char-
acteristics to change over time, an advantage that census data
do not provide; ensures that the estimated VSA values come
from adequate numbers of people; and links the contextual
data to the respondents' area of residence for the years
surrounding the time of interview.46 Wells and Horm
produced stable estimates of the ecological variables with
only three years of data and suggest that combining data
across multiple waves of NHIS data provides a sampling
fraction of over 60% of the population of the block or block
group over time.46 Our VSA data come from an average of 141
and a range of 1 to 418 people. Separate analyses (not
shown) excluded the less than 0.8% of people from VSAs that
contained fewer than 20 respondents, to test for bias because
of poorly estimated neighbourhood data, and found results
identical to those presented here.
The VSA level variables include the level of economic
inequality based on the coefficient of variation; the percen-
tage of people living in poverty; segregation measured as the
percentage of Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic black
Americans4 41; the percentage of single parent households;
and the percentage of foreign born people, as shown in
table 1. The coefficient of variation is calculated as the
standard deviation of household income within the VSA

divided by the mean household income (mean = $38 695;
SD = $24 350; for the full sample in 1995 dollars).49 This
measure provides estimates that are similar to other inequal-
ity measures, including the Gini coefficient (results not
shown). Because of missing data prior to 1989, we estimate
the percentage foreign born in a VSA using data from 1989
and later, rather than allowing the level to vary across the
year of interview as with the other VSA variables. Separate
analyses (results not shown) included the median age in the
VSA, but we dropped it from our final models because it was
neither significant nor theoretically important. We code the
VSA variables dichotomously to ensure adequate numbers of
deaths in each category, minimise their skewed distributions,
and limit multicollinearity. Correlations among the neigh-
bourhood variables were 0.47 or below, lower than those
reported in other studies.11 42 We tested various logical cut off
points for the variables to ensure than each category contains
adequate numbers of people and that those within each
category face statistically similar homicide mortality risks.
The dependent variable for this analysis is risk of death
from homicide. We code homicide according to the E-codes
in the Ninth Revision of International Classification of
Diseases and include E960­E969.44 The NDI is highly reliable
and may more accurately assess homicide mortality than the
Uniform Crime Reports, another major database that records
US homicide deaths.50 We drop 2.8% of the NHIS respondents
that are termed ``ineligible'' because they lack key informa-
tion that could link them to future death records; otherwise
they would appear immortal. Among eligible people, women
and Hispanics are less likely to be matched to future
mortality than men and non-Hispanics, because of name
changes from marriage, or misspelling of Hispanic names and
lower reporting of social security numbers, respectively.44
These differences in the likelihood of being matched to
prospective homicide mortality may slightly inflate sex
differentials and deflate race/ethnic differentials.
Statistical analyses
To estimate hazards of death attributable to homicide over
the follow up period, we create a duration variable that
measures the time between the month of interview and the
month of death. Those surviving the entire follow up
duration are right censored, and those who die from causes
other than homicide are censored at the time of death. We
estimate the risk of death for up to 144 follow up months
using Cox proportional hazards models and report all
coefficients as hazards ratios. Tests indicate that our models
meet the proportionality assumption. We use Stata software

to correctly estimate the coefficients and standard errors,
because of the stratified, clustered, and non-equal probability
sampling frame used by the NHIS (Stata, version 8.0, College
Station, TX). We also provide robust standard errors while
clustering on the VSA identifier, to account for the non-
independence of people within neighbourhoods.51
Hierarchical models failed to converge because of the small
number of deaths, but other studies provide reasonable
estimates with the techniques we use here.11 40­42
Because most previous work uses either individual or
ecological variables, we use a modelling strategy that allows
us to examine whether individual and VSA characteristics,
first separately, then jointly, account for race/ethnic differ-
ences in homicide mortality. This allows us to ascertain the
advantages of using multilevel data. The G statistic tests for
improvements in fit between models, calculated as 22((log
likelihood of model 1)2(log likelihood of model 2)), where
the distribution is x2 and the degrees of freedom equal the
number of variables included between models.53 To interpret
the interaction terms, we calculate hazard ratios for each
race/ ethnic group, by sex. For example, the hazard ratio (HR)
for non-Hispanic black men relative to white men, is: HRblack
male
= (HRblack
)6(HRblack*male
). We also calculate the percent
decrease (PD) in hazard ratios between models as:
PD = (HRModel 1
2HRModel 2
)/(HRModel 1
21).
RESULTS
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the covariates by race/
ethnicity. At the individual level, Mexican Americans and
non-Hispanic black Americans are younger, less often married,
and less economically advantaged than non-Hispanic white
Americans. For example, only 35% of non-Hispanic black
Americans and 21% of Mexican Americans have any college
education, compared with nearly 50% of non-Hispanic
white Americans. The VSA variables also show race/ethnic
differences. Compared with non-Hispanic white Americans,
non-Hispanic black Americans and Mexican Americans
more often live in areas where economic inequality is
greater than or equal to 0.50 based on the coefficient of
variation, 15% or more of their neighbours live in poverty,
and 20% or more of the households are headed by single
parents. Moreover, compared with non-Hispanic white and
black Americans, Mexican Americans more often live in
areas where 4% or more of the residents are Mexican
American and 10% or more of the residents are foreign
born. Finally, 92% of non-Hispanic black Americans live in
areas where 10% or more of their neighbours are non-
Hispanic black, although only 18% of Mexican Americans
and 12% of white Americans live in similar areas.
We also present crude cohort specific homicide mortality
rates by race/ethnicity, calculated as the number of homicide
deaths over the follow up period per 1000 people interviewed.
These death rates are not fully comparable to national data
because we exclude Hispanics from the black and white
subpopulations; focus on Mexican Americans rather than all
Hispanics; and calculate cohort rather than period specific
homicide mortality rates. None the less, our rates mirror
national trends: non-Hispanic black Americans and Mexican
Americans exhibit much higher homicide mortality rates
than non-Hispanic white Americans.1 2 Although these rates
allude to important race/ethnic disparities in homicide
mortality, we now turn to the multivariate results to control
for age and other risk factors.
Table 2 presents hazard ratios for the risks of homicide
mortality. Model 1 shows that, at baseline, non-Hispanic
black Americans, Mexican Americans, and men have higher
risks of homicide mortality over the follow up period than
non-Hispanic white Americans and women, respectively.
Because the interaction between Mexican American and
male is significant, we include the interactions in all models
(table 3 provides a detailed interpretation of the interaction
terms). Model 2 finds that individual risk factors affect
homicide mortality. Those who are previously or never
married, unemployed or not in the labour force, less affluent,
or who have less education experience higher risks of
homicide mortality over the follow up period than their
currently married, employed, more affluent, or more edu-
cated counterparts. Furthermore, model 2 fits significantly
better than model 1 (x2 = 170, df = 10, p(0.05), although it
does not control for neighbourhood risk factors.
Model 3 finds that neighbourhood factors are also
associated with homicide mortality. Compared with residents
of neighbourhoods with less inequality or poverty, those
living in areas with levels of inequality of 0.50 or greater
based on the coefficient of variation have 48% higher and

Policy implications
N Public health policies must address the various
individual and neighbourhood factors that are asso-
ciated with high risks of homicide mortality. At the
community level, policies could promote neighbour-
hood watch programmes, improvements in local
schools, and less risky behaviours by more closely
regulating alcohol use among minors and drug use
among young adults.
N Public health initiatives that focus solely on individual
behaviours may be poorly equipped to lower homicide
mortality rates, unless they also target the fundamental

Neighbourhoods and homicide risks 227
www.jech.com
those living in areas where 15% or more of their neighbours
live in poverty have 21% higher homicide mortality risks over
the follow up period. Furthermore, relative to those in
neighbourhoods with little segregation and few single parent
households, those living in areas where 4% or more of the
residents are Mexican American have 37% higher, those
living in areas where 10% or more of the residents are non-
Hispanic black have 49% higher, and those living in areas
where 20% or more of the households are headed by single
parents have 36% higher homicide mortality risks, over the
follow up period. Finally, immigrant neighbourhoods are
protective: compared with those living in areas with fewer
foreign born residents, residents of areas where 10% or more
of their neighbours are foreign born experience 33% lower
risks of homicide mortality over the follow up period.
Although model 3 fits significantly better than model 1
(x2 = 37, df = 6, p(0.05), it does not control for individual
risk factors.
Model 4 includes both individual and contextual factors
and finds that both are associated with race/ethnic differ-
ences in homicide mortality. Indeed, net of individual level
risk factors, those living in areas with economic inequality of
0.50 or greater based on the coefficient of variation, or where
4% or more of the residents are Mexican American, 10% or
more of the residents are non-Hispanic black, 20% or more of
the households are headed by single parents, or less than 10%
of the residents are foreign born face increased risks of
homicide mortality over the follow up period. But the variable
for neighbourhood poverty drops from significance after
controlling for individual factors. Nevertheless, model 4 fits
significantly better than model 1 (x2 = 189, df = 16, p(0.05),
model 2 (x2 = 19, df = 10, p(0.05), and model 3 (x2 = 152,
df = 6, p(0.05).
Table 3 calculates hazard ratios for race/ethnic differences,
by sex, based on the estimates from table 2. Each model in
table 3 controls for, but does not show, the variables from the
respective model in table 2. Model 1 finds that compared
with non-Hispanic white men, non-Hispanic black men have
8.3 times and Mexican American men have 8.8 times the
homicide mortality risk over the follow up period.
Furthermore, compared with non-Hispanic white women,
non-Hispanic black women have 5.6 times and Mexican
American women have 3.1 times the homicide mortality risk
over the follow up period. Compared with model 1, models 2
and 3 show somewhat smaller race/ethnic disparities in
homicide mortality risks, suggesting that those disparities
result, in part, from differences in individual and neighbour-
hood level factors.
Model 4 shows that individual and VSA level character-
istics, in combination, partially account for race/ethnic
differences in homicide mortality. Compared with non-
Hispanic white men, non-Hispanic black men have 3.7 times
and Mexican American men have 5.0 times the homicide
mortality risk over the follow up period. Indeed, among men,
neighbourhood and individual factors account for a 63%
decrease in non-Hispanic black and a 48% decrease in
Mexican American homicide mortality risks, compared with
model 1. Concomitantly, compared with non-Hispanic white
women, non-Hispanic black women have 2.3 times and
Mexican American women have 1.7 times the homicide
mortality risk--an approximately 70% decrease for both non-
Hispanic black Americans and Mexican Americans, com-
pared with model 1.
DISCUSSION
Our findings contribute to the literature on race/ethnic
differences in homicide mortality in four ways. Firstly, we
find support for economic disadvantage theory.
Neighbourhood income inequality predicts increased risks
of homicide mortality, net of neighbourhood poverty and
individual factors. Others also find that neighbourhood
inequality associates with homicide mortality,5­7 probably
because inequitable areas limit residents' abilities to meet
valued goals including finding safe, comfortable, and afford-
able housing; maintaining and patrolling neighbourhoods; or
reducing levels of illicit drug or excessive alcohol use.6 7 16­19
But previous work finds that areas where 10% or more of the
residents live in poverty confer increased homicide mortality
risks.6 11 12 16 22 We find no such relation, perhaps because
those studies examine larger geographical areas, do not
control for same neighbourhood risk factors that we use here,
and seldom control for individual factors.
Secondly, our findings also support social disorganisation
theory. Residents in segregated areas experience higher
homicide mortality, presumably because those areas are
associated with discrimination, inadequate schools, numer-
ous alcohol outlets and abandoned buildings, and ultimately,
many obstacles to economic, social, and political advance-
ment.5­7 11 17 22­24 27­29 Previous studies also find that areas
where 10% or more of the residents are black confer higher
risks of overall and homicide specific mortality, although
unlike prior work, we find increased homicide mortality risks
in areas where 4% or more of the residents are Mexican
American, possibly because those studies combine all
Hispanics.4 11 Furthermore, areas where 20% or more of the
households are headed by single parents also confer
increased homicide mortality risks, probably because they
provide limited numbers of people who can participate in
formal and informal organisations.19­21 Socially disorganised
areas provide a dangerous mix: large numbers of potential
offenders who have few opportunities other than crime,
many potential victims, and few social organisations or indi-
viduals who are capable of protecting others from violence.53
Thirdly, areas with high concentrations of immigrants
protect against homicide mortality. Previous work finds that
areas where 10% or more of the residents are foreign born
protect residents against overall mortality40; we find that this
protection extends to homicide mortality. Immigrant com-
munities foster norms and values that discourage risky
activities including drug and alcohol misuse.31­34
Neighbourhood factors might also partially explain the
epidemiological paradox.35­39 Mexican Americans often live
in areas where 10% or more of the residents are foreign born
(table 1), which predicts lower risks of homicide mortality
net of individual economic resources.
Finally, both individual and neighbourhood risk factors
partially account for race/ethnic differences in homicide
mortality. Models that include either individual or ecological
variables alone less capably predict homicide mortality than
models that include both sets of risk factors simultaneously.
We build on findings from the single study that used data
from multiple levels to predict homicide mortality,11 by using
a longer follow up period and specifically examining Mexican
Americans and immigrant neighbourhoods.
Strengths and limitations
We contribute to the literature by using VSAs to capture
neighbourhood characteristics. Although the NHIS contains
confidential links to census data, estimated VSA data have
several advantages. Firstly, VSAs are an important resource
that allow researchers to examine both individual and
ecological risk factors with nationally representative and
publicly accessible data, without the expenses associated
with accessing the confidentially linked census data.46
Secondly, VSAs provide data on smaller, more homogenous
areas than census tracts, which customarily have been linked
to the NHIS data.11 41 42 Finally, VSA data allow us to capture
changes in area characteristics over time more accurately
228 Krueger, Huie, Rogers, et al
www.jech.com
than census data.46 But VSAs are not perfect: although the
NHIS systematically samples households in VSAs to max-
imise the variation within an area,47 and we estimate VSA
data from a large percentage of residents,46 biases may arise if
the sampled residents inaccurately represent an area. Future
work could test whether our findings persist in alternate data
sources.
We use VSA variables that are averaged across multiple
years, and then link both individual and VSA factors to
prospective mortality. But both individual and area char-
acteristics may have changed between the point of interview
and the time of death. Although neighbourhood character-
istics are comparatively stable over time, both in our data and
in other sources,54 and other studies use a prospective design
that is similar to ours,11 40­42 future work with panel data
could examine how changes in residence or individual risk
factors affect homicide mortality risks over time.
Furthermore, we have data on the area of residence, rather
than the location of death. Although most homicide deaths
occur close to home,25 future work could explore whether
multiple locations, including the places of work, residence,
recreation, and death affect homicide mortality.
Kaufman and colleagues note the importance of residual
confounding when examining race/ethnic differences in
mortality.55 56 They suggest that social and economic indica-
tors may have different meanings for minorities, who may
have suffered from discrimination in housing markets, job
opportunities, or educational access, relative to white people.
We partially account for their concerns by controlling for the
lower levels of personal income and education among
minorities, relative to white people, living in areas marked
by similar levels of inequality, segregation, single parent
households, and foreign born people.30 Nevertheless, future
research with more extensive data could examine more
precise measures of race/ethnic discrimination.18 24
Policy implications
Public health policies must seek to improve both neighbour-
hood and individual conditions. Initiatives that focus solely
on individual factors may be ineffective if they overlook the
substantial neighbourhood barriers--such as discrimination,
economic inequality, or norms for excessive drinking or drug
use--that are associated with violence.17­19 22­26 For example,
social organisation may be enhanced by expanding resources
for teacher and school development in poor or segregated
areas, and increasing participation in formal and informal
organisations such as neighbourhood watch programmes, block
groups, civic organisations, or churches and temples.19 57­59
Economic deprivation could be ameliorated by integrating
subsidised housing into neighbourhoods and developing
partnerships between businesses and schools to improve tran-
sitions to work.60 61 Finally, tighter regulation of illicit drug
sale and use, and alcohol use among minors, may confer some
of the advantages provided by immigrant communities.31­33
Policy makers must also recognise that local and national
agendas shape neighbourhoods. For example, strict sentences
for drug offences may unintentionally lead to high incarcera-
tions rates among black men, thereby increasing family and
economic disruption because of the shrinking pool of
marriageable and working black men.20 21 63 Thus, policies
that target the fundamental social and economic disparities
among racial and ethnic minorities might lower homicide
mortality more effectively than initiatives that aim solely to
change individual behaviours such as drug use or abusive
drinking.18 63

Healthy Cities shows the way to improve urban public health
Over half the world's population now
lives in large towns and cities, some
of vast size. For many families the
daily reality is of slum dwelling such as this
shanty town in India where open sewers,
uncollected rubbish, and roaming livestock
make up the neighbourhood environment.
Not surprisingly, infectious diseases remain
common. The World Health Organisation's
Healthy Cities initiative has set out to tackle
the new urban health agenda in a systematic
and holistic way.
