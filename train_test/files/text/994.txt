BACKGROUND: Premature menopause, also termed premature ovarian failure (POF), is characterized by cessa-
tion of menstruation before the age of 40 years. Little information is available on the general prevalence of POF or
on the prevalence by ethnic group. There is also a lack of information on the association of POF with health indica-
tors. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of women aged 40±55 years was conducted at seven sites in the USA to
determine eligibility for a community-based, multi-ethnic longitudinal study of the peri-menopause (The Study of
Women Across the Nation, SWAN). Interview data were used to (i) determine the prevalence of self-reported POF
overall and by ethnic group, and (ii) assess the association of POF with selected self-reported variables related to
health. Cases of POF included only women with no discernible cause for POF. RESULTS: POF was reported by
1.1% (126/11 652) of women. By ethnicity, 1.0% (95% CI, 0.7±1.4) of Caucasian, 1.4% (95% CI, 1.0±2.1) of African
American, 1.4% (95% CI, 0.8±2.5) of Hispanic, 0.5% (95% CI, 0.1±1.9) of Chinese and 0.1% (95% CI, 0.02±1.1) of
Japanese women experienced POF. The differences in frequency across ethnic groups were statistically signi®cant
(P = 0.01). Only Caucasian, African American and Hispanic women were included in further analyses since too few
Asian women had POF. In a multivariate model, POF was independently associated with osteoporosis, female hor-
mone use (excluding oral contraceptives), higher body mass index (BMI) and current smoking after adjustment for
education level, ability to pay for basics, site and age at interview. In Caucasian women, use of female hormones,
osteoporosis, severe disability and smoking were signi®cantly associated with POF. In contrast, POF in African
American women was associated with higher BMI and female hormone use, but not osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS:
The prevalence of POF appears to vary by ethnicity. Health factors associated with POF also vary by ethnicity but
because of the cross-sectional study design, it is not possible to determine cause and effect relationships. Health risks
of POF would bene®t from further study.

Introduction
Premature menopause, also termed premature ovarian failure
(POF), is a disorder characterized by cessation of menstruation
before the age of 40 years. POF has been studied primarily in
selected clinic populations, and rarely in community or
population-based studies of women. Based on elevated FSH
before the age of 40 years, Coulam et al. estimated that 0.9% of
women will experience POF (Coulam et al., 1986). Likewise,
in a population-based study of early ovarian failure, the
estimated prevalence of POF was 1.2% (Cramer and Xu, 1996).
Thus, only a few prior studies estimated the prevalence of POF.
Furthermore, little information exists on the prevalence of POF
in different ethnic groups.
The aetiology of POF other than that due to known causes
such as surgical intervention (hysterectomy or oophorectomy)
or chemical or radiation therapy is not well de®ned (Hoek et al.,
1997; Anasti, 1998; Santoro, 2001). Several hypotheses have
been proposed to explain the occurrence of POF of unknown
cause. Based on evidence of anti-ovarian antibodies and
defective antigen processing by immune cells, 50±70% of POF
was associated with an autoimmune disease of the ovary
(Luborsky et al., 1990, 1999; Fenichel et al., 1997; Hoek et al.,
1997; Yan et al., 2000). An autoimmune aetiology is consistent
with the reported association of POF with other autoimmune
diseases (Hoek et al., 1997). Genetic defects such as chromo-
some deletions or translocations, a breakpoint in the human

DIA gene, association with fragile X syndrome (Bondy et al.,
1998; Christin-Maitre et al., 1998; Davison et al., 2000) or
galactosaemia (Cramer, 1990; Cooper et al., 1994) have also
been detected in some women with POF. These observations
suggest that POF may be the consequence of processes that
differ from those leading to natural menopause around the
expected age of 50 years.
In addition, POF is associated with a more prolonged low
estrogen state than would be observed with natural menopause
at an average age of 51 years (McKinlay et al., 1992;
McKinlay, 1996). Consequently, POF, coupled with an
increasing lifespan, is potentially associated with both more
severe and different health risks, than natural menopause.
Early age at menopause has been reported to be associated
with increased risk of mortality (van der Schouw et al., 1996;
Cooper and Sandler, 1998), cancer (Cramer, 1990; Cooper and
Sandler, 1998), cardiovascular disease (Senoz et al., 1996; van
der Schouw et al., 1996; Joakimsen et al., 2000; Gold et al.,
2001), and osteoporosis (Kritz-Silverstein and Barrett-
Connor, 1993; Gokmen et al., 1995; Ohta et al., 1996;
Cooper and Sandler, 1997; Harlow and Signorello, 2000).
Relatively few of these studies speci®cally assessed women
with POF. For example, although cardiovascular disease risk
in women increases around menopause (van der Schouw et al.,
1996), it was shown that the risk did not differ between women
with POF and those with menopause around age 51 years
(Senoz et al., 1996). In contrast, bone density was lower in
women with POF compared with menopausal women
(Gokmen et al., 1995; Hartmann et al., 1997) or regularly
cycling women of similar age (Anasti et al., 1998). Additional
information on potential health risks speci®cally associated
with POF is needed.
In 1995±1997, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to
assess eligibility for enrolment into a multi-ethnic longitudinal
cohort study of the perimenopause, and to collect health,
reproductive, demographic and lifestyle data. The information
from this survey provided a unique opportunity to (i) describe
the frequency of POF in the overall population, and in speci®c
ethnic groups, and (ii) assess the association of selected
medical/biological and lifestyle factors with POF.
Materials and methods
Data were collected in a cross-sectional survey and used to
determine eligibility for participation in the longitudinal Study of
Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a prospective,
multi-ethnic, multi-disciplinary study of the natural history of the
menopausal transition. The study included seven locations in the
USA: Boston (MA), Chicago (IL), Detroit area (MI), Los
Angeles (CA), Newark (NJ), Pittsburgh (PA) and Oakland
(CA). Eligibility criteria for the cross-sectional survey were:
age 40±55 years, self-designation as Caucasian or in the targeted
racial/ethnic group for the site, residence in the geographical area
de®ned by one of the seven study sites, use of English or one of
the other selected languages (Spanish, Japanese, Cantonese), and
ability to give verbal consent to participate.
A common interview protocol was employed across the seven
clinical sites, supported by a written manual of operations, common
training, and standardization of research staff. Menopausal status was
based on self-report of menstrual characteristics. Menopause was
de®ned as no menses for 12 months. Age and ethnicity were self-
reported. Primary race/ethnicity was self-de®ned as Black or African
American, non-Hispanic Caucasian, Chinese, Japanese, or Hispanic
(Central American, Cuban or Cuban American, Dominican, Mexican
or Mexican American, Puerto Rican, South American, Spanish or
other Hispanic). Respondents could also specify `other', `mixed', or
no primary ethnic af®liation. Of the women that participated in the
cross-sectional survey (n = 16 065), 15 605 were a member of one of
the primary ethnic groups. The cross-sectional group included 7771
Caucasian women at seven sites, 4393 African American women at
four sites, and 1942 Hispanic, 654 Chinese and 845 Japanese women
at one site each.
In order to assess premature menopause, women whose menstrual
cycles had stopped for known reasons were excluded from analysis.
Women who had a hysterectomy (n = 3030), ovariectomy (n = 83),
cancer (n = 349), or who were currently pregnant (n = 31) or who
stopped menstruating for medical reasons (n = 170), pregnancy or
breast-feeding (n = 29), or severe weight loss or other reason (n = 78)
were excluded from analysis. In addition, those with missing values
for the exclusion criteria (n = 127) or missing information on the year
of cessation of menstrual cycles were excluded (n = 56). Of the
women screened, 11 652 were included in further analyses. The study
group included 9658 women who were still menstruating and 1994
women who had stopped menstruating.
The use of age 40 years to de®ne POF is empirical. An alternative
de®nition of POF is based on a cut-off age that is 2 SD (2Q2.5 years)
from the expected age of menopause at 50±51 years, or age 45 years
(Cramer and Xu, 1996; World Health Organization, 1996; Hoek et al.,
1997). However, cessation of menstruation before the age of 40 has
been customarily used to de®ne premature menopause in research and
clinical practice, and was used in this analysis (Hoek et al., 1997).
Furthermore, women aged b40 years were surveyed and thus all
women whose menstrual cycles ceased before the age of 40 years
could be identi®ed. Women with POF were de®ned using the self-
reported year that menses stopped and converting the year to the
midpoint date (July 1). The estimated date that menses stopped was
converted to the age that menses stopped by subtracting the date of
birth. Current age was calculated from the difference between the
interview date and the birth date. This variable was used to select
women who stopped menstruating before the age of 40 years.
Study variables
Variables reported in the literature as signi®cantly related to health,
physiology, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, age at menopause or POF
were selected. Self-reported history of arthritis, diabetes, heart attack/
angina, osteoporosis, ever use of oral contraceptives, use of hormones
in the past 3 months, ever use of hormones, ever use of female
hormones (excluding oral contraceptives), and ever had a live birth
had a `yes' or `no' response. Self-reported health had categories of
excellent, very good, good, fair and poor. Marital status was
categorized as married or living as married, or single (never
married/separated/widowed/divorced). Education was categorized
as high school or less, high school degree, some college, college
degree, or graduate studies. Income category was estimated from a
general question on how hard it was to pay for basics (very hard,
somewhat hard, not hard). Cigarette smoking was categorized as
never, former or current smoker. `Disability' was calculated from a
10 part question on daily activity (strenuous sports, moderate sports
or activity, ability to climb stairs, distance walked comfortably and
bathing) and was categorized as limited, limited a little, not limited.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported height
(cm) and weight (kg) as weight (kg)/height (m)2.

Analysis
Based on the concept that the mechanism of the dependent variable,
POF, is different than menopause around age 50 years, POF was
compared with a `non-POF' group that included women with and
without menses.
The prevalence of POF was calculated and the statistical
signi®cance of differences determined by Pearson's c2-analysis or
Fisher's exact test when expected values were <5. The age at
menopause for each ethnic group was displayed using the
Kaplan±Meier procedure for estimating survival and hazard rates.
Analysis of variance was used to evaluate group means for continuous
variables. The selected variables of interest were treated as
independent variables to assess associations with POF. Important
variables were identi®ed in unadjusted univariate analysis; those
signi®cant at the P < 0.1 level by c2-analysis were included in
multivariate analyses. Logistic regression with multiple variables was
used to consider the independent relationships of important covariates
with POF after adjusting for education and income category
(socioeconomic status), site and age at survey. Site was included in
all adjusted models since it was a characteristic of the sampling design
of the study.
Results
Prevalence
The overall prevalence of POF was 1.1% (Table I).
By ethnicity, 1.0% of Caucasian, 1.4% of African American,
1.4% of Hispanic, 0.5% of Chinese and 0.1% of Japanese
women experienced POF (Table I). The relative difference in
frequency of POF across ethnic groups was statistically
signi®cant (P = 0.01). POF was signi®cantly more prevalent
in Caucasian (P = 0.02), African American (P = 0.004) and
Hispanic (P = 0.004) women than in Japanese women
(Figure 1). The prevalence of POF was not signi®cantly
different between Chinese and Japanese women (P = 0.2).

The prevalence of women overall and by ethnic group was determined for women with premature ovarian failure (POF). The distribution of women with early
menopause between the ages of 40 and 45 yearsÐmenopause over the age of 45 yearsÐand pre-menopausal women are shown for comparison. Since the
information was obtained from women aged 40±55 yearsÐthe prevalence re¯ects the age and menstrual status at interview. The 95% con®dence interval (CI)
re¯ect a Bonferroni adjustment for four proportions within each ethnic group. The prevalence of POF among ethnic groups differed signi®cantly (P = 0.01)
when compared with women without POF.
Figure 1. The cumulative rate of menopause by age for each ethnic
group. The upper age limit displayed in the graph was determined
by the experimental design since only women aged 40±55 years
were included in the study. Overall, 1994 were menopausal (17.1%
of the sample) and 9658 were pre-menopausal (see Table I) at the
time of the interview. Premature ovarian failure (1% of the sample)
was de®ned as cessation of menstruation before the age of 40 years
(see inset). Japanese women tended to stop menstruating at later
ages.

201
Unadjusted association of POF with selected medical/
biological and lifestyle variables
Because of the small numbers of Asian women with POF,
further analysis was limited to Caucasian, African American
and Hispanic women. Arthritis, diabetes, poorer self-reported
health, higher BMI, osteoporosis, severe disability, use of
female hormones (excluding oral contraceptives), single
marital status, lower education level, dif®culty paying for
basics, and smoking were each signi®cantly associated with
POF in univariate analysis (Table II). In subset analyses, the
signi®cance of variables differed for Caucasian, African
American and Hispanic women (Table II). The prevalence
of POF by site also differed signi®cantly, but did not differ for
Caucasian or African American women in subset analyses and
was likely related to differences in ethnic composition by site.
After adjustment for education and paying for basics, site and
ethnicity were no longer signi®cant.
The mean (T SD) BMI was signi®cantly higher for women
with POF (29.3 T 8.4) compared with non-POF women (26.7
T 6.3; P = 0.001). However, the mean BMI differed between
African American women with and without POF (P = 0.03),
but did not differ for Caucasian (P = 0.1, non-signi®cant) or
Hispanic women (P = 0.7, non-signi®cant) with and without
POF.
Current smoking was associated with POF (Table II). The
association of POF and smoking differed by ethnicity. The

trends did not correspond to the prevalence of POF or
differences in the frequency of smoking by ethnicity. For
example, a similar proportion of African American (29.1%)
and Caucasian (23.6%) women but fewer Hispanic (17.1%)
women were current smokers (P = 0.0001), although the
prevalence of POF was similar among Hispanic, African
American and Caucasian women.
At interview, the average age of women with POF was
signi®cantly different from non-POF women with and without
menses (47.9 T 4.5 versus 46.5 T 4.3 years respectively; P <
0.0001). The average age of women with POF also varied
among ethnic groups at interview. Age may have an impact on
medical/biological variables. Therefore, an adjustment for age
at interview was made in multivariate analyses.
Multivariate models
Variables in univariate analysis with a P-value < 0.10 were
entered into multi-variate models. For women with POF
compared with women without POF in a multivariate logistic
regression model, self-reported history of osteoporosis, use of
female hormones (excluding oral contraceptives), higher BMI
and current smoking were associated with POF, after adjust-
ment for site, socioeconomic status and age at interview
(Table III).
The models differed for Caucasian and African American
women (Hispanic women were not analysed due to the small
numbers of affected women) (Table III). For Caucasian
women, osteoporosis, female hormone use (excluding oral
contraceptives), severe disability and current smoking were
associated with POF after adjustment for site, age and
socioeconomic status. For African American women, female
hormone use and higher BMI were associated with POF after
adjustment for site, age and socioeconomic status.
Discussion
Prevalence
This is the ®rst assessment of the prevalence of POF in a single,
multi-ethnic study. We observed that 1.1% of women in our
sample experienced POF before the age of 40 years. This result
agrees with two previous reports that 0.9% of women under age
40 years have elevated FSH (Coulam et al., 1986), and 1.2% of
women stopped menstruation before the age of 40 years
(Cramer and Xu, 1996). In addition, 4.2% of women experi-
enced an early menopause before age 45 years. This agrees
with a previous report of 5.0% (Cramer and Xu, 1996) in a
study of Caucasian women in the USA and 3.3% in the current
generation of French women (Cassou et al., 1997).
Furthermore, our data showed that the prevalence of POF
varies by ethnicity from 0.1 to 1.4% among Caucasian, African
American, Hispanic, Chinese and Japanese women. In this
study, signi®cantly fewer Japanese women experienced POF.
This is consistent with another report from SWAN that
menopause occurred signi®cantly later in Japanese women
(Gold et al., 2001). This is also consistent with the report that
the slope of the age of menstrual cycle cessation increases
sharply around the age of 50 years with a smaller skew toward
younger ages for Japanese women (Kono et al., 1990).
The age of menopause, and the accompanying loss of
functional follicles (Faddy et al., 1992), may be in¯uenced by
genetic determinants (de Bruin et al., 2001), and modi®ed 1±2
years from the average by various lifestyle and environmental
factors (Vermeulen, 1993; Cramer and Xu, 1996; van Noord
et al., 1997). Interestingly, the distribution of age at which
menses cease is skewed with a long left tail. Using mathemat-
ical curve ®tting, the distribution of age at menopause in
Finnish women was resolved into three curves with mean
values at 36.3, 42.9 and 50.5 years representing 3, 19 and 78%
of the study population respectively (Luoto et al., 1994). This is
consistent with the possibility that different processes are
involved in ovarian failure, or that selected processes
differentially accelerate ovarian ageing in some women.
Demographic/lifestyle associations
The variables selected for examination in this study were
reported in the literature as signi®cantly associated with POF.
In univariate analysis, dif®culty paying for basics, lower
educational level attained, single marital status, and smoking
were signi®cantly associated with POF in agreement with
earlier reports. The association of POF, or an earlier meno-

pause, with a tendency to be single was reported by others
(Gokmen et al., 1995; Cassou et al., 1997; Gold et al., 2001).
However, after adjustment for socioeconomic status in
multivariate analysis, marital status was no longer associated
with POF. Although low parity was related to earlier natural
menopause in other reports (Luoto et al., 1994; Torgerson
et al., 1994; Do et al., 1998; Frohlich et al., 2000; Gold et al.,
2001), it was not speci®cally associated with POF in this
study. Lower socioeconomic status is also associated with a
younger age at natural menopause (Luoto et al., 1994; Cramer
et al., 1995; Do et al., 1998; Gold et al., 2001). In this study,
two variables were used as indicators of socioeconomic status,
dif®culty paying for basics and educational level attained.
Both variables were associated with POF consistent with
previous studies of an earlier natural menopause in women of
low socioeconomic status (Luoto et al., 1994; Torgerson et al.,
1994; van Noord et al., 1997).
Smoking has been suggested as a signi®cant risk factor for
POF (Luoto et al., 1994; Cramer et al., 1995; Nilsson et al.,
1997; Cooper et al., 1999; Harlow and Signorello, 2000) and
early natural menopause (Willett et al., 1983; Cooper et al.,
1999; Gold et al., 2001) in studies that were primarily of
Caucasian women. In this study, smoking was not uniformly
associated with POF among ethnic groups. The prevalence of
POF was similar for Caucasian and Hispanic women and
Hispanic women smoke less than Caucasian women. One
explanation for the lack of association of smoking and POF for
Hispanic women may be that smoking was assessed at
interview rather than prior to POF. Alternately, ethnic
differences in nicotine metabolism and pharmacogenetics
(Caraballo et al., 1998; Perez-Stable et al., 1998; Benowitz
et al., 2002) may account for differences in the association of
POF and smoking among ethnic groups.
Health associations
In unadjusted univariate analysis, arthritis, higher mean BMI,
diabetes, osteoporosis, disability, poorer self-rated health and
female hormone use (excluding oral contraceptives) were
associated with POF. After adjustment for socioeconomic
status, age at interview and site, only osteoporosis, higher
BMI, female hormone use, and disability remained associated
with POF, depending on the ethnic group.
In this analysis, a self-reported history of osteoporosis was
the most signi®cant health factor associated with POF overall.
An association between earlier age at menopause and lower
bone density, as well as increased risk for osteoporosis, has
been reported (Kritz-Silverstein and Barrett-Connor, 1993;
Ohta et al., 1996). POF is also associated with increased risk
for osteoporosis (Gokmen et al., 1995; Hartmann et al., 1997).
Interestingly, in subset analyses, osteoporosis was associated
with POF in Caucasian and Hispanic women but not African
American women. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in
African American women and it was suggested that this is due
to a higher bone mass with lower initial rates of bone loss in
menopause (Luckey et al., 1996; Bohannon, 1999). However,
it is not clear if this is the basis for a lack of association of
osteoporosis with POF in African American women.
Relatively little information is available on the relationship
of physical disabilities to POF. Osteoporosis is associated with
disability (Kenny and Prestwood, 2000). In multivariate
analysis, severe disability was more likely to be associated
with POF in Caucasian and not African American women,
similar to the association of osteoporosis with POF.
Hormone use (excluding oral contraceptives) was associ-
ated with POF. Because of the cross-sectional design, we
cannot distinguish hormone use as a risk factor, from use as a
therapy, for POF. Hormones may include gonadotrophins and
steroids in infertility treatment or hormone replacement for
ovarian failure. Ethnic differences in hormone replacement
therapy prescription and use may vary from location and
medical practice structure (Jahnige and Fiebach, 1997; Brown
et al., 1999). However, recent hormone use (hormone use in
the past 3 months) was not associated with POF. This suggests
that the association of female hormone use (excluding oral
contraceptives) with POF may not solely represent estrogen
replacement therapy, or it may re¯ect an initial use of hormone
replacement therapy followed by its discontinued use.
In multivariate models, higher BMI was associated with
POF. Since this analysis considered weight at interview, it
does not re¯ect weight at the time of ovarian failure. Further,
because the study was cross-sectional, it is not possible to
determine if BMI was the same at the time of POF or if it
changed since the onset of POF. In some other studies, higher
mean BMI was related to later age at menopause (Leidy, 1996;
Kirchengast et al., 1998; Frohlich et al., 2000), although not in
all studies (Gold et al., 2001). In another report from SWAN,
BMI was associated with ethnicity and physical activity and to
a lesser extent, menopausal status and age (Matthews et al.,
2001). A variety of factors may in¯uence BMI such as
ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status and genetics (Wagner
and Heyward, 2000). The association of BMI with POF
requires longitudinal investigation in order to determine the
interpretation and signi®cance of the observation.
POF is associated with autoimmune diseases such as
diabetes type 1 (Dorman et al., 2001), Addison's disease
(Winqvist et al., 1995), polyendocrine autoimmunity
(Weetman, 1995; Myhre et al., 2001), and thyroiditis
(Falsetti et al., 1999; Luborsky et al., 1999). Women with
type 1 diabetes experienced menopause ~6±8 years earlier
than their non-diabetic sisters or unrelated controls (Dorman
et al., 2001). However, diabetes type 2 does not appear to be
associated with POF (Lopez-Lopez et al., 1999). Data on
diabetes were collected in this survey, but the type of diabetes
was not identi®ed. Diabetes approached signi®cance in
univariate but not in multivariate analyses in this study. An
association with POF may not have been clearly detected in
this study since diabetes type 1 and 2 were not differentiated in
data collection.
An association between POF and cancer and cancer-related
mortality has been reported (Cramer et al., 1983; Cooper and
Sandler, 1998). However, women with a history of cancer
were excluded in this analysis in order to eliminate chemo-
therapy or radiation treatment as a basis for ovarian failure
(Chiarelli et al., 1999).
J.L.Luborsky et al.

POF was not associated with a history of cardiovascular
disease. In a previous report from SWAN, heart disease was
associated with earlier age at natural menopause (Gold et al.,
2001). However, this apparent difference is consistent with
previous studies in which different conclusions were obtained
depending on whether POF was identi®ed as a speci®c study
group (Senoz et al., 1996) or if POF was not speci®cally
identi®ed in a group of menopausal women (van der Schouw
et al., 1996). The latter study reported the association between
cardiovascular disease, and earlier age at menopause occurred
early in the menopause transition but the risk declined with age
since menopause (van der Schouw et al., 1996). Thus, another
possible interpretation of the result in this study is that the risk
has already declined in women with POF.
Obviously, in a cross-sectional study design there are
limitations in the type of information that can be obtained
and in the interpretation of `associations'. The study group
represents a `window' in time of women aged 40±55 years.
Health risks that may be expressed at later ages, such as
cardiovascular disease, would not be identi®ed. Also, the
cause±effect relationship of POF and health or lifestyle factors
cannot be discerned. For example, tobacco use is categorized at
the time of interview but information on the use of tobacco
before POF occurred was not available in this study.
In summary, POF is not rare. The prevalence of POF varies
by ethnicity. Health factors associated with POF, and variations
among ethnic groups may differ from those of menopause
around age 50 years and would bene®t from further study.
