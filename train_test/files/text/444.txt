We reanalyze previously published data on 309
MZ and 333 DZ twin pairs aged 25 to 74 years
from the MIDUS survey, a nationally representative
archived sample, to examine how much of the
genetic covariance between a general factor of per-
sonality (GFP), a lower-order life history factor, and a
general physical and mental health factor, is of the
nonadditive variety. We found nonadditive genetic
effects (D) could not be ruled out as a contributor to
the shared variance of these three latent factors to a
Super-K Life History factor. We suggest these
genetic correlations support the view that a slow (K-
selected) life history strategy, good health, and the
GFP coevolved and are mutually coadapted through
directional selection.

A recent observation is that a General Factor of
Personality (GFP) occupies the apex of the multi-fac-
torial hierarchy in the same way that g, the general
factor of mental ability, occupies the apex in the orga-
nization of cognitive abilities. Individuals high on the
GFP are altruistic, agreeable, relaxed, conscientious,
sociable, and intellectually open, with high levels of
wellbeing, satisfaction with life, self-esteem, and emo-
tional intelligence. The explanation we favor for the
GFP is that, like g, it arose through evolutionary selec-
tion for adaptive traits that facilitate performance
across a wide range of contexts (Rushton et al., 2008).
The main alternative interpretation of the GFP (and
other higher-order factors above the Big Five) is that
they arise from artifacts of evaluative bias and scale
construction (Ashton et al., 2009; Bäckstrom et al.,
2009; McCrae et al., 2008).
The GFP has been found across diverse samples,
procedures, and inventories. The inventories so far
include several sets of the Big Five, the California
Psychological Inventory, the Comrey Personality Scales,
the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology,
the EAS Temperament Scales, the Guilford-Zimmerman
Temperament Survey, the Hexaco Personality
Inventory, the Hogan Personality Inventory, the Jackson
Personality Inventory, the Millon Clinical Multiaxial
Inventory-III, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory-2, the Multidimensional Personality
Questionnaire, the Personality Assessment Inventory,
the Temperament and Character Inventory, and the
Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (Figueredo
et al., 2004, 2007; Musek, 2007; Rushton et al., 2008,
2009; Rushton & Irwing, 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c,
2009d; Veselka et al., 2009a, 2009b).
The main empirical impetus to finding the GFP was
the increasing overlap and redundancy found among
personality measures, including substantial genetic
pleiotropy within and across factors (Ando et al., 2004;
Jang et al., 2006; Jang et al., 2002; Weiss et al., 2008).
One study found the GFP was independent of method
variance using a multitrait-multimethod analysis of self-
, teacher-, and parent-ratings of 391 13- to 14-year-olds
on the Big Five Questionnaire -- Children (Rushton et
al., 2009). Several cross-national twin studies have
found 50% of the variance on the GFP is attributable
to genetic influence and 50% to non-shared environ-
mental influence, including from 322 pairs of twins in
the United Kingdom, 575 pairs of 2- to 9-year-old twins
in South Korea, 651 pairs of 14- to 30-year-old twins in
Japan, and 386 pairs of 18- to 74-year-old twins in
Canada and the United States (Figueredo et al., 2004;
Rushton et al., 2008, 2009; Veselka et al., 2009a,
2009b). Moreover, the GFP is largely a genetic factor,
as indicated by the cross-twin cross trait correlations
that give rise to it being greater among MZ twin pairs
than among DZ twin pairs. The South Korean twin

data showed the GFP had emerged by 2- to 3-years of
age (Rushton et al., 2008).
In two twin studies, Rushton et al. (2008) found
the genetic variance was primarily of the nonadditive
variety (dominance and epistasis). For example, 53%
of the variance in the GFP extracted from a Prosocial
Questionnaire and the EAS temperament scales was
nonadditive in a study of 575 pairs of 2- to 9-year-old
Korean twins rated by their mothers. Nonadditive
genetic variance is important because it indicates a
trait has been under recent natural selection, which is
expected for a Darwinian fitness character, i.e., one
that leads to greater reproductive success (Fisher,
1954; Falconer, 1989). Nonadditive genetic variance
has been found for numerous personality scales as
well as for cognitive abilities, albeit sometimes only in
small quantities (e.g., Bouchard & McGue, 2003; Hur,
2007; Jensen, 1998; Johnson et al., 2008; Lykken et
al., 1992). Support for genetic dominance also comes
from the preliminary evidence of inbreeding depres-
sion on components of the GFP, just as there is for the
g factor of mental ability (Jensen, 1998). Inbreeding
depression occurs on a trait when deleterious recessive
alleles combine to lower the scores of offspring rela-
tive to parents. Thus, an Italian study found inbred
families were lower in extraversion and openness to
experience (Camperio Ciani et al., 2007). A Dutch
study revealed that the offspring of parents who came
from the same region in the Netherlands (and so were
more likely to be inbred) scored lower on sensation
seeking than those whose parents came from different
regions (Rebello & Boomsma, 2007).
The existence of a GFP poses interesting theoretical
questions regarding its evolutionary and genetic
origins. Rushton et al. (2008) suggested that because
individuals at the positive pole of the GFP possessed
more cooperative and prosocial personalities, they left
more progeny than those at the negative pole, since
people prefer as mates, fellow workers, and leaders,
those who are agreeable and emotionally stable. This
view of social and sexual selection was initially pro-
posed by Darwin (1871), who suggested that
directional selection acted to endow contemporary
humans with more cooperative and less contentious
personalities than their archaic ancestors, or than their
nearest living relatives, the chimpanzees.
Rushton et al. (2008) further proposed that the
GFP arose from directional selection for a slow life
history strategy. Building on MacArthur and Wilson's
(1967) analysis of r-K reproductive strategies, which
explains how animals and plants populate islands,
Rushton (1985, 1990) proposed that `one basic
dimension -- K -- underlies much of the field of per-
sonality' (1985, p. 445). Rushton postulated that
personality traits co-evolved with altruism, intelli-
gence, attachment styles, growth, health, longevity,
sexuality, and fecundity to form a cocoordinated suite
of traits organized to meet the trials of life -- survival,
growth, and reproduction. Unlike conventional per-
sonality psychology, life history theory predicts hierar-
chically organized traits, culminating in a single,
heritable, super-factor. Traits need to be harmonized,
not work independently of each other.
Life History Theory describes the strategic alloca-
tion of bioenergetic and material resources between
major components of fitness such as survival and
reproduction. The fast-slow (r-K) continuum repre-
sents a covarying range of reproductive behavioral
strategies inversely relating life history traits such as
fecundity and parenting. Life History Theory predicts
that species living in harsh (high-risk of mortality),
unpredictable, and uncontrollable environments
evolve clusters of `fast' life history traits, whereas
species living in predictable, stable, and relatively safe
and controllable environmental conditions evolve clus-
ters of `slow' life history traits (Ellis et al., 2009).
Hence, the fast life history strategist is a short-term
planner, taking benefits opportunistically with little
regard for long-term consequences. In contrast, the
slow life history strategist is a long-term planner,
delaying immediate gratification in the service of
future eventualities.
These considerations suggest that the slow life
history strategy predisposes individuals to favor
socially and sexually mutualistic or prosocial over
antagonistic or antisocial strategies (Figueredo &
Jacobs, 2009). Slow life history strategists are more
likely to engage in reciprocally altruistic relationships
with both kin and non-kin, as well as with both
romantic (not just sexual) partners and their offspring.
Slow life history strategists prefer long-term and coop-
erative social as well as sexual relationships, which are
easier and more profitable to maintain in their charac-
teristically more stable, predictable, and controllable
environments. We should therefore expect life history
evolution to favor the evolution of the GFP, because
the conditions favoring slow life history strategy are
those favoring the cooperative sociality indicative of
the GFP.
Research has confirmed many predictions from life
history theory (Bogaert & Rushton, 1989; Figueredo
et al., 2004, 2007; Templer, 2008). For example,
among university students, Bogaert and Rushton
(1989) found correlations between self-reported delin-
quency, sex guilt, mating effort (e.g., number of sex
partners), general intelligence, and an aggregate of
items assessing family size, maturational speed,
longevity, and altruism. Although the average correla-
tion between single indices of K-selection was low,
aggregate measures were predictive of a general factor
on which single items loaded an average of .31. The
results held true when three separate measures of
family background were statistically controlled.
In a twin study, Figueredo et al. (2004) reported
substantial phenotypic and genetic correlations of the
GFP with a latent K-Factor, measuring life history
strategy, as well as with Covitality, another latent
factor representing a composite of mental and physical

health. These three lower-order factors formed a sub-
stantially heritable `Super-K' dimension. Figueredo et
al.'s (2004) study was based on the National Survey of
Midlife Development in the US (MIDUS), a representa-
tive sample of 50,000 households that included 309 MZ
and 333 DZ twin pairs aged 25 to 74 years. Figueredo et
al. (2007) replicated these results using a sub-sample of
2,095 non-twin parents who by middle-age had chosen
their life niches to marry (or not), to bear and raise off-
spring (or not), and to create social networks. Both
studies controlled for `social privilege' by regressing out
level of education, race, and family income and found it
accounted for less than 10% of the variance and did not
change the pattern of factor loadings.
In the present study, we reanalyze Figueredo et al.'s
(2004) published twin data to examine whether domi-
nance covariance contributes to the substantially
heritable Super-K Factor, thereby suggesting a
common evolutionary history of recent directional
selection. The phenotypic and genetic correlations
found between the K-Factor and the Covitality Factor
resulted from a direct test of life history theory, in
which decreased morbidity and mortality were pre-
dicted to be features of a slow life history (e.g., Ellis et
al., 2009). The phenotypic and genetic correlations of
the GFP with both the K-Factor and Covitality Factors
were hypothesized to represent outward behavioral
displays of this increased phenotypic and genetic
quality (e.g., Weiss et al., 2002).
Method
The Data for Reanalysis
Figueredo et al. (2004) previously analyzed archival
data from the National Survey of Midlife
Development in the United States (MIDUS; Brim et
al., 2000), a nationally representative sample of
50,000 households that included 309 MZ and 333
DZ twin pairs aged 25 to 74 years. They grouped 253
of 2,000 questions into 30 life history scales to con-
struct three lower-order common factors (a
lower-order K-factor, a Covitality Factor, and a GFP),
which showed bivariate phenotypic correlations of
.54, .69, and .43, respectively. A substantially herita-
ble `Super-K' factor loaded on the three factors with
standardized regression coefficients of .82, .60, and
.75, respectively. The twin correlations for K,
Covitality, GFP, and Super-K were: MZ (.60, .52, .48,
and .56, respectively) and DZ (27, .26, .18, and .22,
respectively), yielding Falconer (1989) heritabilities of
.65, .52, .60, and .68, respectively. The tendency for
the DZ twin correlations to be less than half those of
the MZ twins implied the presence of nonadditive
genetic variance.
New Analysis
We used common pathway models (e.g., Johnson &
Vernon, 2005, pp. 150­151) to examine how much of
the shared phenotypic covariance among the K-factor,
the Covitality Factor, and the GFP might be attribut-
able to additive genetic covariance, nonadditive
genetic covariance, shared environmental covariance,
and nonshared environmental covariance. To this end,
we constructed and compared ACE, ADE, and AE
Common Pathway Models using the EQS 6.1 software
for structural equations modeling.
Results
Alternative Common Pathway Models: ACE, ADE, and AE
We first estimated to what degree the phenotypic cor-
relations among these variables can be attributed to
the common genetic (A), shared environmental (C),
and nonshared environmental (E) factors that impact
on all three of them through a higher-order latent vari-
able (Super-K). To the extent that the variables
correlated less than perfectly, this was attributed to
specific components of genetic, shared environmental,
and nonshared environmental factors (A, C, and E)
that underlie each of them. Table 1 displays a break-
down of these components of variance.
The first column (Super-K) of Table 1 shows the
loadings of the higher-order common factor on all three
trait factors, indicating a high degree of convergence
among the three indicators. The remaining columns
show the genetic variance (A2), shared environmental
variance (C2), and non-shared environmental variance
(E2). The first three rows show the specific squared A,
C, and E components of the K-Factor, the Covitality
Factor, and the GFP; the last row shows the common
squared A, C, and E components of the common
higher-order Super-K Factor. It is clear from this first
analysis that, as with most other behavioral genetic
results of personality, the degree of shared environmen-
tal variance is generally negligible. Several of these
parameters were constrained at the lower bound ( =
0.000) by the structural modeling software. A small
amount of specific shared environmental variance was
found for Covitality, but virtually none was found in
the higher-order Super- K Factor. The broad-sense heri-
tability coefficient (A2 = .61) of the higher-order factor
was comparable to that obtained initially by means of
the Falconer method (h2 = .68), albeit slightly lower.
Furthermore, as with the previous findings, these
results indicated that most of the genetic variance was
shared among the three convergent indicators of the
Super-K Factor. The fit of the ACE Common Pathway
Model was acceptable by all major criteria: 2(22) =
20.859, p = .5295, AIC = ­23.141, NFI = 0.988, CFI =
1.000, RMSEA = 0.000, and SRMR = 0.027.

We then estimated to what degree the phenotypic
correlations among these variables can be attributed
to the common additive genetic (A), nonadditive
genetic (D), and nonshared environmental (E) factors
that impact on all three of them through a higher-
order latent variable (Super-K). As with the ACE
model, to the extent that the variables correlate less
than perfectly, this is attributed to specific additive
genetic, nonadditive genetic, and nonshared environ-
mental factors (A, D, and E) that underlie each of
them. Table 2 displays a complete breakdown of these
components of variance.
As in Table 1, the first column (Super-K) of Table 2
shows the loadings of the higher-order common factor
on all three trait factors, indicating a high degree of
convergence among the three indicators. The remain-
ing columns show the additive genetic variance (A2),
nonadditive genetic variance (D2), and nonshared envi-
ronmental variance (E2). The first three rows show the
specific squared A, D, and E components of the K-
Factor, the Covitality Factor, and the GFP; the last
row shows the common squared A, D, and E compo-
nents of the common higher-order Super-K Factor.
Small amounts of specific additive genetic variance
were found for all three traits and small amounts of
specific nonadditive genetic variance were found for
the K-Factor and the GFP, whereas virtually no spe-
cific nonadditive genetic variance was found for the
Covitality Factor. As with the ACE Common Pathway
Model, some parameters were constrained at the
lower bound ( = 0.000) by the structural modeling
software. However, these results indicated that most
of the additive as well as nonadditive genetic variance
was shared among the three convergent indicators of
the Super-K Factor. As expected, however, the narrow-
sense heritability coefficient (A2 = .47) of the
higher-order factor was substantially lower than the
broad-sense heritability coefficient obtained initially
by means of the Falconer method (h2 = .68) as well as
by the ACE Common Pathway Model (A2 = .61), due
to the presence of nonadditive genetic variance (D2 =
.14). The fit of the ADE Common Pathway Model
was acceptable by all major criteria: 2(24) = 20.282,
p = .6806, AIC = ­27.718, NFI = 0.988, CFI = 1.000,
RMSEA = 0.000, and SRMR = 0.023.
Finally, we estimated to what degree the pheno-
typic correlations among these variables can be
attributed to the common additive genetic (A) and
nonshared environmental (E) factors that impact on
all three of them through a higher-order latent vari-
able (Super-K), eliminating the nonadditive genetic (D)
factor from the model. As with the ADE model, to the
extent that the variables correlate less than perfectly,
this is attributed to specific additive genetic and non-
shared environmental factors (A and E) that underlie
each of them. Table 3 displays a complete breakdown
of these components of variance.
As in Tables 1 and 2, the first column (Super-K) of
Table 3 shows the loadings of the higher-order
common factor on all three trait factors, indicating a
high degree of convergence among the three indicators.
The remaining columns show the additive genetic vari-
ance (A2) and nonshared environmental variance (E2).
The first three rows show the specific squared A and E
components of the K-Factor, the Covitality Factor, and
the GFP; the last row shows the common squared A
and E components of the common higher-order Super-
K Factor. Some specific additive genetic variance was
found in all three traits. As with the ADE Common
Pathway Model, however, these results indicated that
most of the additive genetic variance (A2) was shared
among the three convergent indicators of the Super-K
Factor, yielding the same heritability estimate as the
ACE Common Pathway Model (A2 = .61) due to the
absence of shared environmental effects in the latter.
The fit of the AE Common Pathway Model was
acceptable by all major criteria: 2(29) = 21.985, p =
.8208, AIC = ­36.015, NFI = 0.987, CFI = 1.000,
RMSEA = .000, and SRMR = 0.026.
Summary of Results
Figure 1 shows that the results of fitting the ADE
Common Pathway Model to the correlations between
the K-Factor, the Covitality Factor, and the GFP. The
A, D, and E path coefficients are shown in unsquared
form. All three alternative models fit just about
equally well by all statistical and practical measures of
goodness of fit. In terms of degrees of freedom, the
most parsimonious model is the AE Model, followed
by the ACE Model, followed by the ADE Model.
However, the advantage in degrees of freedom of the
ACE Model over the ADE Model is purely attribut-
able to more of the ACE Model parameters being
constrained at the lower bound ( = 0.000) by the
structural modeling software, due to the virtual
absence of shared environmental effects in the K-
Factor and the GFP. Interestingly enough, the only

trait for which non-zero shared environmental effects
were estimated, Covitality, was the one trait for which
no specific component of nonadditive genetic variance
could be estimated.
We conclude that, considering the small sample
size available in the MIDUS twin data, the possibility
of nonadditive genetic effects (D) cannot be conclu-
sively rejected. Moreover, assortative mating effects
have not been taken into account in these models but
we know they exist on comparable measures at a sta-
tistically significant level and are crossculturally
replicable (r = 0.26, p = .0001; Figueredo & Wolf,
2009). As such, they will increase the DZ twin correla-
tions and increase the confidence in our conclusion
about not being able to rule out a nonzero nonaddi-
tive genetic component. The main point of our
analysis, however, is that to the extent that there is
nonadditive genetic variance in these three traits, the
preponderance of that nonadditive genetic variance is
shared, presumably indicating a common history of
recent directional selection. The fact that this nonaddi-
tive component of genetic variance is shared among
three traits makes this finding relatively unlikely to be
the result of a Type I Error.
Discussion
The present results show that nonadditive (D) models
cannot be ruled out to account for the shared contri-
bution of three lower-order heritable factors (a
lower-order K-Factor, a Covitality health factor, and a
GFP) to the Super-K Life History Factor identified by
Figueredo et al. (2004). This suggests these three traits
have been under the same recent directional selective
pressures. These genetic correlations support the view
that slow (K-selected) life history strategy, good physi-
cal and mental health, and the GFP coevolved and are
mutually coadapted. Moreover, it suggests that a slow
life history arose from directional selection.
The evolutionary genetics of personality has been
re-gaining theoretical momentum in recent years with
increasing effort to compare rival hypotheses using
quantitative estimates of relevant parameters. For
example, Penke et al. (2007) discussed three models of
the origins of individual differences -- selective neu-
trality, mutation selection balance, and balancing
selection by environmental heterogeneity. The advan-
tage of identifying a GFP at the apex of the hierarchy
of personality is that it clarifies the underlying trait
structure, integrates lower-level theories, and helps
choose between the competing evolutionary theories.
According to a life history perspective, traits will be
hierarchically organized, culminating in a single, har-
monized super-factor (Figueredo et al., 2004, 2007;
Rushton, 1985, 1990; Wilson, 1975). Traits need to
be coordinated and work together, not act indepen-
dently or in opposition to each other.
The well-defined positive and negative pole of the
GFP (the former being more cooperative and proso-
cial) suggests how and why unidirectional selection for
personality might have occurred from `primeval man
and his ape-like progenitors', as Darwin (1871, p.
159) phrased it. Those at the high end of the GFP --

altruistic, open, conscientious, sociable, agreeable,
emotionally stable, and emotionally intelligent -- can
be expected to enjoy better social relationships and
greater reproductive success since people prefer as
mates, fellow workers, and leaders those who are
agreeable, cooperative and emotionally stable
(Figueredo et al., 2006; Miller, 2007).
More recently, Hrdy (2009) reviewed evidence
that `cooperative breeding' helped foster uniquely
human traits over the last 2 million years, including
extended lifespans, prolonged childhoods, big brains,
perspective-taking, language use, cumulative culture,
mutual understanding, norm formation, altruistic
punishment, and moral judgment. Hrdy argued that it
was cooperation among extended kin over child-
rearing that produced the human life history (and, by
implication, the GFP). She wrote, `novel [child]
rearing conditions among a line of early hominins
meant that youngsters grew up depending on a wider
range of caretakers than just their mothers, and this
dependence produced selection pressures that favored
individuals who were better able at decoding the
mental states of others, and figuring out who would
better help and who would hurt' (p. 66).
Other evolutionary scenarios are possible.
Following Fisher (1954), Nesse (2007) has proposed a
theory of runaway social selection for displays of
partner value and altruism in which competition to be
selected as a social partner produces runaway selective
processes in the same way that competition to be
selected as a sexual partner does in runaway sexual
selection. Individuals prefer social partners who
display valuable resources and bestow them selectively
on associates. This produces selective pressure for
individuals to accurately identify: (1) socially valued
resources, subject to the economic principles of supply
and demand; and (2) preferred social partners, based
on their resource and altruistic displays. These selec-
tive pressures tend to produce genetic correlations
between the resource displays and the partner prefer-
ences. Thus, these traits will come to be correlated
because of runaway social selection for an ideal
person. Moreover, people able to cooperate in groups
are also more likely to win competitions and wars
(Alexander, 1979; Darwin, 1871; Geary, 2005).
This theory might also help inform the debate in
other ways. The main alternative to an evolutionary
explanation for the GFP is some form of methodologi-
cal artifact such as social desirability responding (e.g.,
Bäckstrom et al., 2009; McCrae et al., 2008).
However, such criticisms are psychometrically, but not
evolutionarily informed. For example, if one seriously
considers Nesse's (2007) theory of runaway social
selection, then the generally acknowledged population
preference for a personality profile reflecting the
pattern of the GFP (Figueredo et al., 2006; Miller,
2007) will inevitably produce selective pressure that
creates a GFP even when none previously existed.
Moreover, the preference for the trait and the trait
itself would become genetically correlated. Therefore,
the existence of an evaluative bias does not, by itself,
constitute a sufficient theoretical reason to discount
the reality of the GFP, but instead provides grounds to
propose its existence as a truly substantive phenome-
non. In social evolution, an evaluative bias is not a
methodological artifact, but a selective pressure (e.g.,
Fisher, 1954). Individuals with a socially desirable
response bias, indicating an evolved preference for
socially desirable behaviors in themselves and others,
will therefore actually be more likely to carry genes
for exhibiting those socially desirable behaviors.
In spite of our present emphasis on the evolution-
ary significance of shared nonadditive genetic variance
for the coevolution of personality with life history
strategy, substantial additive genetic effects have been
documented by ourselves and others in the GFP and
lower-order traits as well as in life history strategies.
As Penke et al. (2007) discuss, additive effects are
compatible with balancing selection and with muta-
tion-selection balance. If allied to runaway social
selection, this too could imply directional selection
consistent with a mutation-selection model including
both additive and nonadditive effects. Figueredo,
Wolf, et al. (in press) have recently outlined the multi-
ple selective pressures that have hypothesized to bear
on the evolution of individual behavioral differences.
Many evolved adaptations are the product of, not one,
but multiple selective forces. In Newtonian Physics,
the `resultant' is the vector sum of two or more
vectors representing multiple forces acting simultane-
ously on a single material particle. The same principles
hold in evolutionary biology.
As in contemporary theories of Multilevel Selection
(Wilson & Wilson, 2007), multiple selective pressures
may act on any given trait simultaneously. Thus, there
is seldom a one-to-one correspondence between a spe-
cific trait and a specific selective pressure. For
example, both intrasexual and intersexual selective
pressures clearly influence female mate choice.
Females may prefer males with good genetic quality,
but may also prefer males that demonstrate intrasex-
ual dominance. Thus, distinguishing the products of
intra-sexual competition from intersexual selection,
even in female mate choice, is a challenge because
both may be responsible for the evolution of a particu-
lar trait. Thus Life History Strategy, the GFP, and
Personality in general may be the results of both bal-
ancing and directional natural selection, as well as
some elements of runaway social and sexual selection,
giving rise to both additive and nonadditive compo-
nents of genetic variance.
The confirmation of a GFP may also shed light on
the neurobiology of personality and provide help in
the search for personality genes. Investigators who
view a GFP as occupying the apex of the hierarchy are
likely to adopt different research strategies from those
who consider the Big Two, the Big Three, or the Big
Five as the highest level. Increasingly, a fewer number

of higher-order constructs are being proposed with
wider and more pervasive effects such as the impor-
tance of effortful control (MacDonald, 2008) and
serotonin (Carver et al., 2009).
We therefore conclude that there is evidence for
recent directional selection favoring the emergence of
the GFP. However, there are obviously other pressures
at work to maintain interindividual variability, includ-
ing various disruptive social selection pressures that
have been identified and reviewed elsewhere
(Figueredo et al., 2005; Figueredo, Vásquez, & Sefcek,
2009; Figueredo, Gladden, et al., in press; Figueredo,
Jacobs, et al., in press; Figueredo, Wolf, et al., in press;
Penke et al., 2007). It seems clear that further research
is needed on the nature and origins of the GFP and its
relation to Life History Theory.
