Peer selection and influence effects on
adolescent alcohol use: a stochastic actor-based
model
Marlon P Mundt1*, Liesbeth Mercken2 and Larissa Zakletskaia1
Abstract
Background: Early adolescent alcohol use is a major public health challenge. Without clear guidance on the causal
pathways between peers and alcohol use, adolescent alcohol interventions may be incomplete. The objective of
this study is to disentangle selection and influence effects associated with the dynamic interplay of adolescent
friendships and alcohol use.
Methods: The study analyzes data from Add Health, a longitudinal survey of seventh through eleventh grade
U.S. students enrolled between 1995 and 1996. A stochastic actor-based model is used to model the co-evolution
of alcohol use and friendship connections.
Results: Selection effects play a significant role in the creation of peer clusters with similar alcohol use. Friendship
nominations between two students who shared the same alcohol use frequency were 3.60 (95% CI: 2.01-9.62) times
more likely than between otherwise identical students with differing alcohol use frequency. The model controlled
for alternative pathways to friendship nomination including reciprocity, transitivity, and similarities in age, gender,
and race/ethnicity. The simulation model did not support a significant friends' influence effect on alcohol behavior.
Conclusions: The findings suggest that peer selection plays a major role in alcohol use behavior among adolescent
friends. Our simulation results would lend themselves to adolescent alcohol abuse interventions that leverage
adolescent social network characteristics.
Background
Early adolescent alcohol use is a major public health
challenge. One quarter of all adolescents begin drinking
alcohol by 13 years of age [1]. Drinking before the 14th
birthday is associated with a fourfold increase in risk of
alcohol dependence in adulthood [2]. Early alcohol initi-
ation is linked to many risky adolescent behaviors, in-
cluding marijuana and cocaine use, having sex with
multiple partners, and academic underperformance [3].
A wide body of literature indicates that adolescents
and their friends exhibit more similar alcohol use behav-
ior than would be expected by chance alone [4,5].
Drinking by a best friend has been tied to alcohol initi-
ation among middle and high school students [6,7]. In a
systematic review of longitudinal studies on adolescent
drinking, alcohol-using peers were consistently predict-
ive of an adolescent's own drinking behavior at a later
wave [8]. However, there is debate over the mechanism
by which friends come to resemble one another over
time. One possible explanation is that similarities occur
as a result of peer influence, or the spread of behaviors
and behavioral norms through social ties. In this manner,
the behavior of an individual would move toward the
average behavior of one's friends over time. Another
pathway to homogeneity within friendships is that
friends may be similar due to social selection, or homo-
phily, the tendency for similar people to be attracted to
and form friendships among one another.
Understanding the mechanism by which similarity in
alcohol use behavior among adolescent friends occurs is
an important clinical matter. Lacking clear direction on
the causal pathways between peer interactions and alco-
hol use, adolescent brief alcohol interventions have pro-
duced, at best, mixed results [9,10]. As an example,

influence-driven contagion in adolescent groups would
lend itself to peer-to-peer methods of alcohol use inter-
vention. It would also allow for the possibility of multi-
plier or spillover effects from targeted individuals to a
larger network of friends. Selection-driven behavior pat-
terns in adolescent groups would lend themselves to
interventions that target alcohol use in adolescent
friendship groups identified through social network
characteristics.
Previous studies have attempted to disentangle selec-
tion from influence effects in adolescent alcohol use
[8]. Analytic techniques employed have included struc-
tural equation modeling [11-13], latent growth models
[14-18], instrumental variables [19], and fixed effects
[20]. These studies have relied on lagged indicators of
alcohol use and friendship connections in an attempt to
isolate the selection effect from influence. The results
indicate that both selection and influence are occurring,
but the relative contribution of the two factors cannot
be determined.
A major limitation in prior studies on selection and in-
fluence effects in adolescent alcohol use is the failure to
account for the co-evolution of network ties and alcohol
use behavior. Assuming network ties are fixed while esti-
mating changes in drinking produces biased parameter
estimates. In a similar manner, modeling alcohol use as
constant when estimating friendship tie formation can
lead to systematic error in results. In addition, previous
studies are limited in their control for social network
elements beyond the unidirectional dyadic relationship
which could drive friendship formation and behavior
change. These factors include reciprocity (i.e., the likeli-
hood to reply to friendship with friendship) and transi-
tive closure (i.e., the likelihood of friends of friends to
become friends). Furthermore, previous modeling strat-
egies fall short in accounting for the dependent nature
of social network ties data. Peer interactions that encom-
pass interdependent selection and influence effects vio-
late the notion of independence required by traditional
modeling techniques such as structural equation or fixed
effects modeling. The complexity of longitudinal social
network data necessitates more advanced statistical
methods than were used in previous studies of adoles-
cent alcohol use.
A new analytical approach to the analysis of the co-
evolution of social network ties and behavior is stochastic
actor-based modeling [21-23], which provides a power-
ful new tool to simultaneously model an agent's selection
of friends based on alcohol use and changes in an agent's
alcohol use behavior over time. The primary assumptions
of the actor-based model are that individuals choose their
friendship ties and their behaviors in one step-at-a-time
micro-steps. At each micro-step, an agent maximizes a
personal utility function for surrounding network and
relative friend behavior. At that time point, the agent
only considers the current network characteristics in de-
ciding whether a change in behavior or network tie is
preferable to the current state. In this manner, the
process of co-evolution of network and behaviors from
one wave of data to another is simulated as a result of a
potentially large number of individually unobserved
micro-step changes, and the network and behavior pre-
ferences parameters can be estimated. The actor-based
model can disentangle selection and influence and deter-
mine their relative contribution to similarities in alcohol
use behavior among friends [23-25].
Recent studies have begun to use actor-based model-
ing to examine the relative contribution of selection and
influence effects on adolescent alcohol use [26-30]. In
one such study, a sample of 1,204 7th graders in Finland
were followed for 30 months to determine the degree to
which the children selected or were influenced by
friends based on alcohol use. The results indicated both
selection and influence played a role in alcohol use
similarities among friends, although influence was
stronger at younger ages and selection became stronger
as students aged [30]. Another study followed cohorts
of 4th graders, 7th graders, and 10th graders in Sweden
for 2 years. The findings indicated that selection based
on alcohol use was strongest in early adolescence, while
both influence and selection effects contributed to alco-
hol use similarities during later adolescence [29]. More
research is needed to determine the relative role of se-
lection and influence in alcohol use homogeneity within
adolescent friendships. The current study will add to
this body of literature by examining alcohol use behav-
ior in a large sample of 7th through 11th grade U.S.
adolescents.
Without clear guidance on the causal pathways be-
tween peers and alcohol use, adolescent alcohol inter-
ventions may be incomplete [9,31,32]. To fill this gap in
the literature, the present study will investigate the selec-
tion and influence processes as they relate to peer
friendship formation and alcohol use behavior in the lar-
ger context of adolescent friendship networks. Specific-
ally, the study will address the following research
questions:
Selection Research Question #1 Do adolescents select
friends with similar
alcohol use?
Influence Research Question #2 Do adolescents adjust
their alcohol
consumption in
correspondence with
the alcohol
consumption level of
their friends?

We hypothesize that both selection and influence
effects will be present in the network model of adoles-
cent alcohol use.
Methods
Data source
This study analyzes data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The Add
Health study used stratified sampling to choose high
schools and middle schools which were representative of
US schools nationwide based on region of the country,
urbanicity, school funding, and racial composition [33].
To construct the Add Health study sample, initially, all
7th through 12th graders at the 132 participating schools
were invited to complete an In-School Survey. Students
completing the In-School Survey (n = 90,118) were then
eligible for the longitudinal portion of the study, which
began with an in-home interview and parent survey. A
random sample of 20,745 students selected from the In-
School Survey respondents completed a Wave 1 in-
home survey, which was administered between April
and December, 1995. The Wave 1 survey collected data
on social and demographic characteristics of the respon-
dents, education and occupation of parents, household
structure, risk behaviors including alcohol use, expecta-
tions for the future, self-esteem, health status, school-
year extracurricular activities, and friendships. As part of
the in-home survey, students selected their five best
male and five best female friends from a complete school
roster.
Approximately one year later, Wave 1 participants
who had not yet graduated from high school were
recontacted for a Wave 2 in-home survey. The Wave 2
in-home survey (n = 14,738) took place between April
and December, 1996. The content of the Wave 2 survey
was similar to data collected in Wave 1, including fre-
quency of alcohol consumption over the past year. As
part of Wave 2, students were again provided with a
complete school roster and asked to name their five best
male and five best female friends. The Wave 2 cohort
excluded all subjects who were in their final year of high
school at Wave 1.
The Add Health sampling design included saturated
sampling of students at 14 schools. All students in at-
tendance at these schools at the time of the Wave 1 sur-
vey were included in the sampling frame for the in-home
survey. The inclusion of all students from a school allows
the investigation of complete peer network structures
and their influence on behaviors and life choices.
Analysis sample
The study sample for the present analysis includes 2,563
Add Health subjects from the saturated school sub-
sample. Subjects who completed the Wave 1 in-home
interview but were non-responders at Wave 2 were
included in the model using the SIENA imputation ap-
proach [21]. In this approach, outgoing ties of non-
responders are imputed and treated as non-informative
for statistical calculations using last observation carry
forward while incoming ties are allowed to vary and to
contribute to the estimation procedures. The sample
excluded subjects who did not name or were not named
by at least one friend at either Wave 1 or Wave 2.
Low network stability between study waves could
throw doubt on the reliability of the friendship data
reported and may increase the likelihood of convergence
failure in the iterative estimation process. The Jaccard
index is a measure of network stability between study
waves [34], indicating the proportion of existing friend-
ship ties within each school which remain consistent
from Wave 1 to Wave 2 out of the total number of ties
reported at either wave. The index is calculated as:
J Â¼ F11
Ã° Ã= F11
Ã¾ F01
Ã¾ F10
Ã° Ã;
where F11
is the number of ties present at both waves,
F01
is the number of new ties formed in Wave 2, and F10
is the number of ties dissolved between Wave 1 and
Wave 2. A Jaccard Index of 0.20 or higher for the school
is generally required for inclusion in a stochastic actor-
based model analysis [21]. One school from the satu-
rated subsample was excluded from the analysis based
on a Jaccard index of less than 0.20. A possible explan-
ation for low network stability is that friendships change
when students transition from a middle school to high
school setting. A total of 13 schools were included in the
analysis.
Measures
Variables were chosen a priori based on previous find-
ings in the adolescent alcohol literature [11-20,35].
Alcohol use
On the in-home survey, students answered the question:
"How often did you consume alcohol in the past year?"
Categorical responses included never, 1 or 2 times, 3 to
12 times, monthly but not weekly, weekly, and more
than once a week.
Social networks
At both Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the study, students pro-
vided responses to: "Name your 5 best male and 5 best
female friends from your school roster." Social networks
within each school resulted from the formation of a
friendship matrix based on the directed friendship
designations.

Demographics
Students provided age, grade, and race/ethnicity data at
the in-home interview. Age was calculated to the nearest
month.
Family characteristics
Our previous studies of the Add Health data show that
family bonding is a strong predictor of adolescent alco-
hol use [36]. Study participants answered: "On a scale of
1 to 5, how often do you and your family have fun to-
gether?" This item on family fun represents the notion
of family bonding in Add Health. In addition, parents of
the sample students indicated in a parent interview con-
ducted at Wave 1 how often they drank alcohol in the
past year.
Statistical analysis
Stochastic actor-based modeling
The analysis uses stochastic actor-based modeling to as-
sess the co-evolution of alcohol use and friendship ties
from Wave 1 to Wave 2 of the study [21]. The stochastic
actor-based model assumes changes in the network take
place according to a continuous-time Markov chain with
stationary transition distribution. Changes from Wave 1
to Wave 2 occur through mini-steps where the future
state of the network is dependent only on the present
state. Each mini-step is evaluated by choosing a random
student i among all network members and either a po-
tential friendship change or behavior change. In a poten-
tial friendship change, the student i might change an
outgoing tie to student j so as to maximize the objective
function for network structure and a random unex-
plained influence:
f X
i
; x i  j
Ã° Ã; z
Ã° Ã Ã¾ UX
i
t; x; j
Ã° Ã
where  is the parameter set, x(i ! j) is the network
changes that would occur if the tie between individual i
and individual j in the network were changed, z is the
state of behaviors within the network, and U is an inde-
pendent random component. For a given actor i (the
actor who takes the micro-step), the objective function is
maximized over all potential alters j. The  parameters
are estimated by Method of Moments (MoM). The MoM
algorithm compares the observed network (obtained
from the data) to hypothetical networks generated
through repeated Monte Carlo simulations [22].
Similarly, the individual i might make a one-step
change in alcohol-use behavior based on the objective
function for the parameterized alcohol outcome and a
random influence:
f Z
i
; x; z i
Ã° Ã
Ã° Ã Ã¾ UZ
i
t; z; i
Ã° Ã
where  is the parameter set for behavior changes, x is
the current state of network ties, z(i) is the next poten-
tial behavior state that would occur after a micro-step
change, and U is an independent random component.
By estimating the  parameters in the model, the simu-
lated analysis seeks to define what tendencies and trends
influence changes in friendship ties and in alcohol-use
behavior. The study model simultaneously evaluates the
evolution of the adolescent friendship network and ado-
lescent alcohol drinking while controlling for age, gen-
der, race/ethnicity, parental drinking, and family
bonding. The study uses the statistical program RSIENA
(Simulated Investigation for Empirical Network Ana-
lysis) [21], originally designed by Snijders and van Duijn
[37] and programmed by Ruth Ripley and Krists
Boitmanis.
Model specification
The model specification consists of two parts, friendship
network evolution and alcohol use behavior evolution.
First, the friendship network evolution portion of the
model identifies the preferred choices in friendship ties
depending on a list of friendship choice variables.
Friendship choice variables are based on current net-
work structure and friend attributes at each iterative step
of the simulation process. Three alcohol-related vari-
ables are included in the friendship evolution part of the
model: (1) the effect of an adolescent's alcohol use be-
havior on number of friends chosen (alcohol use
ego), (2) the effect of an adolescent's alcohol drinking on
the probability of being chosen as a friend by others
(friend alcohol use), and (3) the effect of similar alcohol
consumption on friendship selection (alcohol use
similarity).
Several characteristics of the friendship network struc-
ture are included as control variables [21,38,39]. These
take account of the overall density of friendship ties
within the network (density), the likelihood to recipro-
cate friendship nominations (reciprocity), the tendency
for friends of friends to be friends (transitive triplets),
the propensity for closure in three-person friendships
(3-cycles), the propensity for individuals with more in-
coming friendship nominations to attract further friend-
ship nominations (in-degree popularity), the tendency
for individuals who name many others as friends to at-
tract friendship nominations (out-degree popularity),
and the inclination for students who name more friends
to generate even more out-going friendship ties over
time (out-degree activity). Control variables are age,
gender, and race/ethnicity effects on the number of
friends chosen, on the probability of being chosen as a
friend, and on the likelihood of friends being of similar
age, gender, and race/ethnicity.
Second, the alcohol use behavior evolution portion of
the model specifies a list of variables that could
Mundt et al. BMC Pediatrics 2012, 12:115 Page 4 of 10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/12/115
influence potential alcohol drinking behavior changes.
The model contains one main friendship-related influ-
ence component: the tendency for alcohol use to change
based on the average drinking of immediate friends.
Control variables include age, gender, race/ethnicity, par-
ental drinking, family bonding and linear and quadratic
shape effects modeling average drinking across the
network.
We employ both the Snijders-Baerveldt meta-analysis
(two-sided) test [40] and the Fisher's combination pro-
cedure [41] to test overall significance of the primary
and control variables across schools. The Snijders-
Baerveldt test makes inference about parameters in the
population of schools from which the studied schools
are considered to be a sample, while the Fisher's com-
bination procedure makes inference only about the
particular schools in the study. The Fisher's procedure
provides two tests, a right-sided test that the overall
variable effect is positive and a left-sided test that
examines if the overall variable effect is negative. To
control for the multiple testing (right and left), we
consider an effect to be significant if either of the
combination tests was significant at level p  .025. In
the case of conflicting Snijders-Baerveldt and Fisher's
combination test results, we lean toward accepting the
Fisher's test due to the variation in school sizes in the
sample.
Results
The sample consisted of 2,563 adolescents in grades 7
through 11 at Wave 1 of the Add Health survey
(Table 1). The participants included 1,301 (51%) boys
and 1262 (49%) girls. Mean age was 15.8 years. Two
fifths (39%) of respondents were minorities, with 16%
African American, 18% Hispanic, and 3% Asian. Forty-
four percent of the adolescents' parents reported drink-
ing alcohol in the past year. Over 70% of the adolescents
reported strong family bonding by indicating that they
had fun with their family quite a bit or very much. The
Wave 2 sample included 2,299 adolescents, 89.6 percent
of the original sample. Subjects lost to follow-up be-
tween Wave 1 and Wave 2 were more likely than Wave
2 respondents to be weekly alcohol users at Wave 1
(13% vs 9%, p = 0.040). There were no significant differ-
ences between respondents and non-respondents in age,
grade, gender, race/ethnicity, or family bonding.
Characteristics of the 13 schools in the study and alco-
hol use within the schools are reported in Table 2. The
mean number of students per school was 197. At Wave
1, the average number of friendship nominations to
other students in the same school was just over two per
student. Fifty percent of students reported no alcohol
use in the past 12 months at Wave 1. Alcohol abstainers
increased to 54 percent at Wave 2. The proportion of
monthly or weekly drinkers increased between waves,
from 18 percent at Wave 1 to 19.6 percent at Wave 2.
Just over half of the students reported the same drinking
frequency at both waves of the study. Drinking changes
from Wave 1 to Wave 2 were equally balanced with 24
percent of respondents reporting an increase in drinking
frequency and 24 percent reporting a decrease.
Table 3 presents the friendship network evolution from
Wave 1 to Wave 2. Friendship selection was associated
with similarity in alcohol consumption (p < .001), while
significant control mechanisms included reciprocity
(p < .001), transitive triplets (p < .001), 3-cycles (p = .012),
in-degree popularity (p < .001) and out-degree popularity
(p < .001). Students were more likely to choose as friends
other students of similar age (p = .002), gender (p < .001),
and race/ethnicity (p < .001). The number of out-going
friendship nominations was not associated with more
frequent alcohol consumption (adolescent alcohol use),
but greater number of in-coming friendship nominations
(friend alcohol use) was correlated with increased alco-
hol use (p = .006).

to alcohol use. Adolescents are more likely to nominate
as friends others who drink similarly to themselves,
which is consistent with a selection effect.
Figure 1 displays the range, 25th percentile, and 75th
percentile for  parameter estimates of friendship net-
work evolution parameters across the 13 schools in the
study over 1-year follow-up. The dominant features of
friendship evolution are reciprocity, transitivity, and age,
race, and alcohol use similarity.
Table 4 presents the results of the alcohol behavior
evolution portion of the model from Wave 1 to Wave 2.
Interestingly, more frequent drinking by immediate
friends was not significantly associated with increased
frequency of alcohol consumption (p = .139). The sto-
chastic actor-based model results do not support a sig-
nificant influence effect based on alcohol consumption.
In terms of the other covariates included in the model,
family bonding was a significant protective factor for
alcohol use ( = -0.06, p = .009). Frequency of parental al-
cohol use was not significantly associated with alcohol
consumption frequency by the adolescent (p = .220).
Discussion
The main objective of this investigation is to disentangle
the selection and influence processes governing peer
relationship's impact on adolescent alcohol use. To
achieve this goal, we utilize a stochastic actor-based
model to analyze the dynamic interplay of friendship for-
mation and alcohol behavior changes as they co-evolve
over time. Specifically, the study evaluates if similar alco-
hol use among friends is more likely a result of a ten-
dency for adolescents to choose friends with similar
alcohol use behavior, or as a result of teen influence on
each other's drinking.
The results demonstrate that selection effects in adoles-
cent friendships are based, in part, around commonalities

Figure 1 Boxplots of Selection and Influence Effects across Schools. Boxplots (Minimum, Maximum, 25th and 75th percentiles) for selection
and influence effect parameter estimates  across all schools (n = 13). Significant coefficients are labeled with an asterisk, where a co-efficient is
considered significant if the Snijders-Baerveldt test is less than 0.05 or the Fisher combination test is less than 0.025. For selection effects,
coefficients correspond to the log-odds of a friendship tie being present vs. absent if the selection criterion is met. For influence effects,
coefficients correspond to log-odds of a one-step increase in alcohol use frequency given a one-unit increase in the independent variable.

in alcohol use behavior. Homophily in friendship forma-
tion is also based on age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The
analysis controls for reciprocity (i.e. tendency to have re-
ciprocal friendships), transitivity (i.e. tendency to be-
come a friend of a friends' friend), and degree effects
(i.e., number of in-coming or out-going friendship nomi-
nations) as drivers of friendship formation. Our results
are in line with previous studies showing selection
effects to be a strong factor in alcohol use similarity
within adolescent friendships [27-30]. Our study is the
first to employ agent-based modeling for disentangling
peer selection and influence effects on alcohol use beha-
viors in a sample of U.S. middle and high school students.
The study findings offer little support for influence
effects among teens after the social ties with their peers
are in place. Our findings suggest that friends share
similar alcohol behaviors not because they adjust to the
behavior of one another, but because they selected each
other as friends to some degree because of similar alco-
hol use patterns, or of similarity in their behaviors asso-
ciated with alcohol use. The results are in contrast to
two European studies that identified both selection and
influence as significant in alcohol use similarities among
adolescent friends [29,30]. Our study population was
predominantly 10th and 11th graders, which may have
contributed to the differing outcomes. Prior studies
noted that friendship selection played a relatively stron-
ger role than peer influence when explaining similarity
of early adolescent friends' alcohol use and that influence
effects tended to diminish as students aged [27,30].
Interestingly, we found evidence of close family bonds,
defined here as having family fun, to be negatively asso-
ciated with alcohol intake. These data demonstrate that
strong family ties may offer protective benefits against
adolescent alcohol consumption.
Our results argue that homophily limits an adoles-
cent's social interactions in a way that has powerful
implications for the information they receive and the
attitudes they form toward alcohol use. Homophily cre-
ates strong divides in adolescent social environments,
which set the stage for reinforcing alcohol use norms.
More research is needed to evaluate the dynamics of so-
cial network and alcohol use change over time. Future
studies may need to explore how modifications of social
networks could affect adolescent alcohol abuse.
The strength of the study lies in its innovative meth-
odology, wealth of friendship variables, prospective de-
sign and large study sample size. The study also has
several limitations. First, adolescents were limited to
nominate only up to 10 friends which may have
obscured the friendship formation parameters in the
model. However, other studies show that students on
average report having four friends [27,30]. Second, the
analysis, by limiting itself to friendships within a school,
may not have captured all peers in the adolescent social
network. The average number of friends reported in the
sample was approximately two, fewer than in other stud-
ies [27,30]. This implies that potentially only some of
the influential peers were nominated, which limits the
conclusions that can be drawn. However, school-based
networks may be most pertinent for intervention efforts.
Third, alcohol use in the study was self-reported. How-
ever, self-reported alcohol use is generally considered to
be a valid measure among adolescents. Add Health used
a computer assisted data entry process for sensitive
questions such as alcohol and drug use to protect confi-
dentiality and enhance full reporting. Fourth, we only
examined alcohol, and not tobacco and other drug use,
in the analyses. It may be the case that peer selection oc-
curred not specifically for alcohol, but for other sub-
stance use as well. It is also possible that other peer
characteristics (e.g., peer delinquency) may precede ado-
lescent alcohol use and be related to both peer selection
and influence. Fifth, loss to follow up, in particular

among the heavier drinkers from Wave 1, may have
influenced the results. The increase in alcohol abstainers
over the course of one year, which is in contrast to lon-
gitudinal studies showing higher prevalence of drinking
with increasing age [42], suggests there may be limits to
the generalizability of the results. The 44% frequency of
parental alcohol consumption also raises questions about
the representativeness of the sample, as national surveys
indicate that 60%-70% of adults are alcohol drinkers
[42]. Parents of adolescents in the study may have
underreported their current drinking. Sixth, the selection
and influence processes may depend on contextual and
cultural aspects of the schools analyzed, which limits
generalizability to different school contexts and cultural
settings. Finally, the study does not directly address
whether the peer selection and influence processes oper-
ate in a similar manner for alcohol initiation or for heavy
drinking. Future studies could investigate the role of
peer interactions in alcohol initiation and heavy
drinking.
Conclusions
This investigation demonstrates that network selection,
or homophily, plays a prominent role in adolescent alco-
hol drinking similarities among friends. Understanding
the dynamics through which adolescent friendships and
alcohol use are initiated and maintained will allow for
designing adolescent alcohol abuse intervention strat-
egies to groups or subgroups of students. Our findings
may be of interest to parents, health care professionals,
school administrators, law enforcement and community
leaders who focus on alcohol prevention efforts.
