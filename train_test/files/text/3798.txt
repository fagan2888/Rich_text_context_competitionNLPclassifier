Introduction: Modern Human Resource
Management (HRM) Is Unsatisfactory
in Its Design and in How It Treats
Human Beings
All organizations are filled with people.1 They are often man-
aged like purely material resources that can be bought, sold,
modified, or discarded after use. However, from an ethical
standpoint,arepeoplereallyresources likeanyotherresource?
In this sense, the central question is not "can we treat human
being like objects," which is often the case, but how and why
not to do it. Moral philosophy from Kant (categorical impera-
tive) to Jonas (responsibility principle) has proposed concep-
tual frameworks to guide us in that direction. Furthermore,
the humanities and social sciences have specifically evolved
by clearly differentiating people from the rest of the physical
world (Giddens, 1976; for reasons, among others, grounded
in the hermeneutical dimension of human being and socio-
logical inquiry), as both their interiority and their will must be
taken into account. Although it is possible to objectify a per-
son, this does not result in a complete picture of a "human
being," a picture that could do justice to its richness and com-
plexity. There is a strong humanistic current in management
that have evolved in the 20th century from the human rela-
tions school to the development of organizational behavior
and organizational development with important figures such
as Likert, Maslow, Argyris, and McGregor. They still are read
and are sources of inspiration. However, many of their ideas
and suggestions are still not used widely in organizations
today. In this article, we will propose a critique of HRM,
guiding us toward a management of persons in organizational
settings, which we hope could be more ethical.
The context and content of HRM teaching are important
to consider. In North America and in other English-speaking
countries, HRM is mainly taught in management programs
offered through administration faculties, which often advo-
cate a unitary vision of HRM, and in industrial relations (IR)
programs through social science faculties, which offer a plu-
ralist vision of HRM. HRM is built as a discipline that is part
of the general field of management, which addresses the
operational dimensions in relation to human beings within
organizations. Thus, generally speaking, management deals
with organizational behavior, organizational theory, and stra-
tegic management.2 According to this point of view, HRM
implements the organizational strategy that is recognized by
current organizational theory, usually expressed in a form
that stems from the contingency theory rooted in a financial
conception of increasing shareholders' equity (Khurana,
2007). This legitimacy process draws also on a conservative
and often positivist approach to human behavior, despite
what organizational behavior has to offer. This could lead, in

From Resource to Human Being:
Toward Persons Management
Michel Fortier1 and Marie-Noëlle Albert1
Abstract
Modern human resource management (HRM) has been found to be unsatisfactory as a model and as a praxis concerning
human beings in organizations. This article proposes a conceptual change from resource to human being, which we define
as "persons management." After addressing what a person is (a subject navigating between individualism and collectivism; a
creative, ethical, and complex being), this text examines how persons can be managed, remembering that persons manage
persons. In a dialogical sense, they can help each other and work together, even if they are adversaries. In that sense, persons
management must strive to be sustainable at the human, organizational, and environmental levels. We examine certain
theoretical and conceptual aspects implied by this restructuring of the field.

our view, to serious problems of abuse and even inhumanity.
Not only does HRM in management seem dominated by a
one-dimensional conception of human beings (often the eco-
nomically conceived rational being), but it is also unhistori-
cal, non-critical, and geared to a privileged minority. If HRM
in IR appears more critical and more historically justified,
recent trends seem to demonstrate the same failings as those
found in HRM stemming from management because of the
increasingly accepted premise of the dominant "economism"
with its truncated vision of the "person." To our knowledge,
there is no HRM university program grounded in the radical
tradition of thought in management or IR schools.
A first observation that stems from those preceding com-
ments is that North American HRM, mainly centered on
practitioners, corresponds to the alignment of HRM practices
with strategic management and to its contribution toward the
profitability and use of the "best practices" in the industry as
a means of achieving those ends. Critical HRM, as is well
known, is European and more present in IR. Its supporters
challenge the unitary vision of their colleagues on the other
side of the Atlantic, denouncing the authoritarian and manip-
ulative character of an HRM designed only for the sole ben-
efit of management and shareholders. Greenwood (2002)
goes even further, claiming that ethics is almost absent from
current practices in modern HRM. Based on the works of
Legge (1996), she explains the existence of two very clear
tendencies among businesses: "hard" HRM, where human
beings are simply factors of production obtainable at the
lowest possible cost and disposable after usage; and "soft"
HRM, where the same results can be achieved in a more
subtle way through manipulation. Until very recently, few
treaties had been making ethics their central theme in the
general field of management and in the more specific branch
of managing human beings. Winstanley and Woodall (2000a,
2000b), Deckop (2006), Gilliland, Steiner, and Skarlicki
(2007), as well as Pinnington, Macklin, and Campbell
(2007), have all published collective works dealing explicitly
with moral issues raised by HRM practices and by manage-
ment, but a clear model challenging HRM has not emerged
from their efforts, nor has a coherent ethical stance.
Hence,3 to achieve a new model, a first step would be to
question HRM's very name (Inkson, 2008, has aptly ask this
question), for "[t]here are implicit assumptions inherent in
the conception underlying the expression human resource
management" (Dachler & Enderle, 1989, p. 598). We believe
that the passage from personnel management to the concep-
tualization of human beings as "resources" has paved the
way for renewed exploitation and abuse. The objectification
of the human being is most certainly possible, but it does not
mean that human beings should be treated mainly as objects.
Over the past few decades, several authors have also
expressed the wish to see HRM profoundly transformed
according to ethical criteria, even if there is no real consen-
sus on those ethical criteria (Greenwood, 2002; Legge, 2005;
Melé, 2008; Payne & Wayland, 1999; Pirson & Lawrence,
2010; Shultz & Brender-Ilan, 2004; Sloan & Gavin, 2010;
Winstanley & Woodall, 2000a, 2000b). From our point of
view, this has not resulted in a transformation of theorizing
or practices in HRM. To achieve those goals, we propose
switching from HRM to person management.
In defining person management, one must clarify what a
person is and how a person differs from a resource. This is not
a trivial difference because human beings viewed as resources
do not hold the same status and, above all, are not treated in the
same manner. Thus, we will compare what constitutes a per-
son with its counterpart in the resource tradition. Table 1
shows the elements and the structure of our proposition, which
must be understood as ideal types in the Weberian sense.

A Person Rather Than a Resource
What in fact is a "person"? In a sense, it is the opposite of a
centaur: we know what it is without ever being able to point one
out in the flesh. (Lenclud, 2009, p. 4)
The term person is widely present in common language.
However, although everyone seems to be familiar with its
meaning, grasping it specifically remains difficult. How do
we then truly define a person?
A Subject Rather Than an Object
If we consider a non-human resource, it is for us an object or
an instrument devoid of will power. Because of its human
nature, a person must be treated with respect and approached
differently from other resources (Melé, 2009c). A person is
first and foremost defined as a subject, that is, a source of
influence and intervention.According to Morin (1999), a sub-
ject "is both an obvious and mysterious notion" (p. 144).4
Nevertheless, it is possible to imagine a subject as the cause
of its own action because of the subject's interiority, freedom,
and personal autonomy (Melé, 2009c). Yet, this autonomy
and freedom cannot be separated from certain dependencies,
even from subservience (Morin, 1999). Subjects oscillate
between selfishness and altruism. On one hand, subjects can
be egocentric--placing themselves in the center of their own
world until they disintegrate at the time of death--while oth-
ers may mean nothing to them. On the other hand, subjects
can be altruistic, devoted to others and not seek all the atten-
tion (Morin, 1999). We will come back to this complexity of
the subject, and thus the person (cf. A Complex View of
Human Nature Rather Than a Reductionism View of Human
Nature section) and to these notions of altruism and selfish-
ness (cf. Oriented Toward Other, but Strategic Rather Than
Egoistic section).
A Flesh and Blood Being Rather Than a Category
HRM defined human beings as resources; this founding defi-
nition is theoretical categorization, which has profound prac-
tical impacts. A resource can be easily "tagged" and that
helps us know in which compartment we can "store" it for its
eventual use. A resource has no say in this regard. The same
could be done with a person even though a person is whole
and complete, in body and soul, and could object to our type
of categorization. In this respect, Mounier (1952) explains
what is a person:
One might expect that personalism would begin by defining the
person. But one can only define objects exterior to man, such as can
be put under observation. Here is my neighbour. He has a unique
feeling of his body, which I cannot have; but I can look at this body
from without, examine its dispositions, its heredity, its form, its
maladies; in short, I can treat it as an object of physiological,
medical, or other knowledge. He exercises functions, and there is a
functional order and a functional psychology, which I can apply to
the study of his case, although they are not he, the whole man in his
total reality. Moreover, and in the same way, he is a Frenchman, a
bourgeois, a socialist, a Catholic, etc. But he is not a Bernard
Chartier, he is Bernard Chartier. The thousand ways in which I can
distinguish him, as an example of a class may help me to understand
him, and above all to make use of him, they show me how
practically to behave towards him. But these are merely sections
taken, in each case, through one aspect of his existence. (p. xvii)
The term person comes from the Greek word prosôpon,
which means a face, a thing, an individual in the flesh, or a
concrete individual who is playing a role (Housset, 2007). It
is what others see of the self and of its identity (Vernant,
1996). This concrete individual and his or her identity make
this person a unique being. The conception adopted here of a
person rests more specifically on personalism. Indeed,
despite its heterogeneousness perspective, personalists agree
on a person's uniqueness and dignity (Melé, 2009c). More
precisely, personalism differs greatly from any other form of
collectivism, because, in a community, a person retains
autonomy and individual freedom. The person is not only an
individual who can simply be counted as part of a commu-
nity but rather a unique being that can neither be replaced nor
registered as abstraction (Melé, 2009c). A person also differs
from individual, because a person is not seen as someone
leading an isolated existence, linked to others solely through
a social contract. On the contrary, a person is seen as a social
being intrinsically related to others and leading an interde-
pendent existence (Melé, 2009c).
Consequently, a person is both unique and multifaceted,
different from others. Hence, a person cannot be understood
by observing only one facet, and though grasping all of them
may seem difficult, researchers and specialists must keep in
mind a person's multifaceted composition. Mintzberg (2009)
explains that individualism is a beautiful idea as it produces
incentives, promotes leadership, and fosters development.
However, persons are also social animals and need social
glue to unite them for their own good. This is what Mintzberg
calls "community." The community entails taking care of
work, colleagues, and one's place in the world. He positions
community spirit between individualistic leadership, on one
hand, and collective citizenship, on the other. This view of
community is very close to the one that Melé (2009c)
describes, in which a person shares with others common
goals and goods that belong to the community, while main-
taining a sense of individuality.
A Creative Being Rather Than an Underling
When we use a resource, we just want it to respect our plans or
proceedings. Material resources have no inner drives so to speak;
they cannot transform themselves, and they are passive and
mostly predictable. Person has already been proposed as a notion
fostering human wealth (from a psychological standpoint) from
4 SAGE Open
the perspective of enhancing capabilities (Giovanola, 2005,
2009). Imagination (the traditional madwoman of the house)
helps persons find original solutions to contingencies they are
faced within daily life. This possibility has always disturbed
rationalists who, at best, saw it as an aesthetical side to the mind
and, at worst, an irrational aspect that must be eliminated through
rigor and logic. Yet, imagination implies the possibility of mov-
ing forward, creating, innovating, and being visionary. Human
beings are able to gravitate toward an ideal even if they cannot
fully attain it and, what is more, they seem to be able to question
received ideas. Persons, as creative beings, are also intuitive and
base their actions on impulses, which lead them to reach their
goals (Shlien, D'Arifat, & Ducroux-Biass, 2007).Although their
actions are turned toward the future, which is to say toward their
goals, they are not mechanical. Being creative is more an instinc-
tive process, set apart from the intellect (Bergson, 1946). It is true
that "a creative mode of thought operates outside of the visible
limits of a problem. It requires a sense of freedom that enables a
person to focus on a problem by using his or her imagination"
(Shlien et al., 2007, p. 78). Persons are therefore subjects, which
imply that they are free, notably free to act in a creative way in
any given situation and according to their own views.As bureau-
cratic organizations tend to foster hierarchical procedures where
creativity is anathema, at least when it comes from below, this
poses a serious problem for anyone wishing to standardize and
control human behavior from above. In practice, the underlings
have the unfortunate habit of behaving unpredictably at times,
which leads to elaborate contraptions to control this nefarious
tendency. In that controlling sense, HRM could be seen as one of
the best models to date. Last the notion of "human richness"
(Giovanola, 2005) offers us a range of varied possibilities that
are tangibly embodied within capabilities, as meant by Sen
(2009) and Nussbaum (2011). It seems preferable to find all pos-
sible means to enable people to express their abilities in society
and within organizations and to try to reduce inequalities instead
of waiting for the perfect system, which may never come to exist.
It appears that, in its actual form, HRM is incapable of enabling
the full expression of human capabilities, whence the importance
of evolving toward persons management.
Oriented Toward Other, but Strategic Rather
Than Egoistic
Human resources, if we follow economic lore, are individual-
istic and selfish. More realistically, Flahault (2008), like
Morin (1973), demonstrates that a person can be altruistic and
selfish, as well as nice and mean to others. Consequently, it is
possible for selfishness to inhabit a person who is nonetheless
opening up to others. Instead of denying this phenomenon,
being aware of it and taking it into consideration might be
preferable. Human nature, as a concept, seems to condition a
person's ethical standpoint and moral behavior. From a
restricted view, human nature becomes one-
dimensional, whereas, from a broader view, human nature
can expand in a more complex and realistic fashion (e.g.,
Jonas's ethics of responsibility or Morin's ethics of complex-
ity). To be open to others, a person should follow certain rules
(Mounier, 1952): going out of the self--the antithesis of ego-
centrism, narcissism, and individualism; understanding--
stop seeing things from your personal point of view and try
instead to see them from the point of view of others, while
remaining yourself; taking upon oneself--sharing the des-
tiny, the trouble, the joy, or the task of one another; feel what
others feel; giving--a person's economy is an economy of
giving, not an economy of compensation or calculation; and
last, faithfulness. In fact, a person's trajectory is a constant
adventure, even though a person's general state continually
changes (Bergson, 1946). This faithfulness does not mean
being bound to a restricting agreement, but agreeing to a sus-
tainable relationship.These rules are similar to those described
by Melé (2009c). In this respect, the "Golden Rule" or "ethics
of reciprocity" require persons to put themselves in someone
else's shoes (Maxwell, 2003). Melé (2009c) also develops the
principle of human dignity: One can neither use nor treat per-
sons as objects. Others are treated like objects when they are
treated as absentees or used in an instrumental fashion. To
treat others as subjects, as a presence, means acknowledging
that they can neither be defined nor classified for good, that
they are inexhaustible and filled with hope (Mounier, 1952).
The value of openness to the Other was developed by Levinas
(1972/2006). He explained that openness to the Other can be
understood in three different ways. In the first, openness
relates to the essence of a human being opening up to be seen.
In the second, openness refers to consciousness opening up to
the other's presence. In the third, the one Levinas (1972/2006)
develops, "openness is the skin made vulnerable by insults
and wounds" (p. 105). This openness relates to sincerity,
which means "to embrace vulnerability, let go, and surren-
der." For this reason, one cannot ask someone else to sin-
cerely open up to others in this fashion, this process can only
be part of a very personal journey. Being open toward others
can encourage others to open up. Faÿ and Albert (2005) dis-
tinguish the logic of closing up from the logic of opening up
to others. When a person closes up, exchanges and reasoning
patterns become robot-like (Faÿ, 2004). Thus, closing up
becomes an impediment to persons management. This sin-
cere openness to others can reflect a humanistic leaning,
which focuses on the wealth that develops within relation-
ships. In this context, a person, the whole person, develops
actions that can be endlessly renewed, an approach that culti-
vates long-term closeness and friendship (and not only calcu-
lated trust).
Consequently, moral foundations depend on the whole-
ness of a being, that is, of a person. According to this per-
spective (Morin, 2004), ethics is rooted in the human trinity
of "person-society-species." A person is a psychological
being who voluntarily develops an ethical standpoint through
which to view the world. A person is also a member of a
given society that influences this person's very being and
moral standards. Last, a person is a complete biological
Fortier and Albert 5
being too, sharing common traits with other members of the
same species, such as gregariousness and a need for coopera-
tion. Ethics associated with this trinity is necessarily com-
plex as it emerges from dialogic relationships between
individual voluntarism, constraints, social permissions, and
the animal nature of a person. Furthermore, for human
beings, moral responsibility is a responsibility that cannot be
shared, transferred, or abandoned (Levinas, 1981).
A Complex View of Human Nature Rather Than
a Reductionism View of Human Nature
HRM uses a simplified model of human nature, often implicit
in its theorizing and not acknowledged either in practice.
This model is tailor-made to suit the demands of HRM stra-
tegic requirements. Contrary to this tendency, persons man-
agement put forth a conception grounded in complexity
theory. Morin (2001) explains that human beings are both
complex and interwoven into complexity. Human beings are
both similar and different from one another. A person is a
homo sapiens (a rational/wise being) and a homo demens (an
irrational/insane being), living with this limitless polariza-
tion and never knowing for certain when it will be one or the
other. Rationality is not localized, but rather scattered, satu-
rated with irrationality, and only instrumental. Rationality is
adapted to the practical finalities to which it is dedicated
(Morin, 1973). Persons are therefore complex beings in
whom the principles of complex thinking can be found
(Morin, 2001, 2005; Tsoukas, 2005). First, by being multi-
faceted, persons comply with the dialogic principle, which is
to say that persons make the existence of antagonisms pos-
sible. In this respect, dialogic is defined as
the complex unity that exists between two logics, entities, or
instances, that are complementary, concurrent and antagonistic,
and which feed on one another, cooperate, but are also in
opposition and battle each other. In dialogic, the oppositional
forces remain and constitute complex entities or phenomena
(there is no synthesis, which is the expected result in classical
dialectic). (Morin, 2001, p. 281)
"Oriented Toward Other, but Strategic Rather Than Egoistic"
section reflected this dialogic nature for humans, as we noted
that persons can be altruistic and selfish, as well as nice and
mean. Second, emergence is rendered possible through intu-
ition and creativity. This is where we find the recursive prin-
ciple, which open up new forms of participation for persons
in the organizational setting. Third, persons are also gov-
erned by the hologramatic principle ("the whole is in all the
parts, which constitute the whole and is more than the sum of
its parts"). In this sense, we find some of "Bernard Chartier"
in the French part of Bernard Chartier (cf. A Flesh and Blood
Being Rather Than a Category section). Fourth, persons are
interdependent, and so are their multiple facets. Finally, per-
sons' common goals (cf. A Flesh and Blood Being Rather
Than a Category section) follow the teleological principle.
This conception of human nature is a far cry from the reduc-
tionist view used in HRM and is best suited for a world in
constant mutation.
Principles of Person Management
Rather Than HRM
The term management comes from the Italian maneggiare,
which, in turn, comes from the Latin manidiare, which is
linked to Latin manus meaning "hand." The hand naturally
symbolizes force and power, so the word manus originally
meant the authority of the head of the family, the pater famil-
ias. The father had the power of life and death over the peo-
ple living under his roof, as well as imposing moral
obligations on them (Sampley, 2003). For these reasons, the
word "management" does not accurately fit the ideas we
defend. Yet, to date, we have not found a term likely to suit
our purposes, so for the moment, we use the expression per-
sons management. This expression refers to people manag-
ing other people, where a person is the common denominator
(i.e., basic unit) for all stakeholders involved in cooperation
and mutual aid, allowing the sustainable development of per-
sons and organizations.
Persons Manage Persons Rather Than Managers
Leading Employees
HRM helps to lead employees, and in this sense, managers
and employees are seen as categories (cf. A Flesh and Blood
Being Rather Than a Category section). This conception of
resource overlooks all the different facets of human beings.
Persons are unique while sharing common features. They
live together and may choose to be open or not be open to
others, revealing as such their complex, creative, ethical, and
political facets. Persons management is more specifically a
relationship where a person manages another person. It goes
beyond the traditional manager­employee relationship by
bringing together two persons who are unique and who share
a number of goals. They both occupy different functions,
interact with each other and with others (Weick, 1969/1979),
but they never cease to be persons, with all the complexity
that this involves. Both share the same community, which
means that they are not only involved in mutual relationships
but that they form a whole, a "we" (Melé, 2003). This "we"
neither automatically implies that these agree with each other
nor that they naturally envision reaching the same goals, but
rather that they share a certain number of common elements.
This humanistic way of managing persons evolves within a
humanistic organizational culture, which has four character-
istics (Kleinfeld, Cludts, & Melé, 2003). The first relates to
the recognition of humans' dignity and uniqueness, their
sociable character, and their capacity for self-development.
The second focuses on respect for persons and human rights.
6 SAGE Open
The third looks at the need to care for those around us, and
the fourth explores the need for management that encourages
public interest instead of self-interest. These characteristics
imply that persons are complex, unique, with common traits,
and are open to others. This also infers that organizations are
composed of persons (not resources) who have a number of
common goals. This humanist conception does not ignore
the fact that businesses need a set of formal mechanisms to
make profits and to adapt to markets and their natural and
social environments (Kleinfeld et al., 2003; Melé, 2009a).
Morin (1999) views persons as subjects oscillating
between selfishness and altruism. Selfishness contributes to
opportunism, whereas altruism calls for benevolence. Brun
(2008) defines benevolence as an attitude leading to desiring
goodness and facilitating problem-solving with real respect
for each person. To offer a genuine interest, benevolence
should be present in everyday situations and not only in pol-
icy statements. Brun (2008) explains that benevolence is not
a constraint but an opportunity and a choice leading to the
healthy growth of people and organization. Cappeletti,
Khalla, Noguera, Scouarnec, and Voynnet-Fourboul (2010)
think that the time has come to find a benevolent approach
compatible with economic constraints. They define benevo-
lence as the well-being of others, comparing it with charity,
which also promotes well-being, but which does not take
into account others' true motivations. Benevolence can,
therefore, operate according to person management perspec-
tive in which selfish and altruistic human beings can sin-
cerely open up to others. It is only in the presence of sincere
openness that benevolence can exist. However, because of
the complex nature of persons, one must be clever and pre-
vent the subordination of one's altruistic behaviors to others'
selfish behaviors.
Employees as Collaborators Rather Than
Employees as Subordinates
Most jurisdictions in advanced societies defined the hired
people in organizations either as officers or as subordinates.
This entails specific rights and duties for all, but the rights
portion of the legal contract is rather thin for the subordinates
who must obey the officers of the corporation. If civil society
is democratic as an institution, most organizations in busi-
ness and government are not. In the market economic sys-
tem, competition is the predominantly favored mechanism
thought to ensure regulation, within and between companies,
with wealth being the ultimate goal to strive for. Yet, compe-
tition is far from being the only significant and efficient
mechanism capable of ensuring economic and social regula-
tion. One of the great characteristics of constructs relative to
collective actions (organization), according to Crozier and
Friedberg (1980), is the actors' mutual adjustment within the
strategy. If confrontation is a possibility, it is rarely the first
choice. Thus, mutual aid stands as an important factor of
resilience for those often submitted to important stressors in
their work-related environment. A clear shift from patriar-
chal and warlike values to more feminine ones based on
sharing, mutual aid, and, above all, on concern for others, the
very foundation of ethics (Ricoeur, 1995) is also emerging
with many new ventures. One must recall that Ricoeur's def-
inition of ethical ambitions is the aim of a "good life" with
and for others, inside fair institutions. Consequently, if com-
petition is sometimes an acceptable mechanism, its omni-
presence or even prevalence can seriously slow down all
ethical developments. Furthermore, if employees are pitted
against each other in an endless competition for economic
survival where they are only hands executing orders obedi-
ently, the results could be counterproductive to say the least.
As Khurana (2007) points out, the alignment of modern
management on a purely financial conception of strategic
management relies on a very specific definition of human
nature and consistent ethics. The highly controversial text of
Jensen and Meckling (1994) on "The Nature of Man" pre-
sented human nature triumphantly filled with selfishness,
calculation, and some form of rationality. This conception of
persons seems to dominate in strategic management circles,
even though it is criticized (Mintzberg, Simons, & Basu,
2002) as being incompatible with companies' reality. A play-
er's economical selfishness abstractly built, shall we say,
outside of physical life presents a psychological and social
horizon too narrow for human nature to be based on. Thus all
employees of a giving organization are best understood as
collaborators with different roles and talents, not as cogs in a
well-oiled machine or as subordinates ordained along a hier-
archical chain of command. Furthermore, we could picture
all collaborators as valued human beings from the humblest
janitor, to the receptionist and up to the manager who must
help them do their work and not be served by them like a
noble of old.
An Expanded View of Stakeholders Rather Than
a Narrow One
In HRM, the stakeholder theory has been cited as an example
of how complex and conflicting political relations can be
within organizations (Ferrary, 2009). Hence, in general, few
stakeholders, except employees and managers, are considered
important topics of research for the discipline. However, the
stakeholder's perspective has become one of the pillars of
business ethics over time. As a result, stakeholder theory had
given a voice to persons who often struggle to be heard. We
adopt here the most extensive conception of stakeholder man-
agement and considered all persons affected by the organiza-
tion as within our field of interest. We will not extend further
on our comments regarding this aspect, except to note a trend
in the recent evolution of the workforce in Western societies.
One of the most salient elements in the present-day context of
person's management is that the workforce is transforming
toward diversity. This situation commands the management of
diversity and welcomes tolerance of otherness. Over the past
Fortier and Albert 7
few decades, we have witnessed the development of a femi-
nine and masculine multiethnic workforce (even transgender
in some countries), of all ages, social environments, with vari-
ous curricula, and so on. The monolithic nature of the work-
force seems to belong to the past, but tensions subsist even
though laws in several countries prohibit discrimination. There
is, therefore, a need to become more sensitive to difference
and to adopt management styles, which reflect that difference.
Last, workers are also consumers and that dimension cannot
be excluded from our conception of germane topics in person
management as a human life must not be conceived in isolated
fragments (the employee at work) but constituted of many
inter-related dimensions (employee, consumer, parent, citizen,
player, etc.; see also Cleveland, Byrne, & Cavanagh, 2015).
A Generalist View Instead of a Specialist View
Kaufman (2007) in his review of the historical evolution of
the field reminds us that in the personnel management era, a
generalist stance was the norm:
It goes on to say that the term "personnel" as used in the USA
stresses that the function is "recognized as part of the
Management" and that personnel is not just a staff function but
includes "anyone who supervise employees, from the assistant
foreman to the president." (p. 25)
In contrast, HRM has evolved and defined itself as a special-
ized field of study, a kind of technocratic solution to the
human "problem" in organizations. A question could then be
asked: Are the other business specialties not concerned with
human beings? Nevertheless, being the specialist of the
human "variety" of resources, hopefully on par with the
other organizational resource specialists, entails professional
opportunities and financial privileges. However, this has
been gained at a price far too high in our view: the dehuman-
izing of organization, the reification of the discipline, and the
subservience to economic elites often oblivious to those not
in the fold. We believe that person management is best under-
stood as the management of management and calls, for that
reason, for a generalist stance, which embraces all the aspects
of management. Organizations are many things, as Morgan
(1986) has aptly shown, but fundamentally it boils down to a
tool at the service of humanity; not the other way around. In
becoming a specialty of "the using up of humans as resources,
among others," HRM is oblivious to its most noble aims, the
complexities, and the possibilities implied by them, which,
we insist, is a tool for the betterment of human beings. In that
sense, it must be reformed in a profound way.
Ethical Comprehension of Behavior Rather Than
Moralizing of Behavior
From our prior comments, we can conclude that we need a
nuanced ethical comprehension of human behavior and
endeavor in organizations. But more often than not, what we
observe in HRM practices is a moralization5 of the actions of
the participants in organizational life, mostly directed to
lower level employees and aimed at achieving purely eco-
nomic goals. The flourishing of behavioral codes of conduct,
of so called ethical codes (which are purely deontological, if
not legal, in their conception and application), cannot replace
the moral subject, that is, a person. Human beings are the
sole repository of moral impulse, moral imagination, and
moral conduct. What must be put forward is the possibility of
developing and using, beyond bureaucratic control, the
moral compass guiding persons. All the ethical codes in the
world will be of no avail if there are no moral human beings
to comprehend them, interpret them, and correct them as the
situation commands. We are conscious that some people
cherish the idea that human being cannot be moral if they are
not constrained to be.6 It is not a belief we share, as history
had amply proven otherwise; on the contrary, human beings
are the only and last moral bastions. Following the rules
blindly had resulted in all sorts of disastrous and inhuman
deeds.7 This is not to say that rules are not important but that
they alone cannot be the solution. We need persons with real
ethical understanding, not the factice or cosmetic window
dressing offered by many ethical codes, which is all the
morality some organizations have to offer (Pinnington et al.,
2007).
Some Operational Characteristics
Following our discussion on principles used to manage per-
sons, we will now look at elements characterizing implemen-
tation, which will help understand how person management
could distinguished itself from HRM in concrete organiza-
tions. We are not exhaustive in this demonstration.8 We will
present only a few salient examples, which are impartiality,
the sharing of advantages and risks, the use of tools, the
implied time horizon, the hidden costs, and, as a synthesis,
the articulation of different types of logic.
Impartiality in Human Relation Rather Than
Impersonality
Managers and employees have traditionally had an imper-
sonal and task-oriented relationship with one another. This
impersonality was put forth to avoid nepotism and favorit-
ism. Impersonality refers to an abstraction of the person.
With this impersonality, a human is not a subject, but instead
an object, and persons need to be recognized as subjects. So,
to avoid favoritism, we have to use another principle of
action, which is not fraught with difficulty like impersonal-
ity. Duhamel (2003) distinguishes impartiality from imper-
sonality. Impartiality does not require that you be friends or
that you make friends, but if you do have friends, you are
linked to them through social obligations that fall under the
criterion of impartiality. Özler and Buyukarslan (2011)
8 SAGE Open
define impartiality as the opposite of favoritism. It combines
individualist and collectivist dimensions (like the notion of
the person). The difference between impersonality and
impartiality is not just conceptual. In a practical way, imper-
sonality puts processes at the center of organizations and
makes them responsible for all actions. As Bauman (1994)
have aptly commented, if things go wrong within an organi-
zation where the responsibility is impersonal, the result is
astonishing: In practice, nobody is held responsible if every-
one has followed the rules. When nobody feels responsible,
horrible deeds could be accomplished. Impartiality allows
person to be responsible and promotes relationship between
different persons, not necessarily friendship, but openness to
others.
Sharing of Advantages and Risks Rather Than
Asymmetrical Power and Advantages
Much has been said about the financial risks incurred by
entrepreneurs and investors in business projects. In this mat-
ter, the most adverse outcome is bankruptcy, which happens
quite frequently with small businesses. Yet, employees also
experience risks and inconveniences. Senior executives are
in a distinctive situation because they can negotiate consid-
erable advantages that often shelter them from the basic
contingencies of everyday life. The situation of "mere"
employees is strikingly different. Certain employees risk
their health, even their lives. Each year, in every country,
work-related accidents and deaths paint a sad picture. When
we add employees who have mental health problems in the
workplace, it seems that any financial compensation would
seem negligible for those facing these risks. But work is
rarely a choice; it's a necessity for most people. We must
also take into account the inconveniences and sacrifices
necessary for employees to obtain a position, not to mention
to keep it. Thus, employees must be mobile and available;
they must accept the fact that work ties are weak and that
they will have to cope with the business cycle. Although the
notion of suffering at work has long interested specialists,
few have highlighted the advantages of pleasant working
conditions. It is possible that the Puritan attitude, which
stemmed from Protestant work ethics, has held up the devel-
opment of a work organization focused on the well-being of
its employees, and not solely on work discipline as it is usu-
ally understood (Barbash, 1984). Relationships with col-
leagues have long been recognized as a key factor of
resilience in the workplace (Brun, 2002). Contrary to com-
petitive situations in which workers are pitted "against"
each other, cooperation and participation foster interper-
sonal ties, which permit the unfolding of positive effects
through supportive social relationships. In the same way,
hierarchal relationships within the workplace provide a
plethora of possibilities, which stems from the style of lead-
ership adopted, a style that must be chosen to induce respect
and morality toward the employees.
Considering the set of mental and physical health factors,
entailed by the psychosocial factors of work within firms, we
are forced to conclude that one must have a global and ethi-
cal vision to use the tools to manage employees, from job
attribution to performance appreciation. Only a wide per-
spective enables corrections to be made to current practices
and makes it possible to go beyond traditional HRM.
Traditional HRM has proven to be successful in terms of
increasing a firm's sales figures, but demonstrates far less
success in terms of increasing human well-being. A good
start would be to better balance all the advantages and disad-
vantages encountered by working in organization (Cleveland
et al., 2015).
Tools as Guide and Not as Ends in Themselves
HRM in practice is mainly concerned with tools as it is fash-
ioned as a bureaucratic solution to the human problem in
organizations. In keeping with this spirit, Pettersen (2000)
explains how to develop and validate measurement instru-
ments to assess human potential in organizations. He advo-
cates a mechanistic approach to lessen the judgment and
interpretation of the persons building and using the tool. This
conception comes close to the computer metaphor (Morgan,
1986). Yet, if one wants to be able to take into account the
complexity of persons and their environment, it would be
preferable to change metaphors. An alternative metaphor
founded on the concept of enaction may better take into
account at the same time the subjective character of the sub-
ject as well as the objective character of the object. This
would allow persons to use the tools as guides and use their
professional judgment to act. The tools are representations of
a reality, but they are not the reality (the map is not the terri-
tory). Although these representations are useful for under-
standing reality, they should leave room for professional
judgment. Acting within the computer metaphor may lead to
being less responsible, because, in this case, the action does
not depend on reflection but on an automatic procedure. The
actor is not responsible for the action because he has not
made a decision; rather, he has applied a procedure mechani-
cally. In this instance, the tool, which can be seen at the out-
set as a way of attaining finality, can become an end unto
itself. This change from medium to end makes it possible to
disregard the essential finality. A mechanistic approach,
through its determinism, puts emphasis on the fulfillment of
prefixed criteria. However, complex situations (the same is
true of persons) shed light on unexpected elements. This
unpredictability can help reach the original finalities differ-
ently from the way previously programmed. Must we favor
the ends we strive to reach or stick to the ways we have cho-
sen for reaching them? Adopting logic based on finalities
rather than on processes would seem to us preferable for
ordering priorities. The professionalism of managers allows
them to use their judgment in attaining their goal because
they are guided, not blinded, by management tools. This
Fortier and Albert 9
could be embraced by all persons working in organizational
setting.
Long-Term Orientation (Sustainable) Rather Than
Short-Term Orientation
For Pirson and Lawrence (2010), the "economic man"
engages only in short-term transactions because he acts on
opportunities. At its extreme, it is predatory behavior often
founded on individualistic premises. In contrast, humanist
philosophers envision the long-term relationships with oth-
ers as a central element for human beings, a condition stem-
ming from "being together" in this world. Management, as
Melé (2009a) points out, is often guided by the idea that each
person is different and must be treated according to her or his
qualities and personality. Even if these concepts apply mainly
to the management of talents, it is possible that they will
become the key to the success of organizations, leading to
humanistic and economic approaches complementing each
other (Pirson & Lawrence, 2010). Beaupré, Cloutier,
Gendron, Jiménez, and Morin (2008) explain that sustain-
able development does not condemn all economic activity; it
means considering this activity differently, taking into
account the limits of both the environment and the develop-
mental aspirations of individuals and organizations.
According to these authors, complying with these precepts of
corporate social responsibility (CSR) can have positive con-
sequences on organizational health. Nevertheless, Beaupré
et al. notes that the implementation of CSR practices and sus-
tainable development had not really helped integrating the
human dimension at the heart of values and principles of
social responsibility within organizations. Consequently,
introducing CSR and sustainable development principles
into HRM practices remains in an embryonic state or is only
slowly being implemented in businesses. Plinio (2009)
defines the sustainable performance of organizations as the
performance that makes the attainment of short-term objec-
tives possible while remaining focused on long-term objec-
tives. Therefore, all results, short term as well as long term,
increase the benefits for the organization, the parties
involved, and our civil society. Delios (2010) explains that
organizational leaders should proactively modify the nature
of their competitive environment by promoting social
responsibility. Finally, Marchington (2015) have recently
noted that HRM is neglecting the long-term perspective in
looking up too much on the hierarchy and with his narrow
focus on performance goals even if unfortunate conse-
quences will follow for its practitioners.
Garriga and Melé (2004) have classified the different
CSR conceptions into several categories: instrumental,
political, integrative, and ethical. The CSR advocated by
Beaupré et al. (2008) can be identified with the fourth group,
the ethical one. This corresponds to person management
based simultaneously on ethics and sustainability. Thus, by
rethinking management sciences according to a humanist
perspective, we are looking at the long-term horizon even
though it is possible to have partial objectives helpful in
attaining ulterior goals (Melé, 2009b). The CSR, whatever
its shape, is an integral part of an organization's strategy. To
work, such a strategy should be part of the common goals
shared by the members of the organization, even though the
intent might change over time. This sustainable develop-
ment of persons can also help reduce costs (often hidden
costs) associated with turnover, absenteeism, and so on.
Taking Into Consideration Hidden Costs Not Just
the Obvious One
Managing persons with little benevolence may seem to
increase performance in the short term. For example, Melé
(2009a) explains that massive layoffs and relocating facto-
ries in view of saving money on salaries, as well as other
practices, illustrate how powerful and widespread this con-
ception of short-term economics is. Yet, practices that do not
emphasize persons management can generate substantial
hidden costs, as defined by Savall and Zardet (2008). For
example, based on the literature regarding work-related
stress, Leung, Skitmore, and Chan (2007) re-explore the dif-
ferent kinds of stressors. There are personal stressors, task-
related stressors, organizational stressors, and physical
stressors. It is therefore possible to observe that only the per-
sonal stressors (type A behavior, for example), cannot be
lessened through an ethical and responsible management of
persons. Persons management means, among other things,
taking into consideration almost all of the stressors to
decrease their impact. The American Institute of Stress esti-
mates that work-related stress costs American companies
more than US$300 billion per year (Bishara & Schipani,
2009). In fact, stress can lead to absenteeism, employee turn-
over, mistakes, reduced productivity, increased professional
burnouts, lower morale, as well as higher risks of drug and
alcohol use, violence at work, and harassment (Bishara &
Schipani, 2009; Brown & Mitchell, 2010). While manage-
ment often looks carefully at the costs related to their divi-
sion, numerous hidden costs are not considered (Garman,
Corbett, Grady, & Benesh, 2005). For example, according to
O'Connell and Kung (2007), there are three main compo-
nents associated with retention costs not often calculated:
staffing, vacation, and training. Cascio (1999) defines four
types of hidden costs: separation, replacement, training, and
the difference in the performance between those who have
left and their replacements. Few studies have measured these
costs, but Hillmer, Hillmer, and McRoberts (2004) evaluate
the "real costs" of turnover in call centers, which were major.
However, even if it is obvious that employee turnover gener-
ates other types of hidden costs, the difficulty of evaluating
them makes it also difficult to document them. Following
this lead, recent studies have focused on the hidden costs of
absenteeism, such as Cascio and Boudreau (2010). Even if
many authors agree that there are costs generated by
10 SAGE Open
presenteeism, this type of cost is even less examined than the
first two we cited. The studies evaluating costs are sparse,
because it is difficult to quantify the amount of money that
organizations could save by reducing employee turnover,
absenteeism, and other adverse effects of stressors (Bishara
& Schipani, 2009). But these costs could nevertheless be
estimated important, and HRM does not even acknowledge
them most of the time. Person management tries to obtain
estimates of all the costs and not only those traditionally
considered.
Articulating Different Logics Rather Than
Shareholder Value Maximization
Persons use points of view, ways of thinking, and values,
which convey a genuine strategy and way of understanding
organizational life. These different logic perspectives can
sometimes converge, but they are frequently divergent, if not
contradictory. Morgan (1986, as well as Burrell & Morgan,
1979), in presenting the political nature of the organization,
underlines the three all-important ideologies that are in direct
opposition within the organizational space, ideologies
emphasizing the different types of logic that sustain persons
as strategic actors. Therefore, the unitary vision, often fos-
tered by owners and top managers, denies that there are dif-
ferences in interests and power, and that conflicts are inherent
in the organization of work. Unlike the previous perspective,
the radical perspective challenges not only a difference in
interests at work and power relationships but also the legiti-
macy of the claims made by leaders in market economies.
The pluralist vision, which is sometimes seen as an awkward
reformist perspective, favors the multiple stakeholder per-
spective. This view recognizes the plural nature of interests
and forms of power in organizations and accepts the conflict-
ing nature of the relationships between the protagonists that
this entails. Yet, this perspective opens the door for an even-
tual agreement between the actors. Recently, Buren,
Greenwood, and Sheenan (2011) examine the hypotheses
behind the strategic management of the unitary perspective,
which informs the conception of many HRM practitioners.
Their analysis of HRM reflects Khurana's (2007) insights for
management as a whole. It is useful to remind the reader that
Khurana, after having traced the history of major North
American schools of management, was deeply concerned
about the fact that the high ideals that had spurred on the
creators of these schools had not resulted in a professional-
ization of management. On the contrary, given the alignment
of the financial strategy on the valorization of shareholders'
assets since the early 1980s, these schools of management
had become mercenary training camps. In addition, the idea
of taking into account employees as primary stakeholders
seems to have been abandoned, and the pluralist vision that
recognizes the differences between organizational actors
also appears, in practice, to have been dropped. In our view,
the choice we face consists either of adopting the uncertain
revolution implied by the radical partisans of change or a
return to a revived pluralist view. We tend to favor the plural-
ist conception as a guide for person management as it appears
to be grounded more solidly in business practices and from
an ethical point of view.
Conclusion
Based on numerous comments about the inadequacies and
limits of present-day HRM, in particular its alignment with
strategic management, which tends to commodify humans to
being in the sole service of maximizing shareholders' assets,
we proposed that the real nature of human "resources" must
be urgently reconceptualized. It appears that human beings
are not like other resources or assets of the organization. In
this sense, the notion of the "person" provides us with an
important and complex conception of the organizational
actors, a conception, which can serve as the foundations of
renewed practices. It may also point out to new directions in
helping emancipate human beings through a more humanis-
tic management. In that sense, persons management may
also be seen as an ideal type in the Weberian sense. Even if it
did not fully exist in reality, it serves as a guide to improve
our practices.

Notes
1. The plural of person is people in English. In Human Resources,
including in the Canadian Government, people management
is used, and not persons management. Terminologically, per-
son is considered very impersonal and cold, and is just a term
used in legal writing. However, people management possesses
a meaning which does not convey what we are talking about
here. Person in its singular and plural use to describe human
beings in organization offer a more complex and nuance pic-
ture as Melé (2012) shows in a recent article.
2. For each domain, "popular" textbooks in a university setting
make it possible to define the conception being transmitted; for
example, in organizational behavior (McShane & Steen, 2008),
organizational theory (Hodge, Anthony, & Gales, 2002), and
strategic management (Dess, Lumpkin, & Eisner, 2009).
3. It could be argued that changing the name human resource
management (HRM) for person management does not change
anything in the field. We are in accord with the spirit of this
comment. However, if we want to change something, we must
start from somewhere. Language games are not innocuous
and have the potential to change our thinking and our actions
(see, for instance, Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). Human beings in
organizational setting have been characterized in many ways,
Fortier and Albert 11
and this fact must be taken into account. Wren and Bedeian
(2009) in outlining the evolution of managerial thought help
us remember that we have talked in the past of people manage-
ment, personnel management, the human factor, human rela-
tions, the social person, before settling for HRM where human
beings (persons) are conceived primarily as assets (for the use
of other human beings [persons]). In the same vein, Kaufman
(2007) insists on the historical duality in coming to term with
the human factor that is represented in the managerial tradition
and the industrial relations (IR) school. Those strands fuses
together in HRM around the idea that we need to go from a
cost conception of persons in organization to an assets con-
ception. HRM was in that sense viewed justly as a progress;
however, the strategic shift of the 80s and 90s does not have
delivered what was hope for. Suggesting "persons manage-
ment" is a proposal to go beyond the ambiguity of HRM label.

5. Moralization is imposing, controlling, and judging the moral
behavior of others while not be constrained by the same rules.
This offers no leeway for the person to use his own moral judg-
ment, only rules to follow.

1994) about the lack of faith in human morality not guided
by "legislators," but also his presentation of bureaucratic and
business ethics hindrance to morality. "In other words, no one
else but the moral person themselves must take responsibility
for their own moral responsibility" (Bauman, 1994, p. 14).
