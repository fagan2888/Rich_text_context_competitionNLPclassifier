Abstract
Background: Hypertension is a major contributing factor to the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease in India. Small
studies suggest high, and increasing, prevalence especially in urban areas, with poor detection and management, but
national data has been lacking. The aim of the current study was to use nationally-representative survey data to examine
socio-demographic inequalities in the prevalence, diagnosis and management of hypertension in Indian adults.
Methods: Using data on self-reported diagnosis and treatment, and blood pressure measurement, collected from 12,198
respondents aged 18+ in the 2007 WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health in India, factors associated with
prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension were investigated.
Results: 22% men and 26% women had hypertension; prevalence increased steeply with body mass index (,18.5 kg/m2:
18% men, 21% women; 25-29.9 kg/m2: 35% men, 35% women), was higher in the least poor vs. poorest (men: odds ratio
(95%CI) 1.82 (1.20 to 2.76); women: 1.40 (1.08 to 1.81)), urban vs. rural men (1.64 (1.19 to 2.25)), and men recently vs. never
using alcohol (1.96 (1.40 to 2.76)). Over half the hypertension in women, and 70% in men, was undetected with particularly
poor detection rates in young urban men, and in poorer households. Two-thirds of men and women with detected
hypertension were treated. Two-thirds of women treated had their hypertension controlled, irrespective of urban/rural
setting or wealth. Adequate blood pressure control was sub-optimal in urban men.
Conclusion: Hypertension is very common in India, even among underweight adults and those of lower socioeconomic
position. Improved detection is needed to reduce the burden of disease attributable to hypertension. Levels of treatment
and control are relatively good, particularly in women, although urban men require more careful attention.

Introduction
Hypertension is a major contributing factor to the current
epidemic of cardiovascular disease in India and many other low-
and middle-income countries [1,2]. The global burden of
hypertension was estimated to be close to 1 billion adults in
2000, and predicted to increase to 1.56 billion by 2025 [3].
Worldwide, in excess of 7 million deaths annually may be
attributable to hypertension [4] which is the third most important
cause of the global burden of disease [5]. There is marked
variation in levels of mean systolic blood pressure between
countries, with highest levels evident in low- and middle-income
countries, and a small decrease in mean systolic blood pressure
globally since 1980, although the trends varied across regions [6].
Hypertension tends to be inversely related to socioeconomic
position in high income countries [7] with the opposite often being
the case in low- and middle-income countries [8]. Only in the later
stages of the epidemiological transition does the burden of chronic
disease including hypertension shift from higher to lower
socioeconomic groups [2,9]. A high and increasing prevalence of
hypertension in both rural and urban areas of India has been
reported in recent studies [10,11] with higher prevalence in urban
than rural areas and intermediate levels among migrants [12].
Detection and effective management of hypertension decreases
the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease
and heart failure. Knowledge about the prevalence and social
patterning of hypertension is essential for informing the public
health effort to control hypertension in the community. In the US
and other high-income countries in the 1970s what has become
known as `the rule of halves' found that only half of adults with
hypertension were diagnosed, only half of those diagnosed were
treated, and only half of those treated were well controlled [13,14].
While detection and treatment has improved in many high-income
countries over recent decades good control remains low [15,16].
Recent small scale and local studies show that the rule of halves
applies in India where detection, treatment and control of

hypertension remain inadequate [11,17­19]. However there is an
urgent need for national data to confirm the situation. With the
current epidemic in chronic disease, primarily affecting older
people, the gap in the evidence base has become only too
apparent. The nationally-representative surveys conducted in the
WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE)
programme (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/sage/cohorts/en/
index2.html) are beginning to fill this gap by collecting detailed
information on the health and well-being of adult populations and
the ageing process [20,21]. Using self-reports of hypertension
diagnosis and treatment, in addition to blood pressure measure-
ment, from the 2007 SAGE survey in India, we examined socio-
demographic inequalities in the prevalence, diagnosis and
management of hypertension in Indian adults and assessed `the
rule of halves' for detection, treatment and control.
Methods
Ethics statement
Ethical approval was not required for this analysis of
anonymised secondary data. The 2007 SAGE Wave 1 survey of
India received approval from the review board of the International
Institute for Population Sciences in Mumbai, India. Respondents
provided informed consent to participate in the survey. A standard
consent form, approved by the World Health Organization ethics
review committee, was read to the respondent in the respondent's
language. If the respondent agreed to participate in the survey,
and if s/he was literate, the form was provided to him/her to
peruse and sign and was countersigned by the interviewer. If the
respondent was illiterate and gave consent to participate, the
interviewer confirmed this consent and signed on the form that the
form had been read to the respondent, that s/he had understood
the study and had agreed to participate. This procedure was
approved by the review board of the International Institute for
Population Sciences.
This analysis uses data collected in the 2007 SAGE Wave 1
survey of India (conducted by the International Institute for
Population Sciences, Mumbai with the World Health Organiza-
tion, Geneva). The SAGE survey took representative samples of
six states in India (Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,
Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal) which can be modelled to a
nationally representative sample. The survey consisted of a large
sample of people aged 50 years and older and a smaller
comparative sample aged 18­49 years, 12,198 respondents
(4,717 men, 7,481 women) in total. The SAGE dataset is
described in full elsewhere [20,22] and the questionnaires can be
found at http://www.who.int/healthinfo/sage/cohorts/en/index2.html
(accessed 23 July 2013). SAGE Wave 1 data are available in the
public domain at the same location.
The survey includes 3 types of information on hypertension.
1. Blood pressure (BP) measurement at physical examination,
measured in the left wrist using a Boso Medistar Wrist Blood
Pressure Monitor Model S (which avoids the need for different
cuff sizes necessary with blood pressure measured in the upper
arm). Validation studies of similar wrist blood pressure
monitoring devices indicate they are capable of providing
accurate measurements [23,24] but that the position of the arm
in relation to the heart is critical (http://www.bhsoc.org/bp-
monitors/bp-monitors/). Respondents were asked to remain
seated with legs uncrossed, positioning their arm level with
their heart, taking 3 deep slow breaths before measurement
started and then remaining relaxed and still while their BP was

measured three times with at least one minute between each
measurement [22].
2. Later in the interview respondents were asked: Have you ever
been diagnosed with high BP (hypertension)?
3. Those answering `yes' were asked: Have you been taking any
medications or other treatment for it during a) the last 2 weeks?
b) the last 12 months? (The questionnaire stated `Other
treatment might include weight loss program or change in
eating habits').
We calculated mean systolic and diastolic BP using all three BP
readings and where systolic . = 140 mmHg and/or diastolic
. = 90 mmHg respondents were classified as having high BP at
exam in accordance with guidelines [25]. We defined hypertension
as high BP at exam and/or self-reported diagnosis; this included
all those on treatment as only respondents reporting diagnosis
were asked about treatment. Treatment was defined as being on
medication or other treatment in the past 12 months. For
respondents reporting diagnosis, or diagnosis and treatment, we
examined whether their hypertension was controlled, defined as
systolic BP ,140 mmHg and diastolic ,90 mmHg. The rule of
halves for detection, treatment and control was assessed by
splitting hypertension into the following proportions i) undiag-
nosed and uncontrolled (i.e. high BP at exam, but diagnosis not
reported), ii) diagnosed but uncontrolled (i.e. high BP, diagnosis
reported), and iii) controlled (i.e. diagnosis reported, BP not high).
Both ii) and iii) were further sub-divided into those reporting being
on treatment or not.
Socio-demographic and risk factors considered were respon-
dents' area of residence (urban; rural); age; sex; religion (Hindu;
Muslim; other religion); caste (scheduled tribe; scheduled caste;
other backward caste; other); highest level of education completed
(no formal education; less than primary school; primary school
completed; secondary school completed; high school (or equiva-
lent) completed; above high school); body mass index (BMI,
,18.5, 18.52, 23.02, 25.02, 30.0+ kg/m2 [26]) calculated from
height and weight measurements where both values were non-
missing; alcohol consumption (recent use (in last 30 days), used but
not recently, never used); household wealth index (provided in
dataset, derived using WHO standard approach to estimating
permanent income from survey data on household ownership of
durable goods, neighbourhood and dwelling characteristics, and
access to water, sanitation, electricity etc [27]).
Survey response was high with 92% of the eligible persons
contacted completing the interviews. Respondents with complete
interviews and complete hypertension data were included in the
analysis. Hypertension data was considered complete if the
respondent had all three BP measurements and had answered
yes or no when asked if ever diagnosed with high BP
(hypertension). We examined whether respondents with complete
hypertension data differed from those with incomplete hyperten-
sion data.
Outcome variables were mean systolic and diastolic BP, high BP
at examination, self-reported diagnosis and treatment of hyper-
tension, any indication of hypertension (that is, high BP at exam
and/or self-reported diagnosis of hypertension), and control of
hypertension. We explored the association between outcome
variables and age, sex and other socio-demographic characteris-
tics. Age-standardisation was conducted using the United Nations
2005 population of India (both sexes combined) as the standard
[28]. Associations with socio-demographic characteristics were
examined using linear regression for mean BP adjusted for age and
socio-demographic variables, and logistic regression for the
prevalence of hypertension adjusted for age. STATA statistical
software version 10.0 was used. The analysis took account of the
cluster sampling design. Supplied weighting factors were used
throughout the analysis, including the regression analyses, to
correct for the unequal probability of selection resulting from the
sampling design. Detailed information on the survey weighting is
available at http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/surveydata/
index.php/catalog/65#page = sampling&tab = study-desc. Nu-
merators and denominators given in the text and tables refer to
the unweighted sample.
Results
Of the 12,198 survey respondents 12% (1,462) did not have
complete interviews (494 partial interviews, 968 refusals, no
contacts etc) and were excluded from further analysis. Of the
remaining 10,736, a further 65 were excluded as they had
incomplete hypertension data. Respondents with complete hyper-
tension data were more likely to live in a rural area than the 65
with incomplete hypertension data (69.4% vs. 42.8%, p = 0.03).
The mean age of those with complete hypertension data did not
differ significantly from those with incomplete data, nor did the
two groups differ in their composition by sex (p = 0.75), education
level (p = 0.33) or household wealth (p = 0.74). In general, all
further analyses were conducted on the 10,671 respondents (4,148
men, 6,523 women) with complete hypertension data. However as
three further variables - household wealth index, caste, and BMI -
contained missing data for 71, 63 and 137 respondents respec-
tively, analyses including these variables were conducted on a

slightly reduced (up to a maximum of 206) number of respondents.
Study characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 41
years, with over two-thirds living in rural areas. One-third of either
sex had a BMI below 18.5 kg/m2 while 24% of women and 21%
of men had a BMI of 23 kg/m2 or above. Two-thirds of men and
99% of women reported never consuming alcohol.
In general, findings for mean diastolic BP mirrored those of
systolic BP so only systolic BP data are shown in Table 2. Mean
systolic BP increased with age for both sexes, with a steeper and
smoother gradient in women than men. After full adjustment,
mean systolic BP increased with BMI in both sexes, and recent
users of alcohol had higher mean BP than never users. No wealth
differentials were apparent in either sex. While no urban-rural
differential was apparent in women, in men systolic BP was higher
in urban than rural residents by 4.4 mmHg which attenuated after
full adjustment to 3.2 mmHg.
The age-standardised prevalence of hypertension was 23% in
men and 26% in women increasing, in both sexes, with age from
13% under age 30 to over 40% at ages 70 and over (Table 3). In
men, hypertension was more prevalent in urban than rural areas
(age-standardised prevalence, 28% vs. 21%) with the age-adjusted
odds of men in urban areas having hypertension 1.70 (95%CI 1.21
to 2.38) times that of men in rural areas. In both sexes the odds of
having hypertension was higher in the least poor as compared with
the poorest wealth quintile, and increased steeply with BMI.
Although hypertension was more prevalent in overweight and less
poor groups, even groups with very low BMI and groups in the
poorest wealth category had appreciable levels of hypertension
(BMI,18.5: 18% men, 21% women; poorest: 20% men, 24%
women). In men, the odds of having hypertension was high in
recent (2.01 (95%CI 1.40 to 2.89)) and past (1.58 (95%CI 1.10 to
2.25)) users of alcohol compared with never users.
Table 4 shows the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment and control
of hypertension by age and sex, with the rule of halves findings
summarised in Figure 1. In both sexes, the age-standardised
prevalence of high BP at examination was around 19%, with the
rate increasing from 10% under age 30 to around one-third at ages
70 and over. The proportion of men with high BP at exam
doubled between the 18­29 and 30­39 age groups, then remained
at 20­25% through the 30 s to 60 s. Only a small proportion of
those with high BP at exam reported being diagnosed with
hypertension, with proportions particularly low at younger ages;
none of the men under 30 with high BP, and only 4% of those in
their 30 s, reported being diagnosed. The situation was slightly
better among women, but in no age group in either sex did the
proportion of those with high BP reporting diagnosis exceed one-
third; this indicates detection rates far worse than the 50%
suggested by the rule of halves. Among both men and women
reporting diagnosis with hypertension, two-thirds reported treat-
ment in the past 12 months; half the men and two-thirds of the
women treated had their BP controlled.
Urban-rural differences
One-quarter of urban men and 17% of rural men had high BP
at examination, with no urban-rural differential observed in
women (18%) (Table 5). The expected increase in prevalence of
high BP with age was not apparent for urban men; a very high
proportion, 30­40%, of those in their 30 s and 40 s had high BP,
although these figures were based on relatively small numbers. A
greater proportion of those with high BP reported diagnosis in
urban than rural areas (men: 18% urban, 11% rural; women:
27%, 16%). Among men there was no urban-rural differential in
the proportion of those with any indication of hypertension who
were diagnosed, although in both settings, at around 30%,
detection rates were low (Figure 2). The situation was better for
women. In either sex two-thirds of those diagnosed were treated,
with little evidence of an urban-rural differential. Control among
those treated was sub-optimal in urban men, only one-third of
whom had their BP controlled.
Wealth differences
In both sexes, the proportion reporting diagnosis of hyperten-
sion showed marked positive gradients from poorest to least poor
quintiles of household wealth (Table 6). The prevalence of high BP
at examination in men showed a less pronounced gradient and
among women there was no gradient with household wealth.
However, of those with high BP at exam the proportion reporting
diagnosis increased steeply with wealth (poorest: 3% men, 7%
women; least poor: 26%, 29%). When considering any indication
of hypertension, the proportion reporting diagnosis was twice as
high in the least poor as the poorest quintile (39% vs. 19% men;
56% vs. 25% women) (Table 6, Figure 3), but, excepting women in

less poor households, detection rates were low. Two-thirds of
women reporting diagnosis were treated, and around two-thirds of
those treated had adequate BP control, regardless of household
wealth. Treatment rates in men increased with household wealth,
although control among those treated appeared better in poorer
quintiles.
Discussion
These analyses indicate that over one-fifth of Indian adults had
hypertension, most of which - half in women, 70% in men - went
undetected and therefore remained untreated and uncontrolled.
Less than one-quarter of adults with measured high BP were
aware of their condition, with diagnosis rates at younger ages
particularly bad. On the other hand the data suggest that of the
hypertension that was detected, treatment rates, and control
among those treated, generally exceeded 50% which, although
sub-optimal, is comparable with the situation in more affluent
countries [15,16].
There were differentials across population groups. Although
hypertension was particularly prevalent in the least poor and the
overweight, prevalence in the poor and the underweight was also
high. These findings do not support the idea that hypertension is a
condition only of affluence [29] and therefore of low priority for
health and development programmes in India and other low- and
middle-income countries. The lack of the usual age gradient in the
prevalence of measured high BP in men is surprising. In our study
recent alcohol use was much higher in underweight than
overweight men, in rural than urban areas, and highest among
men in their 30 s and 40 s. This, and other recent exposures such
as increased dietary salt intake and low levels of physical activity in
younger people, may be contributing to our findings [30,31].
There were important differences between the sexes. The higher
overall rates of diagnosis seen in women, especially those in urban
locations and in better off households, probably result from
contact with health services around childbearing. National Family
Health Survey data for 2005­06 indicate that 77% of women
attended an antenatal clinic for their most recent birth, and 64%
of attendees had their BP measured [32]; attendance was much
less common in rural than urban areas, and in poorer households,
as was the proportion of attendees who had their BP measured.
Our data show for women, but not men, a lack of patterning of
treatment and control of hypertension across urban-rural or
household wealth categories suggesting that the quality of care is
more of an issue for men than women. The failure to detect
hypertension in younger men, and the poor control in urban men,
is of particular importance, suggesting a need for more proactive
surveillance.
These analyses, based on recent nationally-representative survey
data, provide up to date national estimates of the prevalence,
diagnosis, treatment and control of hypertension amongst adults in
India. This is important new information as, to date, most
evidence on hypertension, and chronic disease more generally, in
India has come from small scale and/or local studies.
The SAGE survey has the strength of containing blood pressure
measurements and self-reported information on diagnosis and
treatment of hypertension thus providing the opportunity to
compare and contrast clinical measurements with self-reported
data. The accuracy and reliability of Boso BP instruments, widely
used in Germany, has been recognised by the German consumer
safety organisation with the Medistar S coming top in the wrist
category and the German Hypertension Society also confirms
their high accuracy [33]. Self-reported information may be
affected by recall biases and reporting errors which may vary by
socio-demographic characteristics. As the survey question on
treatment did not differentiate taking medication, weight loss
program or change in eating habits, it was not possible to identify
the subgroup taking hypertension medication, as recommended by
the JNC guidelines as a diagnostic criteria for hypertension [25].
The adequacy of assessing prevalence of high BP using measure-
ments made at a single clinic visit has been questioned [34] as it
does not mirror clinical guidance of making repeated measure-
ments over several weeks in order to avoid regression to the mean
effects. These effects lead to over-estimation of the prevalence of
high BP as the within-person fluctuations in blood pressure will
tend to underestimate the ``usual'' level of blood pressure [35].
However, measurements made on a single occasion do have strong
predictive power for cardiovascular disease in epidemiological
studies [36,37].

Inequalities in Hypertension in India
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86043
This nationally-representative study shows high rates of
hypertension in adults in India affecting both the poor and the
better off and with sub-optimal detection particularly among
young urban men and poorer households. Tackling low detection
rates is the priority as, once detected, the results indicate that rates
of treatment and control of hypertension are relatively good.
Substantial effort ­ both in improving clinical practice and in
preventing high BP in the first place - is needed to reduce the high
rates of hypertension, and the resulting large burden of
cardiovascular disease, in India.
