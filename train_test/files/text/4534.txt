Abstract: Previous studies suggest that human facial attractiveness is culturally universal.
As they were conducted among Western populations and populations strongly influenced
by the Western culture, it is not obvious if the preferences would also be the same in
populations isolated from this culture. It is also not certain if the agreement would be the
same in the case of attractive and unattractive faces. In the presented study participated 103
people from the Yali tribe (Papua, Indonesia) and 99 Poles. Their task was to choose the
most attractive and unattractive face of the opposite sex from a set of 4 pictures (one
attractive, one unattractive and two average faces of Polish people chosen in a pre-test).
We showed significant cross-cultural differences in attractiveness preferences and
similarities in choices of unattractive faces. We speculate that across cultures
unattractiveness could be assessed on the basis of the same cues to health and biological
quality. Attractiveness criteria seem to be more complex, specific to each population, and
dependent on the population's ecological conditions and morphological characteristics.

Introduction
Perception of physical attractiveness is regarded as an evolutionary adaptation to
enhance own reproductive success through mating with an appropriate partner (Buss, 1999;
Symons, 1995). The most important component of physical attractiveness in humans is
facial appearance (Currie and Little, 2009; Peters et al., 2007). Research conducted in
industrial societies (mainly on people of European origin) showed that many features of the
face, including geometric typicality, sex-typical characteristics, symmetry, skin condition,
and fat amount, are cue to the individual's biological quality and influence its attractiveness

(Coetzee et al., 2009; Fink, Grammer, and Thornhill, 2001; Fink and Penton-Voak, 2002;
Fink et al., 2012; Gallup and Frederick, 2010; Kociski, 2007, 2008; Little, Jones, and
DeBruine, 2011a; Perrett, 2012; Perrett at al., 1998, 1999; Rhodes, 2006). Theoretical and
empirical research suggests that the relationship of facial characteristics with biological
quality is not limited to a group of human populations and not even to humans (Andersson,
1994; Symons, 1995; Thornhill and Gangestad, 1993; Tybur and Gangestad, 2011). On
these grounds, one may suspect that attractiveness criteria and evaluations of facial appeal
would be universal across cultures (see Langlois et al., 2000).
On the other hand, several mechanisms can produce systematic inter-population
differences in perception of facial attractiveness. First, if two human groups differ in facial
proportions to some degree they will materialize the preference for typical facial
proportions in a different way from each other (Symons, 1979; Jones, 1996). Second,
preferences for some facial features may be adaptively related to ecological conditions,
e.g., female preference for masculine male faces is stronger in populations of poor health
and high threat of pathogens (DeBruine et al., 2010, 2012). Third, preferences of random
origin can spread over a local population through social learning (Little et al., 2011b).
Many studies reported high inter-racial and inter-cultural agreement in perception of
facial attractiveness (Langlois et al., 2000). However, most of the studies were conducted
among populations highly exposed to Western culture. Such groups could have assimilated
the European standards of facial attractiveness through social learning (Little et al., 2011b)
or thanks to visual experience with faces of White people (Little et al., 2011a). Indeed, the
level of agreement with the standards in Black people (Martin, 1964), Koreans (Lim and
Giddon, 1991) and Mexicans (Mejia-Maidl et al., 2005) depends on the degree of exposure
to the Western culture. Black people (Martin, 1964), Asians (Maganzini et al., 2000; Choe
et al., 2004; Soh et al., 2005), and Amerindians (Husein et al., 2010) prefer faces of own
races that possess proportions typical for White individuals. Brazilians from cities inhabited
mainly by dark-skinned people prefer facial proportions characteristic for Europeans rather
than natives (Jones and Hill, 1993). Non-White women endeavor to make appearance of
their faces similar to faces of White women (Dobke et al., 2006; Sturm-O'Brien et al.,
2010). And in the opposite direction, the longer a White man stays in a non-Western
society, the stronger is attracted to physical features being typical for local people (Symons,
1995, p. 107).
In light of above, studying facial preferences in populations isolated from Western
culture is highly desired, though data are scarce. Jones and Hill (1993) found that
assessments of facial attractiveness made by Aché (Paraguay) and Hiwi (Venezuela)
Indians are poorly associated with those by Americans, Russians, and Brazilians (average r
= .13). Zebrowitz et al. (2012) observed a moderate agreement between Tsimané Indians
(Bolivia) and Americans (average r = .40). Somewhat higher agreement was found in
studies on less isolated populations: the correlation between assessments by Black people
in Lagos (Nigeria) and Black and White individuals in USA averaged .54 (Martin, 1964),
and correlation between assessments by peasants from south-western Senegal and
American people was .60 (Silva et al., 2012).
Studies that concentrated on specific facial features showed that men from rural
Borneo preferred feminine female faces (Scott et al., 2008), and Hadza, Tanzanian hunter-
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?

gatherers, preferred faces which were symmetric (Little et al., 2007) and possessed
proportions typical for this population (Apicella et al., 2007). Additionally, women's
preference for male-typical facial characteristics was affected by relationship context in
Malaysians from Borneo (Scott et al., 2008) and in Matsigenka people from Peru (Yu et al.,
2007). However, these studies do not examine the extent of inter-population agreement in
perception of facial attractiveness.
More anecdotal evidence suggest that facial preferences may be universal to some
degree: e.g., Ford and Beach reviewed ethnographic data and concluded that "a poor
complexion is one feature that is considered sexually repulsive in a large number of
societies" (Ford and Beach, 1951, p. 89), and Darwin cited opinions of some travelers that
people worldwide agree with White people on who is attractive and who is not (Darwin,
1874, p. 582). But, the need for further, systematic research on this topic is clear-cut.
Surprisingly, existing literature has examined only cross-cultural differences in
assessments of attractiveness. Meanwhile, the topic of unattractiveness has been neglected.
To our knowledge, only Boski (2009) suggested that inter-population similarity in
perception of unattractiveness or ugliness might be higher than similarity in perception of
attractiveness or beauty in human faces. He did not conduct systematic research on that
topic, but he observed that his Polish, Canadian and Nigerian students agreed more on
unattractiveness of faces (Nigerian generals and politicians) than on their attractiveness.
At least two mechanisms can potentially explain higher agreement in the case of
unattractiveness: one related to a preference for faces of a typical appearance and one
related to a greater importance of low than high attractiveness.
First, people seem to prefer faces of appearance typical for their population. On the
basis of previously seen faces they develop a mental prototype of a face which normally
reflects a typical, or average, face (Tsao and Livingstone, 2008) and this prototype is then
used to assess normality and attractiveness of subsequently seen faces. The preference for
geometrically average faces is well documented (Kociski, 2007; Little, 2011a; Rhodes,
2006) and in multiracial societies a face's attractiveness is evaluated with regard to its
proximity to the average face of its own race (Potter et al., 2007; Potter and Corneille,
2008). Because different facial forms are typical for different human groups, the neural
prototype will vary among the group as well. Therefore, leaving other attractiveness
determinants aside, a face of a person from population A, which is similar to the average
face for this population, would be regarded attractive by members of the population but
relatively unattractive by members of population B, if the latter is characterized by other
facial proportions than population A. However, a face of a person from population A, which
strongly departs from the average face for this population would probably substantially
differ from the average face for population B as well. Then, again leaving other
attractiveness determinants aside, an unattractive face for population A would usually be
also unattractive for population B. A face from population A could be attractive for people
from population B only in a rare case when it resembles faces typical for population B (i.e.,
it departs, in its shape, from the average face for population A just towards the average face
for population B); in this case, however, the face will not be attractive for members of
population A. These considerations lead to the prediction that people from populations that
differ from each other in facial geometry should agree more on which faces are unattractive
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?

than which are attractive.
The second mechanism is related to greater importance of low than high
attractiveness. Facial attractiveness is associated with health and intelligence only within
the lower range of its variation (Zebrowitz and Rhodes, 2004) and therefore a better mating
tactic is to avoid only lowly attractive candidates (not those moderately attractive) than to
accept only highly attractive ones (Zebrowitz et al., 2003; Zebrowitz and Rhodes, 2004;
Zebrowitz, 2004). Negative stimuli, in general, impact on humans more strongly than
positive (Baumeister et al., 2001) and physical attractiveness fall under this rule: low
attractiveness elicits stronger arousal in observers (Mehrabian and Blum, 1997) and raises
stronger attributions on scales of altruism and intelligence (Griffin and Langlois, 2006)
than high attractiveness. Analyses of evaluations of facial attractiveness suggest that
observers rather avoid lowly attractive mates than pursue those of high attractiveness (Park
et al., 2012) and attach more weight to the least attractive rather than most attractive feature
of the face being assessed (Grammer et al., 2002). Whether attractiveness of a partner is
low or moderate is more important for people than whether it is high or moderate (Li et al.,
2002). Reproductive (Jokela, 2009) and professional (Hamermesh and Biddle, 1994)
success is decreased by an individual's low attractiveness to a greater degree than they are
increased by high attractiveness, at least in men. Abovementioned findings suggest that
reliable cues to biological quality and mate value, such as skin condition, symmetry, and
deformation, are more important for perception of low than high attractiveness.
Recognition of faces as highly attractive may, in turn, depend to a greater degree on use of
criteria specific for the population (e.g., ecological conditions, DeBruine et al., 2010) or the
individual (e.g., own and parental appearance, Watkins et al., 2011). We then predict that
inter-population similarity is higher in identifying lowly than highly attractive faces. It can
be also predicted that intra-population agreement of judges is higher for the former task as
well, but in this case the effect can arise only from factors specific for individuals, not for
populations.
In the present study, women and men from Poland and a Papuan tribe were asked to
choose the most attractive and unattractive face from a group of opposite-sex European
faces. The study aimed to test the following predictions: (1) There is some similarity
between Poles and Papuans in perception of facial attractiveness. (2) The similarity is
higher for choosing the least than the most attractive face. (3) Intra-population agreement is
higher for choosing the least than the most attractive face. (4) Intra-population agreement is
higher among Polish than Papuan participants because of greater visual experience with
faces of White individuals in the former group.
Materials and Methods
Stimuli
In the first phase of the study, we took 50 female and 50 male facial pictures of
randomly selected people aged 19-24 from the university campuses (dormitories) in
Wroclaw (Poland). Only 2 approached people did not agree for their picture being taken.
Participants were familiarized with the aim of the research and they gave their informed,
written consent for using their pictures in the subsequent part of the research. All the

pictures had plain, gray background. Participants were asked to maintain neutral facial
expression. In the pictures, the participants' hair was not altered, first, to maintain a natural
appearance, and second, because hair is also an important element of facial attractiveness
(Meskó and Bereczkei, 2004). In any case, hair color and style was lowly diversified
among faces of a given sex, particularly in men. The presented faces did not have any
deformations or signs of serious diseases.
All 100 pictures were assessed by 10 other students (5 females, 5 males) on a 1 to 7
scale (from 1 ­ very unattractive to 7 ­ very attractive). For the purpose of further study,
we ranked the faces according to the average obtained attractiveness (female and male
faces separately) and selected 4 faces of each sex: the most attractive face (further, A face),
the least attractive face (further, D face), and two moderately attractive faces (rank 25 and
26, further, B and C faces). Mean ratings and their standard deviations for the selected faces
were as follows: female faces, A face, M = 6.4, SD = 0.55; B face, M = 3.7, SD = 0.7; C
face, M = 3.8, SD = 1.1; D face, M = 2.0, SD = 0.7; male faces, A face, M = 6.0, SD = 0.9;
B face, M = 3.6, SD = 1.2; C face, M = 3.7, SD = 1.5; D face, M = 2.1, SD = 0.8.
Participants
The research was conducted among the Yali tribe (Papua, Indonesian province
previously known as Irian Jaya). The Yali inhabit mountainous areas east of the Baliem
valley (3.92 S, 138.73 E from Wamena ­ central part of Baliem valley). The Yali are one of
many indigenous ethnic groups in Papua. Even though Christianity is present in this region,
the Yali have preserved their traditional lifestyle. They are polygamic (21% of males who
participated in our study had more than one wife), men live together in a separate
household and wear traditional clothing (some wear only a koteka, which is a traditional
wooden penis sheath). The Yali cultivate plots, hunt as well as breed pigs (which constitute
a marker of a man's wealth and social position).
Yali tribe can be described as a population with a minor contact with Western
culture; due to the remote location of their dwellings and difficult access very few tourists
have visited their region (the only access routes to the Yali territory are via private or
chartered aircraft or a several days long trek through the mountains). All the study sites
were located along a mountainous route (from South-East to North­West) surrounding the
Baliem Valley from the East. As was indicated by the participants themselves, the villages
were visited by trekking groups from 10-15 trek groups yearly in Pilliam to approximately
1-3 times during the last five years in small mountain villages (according to the estimates
of the participants, on average they saw 9 tourist groups, SD = 4.8 during the period of 5
years before the day of the study).
All the inhabitants of the visited villages (except for children and the elderly) were
invited to take part in the study. The number of positive responses to the invitation was
approximately 40­50%. In the end, 103 participants were recruited to participate in the
study ­ 53 females and 50 males. The female participants were aged between 25 and 59
years (M = 38.3, SD = 8.7) and male participants between 19 and 50 years (M = 35.9, SD =
7.6). The age was self-estimated ­ majority of the participants did not know their exact age
and relied on rough estimates. The participants were interviewed by a Papuan assistant
(from the Dani tribe) fluent in English and the local Yali dialect. All participants were
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?

reimbursed for their participation by receiving the equivalent of 3USD.
The same research was conducted in Poland among 50 men and 49 women. The
female participants were aged between 19 and 50 years (M = 34.5, SD = 8.8) and male
participants between 19 and 53 years (M = 36.3, SD = 9.0). All raters were ethnic Poles,
and were a diverse group recruited on bus and train terminals in Wroclaw (Poland). The
study was conducted by one of the authors (P.S.). Poland is a country in Central Europe
with a GDP of about 20,000 US$ per capita and is part of the European Union. It is
representative of a modern industrialized society.
Procedure
Prior to the main experiment, each Yali participant was interviewed in order to
make sure that the experimental question and certain concepts were clear and easily
understood. Each interview lasted relatively long, as participants were asked a series of
questions related to their concept of attractiveness (e.g., Sorokowski and Sorokowska,
2012); that is why we are fairly sure that each participant understood the task correctly.
Each participant was presented with 4 randomly arranged laminated images of
opposite-sex faces, each sized 9x15 cm, and asked to choose the most attractive and,
separately, the unattractive face in their opinion. The participants were surveyed
individually. The procedure was easy and transparent to all participants ­ e.g., none of them
indicated the same face as the most attractive and the most unattractive one. We repeated
the same procedure, with the same set of stimuli in the Polish group.
Analysis of choices
To verify the formulated hypotheses, we required a measure of agreement among
judges from a given group and a measure of similarity between two groups of judges.
Because the variables of interest, i.e. the face that was chosen as the most attractive or
unattractive, were categorical, popular measures of variation and association, like variance
or coefficient of correlation, were not applicable here.
To assess the agreement level among judges from a group we used the Index of
Qualitative Variation (IQV), which equals 1 minus the sum of squared percentages across
categories, 
- 2
1 i
p (Swanson, 1976; Kader and Perry, 2007). Because IQV values are
negatively related to the judges' agreement, we introduced an Intra-group Agreement Index
(IAI) equaling 1 ­ IQV, or simply  2
i
p .
To assess similarity level between two groups of judges we applied the Morisita
Similarity Index (MSI). It is calculated as

of the most complex indices of this sort, it is recommended in literature for its statistical
properties (Wolda, 1981).

To check whether agreement level among Polish judges was the same as for Papuan
(for faces of given sex and the judged characteristic), resampling was conducted at each
repeat from the Polish and Papuan sample defined by numbers of choices of each face
(from A to D). The value of IAI was determined for each of the two resamples and the
difference between the IAI values, IAI, was further analyzed. According to the null
hypothesis, i.e., assuming the same agreement in each population, the expected value of
IAI is 0. To determine p-value for this hypothesis, the number of cases where IAI
crossed 0 was divided by repeat count (10.000) and the resultant percentage multiplied by 2
so to obtain a two-tailed p-value. The analysis was conducted four times, separately for
choices of the most attractive female or male face and choices of unattractive female or
male face.
Equality of agreement levels between choices of the most attractive and unattractive
face (for given facial sex and judges origin) was examined in a similar way. In this case,
however, the compared variables were dependent (e.g. a judge could not choose the same
face as the most attractive and unattractive). Hence, resampling was conducted on the
contingency table for these variables (the most attractive × the unattractive face) rather than
univariate distributions. The analysis was carried out four times, separately for choices of
female face by Poles or Papuans and choices of male face by Poles or Papuans.
A hypothesis that no difference exists between choices made by Poles and Papuans
(i.e. that they wholly agree with each other) was checked with the chi-squared test of
independence, separately for each facial sex and judged characteristic. In case of rejecting
of the hypothesis, we checked whether a statistically significant similarity between Poles
and Papuans exists at all. To this end, we first determined the value of MSI characteristic
for no agreement between groups (MSI0
). Specifically, we established the MSI value for the
actual distribution of choices made by Poles and a hypothetical, discrete uniform
distribution of choices by Papuans, which depicts random choices. Next, we run a bootstrap
analysis for actual choices by Poles and Papuans, separately for each facial sex and judged
characteristic. The MSI value was calculated at each repeat, the number of cases where MSI
exceeded MSI0
was divided by repeat count (10.000), and the resultant percentage
multiplied by 2 so to obtain a two-tailed p-value. In addition, we calculated percentage
inter-population similarities, %MSI, taking MSI0
Then, we checked whether the similarity level between Poles and Papuans was the
same for choices of the most attractive and unattractive face, separately for female and
male faces. The bootstrapping method was used again. Because choices of the most
attractive and unattractive face were dependent, resampling was conducted on contingency
tables for these variables, one table per judges' population. At each repeat the MSI value
for choices of the most attractive and unattractive face was calculated and the difference
between both values, MSI, was then analyzed. According to the null hypothesis, i.e.
assuming that inter-group similarity did not depend on which characteristic was assessed,
the expected value of MSI is 0. To determine p-value for this hypothesis, the number of
cases where MSI crossed 0 was divided by repeat count (10.000) yielding a one-tailed p-
value. The use of the one-tailed test was warranted here because several lines of reasoning
suggest inter-population similarity to be higher for perception of unattractiveness than
as 0% and the theoretically maximum
value of MSI, i.e. 1, as 100%.

attractiveness (see Introduction).
The above hypothesis was also tested on data for both sexes combined. To this end,
the bootstrap analysis was conducted simultaneously on data for female and male faces and
at each repeat the average MSI value was calculated from values obtained for both sexes,
separately for choices of the most attractive and unattractive faces: MSIATTR
= (MSIATTR-
FEMALE
+ MSIATTR-MALE
) / 2, and MSIUNATTR
= (MSIUNATTR-FEMALE
+ MSIUNATTR-MALE
) / 2.

Because tests for equality of inter-population similarity in choices of the most
attractive and unattractive face are crucial for the present study, the respective bootstrap
analyses for female faces, male faces, and both sexes combined, was conducted 10 times
each so to gen up on reliability of the obtained p-values.
,
obtained in 10.000 repeats.
Finally, we used the Fisher's exact test to compare frequencies of choice of a given
face by Poles versus Papuans, separately in attractiveness and unattractiveness conditions.
The 2 × 2 contingency tables were filled with frequencies for the face and for the other
faces pooled, as chosen by each group of judges.
Analysis of facial shape
We also ascertained whether geometrical proximity of the faces to a typical face of
Poles or Yali influenced their attractiveness according to Polish and Papuan participants,
respectively. To this end, we measured 15 distances on digital images of faces in frontal
aspect using author-developed software (in Microsoft Visual Basic 6). Apart from the 8
faces used in the present study (the test faces), measurements were conducted on 192
female and 158 male faces of Poles, and on 12 female and 9 male faces of Yali (the
reference faces; they were taken from the authors' photograph collections). The measured
distances included the eye, nose, and mouth widths and heights, forehead height, eyebrow
thickness, eyebrow-to-eye distance, interpupillary distance, facial width at levels of
cheekbones and lips, chin height, nose-to-mouth distance, and horizontal distance from lip
corners to the face's contour. Points defining the distances were located in agreement with
anthropometric standards (Farkas, 1994). The measured distances were then corrected for
the face's overall size, which was determined as the average distance of the points from
their centroid.
Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistica StatSoft 8.0. Examination of 4
facial groups, female/male × Polish/Papuan reference faces, showed that the Mahalanobis
distances between sexes were much smaller (on average, 2.81 times) than those between
populations. Therefore, further analysis was conducted on faces of both sexes combined. A
discriminant analysis was first run on two groups of reference faces (Polish and Papuan)
and then the Mahalanobis distances of each of the 8 test faces from the typical Polish face
and typical Yali face were established. The distances were then correlated with frequencies
of choices of each face as the most attractive or unattractive by Polish and Papuan
participants (the Pearson correlation coefficient was applied). We hypothesized that a
face's distance to the typical Polish or Yali face would be negatively related to the
frequency of being chosen as the most attractive and positively related to the frequency of
being chosen as unattractive by Polish and Yali participants, respectively. Because of very

small sample size (8 test faces) and non-independence of frequencies (they sum up to 1 for
each sex) we did not perform a statistical test for the obtained correlations but only
examined whether their direction was as expected.

Figure 1. Distributions of choices for the most attractive and unattractive female and male
face by Poles and Papuans
Notes: Asterisks indicate significant differences in frequency of a face's choice between Poles and
Papuans (* ­ p < 0.05, ** ­ p < 0.01, *** ­ p < 0.001, **** ­ p < 0.0001)
The chi-squared test of independence uncovered significant differences between
choices made by Poles and Papuans, irrespective of facial sex and judged characteristic: the
most attractive female, 2 (3) = 16.93, p < .001; the unattractive female, 2 (3) = 11.24, p =
.010; the most attractive male, 2 (3) = 32.01, p < .001; the unattractive male, 2
We then checked whether a statistically significant similarity between Poles and
Papuans exists at all. The hypothesis on lack of such similarity was rejected for choices of
the most attractive female (MSI = 0.76, MSI

male (MSI = 0.80, MSI0

similarity for choices of the most attractive male face also manifested in that Poles most
frequently chose the face A while Papuans the face B (Figure 1).
Although inter-population similarity in choices of the unattractive female face was
higher than for the most attractive one (MSIUNATTR
= 0.89, MSIATTR
= 0.76), the difference
was not statistically significant; the minimum, average, and maximum one-tailed p-value,
as obtained from 10 courses of the bootstrap analysis, was 0.166, 0.172, and 0.177,
respectively. The difference was however significant for male faces (MSIUNATTR
= 0.80,
MSIATTR
= 0.52, pMIN
= .030, pAVERAGE
= .033, pMAX
= .037), and for data for both sexes
combined (MSIUNATTR
= 0.84, MSIATTR
= 0.64, pMIN
= .020, pAVERAGE
= .023, pMAX
Yali faces proved quite different in shape from Polish ones: the t-test revealed a
significant difference for 14 out of 15 facial distances being measured. First of all, Yali
faces were distinguished by lowly placed eyebrows, wide nose, wide mouth, short chin,
narrow jaw, and lip corners close to facial contour (Cohen's d > 2 for each of these
features). The discriminant analysis correctly classified each reference face with a
probability of 0.99998 or higher and each test face with a probability of 0.9999998 or
higher. The Mahalanobis distances of the test faces from the typical Polish face and typical
Yali face are given in Table 2. The distance to the Polish typical face correlated with
frequency of being chosen as the most attractive by Polish participants at 0.51 and with
frequency of being chosen as unattractive at ­0.37. Equivalent correlations for distances
from the typical Yali face and Yali participants were 0.55 and ­0.58. All these correlations
were in the direction opposite to the predicted.

Finally, we checked whether the geometric proximity to the typical Polish rather
than Yali face is related to being more frequently chosen as the most attractive by Poles
than Papuans and being less frequently chosen as unattractive by Poles than Papuans. The
difference between Mahalanobis distance to the Yali and Polish typical faces correlated
with the difference between frequency of being chosen as the most attractive by Poles vs
Papuans at ­0.51; again, this was opposite to the predicted direction. However, the former
difference correlated with the difference between frequencies of being chosen as the
unattractive by Poles vs Papuans at ­0.19, which was in the predicted direction.
Discussion
As we discussed in the Introduction, few studies examined facial preferences in
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?

populations isolated from the Western culture and none compared perception of facial
unattractiveness across cultures. In the presented study we found that Yali from Papua
perceived attractiveness in a somewhat similar way as people from central Europe and the
similarity was higher when they chose the least than when they chose the most attractive
face. Below we discuss the results in detail.
Intra-group agreement in perception of attractiveness
Judges from Poland were more consistent than Papuans in the choice of the most
attractive and unattractive face. This could have resulted from using only European faces,
more familiar to Poles than Papuans in the study. Rich visual experience that Poles had in
their lives with faces of White individuals surely enhanced their efficiency in neural
processing of such faces. Visual experience with faces is required for development of their
efficient processing (Le Grand et al., 2001) and the efficiency is highest for faces of the
race that was seen most frequently (Sangrigoli et al., 2005; Pascalis et al., 2011). Poles'
facial processing can be superior also because they saw much more faces altogether than
Papuans (Pascalis et al., 2011; Zebrowitz et al., 2012). Furthermore, Polish participants
might learn Western attractiveness standards for European faces from mass media and
through other means of social learning (Little et al., 2011b). Low experience of Yali people
with faces of White people and ignorance of the attractiveness canons can explain their low
consistence in the present study.
The level of intra-group agreement in choice of the most attractive face did not
differ significantly from agreement in choice of the unattractive one, irrespective of sex of
a face and the judges' group. No support was therefore obtained for the prediction that
people are more consistent in perception of low than high attractiveness. However, the
reason for the null result could be that numeric attractiveness of D faces (selected as lowly
attractive) was relatively close to the attractiveness of B and C faces (selected as
moderately attractive), whereas A faces obtained much higher evaluations (see Materials
and Methods). This could make the choice of the unattractive face relatively difficult, and
in consequence lower the intra-group consistence in this choice to the level characteristic
for choice of the most attractive face. Nevertheless, the observed independence of the
judges' agreement level from the evaluated characteristic will be important for interpreting
of inter-population similarities in perception of attractiveness (see below).
Inter-group similarity in perception of attractiveness
In the present study we found some similarity in perception of facial attractiveness
between Europeans (Poles) and the Yali people isolated in mountains of Papua. This agrees
with results of previous studies conducted in societies that were highly (Jones and Hill,
1993; Zebrowitz et al., 2012) or partly (Martin, 1964; Silva et al., 2012) isolated from
Western culture. The similarity was high for choice of the unattractive female face and
moderate for choice of the most attractive female face and the unattractive male face; no
similarity was however observed for choice of the most attractive man. The similarity
between Poles and Papuans was greater for choice of the least than the most attractive face;
we were not however able to settle unambiguously whether the effect applied to faces of
both sexes or only to females.
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -919-
Because intra-group agreement in choice of the unattractive face was not higher
than for the most attractive face (see above), the reason of the greater inter-group similarity
in choice of the unattractive than the most attractive face could not be an ease of identifying
the face of the worst look. To determine probable reasons of the observed effect, 4 people,
including authors, examined faces involved in the present study for geometric averageness,
masculinity/femininity, symmetry, skin condition, fattiness, facial expression and makeup.
Then, drawing on these observations, the quantitative analysis of the faces' shape and
scientific knowledge about determinants of facial attractiveness, we endeavored to identify
features responsible for the judges' choices.
One observation proved clear-cut: the faces that were regarded the unattractive (D
faces) possessed the worst skin condition from faces of their sex, the skin had blemishes,
erythema, and, in the man, some swellings. The faces were not characterized by any
conspicuous asymmetry or disproportion and the female face had the most pleasant
expression, and yet, they were categorized as unattractive by judges from both populations.
Although the male face had the nose of above-average size, this cannot be the reason for its
low attractiveness for Yali observers since Yali themselves possess huge noses. The
facialmetric analysis confirmed that the shape of D faces was not atypical when compared
either to the average Polish or Yali face (Table 2). It appears, therefore, that cues to poor
health present on skin has a decisive and negative influence on perceived attractiveness,
irrespective of the observer's place of origin (compare Ford and Beach, 1951, p. 89).
Criteria for choosing the most attractive faces are less clear. The A faces had nice
skin but it was not unquestionably healthiest from all faces of their sex. According to
Papuans, the most attractive male face was the B face, which had worse skin than faces A
and C (a number of blemishes). It is not clear why Papuans did not prefer the C face, which
was quite similar to the B face with respect to geometry and hair but had a clean skin. The
facialmetric analysis did not show that similarity to the typical Papuan face increased the
perceived attractiveness. What is more, the male face that was regarded the most attractive
by Papuans (the B face) was the least similar in its shape to the typical Yali face (Table 2).
The male A face was clearly masculine: possessed a strong chin, prominent nose,
and thick eyebrows. Because female preference for male-typical facial features is stronger
in populations of poor health and high threat of pathogens (DeBruine et al., 2010, 2012),
and the populations of New Guinea are examples of them (World Health Organization,
2012), one might expect Yali women to prefer the A face, which however was not the case.
Unlike the male B face, the A face was slightly asymmetric (slanting lips) and its
appearance suggested a lower body fattiness as compared with the B face (see Coetzee et
al., 2009). These properties might have contributed to the preference of the B face over A
face by Papuans because symmetry (Little et al., 2007) and body fat (Brown and Konner,
1987) are preferred more strongly in traditional than industrial populations.
The aforementioned characteristics do not explain why the most attractive female
face was the A face and why this was particularly true for Polish judges. In comparison to
B-D faces, it was not characterized by high geometric similarity to the typical Polish face or
low similarity to the typical Yali face (Table 2). The reason of its appeal could be that it
was decisively the most feminine female face. Because hard living conditions make men
prefer relatively more masculine faces in women (Pettijohn and Jungeberg, 2004; Pettijohn
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -920-
and Tesser, 1999), the Papuan males might not be attracted to a conspicuous femininity.
Limitations
One of the limitations of our research is the fact that it was conducted only with the
use of pictures of Polish participants, because, unfortunately, not enough Papuan
respondents agreed for their photographs being taken in order to conduct a replication of
this research in Europe. Another limitation of this study was also a simple methodology
(choice of the most attractive and the most unattractive picture); however, during the
experiment we observed that the Yali were not able to assess attractiveness of provided
faces on a numeric scale (as it is commonly done in studies involving Western
populations). They are illiterate and not used to participation in scientific studies. This
simple methodology enabled us to collect more reliable data ­ it is possible that some
Papuan participants would perform their task randomly if the procedure was too difficult.
Additionally, such methodology enabled us to polarize the assessments and examine the
perception of attractiveness and unattractiveness.
Another limitation is a low number of photographs used in the study. A different set
of faces might generate different levels of agreement. But, low number of faces made the
task much easier and more comprehensible for Yali people ­ too many faces could be too
confounding for them and might discourage them from participation in the study. Also, low
number of photographs makes it harder to determine the influence of particular facial
features on general attractiveness. However, the primary aim of the study was to compare
the general assessments of attractiveness and unattractiveness in Polish and Papuan people.
Further studies could also test perception of facial attractiveness regardless of sex of
target/judge. Such a methodology would help to examine perceptions of attractiveness
outside of mating contexts.
Finally, we compared results only from two cultures. This might not be enough to
draw a conclusion that perception of facial unattractiveness is culturally universal.
Conclusions
Intra-group agreement in choice of the most attractive and unattractive female and
male face was higher for Europeans (Poles) than indigenous Papuans (Yali tribe), which
probably resulted from the scant visual experience of Papuans with European faces and
ignorance of Western standards of beauty. Despite these, Yali perceived attractiveness
somewhat similarly to the Polish judges and the similarity was higher for choice of the least
than the most attractive face. The latter finding cannot be attributed to a greater ease in
choosing the lowly than highly attractive face because intra-group agreement in choice of
the unattractive face was not higher than for the most attractive one.
It seems that skin condition indicative of a poor health is a cross-cultural criterion of
low attractiveness. It is understandable in light of the universal character of skin cues to
health and disease (Fitzpatrick, Wolff, Johnson, and Suurmon, 2005) and importance of the
partner's health for reproductive success of the choosing person (Buss, 1999). This claim
conforms with Ford and Beach's analysis of ethnographic data that "a poor complexion is
one feature that is considered sexually repulsive in a large number of societies" (Ford and
Beach, 1951, p. 89) and Symons' conjecture that "tendencies to pay close attention to skin
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -921-
condition and to be attracted by a clear, clean complexion probably are innate human
dispositions" (Symons, 1979, p.187). Poor health status reflected in skin condition may
have a genetic origin (see the bad genes hypothesis, Zebrowitz and Rhodes, 2004) or result
from non-genetic factors, like infections or diet (Tybur and Gangestad, 2011). On the other
hand, criteria for recognizing highly attractive faces seem to be more complex, specific to
each population, and dependent on the population's ecological conditions and
morphological characteristics (even though we found no empirical support for the latter
factor). Skin look may weigh less here than for perception of low attractiveness, which was
evident for Papuan judges who strongly preferred a bad-skinned male face.
Further studies on perception of facial attractiveness in societies isolated from
Western culture are needed. The perception of unattractiveness also deserves greater
scientific interest than has been shown thus far. We predict that the higher inter-group
similarity in perception of low than high attractiveness can be replicated in studies on other
populations, both those culturally isolated from and those closer to the West, as well as on
different groups (e.g., age groups within one population). The effect may be even stronger
if people are to assess a group of very attractive and very unattractive faces (e.g., those of
beauty contest winners and seriously ill individuals).
