Introduction
"We are trying to be better at documenting the silent
knowledge . . . "
--Care worker at Bayside Park1
Organized elder care in Sweden has in recent years come
under scrutiny with a focus on staff knowledge or lack of
knowledge. On a national level, improved quality of care has
been presented as mainly depending on the improvement of
staff competence (by increased knowledge;Ahnlund, 2008a),
shifting the responsibility of quality in elder care to staff
working closely with older people, the care workers. The
specific nature of this improved knowledge is, however,
debated and not clearly identified, and a gap exists between
what policies state and what ground-level staff believe is
desirable (Ahnlund, 2008b), exemplifying the gap between
theory and practice.
To explore and illuminate aspects of knowledge in the
daily life of staff in elder care units, participant observations
were initiated by the first author at two elder care units in a
mid-size city in Sweden. The two units are referred to as
Bayside Park and Stonewood Manor, both fictitious names.
The discussion on improving knowledge for staff in elder
care and its implications for practical elder care was mani-
fested during the participant observations at the two elder
care units. The care workers at the two units shared their
thoughts and views about knowledge in their work in
general, in addition to the situations the first author observed.
Shortly after beginning the participant observations at
Bayside Park, a care worker referred to (the much discussed)
silent knowledge, as illustrated in the quote above.
This text thus focuses on knowledge and more specifi-
cally on the perception of silent knowledge, elaborated on as
a tacit knowledge. Examples from the field notes are used to
explore how care workers use and express this tacit knowl-
edge in their everyday practices. The aim of this article is to
examine how tacit knowledge can be understood and what
specifies this knowledge for staff in a setting of elder care:
How can tacit knowledge be identified and described?
The following section of this article briefly introduces
Swedish elder care relating to the concept of knowledge used
and developed by care workers, providing the study back-
ground. The third section addresses method and analysis,
describing the current project: an ethnographic study in two
elder care units in Sweden. This analysis leads to the ethical
considerations that are addressed in the fourth section.
Theoretical links are made in the fifth section, and the
sixth section includes findings derived from the empirical

"You Have to Have a Certain Feeling for
This Work": Exploring Tacit Knowledge
in Elder Care
Ulrika Börjesson1, Staffan Bengtsson1, and Elisabet Cedersund2
Abstract
Increased care worker knowledge has been emphasized for improving quality of care for older persons in organized elder
care in Sweden. However, care workers and national policies are not always corresponding, with observations suggesting
that care workers emphasize tacit knowledge. The aim of this article is to explore the nature of this kind of knowledge and
how it can be identified and described. Field notes from participant observations at two elder care units in Sweden serve as
the empirical material. Knowledge use for staff in elder care is part of a process of knowledge making and knowledge shaping.
Analysis of the field notes identified the themes of "feeling for work" and "acting and artistry" as parts of a tacit knowledge in
elder care. The processes of knowledge and job execution are closely intertwined, making them difficult to separate or even
understand without a deeper insight.

material, ending with a table to give an overview of the anal-
ysis. The final section of the article consists of a discussion
of the themes in the analysis and their implications.
Background
About 86,800 people in Sweden above the age of 65 live in
special housing accommodations, known as elder care units,
whereas 163,600 people receive home help care in ordinary
housing. Together, these groups amount to 14% of the popu-
lation in that age group (Socialtjänsten, 2012). Staff in elder
care in Sweden, also referred to as care workers, are employed
either as nurse assistants or as auxiliary nurses (Ahnlund,
2008b), as is the case at Bayside Park and Stonewood Manor.
The formal educational training for nurse assistants is an
upper secondary education, health care support training, or
nursing assistant training. Auxiliary nurses have completed
either the Upper Secondary Health Care Program or a
32-week supplementary course (Ahnlund, 2008b). Working
as a manager in elder care usually requires a bachelor's
degree in social work or social care.
Working in elder care is considered low status work
(Wrede, Henriksson, Høst, Johansson, & Dybbroe, 2008)
and is associated with stressful working conditions
(Trydegård, 2012). The situation in Swedish elder care, along
with care work in all the Nordic countries, has been described
as being in crisis (Wrede et al., 2008), a characterization not
confined only to the Nordic countries (Longhofer & Floersch,
2006). According to Longhofer and Floersch (2006), the ori-
gin of the knowledge crisis in social work stems from theory-
to-practice gaps (the authors Longhofer and Floersch call
them "phenomenological practice gaps") that lead to a deval-
uing of practical knowledge. The variations of care within
each of the Nordic countries imply that there are multiple
crises rather than a crisis in one single area, thus showing the
complex nature of welfare. The knowledge base for staff has
been identified as one of three areas of crisis, which can fur-
thermore be intertwined with the other two areas of crisis:
recruitment of personnel for care work and undervaluation of
care work (Wrede et al., 2008). The issue of a knowledge
base for staff is, however, complex because it raises ques-
tions about the specific nature of this knowledge (Payne,
2001). Given that this knowledge might differ among coun-
tries, the knowledge base in social work is a national matter.2
Payne suggests that viewing social work as a process of con-
structing and reconstructing knowledge is a more beneficial
way of studying knowledge than viewing it as a given knowl-
edge base.
The collected material and this text belong to a rich tradi-
tion of researching the elder care sector. Others have
described and explained parts of elder care from the perspec-
tive of staff, residents, or family members (Eliasson, 1994;
Harnett, 2010; Melin Emilsson, 1998). This text, however,
focuses specifically on tacit knowledge for staff in elder care.
Tacit knowledge, connected to professionalization, has been
debated in Sweden since the 1980s (Molander, 1992). This
article continues this discussion and will elaborate the issue
of tacit knowledge below.
Method and Analysis
This article is a result of a study focusing on exploring and
analyzing working life conditions in elder care, with special
attention to knowledge. To address this focus, an ethno-
graphic study of participant observations was initiated as a
way of understanding the complex everyday life for care
workers at elder care units. The method is appropriate
according to Gans (1999) because it can enable the researcher
to see what actually happens in interactions between people
and aims at making sense of unknown worlds (Agar, 1986).
Kostera (2007) points to the objective in ethnography of
helping us to learn, not merely take notes of what happens,
an intention especially appropriate when focusing on the
issue of knowledge.
The first author initiated contact with the municipality
chosen for the study in 2008 and spent 5 months going to
the first unit (Bayside Park) for observations. The observa-
tions at the second unit (Stonewood Manor) were initiated
in winter 2009 and completed in fall 2010; a total of 5
months was also spent at the second unit. Both elder care
units are part of the public care system in the municipality
chosen for the project. Two to three days per week were
spent at each unit, ranging from a couple of hours per day
to entire days. The days of the week and the times were
alternated to yield insight into the different tasks scheduled.
Consequently, the first author spent a total of 10 months at
the two separate elder care units for the participant observa-
tions of staff in everyday work situations; in addition, the
contact with each unit is ongoing. The second and third
authors have taken part in planning the project as well as
analyzing material. The collected empirical material con-
sists of notes from these observations as well as formal
interviews and informal conversations (small talk) with
staff during the observations. The observations were initi-
ated and pursued with an open characteristic, with the
observer engaging in the daily lives at the two elder care
units. The first author spent time with staff and followed
them around the elder care units and observed the work.
When asked to help in a certain situation, the first author
would respond and act but would not initiate this engage-
ment. The observations were written down in a notepad,
and the first author focused especially on capturing direct
quotes from staff members in situations that seemed rele-
vant considering the overall aim of the study. In this sense,
the analysis of the field notes as material was initiated
while in the field because these observations over time
became more and more focused.
Although the beginning of the observations introduced an
interest in all of the diversity of the care work, after some
time in the field, the first author found it easier to focus
Börjesson et al. 3
specifically on the nature of knowledge as it took form at the
two units. The hand-written field notes were subsequently
transcribed into a Word document. These notes were dense
and contained no specific analysis (or feelings or emotions
experienced by the first author when engaging in these obser-
vations). Documenting the field notes in this manner has
been called "naïve notes" (Tjora, 2011) and is usually fol-
lowed by an elaborated description of events and emotions,
as was the case in this study. The document of the observa-
tions was thus accompanied by another document recording
the experience and emotions of the first author, connected to
these observations.
Ethnographic analysis starts when the topic of a study is
chosen (Fetterman, 2010). After completing the participant
observations, a work of identifying patterns in the field notes
proceeds. The findings are presented here as themes from the
empirical material, similar to what Fetterman (Fetterman,
2010) describes. The main category is tacit knowledge, con-
taining two main themes: "feeling for the work" and "acting
and artistry." The identified themes each represent several
situations occurring at both elder care units, and the empiri-
cal material thus guided the deepened analysis after comple-
tion of the observations.
Ethical Considerations
A regional ethics research board ruled that this study did not
need an ethical approval but rather a recommendation of how
to proceed (no 148-08). At both units, the managers ensured
that all staff members agreed to the presence of a researcher
as a participant observer. How the discussion went when
informing the staff groups is, however, unknown, and the
authors can only trust that no one felt obligated to participate
in the study. The first unit, Bayside Park, is a unit for people
with dementia. Ten older people live in their own apartments
that are included in the unit, connected by a kitchen and com-
mon area. Bayside Park is a locked unit, and physical access
to it depends on the staff. Although the apartments during the
research period were kept unlocked, they were entered only
when the older person (the resident) was present. During the
observations, the first author would accompany staff in their
work into the resident apartments. The second unit,
Stonewood Manor, also consists of older people living in
their own apartments but is not restricted to people with
dementia. It is a bigger unit, with apartments connected to
the elderly residence. The access to Stonewood Manor also
depends on staff, and during the study period, the first author
would follow them to different apartments. The staff toilet
even had to be unlocked, as needed. At both Bayside Park
and Stonewood Manor, there was no place for the researcher
to withdraw.
The ethical implications in a study such as this need to be
addressed along the way and cannot all be unraveled before
initiating the study. Several situations during the participant
observations presented various dilemmas to the first author.
One of these dilemmas was the issue of the researcher's
involvement in the participant observations and how to
respond to requests from both care workers and residents,
similarly described by Tinney (2008). This dilemma of roles
in participant observations was addressed during the jour-
ney of the observations, resulting in the understanding that
the roles fluctuate over time and in various situations
(Börjesson, 2014). Another ethical dilemma presented itself
when the participant observations at Stonewood Manor
were initiated and the manager wanted the first author to
report back experiences from the observations. This request
came as a surprise and was politely declined, as this approach
would have been unethical for the study. The participant
observations needed to build on a mutual respect between
the first author and the care workers and would not have
been as candid or spontaneous if they had felt supervised
and controlled. The implication from these experiences in
this study is that the ethical considerations should be seen as
an ongoing process, rather than yielding definitive answers
from the beginning.
Theoretical Links
Silent knowledge as a concept in practical care can in aca-
demic terms be described as tacit knowledge. Philosopher
Michael Polanyi (1966) defined the concept of tacit knowl-
edge as a nonlinguistic, intuitive, and unconscious form of
knowledge. In other words, "We can know more than we can
tell" (p. 27). Polanyi first explored the concept of tacit
knowledge as knowing as an art, as a skill of the knower
(1998). An example of this unconscious form of knowledge
is offered by Polanyi (1966) in the form of how we recognize
faces. We can identify a familiar face among thousands of
faces; it is, however, less likely that we can verbally express
exactly what we recognize about the face. This same idea
represents tacit knowledge because it is intuitive and uncon-
scious but not verbally expressed. Tacit knowledge can fur-
thermore be derived from Edmund Husserl (the classical
philosopher) and the notion that we all attribute experiences
to a taken-for-granted frame of reference. This frame of ref-
erence means that understandings are taken for granted and
not articulated or even questioned. Longhofer and Floersch
(2006) address tacit (vs. explicit) knowledge in their essay
discussing the crisis in social work and its origin. Social
work can be said to constitute one of two broad bearings
when attempting to understand its everyday practice and
occurrences (Longhofer & Floersch, 2006). The first empha-
sizes the subjective experience of both clients and practitio-
ners; the second viewpoint highlights "the performance of
social work activities," how social workers act, and the con-
sequences of these actions. The Swedish ethnographic
researcher Philip Lalander (2009) discusses the concept of
know-how, which also bears similarities to a tacit knowl-
edge. Know-how constitutes the specific skills and the spe-
cific knowledge needed in a certain situation, in this case, the
4 SAGE Open
work situation for staff in elder care. Know-how is based on
experience of the field and of the work.
The idea of knowledge being unarticulated and uncon-
scious is by no means an undisputed area. Several research-
ers have addressed the problematic nature of an unconscious
and unarticulated knowledge, such as Rolf (1995), who
points to several troubling issues with this idea. One is the
matter of knowledge necessitating a verbalization; another
one is the view that knowledge needs to be argumentative,
confirmed by arguments. Molander (1992) correspondingly
raises a main problem with tacit knowledge being under-
stood as unarticulated knowledge: How can a critical stance
toward knowledge be used if aspects of knowledge are tacit
and therefore protected? This text does not aim at focusing
on those problematic aspects of tacit knowledge; rather, it
uses the concept to deepen the understanding of the complex
nature of care work in elder care and the specific knowledge
needed in this context. For the purpose of this study and anal-
ysis, Polanyi's (1966) definition of tacit knowledge is used,
understanding tacit knowledge as an intuitive and uncon-
scious form of knowledge. Nishikawa (2011) similarly links
tacit knowledge to care workers as a way of identifying
knowledge needed in elder care. In addition to Polanyi's
definition, Nishikawa further described tacit knowledge as
personal and context-specific, making it difficult to formal-
ize and communicate. Nishikawa found that the contextual
aspects of care work require recognition of the dialogue and
collective part of care work, rather than emphasizing formal
education. When studying the quality of care in elder care,
formal education was found to affect the quality of care less
than the context-specific reflections made (Nishikawa,
2011).
Harald Swedner (1996), the first professor of social work
in Sweden, compared the social work profession with a
three-legged stool, where the three legs symbolize compo-
nents of the profession: knowledge, ethics, and artistry. The
artistry and acting skills in this study are linked to a drama-
turgical sociology. Dramaturgical sociology (Aakvaag, 2011)
is often, though not always, associated with the symbolic
interactionist perspective that stems from Mead (1934) and
Blumer (1969). Dramaturgy is a way of focusing on the
expressive and dramatic dimensions in interaction (Edgley,
2003). It is interested in social acts and emergent meanings
and is the study of how human beings accomplish meaning-
ful lives. "It is not primarily interested in what people do, nor
what they intend to do, nor even why they do it, but how they
do it that is the dramaturgical curiosity" (Brissett & Edgley,
2009, p. 3). Dramaturgical sociology entails a way of view-
ing our actions and others' responses to those actions as a
theater stage. According to the sociologist Goffman (1959),
life can be understood by viewing people as actors entering
stages using props belonging to the setting. The performance
is with or without fellow actors in front of an audience.
When creating our self, response from an audience is vital.
An actor can furthermore be honest or cynical; the cynical
actor recognizes the role being played whereas the honest
actor identifies with the role, unaware of the acting taking
place.
Findings
The construction and reconstruction of knowledge in practi-
cal elder care can be described in various ways. The situation
noted in the quote below occurred after the first author had
spent about 4 months at the elder care unit Stonewood Manor
as a participant observer:
I (the first author) am at Stonewood Manor, following Rachel (a
temporary worker) up to Sonja (a resident). We enter a dark
apartment; Rachel looks into the bedroom, but the bed is made
and empty. We continue to the TV room, and there is Sonja,
sitting/half lying down in an armchair. Rachel touches her on the
leg and says, "Good morning." She speaks loudly to Sonja.
Sonja goes into the bathroom, and Rachel goes into the kitchen.
Rachel puts a coffee pot (one that belongs to a coffee machine)
on a stove plate and turns the heat on. Sonja comes in the kitchen
and sees this. "But what have you done?! This is wrong; first I
want tea in that one (pointing at a kettle; my remark). You have
to pour back the water now! This is no help, it is better if I do this
myself, this is more work for me! You are no use! You know
nothing!"
Rachel and I return to the staff room; Cecilia (another staff
member) is there when we arrive. She asks if we are ready and
says that we should go to Gösta (another resident). On our way
there, Rachel tells Cecilia that Sonja was furious with her.
Cecilia: "Oh?" Rachel: "There was a pot ready so I thought that
was the one to use." Cecilia: "No, it is the big kettle you warm
water in. Then you add some water to the other pot for the sugar
to dissolve, and then you add the rest. And then you boil
semolina pudding, very loose. We could have told you this
before you went upstairs since she is so strict about that." Cecilia
laughs. Rachel smiles back.
As the time as an observer continued, situations similar to
this one occurred. The quote thus illustrates the complex sit-
uation in the daily life at an elder care unit and the various
scenarios care workers face. Very specific knowledge is
needed in each care situation, and the responsibility to solve
each situation lies on the care workers.
The Interactional Knowledge--at
Bayside Park and Stonewood Manor
The participant observations revealed an everyday life at the
two elder care units that comprised complex relationships
and interactions between staff members as well as between
staff members and residents. Two of the themes recognized
or identified in the field notes from the two elder care units
are "feeling for the work" and "acting and artistry"; they are
one way of understanding and explaining the tacit knowl-
edge for staff. This section with quotes is summed up with a
Börjesson et al. 5
table to give an overview of the empirical material, before
the discussion:
You are supposed to do so much today, more and more things,
but we don't have any time dedicated for it . . . We do less today
than before; for instance, we don't administer catheters anymore.
More of these things are done by nurses, things that really we
could do. We talk a lot to relatives . . . (Care worker at Bayside
Park)
The quote above was documented by the first author dur-
ing the first weeks of participant observations at Bayside
Park. It incorporates the duality experienced in changed
working conditions and work tasks over time. On the one
hand, there are more expectations and demands; on the other,
the staff feels as if they do fewer tasks for which they are
specifically qualified. The observations revealed an every-
day life emphasizing a certain feeling required for care work
along with acting or artistic elements. Although many of the
staff members value theoretical knowledge and the impor-
tance it has for their work, common sense may often be val-
ued even more highly. This common sense encompasses
much of what is needed in everyday life at an elder care unit.
Feeling for the Work
Care workers at both units emphasized a specific "feeling"
that is needed when performing care work, as the quote
below exemplifies:
You can read a lot, but you also have to have a certain feeling for
this work, and not everyone has that. (Care worker at Bayside
Park)
Care workers describe this feeling as something that you
just have (or do not have). It is deeply embedded in a per-
son's personality or being. When addressing this issue of a
certain feeling needed for their care work, "a" feeling is men-
tioned. Accentuating "a" feeling furthermore seems to imply
the idea that only one version of this feeling counts and that
there are not several options. Only one way of understanding
this feeling is needed, and this specific feeling will then help
staff be perceptive enough to each resident's needs and thus
ensure a job well performed. This needed feeling serves as a
tool in everyday work for the care workers. More often than
specific methods are mentioned and talked about, the feeling
is the basis on which care work is then carried out.
You have to treat each person the way they want to be treated,
not the way I would want to be treated. (Care worker at Bayside
Park)
Care workers at Stonewood Manor similarly describe this
importance of a feeling and the necessity to adapt behavior
according to what the residents want. On one occasion, the
first author was sitting withAstrid and Tove in the staff room,
who brought the issue up. There is a lot of laughter in the
conversation:
Tove, to me (the first author): "The boss has said that we need to
behave when you are here."
Astrid nods her head saying: "But we gotta be ourselves. She
thinks we are annoying."
Tove agrees: "There's talk about the industry but I don't know, I
think it's tougher here." We all laugh.
Yeah (saysAstrid), we are a bit tough like that, we have "jargon,"
but you have to be able to be yourself. Of course, we're not like
that with all of the residents. Some we have a lot of jargon with,
but they like it!
First author: "How do you know that?"
Astrid explains: "Yeah, but you get a feeling for that pretty soon.
In the beginning you are a bit like: `hi, hi,' but then you just
know."
Tove nods and adds: "You have to sense how they want to be,
you can't be the same way towards everyone."
The way to treat everyone individually is by being per-
ceptive of each person's needs to respond to them. Apart
from the feeling emphasized, "plain common sense" is simi-
lar to feelings highlighted by the care workers. This plain
common sense is mentioned as one of the most important
parts of the knowledge needed for their work, for example,
by this care worker at Stonewood Manor:
On our way back to the staff room, Elsie (one of the care
workers) thinks out loud about the issue of knowledge and
competence. "I think that you can come a long way with plain
common sense. You think about these things, what is my
competence really . . ." Elsie tells me that she sometimes thinks
that someone else in the staff group does something really well.
Other colleagues solve situations in a good way. When I ask her
if they talk about these things in the staff group, she says, "yes,"
and I ask what these situations can be. "Well, the last time it was
Anna, who told me about Klas (a resident) having a stroke.
When she told us, I thought about how well she solved that. I
didn't tell her then but I told her later. Damn, what great
colleagues I have, I'm really proud!"
Unlike the feeling required for care work, plain common
sense is not infused with emotions but is about knowing what
to do and when to do it. Plain common sense is not some-
thing that can be acquired through education and training; it
is acquired through experience that comes from life in gen-
eral and from work--more specifically from the care work.
The experiences of each care worker can also be shared
within the staff groups while emphasizing each care work-
er's specific experience and skills.
6 SAGE Open
Acting and Artistry
The feeling and common sense needed in daily work at the
elder care units also enable the care workers to act out their
work. At both Bayside Park and Stonewood Manor, staff
members emphasize the perceptive ability needed in care
work and the need to adjust to each individual in each situa-
tion. This ability is identified in this analysis as acting and
artistry. Shortly after initiating the observations at Bayside
Park, the first author made notes about care work that could
be compared with the use of masks being put on and off and
the idea of work duties perceived as a performance by staff.
The ability to incorporate an artistic skill is a part of the daily
work for care workers:
After a few weeks of observations at Bayside Park, a journalist
and a photographer from a local newspaper come to visit. They
are there to hear about and see the result of a project on dancing
and movement that some of the care workers have been involved
in. Dancing is used as a way of connecting with the residents.
The care workers have prepared for this visit from the newspaper
by asking some of the residents' relatives about consent to take
photos of them. Music is put on in the common area, and some
of the care workers invite the residents to join them dancing. The
photographer makes sure to arrange the picture well, aiming the
camera at smiling residents.
The first author made notes about the situation above, and
the feeling of being an audience:
As the pictures are taken, the dancing fades out, the music is
turned off and people go back to various things. It is as if the
actors have left the stage for this time and it is empty again,
waiting for a new performance.
Later, during observation of staff at Stonewood Manor,
one of the care workers brings up acting when asked about
how to adapt to all the different situations and different
people: "One of our previous managers once said that we
are the best actors. Since we adapt so well." In some
instances or situations at the elder care units, this adaptabil-
ity was more evident, like the episode above as well as this
one:
When visiting Bayside Park one day, the first author was
sitting in the common area in the kitchen together with some
residents and two staff members. One of the staff members,
Anna, was talking to the residents and joking. Her shift was
ending, and she was about to leave for the day, as she asks the
residents if they would like her to sing something before she
leaves. "You want me to sing an aria?! Okay, la la la laaaaa!"
She stands up and moves towards the door, she takes a bow to
the "audience" (the residents accompanied by a colleague and
the first author) and exits the locked door in a "dramatic way,"
as if exiting an opera stage. Everyone in the "audience" in the
common room laughs, and Alma (one of the residents) says:
"She should also be an inmate (here), that one!" followed by
more laughter.
When Alma says that Anna should be an inmate, she
implies being an inmate in the setting in which she herself
lives, the elder care unit. Despite having a dementia diagno-
sis, she is aware of her home being situated in a closed and
even locked unit, as she talks about it in the context of being
an inmate (in a correctional facility). Anna's performance
becomes a way of bonding with the residents and blurring
the differences between staff and residents. Anna comes to
work and puts her work suit on, or what staff and the man-
ager at Bayside Park call "the professional coat." This coat is
the suit for their specific work; it encompasses knowledge
and skills needed as well as the distance required for their
work. The coat is furthermore visualized by the working
clothes care workers use, although not all staff members use
them. When asking about this, staff members respond that
the working clothes emphasize the institutional setting, an
emphasis that they do not wish to support.
At Bayside Park, the staff has decided not to take long
breaks during their shifts. To avoid confusing the residents
by disappearing too long, they suggested to their manager
that it was better to stay with the residents the whole time.
This idea had been under discussion for some time when the
first author came to the unit and was shared by the manager,
who saw it as a positive thing and an act of solidarity from
her staff. In line with the later identified theme of artistry and
acting, the wish to skip breaks could be seen as a way of stay-
ing in character and keeping "the show" going.
Discussion
The situation in Swedish elder care, focusing on increased
quality by increased knowledge for staff, has left out crucial
aspects of the understanding of knowledge production. Tacit
knowledge is commonly referred to in care work in general
and elder care in particular as the crucial knowledge needed
that does not entail theoretical knowledge from formal edu-
cation. It has, however, received little or no recognition in
recent discussions about quality improvement in elder care.
To understand the production of knowledge in elder care and
thus enable actual changes in practice, tacit knowledge needs
to be recognized as a vital factor, in line with Nishikawa's
findings. Knowledge needed in care work cannot be acquired
merely through formal training, which has been the focus in
recent years. From the experience at Bayside Park and
Stonewood Manor, tacit knowledge can be understood as
consisting of a feeling for work along with artistic skills.
The ability to incorporate an artistic skill in the work is
seemingly a vital part of the daily work for care workers at
Bayside Park and Stonewood Manor, as exemplified in table
1. The quote by Alma illustrates the creation of care work as
including and being dependent on the interaction of staff and
residents; care work is created together by staff and the peo-
ple being cared for, as discussed by Szebehely (2005), among
others.Alma's quote furthermore illustrates how care work is
created in the moment. The moment makes the opportunity

because these interactions based on acting cannot be sched-
uled or planned.
Along the lines of Goffman, the actors in this scenario are
the care workers who enter the stage in each encounter and
meet with the residents (and fellow care workers). The props
the care workers use are needed in the setting of elder care
and both are found at the elder care units or sometimes
brought there by themselves. The performances by the care
workers or actors are sometimes in front of an audience of
residents or other care workers. The care workers at Bayside
Park and Stonewood Manor are both honest and cynical;
some of them refer to the setting and the roles being played
whereas others seem to perform their duties with less con-
sciousness of their setting. The examples of feeling for work
and artistry and acting skills can be understood by using
Goffman's (1959) theory on the self. In line with Goffman,
the resident apartments can be seen as the stages or open
arenas. In this scenario, the staff room provides the off-stage
area where the care workers can relax and remove the profes-
sional masks.
The line between the front and back regions can, however,
be unclear, as Cain (2012) illustrated and discussed. Cain
depicts the two regions as being both staged as well as feel-
ing authentic by care workers. At Bayside Park, the staff
room is very small and has just enough room for a small two-
seat couch and a dining table and a few chairs. When staff
members go there, it is to heat some food for very short
breaks. At Bayside Park, the kitchen and common area
become a natural stage for the acting, in a more evident way
than at Stonewood Manor where the apartments are spread
out and staff meet together only in the staff room. At
Stonewood Manor, the staff room consists of two rooms for
the care workers, and they try to meet there during the day
for coffee and lunch, when the schedule allows for it.
As an observer in the field, the first author was the audi-
ence, at times included in the performance and other times
merely observing the act. The staff members used their pro-
fessional masks and performed their duties. To some extent,
these duties were mutually agreed with the residents and pre-
viously decided on by the manager and the residents. This
setup left little room for flexibility or deviations from either
staff or residents. They followed their routines and stuck to
the script. The staff members then withdrew to the staff
room, which was off-stage. Here the masks were removed, to
various degrees, and the staff relaxed from the pressures of
their work. The staff joked about the residents and about
each other. These jokes--when positively performed--
formed the glue for the group. When presented in a negative
manner, they instead emphasized the differences in the group
and created or fed negative emotions and feelings. The masks
were more easily removed and put on again at Stonewood
Manor, where there were more explicit boundaries for the
staff. Staff was required to perform their work and do it well,
but there was no talk or expectation about duties beyond that.
The manager was specific in requests and asked for loyalty,
but this was according to the schedule and did not go beyond
that. The manager was sometimes restrictive about extra
duties or performances, always referring to their obligations
by law and regulations. At Bayside Park, staff was expected
to go beyond their work obligations. They were encouraged
to do "that little extra." Although not explicitly ordered to do
so, the staff members who did go the extra mile could be
considered more devoted to their work.
Acting, or putting on a role or mask, can furthermore be
seen as a way of distancing oneself from others. It becomes a
way of handling or dealing with difficult and straining work.
When actively used (consciously or unconsciously), acting
skills can serve as a tool in everyday work at elder care units.
Moreover, "performing" in work can be a way of enabling
support for residents in various ways. The feeling for work
discussed in this text can similarly be seen as a tool in care
work by which care work is organized and performed. These

Themes
Quotes from the empirical
material
How is this expressed at Bayside Park
and Stonewood Manor? Summary
1. Feeling for work "You can read a lot, but you
also have to have a certain
feeling for this kind of work
and not everyone has that."
" . . . you can come a long way
with plain common sense"
Care workers express the importance
of the right feeling for work, which
cannot be attained--it is just there
(or not).
As a way of emphasizing the down-
to-earth aspects of care work, care
workers use common sense as an
antipole to theoretical knowledge.
The theme is everyday inner
qualities not visible but
nevertheless a part of the daily
routines.
2. 
Acting skills and
artistry
"You want me to sing an
aria?! Okay, la la la laaaa!,"
(Anna, care worker, exits in a
dramatic way).
"We use our professional
coat."
Masks are used to act out care work
in various scenarios, both as a way
of connecting to residents and as a
way of distancing oneself from the
care work.
Props are used in daily work (can be
actual things or fictional).
The theme is of an artistic nature;
they are expressed and visible
with immediate effect.

two identified themes stand out when observing staff in elder
care, and the joint understanding of them is that neither is
achieved by academic knowledge. So, although the national
directives may be an increased level of knowledge to improve
the quality of care for the older persons, the care workers
themselves have their own focus. Formal education is con-
sidered important, but the feeling that they have for the work
is equally important. This feeling, along with the idea that
their work is carried out as acting in plays, can be said to be
part of the tacit knowledge.
When analyzing the empirical material and identifying
themes, several questions arose: Who decides about the
nature of this feeling for work? Who decides whether the
feeling is the right one--is it fellow care workers? Using this
mandate of deciding about the right version of feelings can
be a way of using one's power in a restricting environment
and organization. Similar questions about acting in elder care
would benefit from further research, and the prerequisites
and conditions for this acting should be further elaborated.
Who can be said to be directing this act? Where is (are) the
stage(s), and who are the actors? Inherent in the care work
and practice is the idea of doing good for others. Being good
or doing good is part of the professional view of caring work.
This being and doing can be what is expected from care
workers, and they can choose to live up to these expectations
or to question them. Can acting then be a way of distancing
oneself from expectations from the organization, managers,
colleagues, and care recipients? Taking on a role can further
be a way for care workers to take on a critical approach
toward the work.
While the organizational view on knowledge for care
workers (as a way of increasing the quality of care of older
persons) is focused on theoretical formal education, this
study highlights the need to recognize the knowledge shared
through interaction. In line with Nishikawa (2011), this study
shows that tacit knowledge and a context of shared knowl-
edge are crucial aspects of care work. Further research in this
area should include a focus on residents in the interaction
with staff to identify these themes and how residents use
them. Are residents living in an institutional setting similarly
guided by a certain feeling for what is suitable at an elder
care unit, and are they similarly acting in their interactions
with staff?
We understand and recognize knowledge use for staff in
elder care to be part of a process of knowledge making and
knowledge shaping, through a feeling for care work along
with acting in daily work. This interaction occurs and is
shared in the midst of everyday work chores. The processes
of knowledge and job execution are closely intertwined,
making it difficult to separate them or even understand them
without acknowledging what links them.

names are used when referring to the two elder care units as
well as to staff and residents.
2. In Sweden, organized elder care is connected to social work
through its organization and distribution.
