The focus of this article is to determine the probability of making transitions through various
ADL limitation levels, controlling for gender, age, and baseline ADL level, and using death as a
competing outcome. We use the four waves of the Longitudinal Study of Aging and categorical
data techniques to model the probability of these transitions. We find much heterogeneity
among the transitions, with significant age and functional limitation effects. We also find that
death and functional limitations are not necessarily highly linked.

Functional Limitation Pathways
and Transitions in Community-Dwelling
Older Persons1

Activities of Daily Living (ADL) limitations are a
prevalent problem in older populations. About 20%
of community-dwelling persons 65 years of age and
older in the United States report having some diffi-
culty with ADLs (Van Nostrand, Furner, & Suzman,
1993). This prevalence doubles for those over the age
of 85, with women having higher rates than men.
Without reductions in these age-specific preva-
lences, ADL functional limitations will become even
more important from a public health perspective as
the population ages.
Age-specific prevalences of ADL limitations do not
by themselves capture the true dynamics of func-
tional change. Physical function can improve, stay
the same, or worsen over time (Branch, Katz, Kniep-
mann, & Papsidero, 1984; Crimmons & Saito, 1993;
Manton, 1988; Mor, Wilcox, Rakowski, & Hiris, 1994;
Strawbridge, Kaplan, Camacho, & Cohen, 1992;
Verbrugge & Balaban, 1989). Furthermore, functional
limitations are one of many competing outcomes,
such as death, for older persons. Knowledge of the
dynamics of health transitions is critically important
for understanding and elucidating the natural history
of function as well as for planning medical care and

social services to mitigate the effects of functional
limitations.
The literature on aging and functional limitations
fails to fully address several key issues. Most studies
dichotomize ADL function, classifying respondents
as either limited or nonlimited with regard to physi-
cal function. Because ADL functioning has many lev-
els and is not, therefore, a truly dichotomous mea-
sure, these analyses mask potentially important
information about more subtle levels of physical
ability as well as movement among various states of
limitation.
Movement, or change in function, has typically
been examined using just two independent mea-
surements. As physical function is related to a variety
of medical conditions and social factors that fluctu-
ate over time, we believe that transitions among
states of functional limitation are both diverse and
highly dynamic. A more longitudinal perspective,
incorporating multiple measurements, may better
capture the subtleties of movement among states as
well as any patterns in this movement.
Common stereotypes of aging depict death as a
logical extension of limited functional ability. Yet,
previous studies have shown that fatal conditions
differ from the conditions associated with functional
limitations (Rudberg & Cassel, 1993). Although few
studies have explicitly examined the relationship be-
tween functional limitations and death, we believe
that these two conditions are not highly linked.
In this article, we examine the six-year history of
functional limitations in a sample of noninstitutional-
ized men and women, 70 years of age and older, who
are living in the United States. The primary purpose of
the article is to examine the probabilities of making
transitions from one state of limitation to another,
using death as a competing outcome, over a series of

two-year time periods. In so doing, we are able to
document the degree of change experienced by per-
sons in the study sample and to detect typical patterns
of change. The analyses are adjusted for gender and
age, because these variables have been found to be
strongly associated with functional limitations.
Methods
Data
The Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA), a joint
project of the National Institute on Aging and the
National Center for Health Statistics, is a prospec-
tive study of the changes in health and functional
ability that accompany the process of aging in the
United States (Fitti & Kovar, 1987; Kovar, 1987). The
LSOA monitored a representative sample (n =
5,151) of the nation's noninstitutionalized civilian
population, 70 years of age and older, for six years
(1984-1990). Extensive baseline information about
each subject's health, functional abilities and other
characteristics was obtained through in-home inter-
views in 1984. Follow-up information was collected
every two years through telephone interviews and
continuously through Medicare records and the Na-
tional Death Index.
Measures
ADL Functional Limitation Measures. -- In this
article, functional limitations are defined as self-
reported difficulty (yes/no) with the following ADLs:
(a) bathing, (b) dressing, (c) eating, (d) getting in/out
of bed/chair, and (e) toileting. At each time period,
the level or state of a person's functional limitation is
the sum of these ADL limitations. This measure
therefore ranges from 0 (no functional limitations) to
5 (complete functional limitations).
Self-reported difficulty with an activity is used to
measure functional limitation in order to best repre-
sent a person's ability. Compared with other mea-
sures of functional ability (e.g., receiving help with a
particular activity), difficulty performing an activity
may be more influenced by a person's individual
capacity and less reflective of environmental influ-
ences. Previous studies have also shown self-
reported ADL limitations to be a valid measure (Elam
et al., 1991; Sager et al., 1992; Weinberger et al.,
1992).
Functional Limitation Pathways. -- Interviews for
the LSOA took place in 1984,1986,1988, and 1990. For
this study, those years correspond to the time points
t = 0, 1, 2, 3. Each time point is called a wave, and
each wave represents a two-year time history. Per-
sons with missing data were excluded from the study
sample so that each person can be represented by a
fourtuple, each element of which represents his or
her ADL state or level for a particular wave.
We define a functional limitation pathway for a
person as the fourtuple
(ADL,,ADL2
,ADL3
,ADLA
),
where ADL, denotes a person's ADL limitation state at
time t. For example, a person who had no ADL
limitations in 1984, two ADL limitations in 1986 and
1988, and four ADL limitations in 1990 would be
represented by the sequence (0,2,2,4). A person who
had four ADL limitations in 1984, five ADL limitations
in 1986, and died in 1988 would be represented by
the sequence (4,5,D,D), where D represents death.
Analyses
We modeled the wave-to-wave probabilities of
transitioning among levels of functional limitation
and of dying. The ADL states 0,..., 5 are called tran-
sient, because a person may move from any one of
these states to any other. Conversely, death is
deemed an absorbing state (see Figure 1).
Two separate discrete data regression models
were used to model the transitional probabilities at
each wave. In examining the relationship between
functional limitation and death, we used a binary
logistic regression model. An ordinal logistic regres-
sion model (Walker & Duncan, 1967) was used to
examine the transitions among levels of functional
limitations. In both models, we controlled for pre-
vious functional limitation status and gender. We
adjusted for age by stratifying the study sample into
three age groups: 70 to 79, 80 to 89, and 90 years of
age and older, based on age at the outset of each
wave. Separate models were then fit to each age
strata. We tested for time homogeneity in the model
parameter estimates using a Wald type test, de-
scribed in detail later. As the data are time-
homogeneous, we combined the waves and pro-
duced one set of parameter estimates for each
model.
Modeling the Relationship Between Functional
Limitations and Death. -- We use Dit
to denote the
death status of the /'th individual at wave t, with O,f
=
1 denoting dead, and Dit
= 0 indicating that the
respondent was alive at the outset of wave t. We
define previous functional limitation state at time t-
1 as ADL,;M
and gender as gender^ Males are coded as
1 and females as 0.
At each transition, we fit the following regres-
sion model:
logit[Prob(Dit
= 1 | ADL,^, gender,, D,M
* 1)] =
K + ,.M
= s) + Vb
,,genderif
t = 1,2,3,
where the notation l{ADLit
^ = s) is defined as
(1 if individual / has ADL state s
at wave t-1
0 otherwise
The 7x1 parameter vector p, = (po
,,,Pv, · · · /PU' is
estimated using the maximum likelihood method.
From this we obtain the estimate (3, and an associated
covariance matrix.
We are interested in testing the hypothesis Ho
: $,
- P
2 = P3
, which would be true if the death process

is time homogeneous. Because we have repeated
measurements on individuals, the estimates p, are
correlated. Let F denote the estimated covariance
matrix of the vector p = (p1;
p2
/&3)'/ obtained using a
method from Stram, Wei, and Ware (1988). Let /7x7
denote the 7x7 identity matrix and define the matrix
Q -- '7x7 ~'7x7 "7x7
[ U7x
7-/7x7 l7x7
The hypothesis Ho
:& = p2
= p3
may be represented
as Ho
: Cp = 0. The resulting Wald test statistic is 7 =
pC'(CTC)-1Cp, which is distributed as x?4
under the
null hypothesis.
If we fail to reject Ho
, we may pool our data and
estimate one logistic model. Maximum likelihood
estimation assuming independent observations will
produce a consistent estimate, but the resulting co-
variance estimate will be incorrect because it fails to
account for the correlation among observations from
the same person. We therefore use a robust covari-
ance matrix estimate described in Diggle, Liang, and
Zeger (1994) to obtain an asymptotically consistent
covariance estimate.
Assuming time homogeneity, we will obtain an
estimated parameter vector p for each age strata. The
equality of these three parameter vectors may be
tested using the same procedure used to test for time
homogeneity.
Modeling the Transitions Among Levels of Func-
tional Limitations. -- At each transition, we fit the
following ordinal logistic regression model:
logit[Prob(ADLit
^ k \ ADL^, gender,, Dlt
= 0)] =
+ ^ = s) + ^gender,,
* = 1,...,5,t = 1,2,3.
This model is conditional on an individual remaining
alive for the duration of the wave. As with the logistic
model, the parameter vector p, = (po
,t/
pi,f/
.. ·, P6
,,)' is
estimated using the maximum likelihood method,
resulting in the estimated vector p, and an associated
covariance matrix.
We use the same testing procedure as mentioned
in the previous section to test the hypothesis Ho
: $, =
p2
= p3
. If we fail to reject Ho
, we may pool the data
and obtain one parameter estimate p. As before, a
robust covariance matrix estimate is needed because
we have repeated measures on the same individuals.
Assuming time homogeneity, the estimated transi-
tion probabilities may be displayed in a 6x6 transi-
tion probability matrix of the following form:

Life Expectancy. -- The discrete data regression
models produce estimates for (a) the probabilities of
dying within two years, conditional on current func-
tional limitation state, age strata and gender, and (b)
the probabilities of transitioning to another func-
tional limitation state (excluding death) within two
years, conditional on the same variables. By combin-
ing these probabilities (and assuming time homoge-
neity of the parameter estimates), we obtain a 7x7
transition probability matrix, which conveys the
probabilities of transitioning among different levels
of functional limitation while accounting for death as
a competing risk factor:

Note that the sum of each row in the transition matrix
is equal t o 1 .
With the complete transition probability matrix,
we can estimate the average duration of time a per-
son will spend in each limitation level using a simula-
tion study. We simulate 1,000 people, with a particu-
lar age, gender and initial limitation level in 1984. We
then use the complete transition probability matrices
to simulate the movement of these people until
death, recording how often an individual visits any
limitation level. By averaging over all 1,000 individ-
uals, we obtain expected life expectancy and ex-
pected time spent in each functional limitation level.
Missing Data and the Study Sample
The LSOA followed a core sample of 5,151 men and
women through all four waves of data collection. Of
these 5,151 respondents, 3,890 had complete ADL
data at all waves, or complete ADL data prior to
death. These 3,890 respondents are included in our
analyses.
The remaining 1,261 respondents were missing
data on one or more ADL measures across the four
waves of the study. In some cases (e.g., the respon-
dent was in a nursing home or hospital, or the re-
spondent had moved and could not be located) no
follow-up interview was conducted. For most per-
sons, the reason for noninterview was unspecified.
Alternatively, some respondents who were inter-
viewed refused to answer one or more questions
relating specifically to ADL function.
Of the 1,261 respondents excluded from the sam-
ple, only 15 had missing ADL data across all four
waves of the study; 10 of the 15 were respondents
who died having never provided complete ADL in-
formation at any previous wave. Excluding the 55
respondents with missing ADL data at baseline, 266
respondents out of 1,206 had missing ADL data in
1986, 1988, and 1990; 94 of these respondents died
having provided complete ADL information only at
baseline. These data indicate that the vast majority of
excluded respondents did not fail to respond to an
ADL question and then permanently drop out of the
sample due to death or to continued nonresponse.
Rather, most persons with missing ADL information
in a given wave provided complete ADL data at the
next interview.
In order to determine whether and how the 3,890
persons included in our study sample differ at base-
line from the 1,261 who were excluded, we com-
pared the sociodemographic characteristics, func-
tional limitations, and health status of the two
groups. In 1984, the average age of members of the
study sample was 78.1 years, with a range of 70 to 99
years (see Table 1). Eighty-eight percent of the sam-
ple were white and 62% were female; 19% had a post
high school education. Excluded respondents had
very similar characteristics. This group had an aver-
age age of 78.5 years, with a range of 70 to 96 years.
Eighty-five percent of the sample were white and 69%
were female; 14% had a post high school education.
The two groups also had similar distributions of
ADL limitations and levels of self-reported health at
baseline (see Tables 2 and 3). Of the 1,261 persons
excluded from the sample, 55 were missing ADL data
at baseline; therefore, the values displayed in Table 2
are based only on the 1,206 respondents with com-
plete data in 1984. Twenty-two persons in the study
sample and 16 persons in the excluded sample failed
to report on their health status at baseline; they are
excluded from Table 3. Because of the similarity in
health status and sociodemographic characteristics
between our study sample and the excluded sample,
we felt no need to impute the missing cases.

mately 15% of the remaining sample died during
each wave.
Most persons are free of any functional limitations
at each wave, though this number decreases from
81% in the first wave to 58% in the final wave. Of
those with some level of limitation, the most com-
mon state at each wave is one ADL limitation. Func-
tional limitation levels 2 though 5 have a similar
distribution of counts across waves.

Pathways
A total of 1,554 functional limitation pathway com-
binations are possible; however, only 401 pathways
were experienced by this sample. Of these, 190, or
nearly 50%, occurred only once. Forty-three path-
ways occurred at least 10 times; these common path-
ways are listed in Table 5. Over 50% of the common
pathways involve death. When these pathways are
excluded, only 18 functional limitation pathways are
reported by 10 or more respondents, illustrating the
great diversity of experience with functional ability in
the sample.
The most common pathway (followed by 34% of
the study sample) is (0,0,0,0), the pathway of no
functional limitation at each wave. The second most
common pathway is (0,D,D,D), or no functional limi-
tation followed by death. The pathways (0,0,D,D)
and (0,0,0,D) are the third and fifth most common.
Indeed, 48% of the 1,520 deaths reported over the
six-year period occurred among respondents with no
functional limitations at any previous wave. An addi-
tional 1% of deaths occurred among respondents
who had experienced a functional limitation in the
past, but had reported no limitations at the preced-
ing interview.
The Relationship Between Functional Limitations
and Death
Using the Wald-type test outlined in the Methods
section, we find that for each age strata, the parame-
ter estimates are time homogeneous (all p values >
.05). The resulting parameter estimates from combin-
ing the wave information for death in each age strata
are displayed in Table 6. The test for equality of the
parameter estimates in each age strata is significant (p
= .016), indicating an age-effect for death. For 70 to 79
and 80- to 89-year-olds, all regression covariates are
statistically significant (p < .01). For those 90 years of
age and older, several covariates are not statistically
significant; these effects are described later.
Using the covariates significantly associated with
death, the predicted probabilities of dying within two
years, conditional on age, gender, and current func-
tional limitation status, are presented in Table 7. Pre-
dicted probabilities are given along with standard
errors of the estimate. Given the same function limita-
tion level, the probability of dying increases with age.
For example, women 70 to 79 years old reporting
difficulty with three ADLs have a 21% (with a 95%

confidence range of [14%-30%]) probability of dying
in the succeeding two-year period; these probabili-
ties are 29% (23%-37%) and 52% (38%-65%) for
women 80 to 89 years old and for women 90 years of
age and older, respectively. This pattern holds across
different levels of functional limitations as well as for
males.
Gender is also an important determinant of risk for
death in the two younger age strata. Men in the two
younger cohorts are more likely to die than women
with similar levels of functional limitation. The risks
of dying for men 70 to 79 and 80 to 89 years of age
with the same functional limitation level as the
women just described (three ADL limitations) are
35% (25%^6%) and 45% (37%-54%). The pattern of
relative advantage for women holds across all levels
of limitation. This notable sex-effect disappears in
the oldest age group. Men and women 90 years of
age and older with similar levels of physical function
are equally likely to die during the succeeding mea-
surement interval (p = .11).
The addition of one ADL limitation has different
effects on the probability of death depending upon
age and the previous number of limitations. For 70-
to 79-year-olds, the probability of dying is roughly
equal given difficulty with two, three, or four ADLs,
for both men and women. For 80- to 89-year-olds, the
relationship between functional limitation and death
is more clearly incremental; each additional limita-
tion significantly increases the risk of death. In the
oldest age group, men and women reporting one
ADL limitation are no more likely to die within the
succeeding two-year period than those with full
functional ability (p = .16). Thereafter, however, the
risk of dying is significantly elevated with each addi-
tional ADL limitation.
In general, men and women with higher levels of
functional limitations are at greater risk for death
than those reporting no difficulty with ADL measures
or low levels of functional limitations. Among 80- to
89-year-old women, those with five ADL limitations
are five times more likely to die in the ensuing two-
year interval than women with none, and 1.5 times
more likely to die than women with three ADL limita-
tions. Nonetheless, women's probability of dying
within a two-year period given five ADL limitations
remains less than 55% until age 90. Even after age 90,
men and women with five ADL limitations have a
two-year probability of survival greater than 30%.
Therefore, although functional limitation confers ad-
ditional risk for death, these phenomena, are not
always closely associated.
Transitions Among Levels of Functional Limitations
Using the Wald-type test outlined in the Methods
section, we find that for each age strata, the parame-
ter estimates are time homogeneous (all p values >
.05). The resulting parameter estimates from combin-
ing the information across waves are displayed in
Table 8. The test for equality of the parameter esti-
mates among the 3 age strata was significant (p =
.012), indicating an age effect for functional transi-
tions. Unlike the relationship between functional
limitations and death, the transitions older people
make from one level of functional limitation to an-
other are not influenced by gender. In each age
group, men and women are equally likely to experi-
ence a shift in ADL status within the two-year mea-
surement interval. The estimated transition matrices
using the significant variables from the ordinal logis-
tic regression model are displayed in Table 9.
Transitions are influenced by age and by the level
of functional limitation reported in the previous
measurement wave. Men and women reporting no
functional limitations are most likely to remain in this
category two years later, though that probability de-
creases with age. Limitation-free individuals 70 to 79
years old have an 86% (85%-87%) chance of main-
taining full functional ability during the succeeding
interval; for those 80 to 89 and 90 years of age and
older, these probabilities are 74% (73%-76%) and
50% (43%-57%) respectively. Similarly, the most
highly limited men and women -- those reporting
difficulty with all five measured ADLs -- are most
likely to remain in this state. For 70- to 79- and 80- to
89-year-olds, the probability of reporting five func-
tional limitations at two consecutive interviews is
63% with accuracy of ±30% for the younger age
group and ±20% for those 80 to 89 years old. Among
those at least 90 years of age, this probability in-
creases to 75%. However, this last estimate is particu-
larly unstable due to the small number of persons
with such characteristics.
Persons with levels of functional limitation some-
where between these two extremes display a signifi-
cant degree of movement among ADL states over

time. Although the data indicate a great deal of het-
erogeneity in these transitions, some general trends
are noted. Given one to three ADL limitations, youn-
ger men and women are more likely to transition to a
lower level of functional limitation than older indi-
viduals. Among those reporting two ADL limitations,
men and women 70 to 79 years old have a 24% (16%-
32%) probability of reporting one limitation and a
33% (19%-47%) probability of reporting no limita-
tions at the next interview. For 80- to 89-year-olds,
the probability of transitioning to either of these
states is equal and 19% ([12%-27%] and [2%-37%]).
For those 90 years of age and older, the likelihood of
experiencing these improvements in functional abil-
ity is 18% (3%-33%) and 11% (0%-61%). This last
estimate is very unstable due to the the small number
of persons with such characteristics.
By contrast, given four or five previous limitations,
men and women in all three age groups show similar
and low probabilities of reducing their level of func-
tional limitation. The probability of reporting any
degree of improved function, given four ADL limita-
tions at the previous interview, is less than 50% for all
age groups. The probabilities of returning to a
limitation-free state are 7% (5%-10%), 6% (4%-9%),
and 4% (3%-6%) for those in the youngest to the
oldest age cohorts, and 2% or less at any age for
those with five ADL limitations.
Complete Transition Matrices and Life Expectancy
By combining the probabilities of dying with the
probabilities of moving among functional limitation
states, we are able to create complete functional
transition matrices (see Tables 10 and 11). These
matrices convey the probabilities of transitioning
among different levels of functional limitation while
accounting for death as a competing risk factor. For
example, limitation-free women, 70 to 79 years of
age, have an 81% chance (79%-83%) of maintaining
full functional ability during the succeeding interval.
For women 80 to 89 and 90 years of age and older,
these probabilities are 65% (64%-79%) and 38%
(30%-45%), respectively. These probabilities are
lower than those found in Table 9, where the com-
peting risk of death is not considered.
The probability of experiencing a specific func-
tional limitation pathway may be computed using the
transition matrix. For example, for an 87-year-old
man with no limitations in 1984, the probability of
going through the pathway (0,0,0,0) is given by
(.592)(.592)(.375) = .13. The probability of such a man
experiencing a transition to another level of limita-
tion or dying over the study period is therefore 87%.
The pathway likelihoods just described are condi-
tional on the initial functional limitation state. To
calculate the unconditional likelihood of experienc-
ing various pathways, we need the initial age and
gender-specific state probabilities. For example, for
70- to 79-year-old women, the probability of having
no ADL limitations in 1984 is estimated from the data
to be 85%. The unconditional likelihood of a 78-year-
old woman experiencing the pathway (0,1,1,2) is
(.85)(.08)(.194)(.123) = .16%.
Given an initial ADL functional limitation level,
Tables 12 and 13 show the average length of time in
years persons will spend in each state prior to death
for ages 70, 80, and 90. For example, 70-year-old
males with three previous ADL limitations will spend
an additional 1.2 years in that state, 2.7 years with no
limitations, and a fraction of a year in all other
limitation states. The sum of these durations equals
the average life expectancy (in years) for similar
individuals.
The tables show a clear decline in life expectancy
based on initial ADL limitation level, regardless of
age and gender. Seventy-year-old men with no pre-
vious limitations live, on average, 1.5 times longer
than those with two initial limitations and 2.6 times
longer than those with five. Nonlimited 80-year-old
men live 1.5 and 2.5 times longer than more limited
men (those with two and five limitations) the same
age; 90-year-old men live 1.4 and 2.0 times longer
than their more limited age-mates. A similar diminu-
tion in relative life expectancies is experienced by
women. Absolute life expectancy for nonlimited
men ranges from 10.9 years for the youngest age
group to 6.1 years for the oldest group.

unique opportunity to examine the changes in physi-
cal function experienced by a community-dwelling
older population. Conceptualizing limitation in
terms of levels or degrees rather than as an either/or
phenomenon allows us to more accurately describe
limitations in older persons, detect changes in their
functional ability, and describe patterns in these
transitions. Given current demographic trends, this
information is becoming increasingly vital.
Men and women in this sample are extremely
heterogeneous with respect to the patterns of limita-
tion they experience. Few limitation pathways are
followed by 10 or more people, and over 50% of the
pathways are unique. Most transitions have a signifi-
cant probability of occurring. However, the probabil-
ity of acquiring additional limitations or of regaining
physical function is not a purely random process;
rather, it is strongly influenced by age and by pre-
vious level of functional ability.
In general, men and women with either high or
low levels of limitation tend to maintain this status,
whereas those with medium levels of limitation show
a great deal of movement and approximately equal
probabilities of transitioning to any level of limita-
tion. Age is an important modifying factor in this
process. The probabilities of acquiring additional
limitations generally increase with age, whereas the
probabilities of regaining physical function de-
crease. However, these effects are not entirely uni-
form; each age group exhibits unique likelihoods of
acquiring or improving functional limitations based
on their previous status.
In this study, gender is unrelated to movement
among levels of functional limitation; men and
women are equally likely to experience improve-
ments or declines in function over the study period.
This finding contradicts the results of previous stud-
ies, which have generally shown women to be more
likely to experience declines in function. However,
many of these studies fail to account for death as a
competing risk for older persons. Because male mor-
tality is generally higher than female mortality, the
probability of women experiencing a transition is
likely to be higher, given their relative longevity.
When morbidity and mortality are examined as dis-
tinct outcomes and the conditional probabilities of
experiencing each are calculated, this gender effect
for transitions may disappear.
As in other research, we found gender to be an
important determinant of risk for death in all but the
oldest persons studied. This study demonstrates
that men are more likely to die than women who are
the same age with the same level of functional limi-
tation. One likely explanation for the disappearance
of this gender effect for mortality has to do with the
increasing and eventually overriding importance of
age. The differential effects of gender on morbidity
and mortality found in this study demonstrate the
need to apply separate models to the study of these
outcomes.
Although popular stereotypes portray aging as a
process involving a decline in physical function fol-
lowed by death, we found numerous exceptions to
this relationship. Indeed, nearly half of the study
sample die having never reported an ADL limitation
at the previous interviews. Among men and women
reporting ADL limitations, we documented a graded
relationship between the number of limitations and
Vol. 36, No. 4,1996 439
the subsequent risk of death, which is higher for men
(except in the oldest age group) and increases with
age, but is not entirely uniform. Yet, even highly
limited men and women have a probability of dying
that is less than 50% until age 90. In addition, average
life expectancy for men with five ADL limitations
ranges from 3.0 to 4.1 years, and for women with five
ADL limitations from 3.0 to 5.9 years. Therefore,
although the probabilities of dying are greater given
high limitation levels, death is not imminent, even
for the highly limited.
Knowledge of the degree and pattern of functional
limitation transitions has important implications for
the provision of health services for older persons and
for the formulation of public policy. This information
may help us to better predict future transitions and
develop strategies to postpone the acquisition of ad-
ditional limitations in community-dwelling older pop-
ulations. These findings also underscore the need to
ensure the provision of services that accommodate
the needs of older persons who differ widely in terms
of functional ability and whose limitation status is
highly dynamic. Finally, this study highlights the need
for further research that examines how medical con-
ditions, health care utilization, and environmental
influences affect limitation status and the transitions
of older persons among levels of limitation.
