Objective: Toexaminethedifferentialassociationsofciga-
rette retail marketing practices on youth smoking uptake.
Design: Analyses from annual, nationally representa-
tive, cross-sectional surveys of 8th, 10th, and 12th grad-
ers in the United States.
Setting: The February 1999 through June 2003 Moni-
toring the Future surveys involved 109 308 students and
data on retail cigarette marketing collected from 966 com-
munities in which the students reside, as part of the Bridg-
ing the Gap Initiative: Research Informing Practice and
Policy for Healthy Youth Behavior.
Participants: A total of 26 301 students were selected
for this study.
Main Exposures: Point-of-sale advertising, promo-
tions, prices, and placement.
Outcome Measure: Using a smoking uptake mea-
sure to account for stages that identify the process by
which adolescents begin smoking, we calculated odds
ratios and confidence intervals through generalized
ordered logit analyses, with weighted data that con-
trolled for demographic and socioeconomic character-
istics and accounted for clustering at the community
level.
Results: Higher levels of advertising, lower cigarette
prices,andgreateravailabilityofcigarettepromotionswere
associated with smoking uptake. Advertising increased
the likelihood of youth initiating smoking, price in-
creased the likelihood of smoking at most levels of up-
take, and availability of promotions increased the like-
lihood that youth will move from experimentation to
regular smoking.
Conclusions: Cigarette retail marketing practices in-
crease the likelihood of smoking uptake. These findings
suggest that specific restrictions on retail cigarette mar-
keting may reduce youth smoking.

CHILDHOOD EXPERIMENTA-
tion with cigarettes and
progression to regular use
remains a public health
concern. Research1 shows
that initiating smoking at a younger age
is associated with eventually smoking more
cigarettes per day than initiating smok-
ing at an older age, suggesting that delay-
ing the onset of smoking may affect the
likelihood of becoming addicted to ciga-
rettes or becoming a heavy smoker. It is
also estimated that adolescents who started
smoking in the mid to late 1990s will
smoke for at least 16 years if male and 20
years if female.2 Thus, smoking will be a
long-term addiction for many current ado-
lescent smokers. Furthermore, youth who
initiate smoking at an early age are at an
increased risk for developing long-term
health consequences.3 Because increas-
ing levels of smoking experience in-
crease the likelihood of future smoking,3
many researchers4-7 have begun to use
stages of smoking experience to predict the
transition to future established smoking.

In this study, we examine the influence of cigarette re-
tail marketing strategies on the progression of adoles-
cents from experimentation to established smoking using
data collected from February 1999 through June 2003 in
nationally representative samples of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-
grade students. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to examine the differential effects of these retail market-
ing strategies on smoking uptake at the national level. The
strengths of this study are that most of the data were col-
lected after the implementation of the MSA provisions,
allowing for an examination of the post-MSA retail ciga-
rette environment; and its ability to simultaneously ex-
amine the impact that objectively collected measures of
the cigarette retail environment have on youth smoking
uptake.
METHODS
YOUTH SMOKING DATA
Cross-sectional data were collected from February 1999 through
June 2003 from 109 308 students in schools participating in
their second year of the Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey,
funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The MTF sur-
vey uses a multistage sampling design to obtain nationally rep-
resentative samples of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students, with
modal ages of 14, 16, and 18 years, respectively.22 Community
boundaries were defined as the area from which each MTF school
drew at least 80% of its student population. Community data
collection activities, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-
dation as part of the Bridging the Gap Initiative: Research In-
forming Practice and Policy for Healthy Youth Behavior, oc-
curred in approximately 200 MTF communities each year
(totaling 966 community areas from 1999 through 2003).
The uptake measure, which is described in detail elsewhere,6
has been validated to show that current smoking status and in-
tentionstosmokearereliablepredictorsoffuturesmoking.Briefly,
this measure includes stages that identify the process by which
adolescents begin smoking. Three MTF questions were used to
create the uptake measure: (1) ever smoking, (2) smoking in the
past 30 days, and (3) intention to smoke in the next 5 years. The
uptake measure included the following categories: (1) never
smoker, (2) puffer, (3) nonrecent experimenter, (4) former es-
tablished smoker, (5) recent experimenter, and (6) current es-
tablished smoker. A puffer was defined as someone who has
smoked once or twice. A nonrecent experimenter was defined as a
student who smoked occasionally, but not in the past 30 days. A
former established smoker was defined as a student who smoked
regularly in the past (not the past 30 days). A recent experimenter
was defined as someone who smoked occasionally, but not regu-
larly, in the past 30 days. A current established smoker was de-
fined as someone who smoked regularly at the time of the sur-
vey, or smoked regularly in the past and smoked in the past 30
days. Because some of the MTF questions used to create this mea-
sure are asked of a subset of students, this study is limited to this
subsample of respondents.
CIGARETTE MARKETING DATA
Observational data collection occurred annually in retail stores
in the communities around the approximately 200 schools par-
ticipatingintheirsecondyearofMTFsurveys.Communitybound-
aries were defined as the area from which each school drew most
of its student population. Using the census TIGER (Topologi-
cally Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system;
a Web mapping application, sponsored by the US Census Bu-
reau, for the United States) files, maps of each community were
created and a list of potential tobacco retailers located within each
community was generated based on retailer-reported standard in-
dustry classification codes. Screener calls were conducted by tele-
phone to identify which of these stores sold tobacco products. If
the total number of outlets selling tobacco in a community was
30 or fewer, all outlets were observed; this was the case in 82.0%
of communities. If more than 30 outlets sold tobacco products, a
random sample of 30 stores was selected, along with a random
sample of replacement stores (for use if a store on the primary
list was closed, was determined to be unsafe, could not be lo-
cated, or did not sell tobacco or alcohol). If the list of retail stores
was fewer than 30 in a given community, field staff were in-
structed to add any additional stores selling tobacco products that
they identified in the field. Field staff also added the store near-
est the index school if it was not included in the sample. There
were 17 476 stores in the 5-year sample, with a mean of 18.1 (SD,
9.9) stores per community.
Observations were conducted in each retail outlet using
trained field staff teams composed of a lead and an assistant
observer. The 2-person teams served as a reliability check for
each site observation. If there was disagreement on any mea-
sure, field staff would return to the store to verify the measure
prior to leaving the community. The purpose of the retail ob-
servations was to unobtrusively collect information on to-
bacco product placement, the extent of related advertising and
promotions, and tobacco prices. Advertising included parking
lot, other exterior (eg, store window), and interior advertis-
ing, while promotions included special price offers, on-pack
coupons, and retail value-added promotions (eg, buy 1 get 1
free or gift with purchase). Observers collected these data dur-
ing an approximately 10-minute visit to each selected store. Field
staff were instructed to alternate collecting information on posted
nominal prices (including excise taxes, but excluding sales tax)
and price-based promotional offers for Marlboro (Philip Mor-
ris USA, Richmond, Va) and Newport (Lorilland Tobacco Com-
pany, Greensboro, NC) cigarettes from store to store to yield
approximately equal numbers of stores for each brand. If a store
did not sell one of the brands, then the other was substituted.
Marlboro and Newport were selected because they are the brands
most widely used by teenagers, accounting for approximately
78% of the usual brand smoked.23 Information was also col-
lected on low-height advertisements (105 cm from the ground)
and functional objects (branded objects that have some use,
such as clocks, trash cans, and grocery baskets).
Two of the cigarette marketing variables are defined as the
proportion of stores in each community that had a given type
of marketing. For example, the promotions variable reflects the
proportion of stores in the community that offered some type
of promotion for Marlboro or Newport. Similarly, the place-
ment variable reflects the proportion of the stores with clerk
assist­only cigarette placement.
For advertising, a scale (Cronbach =0.70) was constructed,
which equals the sum of 5 separate variables representing the
proportion of stores in a site having any (1) property, (2) exte-
rior, (3) interior, (4) functional object, or (5) low-height adver-

tising. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by testing alterna-
tive constructs, including a measure representing the proportion
of stores in a site having increasing levels of advertising. Results
were consistent across measures. Therefore, we present the most
straightforward advertising construct.
The measure of price is the average price of premium-
brand cigarettes (Marlboro and Newport) across all stores in a
community. To account for changes in the relative price of ciga-
rettes over time, our price measure is deflated by the national
Consumer Price Index, published by the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics (2003). Methods for the youth surveys and the commu-
nity data collection were reviewed and approved by an appro-
priate institutional review board.
CONTROL VARIABLES
Key state tobacco control policies were controlled for in the
models. These include an index reflecting the comprehensive-
ness and extent of state restrictions on smoking, adjusted for
preemption; an index of state policies banning minors' pur-
chase, use, or possession of tobacco products; and an index of
state policies restricting youth access to tobacco products. The
smoke-free air index is the sum of restrictions on smoking in
9 different indoor locations, with each taking a value between
0 and 5 depending on the extent of the restriction, with points
subtracted if there is statewide preemption of stronger local poli-
cies. The purchase, use, or possession index includes 3 di-
chotomous variables (1 indicates law present; and 0, no law),
representing the count of state policies prohibiting minors'
possession, use, and purchase, respectively. The youth access
index was constructed using the rating system developed by
Alciati et al,24 and includes information on 9 dimensions of youth
access­related policies rated from 0 to 5 depending on the strin-
gency of relevant provisions. The state-level tobacco-related poli-
cies were obtained from a tobacco database (ImpacTeen; avail-
able at: http://www.impacteen.org).
In addition, several variables were used to control for youth
and community factors likely to affect smoking behavior, in-
cluding grade (8, 10, and 12), sex, race/ethnicity (black or Afri-
can American, white or Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, and other),
lives with both parents, student income from a job or other
sources, indicators of parental educational level (some college
or more), year of data collection, and urbanization of the com-
munity. Urbanization level was obtained from the National Cen-
ter for Education Statistics for each school. Other data are taken
from the MTF surveys. Cases with missing data on any vari-
able were eliminated from analyses.
ANALYSIS
Analyses were run using computer software (Stata, version 9.2;
StataCorp, College Station, Tex). Generalized ordered logit mod-
els were run using gologit25 procedures in the software (Stata),
requesting Wald tests to determine if the coefficients between
thresholds were significantly different for the gologit models and
using the lincom statement for requested contrasts. We used a
generalized ordered logit model to capture the differential ef-
fects of cigarette marketing on our varying thresholds of smok-
ing uptake. A standard ordered logit model, also called a propor-
tionaloddsmodel,assumestheeffectoftheindependentvariables
is the same for all categories of the dependent variable. The gen-
eralized ordered logit model relaxes the proportional odds as-
sumption and allows the effects of the explanatory variables to
have varying effects on different levels of smoking uptake. We
defined 6 levels of smoking uptake; thus, there are 5 thresholds
to separate these stages. The complex sample design was ac-
counted for by using sampling weights to adjust for differential
selection probabilities, and adjusting for clustering by site--
defined as school enrollment zone--to compute robust stan-
dard errors. All analyses controlled for student grade, sex, race/
ethnicity, whether the student lives with both parents, student's
income from work and other sources, father's and mother's level
of education (college or more), urbanization, state-level tobacco
control policies, and year of data collection.

(2.56) of 5 types of advertising. In contrast, only 17.0% of
stores within each community had some type of self-assist
placement, but 48.0%, or nearly half, of all stores had some
type of price-based cigarette promotion. The average price
for premium-brand cigarettes was $3.62.
Table 2 contains the frequency distributions for smok-
ing experience. Overall, 53.7% of the sample had never
smoked. The next most frequent category was puffers
(20.7%); also at the high end, 11.5% of the sample were
current established smokers. The mean for smoking up-
takewas1.23,indicatingthattheaveragestudentwassome-
where between a puffer and a nonrecent experimenter.
Table 3 reports the results of the generalized or-
dered logit model examining movement across the smok-
ing uptake thresholds by retail cigarette marketing strat-
egy. Thresholds 1 through 5 refer to the 6 different levels
of smoking uptake reported in Table 2. For example,
threshold 1 refers to a movement from "never smoker"
to "puffer," and so on. Results for threshold 1 showed
that an increase in moving up a level on the advertising
scale (the proportion of stores in a community having
an additional type of advertising) will increase the odds
of an adolescent moving from the nonsmoking to the ini-
tiation (puffer) stage of uptake by a factor of 1.08, or a
relative increase of 8%. We did test for interaction ef-
fects between grade and advertising (results not shown).
Results showed a significant interaction effect for 8th grad-
ers and advertising. All other results remained un-
changed. Beginning at threshold 2, advertising was no
longer significant; price had a strong significant nega-
tive effect on smoking uptake. In fact, results suggest that
for every dollar increase in price, the odds that an ado-
lescent will move on to the next level of smoking de-
crease by 24%. The magnitude of the effect of higher ciga-
rette prices on smoking uptake varies slightly by threshold;
but overall, this finding was consistent across the re-
maining thresholds (3-5). Beginning at threshold 3, the
presence of promotions had a positive significant effect
on moving youth along the smoking uptake con-
tinuum. Results of thresholds 4 and 5 also showed that
the proportion of stores having any promotions signifi-
cantly increased the odds of youth moving to higher lev-
els of smoking uptake.
The results of the pairwise Wald tests showed signifi-
cant differences in moving from threshold 1 to 2 for price
(P =.03), while the effects of price are equal across the
remaining stages of uptake. For promotions, we found
significant differences in moving from threshold 3 to 5
and from threshold 4 to 5 (P =.05 for both).
To better assess the magnitude of the association be-
tween cigarette marketing and youth smoking uptake,
we conducted a series of simulations to produce esti-
mates of how cigarette marketing influences the differ-
ent thresholds of smoking uptake for varying levels of
availability for advertising and promotions. Specifically,
the predicted probabilities were calculated for the model
estimated in Table 3 by separately setting the advertis-
ing and promotion variables to their minimum and maxi-
mum values found in the sample, holding all other in-
dependent variables at their mean. Simulations were
performed using the prvalue option in the computer soft-
ware used (Stata, version 9.2) to assess the impact of these
various changes in marketing measures on youth smok-
ing uptake.
We used the estimates from our model to predict
changes in uptake if stores went from having approxi-
mately 21/2 different types of advertising to having no ad-
vertising or if stores had all 5 types of advertising. If stores
had no advertising, there would be a relative 11.25% de-
cline in puffers, while increasing the types of advertis-
ing in stores to include the 5 captured in our scale would
result in a 10.86% increase in puffers.
For promotions, we examined changes in smoking up-
take if they went from being available in just less than
half of stores to being available in either all stores (100%)
or no stores. If all stores had some type of promotions,
current established smokers would experience a rela-
tive increase of 16.58%. On the other hand, completely
eliminating promotions would result in a 13.39% rela-
tive decline in current established smokers.
COMMENT
The results of this study show cigarette marketing strat-
egies have differential effects on the progression from ini-
tiation and experimentation with cigarettes to regular
smoking. Specifically, our results suggest point-of-sale
advertising is associated with encouraging youth to try

influencing those youth already experimenting with ciga-
rettes to progress to regular smoking, with established
smokers being most influenced by promotional offers.
The advertising measure used in our study repre-
sents the level or amount of point-of-sale advertising that
is present in communities. This pervasiveness of adver-
tising may influence youth initiation of smoking by cre-
ating the belief that smoking is a normative behavior.3
As previously mentioned, we also tested for interactions
between grade and advertising, which did not substan-
tively alter our results or the implications of this study.
Results did show that 8th graders are more influenced
by advertising than 10th and 12th graders. This rein-
forces our overall finding that advertising impacts the early
stages of smoking, which is where we would expect to
find the younger students.
Our findings are consistent with previous litera-
ture,10,14,26-28 which has shown a link between advertis-
ing and promotions and encouraging adolescents to ini-
tiate smoking. There is also evidence that point-of-sale
advertising influences youths' intentions to smoke in the
future.29 Some studies12,14,15 have also found a relation-
ship between receptivity to tobacco "advertising" and pro-
gressing to established smoking. We did not find any evi-
dence of point-of-sale advertising influencing current
established smokers. However, these studies12,14,15 used
measures that captured youths' receptivity to cigarette
advertisements and tobacco promotional items (ie, a
T-shirt or a hat). This study disentangled these market-
ing strategies to look at point-of-sale advertising and pro-
motions separately. Thus, although our results show ad-
vertising has no influence on established smokers, our
findings are consistent with previous studies given that
our results show promotions are important in the later
stages of uptake.
Furthermore, these findings support previous re-
search30,31 that shows price-based promotional offers are
particularly appealing to young price-sensitive smok-
ers. Thus, the beneficial effects of higher cigarette prices
are undermined when youth are able to take advantage
of cigarette promotions. In addition, our results suggest
higher cigarette prices are associated with discouraging
youth from progressing to established smoking at most
levels of smoking uptake. Price was only insignificant at
threshold 1, possibly because youth who first initiate to-
bacco use are more likely to obtain cigarettes from a source
other than a store.32 This finding is particularly signifi-
cant because the latest Federal Trade Commission Ciga-
rette Report21 shows a substantial increase in price dis-
counts (71.4% or $10.78 billion), such as buy downs, paid
to retailers in 2003 to reduce the price of cigarettes to
consumers. Beginning in 2002, there was a definite shift
away from retail value-added promotions toward price
discounts,21 which would be reflected in the recorded ciga-
rette price rather than through the presence of a promo-
tional offer. This shift toward price discounts is re-
flected in the data used for this study, which can be seen
in Table 4. After steady increases, there was no change
in price between 2002 and 2003, and the largest in-
crease in the presence of promotions occurred in the cat-
egory of cents off/special advertised price.
There are some limitations in our marketing data: (1)
the lack of information on the content of the point-of-sale
advertising, (2) the promotions variable does not capture
the full extent of promotions that may have been available
in the stores during data collection, and (3) our price mea-
sure is an average of prices collected across stores in the
community and is unweighted because we have no infor-
mation regarding each store's share of cigarette sales. Yet,
these measures are still more local and, for promotions and
price, more specific to the brands youth smoke than any-
thing that has been used in previous studies.
Since the implementation of the MSA, the cigarette in-
dustry has shifted its marketing efforts away from more
traditional media, such as print advertising, toward re-
tail marketing efforts.20 Our findings provide evidence
that the retail environment is associated with youth smok-
ing uptake. Therefore, although the MSA restricted the
cigarette industry's advertising and promotional activi-
ties, and the industry itself has restricted its advertising
in magazines, the increase in cigarette retail marketing
is, at least partly, offsetting any benefits of other MSA-
related marketing reductions.
These results are of particular significance because, to
our knowledge, no previous study has examined the dif-
ferential impact of objectively collected measures of ciga-
rette marketing strategies on smoking uptake. Overall, our
results provide evidence that restricting point-of-sale ad-
vertising will discourage youth from trying smoking, and
policies that increase cigarette prices and/or restrict price-

*The promotion measure differs slightly between 1999 and subsequent years. In 1999, the presence of a variety of promotions for any brand was collected;
from 2000 on, the presence of promotions for Marlboro (Philip Morris USA, Richmond, Va) or Newport (Lorilland Tobacco Company, Greensboro, NC) cigarettes
only was collected. This is most likely the cause of the decrease in the presence of promotions from 1999 to 2000.
