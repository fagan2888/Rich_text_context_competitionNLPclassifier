ABSTRACT
Although several studies have noted increased fracture risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the pathophysiologic
mechanisms underlying this association are not known. We hypothesize that insulin resistance (the key pathology in T2DM)
negatively influences bone remodeling and leads to reduced bone strength. Data for this study came from 717 participants in the
Biomarker Project of the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS II). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) was calculated from fasting morning blood glucose and insulin levels. Projected 2D (areal) bone mineral density (BMD) was
measured in the lumbar spine and left hip using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Femoral neck axis length and width were
measured from the hip DXA scans, and combined with BMD and body weight and height to create composite indices of femoral neck
strength relative to load in three different failure modes: compression, bending, and impact. We used multiple linear regressions to
examine the relationship between HOMA-IR and bone strength, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, menopausal transition stage
(in women), and study site. Greater HOMA-IR was associated with lower values of all three composite indices of femoral neck strength
relative to load, but was not associated with BMD in the femoral neck. Every doubling of HOMA-IR was associated with a 0.34 to 0.40
SD decrement in the strength indices (p < 0.001). On their own, higher levels of fasting insulin (but not of glucose) were
independently associated with lower bone strength. Our study confirms that greater insulin resistance is related to lower femoral neck
strength relative to load. Further, we note that hyperinsulinemia, rather than hyperglycemia, underlies this relationship. Although
cross-sectional associations do not prove causality, our findings do suggest that insulin resistance and in particular, hyperinsulinemia,
may negatively affect bone strength relative to load. © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
KEY WORDS: INSULIN RESISTANCE; BONE STRENGTH
Introduction
Osteoporotic fractures represent a significant morbidity and
financial cost burden to individuals and society.(1,2) The
scope of this problem is expected to increase worldwide with
the graying of the population and is likely to be exacerbated by
the rapidly increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) in both developed and developing economies.(3­5)
Indeed, multiple studies have noted the increased fracture risk in
individuals with T2DM.(6­9)
The pathophysiology underlying this increase in fracture risk in
T2DM is not well understood. For instance, low bone mineral
density (BMD) is a major risk factor for fracture, yet BMD in
diabetics is greater than that in nondiabetic individuals.(8,10­12)
But T2DM is also associated with greater body weight, which can
increase fracture risk by several mechanisms, including increas-
ing the forces on bone during a fall.(13­19) Greater body weight is
also expected to increase BMD by the impact of skeletal loading
on osteoblast differentiation and activity.(20,21) However, the
pathophysiology of T2DM may negatively influence bone
formation,(8,9,22,23) so that although BMD is increased in T2DM
in response to increased skeletal loading, it is not increased
enough relative to the increased impact forces in a fall.
Consistent with this hypothesis, composite indices of femoral
neck strength relative to load are indeed lower in midlife women
with diabetes than in nondiabetic women.(24) The composite
strength indices combine femoral neck areal BMD and size
obtained from dual-energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) hip scans
with body size to gauge strength relative to load (impact forces)
as may be borne during a fall.(25) They are inversely associated
with incident hip fracture risk in community-dwelling older white
women(25) and in young U.S. white and Chinese men and
women,(26) and unlike BMD, predict fragility fracture risk in
middle-aged women without requiring knowledge of the
woman's race/ethnicity.(27)
Ishii and colleagues(24) also noted a significant inverse
association between insulin resistance (measured using the
Homeostatic Model of Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]) and
composite indices for bone strength in a multiethnic sample
of premenopausal women. A few small studies have also found

inverse associations between insulin resistance and markers of
bone formation, such as osteocalcin,(28,29) osteoprotegerin,(30)
and even BMD in some subpopulations.(31­33)
We therefore hypothesized that insulin resistance plays a key
role in the increased fracture risk observed in T2DM, and used
data from a national midlife sample to examine the association
between insulin resistance and bone strength. Thus we hope to
extend the results of Ishii and colleagues(24) to a population of
men and women, and uniquely, we used DXA-derived femoral
bone strength relative to load, in addition to BMD, as markers of
bone strength.
Subjects and Methods
Data came from the second wave of the Midlife in the United
States Study (MIDUS II), which included blood and urine assays
for biomarkers and bone scans for a subsample of the overall
MIDUS II cohort. The MIDUS II study, initiated in 1995, was
designed to determine how social, psychological, and behavioral
factors interrelate to influence mental and physical health. The
first wave (MIDUS I) collected sociodemographic and psychoso-
cial data on 7108 English-speaking, noninstitutionalized Ameri-
can adults residing in the contiguous 48 states, ages 25 to
74 years, whose household included at least one telephone
(recruited by random digit dialing), with oversampling of
five metropolitan areas, twin pairs, and siblings.(34) To increase
the representation of African Americans from urban, low
socioeconomic strata in the sample, 592 additional African
American residents were recruited from Milwaukee, WI, USA, to
participate in MIDUS II.
Of the 4963 participants who completed the MIDUS II survey,
3191 participants were deemed medically safe to travel. Of them,
1255 agreed to participate in the MIDUS II biomarker project,
which required a 2-day commitment, including travel to one of
three general clinical research centers (GCRC): the University of
California at Los Angeles, Georgetown University, and the
University of Wisconsin­Madison. Reasons given for nonpartici-
pation were travel, family, and work obligations. MIDUS II
Biomarker Project participants were similar to the MIDUS II
sample with respect to key characteristics (eg, subjective health,
chronic conditions, physical activity, alcohol use),(35) and the
complete MIDUS II sample was similar to the MIDUS I sample.(36)
Data were collected during a 24-hour stay at a GCRC between
July 2004 and May 2009. The protocol included a medical history
and physical examination (including medication review), a
fasting blood draw, and DXA scans of the lumbar spine and
left hip.(35) Height and weight were measured during the GCRC
visit. Blood samples were frozen and shipped to a central
laboratory for assays. The glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and
lipid assays were performed at Meriter Labs (GML) in Madison,
WI, USA using a Cobra Integra Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN, USA). The glucose assays were performed at
ARUP Laboratories in Salt Lake City, UT, USA. Insulin assays were
performed on a Siemens Advia Centaur Analyzer also at ARUP
Laboratories (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Tarrytown,
NY, USA). Informed consent was provided by each participant,
and each MIDUS center obtained institutional review board
approval.(35)
The sample for this analysis included participants in the MIDUS
II Biomarker Project with valid data on bone strength, fasting
insulin, and fasting glucose. Of the 1255 participants in the
MIDUS II Biomarker Project, we excluded data from 347
participants who did not have DXA scans (mainly because
funding for DXA scanning at the UCLA and Georgetown sites was
obtained after the Biomarker Project had commenced), an
additional 15 individuals for whom data for fasting insulin and
glucose data was lacking or fasting insulin values were less
than or equal to 68 mU/mL, 91 participants who were taking
medications known to influence bone strength (oral cortico-
steroids, alendronate, anastrazole, calcitonin, ibandronate,
leuprolide, letrozole, raloxifene, risedronate, tamoxifen, zole-
dronic acid, testosterone, finasteride, or dutasteride), and 85
women whose menopause transition stage could not be
determined, resulting in an analytic sample of 717.
For those models in which insulin resistance, fasting insulin, or
fasting glucose were primary predictors, 83 individuals who were
taking hypoglycemic medications (glimepiride, glipizide, Met-
formin, glyburide, Nateglinide, Pioglitazone, Pramlintide, Repa-
glinide, Rosiglitazone, or Sitagliptin) or insulin analogues
(Humalog, Novalog, Humulin N, Novolin N, Lantus, or Levemir)
were excluded, leaving an analytic sample of size 634 for these
analyses.
Measurements: primary predictors
Details of the sequence and methodology of biological specimen
collection in the MIDUS II Biomarker Project have been described
in detail.(35) Biomarker Project participants also provided
information on health conditions and medication usage.
Medication information was verified by examination of medica-
tion bottles brought to the clinical research center.
Blood HbA1c measurements were obtained from fasting
blood draws in the morning. Blood glucose and insulin levels
measured from fasting morning blood samples were used to
calculate insulin resistance by the HOMA-IR, which is approxi-
mated using the formula below(37):
HOMA-IR ¼ fasting glucose ðin mg=dLÞ
Â fasting insulin ðin mU=mLÞ Â 0:00247
ð1Þ
Participants were said to have diabetes if they met any of the
following four criteria: (1) HbA1c ! 6.5%; (2) fasting glucose !
126 mg/dL; (3) reported having diabetes (categorical answer to
the question "In past 12 months have you experienced or been
treated for any of the following conditions: diabetes or high
blood sugar?"); or (4) were taking medication(s) for diabetes
including insulin analogue agents or hypoglycemic medications
mentioned earlier in the Subjects and Methods section.
Participants were said to have prediabetes if they met all of
the following three criteria: (1) 5.7% HbA1c < 6.5% OR 100 mg/
dL < fasting glucose < 126 mg/dL; (2) did NOT report having
diabetes; AND (3) were NOT taking medication(s) for diabetes.
Participants were deemed to not have either prediabetes or
diabetes if they met all of the following criteria: (1) HbA1c
< 5.7%; (2) fasting glucose 100 mg/dL; (3) did NOT report
having diabetes; AND (4) were NOT taking medication(s) for
diabetes.
Measurements: bone strength
During the GCRC visit, 2D projected (areal) BMD was measured in
the lumbar spine (L1
­L4
) and left hip using DXA. DXA scans were
performed using GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy (Madison site) or
Hologic 4500 (UCLA and Georgetown sites) technology.
Reading of all DXA scans was performed centrally by
physicians at the University of Wisconsin DXA center. Three

times per week, and on all days on which scans were obtained,
instruments were calibrated and phantom scan data were
acquired. No densitometer shift or drift occurred during
the course of this study. For BMD cross-calibration across the
three clinical sites, a phantom was scanned 10 times on the
densitometers at each of the three study sites. The linear
regression equation developed from these calibration scans was
used to correct BMD values from two of the three sites to make
the data comparable across study sites. The recalibrated BMD
values at the lumbar spine and left hip were reported in units of
grams per square centimeters(g/cm2).(38)
Femoral neck axis length (FNAL), the distance along the
femoral neck axis from the lateral margin of the base of the
greater trochanter to the apex of the femoral head, and femoral
neck width (FNW), the smallest thickness of the femoral neck
along any line perpendicular to the femoral neck axis, were
measured from the hip scans using software provided by the
scanner manufacturers. Composite indices of femoral neck
strength relative to load were created using the following
formulas(25):
Compression strength index ðCSIÞ
¼ ðBMD Â FNWÞ=Weight
ð2Þ
Bending strength index ðBSIÞ
¼ ðBMD Â FNW2Þ=ðFNAL Â WeightÞ
ð3Þ
Impact strength index ðISIÞ
¼ ðBMD Â FNW Â FNALÞ=ðHeight Â WeightÞ
ð4Þ
All three indices were recorded in units of grams per kilogram
per meter (g/kg-m). Because BMD was measured in grams per
square centimeter, FNW and FNAL in centimeters, weight in
kilograms, and height in meters, we scaled CSI and BSI by 100 to
obtain values in units of grams per kilogram per meter (g/kg-m).
CSI reflects the ability of the femoral neck to withstand an axial
compressive load, BSI reflects its ability to withstand bending
forces, and ISI reflects the ability of the femoral neck to absorb
the potential energy in a fall from standing height.
Measurements: covariates
Information regarding age and gender was obtained from self-
reports. Gender/race/ethnicity was self-identified as white, Black/
African American, other, or multiracial. From self-reported
menstrual patterns and use (in the last year) of sex steroid
hormones (from self-report and examination of medication
bottles brought to the clinical research center), we classified each
female participant's menopause transition stage as one of the
following: premenopausal (no change in regularity of menses),
early perimenopausal (had menses in last 3 months with change
in regularity of menses), late perimenopausal (last menses 3­
12 months previously with change in regularity of menses),
postmenopausal (no menses in prior 12 months) not taking
menopausal hormone therapy, and postmenopausal taking
menopausal hormone therapy.(39)
Men were categorized by age into three categories: younger
than 50 years, 50 to 59 years, and 60 years or older. The choice of
age categories in men was guided by previous observations that
substantial age-related bone loss in men does not start until age
50 years.(40) Further, the age categories chosen in men also
age-matched the oldest group of men to the postmenopausal
women, because only 0.3% of occurrences of spontaneous
menopause take place at or after 59 years of age.(41)
Statistical analyses
We used multiple linear regression to examine the associations of
HOMA-IR (which was log-transformed to reduce skew in the
distribution, using base 2 log transformation to facilitate
interpretation), prediabetes, and diabetes with bone strength
measures, adjusted for age, gender, menopause transition stage,
race (black versus non-black), and study site. We treated log-
transformed HOMA-IR as a continuous predictor because the
relationship between log HOMA-IR and bone strength indices
has been noted to be linear.(24) To allow for age-related changes
in bone strength being different in men and in women, we used
gender-specific coding for age. We included the categorical age
variable for men (<50 years, 50­59 years, !60 years) as well as
two continuous variables--one that tracked age in men 60 years
and older, and another that tracked age in women who were late
perimenopausal or postmenopausal and not taking menopausal
hormone therapy.
Bone strength measures examined as dependent variables
were BMD in the lumbar spine; BMD in the femoral neck; and the
three composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to load:
CSI, BSI, and ISI. Because increased body weight is associated
with insulin resistance and because body weight also influences
bone deposition, the models were run with and without
adjustment for body mass index (BMI). BMI was calculated as
weight (kilograms) divided by the square of height (meters), and
was included in the models as a three different terms: continuous
(linear) term, a squared term (BMI2), and a race interaction
term (BMI Â race) to allow for potentially different effects of BMI
by race.
We tested for effect modification by gender, by including
interactions between gender and the primary predictor(s).
Further, as the relationship between HOMA-IR and bone strength
may be different in prediabetics and diabetics compared
to nondiabetics, we included interaction terms HOMAIR Â
prediabetes and HOMAIR Â diabetes to test for effect modifica-
tion by diabetes and prediabetes statuses. In supplementary
analyses aimed at shedding light on the independent
roles of insulinemia and glycemia, fasting serum insulin
(base 2 log transformed) and fasting serum glucose (base 2
log transformed) were included together in the models in place
of HOMA-IR.
All models accounted for within-family correlations using
STATA's cluster option. STATA SE version 10.1 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX, USA) was used for all analyses.
Results
The study sample was similar to the complete MIDUS II Biomarker
Project sample with respect to age, BMI, HOMA-IR, prediabetes,
and diabetes prevalence (Table 1). The most common reasons for
exclusion of Biomarker Project participants from the analysis
sample were missing hip DXA scans (from the UCLA and
Georgetown sites where DXA scans were added late to the
protocol due to funding limitations) and unclassifiable meno-
pause transition stage in women. Therefore, compared to the
Biomarker sample, the study sample had a smaller proportion of
women and a larger proportion of African Americans (because
the new urban African American participants from Milwaukee
798 SRIKANTHAN ET AL. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research
were seen at the University of Wisconsin­Madison site, which
collected DXA scans from the start of the Biomarker Project)
(Table 1).
The average age of study participants was 56.8 years, 38% of
men were 60 years or older and 59% of women were either late
perimenopausal or postmenopausal and not taking menopausal
hormone therapy. The mean age (SD) of men in the analytic
sample was 56.53 (11.24) years and that of women was 57.12
(11.38) years.
Further, 54.4% of participants had prediabetes and 19.7% of
participants had diabetes. Both prediabetes and overt diabetes
were more common in older individuals and in African American
participants: among diabetics, mean age was 59.5 years, 44.4%
were men, and 34.7% were African American; among predia-
betics, mean age was 57.7 years, 41.8% were men, and 15.5%
were African American; and among those who did not have
either prediabetes or overt diabetes, mean age 52.9 years, 45.3%
were men, and 9.2% were African American.
In the complete sample, median and interquartile range of
HOMA-IR was 2.47 (1.47­4.40), of fasting insulin was 10.0 (6.00­
17.0) mIU/mL, of fasting glucose was 96 (90­105) mg/dL, and of
HbA1c was 5.86 (5.60­6.24) %.
Adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, menopause transition
stage, and study site, greater insulin resistance was associated
with higher BMD in the femoral neck but with lower values of
each of the three composite indices of femoral neck strength
relative to load (Table 2). With additional adjustment for BMI,
greater insulin resistance was associated with lower values of all
five bone strength measures, although the association with
lower BMD in the femoral neck was not significant (Table 2).
Every doubling of HOMA-IR was associated with a 0.09 to 0.14 SD
decrement in the other four bone strength measures (Table 2).

Adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, menopause transition
stage, and study site, prevalent diabetes (but not prevalent
prediabetes) was associated with lower composite indices of
femoral neck strength relative to load, but neither diabetes nor
prediabetes were significantly associated with BMD in either the
femoral neck or lumbar spine (Table 3). Following additional
adjustment for BMI, neither prediabetes nor overt diabetes was
significantly associated with any of the five strength measures
(Table 3).
Gender did not modify the associations of HOMA-IR, with bone
strength (all p values in tests of gender by HOMAIR interaction
were greater than 0.24). Moreover, prediabetes and diabetes
status did not modify the association of HOMA-IR with four of the
five bone strength measures (all but one of the 10 p values in
tests of prediabetes/diabetes by HOMA IR interaction were
greater than 0.17). The one exception was a significant
interaction between prediabetes and HOMA-IR in the association
with lumbar spine BMD (interaction p value 0.05). Therefore, we
re-ran the HOMA-IR and lumbar spine BMD model with the
analytic sample restricted to prediabetics. Among prediabetics,
the association was even stronger: adjusted for age, gender,
race/ethnicity, menopause transition stage, study site, and BMI,
every doubling of HOMA-IR was associated with a 0.15 SD
decrement in lumbar spine BMD (p ¼ 0.01); 95% confidence
interval (À0.27 to À0.03).
Finally, when fasting insulin and fasting glucose were entered
together into the models, higher insulin (but not glucose) was
independently associated with lower bone strength. Adjusted for
age, gender, race/ethnicity, menopause transition stage, study
site, BMI, and fasting glucose, every doubling of fasting insulin
was associated with a 0.10 to 0.18 SD decrement in each of the
five bone strength measures (Table 4).
Discussion
As hypothesized, in this national sample, increased insulin
resistance, prediabetes, and overt diabetes mellitus were all
cross-sectionally associated with lower indices of femoral neck
strength relative to load. Adjustment for BMI also unmasked an
association between greater insulin resistance and lower BMD in
the lumbar spine. Our study confirms and extends the findings of
an inverse association between bone strength indices and insulin
resistance, noted by Ishii and colleagues(24) in premenopausal
women to a national sample, in a population with a wider age

range that includes both men and women. Our findings are also
consistent with those from smaller studies in adolescents,(42)
young adults,(33) bone marrow transplant patients,(32) and
diabetics(31) that have found associations between greater
insulin resistance and lower BMD. These findings and ours
help explain, at least partly, the increased fracture risk observed
in T2DM.(6­9,43)
These findings are in contradistinction to several previous
studies that have documented higher BMD in T2DM(44­46)
despite the increased risk of fractures in T2DM.(6,8,10,12,43,47,48) Our
study however, suggests that hyperinsulinemia itself may in fact,
be associated with lower bone strength, because fasting insulin
levels (and not fasting glucose levels) were associated negatively
with both BMD and composite indices of strength relative to load
in the femoral neck. A deleterious role for insulin on bone is also
consistent with experiments in mouse models that suggest that
osteoblasts are insulin target cells(49) and that insulin signaling in
osteoblasts favors bone resorption. Mice deficient in osteoblast-
specific insulin receptors have reduced expression of genes
implicated in bone resorption (CathepsinK and Tcirg1), less
acidification of bone extracellular matrix, significantly smaller
resorption pits, and markedly lower serum levels of bone
resorption marker, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX).(50) Further, it
was recently noted that in Wistar rats with an obese, insulin-
resistant condition induced by a 12-week high-fat diet, there was
significant impairment of osteoblastic insulin signaling and
osteoblast proliferation, with increased osteoblastic apoptosis
culminating in osteoporosis in the jaw bone, compared to
baseline, measured using micro­computed tomography (mCT) of
mandibular bone.(51)
This study also adds to the accumulating evidence that it is not
enough to look at BMD in isolation when assessing bone's ability
to resist fracture. The importance of bone size and body size to
fracture risk has been established.(47,52­56) The composite indices
of femoral neck strength relative to load combine BMD with both
bone size and body load and improve fracture prediction ability
in both women(25,27) and men.(26) Previous studies have also
noted the lower spine bone volume in T2DM subjects.(57) A
recent study found that bone cross-sectional area is also lower in
T2DM,(58) suggesting a deficit in periosteal apposition which is
normally stimulated by skeletal loading. Other studies have
found that although BMD may be higher in T2DM, bone strength
relative to load is not any higher.(24,59) Taken together, these
studies suggest that increased insulin resistance and/or hyper-
insulinemia may interfere with the usual anabolic response in
bone to skeletal loading, so that bone strength relative to load is
negatively affected.
Our study has some important limitations. Foremost, it is a
cross-sectional study; thus causal inferences cannot be conclu-
sively drawn. We cannot for instance, infer that insulin resistance
leads to low bone strength. An alternate explanation for our
findings might be that increased bone mass leads to greater
insulin sensitivity, because osteoblasts and osteocalcin appear to
have a role in pancreatic function and glucose metabolism.(33,60­
62) Further longitudinal studies of the temporal relationships
between changes in insulin resistance and changes in bone
strength are needed. Next, the composite indices of femoral neck
strength are based on macroscopic measurements from DXA
scans, and ignore changes in microarchitecture and quality of
mineralization, both of which are thought to be adversely
affected by T2DM.(63,64) Finally, previous studies have validated
femoral neck strength indices measured from Hologic machine
scans; this is the first time Lunar machine­based measurements
of the strength indices have been examined in a research study.
Despite these limitations, our study confirms the negative
association between insulin resistance and femoral neck
strength that was first noted in the Study of Women and the
Menopausal Transition (SWAN) cohort of women by Ishii and
colleagues.(24) It suggests that obesity and hyperinsulinemia may
not be bone-protective, and adds to the growing body of
evidence which points to the importance of measuring bone
strength relative to load, in assessing and understanding fracture
risk. Further research is needed to uncover the biological
mechanisms by which insulin resistance could deleteriously
affect bone health.
