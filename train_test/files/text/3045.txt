DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS ARE
highly prevalent in the
United States.1,2 Results from
2 large community-based
mental health surveys, the National In-
stitute of Mental Health Epidemio-
logic Catchment Area (ECA) survey
(1980-1982) and the National Comor-
bidity Survey (NCS) (1990-1992), sug-
gest that the 1-year prevalence of ma-
jor depression in the adult population
is between 5.0%1 and 10.3%.2 Cross-
national epidemiologic research fur-
ther suggests that major depression is
common in Europe, Canada, New Zeal-
and, and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan and
Korea.3
Depressive disorders often impair so-
cial, occupational, and role func-
tions.4-6 The detrimental effects of de-
pression on quality of life and daily
function match those of heart disease
and exceed those of diabetes, arthritis,
and peptic ulcer disease.7 According to
the Global Burden of Disease Study,8
unipolar major depression is the fourth
leading cause of worldwide disability
and is expected to become the second
leading cause by 2020.
Controlled clinical trials demon-
strate that antidepressants and some
psychotherapies significantly reduce the
symptoms of depression.9-11 Antide-
pressant medications are clinically ef-
fective across the full range of severity
of major depressive disorders.12,13 In ad-
dition, specific forms of time-limited
psychotherapy are as effective as anti-
depressants for mild to moderate de-
pressions.13,14
Most individuals with depression re-
ceive no treatment for their symp-
toms.1,15,16 According to a recent re-
port of the surgeon general, promoting
treatment for people with depression is
an even more significant problem than
developing more effective treat-
ments.17 In comparison to the exten-
sive literature on the efficacy of psy-
chotherapy and pharmacologic
treatments, remarkably little is known
about access to treatment for depres-
sion and the treatment experiences of
those who gain access. The late 1980s

Context Recent advances in pharmacotherapy and changing health care environ-
ments have focused increased attention on trends in outpatient treatment of depression.
Objective To compare trends in outpatient treatment of depressive disorders in the
United States in 1987 and 1997.
Design and Setting Analysis of service utilization data from 2 nationally represen-
tative surveys of the US general population, the 1987 National Medical Expenditure
Survey (N=34459) and the 1997 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (N=32636).
Participants Respondents who reported making 1 or more outpatient visits for treat-
ment of depression during that calendar year.
Main Outcome Measures Rate of treatment, psychotropic medication use, psy-
chotherapy, number of outpatient treatment visits, type of health care professional,
and source of payment.
Results The rate of outpatient treatment for depression increased from 0.73 per 100
persons in 1987 to 2.33 in 1997 (P.001). The proportion of treated individuals who
used antidepressant medications increased from 37.3% to 74.5% (P.001), whereas
the proportion who received psychotherapy declined (71.1% vs 60.2%, P=.006). The
mean number of depression treatment visits per user declined from 12.6 to 8.7 per
year (P=.05). An increasingly large proportion of patients were treated by physicians
for their condition (68.9% vs 87.3%, P.001), and treatment costs were more often
covered by third-party payers (39.3% to 55.2%, P.001).
Conclusions Between 1987 and 1997, there was a marked increase in the proportion
of the population who received outpatient treatment for depression. Treatment be-
came characterized by greater involvement of physicians, greater use of psychotropic
medications, and expanding availability of third-party payment, but fewer outpatient
visits and less use of psychotherapy. These changes coincided with the advent of better-
tolerated antidepressants, increased penetration of managed care, and the develop-
ment of rapid and efficient procedures for diagnosing depression in clinical practice.

and first half of the 1990s was a period
of significant change in the delivery of
mental health services, including the
growth of managed care and the devel-
opment of selective serotonin reup-
take inhibitor (SSRI) medications.
Given these changes, there is a dearth
of information regarding changes over
time in characteristics of persons treated
for depression.
In this article, we examine national
trends in the care of outpatients with
depression using data from the 1987
National Medical Expenditure Survey
(NMES) and the 1997 Medical Expen-
diture Panel Survey (MEPS). These sur-
veys provide large, nationally repre-
sentative samples and use methods that
permit comparisons to be made across
the 2 points in time.
METHODS
Sources of Data
Data were drawn from the household

tionalizedpopulationandweredesigned

mates to be compared over time.
Study Samples
The 1987 NMES used a sampling de-
sign in which 15590 households were
selected from within 165 geographic re-
gions across the United States. A sample
of 34459 individuals was included in
the study, representing a response rate
of 80.1%. The 1997 MEPS household
component was drawn from a nation-
ally representative subsample of the
1995 National Health Interview Sur-
vey, which used a sampling design simi-
lar to that of the 1987 NMES. A sample
of 32636 participants from 14147
households was interviewed. This rep-
resents a 74.1% response rate. For both
surveys, a designated informant was
queried about all related persons who
lived in the household.

ods are presented elsewhere.19,20
Structure of Survey
Households selected for the 1987 NMES
household survey were interviewed 4
timestoobtainhealthcareutilizationin-
formation for the 1987 calendar year.18
The 1997 MEPS included a series of 3
in-person interviews for 1997.19 In both
surveys, respondents were asked to re-
cord medical events as they occurred in
a calendar or diary, which was re-
viewed in-person during each inter-
view. Written permission was obtained
from survey participants to contact
medical practitioners they or house-
hold members reported seeing during
the survey period to verify service use,
medications, charges, and sources and
amounts of payment. Verification pro-
cedures were implemented for all phar-
macypurchases,healthmaintenanceor-
ganizationvisits,andoutpatienthospital
visits and for half of office-based visits.
Visits for Depression
Respondents were asked the reason for
every outpatient visit during the refer-
ence period. Conditions were recorded
byinterviewersasverbatimtextandthen
subsequentlycodedbyprofessionalcod-
ers according to the International Clas-
sificationofDiseases,NinthRevision(ICD-
9), as revised for the National Health
InterviewSurvey.21 Interviewerseachun-
derwent 80 hours of training, and cod-
ers all had degrees in nursing or medi-
cal record administration. A total of 5%
of records were rechecked for errors; er-
ror rates in these rechecks were less than
2.5%. A staff psychiatric nurse estab-
lishedmentaldisorderdiagnosesincases

Respondents who made 1 or more out-
patient visits coded for the purpose of
major depressive disorder, single epi-
sode (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

IV]/ICD-9 code 296.2); major depres-
sive disorder, recurrent (DSM-IV/
ICD-9 code 296.3); dysthymic disorder
(DSM-IV/ICD-9 code 300.4); or depres-
sive disorder, not otherwise specified
(DSM-IV/ICD-9 code 311) were de-
finedashavingreceivedtreatmentforde-
pression.
Health Care Practitioners
TheMEPSandNMESbookletssolicitin-
formation on the type of health care pro-
fessionals providing treatment at each
visit. We classified health care profes-
sionals into the following groups: phy-
sicians of all specialties (a breakdown by
physician specialty was not available for
1997),socialworkers,psychologists,and
a residual group of other providers that
included nurses, nurse practitioners,
physician assistants, chiropractors, and
other health care practitioners.
Psychotherapy
The NMES and MEPS asked respon-
dents the type of care provided during
each outpatient visit using a flash card
with various response categories. Vis-
its that included a specific indication
that "psychotherapy/mental health
counseling" was provided are consid-
ered psychotherapy visits.
Medications
The NMES and MEPS asked for all pre-
scribed medicines associated with each
health care visit. Respondents were
asked to supply the names of any pre-
scribed medications purchased or oth-
erwise obtained, the first and last dates
taken, the number of times obtained,
and the conditions associated with each
medicine. We focus on prescribed psy-
chotropic medications associated with
visits for the treatment of depression.
Psychotropic medications were classi-
fied as antidepressants, anxiolytics, an-
tipsychotics, mood stabilizers, or stimu-
lants according to the 1997 Physicians'
Desk Reference.22 A subcategory of an-
tidepressants was created for SSRIs that
included fluoxetine hydrochloride, ser-
traline hydrochloride, paroxetine, and

fluvoxamine maleate. A subcategory of
newer antipsychotics included cloza-
pine, olanzapine, and risperidone.
Analysis Plan
Rates of treatment for depression per
100 persons for each survey year were
computed stratified by sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. We then exam-
ined sociodemographic characteris-
tics of respondents who reported 1 or
more health care visits for depression
in either survey. The 2 test was used
to examine the strength of association
between rates of treatment of depres-
sion within sociodemographic catego-
ries and across survey years. Wald F
tests were used to identify differences
in means of continuous variables be-
tween the 2 survey years. An examina-
tion was also made of treatment char-
acteristics of individuals ("patients")
who reported receiving treatment for
depression in each survey year.
Weusedalogisticregressionmodelto
evaluate the association between sur-
vey year and psychotropic medication
prescription.Toadjustforchangesinpa-
tient characteristics between the survey
years, we controlled for respondent age,
sex, race, marital status, education, em-
ployment status, and insurance status.
Logisticregressionmodelswerealsoused
to estimate the effect of survey year on
rate of psychotherapy, antidepressant
medication,andthecombinationofpsy-
chotherapyandmedicationtreatment.A
multiple linear regression model was
used to evaluate the association be-
tween survey year and number of psy-
chotherapyvisits,controllingforthevari-
ous sociodemographic covariates. All
statistical analyses were performed us-
ing the SUDAAN software package23 to
accommodate the complex sample de-
sign and the weighting of observations.
The  value was set at .05 and all tests
were 2-sided.
RESULTS
Rate of Treatment
Between 1987 and 1997, there was a sig-
nificant increase in the overall rate of
outpatient treatment of depression. The
rate of treatment increased from 0.73
per 100 persons in 1987 to 2.33 in 1997
(TABLE 1). In contrast, there was little
change during the study period in the
rate within the general population of
persons who received any outpatient
general medical treatment (74.1% in
1987 and 72.4% in 1997).
Sociodemographic Groups
and Characteristics
A significant increase in the rate of out-
patienttreatmentofdepressionoccurred
across all sociodemographic groups
examined. As a proportion of the base-
linerateoftreatment,Hispanicandblack
persons experienced slightly larger
increases than white persons (Table 1).
However, the rate of outpatient treat-
mentforHispanicsandblacksremained
well below the rate of whites. The high-
est rates of treatment were for divorced,
separated,orwidowedindividuals,those
withatleastahighschooleducation,and
unemployed persons (Table 1).
In both survey years, most patients
who received outpatient treatment for
depression were between 18 and 64
years of age, white, female, employed,
and privately insured. Slightly less than
half were married or had more than a
high school education (TABLE 2).
Insurance
There was a significant increase in the
rate of outpatient treatment for depres-
sionregardlessofinsurancestatus.How-
ever, the rate of treatment among indi-
viduals without insurance remained
below that of individuals with either pri-
vate or public insurance (Table 1).

Pharmacologic Treatment
The proportion of individuals treated
for depression who received a pre-
scribed psychotropic medication in-
creased from 44.6% in 1987 to 79.4%
in 1997 (TABLE 3). After controlling for
the possible confounding effects of so-
ciodemographic characteristics, indi-
viduals treated for depression were 4.5
times more likely to be treated with a
psychotropic medication in 1997 than
in 1987 (TABLE 4). During this pe-
riod, the proportion of pharmacy costs
paid by third-party payers increased
from 39.3% to 55.2% (Table 3).
Antidepressants were the most com-
monly prescribed medications for the
treatment of depression. After adjust-
ing for confounding sociodemographic
factors, patients treated for depression
were 4.8 times more likely to receive an
antidepressant in 1997 than in 1987
(Table 4). The increase in antidepres-
santusewasprimarilyattributabletoSS-
RIs, a class of antidepressant medica-
tion that was unavailable in 1987.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
were prescribed to more than half
(58.3%)ofindividualswhoreceivedout-
patienttreatmentfordepressionin1997.
Anxiolytics were the second most
commonly prescribed class of psycho-
tropic medication in both survey years,
but were prescribed to fewer than 1 in
7 patients treated for depression. Anx-
iolytics were followed by mood stabi-
lizers and antipsychotics. Stimulants
were rarely prescribed (Table 3).
Psychotherapy
With the increase in rate of outpatient
treatment for depression, there was a
correspondingincreaseintherateofpsy-
chotherapy for depression. However,
among persons treated for depression,
the percentage who received psycho-
therapy declined from 71.1% (1987) to
60.2% (1997) (Table 3). Among those
who received psychotherapy, the mean
annual number of psychotherapy visits
declined from 12.6 visits in 1987 to 8.7
visitsin1997.Thisdeclineremainedsta-
tistically significant after controlling for
the effects of patient sociodemo-
graphic characteristics (Table 4). Dur-
ing this period, there was an increase in
the proportion of psychotherapy costs
borne by third-party payers (Table 3).
Combined Treatment
Theproportionofpatientstreatedforde-
pression who received at least 1 psycho-
therapyvisitalongwithaprescriptionfor
a psychotropic medication increased
from 28.8% in 1987 to 48.1% in 1997.
The comparable proportions who re-
ceived at least 1 psychotherapy visit and
aprescriptionforanantidepressantwere
23.2% in 1987 and 45.2% in 1997.
Treated patients in 1997 were almost
twice as likely to receive psychotherapy
andapsychotropicmedicationthanthey
were in 1987 after controlling for con-
founding sociodemographic factors
(odds ratio, 2.0) (Table 4). They were
also 2.4 times more likely to receive psy-
chotherapy and an antidepressant medi-
cation.
Provider Type
Duringthestudyperiod,therewasasig-
nificant increase in the proportion of
patients whose treatment of depression
involved visits to a physician (Table 3).
By 1997, more than 8 (87.3%) of 10
patients who received outpatient treat-
mentofdepressionweretreatedbyaphy-
sician compared with 68.9% in 1987.
Conversely,thepercentagewhoreceived
treatment from psychologists declined
(29.8% vs 19.1%). Treatment of depres-
sion by social workers remained little
changed and relatively uncommon.

ber of Americans who received treat-

ment for depression during the past de-
cade,andatthesametimethetreatments
they received underwent a profound
transformation. Antidepressant medica-
tions became established as a mainstay,
psychotherapysessionsbecamelesscom-
mon and fewer among those receiving
treatment, and physicians assumed a
moreprominentrole.Thesechangessug-
gest that access to mental health ser-
vices has increased and that there has
been an increased emphasis on pharma-
cologic treatments.
Several factors may have contributed
to these trends. Beginning with the in-
troduction of fluoxetine in late 1987 and
followed by several other SSRIs and an-
tidepressants with atypical mecha-
nisms of action, there has been a steady
broadening of the pharmacologic op-
tions available to treat depression. The
new medications tend to have fewer ad-
verse effects,24,25 require less compli-
cateddosingregimens,andposelessdan-
ger when taken in overdose than the
oldertricyclicantidepressants.Thecom-
parativesafetyandeaseofprescribingSS-
RIs and the other newer antidepres-
sants may have led physicians to lower
thesymptomseveritythresholdatwhich
they decide to prescribe an antidepres-
sant.26 If the availability of the newer
medications tipped the balance in favor
of diagnosing and treating depression,
this would help explain both the in-
creaseintheoverallrateoftreatmentand
the increase in the proportion of treated
cases who filled prescriptions for anti-
depressant medications.
The pharmaceutical industry also en-
gaged in a concerted effort to promote
the increased sale of these new antide-
pressant medications through vigorous
advertising campaigns directed at phy-
sicians, other health care professionals,
and more recently the general pub-
lic.27,28 In addition, medications to treat
depression have been a featured topic of
lead articles in national news maga-
zines, best-selling books, and widely
watched television talk shows. A new
generation of screening and diagnostic
instruments, developed through part-
nerships between industry and aca-
demia, has also become available to fa-
cilitate the rapid and efficient detection
of depression in routine practice.29-31
Beginning in late 1987, the federal
government embarked on a public
health campaign to educate the public
and the medical community about the
recognition and treatment of depres-
sion.32 In 1991, the National Depres-
sion Screening Day program was inau-
gurated to increase awareness and
treatment of depression. By 1997, there
were more than 2800 screening sites in
the 50 states and Canada.33 These cam-
paigns have underscored the impor-
tance of pharmacologic treatments. In
addition, there have been institutional
efforts to improve the diagnosis of de-
pression and influence physician pre-
scribing practices through the publi-
cation of treatment guidelines.12,13
As a result of these developments, the
public may have become more accept-

ing of pharmacologic treatment of de-
pression. According to a 1986 Roper
poll,34 only 12% of respondents indi-
cated that they would be willing to take
medicationfordepression,whereas78%
stated they would live with the depres-
sion until it passed. An ABC News poll35
conductedinApril2000foundthat28%
of adults would be willing to take an-
tidepressants for depression for an ex-
tended period even though they were
informed that safety studies had not
been conducted on long-term use of
these medications. This suggests that
the pharmacologic treatment of depres-
sion is becoming less stigmatized.
The growth in managed mental
health care and the concepts of dis-
ease management36 and medical neces-
sity37 may have further spurred the
pharmacologic treatment of depres-
sion. In many plans, comprehensive
pharmacy benefits encourage medica-
tion management visits over psycho-
therapy visits, which are not reim-
bursed as generously. Managed care
generally seeks to shift patient care from
specialty to primary care physicians
who are able and may be more likely
to use pharmacologic treatments rather
than psychotherapy to manage depres-
sion. In addition, mental disorders that
require ongoing treatment are increas-
ingly managed in behavioral health care
"carve outs" that seek to reduce costs
by lowering the number of visits per de-
pressed individual.38,39
The comparatively low rate of treat-
ment among black and Hispanic indi-
viduals, those with less education, and
those without health insurance sug-
gests that an unmet need for treatment
may be especially great within these
groups.Epidemiologicdataindicatethat
the rate of major depression is in-
versely related to income and educa-
tional achievement and that depres-
sion is more common among Hispanics
than whites or blacks.1,40 These find-
ings suggest, but cannot confirm, that
individualswithintheseminoritygroups
are vulnerable to undertreatment.
According to the NCS (1990-1992),
3.1% of adults 15 to 54 years of age re-
ceived outpatient health care treat-
mentin1yearforamooddisorder.15 The
earlier ECA (1980-1982) survey re-
ported that 3.6% of adults have an af-
fective disorder and receive mental
health treatment in the health system
during 1 year.1 These NCS and ECA
findings exceed the corresponding find-
ingsfromtheNMES(1987)(0.7%).This
disparity may be related to important
methodologic differences between the
studies. For example, although the ECA
figures include treatment for any men-
tal health or addictive symptoms by
adults who meet criteria for an affec-
tive disorder, the NMES figures in-
clude only outpatient treatment re-
ported for depression. Methodologic
differences between the studies stem
from underlying differences in their pri-
mary aims: to quantify psychopathol-
ogy in the community (ECA and NCS)
and to measure service use over time
(NMES and MEPS).
One consequence of increased phar-
macologictreatmentofdepressionisthat
larger numbers of depressed individu-
als are being treated with both pharma-
cotherapyandpsychotherapy.Recentre-
search suggests that the combination of
an antidepressant and cognitive behav-
ioral psychotherapy is more efficacious
than either treatment alone for chronic
forms of major depression.41 In milder
depressions, psychotherapy alone may
be nearly as effective as the combina-
tion of antidepressants and psycho-
therapy.42 The extent to which com-
bined treatments confer meaningful
advantages over single-modality treat-
ments in clinical practice awaits de-
tailed longitudinal practice-based out-
comes research.
The current study is constrained by
several limitations. Both the NMES and
MEPS collect data from household in-
formants who may not be fully aware of
all of the services used by household
members. Stigma, recall problems, and
problems distinguishing the different
provider groups pose threats to the re-
porting and classification of the survey
data.Somerespondents,especiallythose
with less education, may not be able to
identify "psychotherapy/mental health
counseling" when they receive it. With-
out an independent measure of symp-
toms, it is not possible to determine
whether patients who received treat-
ment actually met diagnostic criteria for
theselectedconditions.Finally,the1997
survey did not break out providers by
physician specialty, thereby limiting our
ability to determine whether the ob-
served changes in treatment patterns oc-
curred primarily in the general medical
or specialty mental health sector.
In recent years, a growing number of
Americans have received treatment for
depression. During this period, anti-
depressant medications have gained
popularity and physicians have ex-
tended their involvement in care. For
the promise of increased access to treat-
ment to be fully realized, available treat-
ments must be provided in a safe,
timely, and effective manner. An im-
portant challenge ahead is to charac-
terize the community treatment of de-
pression with greater specificity and
relate variations in these treatments to
critical patient outcomes.
