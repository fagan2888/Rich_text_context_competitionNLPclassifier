alcohol outlet density predict incidence, severity,
and outcome of hospitalization for traumatic
injury? A cross-sectional study of Dallas County,
Texas, 2010

Abstract
Background: Unintentional injury leads all other causes of death for those 1 to 45 years old. The expense of
medical care for injured people is estimated to exceed $406 billion annually. Given this burden on the population,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consistently refers to injury prevention as a national priority. We
postulated that exposure to crime and the density of alcohol outlets in one's neighborhood will be positively
associated with the incidence of hospitalization for and mortality from traumatic injuries, independent of other
neighborhood characteristics.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with ecological and individual analyses. Patient-level data for traumatic
injury, injury severity, and hospital mortality due to traumatic injury in 2010 were gathered from the Dallas-Fort Worth
Hospital Council Foundation. Each case of traumatic injury or death was geospatially linked with neighborhood of
origin information from the 2010 U.S. Census within Dallas County, Texas. This information was subsequently linked
with crime data gathered from 20 local police departments and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission alcohol
outlet dataset. The crime data are the Part One crimes reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Results: The proportion of persons 65 years old or older was the strongest predictor of the incidence of hospitalization
for traumatic injury (b = 12.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.73 to 16.55). In turn, the incidence of traumatic injury most
strongly predicted the severity of traumatic injury (b = 0.008, 95% CI 0.0003 ­ 0.0012). The tract-level unemployment rate
was associated with a 5% increase in the odds of hospital mortality among hospitalized trauma patients.
Conclusions: Several neighborhood characteristics were associated with the incidence, severity, and hospital mortality
from traumatic injury. However, crime rates and alcohol outlet density carried no such association. Prevention efforts
should focus on neighborhood characteristics such as population density, mean age of the residents, and
unemployment rate, regardless of crime rates and alcohol outlet density.

Background
Traumatic injuries cost more than $406 billion in medical
care and lost productivity annually (Finkelstein et al.
2006), and unintentional injury remains the leading cause
of death among several age groups in the USA (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention 2010). Thus, injury
prevention is a national priority. Across numerous med-
ical disciplines, socioeconomic status (SES) by various
measures has been strongly associated with higher inci-
dence rates, and severity of disease including cancers and
cardiovascular diseases (Kucharska-Newton et al. 2011;
Schwartz et al. 2003), greater operative mortality (Bennett
et al. 2010), and poorer overall survival rates represented
disproportionately in lower SES populations (Daly et al.
2002). Previous research suggest that neighborhood
characteristics, including measures of SES, may reflect
the relative availability and access to resources necessary
for well-being which can in turn influence outcomes of
medical care, particularly, in light of the limited access
to healthcare in low-income communities (Braveman
et al. 1988).
Because SES is a multidimensional construct (that con-
tinues to generate definitional debate), it is particularly
important that multiple measurement sources be inves-
tigated to elucidate the effect of `SES' along with other
neighborhood characteristics on trauma incidence, injury
severity, and hospital mortality. Previously identified predic-
tors include the following: individual income, employment
status, and education level (individual level) and house-
hold income, mean or median education level, and pro-
portion of a population living below a given poverty level
(neighborhood level) (Galobardes et al. 2006a, b; Daly
et al. 2002). Prior studies characterizing traumatic injury
within social contexts often focus on singular facets of a
complex mosaic of economic and social neighborhood at-
tributes (Newgard et al. 2011); however, each study has
its own respective limitations. Specifically, the exclusion
of one or more important confounding measures may
distort the relationship between SES and the phenom-
ena of traumatic injury (Cubbin et al. 2000; Hefernan
et al. 2011; Marcin et al. 2003; Newgard et al. 2011;
Zarzur et al. 2010; Rosen et al. 2009). As such, other fac-
tors shown to be associated with the occurrence and out-
comes of traumatic injury must be taken into account.
Alcohol retail outlet density is one such factor. The
associations between alcohol retail outlet density and
pedestrian injury collisions, car crashes and related injur-
ies, and assaults, including intimate partner violence have
all been well described (LaScala et al. 2001; Treno et al.
2007; Holder et al. 2000; Scribner et al. 1995). Alcohol
retail outlet density has been found to be associated with
various neighborhood characteristics, including poverty
and racial demographics (Berke et al. 2010). Each add-
itional alcohol outlet has been shown to increase crime
reports to police by 3%. Moreover, alcohol has long
been linked to the commission of crimes (Shupe 1953;
Ladouceur and Temple 1985). Finally, both interpersonal
and property crimes are associated with the incidence of
trauma (Hashima and Finkelhor 1999; Zimring and Zuehl
1986; Wilkinson et al. 2008; Cook 1986).
Clearly, a deeper understanding of the complex interac-
tions between environmental contexts, individual behavior,
exposure to crime, and traumatic injury may inform and
improve injury prevention initiatives. We conducted an
epidemiologic investigation that comprehensively examined
the relationship between multidimensional indicators of
SES with a focus on crime rates and alcohol retail density
in the neighborhood as risk factors for the incidence and
severity of, and mortality from, traumatic injury, in Dallas
County, Texas. This study is particularly unique in that
contextual measures were geographically linked from larger
data sources (e.g., the U.S. Census) via geocoding of trauma
patient home addresses. We postulated that exposure to
crime and the density of alcohol outlets in one's neighbor-
hood will be positively associated with the incidence of
hospitalization for and mortality from traumatic injuries,
independent of established SES measures such as income,
employment status, and education. Therefore, we sought to
answer two specific research questions. First, are the crime
rate and alcohol retail density in a patients' census tract
positively associated with their odds of hospitalization for
traumatic injury? Second, do crime rates and alcohol retail
density positively predict higher levels of injury severity and
mortality, independent of other neighborhood contextual
measures, patient behavior, and demographic measures?
These two research questions are systematically evaluated
in this study.
Methods
Data sources
Contextual U.S. Census, crime, and alcohol outlet data
SES data were obtained from the 2010 United States
Census website (U. S. Census Bureau 2012). These data
included population estimates for each census tract
included in this study, age and sex distributions, education
levels, proportions of persons living below the federal
poverty level, median household income, employment
rates, housing information (such as rates of owner-
occupied housing), and race/ethnicity information. Crime,
alcohol retail establishment, and patients' hospitalization
data were restricted to the year 2010 to be consistent with
the United States Census data.
Data for major crimes were obtained via the Uniform
Crime Reports (UCR) Part One crimes (Federal Bureau
of Investigation 2004) which include homicide, forcible
rape, robbery, assault, burglary (breaking and entering),
larceny/theft (including theft from motor vehicles),
unauthorized use of motor vehicles (theft of the motor

vehicle), and arson. Crime data for 2010, including the
type of crime and the address where the crime occurred
was provided by 20 of the 26 cities in Dallas County.
Patients from the six cities that did not provide data to
the UCR were excluded from the study. Finally, the Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission provided the addresses of
alcoholic beverage retail establishments throughout the
area of interest in this study. This allowed us to compute a
`density' of alcohol outlets given the estimated population
size of each patient's `neighborhood' census tract (alcohol
retail outlets per census tract/estimated population size
per census tract × 100,000 = alcohol retail outlets per
100,000 population for a given census tract) (Berke et al.
2010). We included only those alcohol retailers with active
licenses during 2010.
Patients were included in this study if they lived within
1 of the 20 police jurisdictions in Dallas County, Texas
that provided crime data to the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) (Figure 1). The
patients' initial hospitalization for traumatic injuries
occurred during 2010. Any subsequent hospital admis-
sion for any individual patient was excluded from the
dataset. Patients were excluded if they were 14 years
old or younger or hospitalized for burns as the primary
diagnosis, as these groups have their own injury and
mortality prediction models.
Patients: individual-level data
Patient-level data were collected directly from the Dallas-
Fort Worth Hospital Council Foundation (DFWHCF),
an organization that stores data from more than 90% of
all hospital discharges across the North Texas region.
After receiving institutional review board approval, we
obtained patient-level data for each discharge, including
self-reported patient demographics, home address, type
of insurance, length of stay, International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Edition - Clinical Modification (ICD-9)
codes for diagnoses, procedures, and external causes of
injury and poisoning (E-codes). Comorbid conditions
were enumerated using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Score
(Elixhauser et al. 1998).
Outcomes: trauma-related morbidity and mortality
The severity of traumatic injury was measured as the
probability of mortality using the Trauma Mortality Pre-
diction Model for the ICD-9 lexicon (Glance et al. 2009).
Hospital discharge status identified each patient as either
alive or deceased.
Statistical analysis
Geocoding and data linkage
The addresses of patients hospitalized for traumatic in-
jury were linked to crime rates and alcohol retail densities
in their respective census tracts using ArcGIS version 10.1
(ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) and the user-written Geocode
routine for Stata 12 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA).
The geocoding process was a point-in-polygon method
using TIGER/Line shapefiles provided online by the U. S.
Census Bureau (2012). All crime rates and alcohol retail
densities were population-adjusted/100,000 persons per
census tract.
Multi-level predictors of injury severity and hospital
mortality were assessed using hierarchical regression
methods in Stata 12 (StataCorp., College Station, TX,
USA). Predictor variables were excluded from multi-
variate analysis if they were not related to the outcome
in any bivariate analyses, unless they were theoretically
related to our research questions (e.g., represented crime
rates or alcohol outlet density), or were identified as
particularly relevant predictors of traumatic injury in
the literature reviewed above.
Multi-level regression analyses
Patient-level hospital mortality was analyzed using a
hierarchical logit model (Moore et al. 2010) which
corrected for random effects at both the hospital and
census tract levels. Model discrimination was reported
as area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
curve (Hosmer Jr et al. 2013). The variation in trauma/
100,000 population among census tracts was analyzed as
standardized incidence ratios (SIR), and for clarity, these
results are presented as tables and geographically below
(Figures 2 and 3). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to
ensure that the six jurisdictions excluded from this study
(because crime data were not available) did not differ from
those included in the analysis on any relevant outcome or
predictor variable.
Results
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of
Dallas County was estimated to be 2,348,702 people,
residing within 526 census tracts and occupying 908
square miles. The geographic boundary of this study
encompassed 510 contiguous census tracts covering
89% of the total land area in Dallas County. Due to
missing crime data by jurisdiction, the total population
denominator for this study was 2,279,737, which repre-
sented 97.1% of the county population. Using data from
the DFWHCF, 6,032 trauma patients met our selection
criteria for inclusion. The descriptive characteristics of
the sample, census tracts, and all independent and
dependent variables at the individual and census tract
levels are detailed in Table 1. There were 17,550 injuries,
representing 1,040 separate ICD-9 codes, diagnosed in
our cohort of 6,032 patients. A breakdown of these ICD-9
codes is provided in Tables 2, 3, and 4.
First, we expected that crime rates and alcohol outlet
density, independent of SES, patient behavior, and demo-

graphics, would be associated with the incidence of
traumatic injuries sufficient to warrant hospitalization.
The mean incidence of hospitalization for trauma was
264.05/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 260/100,000
to 273.83/100,000). Low proportions of owner-occupied
housing, followed by the proportion of residents aged
65 years and older, were closely associated with traumatic
injury (Table 5). Further, a greater proportion of tract
residents younger than 18 was associated with a lower
incidence of traumatic injury. A greater proportion of
whites and blacks (compared to `other races' and His-
panics/Latinos) living in the neighborhood was also
associated with increased trauma rates, as the proportion
of white and black residents was positively associated with
traumatic injury. Population density (persons per square
mile) was modestly protective from trauma, and neither
the crime rate nor alcohol outlet densities were significant
predictors of the incidence of hospitalization for treatment
of traumatic injuries (Table 5).
Next, we examined whether neighborhood characteris-
tics, beyond traditional SES measures, would predict the
severity of traumatic injury and hospital mortality as a
result of traumatic injury (in particular, the crime rate and
density of alcohol retail outlets). We found that neither
the rate of Part One crimes nor the density of alcohol
retail outlets were associated with greater injury severity

(Table 6). Individual characteristics, specifically, the number
of medical comorbidities (Elixhauser Comorbidity Score),
alcohol intoxication at hospital presentation, penetrating
injury, and male sex were all positively associated with the
severity of the traumatic injury. Black race, however, was
associated with less severe injury than other races.
With respect to mortality from traumatic injuries,
the unemployment rate was the only contextual SES
predictor associated with mortality due to traumatic
injury. Neither the crime rate nor the alcohol outlet
density of the neighborhood was associated with traumatic
mortality among citizens of Dallas County (Table 7). At
the patient level, penetrating mechanism of injury was
associated with two times the odds of mortality com-
pared to other mechanisms of injury. Finally, more
severe injuries were associated with greater mortality,
and age was associated with a 4% increase in mortality
due to trauma.
Discussion
We found that several well-established neighborhood-
level SES measures were significantly associated with
injury that required hospital admission and treatment.
However, as expected, these predictors were less robust
than individual-level characteristics of the patient. Further,
the indicators of alcohol outlet density and crime rate
in the neighborhood were not predictors in the present
analysis. In summary, we found that other neighborhood-
level SES predictors of traumatic injury included a lower
population density, lower proportion of owner-occupied
housing (e.g., more rental properties in a given neighbor-
hood), the proportion of the tract population 18 years old
or younger, as well as the percentage 65 years and older.
Interestingly, both the neighborhood proportions of
whites and black/African Americans exhibited a modest
but significant increase in the incidence of hospitalization
to treat traumatic injuries.

The relationship between traumatic injury and neigh-
borhood characteristics has been studied from various
perspectives. Zarzur et al. found that neighborhood SES
was inversely related to incidence rates of trauma; how-
ever, SES was defined only in terms of neighborhood
income cut points in one county in Tennessee (Zarzur
et al. 2010). Cubbin and colleagues noted that SES (in
this case, income-to-need ratio, education level, occupa-
tion, race, ethnicity) is a robust predictor of mortality
due to traumatic injury; however, the effect depended
upon the indicator of SES and the cause and severity of
injury (Cubbin and Smith 2002). Such factors include risk-
taking behavior, comorbid conditions, alcohol intoxication,
and mechanism of injury. Since these phenomena appear
to be multifactorial in nature, they should be investigated in
a similar fashion. As we sought to understand how each
measure of SES is independently associated with trauma
morbidity and mortality, multiple levels of data (e.g., both
neighborhood and individual level measures of income and
poverty) were applied.
Injury prevention is a matter of increasing significance, as
the Institute of Medicine published the report, `Hospital-
Based Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point' due to the
increasing demands of emergency and trauma care and
the current capacity limitations in 2007 (Committee on
the Future of Emergency Care in the United States Health
System 2007). The authors state that, `In 2003, nearly 114
million visits were made to hospital emergency depart-
ments... About one-quarter of those visits were due to
unintentional injuries.' In 2011, the American Association
for the Surgery of Trauma Prevention Committee issued a
call to action for trauma centers, which recommended
that prevention programs target neighborhoods where
important socioeconomic and cultural factors need to
be identified (Davis et al. 2011).
Although the relationship between race and traumatic
injury has been well documented, there is limited research
that incorporates both individual race of the patient and
the racial composition of their home neighborhood. For
instance, at the individual level, Cubbin et al. (2000) found
that black adults were at 61% age-adjusted greater risk for

traumatic injury compared to whites using the National
Health Interview Survey data. Newgard and colleagues
conducted an ecological study of emergency medical
system (EMS) data from nine cities across the USA and
Canada. This study reported a positive association between
the rate of major traumatic injuries and the percentage
of the non-white population (Newgard et al. 2011). Our
results were concordant with the literature on race and
traumatic injury, as we found a positive relationship
between racial composition at the neighborhood level
(e.g., proportion of black and white), and traumatic injury
in general. However, we did find that blacks and whites
(compared with Hispanic/Latinos and other racial groups)
were more likely to have injuries of greater severity. These
studies were substantively different from the present
investigation, as each study evaluated one level of data
only, and Cubbin and colleagues assessed mortality only,
with risk factors assessed only at the individual level.
The role of ethnicity at the individual and neighborhood
level provides an interesting albeit complex and multi-
dimensional research question as it relates to traumatic
injury and neighborhood context. Hispanics have rates
of violence and crime that are closely approaching and
surpassing those of blacks, and they are likely to live in
areas that are characterized by social disorder, poor living
conditions, and poverty (Gonzalez-Barrera and Lopez 2013;
Reingle et al. 2012). Therefore, given the potential for
traumatic injury due to violence and crime-related activity,
we were surprised that Hispanic ethnicity was not identi-
fied as a risk factor for injury, injury severity, or mortality.
We can only postulate that this may be a function of a
lower likelihood of treatment seeking or measurement
error (for instance, those of `Hispanic/Latino' descent may
be less likely to self-report this as a personal identity).
However, elucidating the phenomena underlying this find-
ing is beyond the scope of this study.
Our results regarding alcohol outlet density and trauma
differ from the extant literature, and we expect that
methodological differences may explain much of this vari-
ability. For instance, Mair et al. investigated the association

between alcohol retail density, specifically bars, and assault-
related injury hospitalizations. Mair observed a positive
relationship between the number of alcohol outlets and
injury due to assault; however, this effect varied according
to the demographic characteristics of the neighborhood
(Mair et al. 2012). In addition, studies of alcohol policy
have found that reducing alcohol availability by reducing
the number of alcohol outlets in a community or the
hours and days of sale resulted in lower rates of injury
almost immediately (Zhu et al. 2004; Scribner et al. 1999;
Britt et al. 2005; Popova et al. 2009). Therefore, we expect
that this differential finding is a function of our inclusion
of both on- and off-premise alcohol retail outlets as this
distinction has been shown to have unique effects on
outcome (Campbell et al. 2009). Further, alcohol retail
outlets are more densely located in lower socioeconomic
locations (Berke et al. 2010). Although not the primary
focus of this paper, we believe that the intrinsic correlation
between alcohol outlets and neighborhood SES will
account for the lack of observed independent effect of
alcohol outlets on traumatic injury.
Mortality from traumatic injury has long been the
focus of research to identify risk and protective fac-
tors that are amendable to intervention in the hos-
pital setting. Typically, this research models the risk
of highly specific types of injuries, injury patterns, or
the benefits of various treatments. However, researchers
have recently begun to expand the scope of their
research beyond the hospital walls to investigate how
features of the geographic and social environment con-
tribute to traumatic injury mortality (Alkhoury et al.
2009; Arthur et al. 2008; Centerwall 1995; Chapman
et al. 2010; Cubbin et al. 2000; Haider et al. 2008). This
inclusion of administrative, diagnostic, trauma registry
data has tremendous potential to identify the cases of
injury and mortality where self-reported information
and arrest data do not suffice.
Our study has several limitations. First, we limited
our geographic scope to include the census tracts
with crime rate data (excluding six police jurisdictions
that did not provide such data). While this allowed
inclusion of 89% of the land area and 97.1% of the
county population, limited selection bias was observed
(see Tables 2, 3, and 4). Other limitations of this
study include the administrative nature of the hospital
discharge data. Although 64.2% of the patients in this
study were treated at verified trauma centers, where
registrars carefully document pertinent injury and
clinical data, no clinical or administrative database is
entirely free of error. Next, our analyses treat the pa-
tient as if all received comparable levels of exposure
to the neighborhood characteristics (at the census
tract level) examined, and the duration of each
patient's exposure to their respective environments
cannot be measured with these data. Moreover, all
traumatic injuries were given equal weight with re-
gard to association with the predictors though differ-
ences in association may exist among subgroups of
injuries and predictors. Finally, all of the UCR index
crimes were aggregated to define a tract's `crime rate,'
as we did not have a specific hypothesis as to which
types of crime might be most closely related to trau-
matic injury.
In light of these limitations, the major strength of this
paper is the broad, epidemiologic perspective it provides.

Despite the large number of studies that have been done
in this field, this study is one of the most comprehensive,
investigatory, epidemiological studies to date to establish
the correlates at both the neighborhood and individual level
using hospital data, census information, police records,
and alcoholic beverage licensing datasets. Further, we were
able to establish direct associations between multi-level
measures and `injury' in general. This is important epide-
miologically in terms of prevention; communities with
high crime rates or diverse racial compositions may be
identified as ideal locations for primary prevention.
Conclusions
Although individual-level measures were more
robust predictors of traumatic injury and mortality,
neighborhood-level crime and context plays a role
in the incidence of traumatic injury requiring
hospitalization. Further research is needed to assess
which injury prevention efforts may yield the greatest
benefit in reducing rates of traumatic injury and
mortality, as even small effects at the neighborhood
level may have vast effects on the targeted popula-
tion as a whole.
