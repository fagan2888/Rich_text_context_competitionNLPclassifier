Introduction
In this article, we explore definitions and criticisms of the
concept of resilience within government policy, social justice
perspectives, and the resilience research literature that are
said to shape the field today. We then introduce our own
approach and describe how Boingboing, our community of
practice and social enterprise, supports the development of
resilience research and practice that includes a strong inequal-
ities dimension (www.boingboing.org.uk). This includes con-
ducting academic research that advocates for people facing
embedded societal inequalities, and is more focused on chal-
lenging inequitable policy agendas; engaging in co-produced
research containing socially transformative rather than solely
personally transformative elements; facilitating supported
agency, and co-identifying and co-delivering responses to
adversities (these may be addressing societal inequalities but
may more realistically include tackling prejudice, discrimina-
tion, stigma, and stereotyping); and encouraging the research
community to be open to and prepared to undertake co-pro-
duced research with groups that are perceived to be more
challenging to work with, and so are underrepresented in the
literature, but whose voices are equally or more important as
a result. We outline some examples and steps that we are tak-
ing toward our goal of consolidating resilience research and
practice with a social justice approach in the support of chil-
dren, young people, and families.
Resilience Research
Initially spurred by observation of children who performed
unexpectedly well in unfavorable circumstances, the first
wave of resilience research sought to identify correlates of
resilience with a focus on the unique qualities possessed by
the person or child (Masten, 2007). With resilience perceived
as purely internal it is the individual who becomes tasked

Practice With an Inequalities Approach

Abstract
The concept of resilience has evolved, from an individual-level characteristic to a wider ecological notion that takes into
account broader person­environment interactions, generating an increased interest in health and well-being research,
practice and policy. At the same time, the research and policy-based attempts to build resilience are increasingly under attack
for responsibilizing individuals and maintaining, rather than challenging, the inequitable structure of society. When adversities
faced by children and young people result from embedded inequality and social disadvantage, resilience-based knowledge has
the potential to influence the wider adversity context. Therefore, it is vital that conceptualizations of resilience encompass
this potential for marginalized people to challenge and transform aspects of their adversity, without holding them responsible
for the barriers they face. This article outlines and provides examples from an approach that we are taking in our research
and practice, which we have called Boingboing resilience. We argue that it is possible to bring resilience research and practice
together with a social justice approach, giving equal and simultaneous attention to individuals and to the wider system. To
achieve this goal, we suggest future research should have a co-produced and inclusive research design that overcomes the
dilemma of agency and responsibility, contains a socially transformative element, and has the potential to empower children,
young people, and families.

with compensating for their disadvantaged circumstances.
The second wave of research was interested in associations
between correlates of resilience. Identification of risk and
protective factors as moderators and mediators of desirable
outcomes expanded from the micro level of the individual to
incorporate meso-level structures such as the family, school,
and local community. The disadvantaged child is, from this
perspective, no longer left wholly responsible for their out-
comes. In addition to their own attributes, caregivers,
schools, neighborhoods, and other community organizations
are all seen to play a part in influencing children's resilience.
Putting the findings of the first two waves into practice, the
third wave of research focused on developing and testing
interventions. By endeavoring to improve outcomes for peo-
ple facing adversity, valuable learning around effectiveness
and the role of context brought to attention both the dynamic
nature of resilience processes, and the importance of culture
in defining meaningful outcomes (Ungar, 2004). Applying
what is defined as a positive outcome within mainstream
contexts to disadvantaged and marginalized groups may be
inappropriate, and may lead to further exclusion. A focus on
wider context and culture encourages a more systemic under-
standing of resilience in which the individual and his or her
environment interact to produce, and construct, outcomes.
Presently, the fourth wave is said to be in ascendance, as the
discoveries of the first three waves become assimilated with
more sophisticated methods of investigation to develop a
richer understanding of the multilevel, contextualized, and
dynamic nature of resilience (e.g., Kassis, Artz, Moldenhauer,
Geczey, & Rossiter, 2015). Using Bronfenbrenner's (1977)
human ecology theory, an ecological understanding of resil-
ience places both the individual and the adversity within a
dynamic multilevel context, where the impact of higher level
factors (e.g., social, economic, cultural) on factors proximal to
children is emphasized (Cassen, Feinstein, & Graham, 2009).
Resilience itself is not a unified concept, and a long history
of controversy means that there is little consensus on its pre-
cise meaning. The only feature common to most definitions
used by academic authors (see Table 1) is that resilience
assumes adversity and is relative to it (Noltemeyer & Bush,
2013). Exactly how resilience relates to adversity is conceptu-
alized in a variety of ways, including helping people and com-
munities adapt to adversity, interact with it, or transform
aspects of it. A further complication is that the understanding
of resilience and how it relates to adversity also depend upon
the nature of adversity (whether defined explicitly or implic-
itly), which may or may not be related to social disadvantage.
As shown in Table 1, there are 17 subtly distinct concep-
tualizations of resilience that we have counted in use by aca-
demic authors. Only three of these definitions include any
potential to alter aspects of the wider adversity context,
which are those of Hart, Gagnon, Aumann, and Heaver
(2013); Lerner (2006); and Ungar (2008). For instance, the
notions of "navigating" and "negotiating" hold the potential
to have some influence over the availability of resources for
others (Ungar, 2008, p. 225). Similarly, the notion of "recip-
rocally influential relations between a person" and his or her
environment (Lerner, 2006, p. 40) captures at least some
potential for the environmental context itself to be altered.
However, presenting such exchanges as mutually beneficial
fails to acknowledge the extent to which structural power
imbalances consistently undermine the efforts of those fac-
ing the most profound disadvantage.
For the majority of definitions, resilience is anchored
within an individual perspective, as it is the outcome which is
most often of interest. However, mechanisms that enhance
resilience can be portrayed as residing both internally and
externally across the different levels of the system. This
breadth has important implications for assumptions about the
range of resources available when making resilient moves--
small changes that can be made quickly and which acknowl-
edgewheretheyoungpersonisstartingfrom.Whiledefinitions
which conceive of resilience as internal draw largely upon a
person's psychological resources, more ecological approaches
which encompass wider social factors also place responsibility
upon institutions and society. The different understandings of
resilience can be viewed within the context of how resilience
research has developed in the "four waves" said to have shaped
the field today (see Masten, 2007).
Health Inequality and Resilience
Following international recognition of the impacts of myriad
social inequalities on health (e.g., Black, Morris, Smith, &
Townsend, 1980; Lawn et al., 2008) the ethical obligation to
tackle health inequalities has been steadily gaining influence
as a political issue (Crombie, Irvine, Elliott, & Wallace,
2005; Marmot & Bell, 2012). Health inequalities are defined
as "disparities in health (and in its key determinants) that are
systematically associated with social advantage/disadvan-
tage" (Braveman & Gruskin, 2003, p. 256). It is not possible
to talk meaningfully about health inequalities without talking
about ethics and social change. With health and well-being
now recognized as social phenomena, questions about how
to tackle health inequalities become reframed as questions of
how to transform the social structures and systems which
produce inequality (Commission on Social Determinants of
Health, 2008; Wilson & Pickett, 2009).
The reduction of health inequalities is now a key strategic
priority both in the United Kingdom (Public Health England,
2013) and internationally (World Health Organization, 2014).
Within this context, building people's resilience through an
individual focus is increasingly being presented within gov-
ernment policy and supplementary papers as a viable mecha-
nism for the reduction of health challenges (Children and
Young People's Health Outcomes Forum, 2012a, 2012b;
Department of Health, 2010a; Public Health England, 2014).
In government explanations that privilege lifestyle choice and
a person's internal capacities and abilities, it is the individual
who bears the brunt of responsibility for reducing health
Hart et al. 3
inequalities (Department of Health, 2010b), for example,
pressure on individuals to reduce their alcohol consumption
within a society that encourages excessive drinking with
extended liquor licenses, "happy hours", and cheap super-
market offers.
Criticisms of Resilience
From a social justice perspective, however, responsibility lies
to a larger extent with governments, and global decision mak-
ers, in their power to determine the economic, social, and
health policies that shape the wider socioeconomic condi-
tions. Taking a capabilities perspective, individuals also have
agency to affect their own trajectories and those of others
(Nussbaum, 2003; Sen, 1999). It is from within the shifting of
responsibility for health outcomes from governing institu-
tions onto individuals, and vice versa, that critique of resil-
ience arises. Reacting to the tendency for neoliberal practices
and policies to emphasize personal responsibility, while
reducing levels of state services, cultural theorists, and social
critics consistently warn against an emphasis on promoting
resilience (Bottrell, 2013; de Lint & Chazal, 2013; Friedli,
2012, 2013; Harrison, 2012). They identify the concept of
resilience as a vehicle for the responsibilization of individuals
in place of social structures and governing institutions (e.g.,
Bottrell, 2013; de Lint & Chazal, 2013; Harrison, 2012;
Schmidt, 2015; see Table 2). Little attempt has been made
within the resilience literature to offer a response to this

Bottrell (2013) As the individualised "can do" notion of resilience, twinned with the privatisation of responsibilities, circulates
in and flows from policy texts, it obscures historical and more recent structural inequalities that are

deemed to be their failings, deficits and unhealthy dependencies.

critique despite many resilience frameworks working from a
risk/adversity perspective (Noltemeyer & Bush, 2013), which
may naturally be assumed to capture inequality issues.
Political and economic influences may become concealed
when higher level structural factors are assumed to be only
as influential as more intermediary influences, such as the
personal capacities and behavior of individuals. Structural
determinants are no longer seen as "the causes of the causes"
(Marmot, 2005) when they are being given equal status. This
paves the way for internalized explanations to proliferate
when lifestyle factors of behavioral origin appear to exert the
greatest influence over health and well-being outcomes
(Department of Health, 2010b) and a focus on the level of the
individual and on higher level structural factors is presented
as mutually exclusive. Responsibilization of individuals then
occurs when structural accountability is denied and health
inequalities come to be understood wholly as the result of
these individual choices and internal capacities.
To critics, a focus on resilience is seen as synonymous
with accepting this internalized explanatory model for health
inequalities. Many resilience practitioners' and researchers'
own understandings and experiences of processes of inequal-
ity and disadvantage are not congruent with this model.
Particularly for those who identify as members of, or who are
working alongside, marginalized and disadvantaged groups,
the power of conditions of injustice to constantly undermine
caring work does not go unnoticed (Prilleltensky &
Prilleltensky, 2005). And in our own projects the impact of
Hart et al. 5
structural challenges such as poor housing, transport, and
income is often highlighted in the "basics" category of our
resilience framework (Hart, Blincow, & Thomas, 2007).
By contrast, abstracted from context, resilience takes on
the appearance of an independent variable separable from
higher level political and economic factors, and structural
accountability becomes deniable, or at least ignorable. It is
important to note that decontextualization of resilience also
fundamentally ignores findings in resilience research, where
context is cardinal for adaptive development (Ungar, 2012).
As the internalized resilience presented in policy bears little
resemblance to the contextualized ecological models com-
mon today, many resilience researchers and practitioners
may feel such critique is simply not relevant to their work,
even though they may also not feel empowered to influence
or challenge policy. Nevertheless, the problem of conflating
explanatory levels continues to be an issue.
To overcome these difficulties, Harrison (2012) argues that
resilience might be best replaced with the concept of vulnera-
bility. She suggests that while references to resilience empha-
size individual responsibility, the term vulnerability suggests
moral obligation for those in positions of power toward those
who are less powerful. Despite noting that vulnerability can
imply people lack agency or are "helpless victims" (p. 99), she
proposes that nevertheless the term is preferable, as, in contrast
to resilience, vulnerability can be reduced by intervening in the
political and economic allocation of resources. To resilience
researchers and practitioners working with disadvantaged and
marginalized individuals and communities, a focus on vulner-
ability in place of resilience is neither constructive nor ethical.
For marginalized populations, left abandoned to their own fate,
the only persons available to act upon their interests may well
be themselves and those in close proximity. Relying solely
upon appeals to those in power to take on moral responsibility
for outcomes antithetical to their own interests remains an
insufficient course of action. Furthermore, such an approach
risks further marginalizing the most excluded groups in society
who are already poorly represented in research. And finally, by
replacing the concept of resilience with vulnerability, we risk
missing the ways in which some people can display vulnerabil-
ity, and at the same time strengths and capability (Zautra, Hall,
& Murray, 2010). To illustrate the point from one of our own
resilience-building research projects, a young woman who
consistently displayed considerable signs of distress and vul-
nerability, often needing to leave meetings, also revealed that
she was a prominent and successful campaigner for mental
health justice with a leading young people's mental health
charity, simultaneously showing strength and capability.
We propose that approaches should address both individ-
ual and structural elements that could make a difference,
while acknowledging that the range of individual strategies
available may be largely determined by higher level political
and economic factors (e.g., healthy eating may not be possi-
ble for someone on a low income due to the often higher
price of "healthy" foods than "junk" foods, and is not
necessarily about their individual conscious unwillingness to
adopt a diet that the government tells them will be better for
their health).
Resilience and Social Justice
The need for resilience research and practice development to
engage with inequalities issues, and consequently the accom-
panying critique, is becoming increasingly urgent (Ungar,
Ghazinour, & Richter, 2013). We propose that it is time for
resilience to go beyond understanding how individuals cope
with adversity, to challenge the structures that create disad-
vantages in the first place, and contribute to the development
of a new wave of research that unites resilience research and
practice development with social justice and activism. This
process should invite the relocation of community members,
researchers, and policy makers in dynamic, multilevel pro-
cesses. They can then seek to challenge the contributory
practices that conflate higher level causes with proximal
determinants.
Recognizing that an unjust system unavoidably demands
resilience because it relates to adversity, we suggest, as does
Bottrell (2009), that we begin by asking, (a) to what extent
adversity will be tolerated, on the assumption that resilient
individuals can and do cope; and (b) how much adversity
resilient individuals should endure before social arrange-
ments, rather than individuals, are targeted for intervention.
However, we propose it is then necessary to consider broader
shifts that might emerge from resilient moves at the individ-
ual/micro level, where there is potential for knowledge and
practice to travel and spread and in the process target social
determinants (Aranda & Hart, 2014). For instance, in our
mental health­related projects we identify stigma and dis-
crimination as key adversities faced by people with mental
health problems, including people in our research team. Our
work involves considering ways to challenge that adversity
in our daily lives, in our local communities, and at a national
level by media campaigns and lobbying.
In addition, we notice that while a social justice­oriented
understanding of resilience has been emphasized in adult
populations (Brown, Payne, Dressner, & Green, 2010;
Irizarry, 2008; Maxwell, Locke, & Scheurich, 2014),
remarkably few resilience authors or researchers explicitly
attempt to incorporate inequalities perspective when work-
ing with children and young people (Hart, Blincow, &
Thomas, 2007; Prilleltensky & Prilleltensky, 2005; Ungar,
2015), and therefore there is a clear literature gap in
addressing this in younger populations, for whom adults
may assume they know best.
At Boingboing, we use a strategic resilience-focused
methodology to support disadvantaged children, young peo-
ple (up to age 25 years), and their families in overcoming
the adversity they face in their lives (Hart, Blincow, &
Thomas, 2007), attempting to address this literature gap in
practice. Our work has always been informed by an
6 SAGE Open
inequalities awareness and we have developed and applied
the concept of an "inequalities imagination" (Hart, Blincow,
& Thomas, 2007; Hall & Hart, 2004; Hart, Hall, & Henwood,
2003). We define adversity in relation to social disadvan-
tage, and building on more recent and socio-ecologically
contextualized definitions (e.g., Lerner, 2006; Ungar, 2008),
we construct resilience as, "overcoming adversity, whilst
also potentially subtly changing, or even dramatically trans-
forming, (aspects of) that adversity" (Hart, Gagnon, et al.,
2013). This creates the possibility for resilience-based inter-
ventions to have an emancipatory function (i.e., potential to
overcome adversity and oppression) and contribute toward
systemic change, for example by changing school policy to
cultivate a more supportive and positive school culture that
discourages discrimination, alongside targeted work to build
resilience strategies in pupils to deal with stigma and bully-
ing. Current resilience interventions based on an ecological
understanding (e.g., Daniel & Wassell, 2002; Kourkoutas &
Xavier, 2010) have the potential to target a number of
dynamic processes at a range of levels and to overcome
inequalities. Within the systemic approach, resilience
researchers should introduce specific directions for inter-
ventions and social policies, through identifying processes
that significantly mitigate the effects of adverse life condi-
tions (Luthar & Brown, 2007). In most instances, however,
practicalities of implementation result in interventions pre-
dominantly targeting factors proximal to the individual,
while acknowledgment of more distal processes remains
fairly cursory. For example, many practitioners feel com-
fortable with and skilled in helping people to make micro
"resilient moves" in their lives but feel less empowered and
knowledgeable about influencing or challenging policies.
Boingboing supports the development of resilience
research and practice that includes a strong inequalities
dimension, underpinned by a co-production framework.
According to the Social Care Institute for Excellence
(2015), co-production is key in developing public services;
the advantages include cost-effective services, integration,
improved user and carer experiences of services, and
increased community capacity. At Boingboing, our co-pro-
duction work is carried out both with and as disadvantaged
communities; most of the team working on our research
themselves experience additional challenges and/or social
exclusion. We focus on trying to include those of us who
might be perceived as highly disadvantaged and marginal-
ized in all stages of our research and knowledge transfer
activities, amplifying the voices of others who experience
social disadvantage, mental health problems, disability, and
other vulnerabilities at different stages in life. We carry out
co-productive resilience research and practice in our vari-
ous identities as affiliates to the community of practice
Boingboing.
From this perspective, we have witnessed firsthand how
the concept of resilience generates interest and momentum
because it inspires (e.g., Big Lottery Fund UK, who award
grants to good causes, made a £75 million investment in
HeadStart programs in schools in England with much of the
funding going to resilience-based initiatives; Big Lottery,
2013; KidsMatter primary school mental health initiative in
Australia; KidsMatter, n.d.); therefore, there is a clear imper-
ative to continue resilience research and practice to strengthen
children and young people and enable them to deal with
adversities they may face. With the support of concrete
examples from a range of our completed and ongoing
research, we outline ways in which others can incorporate
resilience theory, interventions, and continuing research
practice, into an overarching critical approach which privi-
leges knowledge co-produced by researchers and communi-
ties (Hart, Maddison, & Wolff, 2007).
Knowledge Co-Production
Traditional forms of knowledge production and transfer,
such as the objective measurement of outcomes, are unable
to sufficiently capture the multifaceted impacts of health
inequalities within a dynamic system. This is partly due to
insensitivity to the perspectives of communities. Not only
does academic knowledge (Gibbons et al., 1994) have a
strong tendency to decontextualize people and communities,
but it is also associated with elitism and status inequality
(Hart & Aumann, 2007). We suggest that new forms of con-
textualized, egalitarian knowledge production and exchange
are more appropriate for understanding the multifaceted
dynamic nature of adversity, resilience, inequalities, and
transformational change. We advocate a peer-reviewed,
applied, heterogeneous, problem-centered, trans-disciplinary
and change-orientated mode of knowledge, with a critical
dimension of being "co-produced by the university and com-
munity" (Hart, Maddison, & Wolff, 2007, p. 6). Developed
in the context of University­Community partnerships, co-
produced knowledge develops richer understandings of resil-
ience, captures its costs, and detects hidden resilience, while
also empowering people and communities with the tools and
voice to challenge processes of injustice (Bolzan & Gale,
2012). An example from Boingboing concerns a group of
young adults with learning disabilities. They are working
with PhD student, Anne Rathbone, one of the co-authors of
this paper, on a co-productive project that enables them to
understand and document their own struggles and capacities
in relation to the concept of resilience. They have been highly
motivated to develop data collection tools. These include a
resilience game that when played, helps the group to order
their research data in a way that enables the cognitive func-
tioning of the group to be accommodated. The young people
have also been highly motivated to support other young peo-
ple to develop resilience through making their game avail-
able more widely (Hart, 2016a). Finally, they have challenged
wider inequalities in access to transport through lobbying
Members of Parliament (MP) and transport providers (Hart,
2016a).

Looking at resilience through a social justice lens, the

for marginalized, excluded, and disadvantaged children and
young people, and supporters of their capacities and opportu-
nities for self-advocacy. Co-produced research is necessary
to capture the complexities of these groups by enabling a
holistic approach. For instance, in our work in schools, we
work across the school system in collaboration with all staff
groups and levels, as well as students, to understand the resil-
ience mechanisms of students, especially those who are dis-
advantaged, and to improve their resilience outcomes. In one
of our Imagine projects in Greece, undertaken by Elias
Kourkoutas and colleagues (Kourkoutas, Georgiadi, &
Plexousakis, 2016), school staff, university students, child
development center staff, and academics joined with parents
of children with complex needs in a resilience-building
Community of Practice (CoP). Applying lessons from the
resilience research field to their own contexts, including our
resilience framework, was the CoP's focus. This local prac-
tice has now influenced the work of other academics in Crete
and has also impacted the way that some local councils
deliver mental health support. In particular, it has led to more
community-based resilience-building practices being
adopted and the sharing of expertise between parents, schools
staff, local councils, students, and academics becoming rou-
tine. University teaching curricula have also been adapted to
support trainee teachers to learn about and embed resilience-
building approaches through this sharing of expertise.
Transformative Practice
We propose that resilience work should encompass a "basics"
dimension designed specifically to tackle deprivation and
associated health inequalities (Hart, Blincow, & Thomas,
2007). At a broader level, the Prilleltenskys' concepts of
epistemic and transformational psychopolitical validity
(Prilleltensky, 2003; Prilleltensky & Prilleltensky, 2005;
Prilleltensky, Prilleltensky, & Voorhees, 2008) provide a
constructive framework for uniting micro- and macro-level
factors, through combining understanding of psychological
and political influences. Epistemic psychopolitical validity
refers to using psychology and politics in understanding
social phenomena. Resilience researchers can use this to
consider how their understanding of adversity and resilience
relates to individual and higher level structural influences,
such as asking whether their work includes an understanding
of (a) the impact of global, political, and economic forces on
the issue at hand; (b) how global, political, and economic
forces, as well as social norms, influence the perceptions and
experiences of affected individuals and groups; and (c) how
the cognitions, behaviors, experiences, feelings, and percep-
tions of individuals, groups, and entire communities perpetu-
ate or transform the relevant forces and dynamics. They
should also consider whether they appreciate how political
and psychological powers interact at the personal, relational,
and collective levels, affecting the issue at hand.
We argue that resilience research and practice has the
potential to use psychopolitical validity as a guide toward
liberation at the personal, interpersonal, and structural
domains. To challenge our own practice and those of others,
we might ask questions such as whether interventions (a)
promote psychopolitical literacy; (b) educate participants on
the timing, components, targets, and dynamics of strategies
to overcome oppression; (c) empower participants to take
action to address political inequities and social injustice
within their relationships, settings, communities, or even
internationally; (d) promote solidarity and strategic alliances
and coalitions with groups facing similar issues; and (e)
account for the subjectivity and psychological limitations of
agents of change.
In our ongoing work, we have made modest steps in these
directions. For example, all 16 individual projects of an over-
all program, on which we are working, involve some form of
activity designed to challenge adversity conditions. We
described above how a group of young adults with learning
disabilities are tackling inequalities in transport provision.
Emerging findings from other projects suggest that through
lived experience, practitioner and academic partners can
work together with an inequalities-focused approach to resil-
ience-building. For example, in the building resilience for
well-being and recovery course, we developed a session
focused on "changing the odds" in which learners shared
experiences of challenging adversity and developed action
plans. One participant highlighted discriminatory attitudes
toward people with mental health problems in her church,
and with the support of the learning group developed an
action plan involving challenging church authorities to take
the issue seriously and to circulate educational material.
To overcome the dilemma of agency and responsibility,
one possibility is to move away from modernist notions of
agency, which privilege voluntary, deliberate, or conscious
efforts (Shove, Pantzar, & Watson, 2012), toward a focus on
actions as practices (Aranda & Hart, 2014). In terms of health
inequalities, resilience, and ecology, this means moving
away from focusing on individuals as sources of action, or on
structures as external forces. Instead, accounts of resilience,
capacities, or capabilities are intimately entwined with
norms, practices, and institutions, which in turn are shaped
and modified by those enactments. Practices, rather than
individuals, become the unit of analysis.
A practice lens therefore suggests that no one, single fac-
tor controls change, including practitioners themselves who
do not exist in isolation (and in this theoretical sense of the
term "practitioner", we mean anyone). Yet opportunities for
intervention or change remain possible; practitioners can
operate in a number of ways to influence elements of prac-
tice (Shove et al., 2012). This entails exploring how practices
spread through research, intervention, or organization. Any
attempt to understand resilient moves must acknowledge that
8 SAGE Open
these attempts are set within a nexus of global health prac-
tices seeking to address or tackle inequalities. Research
should pay attention to the materiality of policies, reports,
public health documents, and strategies; for instance, here in
England that would include the recent government reforms
now influencing the National Health Service (NHS), and
reconfigurations of informal and formal health and social
care services. It is worth holding in mind that, as we argued
earlier, responsibilization of individuals occurs when struc-
tural accountability is denied, and health inequalities come to
be understood wholly as the result of individual lifestyle
choices and capacities.
Participation
Co-production of knowledge means committing to work
with and alongside individuals and communities to better
understand their adversity context, including the impacts of
inequality, and resilience-building as an ecological process.
Particular attention should be paid to issues of power and
power relations, how power imbalances manifest and how
they can be challenged in resilience research and practice
development. The relationship between power and knowl-
edge and the existence of different types of knowledge and
competing perspectives should be acknowledged. We should
be sensitive to how various types of knowledge are valued
and constructed and for what purpose; and how they are
used, exchanged, and managed (Hart, Davies, et al., 2013).
We acknowledge that fully engaging people and communi-
ties in research requires resources, effort, time, and manage-
ment, and often the practicalities are challenging, but we
urge researchers to consider the value that co-produced
knowledge adds to understandings of resilience. The simple
but powerful way we incorporate this into our research
agenda is through inviting study participants to become co-
researchers and take an active role in the whole research pro-
cess, in a way that is appropriate to their needs. In this we are
not denying the complex power issues (and indeed practi-
calities) involved in making this happen. However, as a
group we are committed to co-productive research and are
constantly striving to improve our practice in terms of shared
ownership and accountability.
Empowerment
Working with and alongside people and communities not
only involves an undertaking to celebrate capability and
build capacity as we share knowledge and practice but also
provides potential to empower people and groups to chal-
lenge their adversity context. However, we must be espe-
cially careful around the meaning and use of empowerment.
Within government policy, empowerment is presented as
"empowering individuals to make healthier choices"
(Department of Health, 2010b, p. 2). However, when we
refer to empowerment we are interested in the emancipatory
potential. In the context of resilience and inequalities, this
means supporting individuals, groups, and communities to
increase their control over the events that determine their
health and well-being in the first place (World Health
Organization, 2014). We also see ways in which more collec-
tive community-based understandings of empowerment, rep-
resented by the disability rights slogan of "nothing about us
without us," has been reinvented into the more individual
"no decision about me without me" (Department of Health,
2010c, p. 13), reflecting the need for involvement rather than
protection. For example, another PhD student in our group,
Stephanie Coombe, supported the development of a resil-
ience-building approach involving the whole-school com-
munity, including children (Hart, 2016b). Changes were
made to the school day that meant children from disadvan-
taged backgrounds were able to make choices that increased
their chances of going on to further studies or gaining
employment. They could choose and/or be paid to develop
clubs for hobbies and work experience placements, activities
that the school did not previously provide, but which, as
reported in the literature, are readily available to more advan-
taged school children (Broh, 2002; Farb & Matjasko, 2012;
Stewart, Sun, Patterson, Lemerle, & Hardie, 2004).
Inclusion
Many of our team of resilience researchers and practitioners
are drawn to the field precisely because of our own challeng-
ing backgrounds. Particular attention should be paid to
explicit inclusion of marginalized people in resilience
research and practice, including involvement in the more
technical aspects of data collection. Current research prac-
tices routinely encourage underrepresentation of those termed
hardest to reach and most in need. In our own exploration of
the resilience literature, we found that children and young
people with complex needs are unjustly underrepresented in
study samples (Hart & Heaver, 2013; Hart et al., 2014). As
discussed elsewhere (Hart & Heaver, 2013; Hart et al., 2014)
the political economy of research, that is, academic capital-
ism (Barry, 2011), creates conditions which encourage
researchers to focus on tame populations, people who will sit
quietly and complete pen and paper or computer-based mea-
sures, with minimal supervision and in the fastest time.
We know that competition between researchers to present
the best value for money to funders is an issue here, having
large sample sizes and including people with learning dis-
abilities are not usually congruous, as we have found in our
own projects. Furthermore, academic journals often expect
similarly large sample sizes, so there is clearly some work to
do for both funders and journal boards in encouraging more
appropriate research participation.
Resilience researchers and practitioners should be espe-
cially concerned about underrepresentation, as it is the peo-
ple who are in most need of resilience-based interventions
who are in danger of being systematically left out of the
Hart et al. 9
knowledge base because they may need additional support to
participate. Challenging this state of affairs requires commit-
ment from individual researchers and academic institutions
to make emancipatory, resilient moves within research itself.
Although we urge researchers to strive toward the inclusion
of easy to ignore groups, and those who need additional sup-
port, there are steps that can be taken in the meantime to
create pressure for change within research contexts. We can
stop underrepresentation being a hidden problem, and
improve the validity of the information we do have, by rou-
tinely including detailed demographic information about
participants in our research. And, by justifying the use of
unrepresentative samples, we can explicitly state decision-
making processes, allowing these processes to be more care-
fully considered (Thimasarn-Anwar, Sanders, Munford,
Jones, & Liebenberg, 2014). In our own research, young
people with disabilities (physical, mental health, and learn-
ing) are integral members of our community of practice and
work as Boingboing co-researchers (Hart, Griffiths, & Mena-
Cormenzana, 2015).
Measures
The use of representative samples should be especially consid-
ered in the development of adversity and resilience measures.
If disadvantaged groups are not included when measures are
developed, this further perpetuates their exclusion from stud-
ies (Hart et al., 2014) and reduces validity. Making measures
more accessible (e.g., easy read, symbol, or pictorial format),
and ensuring they acquire information from children and
young people who have difficulty compiling forms (e.g., read
aloud or proxy completion), will aid inclusion.
Resilience-focused items should extend beyond the indi-
vidual to aspects of the person's ecology, such as the social
(e.g., family), institutional (e.g., school), and cultural and
community contexts in which they live. Adversity measures
should include questions designed to capture the types of
inequalities that the person is facing. Resilience measures
should attempt to capture emancipatory elements such as
activism and advocacy, both in relation to self and others. We
appreciate that this is hard in some contexts, but examples
include whether participants take part in political activities,
for example, voting, lobbying around inequalities, commu-
nity advocacy; or whether the resilience program they
attended had wider effects for their community, for example,
raising awareness of mental health. Finally, cost-free, easily
obtainable resilience measures are of the greatest benefit in
more disadvantaged contexts, potentially increasing inclu-
sion of disadvantaged people and communities.
Conclusion
Wider structural factors, such as political and economic
dynamics, are largely neglected in the current models,
research and practices of resilience-building for children and
young people. This is partly due to the assumption that a
focus on the individual and these wider levels is mutually
exclusive. We challenge this assumption by uniting resil-
ience research and practice development with a social justice
approach. It is essential for the advancement of the field that
researchers and practitioners acknowledge the wider politi-
cal and economic context in which both the resilience mod-
els and resulting research and practice sit. Through a social
justice lens, engagement with this wider context demands
that those of us who don't self-identify as disadvantaged take
up our role as advocates and/or promote self-advocacy
alongside disadvantaged, marginalized, and excluded chil-
dren, young people, and families.
It is essential that the resilience literature shifts debate on
to look beyond the individual. We urge scholars to work with
an inclusive and robust conceptualization of resilience that
pays attention to the individual, societal, and environmental
interactions simultaneously. We also ask researchers and
practitioners to consider how they can make resilient moves
within their own work which contribute toward systemic
transformation and the reduction of inequalities. Moreover,
working with and alongside individuals and groups facing
disadvantage will deepen researchers' and practitioners'
understanding of their needs, those that can be met and those
that cannot. Resilience research and practice has the potential
to affect the wider adversity, and therefore inequalities, con-
text with small resilient moves that set in motion chains of
events. This not only raises the profile of and strengthens day-
to-day research and practice, but it also encourages academ-
ics, practitioners, and policy makers to tackle systemic
inequalities (Aranda & Hart, 2014). Key here are the strategic
plans and daily practices of research funders. Boingboing has
been active in trying to shape these in a context where research
funding in the United Kingdom is being increasingly given
over to work on big data, with quantitative research, particu-
larly randomized controlled trials, held up as the gold stan-
dard against which all other methods are judged.
However, despite this larger picture, there is some room
for optimism. For instance, even the National Institute for
Health Research, which lauds randomized controlled trials,
has a powerful Patient and Public Involvement Agenda,
which at least in theory enables service users to lead research
projects drawing on expertise gained through their service
user identity. Elsewhere in the United Kingdom, co-produc-
tive research has been animated by the Arts and Humanities
Research Council's Connected Communities Programme. We
are involved in this through our own co-productive research
project, Imagine, and by contributing to the Connected
Communities' wider community of co-researchers, which
sees us meet regularly to share ideas and develop collabora-
tive practices (http://www.boingboing.org.uk). The Economic
and Social Research Council also takes the involvement of
people with lived experience seriously with, for example,
new initiatives being developed with recourse to service
users' experiences.
10 SAGE Open
Of course there are many miles to go with this agenda,
and we constantly challenge our own practices. Furthermore,
many aspects of the wider policy context are not favorable to
such initiatives at present. However, as we have argued
above and elsewhere, there are always practices to be found
that start in one arena and get shifted to others, including
government policy agendas. The Boingboing community of
practice approach is one such grassroots initiative that has
traveled beyond its local context and which hopes to sustain
itself for the future. Some of the practical steps we attempt to
live by are outlined below. Uniting resilience research with
an inequalities agenda is where we see our community devel-
oping and we hope that others will join us.
Practical moves that can be made in current research prac-
tice include
·
· increasing transparency of research, including a clear
conceptualization of resilience;
·
· conducting academic research that advocates for peo-
ple facing embedded societal inequalities and is
focused on challenging inequitable policy agendas;
·
· including detailed demographic information about
research participants in resilience-based initiatives;
·
· justifying the use of non-representative populations;
·
· encouraging the research community to undertake co-
produced research with underrepresented groups that
are more challenging to work with;
·
· increasing availability and accessibility of resilience
measures;
·
· developing co-produced research and practice designs,
with clear skills development pathways for all
co-researchers;
·
· engaging in co-produced research containing socially
transformative rather than solely personally transfor-
mative elements;
·
· initiating research that shares research goals, pro-
cesses, publications, and financial resources between
academic and community partners;
·
· facilitating supported agency, and co-identifying and
co-delivering responses to adversities (to address
societal inequalities, or tackle prejudice, discrimina-
tion, and stereotyping);
·
· investigating the impact of inequalities/social disad-
vantage at multiple levels on processes of resilience-
building, remembering that resilience is concerned
with overcoming adversity, while also potentially
changing or even dramatically transforming (aspects
of) that adversity;
·
· drawing on existing research in allied disciplines
(e.g., policy, health disparities, inequalities) when
designing resilience research programs to inform the
wider socio-ecological context; and
·
· taking every opportunity to influence research policy
makers and help them understand the relationship
between inequalities and resilience.

Author Biographies
Angie Hart is professor of Child, Family and Community Health at
the University of Brighton and has been working at the interface
between resilience research and practice for 10 years, including as a
child and family therapist in the National Health Service, UK. She
has been an advisor to England's Big Lottery Fund HeadStart pro-
gramme. She loosely coordinates Boingboing, a community of prac-
tice whose members have contributed to the ideas presented in this
article. Boingboing is also the name of the not for profit social enter-
prise undertaking resilience research and practice which has emerged
from the community of practice (http://www.boingboing.org.uk/),
and she is its director in a voluntary capacity. She is the academic
director of the University of Brighton's Community University
Partnership Programme. She parents three children with complex
needs adopted from the foster care system. As a result, she has per-
sonal experience of parenting using resilience-based approaches.
Emily Gagnon is a volunteer at Boingboing social enterprise and a
PhD student at the University of Sheffield. She encountered
Boingboing through her community work with another community
organization, Art in Mind, and went on to work with them, during
which time she developed an enduring interest for understanding
resilience as well as collaborative research. She continues to
develop these interests in her PhD where her research focuses on
health promotion.
Suna Eryigit-Madzwamuse is a senior research fellow at the
Centre for Health Research, University of Brighton, focusing on
promoting well-being of children/young individuals and their fami-
lies, taking into account biological and contextual risk and protec-
tive factors from a developmental perspective. She undertakes
research projects that emphasize community-university partnership
working to develop a resilient system of evidence-based commu-
nity support for children and young individuals with life challenges.
She is a volunteer for Boingboing, contributing to research and
practice development.
Josh Cameron is a principal lecturer in Occupational Therapy at
the University of Brighton. He has undertaken research on the
return-to-work experiences of workers with mental health prob-
lems. He collaborates with Boingboing in adapting and developing
resilience practice and research for use with adults, combining the
expertise and knowledge of people with lived experience, practitio-
ners, and academics. He is also a Boingboing volunteer.
Kay Aranda is a reader at the University of Brighton. Her profes-
sional background is nursing and community nursing, having
worked and researched in the National Health Service in primary
care and in the voluntary sector in women's health. She has led
courses in community specialist practice and advanced practice and
currently teaches sociology, policy, and qualitative research. Her
academic background is in the social sciences, including the sociol-
ogy of health and illness. Her theoretical interests are in feminism,
discourse, subjectivity and identity, and equality and difference.
Anne Rathbone is a PhD student at the University of Brighton, and
senior training and consultancy manager specializing in co-produc-
tion at Boingboing. Her PhD research involves working with young
people with learning disabilities as co-researchers to explore their
own experiences of resilience--what is helpful and what is not--
and undertaking self-directed collective action to challenge the
adversities they face. The research, in partnership with Arts Connect
(part of Culture Shift) in East Sussex, focuses on the use of arts-
based activities to facilitate exploration of resilience issues and as a
way of presenting findings.
Becky Heaver is a research officer in the Centre for Health
Research at the University of Brighton. Her PhD is in psychology,
and she now researches resilience in relation to children, young
people, and families, using methods including participatory
research, literature reviews, and communities of practice. Her
research interests also include psychophysiology, recognition
memory, self-advocacy, and Asperger syndrome. She is a volunteer
for Boingboing, developing an online network via the website and
social media.
