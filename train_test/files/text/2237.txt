Context: Although suicide is the third leading cause of
death among US adolescents, little is known about the
prevalence, correlates, or treatment of its immediate pre-
cursors, adolescent suicidal behaviors (ie, suicide ide-
ation, plans, and attempts).
Objectives: To estimate the lifetime prevalence of sui-
cidal behaviors among US adolescents and the associa-
tions of retrospectively reported, temporally primary
DSM-IV disorders with the subsequent onset of suicidal
behaviors.
Design: Dual-frame national sample of adolescents from
the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adoles-
cent Supplement.
Setting: Face-to-face household interviews with ado-
lescents and questionnaires for parents.
Participants: A total of 6483 adolescents 13 to 18 years
of age and their parents.
Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime suicide ideation,
plans, and attempts.
Results: The estimated lifetime prevalences of suicide
ideation, plans, and attempts among the respondents are
12.1%, 4.0%, and 4.1%, respectively. The vast majority
of adolescents with these behaviors meet lifetime crite-
ria for at least one DSM-IV mental disorder assessed in
the survey. Most temporally primary (based on retro-
spective age-of-onset reports) fear/anger, distress, dis-
ruptive behavior, and substance disorders significantly
predict elevated odds of subsequent suicidal behaviors
in bivariate models. The most consistently significant as-
sociations of these disorders are with suicide ideation,
although a number of disorders are also predictors of plans
and both planned and unplanned attempts among ide-
ators. Most suicidal adolescents (80%) receive some
form of mental health treatment. In most cases (55%),
treatment starts prior to onset of suicidal behaviors but
fails to prevent these behaviors from occurring.
Conclusions: Suicidal behaviors are common among US
adolescents, with rates that approach those of adults. The
vast majority of youth with suicidal behaviors have pre-
existing mental disorders. The disorders most power-
fully predicting ideation, though, are different from those
most powerfully predicting conditional transitions from
ideation to plans and attempts. These differences sug-
gest that distinct prediction and prevention strategies are
needed for ideation, plans among ideators, planned at-
tempts, and unplanned attempts.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS ARE
among the leading causes of
death worldwide, especially
among adolescents and
young adults.1-4 Despite the
scope and seriousness of the problem, rela-
tively little is known about the preva-
lence, correlates, or treatment of suicidal
behavior (ie, suicide ideation, plans, and
attempts) among US adolescents because
nationally representative studies of this
problem are rare. Although some prior
studies have reported on these aspects of
adolescent suicidal behavior5-8 and
death,9-11 virtually all of them were based
on small regional samples, limiting the
generality of findings and precluding fine-
grained analyses. Comprehensive na-
tional data on suicidal behavior among
adolescents are needed to improve our
understanding of the nature of this per-
plexing and devastating problem, to arm
clinicians with information about risk
profiles, and to help inform decisions about
promising prevention targets.

Our report presents data on the epidemiology of ado-
lescent nonlethal suicidal behaviors from the National
Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supple-
ment (NCS-A), the first national survey of US adoles-
cents to assess a wide range of DSM-IV mental disorders
and suicidal behaviors using fully-structured diagnostic
interviews. Several recent studies have reported on
the NCS-A design,12,13 measures,14,15 the lifetime and
12-month prevalence of mental disorders,16-18 and 12-
month prevalence and treatment of suicidal behav-
iors.19 Here, we present new data on lifetime prevalence
and age at onset of suicidal behaviors, as well as infor-
mation on correlations with temporally primary mental
disorders and treatment.
METHOD
SAMPLE
The NCS-A is a survey of 10 148 adolescents (13-17 years of
age at the time of selection, although some respondents turned
18 years before their interview) in the continental United States
completed in conjunction with the National Comorbidity Sur-
vey Replication.20 The design and field procedures of this study
are reported in detail elsewhere.12-15 The NCS-A used a dual-
frame sample composed of (1) a household subsample of ado-
lescents (n=904) selected from the National Comorbidity Sur-
vey Replication households and (2) a school subsample of
adolescents (n=9244) selected from schools (day and residen-
tial schools of all types, with probabilities proportional to size)
in the same nationally representative counties as those in the
National Comorbidity Survey Replication. The overall re-
sponse rate was 82.9%.
One parent or parent surrogate (subsequently referred to as
"parents") of each adolescent provided written informed con-
sent, and the adolescents provided written informed assent be-
fore adolescent interviews. Parents also completed self-
administeredquestionnairesabouttheadolescent'smentalhealth.
The self-administered questionnaire response rate was in the
range of 82.5% to 83.7% in the household-school samples. Our
report focuses on the 6483 adolescent-parent pairs with com-
plete data. The use of this subsample reduces the precision of
the estimates compared with analyses based on the full sample,
but it eliminates the bias introduced by having missing parent
reports on adolescent disorders.
Each parent and adolescent was paid $50 for participating
in the study. All study procedures were approved by the hu-
man subjects committees of Harvard Medical School in Bos-
ton,Massachusetts,andtheUniversityofMichiganatAnnArbor.
Completed cases were weighted for within-household prob-
ability of selection (for the household subsample) and residual
discrepancies between sample and population on demographic-
geographic variables. Weighting procedures are described
elsewhere.12,13 Adolescents in the weighted NCS-A parent-
adolescent sample are very similar to the population of US ado-
lescents on a wide range of sociodemographic/geographic
variables.12,13
MEASURES
Suicidal Behaviors
Suicidal behaviors were assessed using a modified version of
the Suicidal Behavior Module of the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).21,22 This module assesses the life-
time occurrence and age at onset of suicide ideation ("You se-
riously thought about killing yourself") and, among respon-
dents who reported lifetime ideation, suicide plans ("You made
a plan for killing yourself") and suicide attempts ("You tried
to kill yourself"). To examine transitions among behaviors, we
focus on not only predictors of lifetime suicide attempts but
also predictors of lifetime suicide ideation, lifetime suicide plans
among ideators, and lifetime attempts among ideators with and
without a plan.
DSM-IV Mental Disorders
All adolescents completed a modified version of the World
Health Organization CIDI, a fully-structured diagnostic inter-
view administered by trained lay interviewers16,21 modified for
administration to adolescents.15 The disorders examined were
organized into 4 broad categories based on the results of an ex-
ploratory factor analysis reported elsewhere23: fear and anger
disorders (panic disorder and/or agoraphobia, specific pho-
bia, social phobia, and intermittent explosive disorder [IED]),
distress disorders (separation anxiety disorder [SAD], post-
traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder and/or dys-
thymia [MDD/DYS], and generalized anxiety disorder), dis-
ruptive behavior disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and
eating disorders [including anorexia nervosa, bulimia ner-
vosa, and binge-eating disorder]), and substance abuse (alco-
hol and illicit drug abuse). We also assessed bipolar disorder
(I or II). Parent reports were also obtained and were com-
bined with adolescent reports to derive DSM-IV diagnoses for
the 4 disorders shown in prior research to benefit most from
inclusion of parental reports: MDD/DYS, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and con-
duct disorder.24,25 Adolescent and parent reports were com-
bined using an "or" rule at the symptom level. An NCS-A clinical
reappraisal study14 showed good concordance between diag-
noses based on the CIDI and self-administered questionnaire
and independent clinical diagnoses in a subsample of NCS-A
parent-adolescent pairs based on blinded administration of the
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-
Age Children, Present and Lifetime Version.14,26
Sociodemographic Variables
A number of sociodemographic variables were assessed using
the CIDI: sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other), parental education (less
than a high school degree, a high school degree or General Edu-
cation Development credential, some postsecondary educa-
tion, or a college degree), birth order (first, last, and other),
number of siblings (0, 1, 2, or 3), and number of biological
parents living with the adolescent (0, 1, or 2). Information was
collected in the surveys to date the transitions in time-varying
variables (eg, respondent's age at birth of siblings and at pa-
rental death or divorce), allowing us to redefine these vari-
ables for each year of the respondent's life as time-varying pre-
dictors of onset of suicidality.
Treatment
Lifetime history of treatment for emotional or behavioral prob-
lems was assessed using questions from the Service Assess-
ment for Children and Adolescents.27,28 The entry question asked
respondents whether they (for adolescent self-reports) or their
child (for parent reports) ever "received services" for prob-
lems with "emotions or behavior" or "alcohol or drug use" from
each of 11 different types of professionals or settings. Re-

sponses were collapsed into 6 treatment sectors: (1) mental
health specialty (eg, psychiatrist or psychologist); (2) general
medical (eg, primary care physician, nurse, or pediatrician);
(3) human services (eg, counselor, crisis hotline, or religious/
spiritual advisor); (4) complementary-alternative medicine (eg,
self-help group, support group, or other healer); (5) juvenile
justice (eg, probation or juvenile corrections officer or court
counselor); and (6) school services (eg, special school for emo-
tional/behavioral problems, school counseling, or school nurse).
No information was obtained about the content of the "ser-
vices" received, which means that the characterization of ser-
vices as "treatment" can be called into question with regard to
human services, juvenile justice, and school services.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Cross-tabulations were used to estimate the lifetime prevalence
of suicidal behaviors, mental disorders, and treatment. Discrete-
time survival analysis, with person-year the unit of analysis and
a logistic link function, was used to examine associations of tem-
porallyprimary(basedonretrospectiveage-at-onsetreports)men-
tal disorders and subsequent first onset of suicidality.29 Time was
modeled as a separate dummy predictor variable for each year
oflifeuptoageatintervieworageatonsetoftheoutcome,which-
ever came first. Survival coefficients and their standard errors
were exponentiated and reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
CIs. The results of both bivariate and multivariate models are
reported to provide information on both gross and net associa-
tions of disorders with suicidal behaviors.
Multivariate survival models either assumed additivity (in
predicting logits) or included nonadditive associations among
comorbid mental disorders. The latter models included a sepa-
rate dummy predictor variable for each disorder ("type dum-
mies") and dummy predictor variables for number of disor-
ders ("number dummies"). Relative odds of suicidal behaviors
associated with a given comorbid cluster (compared with re-
spondents with no disorders) correspond to the product of the
type dummies and the number dummy for the respondent's
number of disorders. For example, the relative odds of sui-
cidal behaviors among respondents with a given set of 3 co-
morbid disorders would be the product of the 3 ORs for those
particular disorders multiplied by the 3-disorder number
dummy, where the latter was assumed to be constant for all
respondents with any combination of exactly 3 or more co-
morbid disorders. This means that the ORs associated with the
number dummies can be interpreted as multiplicative devia-
tions from the associations of comorbid disorder clusters with
the outcomes expected based on an additive model (ie, a model
with type dummies but no number dummies).30
The Taylor series method31 was used to estimate standard
errors in the SUDAAN software system,32 to adjust for sample
weighting and clustering. Multivariate significance was exam-
ined using Wald 2 tests based on design-corrected coefficient
variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance was con-
sistently evaluated using 2-sided tests with an  level of .05.
Individually significant coefficients were interpreted only if the
equation in which they were estimated was significant as a whole
in a multivariate test, an approach that minimizes the problem
of false positives due to multiple comparisons while avoiding
the problem of low power to detect true associations of mod-
erate magnitude that is introduced by more conservative meth-
ods (eg, Bonferroni corrections).33 Model comparisons were
made using the Akaike information criterion.34
RESULTS
PREVALENCE AND AGE
AT ONSET OF SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS
The lifetime prevalences of suicide ideation, plans, and
attempts are 12.1%, 4.0%, and 4.1%, respectively
(Table 1). One-third (33.4%) of ideators go on to de-
velop a suicide plan, and 33.9% make an attempt. The
proportions of ideators who go on to make an attempt
are 60.8% of those with a plan compared with 20.4% of
those without a plan, resulting in roughly 60% of first
attempts being planned (57% among boys and 66% among
girls) and the other 40% unplanned. All of these preva-
lence estimates are higher among girls than boys, with
the exception of the proportion of ideators who go on to
develop a plan and the proportion of attempts that are
planned vs unplanned.
Age-at-onset curves show that the lifetime preva-
lence of suicide ideation is very low (1%) through 10
years of age, then increases slowly through 12 years of
age, and then more rapidly between 12 and 17 years of
age (Figure 1). The prevalence of plans and attempts,
in comparison, remains very low (1%) through 12
years of age, then increases in roughly linear fashion
through 15 years of age, and then more slowly until 17
years of age. Speed-of-transition curves show that the
vast majority of adolescent transitions from ideation to
plan (63.1%) and from ideation to attempt (86.1%)
occur within the first year of onset of ideation
(Figure 2). The vast majority (88.4%) of adolescent
transitions from plan to attempt occur within the year
of developing the plan.

SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES
Girls have significantly elevated odds of lifetime sui-
cide ideation (OR = 1.7) and attempt (OR = 2.9) and,
among ideators, of making an unplanned attempt
(OR = 3.7), but they do not differ significantly from
boys in either the transition from ideation to a plan
(OR = 1.0) or the transition from plan to attempt
(OR = 1.7) (Table 2). Non-Hispanic blacks have sig-
nificantly lower odds of attempts (OR = 0.3) than do
non-Hispanic whites, which can be traced to signifi-
cantly lower odds of ideation (OR = 0.5) in conjunc-
tion with insignificantly lower conditional odds of
plans among ideators (OR = 0.7) and attempts among
both planners (OR = 0.4) and ideators without a plan
(OR = 0.4). Hispanics and other race/ethnic groups, in
comparison, do not differ significantly from non-
Hispanic whites with regard to any of these odds.
The odds of an attempt are elevated among youths
with a parent who graduated from high school (OR = 2.0)
or completed some college (OR = 3.0) compared
with those with a parent with either more (ie, college
graduates) or less (ie, did not graduate from high school)
education. These associations are due to significantly el-
evated odds of ideation among respondents whose par-
ents have had some college education (OR = 1.4), non-
significantly elevated conditional odds of a plan (OR = 1.9-
2.0) and a planned attempt (OR = 1.3-1.4) among
respondents whose parents completed high school or
some college, and elevated odds of an unplanned at-
tempt (significant only for the offspring of parents
with some college education) in these 2 subsamples. Birth
order and number of siblings are related only to one as-
pect of suicidality: significantly reduced odds of an un-
planned attempt among the youngest children and those
with 2 or more siblings (OR = 0.1). Finally, a significant
relationship exists between living with 0 (OR = 4.1) or
1 parent (OR = 2.0) vs both biological parents and sui-
cide attempt due to significantly elevated odds of ide-
ation (OR = 2.8-1.8) and, among youth living with no bio-
logical parents, of both planned (OR = 6.2) and unplanned
(OR = 3.7) attempts.
PREVALENCE OF MENTAL DISORDERS AMONG
ADOLESCENTS WITH SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS
The vast majority of adolescents with a lifetime history
of suicide ideation (89.3%) and attempts (96.1%) meet
lifetime criteria for at least 1 of the 15 DSM-IV/CIDI dis-
orders considered (Table 3). The prevalence of each dis-
order is elevated in virtually all subsamples of youths with
suicidal behaviors, with 78.7% of these differences sta-
tistically significant at an  level of .05. The most preva-
lent lifetime disorder among suicidal adolescents is MDD/
DYS, followed by specific phobia, oppositional defiant
disorder, IED, substance abuse, and conduct disorder.
The prevalence of mental disorders generally increases
with increasing severity of suicidal behaviors (ie, sui-
cide ideation  suicide plan  suicide attempt), al-
though SAD shows the opposite pattern.
ASSOCIATIONS OF TEMPORALLY PRIMARY
LIFETIME MENTAL DISORDERS
WITH SUICIDE ATTEMPTS
Discrete-time survival analysis was used to examine as-
sociations of temporally primary lifetime mental disor-
ders with the subsequent first onset of a suicide at-
tempt. The results of bivariate models (ie, including only
one disorder at a time) suggest that 13 of the 15 lifetime
DSM-IV disorders examined are associated with signifi-
cantly elevated odds of a subsequent suicide attempt
(Table 4). Panic/agoraphobia and SAD are the excep-
tions. Significant ORs range from 4.5 to 7.4 for disrup-
tive behavior disorders, from 4.1 to 12.3 for distress dis-
orders, from 2.8 to 4.8 for substance disorders, and from
2.5 to 3.5 for fear/anger disorders. The OR for bipolar
disorder is 8.8. The ORs become smaller in an additive
multivariate survival model that includes all 15 mental
disorders as predictors. The only significant positive pre-

dictors of suicide attempt in this additive model are post-
traumatic stress disorder (OR = 3.3), MDD/DYS
(OR = 6.2), oppositional defiant disorder (OR = 2.1), eat-
ing disorder (OR = 3.2), and bipolar disorder (OR = 2.9).
Interestingly, there is a significant protective effect for
SAD (OR = 0.3).
The additive multivariate survival model implicitly
assumes that the odds of a suicide attempt among
respondents with comorbid disorders will equal the
product of the ORs associated with individual disorders.
However, a nonadditive model that includes additional
number-of-disorder dummies for exactly 2 and 3 or
more disorders fits the observed data better than the
additive model (Akaike information criterion of 2354.8
for the additive model and of 2340.4 for the nonadditive
model, with the preferred model being the one with the
lower Akaike information criterion) (Table 5). A com-
parison of coefficients in the 2 models shows that 5
of the same 6 disorders are significant, but with positive
ORs consistently lower in the nonadditive model
because the odds of an attempted suicide are 1.5 times
the product of the ORs of the component disorders
among respondents with 2 comorbid disorders and 3.4
times that product among respondents with 3 or more
comorbid disorders.
We used the same nonadditive model to predict life-
time ideation in the total sample and lifetime plans and
attempts among ideators, in an effort to decompose the
associations of temporally prior mental disorders with sui-
cide attempts through the more proximal outcomes. The
results show that prior mental disorders are most strongly
associated with suicide ideation (12 disorders have ORs

greater than 1.0 [7 of them significant], and the ORs of co-
morbidity are significantly greater than 1.0). Condi-
tional associations of mental disorders with suicide plans
among ideators are weaker and less consistent (6 disor-
ders have ORs greater than 1.0 [1 of them significant],
but with the OR for illicit drug abuse significantly less
than 1.0). Conditional associations of mental disorders
with attempts among ideators, controlling for plans, are
somewhat weaker and less consistent than with plans (9
disorders have ORs greater than 1.0 [3 of them signifi-
cant], but with the OR for alcohol abuse significantly less
than 1.0). Having a plan, in comparison, is strongly as-
sociated with elevated odds of an attempt among ide-
ators (OR = 5.3).
We also found that significant global interactions be-
tween type/number of disorders and plans were predic-
tors of attempts among ideators (2
17
= 65.0, P  .001).
However, the multicollinearity due to high comorbidity
among respondents with suicide plans made it impos-
sible to estimate a model with all 17 type/number coeffi-
cients separately for ideators with and without a plan. We
were able to estimate a stable model, though, by constrain-
ing ORs for particular types/numbers of disorders to be
the same in predicting both planned and unplanned at-
tempts unless the interaction of the predictor with plans
in the pooled model was significant at the  level of .05
and had an estimated variance inflation factor (a diagnos-
tic test suggesting that a regression coefficient might be
affected by multicollinearity) of less than 10.0. The final
model, constrained in this way, included the interactions
of 3 disorders with plans: IED, SAD, and conduct disor-
der. This model fits the data better than a model with no
interactions between disorders and plans (an Akaike in-
formation criterion of 1041.9 for the model with interac-
tions vs an Akaike information criterion of 1083.6 with-
out interactions). Only half of the 12 disorders with the
same ORs predicting planned and unplanned attempts are
greater than 1.0, of which 2 are significant (OR = 2.5 for at-
tention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and OR = 5.3 for eat-
ing disorders), and one other OR is significantly less than
1.0 (OR = 0.3 for alcohol abuse). Two of the 3 disorders
with ORs that differ in predicting planned and un-
planned attempts are significant only in predicting planned
attempts (OR = 4.2 for IED and OR = 0.1 for SAD). The
other is significant only in predicting unplanned at-
tempts (OR = 8.0 for conduct disorder).
It is instructive to trace out the significant associations
of type/number of disorders with suicide attempts in the
total sample through more proximal outcomes (ie, ide-
ation, plans among ideators, and attempts among ide-
atorswithorwithoutaplan).All4ofthedisorderswithsig-
nificant ORs greater than 1.0 predicting suicide attempt
in the total sample (posttraumatic stress disorder, MDD/
DYS, eating disorders, and bipolar disorder) have signifi-
cant ORs predicting ideation (1.7-4.1). This is the only sig-
nificant OR for 2 of these 4 disorders (posttraumatic stress

disorder and bipolar disorder), although the ORs of these
disorders with other intermediate outcomes are all el-
evated (1.2-2.2). In the case of MDD/DYS, in compari-
son, most of the ORs with intermediate outcomes are also
significantly greater than 1.0, although the OR with ide-
ation (4.1) is higher than the ORs with the intermediate
outcomes (all of which are in the range of 2.0-2.4). In the
case of eating disorders, the OR predicting ideation is sig-
nificantly elevated (1.5), the OR predicting a plan among
ideators is insignificant (0.6), and the OR predicting an
attempt among ideators, controlling for a plan, is signifi-
cantly elevated (4.5). The only significant component OR
in the case of SAD, the one disorder associated with sig-
nificantly reduced odds of a suicide attempt in the total
sample (0.3), is with attempt among planners (0.1). Fi-
nally, the elevated ORs of comorbidity with suicide at-
tempts in the total sample are due to significant ORs
with ideation (1.9) and insignificantly elevated ORs with a
plan among ideators (1.5-2.3).
TREATMENT OF SUICIDAL ADOLESCENTS
Most adolescents with suicide ideation (80.2%), a plan
(87.5%), or an attempt (94.2%) have received some form
of treatment, although it is important to remember the
caution raised in the section on measures that some pro-
portion of the "services" received in the human ser-
vices, juvenile justice, and school services sectors might
not have qualified as "treatment" (Table 6). The most
common form of treatment was from a mental health spe-
cialist (66.4%-86.2% across outcomes), followed by
school-based services (40.6%-68.0%), general medical
treatment (25.8%-41.1%), human services (21.1%-
40.2%), complementary-alternative medicine (17.3%-
25.1%), and the juvenile justice system (10.2%-17.7%).
We next examined whether lifetime treatment was first
received before the year the adolescent first experienced
each type of suicidal behavior, the same year, or only af-
ter the first instance of suicidal behavior. These analy-
ses reveal that most suicidal adolescents (55.3%-73.2%
across outcomes) receive some form of treatment before
the onset of suicidal behavior--most often mental health
or school-based services. The prevalence of first receiv-
ing treatment is substantially lower during the same year
as the onset of suicidal behavior (10.8%-18.2%) and in the
years following the first instance of suicidal behavior
(8.1%-12.4%).
COMMENT
Our study presented nationally representative data on the
lifetime prevalence, correlates, and treatment of adoles-
cent suicidal behaviors. We estimate that 12.1% of US
adolescents experience suicide ideation, 4.0% develop a
suicide plan, and 4.1% attempt suicide. These estimates
are consistent with those reported in prior studies using
smaller samples.1-3 Nationally representative studies of
adults have reported that the first onset of suicidal be-
haviors increases dramatically during adolescence.35 The
present study provides a more fine-grained picture of these
increases and extends prior studies in documenting that
approximately one-third of youth with suicide ideation
go on to develop a suicide plan during adolescence, ap-
proximately 60% of those with a plan will attempt sui-
cide, and most of the adolescents who make this transi-
tion do so within the first year after onset. This information
is important not only for a scientific understanding of
suicidal behaviors but for the monitoring of risk among
suicidal adolescents and for public health efforts to iden-
tify those at risk for attempting suicide. These findings
also inform the debate about the use of suicide ideation
as a surrogate end point in clinical trials36 and argue
strongly for the close monitoring of adolescents with a
suicide plan, especially during the first year of onset.
The elevated odds of suicidal behavior among girls and
the lower odds among non-Hispanic blacks are consis-
tent with prior studies.1,3,7,37 It is well documented that,
although females have higher rates of nonlethal suicidal
behavior, males have higher rates of suicide death--a dif-
ference due in part to the more lethal methods used by
males in their suicide attempts (eg, firearms). We also ob-

served elevated odds of suicidal behavior among adoles-
cents whose parents had intermediate levels of education
and lower odds of suicidal behavior among those living
with biological parents and having more siblings. These
latter 2 findings, also consistent with previous re-
ports,11,38,39 might reflect the influences of social support,
which acts as a buffer against stress or psychopathology,
or might be a marker of low exposure to adversity and/or
low genetic risk.
Our study also provides new information about the
associations of temporally primary mental disorders with
subsequent adolescent suicidal behaviors.1,5,6,8,9 The rates
of prior mental disorders among suicidal adolescents
found in our study are somewhat higher than the rates
found in previous community studies of adolescents1-3
and adults,40 possibly reflecting the fact that the NCS-A
examined more disorders than previous studies. Al-
though virtually all of the mental disorders examined were
predictors of a suicide attempt in bivariate models, these
associations were largely explained by mental disorders
as predictors of suicide ideation. Among adolescents with
ideation, only MDD/dysthymia predicted the develop-
ment of a suicide plan, and only a handful of disorders
were predictors of the transition from ideation to a sui-
cide attempt (ie, MDD/dysthymia, eating disorders, at-
tention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder
[only for unplanned attempt] and IED [only for planned
attempt]). These findings are consistent with recent find-
ings in epidemiological studies of adults, in which MDD
emerged as the strongest predictor of suicidal thoughts
compared with disorders characterized by anxiety, agi-
tation, and poor behavioral control, which were the stron-
gest predictors of a suicide attempt among ideators.22,40
Several of the findings raise questions that require fur-
ther study and theorizing. Our finding that IED is a pre-
dictor of only planned, not unplanned, suicide attempts

bA dummy predictor variable for having a plan was included in both models. In the model that merely controlled for plan, this was the only additional predictor,
which means that it was implicitly assumed that the odds ratios of temporally primary disorders predicting a subsequent attempt were the same for planned and
unplanned attempts. In the model that also included interactions, subgroup coding was used to estimate odds ratios of disorders separately with planned and
unplanned attempts for the subset of disorders in which the difference between these 2 odds ratios was found to be statistically significant and stable.

is surprising given the impulsive nature of IED. Nota-
bly, though, we observed this same pattern in 2 prior stud-
ies,22,40 which suggests that it is not merely a chance find-
ing in the present study. Future research is needed to study
this association in more depth in the context of a broader
investigation of the roles of impulsiveness and planning
in suicidal behaviors. Another interesting finding was that
SAD was associated with consistently low odds of all sub-
sequent suicidal behaviors (and significantly so for
planned suicide attempts). Although speculative, it may
be that adolescents who fear leaving their parents are less
likely to act on suicidal thoughts and plans for fear of
losing them. Prior studies have found that anxiety dis-
orders protect against oppositional/aggressive behav-
ior.41 A similar process might exist for suicidal behav-
ior. Nevertheless, given the large number of coefficients
examined, the significant association of SAD with re-
duced odds of a suicide attempt among planners should
be considered no more than provisional until replicated
in independent samples.
Several aspects of the results regarding treatment are
especially noteworthy. The fact that most suicidal ado-
lescents who receive treatment see a mental health spe-
cialist suggests that these adolescents are getting access
to those most qualified to treat them. In addition, the fact
that the proportion of adolescents in treatment in-
creases with severity (ie, from ideation to having a plan
to attempting suicide) implies that the treatment sys-
tem is responsive to variation in severity. However, it is
noteworthy that suicidal adolescents typically enter treat-
ment before rather than after the onset of suicidal be-
haviors. This means that mental health professionals are
not simply meeting with adolescents in response to their
suicidal thoughts or behaviors, but that adolescents who
are clinically severe enough to become suicidal more typi-
cally enter treatment before the onset of suicidal behav-
iors. There is no way to know from the NCS-A data how
often this early intervention prevents the occurrence of
suicidal behaviors that would otherwise have occurred
but were not observed in our data. It is clear, though, that

treatment does not always succeed in this way because
the adolescents in the NCS-A who received treatment prior
to their first attempt went on to make an attempt any-
way. This finding is consistent with recent data high-
lighting the difficulty of reducing suicidal thoughts and
behaviors among adolescents.42 We are unaware of any
prior epidemiologic data on the lifetime treatment of sui-
cidal adolescents, so there is no basis for comparison of
our findings with those of previous studies. However, a
recent report found that the rate of 12-month treatment
of adults with suicidal behavior in 21 countries aver-
aged 40% and was higher in the United States
(63%-82%).43,44 The slightly higher rate of treatment ob-
served in the present study than in these adult studies
reflects the fact that we examined lifetime treatment rather
than 12-month treatment and that the prevalence of men-
tal disorders among those with suicidal behaviors, which
is associated with increased probability of treatment,45
was higher in the NCS-A than in the other studies.
These findings should be interpreted in light of several
limitations. First, the results are based on retrospective
self-reports that may be subject to recall bias. Second, men-
tal disorders were assessed with a fully-structured in-
strument rather than by clinical assessment, although this
limitation is tempered somewhat by the good concor-
dance between survey diagnoses and blinded clinical
diagnoses.14 Third, several disorders known to be asso-
ciated with suicidal behavior were not examined (eg,
schizophrenia and personality disorders). Fourth, some
of the disorders that were found to be significant are likely
to have been false positives owing to the large number of
tests performed. Consequently, regarding these associa-
tions, it is important to consider the results to be provi-
sional until they are replicated. Fifth, we examined only
a limited set of predictors. For example, we did not con-
sider health risk behaviors, protective factors, or family-
community predictors. Sixth, we focused only on onset
of suicidal behaviors and did not examine either severity
or persistence or inquire specifically about intent to die.
Seventh, we did not validate reports of treatment, nor did
we examine the adequacy of treatment. These limita-
tions notwithstanding, our study provides valuable new
information about suicidal behaviors among adoles-
cents. The results point to the need for future work to
increase our understanding of the dramatic increase in
suicidal behaviors during adolescence, of the causal path-
ways linking child-adolescent mental disorders to ado-
lescent suicidal behaviors, and of actionable strategies for
clinical prediction and prevention of these behaviors.
