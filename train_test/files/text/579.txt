height and weight in wave 1 of the Add
Health study

Abstract
Background: Bias in adolescent self-reported height and weight is well documented. Given the importance and
widespread use of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) data for obesity
research, we developed and tested the feasibility and validity of an empirically derived statistical correction for self-
report bias in wave 1 (W1) of Add Health, a large panel study in the United States.
Methods: Participants in grades 7­12 with complete height and weight data at W1 were included (n = 20,175). We
used measured and self-reported (SR) height and weight and relevant biopsychosocial factors from wave 2 (W2) of
Add Health (n = 14,190) to identify sources of bias and derive the most efficient sex-specific estimates of corrected
height and weight. Measured, SR, and corrected W2 BMI values were calculated and compared, including sensitivity
and specificity. Final correction equations were applied to W1.
Results: After correction, weight status misclassification rates among those who underestimated their weight status
were reduced from 6.6 to 5.7 % for males and from 8.0 to 5.6 % for females compared to self-report; and the
correlation between SR and measured BMI in W2 increased slightly from 0.92 to 0.93. Among females, correction
procedures resulted in a 3.4 % increase in sensitivity to detect overweight/obesity (BMI  25) and 5.9 % increase in
sensitivity for obesity (BMI  30).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that application of the proposed statistical corrections can reduce bias of self-report
height and weight in W1 of the Add Health data and may be useful in some analyses. In particular, the corrected
BMI values improve sensitivity ­the ability to detect a true positive--for overweight/obesity among females, which
addresses a major concern about self-report bias in obesity research. However, the correction does not improve
sensitivity to identify underweight or healthy weight adolescents and so should be applied selectively based on
research questions.

Background
As a simple ratio of weight to height (kg/m2), body mass
index (BMI) is a cost-effective and widely used metric
for assessing overweight and obesity [1], despite its limi-
tations as an indicator of excess adiposity or cardiometa-
bolic risk for disease [2]. Self-reported (SR) height and
weight are often used in population surveys when direct
measurement is cost prohibitive, or when obesity is not
the primary focus of study, and have been found to have
acceptable validity [3]. However, concerns about the val-
idity of self-reported height and weight among adoles-
cents remain, especially when BMI and weight status are
the main outcomes of interest. Researchers have consist-
ently noted that SR height and weight lead to underre-
porting of obesity prevalence [4­6].
Objective measurement of height and weight using a
standardized protocol is more reliable than self-report
and should be incorporated in study designs whenever
possible [5]. However, large cohort studies that began
data collection prior to the rapid rise in obesity ­and
that have since increased the rigor of biometric
measurement ­ often contain information not available
elsewhere. An example of valuable self-reported height
and weight data is in the first wave of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add
Health). Add Health is the largest on-going national co-
hort study of adolescents originally enrolled in US public
schools in 1995­1996 (n = 20,774) [7]. It offers a rich
source of information and potential knowledge about
psychosocial and biological risk and resilience related to
weight trajectories, weight loss behaviors, obesity, car-
diovascular health, diabetes risk, and metabolic syn-
drome. Although both measured and self-reported data
were collected in Waves 2, 3, and 4, Wave 1 (W1) con-
tains only self-reported height and weight data. This
limitation has plagued obesity researchers because of the
pressing need for longitudinal analyses of these types of
unique cohort data collected prior to the rapid rise in
obesity in the US. The foresight of the Add Health study
team to begin collecting measured height and weight in
W2, and yet to also continue collecting self-reported data
for comparisons, provide unique opportunities to study
the relationship between measured and self-reported
height and weight that have not yet been fully exploited.
Several prior studies have examined the validity of
self-reported height and weight in the Add Health data
[3, 8] but none have proposed a statistical correction.
For example, using W2 of the Add Health data, Goodman
and colleagues found a high correlation between self-
report and measured weight (r = .95), height (r = .94), and
BMI (r = .92; p < .0005 for all) and the study concluded
that self-report height and weight in W1 of the Add
Health data were sufficiently valid [3]. Although it found
that girls underestimated their weight by an average of
1.02 kg (2.2 pounds) and boys by .19 kg (.4 pounds), no
particular recommendations for a statistical adjustment to
correct for the observed self-report bias were made at that
time [3]. In contrast, statistical corrections of SR bias have
been recommended [9] and widely disseminated for many
other adolescent data sets [10­12].
Additionally, the high average correlation between
self-report and measured BMI among a large sample of
adolescents may be falsely reassuring ­ it may cover up
validity issues among known subgroups for whom the
correlations between measured and self-report data are
higher or lower than average. For example, numerous
studies have found that overall, self-report tends to over-
estimate height and underestimate weight relative to
measured values, and weight underestimation is highest
among those with overweight or obesity [1, 4, 9]. Given
the increasing public health importance of the Add
Health data as a source of characterizing obesity trajec-
tories and risk factors over time and the value of using
all waves of available data, identifying and testing statis-
tical correction equations for reducing self-report height
and weight bias in W1 of Add Health would enable re-
searchers to determine if and under what conditions it
may be warranted to apply a correction.
Purpose of study
We sought to examine the feasibility and validity of a
proposed statistical adjustment to correct or mitigate
bias in self-reported height and weight in a large, widely
used nationally representative panel study of adolescents
in the US. Specifically, this study aimed to adjust statisti-
cally for the self-report bias in W1 BMI, based on empir-
ical knowledge of the relationship between self-reported
and measured BMI at W2. Candidate predictors in-
cluded demographic, biometric, and psychosocial vari-
ables. First (H1), we hypothesized that by using
measured and self-reported (SR) height and weight and
a wide range of relevant background in wave 2 (W2), it
will be feasible to identify efficient regression models to
predict measured height and weight at W2 from self-
reported values at W2 for males and females.
Second (H2), we hypothesized that the corrected
height and weight values at W2 will provide a better es-
timate of true (i.e., measured) height and weight than SR
data alone. Third (H3), when corrected height and
weight values are used to calculate BMI percentiles and
classify cases by weight status, this will result in a lower
rate of misclassification of weight status classification
than would SR data alone in W2 among those who
underestimated their weight status. Finally, the correc-
tion procedures developed from W2 can then be applied
to SR height and weight in W1 to generate corrected
height, weight, BMI, and weight status at W1. The pro-
posed corrections (H4) are expected to reduce bias in

SR height and weight and if so, will mitigate the obesity
underreporting bias from self-report that has been docu-
mented in the literature.
Methods
Data and participants
We used Wave 1 (W1) and Wave 2 (W2) of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health,
n = 20,745) [13]. Data were collected in 1994-5 (W1)
and 1996 (W2; n = 14,738); two additional waves of data
were collected in 2001­2002 and 2007­2008. Participants
were in grades 7­12 at W1. In order to maximize the util-
ity of the proposed procedure for a wide range of Add
Health data users, as few exclusion criteria as possible
were applied. Participants with complete height and
weight data in W1 (n = 20,175) as well those with as valid
sample weights in W2 (n = 14,190) were included. Due to
missing values on candidate predictors used for statistical
correction, final analytic samples were: W1 (n = 19,875)
and W2 (n = 13,650). Sample characteristics at W1 are
shown in Table 1. The use of secondary data was approved
and deemed exempt by the Institutional Review Board at
the authors' institution.

Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms, self-rated health, and self-esteem. Weight status at Wave 1 is based on body mass index calculated
from self-reported height and weight. Sample sizes do not always equal 100 % due to missing values. Sample sizes are shown in raw numbers; percentages are

because the variable was cleaned by Add Health staff
and is the most complete; all descriptive tables are strati-
fied by sex. Race/ethnicity at W1 was by self-report. Par-
ent highest education was drawn from the parent survey
at W1 and missing data were filled in with the adoles-
cent's report of parents' highest education at W1. All
other candidate predictors were measured at both time
points.
Height, weight, and body mass index
Self-reported height and weight were collected at both
waves. Measured height and weight were also collected
at W2. Height and weight were examined separately to
obtain predictive regression equations for each variable.
Body mass index was calculated by the standard formula
(kg/m2); for participants under age 20, SAS macros were
used to apply the US sex and age adjusted growth charts
[14, 15] to obtain age and sex specific BMI percentiles
and weight status classifications as follows: underweight
(UW < 5th percentile for age and sex); healthy weight
(HW = 5th to < 85th percentile); overweight (OW = 85th
to < 95th percentile); and obesity (OB > = 95th percentile).
For this study, calculations of BMI (or BMI percentile)
and weight status assignment were made based on mea-
sured height and weight at W2, self-reported height and
weight at W1 and W2, and corrected height and weight at
W1 and W2.
Puberty
Perceived physical maturity was measured with a self-
assessment item (range 1­5) of pubertal development
among males and females as follows: How advanced is
your physical development compared to other boys/girls
your age? Response set included: I look... younger than
most, younger than some, about average, older than
some, older than most. Although other indicators of
puberty were available (e.g., menarche for girls, voice
change for boys), subjective physical maturity taps into
self-image [16] in that could affect self-reported weight
or height, and it provides a common assessment for both
sexes.
Psychosocial factors
Body size estimation was assessed with the following
item: How do you think of yourself in terms of weight?
[very underweight (UW), slightly UW, about right,
slightly overweight (OW), very OW]. Very and slightly
UW were collapsed, and very and slightly OW were col-
lapsed to yield a three level class variable for body size
estimation (UW, About right, OW). Accuracy and in-
accuracy of body size estimation were tested for inclu-
sion in the prediction model but were dropped as non-
contributing factors. Depressive symptoms were assessed
at each wave with the Center for Epidemiological Studies
Depression Scale (CES-D) [17]. Self-esteem was mea-
sured with a 6-item adaptation of Rosenberg's 10-item
self-esteem scale scored on a 4-point scale [18]. The 6-
item adapted scale was developed by the Add Health re-
search team [19], and has been found to be unidimen-
sional and have good reliability [20]. Sample items were:
You have a lot of good qualities and You have a lot to be
proud of. Response categories ranged from 1 to 5
(Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree), and items were
recoded as needed so that higher scores reflected higher
self-esteem. Self-rated health was assessed with a single
item, developed by the original Add Health research
team and scored on a 5-point scale: In general, how is
your health? Would you say... Response categories
ranged from 1 to 5 (excellent, very good, good, fair,
poor) and were reverse coded so that higher scores re-
flect greater self-rated health. This item is nearly identi-
cal to that used in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item
Short Form (SF-36): "In general, would you say your
health is" with the same response categories [21]. Diet-
ing to lose weight was assessed with two items. First, all
participants were asked, "Are you trying to lose weight,
gain weight, or stay the same weight?" [Response cat-
egories: lose weight, gain weight, stay the same weight,
not trying to do anything about weight]. If participants
marked that they were trying to "lose weight" or "stay
the same weight" then they were asked a follow up ques-
tion: "During the past seven days, which of the following
things did you do in order to lose weight or to keep from
gaining weight?" Participants then marked yes/no to a
list of weight loss strategies, including dieted, exercised,
made yourself vomit, took diet pills, or took laxatives in
the past 7 days. If participants marked "dieted in the
past 7 days," they were coded as dieting to lose weight.
Statistical analysis plan
All final analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2.
Longitudinal population sample weights and survey pa-
rameters were applied to adjust for the complex survey
design of Add Health. We exploited the availability of
both measured and self-reported height and weight in
W2 to develop a statistical correction for the self-
reported weight and height in W1. First, we fit the W2
model and conducted model selection; we then applied
the W2 model to W1 data to obtain statistically cor-
rected values, as described in more detail below.
In the first stage, we fit two linear regression models
with response variables being W2 measured weight and
measured height and we used all candidate predictors.
Candidate predictors were characteristics known to
influence perceived body weight or height, including
self-reported height and weight, sex, age, puberty status,
race/ethnicity, parent education, depressive symptoms,
dieting, body size estimation, self-rated health, and

self-esteem at W2. We then used the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) to select the most efficient predictors of
measured height and weight values without overfitting the
data. We also tested two-way interactions between all
significant predictors for each regression model. Cat-
egorical predictors were treated as class variables in
order to generate a single regression equation. Final
models for weight (model 1) and for height (model 2)
are shown in Table 2.
In the second stage we applied the final two regression
models to W1 SR weight and height in separate analyses.
Then, we calculated a corrected BMI score from the cor-
rected height and weight values for each case. We then
used the corrected BMI scores to estimate corrected
weight status. For adolescents under age 20, we used
BMI percentiles derived from the CDC sex and age ad-
justed growth charts [14] and SAS macro program [15]
to calculate BMI percentile and assign weight status. For
those 20 years and older, we used the standard formula
to calculate BMI [kg/m2] and adult cutoffs for weight
status.
Finally, we calculated Pearson correlations, sensitivity/
specificity, and misclassification rates between measured
and corrected weight status among males and females.
Misclassification rates are presented in a contingency table
comparing weight status based on actual (measured) vs.
corrected BMI. In this context, the misclassification rate is
defined as the proportion of subjects whose self-reported

BMI or corrected BMI does not fall into the same category
as the measured BMI. Rates of weight status misclassifica-
tion after correction among males and among females can
be summed overall or across each type of misclassification
(over or under estimation) by summing values above or
below the diagonal that represents "true" classification
(see Table 4). For example, weight status underestimation
can be calculated by summing misclassification rates from
the upper diagonal of the contingency table (Table 4).
Results
Findings provided support or partial support for each
hypothesis. Our first hypothesis concerned the feasibility
of identifying an efficient model for predicting true
height and weight in W2. To adjust for bias in self-
reported (SR) weight and height, we used measured
weight and height at W2 as the response variables, and
regressed against candidate predictors (demographic,
biometric, and psychosocial) at W2 using linear regres-
sions (Table 2). A range of factors influenced measured
weight (Table 2, Model 1) and height (Model 2). After
AIC model selection, 9 contributing factors were
retained in Model 1 for weight: self-reported weight,
age, puberty, weight status, body size estimation, dieting,
depressive symptoms, self-rated health, and self-esteem
(R2 = 0.91). Race/ethnicity did not contribute to the effi-
ciency of the prediction of measured weight in Model 1
and so was removed. For predicting measured height at
W2 (see Table 2, Model 2), all candidate predictors
shown in Table 2 were contributing factors (R2 = 0.89).
In addition, we tested two-way interactions between all
significant predictors for each model, but none were
retained during the AIC selection process as contribut-
ing factors and so are not shown in Table 2.
Our second hypothesis was also supported. We hy-
pothesized that when the above correction procedures
were applied to SR data in W2 and used to compute
corrected BMI, the corrected BMI values would provide
a better estimate of measured BMI than SR data
alone at W2. Pairwise Pearson correlations between
BMI scores ­derived from measured, self-reported,
and adjusted height and weight in W2­ were calculated.
Before correction, the correlation between self-reported
BMI and measured BMI was 0.92 (P < 0.0001). After ap-
plying the correction procedure, the correlation between
measured BMI and corrected BMI increased slightly to
0.93, indicating the proposed correction yielded estimates
that were closer to the true values than SR alone.
We also calculated and compared sensitivity and speci-
ficity of self-report and corrected BMI in W2 using
measured BMI W2 as the reference. Table 3 shows the
sensitivity and specificity before and after applying
the correction. For males with overweight or obesity
(BMI  25), the sensitivity increased slightly from 87.7
to 88.0 % (<1 % increase); for males with obesity
(BMI  30), the sensitivity increased from 81.1 to 82.9 %
(1.8 % increase) with a small loss in specificity. Among fe-
males, after correction the sensitivity increased 3.4 % for
overweight or obesity, and increased 5.9 % for obesity. In
addition, the confidence intervals (SR and corrected) in
Table 3 show no overlap among females in the over-
weight/obesity group but a slight overlap among females
in the obesity group. However, non-overlap in confidence
intervals may not be a reliable method alone to assess stat-
istical significance [22] because they are heavily influenced
by standard deviations. Thus both percent change and
confidence intervals should be considered. With the in-
crease in sensitivity after correction, we found small de-
creases in specificity among females for overweight/
obesity group (1.8 %) and obesity group (0.6 %); and these
differences are smaller than the percent gains in sensitiv-
ity, suggesting an overall improvement of the proposed
correction. Since the general concern is that SR bias un-
derestimates incidence of overweight and obesity [1, 6],
and there are tradeoffs with sensitivity and specificity, im-
provement in sensitivity is the most desirable change we
would expect when attempting to correct for SR bias in
height and weight.
The third hypothesis was that using the proposed cor-
rected SR height and weight to calculate a corrected
BMI would result in a lower rate of misclassification of
weight status than would SR data alone in W2 among
those who underestimated their weight status, and this
was partly supported. As shown in Table 4, overall the
percentage of misclassification for each weight status
category was small after applying the correction. Using
measured BMI as the standard, the cumulative misclassi-
fication rate after the correction among underestimators
was reduced to 5.7 % for males and 5.6 % for females,
which was lower than the misclassification rate based on
SR alone (6.6 % and 8.0 %, respectively, not shown).
Finally, our fourth hypothesis was that the correction
procedure ­derived from empirical prediction models in
W2 using both measured and SR data ­ could be ap-
plied to the SR height and weight data in W1 to yield
corrected height, weight, BMI, and weight status vari-
ables that may reduce the SR bias documented in the lit-
erature among adolescents. The correction procedure
was applied to yield W1 corrected BMI values and W1
corrected weight status classifications. Since there is no
objective reference to W1 true height and weight, only
descriptive weight classifications based on W1 SR and
corrected BMI are shown in Table 5. As shown, 3 %
(n = 295) of females who self-reported as HW were
reclassified as OW and 1.3 % (n = 130) of females

were reclassified from OW to OB after the correction,
thus partially mitigating SR bias observed in W2.
Discussion
This study examined the feasibility and validity of
statistical adjustment methods to reduce bias of self-
reported height and weight in Wave 1 of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health
(Add Health). We described a rigorous statistical approach
to mitigate the bias introduced by self-reported height and
weight in Wave 1 of the Add Health data through statis-
tical adjustment. Because the Add Health longitudinal
study provides a sufficiently large sample size, many
candidate predictors, and both self-reported and mea-
sured weight and height in W2, we were able to for-
mulate a comprehensive model based on the most
salient predictors of discrepancy between self-reported
and measured values. We then tested the sensitivity
and specificity of the W2 corrected BMI, compared
to the W2 true (measured) BMI, and identified the
most efficient prediction model to apply to self-reported
values at W1.
Although numerous statistical corrections for self-
reported height, weight, or BMI have been developed
and published for other population data sets among ado-
lescents [11, 12, 23, 24] and adults [25, 26], to date we
found none that were recommended for Add Health. It
is critical that statistical adjustment models and predic-
tion equation coefficients be dataset specific, or at least
country and population specific [24], unless the samples
are truly comparable (e.g., nationally representative of
same population in the same year).
The statistical correction described here can be used
in two ways. First, if a study intends to draw from the
full W1 sample and overweight or obesity are the out-
comes of interest, the equations and coefficients (Table 2)
can be applied as described. Second, if an obesity ana-
lysis is planned that will draw upon a smaller, distinctive
analytic sample, such as foster youth or youth with
same-sex partners, then the procedures outlined here for
building, testing, and applying sex-specific prediction
models to obtain corrected BMI scores can be followed
but tailored to a particular subpopulation in Add Health.
Finally, studies based on other sources of data can use
these general principles and procedures to develop BMI
corrections for other datasets.
A limitation of the study is that there was a one year
difference between W1 and W2, so although the predic-
tion models were based on W2, it is possible that factors
influencing self-reported height and weight at W1 and
W2 were not the same. Another limitation was missing
data: the W2 correction equation could only be built
upon cases with complete data. Finally, these statistical
corrections are conservative and so have a relatively

small impact on correcting extreme discrepancies between
measured and SR values. Despite limitations, when obesity
is modeled as an outcome, applying this statistical correc-
tion does appear to reduce SR bias and improve sensitivity
for detecting obesity in W1 of the Add Health data, par-
ticularly among females. If the outcome of interest is de-
tecting underweight or normal weight only, the correction
would offer little advantage.
Conclusion
In summary, findings in this study address a growing
concern about bias in self-reported height and weight
among adolescents, specifically the underreporting of
obesity. Using unique features of a well-known and
widely used US national data set, we developed and
tested a formula to statistically adjust for observed self-
report bias in height and weight among adolescents,
using a wide variety of characteristics to account for
how each affects self-report bias on average among male
and female adolescents. The resulting corrections were
used to compute corrected BMI scores and weight status
classification. Corrected values improved sensitivity ­the
ability to detect a true positive--for obesity among
females, which addresses a major concern about self-
report bias in obesity research. Corrections did not im-
prove sensitivity to detect underweight or healthy weight
in adolescents of either sex, so the correction should be
applied selectively, depending on the research questions
and outcomes of interest.
