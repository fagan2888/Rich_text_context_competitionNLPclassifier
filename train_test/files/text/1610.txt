Socioeconomic status and injury mortality:
individual and neighbourhood determinants
Catherine Cubbin, Felicia B LeClere, Gordon S Smith
Abstract
Study objective--This study examined
both individual and neighbourhood corre-
lates of injury mortality to better under-
stand the contribution of socioeconomic
status to cause specific injury mortality.
Of particular interest was whether neigh-
bourhood eVects remained after adjusting
for individual demographic characteris-
tics and socioeconomic status.
Design--Census tract data (measuring
small area socioeconomic status, racial
concentration, residential stability, ur-
banisation, and family structure) was
merged with the National Health Inter-
view Survey (NHIS) and a file that links
the respondents to subsequent follow up of
vital status and cause of death data. Cox
proportional hazards models were speci-
fied to determine individual and neigh-
bourhood eVects on homicide, suicide,
motor vehicle deaths, and other external
causes. Variances are adjusted for the
clustered sample design of the NHIS.
Setting--United States, 1987­1994, with
follow up to the end of 1995.
Participants--From a sample of 472 364
persons ages 18­64, there were 1195 injury
related deaths over the follow up period.
Main results--Individual level eVects were
generally robust to the inclusion of neigh-
bourhood level variables in the models.
Neighbourhood characteristics had inde-
pendent eVects on the outcome even after
adjustment for individual variability. For
example, there was approximately a two-
fold increased risk of homicide associated
with living in a neighborhood character-
ised by low socioeconomic status, after
adjusting for individual demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics.
Conclusions--Social inequalities in injury
mortality exist for both persons and
places. Policies or interventions aimed at
preventing or controlling injuries should
take into account not only the socioeco-
nomic characteristics of people but also of
the places in which they live.

Recent research in the area of socioeconomic
disparities in health has focused on the role of
the residential environment in determining
health. A growing body of literature has
demonstrated that characteristics of communi-
ties where people live, such as family stability,
housing conditions, income and wealth, crime,
unemployment, segregation, and political em-
powerment, influence health outcomes and
behaviour.1­6 Social and economic characteris-
tics of a community determine, in part, local
access to goods and services, the built environ-
ment, the level of residential stability, crime,
social norms, and the ability to maintain social
control over individual behaviour. These analy-
ses take into account the social factors and
individual characteristics that contribute to
individual health outcomes. The basic goal of
most of this research is to diVerentiate between
individual risk and the broader societal sources
of risk.
A central hypothesis that drives much of the
contextual analysis of social inequalities and
health is that area characteristics represent
more than simply the sum of its parts (for
example, the aggregation of individual
characteristics).7 For instance, neighbourhood
level economic segregation is hypothesised to
aVect all members of a community, regardless
of their individual economic standing. Thus,
individual socioeconomic position may not
protect the health of people who are well oV
when they live in poor environments. A
number of recent studies have demonstrated
contextual eVects on the health of people using
the neighbourhood (that is, census tract, post-
code sector, ward) as the context. For example,
independent neighbourhood eVects have been
found for residential segregation on all cause
mortality,4 area socioeconomic status6 and
deprivation8 on several adult health measures;
area deprivation and cardiovascular disease risk
factors and mortality9; and female headship
rates and heart disease mortality in women.10
The consistent findings of these studies
strongly suggest that characteristics of places
are not simply proxies for individual character-
istics; indeed, we should be focusing on both
people and places.11
Death from external causes such as inten-
tional and unintentional injury has the most
plausible link to the residential environment as,
by definition, the source of injury is located
outside the person. External cause mortality,
however, is not well explored using techniques
of the type described above. A conceptual
model developed initially to understand motor
vehicle injuries, the Haddon matrix, describes
several factors related to the risk of injury:
human, agent, and the environment (physical
and socioeconomic).12 This descriptive frame-
work can also be extended to other causes of
injury death. We are particularly interested in
the impact of the residential socioeconomic
environment on the risk of dying from external
causes. To date, there has been no comprehen-
sive study that focuses on the joint contribution
of individual and community socioeconomic

characteristics to a person's risk of death from
injury. Several studies do, however, suggest that
aggregate measures are related to the overall
risk of an injury death.13­17 For example, Baker
et al found that low per capita income in the
county of residence is related to higher
homicide and unintentional fatal injury rates
for the US and that unintentional injury rates
are higher in rural compared with urban
areas.13 Other findings regarding injury mor-
tality have been based on specific geographical
areas.14­17
The ecological studies discussed above
suggest that geographical measures of socio-
economic conditions are related to aggregate
injury mortality outcomes. We do not know,
however, whether these measures have a direct
eVect on a person's mortality risk in the
presence of individual covariates. The purpose
of this paper is to bridge the gap in the
literature between the individual and ecological
levels regarding the relation between socioeco-
nomic status and death because of injury.
Firstly, we determine whether neighbourhood
or community characteristics make an inde-
pendent contribution to the risk of injury death
for people. Secondly, we determine whether
these eVects act as a proxy for a person's socio-
economic status or persist in model specifica-
tions that include both individual and neigh-
bourhood measures.
Methods
DATA
This analysis is based on three sources of data:
the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
1987­1994, the National Health Interview
Survey/Multiple Cause of Death Public Use
Data file (NHIS/NDI) 1987­1995, and the
1990 US Population Census. The NHIS is a
continuing annual household interview survey
representative of the civilian non-
institutionalised population of the United
States.18 Information is collected regarding
health status, health conditions, sociodemo-
graphics, and other characteristics of each
household member. For the purposes of this
study, we restrict the analysis to adult respond-
ents ages 18­64 (n=547 535), a population at
high risk of injury mortality.
The NHIS/NDI file was produced by
matching characteristics common to both the
NHIS and the National Death Index, which
contains the universe of death certificates and
is searched from the date of interview through
the end of 1995.19 The probability matching
methodology results in a score for each record
based on the number of characteristics
matched between the NHIS and the NDI and
has been shown to be highly accurate.20 Once
matches are identified, death certificates are
obtained from the states to ascertain cause of
death information. The matched NHIS/NDI
file contains person identification information,
vital status, matching class and score, date of
death, cause of death, and other information
from the NDI.
Using date of interview from the NHIS file
and date of death or censoring time from the
NHIS/NDI, number of months or duration
from time of interview until time of death or
censoring (31 December 1995) was calculated.
Injury deaths are defined as successful matches
in the NHIS/NDI file with an ICD-9 E-code
between 800 and 999. Deaths attributable to
adverse events and medical misadventures
(E930-E949, E870-E879) were subsequently
excluded (n=52). Four outcomes were investi-
gated: motor vehicle related deaths (E810-
E825), suicide (E950-E959), homicide (E960-
E978), and all other external causes (E800-
E807, E826-E929, E980-E999). The other
external cause category contains various causes
of injury death (poisonings, falls, drownings,
etc); however, the numbers were not suYcient
to investigate each cause separately.
Each annual file of the NHIS from 1987­
1994 also has the address of the respondents
geocoded to 1990 census geography, which are
used to link characteristics of the place of resi-
dence using census tract level data. About
13.7% (n=75 120) of the records were not
successfully geocoded and were dropped from
the analysis. The remaining NHIS respondents
with geographical identifiers reside in 6179
diVerent census tracts across the country. The
1990 Census data from Summary Tape Files
1A and 3A were used to construct the
neighbourhood level variables. Census tracts,
which are statistical rather than true geographi-
cal aggregates, were chosen to represent neigh-
bourhoods because previous research found
the tract to be a good approximation of the
neighbourhood environment with reliable so-
cial and economic data available from the US
Bureau of the Census. Census tracts include
approximately 4000 people and the boundaries
are delineated to encompass a relatively homo-
geneous population.21 22
The analysis includes only the sample of
records without missing neighbourhood infor-
mation reducing the sample size to 472 364
persons and 1195 injury deaths. The percent-
age distribution of total injury deaths by cause
is as follows: 17% homicide, 23% suicide, 33%
motor vehicle, 27% other external causes.
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL VARIABLES
Correlates at the individual level include age,
sex, self reported race/ethnicity, marital status,
income to needs ratio, educational attainment,
employment status and occupation. The in-
come to needs ratio is created by taking the
midpoint of the income categories in the
NHIS, and dividing by family size. All variables
are coded categorically except for age. These
variables have been shown to be reliable
individual level predictors of mortality risk due
to external causes.13 23 Correlations between
the measures of socioeconomic status (income
to needs, educational attainment, occupational
status) range between 0.16 and 0.59.
NEIGHBOURHOOD LEVEL VARIABLES
Census tract variables were selected to measure
the economic standing of the community (blue
collar, family income, poverty, education,
housing value, crowded housing); residential
and family stability (mobility, unemployment,
vacant housing, female headship, divorced);
518 Cubbin, LeClere, Smith
racial concentration (proportion black or
Hispanic); and urbanisation (multi-unit hous-
ing, urban residence) of the neighbourhood.
All variables are coded categorically using
empirical quartiles to identify appropriate cat-
egories. Table 1 lists the neighbourhood
variables and definitions.
ANALYTICAL METHOD
Continuous time event history methods are
used with person months calculated based on
month and year of survey and month and year
of death or censoring. Cause specific injuries
(motor vehicle, suicide, homicide, other exter-
nal causes) are analysed separately using Cox
proportional hazards models. Neighbourhood
level variables are first added to a baseline
model with individual demographic character-
istics. The purpose of this step is to determine
whether neighbourhood characteristics are
correlated with injury outcomes. Next, indi-
vidual socioeconomic status is introduced into
the models to determine if neighbourhood
conditions aVect the risk of a fatal injury net of

Neighbourhood determinants of injury 519
individual socioeconomic and demographic
risk factors. If significant neighbourhood ef-
fects remain after the reintroduction of indi-
vidual covariates, strong evidence exists that
those eVects are real and not attributable to
population composition. Each neighbourhood
characteristic is tested in a separate empirical
model because of extreme multicolinearity
between the neighbourhood variables.
The National Health Interview Survey is a
complex multistage probability sample that
yields clustered observations. Because the
sample is selected to be nationally representa-
tive, households are not chosen in a simple
random sample. The households are clustered
because at each stage of the sample selection
process, geographical areas are selected and
eventually targeted for interview. The survey
design eVects that result should be accounted
for when producing estimates or multivariate
models.24 For these analyses, the design eVects
are accounted for by using SUDAAN version
7.11 (Research Triangle Institute, 1997), a
software product, on the final models, which
accounts for the sampling design to produce
valid variance estimates. It is also true that
multilevel research designs such as this intro-
duce similar diYculties with statistical infer-
ence (related to clustering of people within
census tracts in this case) that the use of
specialised software also helps alleviate.25
Results
Table 2 contains the characteristics of the sam-
ple. Persons who died of injury tended to be
male, unmarried, and of lower income (except
for suicide), and educational attainment and
not in white collar occupations compared with
the total sample. Persons who died from homi-
cide were more likely to be black and of
younger age while those who died of suicide
were more likely to be white. The census tract
characteristics indicate that persons who died
of injury generally resided in neighbourhoods
with lower socioeconomic status, higher racial
concentration, and greater residential and fam-
ily instability compared with the total sample.
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL MODELS
Table 3 contains the adjusted risk ratios for the
four injury mortality outcomes resulting from
the Cox proportional hazards analyses in
SUDAAN for respondents of the NHIS linked
to the NDI and census data. From the models
for homicide, individual socioeconomic status
decreases the hazard ratios for black persons
from 5.14 in the models adjusted only for age,
gender, and race/ethnicity (not shown) to 3.62
in the models with additional adjustment for
marital and socioeconomic status. While there
is essentially no diVerence in homicide risk by
income, persons with low education and those
who are unemployed or out of the labour force
are at significantly increased risk of death from
homicide. In the individual level models for
suicide, there is a strong increased risk
associated with being male, white, previously
married, and out of the labour force. Men are
at twice the risk for motor vehicle mortality
compared with women. Unmarried, low in-
come, unemployed, blue collar, and persons
without a high school degree are all at
significantly increased risk of motor vehicle
fatalities. For other external causes of death,
which include unintentional poisoning, suVo-
cation, drowning, and falls, socioeconomic sta-
tus, marital status, and employment status are
each associated with the risk of death from
these causes. These results are consistent with
previous research on external causes of death.
NEIGHBOURHOOD LEVEL MODELS
Table 4 presents the neighbourhood level haz-
ard ratio estimates adjusted for individual
demographic and socioeconomic characteris-
tics and the NHIS sample design. One impor-
tant consideration in multilevel research is that
the neighbourhood eVects not be confounded
by a mis-specified individual level model.
Because of space considerations, we have not
included the individual level hazard estimates
in table 4 and the full tables are available from
the authors upon request. No model is
presented with more than one neighbourhood
variable because of extreme multicolinearity
between neighbourhood characteristics. Thus,
each neighbourhood variable is included in the

Neighbourhood determinants of injury 521
two models with the first risk ratio adjusted for
individual level demographic variables (age,
gender, and race/ethnicity) and the second for
all individual covariates (age, gender, race/
ethnicity, marital status, and socioeconomic
status). The hazard ratios are shown for both
models to demonstrate how the relations can
change after adjustment for individual socio-
economic status measures in addition to simply
age, gender, and race/ethnicity.
Homicide
The measures of neighbourhood socioeco-
nomic status operate in the expected direction
for homicide. Residence in neighbourhoods
with low family incomes, high poverty, high
proportions of poorly educated persons, low
housing values, and high proportions of
crowded housing, each significantly increase a
person's risk of death attributable to homicide,
after controlling for demographic and socio-
economic characteristics. Increased residential
concentration of blacks also leads to higher risk
of death from homicide regardless of a person's
race. Family structure, especially female head-
ship, is related to the risk of homicide in a
gradient fashion where the risk of death
increases as the proportion of female headed or
poor female headed households and divorced/
separated persons increases. All the relations
were attenuated when the models were ad-
justed for individual socioeconomic status.
This suggests that a proportion of the neigh-
bourhood eVect shown in the first column is
compositional but the remainder can be attrib-
uted to neighbourhood socioeconomic condi-
tions that are external to the individual. There
was no adjusted increased risk for persons liv-
ing in urban areas despite accepted wisdom of
the dangers of urban areas.
Suicide
Five neighbourhood characteristics had signifi-
cant eVects on the risk of suicide. The
individual level hazard ratios remain essentially
unchanged in the presence of neighbourhood
characteristics. For residential mobility, family
income, poverty, black racial concentration,
and poor female headed households, the
significantly increased risks of suicide are seen
at intermediate levels only. There is little or no
attenuation with the introduction of individual
socioeconomic status.
Motor vehicle
The results for motor vehicle fatalities show
that residents of neighbourhoods with lower
socioeconomic status and higher proportions
of poor households headed by women are at
higher risk. In contrast, persons living in urban
areas or highly racially segregated neighbour-
hoods are at lower risk. As in the models for
homicide, the hazard ratios for low socioeco-
nomic status and unemployed persons are
slightly attenuated (not shown).
Other external causes
The risk of death from other external causes is
increased for people living in poor and crowded
areas, while persons are at decreased risk in
urban areas and neighbourhoods with a high
percentage of Hispanic persons. Individual
socioeconomic status seems to account for
much of the observed neighbourhood eVects or
attenuates the eVects where they remain
important covariates. The individual hazard
ratios for socioeconomic status are attenuated
in the contextual models (not shown).
Discussion
In this research, we disentangle the eVects of
both socioeconomic status of people and that
of neighbourhoods on individual injury mor-
tality risk. The analysis is to our knowledge
unique in the field of injury mortality research
and represents an important step toward
understanding how disadvantages, measured
for both people and places, can operate to
increase mortality from external causes. The
findings presented here support the hypothesis
that both individual and neighbourhood char-
acteristics each contribute independently to
the risk of injury death. The contribution,
however, varies considerably by external cause.
For homicide, even after adjusting for
individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic
status, black adults are still at increased risk
compared with whites although the magnitude
is reduced considerably when neighbourhood
characteristics are introduced. The neighbour-
hood eVects suggest that social, economic, and
structural conditions in the community (for
example, availability or ownership of firearms)
are important determinants of homicide. Indi-
vidual racial and socioeconomic diVerences are
probably explained by mechanisms that work
through the residential environment. Indeed,
Centerwall15 found that when household
crowding is used as a measured of neighbour-
hood socioeconomic conditions, there were no
statistical diVerences in domestic homicide by
race.
The risk of suicide is statistically unrelated to
individual socioeconomic status. This is in
contrast with the findings of Kellermann et al
that demonstrate an increased risk of all
suicides for persons with limited education.27
Their findings, however, are based on a popu-
lation from a specific geographical area that
restricts their ability to generalise to the nation.
We find about a 50% increased risk for persons
living in neighbourhoods with the following
characteristics--low socioeconomic status,
high racial concentration, and high residential
and family instability. These places may
increase feelings of hopelessness or social isola-
tion for people who may be considering suicide
and, thus, contribute to the increased risk.
Blacks are at significantly lower risk of suicide
compared with whites even after controlling for
individual socioeconomic status, marital sta-
tus, and neighbourhood characteristics. This
remains relatively unexplored but may be
because of cultural diVerences to the resolution
of depressive episodes.
Neighbourhood socioeconomic status, racial
concentration, and family structure, net of
individual variability, are related to motor vehi-
cle mortality. Not surprisingly, persons living in
urban areas were found to be at decreased risk
522 Cubbin, LeClere, Smith
reflecting decreased exposure to traYc. This is
consistent with the results of a study that
examined geographical patterns of motor vehi-
cle mortality by county and found an inverse
relation with population density, most probably
related to the increased distances travelled in
rural areas28 and less access to nearby medical
care, especially trauma facilities. The neigh-
bourhood eVects suggest that persons in high
risk rural areas may have less access to newer,
more crashworthy cars and safer roads, have
greater distances to travel, and more exposure
to hazardous driving conditions and behaviour,
which could eVect all residents of a commu-
nity. The protective eVect of higher black racial
concentration may be attributable to its high
correlation with urbanisation.
One of the most obvious eVects of the exter-
nal environment is that experienced by those
living in rural (non-urban) settings. For other
external causes, those living in urban areas are
protected, probably in part because of the high
risk of fatalities in rural areas from farm equip-
ment, less access to medical care, and other
risks associated with working in the outdoors.
We speculate that the increased risk associated
with living in areas characterised by concen-
trated poverty and crowded housing is related
to the hazardous physical environment (for
example, deaths attributable to falls), poor fire
protection and use of equipment such as ovens
or space heaters for heating (for example,
deaths resulting from fire or suVocation),
hazardous work environments (for example,
occupational fatalities from various causes), or
limited access to safe recreational facilities (for
example, deaths caused by drowning).
Family structure and residential stability are
often used to measure social disorganisation or
a community's inability to maintain eVective
social controls.29 With higher levels of mobility
and single parent households, it may be more
diYcult for a community to collectively sustain
a sense of empowerment or control the appear-
ance of their neighbourhood or the behaviour
of its residents. Injury mortality is often viewed
as a consequence of the inability of people to
protect themselves from intentional or unin-
tentional harm. The deterioration of commu-
nity functions, both formal and informal, asso-
ciated with social disorganisation increases a
persons exposure to the risk of harm. Such fac-
tors are believed to be in part responsible for
the sudden increase in injury mortality in Rus-
sia over recent years.30 This research demon-
strates that similar people (based on demo-
graphic and socioeconomic characteristics),
suVer disproportionately in disorganised envi-
ronments such as those described here.
Favourable socioeconomic conditions reflect
an area's material resources and access to high
quality municipal services, such as fire and
police protection, safe roads, and recreational
facilities. For instance, regardless of a person's
socioeconomic status, this study shows that
that person is more likely to die of an injury
from any cause if they reside in an area with
high poverty levels. AZuent neighbourhoods
have lower crime rates, restrict access to cars
and "undesirable" neighbours, and their resi-
dents are less likely to tolerate deviant behav-
iour, each of which may be protective factors
against injury mortality.
Additional analyses were conducted to assess
the degree to which missing geocodes aVected
inferences (analyses not shown). Respondents
with missing geocodes were more likely to be
younger, white or Hispanic, married, and of
higher socioeconomic status when compared
with respondents whose records could be
geocoded in part because these reflect new
suburban developments not assigned geo-
codes. In addition, we ran the individual level
models with the full sample (including persons
with missing geocodes) to assess the degree to
which the individual level estimates were
aVected by the exclusions. Minor diVerences
were found.
There are several limitations in this study.
Neighbourhood characteristics are measured
in 1990 whereas the date of interview is from
1987 to 1994. This presents the possibility of
simultaneity bias as the neighbourhood charac-
teristics in some cases are measured after a
person has died. However, this is not expected
to be a major concern because neighbourhoods
generally do not change significantly over the
short time period involved.31 What is perhaps
more problematic conceptually is that neigh-
bourhood measures are static; that is, we have
no information regarding the historical context
of neighbourhoods, how they are changing, or
how long people have been exposed to their
neighbourhood environments.32 This analysis
essentially represents a snapshot of the eVects
of neighbourhood conditions on injury mor-
tality outcomes.
Thirdly, there was no way to distinguish
between occupational injuries. This is impor-
tant because people working in high risk occu-
pations and industries have diVerent risk
profiles than the rest of the population and may
be in part responsible for increased motor
vehicle rates in blue collar workers.33 The
analysis would be strengthened if it were possi-
ble to separate the work related cases from the
"other external cause" category. However,
using a method34 to identify causes likely to be
industrial, a small proportion of other external
causes were likely to be work related (14%) and
separate unpublished analyses have shown that
overall only 4.7% of all injury deaths in our age
group occurred "at work."
The main strength of the study is the ability
to estimate jointly the individual and neigh-
bourhood level determinants on an individual
level outcome. We used comprehensive meas-
ures of individual socioeconomic status to
minimise observing neighbourhood eVects
attributable to confounding.35 This research
links three national and reliable datasets in a
longitudinal design that strengthens our exter-
nal validity, and the ability to generalise to the
population as a whole.
Future research needs to analyse neighbour-
hood eVects for women and men separately.
Similarly, cross level interaction eVects ought
to be investigated to determine whether
neighbourhood eVects vary by individual
gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, and
Neighbourhood determinants of injury 523
socioeconomic status. For instance, given the
very diVerent neighbourhood environments of
blacks compared with whites, it is reasonable
to expect the neighbourhood eVects for homi-
cide to have diVerent magnitudes for the two
groups. Innovative and thoughtful approaches
to characterising neighbourhoods is sorely
needed to understand the most important
modifiable determinants of injury risk. Finally,
additional research is needed to identify the
intervening mechanisms between neighbour-
hood characteristics and injury. For example,
what social processes are involved in how
unfavourable socioeconomic neighbourhood
conditions result in increased injury risk to
people and how can they be modified?32
Identifying neighbourhood eVects has im-
portant policy implications as characteristics of
a peron's local social and economic environ-
ment can influence injury risk. Thus, social
policies, planning practices, and interventions
at the community level focusing both on places
and people are likely to be more eVective injury
control strategies than those focusing on
changing individual behaviour. Communities
ought to hold local government policymakers
and planners accountable to ensure that goods
and services are eYciently distributed accord-
ing to need. In addition, broader social and
economic policies related to taxation, the mini-
mum wage, labour markets, and social capital
are likely to have a positive impact on the health
and well being of residents of disadvantaged
communities and their injury risk. These
measures serve to promote a shift in focus from
people to intervening on places using the tools
of public health practice and advocacy.
