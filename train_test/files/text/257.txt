Background: Epidemiologic data suggest an associa-
tion between obesity and depression, but findings vary
across studies and suggest a stronger relationship in
women than men.
Objective: To evaluate the relationship between obe-
sity and a range of mood, anxiety, and substance use dis-
orders in the US general population.
Design: Cross-sectional epidemiologic survey.
Setting: Nationally representative sample of US adults.
Participants: A total of 9125 respondents who pro-
vided complete data on psychiatric disorder, height, and
weight. Response rate was 70.9%.
Main Outcome Measures: Participants completed
an in-person interview, including assessment of a
range of mental disorders (assessed using the World
Health Organization Composite International Diag-
nostic Interview) and height and weight (by self-
report).
Results: Obesity(definedasbodymassindex[calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in
meters]of30)wasassociatedwithsignificantincreases

order (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.12-1.93), and panic disorder
oragoraphobia(OR,1.27;95%CI,1.01-1.60).Obesitywas

95% CI, 1.20-1.59) and college graduates (OR,1.44; 95%
CI, 1.14-1.81).
Conclusions: Obesity is associated with an approxi-
mately 25% increase in odds of mood and anxiety disor-
ders and an approximately 25% decrease in odds of
substance use disorders. Variation across demographic
groups suggests that social or cultural factors may mod-
erate or mediate the association between obesity and
mood disorder.

THE INCREASING PREVALENCE
ofoverweightandobesityis
a major public health con-
cern. Among US adults,
prevalence of obesity (de-
finedasabodymassindex[BMI,calculated
asweightinkilogramsdividedbythesquare

approximately23%in1990to31%in2000.1
Similar increases were seen for men and
women, across all age groups, and across
allracial/ethnicgroups.1,2 Morerecentdata

creasesindiabetes,cardiovasculardisease,
andotheradverseconsequencesofobesity,

duce an unprecedented decline in life ex-
pectancy in the United States.3
Regulation of weight is a complex phe-
nomenon subject to a range of individual-
levelandcommunity-levelinfluences.Inthe
United States, obesity prevalence is higher
among middle-aged and older adults than
youngeradults.1,2 Obesityisalsomorecom-
mon among Hispanics and African Ameri-
cans than other racial/ethnic groups,1,2 with
racial/ethnic differences greater among
women than men.2 In developed econo-
mies,obesityisinverselyassociatedwithin-
come and other indicators of socioeco-
nomic status,4-6 but this relationship may
be weakening over time.5 At the commu-
nity level, obesity is associated with greater
access to inexpensive, calorie-dense
foods4,7,8 andwithreducedopportunitiesfor
physical activity.9,10
Previous research suggests that obesity
may be significantly associated with mood
disorders.11,12 Several community surveys

tress.16 Several US surveys have observed sex differences
inthisrelationship,withpositiveassociationsbetweenobe-
sity and depression among women and either negative or
no associations among men.17-20 One US survey14 sug-
gests a stronger association between obesity and depres-
sion among those younger than 65 years. Community sur-
vey data from the 1950s suggest a stronger association
between obesity and depression among those with higher
socioeconomic status.21 The associations between depres-
sion and obesity observed in largely white sample popu-
lations in the United States and Canada, however, may not
extend to other cultural or ethnic groups.22,23 Longitudi-
nal studies have found that depression predicts the sub-
sequent onset of obesity,24,25 that obesity predicts the sub-
sequent onset of depression,26 that successful weight loss
is associated with decreased depression,27 and that depres-
sion predicts poorer success in weight loss.28,29
Limited epidemiologic data address the relationship
between obesity and anxiety or substance use disorders.
Anxiety symptoms have shown moderate positive asso-
ciations with obesity in community30 and clinic31,32
samples. Alcohol abuse has been associated with a lower
risk of overweight and obesity.33
We used data from the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication (NCS-R) to examine whether associations be-
tween depression and obesity continue to appear in the
most recent survey of mental disorders in the United States
and whether those associations extend to other mental
disorders. We focus on the following questions: What are
the current associations between obesity and a range of
common mental disorders (mood, anxiety, and sub-
stance use disorders) in the US population? Do these as-
sociations vary according to sociodemographic charac-
teristics: sex, age, race/ethnicity, and educational
attainment (demographic characteristics consistently as-
sociated with obesity in the US population)?
METHODS
The NCS-R was an in-person survey of a nationally represen-
tative sample of US residents conducted between February 5,
2001, through February 12, 2003. Respondents were selected
from a multistage area probability sample of the noninstitu-
tionalized civilian population in the 48 contiguous states. The
response rate was 70.9%. More complete information on the
methods of the NCS-R is presented elsewhere.34,35
Potential participants were mailed a letter and a study fact
brochure. This was followed by an in-person interviewer visit.
Interviewers explained the study procedures and obtained ver-
bal informed consent before beginning the interview. Partici-
pants received $50 for participating. Recruitment and consent
procedures were approved by the human subjects committees
of Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass, and the University
of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
Professional nonclinician interviewers from the Institute for
Social Research at the University of Michigan conducted all as-
sessments. More than 300 interviewers participated in the study,
each receiving 7 days of study-specific training and success-
fully completing 2 practice interviews before beginning field
work. Interviews were administered using laptop computer-
assisted software that included built-in skip logic, timing flags,
and consistency checks. Regional supervisors recontacted a ran-
dom 10% of respondents for quality control.
Mental disorders were assessed using the World Mental
Health version of the World Health Organization Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).36 This fully struc-
tured diagnostic assessment was developed for use by trained
nonclinician interviewers in diverse community populations.
Mental disorder diagnoses are based on criteria of the DSM-IV.
Diagnoses considered in this article include mood disorders (ma-
jor depression, dysthymia, or bipolar disorder I or II), anxiety
disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia without panic, or gen-
eralized anxiety disorder), and substance use disorders (alco-
hol abuse and dependence or drug abuse and dependence). Pre-
vious research has documented good concordance between the
NCS-R CIDI diagnoses and blind clinical diagnoses, with the
CIDI generally having a higher diagnostic threshold in com-
parison with blind clinical diagnoses.36
Demographic characteristics (age, sex, and race/ethnicity),
height, and weight were assessed by participants' self-reports.
Previous methodological research suggests that self-reported
height and weight are highly correlated with direct physical mea-
surements,37-39 but self-report tends to consistently underesti-
mate weight and overestimate height,38-41 leading to low esti-
mates of overweight and obesity.
All analyses were based on weighted data and implemented
using SUDAAN statistical software (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC, 2002). The clustered sampling de-
sign of the NCS-R study could lead to overestimation of statisti-
calsignificance(ie,designeffect).Consequently,significancetests,
standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were esti-
mated using the Taylor Series method (delta method). All sig-
nificance tests were made using 2-sided tests evaluated at the .05
level of statistical significance.
RESULTS
This article includes 9125 NCS-R respondents (of 9282
possible) who provided data on height and weight.
Table 1 compares respondents with BMIs less than 30
with those with BMIs of 30 or more. As expected, those
with higher BMIs were more often African American or
Hispanic and were less likely to have completed more than
12 years of education.
As reported in Table 2, lifetime prevalence estimates
for mood and anxiety disorders are all higher among those
with BMIs of 30 or more than among those with BMIs less

than30.Oddsratios(ORs)comparingratesofspecificmood
and anxiety disorders in the obese and nonobese groups
range from approximately 1.2 to 1.5. A similar pattern was
seen for prevalence of mood or anxiety disorders in the last
12 months, with ORs in the range of 1.1 to 1.6. In con-
trast, lifetime and past-year prevalence estimates for sub-
stance use disorders are significantly lower in those with
BMIs of 30 or more. Some relationships (eg, major depres-
sion or any mood disorder) are statistically significant for
lifetime diagnosis and not so for past-year diagnosis. This
discrepancy, however, reflects wider CIs (due to lower
prevalence rate and fewer cases) rather than clinically or
statistically significant differences in ORs.
Subgroup analyses examined the relationship
between obesity and mood disorders across different
sociodemographic groups (Table 3). This association
did not vary significantly between men and women
(P=.65 for interaction). Although the association
between obesity and mood disorder appears stronger
among younger respondents, a formal test for interac-
tion finds no significant variation with age (P=.40 for
interaction with years of age as continuous measure).
The association between obesity and mood disorder is
only statistically significant among respondents with
more than 12 years of education, and a formal test for
interaction finds significant variation by years of edu-
cational attainment (P=.007 for interaction with years
of education as continuous measure). The association
between obesity and mood disorder is statistically sig-
nificant only among non-Hispanic whites. A formal
test for interaction finds a borderline significant differ-
ence in ORs between non-Hispanic whites and other
racial/ethnic groups (P = .06 for interaction with
non-Hispanic whites vs other racial/ethnic groups).
Columns 2 and 3 of Table 3 give the variation in mood
disorder prevalence and obesity prevalence by age,
educational attainment, and race/ethnicity. The socio-
demographic groups that showed the strongest asso-
ciation between obesity and depression (age 29
years, college education or higher, non-Hispanic
whites) are also among the groups with the lowest
prevalence of obesity.
Parallel subgroup analyses examined the association
between obesity and anxiety disorders across demo-
graphic groups (Table 4). This association does not vary
significantly according to sex (P=.52), age (P=.13), or
race/ethnicity (P=.21). The association is strongest in
those with the highest educational attainment, and a for-
mal test for interaction is marginally significant (P=.06
for interaction with years of education as a continuous
measure).

A third set of subgroup analyses examined variation
in the association between obesity and substance use dis-
orders (Table 5). This negative association does not vary
significantly by sex (P=.46), age (P=.22), race/ethnicity
(P=.43), or educational attainment (P=.36).
The final set of analyses considered potential con-
founders that might magnify or obscure associations be-
tween obesity and psychiatric disorders. Adjustment for
age and sex has no effect on the observed associations
(third column of Table 6). Although smoking is posi-
tively associated with psychiatric disorder and nega-
tively associated with obesity, adjustment for smoking
status has no meaningful effect on associations between
obesity and mood disorder, anxiety disorder, or sub-
stance use disorder (fourth column of Table 6). Finally,
adjustment for comorbid psychiatric disorder (eg, effect
of substance use disorder adjusted for mood and anxi-
ety disorders) also had no meaningful effect on ob-
served associations (fifth column of Table 6).
COMMENT
We observed significant positive associations between obe-
sity and a range of mood and anxiety disorders in a na-
tionally representative sample of the US household popu-
lation. In contrast, substance use disorders were associated
with significantly lower risk of obesity. These associa-
tions were not explained by confounding due to age, sex,
smoking, or comorbid psychiatric disorders. Mood and
anxiety disorders each made independent contributions
to obesity risk.
The positive associations between obesity and mood
or anxiety disorders were generally modest, with ORs in
the range of 1.2 to 1.5. Even these modest associations
carry public health significance, though, given the high
overall prevalence of obesity (approximately 25%) and
mood or anxiety disorders (approximately 25%). The es-
timated prevalence of lifetime mood disorder in those with
BMIs below 30 and in those with BMIs 30 or higher trans-
late to a population attributable risk of 24%, which in-
dicates that nearly one quarter of the cases of obesity in
the general population are attributable to the associa-
tion with mood disorder. This calculation illustrates the
public health importance of the association but does not
indicate a direction for the causal relationship. It is equally
correct to state that more than one fifth of cases of mood
disorder in the general population are attributable to the
association with obesity (population attributable risk of
21%). We have no way of distinguishing the direction
of the causal relationship between obesity and psychiat-
ric disorders or the possibility that unmeasured com-
mon causes induce an association between them.
The NCS-R offers several advantages over previous
community surveys used to examine associations be-
tween psychiatric disorders and obesity. First, the sample
was designed to be an accurate representation of the non-
institutionalized population of the 48 contiguous United
States. Results can be generalized to this population. Sec-
ond, the survey assessed a full range of psychiatric and
substance use disorders, allowing us to examine asso-
ciations with anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and sub-
stance use disorders. Third, mental disorders were as-
sessed using a well-validated structured diagnostic
interview, which allowed the association of obesity with
these disorders to be assessed with accuracy. Fourth, the
assessment considered lifetime diagnoses and current
state. Assessment of lifetime diagnosis is preferable be-
cause an association between weight and psychiatric dis-
order would be expected to reflect long-term behavioral
and/or biological mechanisms.
The associations between obesity and psychiatric dis-
orders in this sample did not vary between men and

women. This contrasts with findings in other US na-
tional surveys17-20 that indicate that positive associa-
tions between obesity and depression exist among women,
whereas negative or absent associations exist among men.
We are unable to identify any consistent differences in
methods between our study and previous studies that
would explain why earlier studies found no association
between obesity and depression in men, whereas such
an association was observed in the NCS-R sample. In one
earlier study,20 the magnitude of the OR between obe-
sity and depression in men was similar to that in women,
but the lower prevalence of depression in men led to a
wider CI and a statistically insignificant result. A simi-
lar phenomenon is seen in this sample for both mood and
anxiety disorders. Because we observe no statistically sig-
nificant interaction with sex, we conclude that this dis-
crepancy (significant association in women but not in
men) probably reflects differences in statistical power
rather than differences in magnitude of the association.
Most previous research has focused on the association
between obesity and depression, and various mechanisms
havebeenproposedtoexplainthisrelationship.11,12,42 Some
of those mechanisms propose a causal pathway that leads
from depression to obesity. Increased appetite and weight
gain are common symptoms of depression,43,44 and ten-
dency to gain weight remains stable across depressive epi-
sodes.43 Depression may lead to reduced physical activ-
ity,45 increasingtheriskofobesity.Depressionmayincrease
risk of weight gain through its effect on binge eating,46,47
especially among women.28,48 Medications used to man-
agemoodoranxietydisordersmayalsoleadtoweightgain.49
Alternatively, some proposed mechanisms suggest a causal
relationship that leads from obesity to depression. The
stigmaattachedtoobesity(especiallyforwomen)maycon-
tribute to depression.50,51 Activity limitations due to obe-
sity or obesity-related chronic illnesses may increase risk
ofdepressionbyreducinginvolvementinrewardingorplea-
surable activities.30 Finally, depression and obesity may be
linked through some common cause or third factor, either
environmental (eg, childhood abuse52) or biological.
We observed an interesting variation in the relation-
ship between obesity and mood disorder across socio-

demographic groups. The association appeared stron-
ger in younger than older respondents, in non-Hispanic
whites than other racial/ethnic groups, and in respon-
dents with higher educational attainment. Only the in-
teraction with educational attainment, however, was sig-
nificant at the .05 level. Approximately 40 years ago, The
Midtown Manhattan Study21 also observed that, among
women, the association between obesity and depression
was confined to those with higher socioeconomic sta-
tus. In the NCS-R sample, the groups that showed the
strongest association between obesity and mood disor-
der were also the groups with the lowest overall rates of
obesity. A similar phenomenon has been observed re-
garding the association between depression and to-
bacco use; as rates of tobacco use decline, the associa-
tion between tobacco use and depression grows stronger.53

relationship between obesity and mood or anxiety disor-
ders. If stigmatization of overweight and obesity causes or
contributes to mood and anxiety disorders, the effects of
stigmamightbemorepowerfulinsociodemographicgroups
with lower obesity rates. Some previous research suggests
that self-perception of overweight54,55 and the perceived
stigma associated with obesity56-59 may both be greater in
white populations and those with higher income or edu-
cational attainment. Alternatively, if mood or anxiety dis-
orders contribute to obesity through an effect on health be-
haviors(reducedphysicalactivity,increasedcaloricintake),
then this effect could be more easily expressed in sociode-
mographic groups with lower obesity rates. This cross-
sectional study does not allow us to distinguish between
causalmechanismsorexaminehowtheymightdifferacross
sociodemographic groups.
Our findings also do not indicate a specific mechanism
or causal direction for the observed negative association
between obesity and substance use disorders. Although al-
cohol or other substances may have a direct effect on ap-
petite or caloric intake, a negative association was also ob-
servedinthosewithhistoriesofsubstanceabuse(ie,lifetime
substance use disorder not active in the last 12 months).
We conclude that obesity is meaningfully associated
with a range of common mood and anxiety disorders in
the general US population. Obesity is associated with a
moderately lower risk of substance use disorder. Varia-
tion in the obesity-depression relationship by educa-
tional level and race/ethnicity suggests an important role
of social or cultural factors in mediating or moderating
the relationship between obesity and mood disorders.
Clarifying the social and cultural influences on the rela-
tionship between obesity and mood or anxiety disor-
ders will require additional research in populations with
a broader range of race/ethnicity, educational attain-
ment, and income. Clarifying the direction of causal re-
lationships will require alternative research designs, in-
cluding longitudinal and experimental studies.
