RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS
(RSV) is the most important
cause of lower respiratory tract
diseaseamonginfantsandchil-
dren worldwide.1,2 Almost all children
have been infected with RSV by age 2
years.3 Although reinfection through-
out life is common, a child's initial RSV
infection typically is the most severe and
the most likely to involve the lower res-
piratory tract.3,4 Severe RSV disease, as
gauged by the requirement for hospital
admission, is most common among in-
fants aged 1 to 3 months.3,5
The hallmark of RSV infection is
bronchiolitis, a disease of infancy char-
acterized by wheezing, lung hyper-
expansion, and hypoxia. Other lower
respiratory tract illnesses, especially
pneumonia, are also common manifes-
tations of RSV infection. In studies of
hospitalized children in temperate
countries, RSV infection has been as-
sociated with 43% to 74% of bronchi-
olitis cases6-12 and with 19% to 54% of
pneumonia cases.6-10 During the 1985-
1994 winter seasons in Rochester, NY,
RSV was associated with 50% to 80%
of bronchiolitis hospitalizations and
with 30% to 60% of pneumonia hospi-
talizations.13
The only national estimates of hos-
pitalizations attributable to RSV infec-
tion were made by the Institute of Medi-
cine in 1985.14 By estimating that 0.5%
of children younger than 5 years in-
fected with RSV would require hospi-
talization, and assuming that 60% of
RSV-associated hospitalizations would
occur among infants younger than 1
year, the Institute of Medicine pro-
jected that 54 697 infants younger than
1 year and 36 465 children aged 1

Context Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes more lower respiratory tract infec-
tions, often manifested as bronchiolitis, among young children than any other patho-
gen. Few national estimates exist of the hospitalizations attributable to RSV, and re-
cent advances in prophylaxis warrant an update of these estimates.
Objectives To describe rates of bronchiolitis-associated hospitalizations and to es-
timate current hospitalizations associated with RSV infection.
Design and Setting Descriptive analysis of US National Hospital Discharge Survey
data from 1980 through 1996.
Participants Children younger than 5 years who were hospitalized in short-stay, non-
federal hospitals for bronchiolitis.
Main Outcome Measure Bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization rates by age and
year.
Results During the 17-year study period, an estimated 1.65 million hospitalizations
for bronchiolitis occurred among children younger than 5 years, accounting for 7.0
million inpatient days. Fifty-seven percent of these hospitalizations occurred among
children younger than 6 months and 81% among those younger than 1 year. Among
children younger than 1 year, annual bronchiolitis hospitalization rates increased 2.4-
fold, from 12.9 per 1000 in 1980 to 31.2 per 1000 in 1996. During 1988-1996, infant
hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis increased significantly (P for trend .001), while
hospitalization rates for lower respiratory tract diseases excluding bronchiolitis did not
vary significantly (P for trend = .20). The proportion of hospitalizations for lower res-
piratory tract illnesses among children younger than 1 year associated with bronchi-
olitis increased from 22.2% in 1980 to 47.4% in 1996; among total hospitalizations,
this proportion increased from 5.4% to 16.4%. Averaging bronchiolitis hospitaliza-
tions during 1994-1996 and assuming that RSV was the etiologic agent in 50% to
80% of November through April hospitalizations, an estimated 51 240 to 81 985 an-
nual bronchiolitis hospitalizations among children younger than 1 year were related
to RSV infection.
Conclusions During 1980-1996, rates of hospitalization of infants with bronchiol-
itis increased substantially, as did the proportion of total and lower respiratory tract
hospitalizations associated with bronchiolitis. Annual bronchiolitis hospitalizations as-
sociated with RSV infection among infants may be greater than previous estimates for
RSV bronchiolitis and pneumonia hospitalizations combined.

through 4 years were hospitalized an-
nually for bronchiolitis or pneumonia
associated with RSV.
Recent progress in 2 areas warrants
updating national RSV-associated hos-
pitalization estimates. First, the Food
and Drug Administration recently li-
censed palivizumab, a humanized mu-
rine RSV monoclonal antibody for
monthly intramuscular administra-
tion among high-risk children during
RSV seasons to prevent lower respira-
tory tract disease hospitalizations.15
Palivizumab is easier to deliver and less
expensive than the previously avail-
able prophylactic antibody prepara-
tion, RSV-enriched human immuno-
globulin, which must be intravenously
administered. Recommendations from
the American Academy of Pediatrics re-
garding use of both products among
high-risk infants are available.16 Sec-
ond, advances in the development of
safe subunit and live attenuated RSV
vaccine candidates have been re-
ported recently.17-19 To update hospi-
talization estimates, we examined tem-
poral trends in hospitalizations among
US children associated with bronchi-
olitis, the most specific RSV-associ-
ated illness. We estimated recent RSV-
associated hospitalizations by using
discharge data for bronchiolitis and
used bronchiolitis and pneumonia
hospitalizations to estimate RSV-
associated morbidity among infants.
METHODS
Hospital discharge data from 1980
through 1996 were obtained from the
National Hospital Discharge Survey
(NHDS) through the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC).20 The NHDS is a representative
sampleofpatientdischargerecordsfrom
short-stay,nonfederal,generalandchil-
dren's hospitals in the United States.21
Hospitalizations were weighted using
NCHSprocedurestoobtainnationales-
timates.22 NHDSrecordsdonotcontain
individualidentifiers;therefore,theunit
of analysis was a hospitalization.
All discharge records from children
younger than 5 years with an Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-
CM) code for any respiratory illness
(codes 460-519)23 among the as many
as 7 discharge diagnoses listed were
selected for study. A bronchiolitis-
associated hospitalization was defined
as a discharge with acute bronchiolitis
(code 466.1)listedanywhereontherec-
ord. Use of this strategy detected hos-
pitalizations for which a bronchiolitis-
associated complication (eg, respiratory
failure) might be coded first and those
associated with nosocomially ac-
quired bronchiolitis, which may rep-
resent a substantial proportion of
RSV-associated bronchiolitis among
hospitalized infants.24,25 Severe bron-
chiolitis was defined as a discharge list-
ing an ICD-9-CM procedure code for
endotracheal intubation (code 96.04)
or for receipt of continuous mechani-
cal ventilation (codes 96.72 or 96.71
[1992-1996]; 93.92 [1988-1991]; or
93.90 [1980-1987]).23
Hospitalizationswerestratifiedbypa-
tient age: younger than 6 months, 6
through 11 months, 12 through 23
months, or 24 through 59 months. For
approximately 1.0% of bronchiolitis
hospitalizations, age data were miss-
ing; these records were not included in
analyses. Hospitalizations were also
stratified by sex, length of stay, and cen-
sus geographic region (Northeast, Mid-
west, South, and West).26 Because data
on race/ethnicity were missing from
23% of discharge records examined, we
made no comparisons by ethnici-
ty.21,27 Temporal trends in hospitaliza-
tions were examined by discharge
month and year. From 1988 through
1996, aggregate estimates of dis-
charges by month were made using only
records sampled from hospitals fully re-
sponding for that year (I. M. Shimizu,
PhD, NCHS, written communication,
November 16, 1998).20 Bronchiolitis
and pneumonia hospitalizations attrib-
utable to RSV were estimated using win-
ter RSV recovery rates among chil-
dren hospitalized with bronchiolitis
(50% to 80%) or pneumonia (30% to
60%).6-13 Only hospitalizations occur-
ring from November through April
were used in estimating disease likely
attributable to RSV infection.
To determine whether changes in di-
agnostic coding practices during the
study period influenced the number of
bronchiolitis-associated hospitaliza-
tions, other lower respiratory tract dis-
ease hospitalizations were also exam-
ined. Discharges associated with lower
respiratory tract diseases other than
bronchiolitis were defined by the fol-
lowing ICD-9-CM codes: acute and
chronic/unspecified bronchitis (466.0,
490-491); pneumonia (480-486); in-
fluenza (487); asthma (493); bronchi-
ectasis (494); pneumonitis (507); res-
piratory conditions due to unspecified
external agents (508); emphysema
(492); empyema (510); pleurisy (511);
and other diseases of the lower respi-
ratory system (512-519).23 Condi-
tionsspecificallynotedondischargerec-
ords included pneumonia, organism
unspecified (486), bronchopneumo-
nia (485), RSV pneumonia (480.1),
other specified viral infection (078.9),
otitis media (382.9), congenital heart
disease (745-747), chronic respira-
tory distress arising in the perinatal
period (770.7), and a history of peri-
natal problems (V13.7).
Hospitalization rates were calcu-
lated using denominators derived from
US census data for children younger
than 5 years23 or from US natality data
for children younger than 1 year.28
Population estimates of children age 1
through 4 years for each calendar year
were made by subtracting natality fig-
ures from census figures. Rates were ex-
pressed as the number of estimated hos-
pitalizations per 1000 children of the
corresponding age group.
The NHDS was redesigned in 1988,
when new methods of sampling hos-
pitals and collecting data were intro-
duced; however, most estimates
obtained using the old and the new
methodshavenotbeensubstantiallydif-
ferent.29 SUDAAN software30 was used
to calculate annual SEs during 1988-

pling techniques used during this

tistical tests for rate comparisons were

RESULTS
Bronchiolitis Hospitalizations
From 1980 through 1996, an esti-
mated 1 648 281 (SE, 121 129) hospi-
talizations associated with bronchiol-
itis occurred among US children
younger than 5 years. Eighty-one per-
cent (1 334 566; SE, 105 396) of these
hospitalizations occurred among chil-
dren younger than 1 year and 57%
(946 358; SE, 83 309) among children
younger than 6 months. As expected for
an illness frequently associated with
RSV infection, bronchiolitis hospital-
izations peaked annually during the
winter months, usually in January or
February (FIGURE 1). Among children
younger than 5 years, 81% of bronchi-
olitis hospitalizations occurred from
November through April, and among
children younger than 1 year, 83% oc-
curred during these months.
Duringthestudyperiod,weestimated
that bronchiolitis hospitalizations ac-
counted for 7.0 million inpatient days
(SE,575 554).Themedianlengthofstay
was3daysperhospitalization(interquar-
tile range, 2-5 days). Length of stay did
notvarysubstantiallybyageinmonths,
by sex, or by calendar year (data not
shown).
Although the annual number of
bronchiolitis hospitalizations fluctu-
ated, they increased among children in
each age group during the study pe-
riod (FIGURE 2). The most dramatic rise
in hospitalizations occurred among
children younger than 6 months, for
whom bronchiolitis hospitalizations in-
creased by 239% from 1980 to 1996.
Among children aged 1 through 4
years, the bronchiolitis hospitaliza-
tion rate increased gradually, from 1.3
per 1000 in 1980 to 2.3 per 1000 in
1996 (+77%). Among children younger
than 1 year, rates increased more rap-
idly during this period, from 12.9 per
1000 to 31.2 per 1000 (+152%).
Bronchiolitis hospitalization rates in-
creased proportionately among males
and females. Among infant males, the
rate increased from 24.9 per 1000 dur-
ing 1988-1990 to 38.4 per 1000 dur-
ing 1994-1996 (+54%; P = .01); among
infant females the rate increased from
15.1 to 24.4 per 1000 (+62%; P = .02)
during these periods. Males were 1.6
times more likely to be hospitalized
with bronchiolitis than females, irre-
spective of age group or calendar year.
Bronchiolitis hospitalization rates
among infants increased in each of the

4 regions of the United States. How-
ever, the only statistically significant in-
crease took place in the South, where
the annual average hospitalization rate
increased from 19.0 per 1000 in 1988-
1990 to 33.4 per 1000 in 1993-1995
(+75.8%; P = .03).
Hospitalization Rates for Lower
Respiratory Tract Diseases
From 1980 through 1996, bronchiol-
itis was responsible for increasing pro-
portions of lower respiratory tract dis-
ease and total hospitalizations among
children younger than 1 year. The pro-
portion of total hospitalizations among
children younger than 1 year associ-
ated with bronchiolitis increased from
5.4% to 16.4%; for lower respiratory
tract diseases, the proportion diag-
nosed with bronchiolitis increased from
22.2% to 47.4% (TABLE).
To determine whether bronchiolitis
hospitalization rates were influenced by
temporal trends in diagnostic coding
practices, we examined hospitaliza-
tion rates for other lower respiratory
tract diseases. Hospitalization rates
among children younger than 1 year for
all lower respiratory diseases in-
creased by 13% during the study pe-
riod, from 58.1 per 1000 in 1980 to 65.8
per 1000 in 1996 (FIGURE 3). Pneumo-
nia hospitalization rates declined from
28.5 per 1000 in 1980 to 23.9 per 1000
in 1988, while bronchiolitis hospital-
ization rates increased from 12.9 to 17.3
per 1000. The increase in bronchiol-
itis rates during 1980-1988 may have
resulted, in part, from a trend to diag-
nose bronchiolitis instead of pneumo-
nia among children younger than 1
year. However, bronchiolitis hospital-
ization rate increases after 1989 among
children younger than 1 year were not
accompanied by concomitant rate de-
creases for either pneumonia or asthma
(Figure 3). Finally, hospitalization rates
for bronchiolitis and all lower respira-
tory tract diseases increased signifi-
cantly during 1988-1996 (P for trend
.001 for each comparison), while
hospitalization rates for all lower res-
piratory tract diseases except for bron-
chiolitis did not vary significantly (P for
trend = .20).
Recent Patterns in Bronchiolitis
Hospitalizations
Specific diagnoses and procedures as-
sociated with bronchiolitis discharges
were examined in detail during 1994-
1996 to determine the most recent hos-
pitalization patterns. Bronchiolitis was
the first-listed diagnosis in 83% of rec-
ords. Pneumonia, organism unspeci-
fied (4.5%), RSV pneumonia (2.9%),
asthma(1.9%),andbronchopneumonia
(1.1%) were other common first-
listed diagnoses. The most frequent un-
derlying conditions recorded for bron-
chiolitis-associated discharges were
congenital heart disease (2.4%), chronic
respiratory distress arising in the peri-
natal period (2.0%), and a history of
perinatal problems (1.4%).
Severe bronchiolitis was uncom-
mon during the entire study period, but
it may have become more prevalent in
recent years. Among children younger
than 1 year during the entire study,

1.0% of bronchiolitis hospitalizations
were coded for endotracheal intuba-
tion or receipt of continuous mechani-
cal ventilation. However, during 1994-
1996, the discharges of 1.7% of children
younger than 1 year hospitalized with
bronchiolitis were coded for endotra-
cheal intubation or for receipt of con-
tinuous mechanical ventilation.
Procedures frequently coded for the
discharges of children younger than 1
year with a 1994-1996 bronchiolitis-
associated hospitalization included
nebulization therapy (17.2%), receipt
of supplemental oxygen (8.6%), lum-
bar puncture (4.8%), and antibiotic in-
jection (1.3%).
Estimates of RSV-Associated
Hospitalizations
To provide current estimates of RSV-
associated morbidity, we averaged bron-
chiolitis hospitalizations among chil-
dren younger than 1 year and 5 years
during1994-1996.Anaverageof123471
bronchiolitis hospitalizations occurred
annually among children younger than
1 year and 154 365 among children
younger than 5 years during this 3-year
period. Assuming that 50% to 80% of
bronchiolitis hospitalizations occur-
ring during November through April
were attributable to RSV, we estimated
that 51 240 to 81 985 children younger
than 1 year and 62 518 to 100 029 chil-
dren younger than 5 years were hospi-
talized during each of these years for
RSV-associated bronchiolitis.
We also estimated the contribution
of RSV to pneumonia hospitaliza-
tions among children younger than 1
year. Assuming that 30% to 60% of
November through April pneumonia
hospitalizations in 1994-1996 were
RSV-related, 22 160 to 44 321 infant
pneumonia hospitalizations annually
were attributable to RSV infection.
COMMENT
Ourstudyisthefirsttoexaminetempo-
ral trends in bronchiolitis hospital-
izations and estimate RSV-associated
hospitalizationsbyusingnationallyrep-
resentative data. Our finding that bron-
chiolitishospitalizationshaveincreased
substantiallyduringthe17yearsstudied
was not expected. We found that infant
bronchiolitis hospitalization rates in-
creasedsignificantlyfrom1988through
1996,whilehospitalizationratesforother
lower respiratory tract diseases did not
varysignificantly.Amonginfants,bron-
chiolitiscurrentlyisassociatedwithap-
proximately47%oflowerrespiratorytract

tal discharges.
In1985,theInstituteofMedicinees-
timatedthat91 162hospitalizationsfor
bronchiolitisandpneumoniaassociated
with RSV occurred annually among
US children younger than 5 years.14
For bronchiolitis alone, we estimate
that 62 500 to 100 000 RSV-associated
hospitalizationsoccurannuallyamong
children younger than 5 years. The In-
stitute of Medicine appeared to under-
estimatetheRSV-associateddiseasebur-
den among infants younger than 1 year
because they assumed that 60% of RSV
hospitalizationsamongchildrenyounger
than5yearswouldoccuramonginfants.
Wefoundthat81%ofbronchiolitishos-
pitalizations occurred among infants.
Ourestimateof51 200to82 000annual
infanthospitalizationsforRSV-associated
bronchiolitis is similar in magnitude to
the 1985 Institute of Medicine projec-
tion of 54 700 RSV-associated infant
hospitalizations for bronchiolitis and
pneumonia combined.14 Currently, we
estimate that 73 400 to 126 300 annual
hospitalizations among US infants for
bronchiolitis or pneumonia may be at-
tributabletoRSVinfection,considerably
more than the 1985 projection.
The etiology of the increase in bron-
chiolitis hospitalization rates is prob-

although modification of NHDS proce-
duresin1988couldaffectthecompara-
bility of discharge data collected before
andafterthatyear,muchoftheincrease
inbronchiolitishospitalizationrateshas
takenplacesince1989andcannotbeex-
plained by design changes. Finally, if
diagnostic-codingvariationsduringthe
studyperiodsubstantiallyinfluencedthe
increaseinbronchiolitishospitalization
rates, we would expect a compensatory
decreaseinhospitalizationratesforother
lowerrespiratorytractdiseaseswithclini-
calpresentationssimilartobronchiolitis.
From 1988 through 1996, when infant
bronchiolitishospitalizationratesalmost
doubled,hospitalizationratesforunspeci-
fied pneumonia and asthma also in-
creased. Therefore, it is difficult to pos-
tulate that diagnostic substitution fully
explainstheincreaseinbronchiolitishos-
pitalization rates.
Otherfactorsmayhavecontributedto
increasesinbronchiolitishospitalization
rates. Attendance at a child-care center
with 6 or more other children is an in-
dependent risk factor for a lower respi-
ratorytractdiseasehospitalizationinthe
first 2 years of life.38 Enrollment of chil-
drenyoungerthan3yearsincenter-based
child care increased during the study.
Among children aged 1 through 2 years
withemployedmothers,theproportion
enrolled in child-care centers increased
from12%in1982to25%in1993.Among
childrenyoungerthan1year,enrollment
increased from 5% to 20%.39 A trend to-
wardearlierenrollmentinlargechild-care

mustbeexaminedinrelationtobronchi-
olitis hospitalization trends.
Criteria for hospital admission
among children with bronchiolitis may
have changed during the study period
and influenced hospitalization rates.
Specifically, pulse oximetry measure-
ments during the evaluation of wheez-
ing children became more common and
may have led to new criteria for hos-
pital admission. In a prospective study
of wheezing children presenting to a pe-
diatric emergency department, the pro-
portion receiving pulse oximetry in-
creased from 87% during December
1987 through May 1988 to 96% during
June through September 1991. The cor-
responding hospitalization rate among
wheezing children increased from
10.4% to 15.6%.40 A study examining
routine pulse oximetry use during
emergency department evaluation of
children with respiratory symptoms
found that oximetry detected an oxy-
gen saturation of less than 92% more
effectively than physical examination
alone.41 Ifmild-to-moderatehypoxiade-
tected by pulse oximetry has been
added to traditional criteria for hospi-
talizing young children with bronchi-
olitis (eg, respiratory distress or diffi-
culty feeding), then increasing use of
pulse oximetry may explain the in-
crease in hospitalization rates. Al-
though we are unaware of any data spe-
cifically examining oximetry use trends
in children with bronchiolitis, a na-
tional survey of 376 emergency depart-
ments in 1992 found that 67% rou-
tinely used pulse oximetry in the
assessment of pediatric asthma.42
Improved survival of prematurely
born infants at greater risk for serious
RSV-associated disease may have influ-
encedbronchiolitishospitalizationrates.
Nevertheless, our data suggest that such
high-risk infants represent a small pro-
portion of children hospitalized with
bronchiolitis: only 2% of 1994-1996
bronchiolitis discharges were concur-
rently coded for chronic lung disease. It
is possible that underlying medical con-
ditions were underreported in NHDS
data. Procedures were underreported in
these data. While approximately 9% of
bronchiolitis discharge records during
1994-1996 were coded for receipt of
supplemental oxygen, hospital-based
studies have reported that 34% to 75%
of RSV-infected children received
supplemental oxygen.43-45 Underreport-
ing of procedures may reflect a lack of
reimbursement for routine hospital care
suchasoxygenadministration.Thepos-
sible contribution of underlying condi-
tions, including premature birth and
congenital heart disease, to bronchiol-
itis hospitalization trends needs to be
morefullyascertained.However,itisun-
likely the survival of more premature
infants could account for a substantial
proportionoftheincreaseininfantbron-
chiolitis hospitalization rates.
Thisstudyhasseverallimitations.First,
NHDS-basedhospitalizationestimatesare
generatedbyusingacomplex,nationally
representativesampleofdischarges,which
in1996wereamassedfrom480respond-
ing hospitals.21 Thus, the weighted esti-
mates have more variability than might
be expected from the magnitude of the
numbers presented. We have presented
SEs where appropriate so that this vari-
abilitycanbeassessed.Second,theNHDS

ring in federal facilities providing pedi-
atric care, particularly Indian Health
Service hospitals--and the highest US

cioeconomicstatus,suchasrace/ethnicity

amination of these factors. Infants born
to low-income urban families have in-
creased admission rates for acute lower
respiratory tract disease compared with
thoseborntomiddle-incomefamilies.3,47-51
