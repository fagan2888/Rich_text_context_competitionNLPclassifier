Background: Optimal timing of cMRI after therapeutic hypothermia is controversial.
Aim: To compare cMRI postnatal d4 with d10.
Methods: Sagittal/axial T1 IR-weighted and axial T2-weighted images were visual scored: Basal ganglia
and thalami (DNGM), white (WM), cortical gray matter (CGM) 0-3 (0=normal, 1=mild, 2=moderate,
3=severe), posterior limb of capsula interna (PLIC) 0-2 (0=normal, 1=equivocal, 2=loss), haemorrhages 0-2
(0=none, 1=extra-axial, 2=intracerebral).
Results: Twenty-five infants (GA 36-41) were examined.

No4 1 1 2 1
No5 2 2 1 2 2
[cMRI data:]
Eighteen had normal; seven had abnormal scans on d4 and d10. Five had mild to severe changes in DNGM
d4, two progressed from mild to moderate on d10. Two grade 1 CGM progressed to grade 2 or 3 on d10.
Two without CGM pathology d4 had mild to moderate on d10. Three had grade 2 or 3 WM findings; one
regressed from grade 3 to 2. Four had abnormal PLIC on d4, two disappeared d10. Two had haemorrhages
on d4 and d10; grade 2 (data not shown in the tbl)
Conclusions: CGM and DNGM lesions progressed from day d4 to day d10, WM and PLIC regressed
slightly from d4 to d10.
