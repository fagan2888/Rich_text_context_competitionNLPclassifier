Abstract
BACKGROUND
Although previous studies have indicated that performance assessments strongly predict
future survival, few have evaluated the incremental value in the presence of controls for
self-reported activity and mobility limitations.
OBJECTIVE
We assess and compare the added value of four tests  walking speed, chair stands, grip
strength, and peak expiratory flow (PEF)  for predicting all-cause mortality.
METHODS
Using population-based samples of older adults in Costa Rica (n = 2290, aged 60+) and
Taiwan (n = 1219, aged 53+), we estimate proportional hazards models of mortality for
an approximate five-year period. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves are
used to assess the prognostic value of each performance assessment.

RESULTS
Self-reported measures of physical limitations contribute substantial gains in mortality
prediction, whereas performance-based assessments yield modest incremental gains.
PEF provides the greatest added value, followed by grip strength. Our results suggest
that including more than two performance assessments may provide little improvement
in mortality prediction.
CONCLUSIONS
PEF and grip strength are often simpler to administer in home interview settings,
impose less of a burden on some respondents, and, in the presence of self-reported
limitations, appear to be better predictors of mortality than do walking speed or chair
stands.
COMMENTS
Being unable to perform the test is often a strong predictor of mortality, but these
indicators are not well-defined. Exclusion rates vary by the specific task and are likely
to depend on the underlying demographic, health, social and cultural characteristics of
the sample.
1. Introduction
The process linking chronic and acute health conditions to disability has been
conceptualized as a progression through four stages: (1) pathology; (2) substantial
impairments; (3) functional limitations (restrictions in basic physical or mental
performance); and (4) disability (difficulties in various activities of daily life,
Verbrugge and Jette 1994). Measures associated with these stages have provided
researchers and health professionals with valuable indicators of the current and future
health status of community-dwelling populations of older adults. Population-based
surveys frequently include measures of the disablement process, either from self-reports
or as interviewed-administered performance tests. Although these two types of
measures  often labeled subjective and objective respectively  are statistically
correlated, they are thought to capture distinct constructs (Reuben et al. 2004).
Nevertheless, both self-reports and performance tasks have been shown to predict
subsequent deterioration in health in diverse settings (Bernard et al. 1997; Cooper et al.
2010; Ferrucci et al. 1991; Gill, Robison, and Tinetti 1998; Guralnik et al. 1995;
Guralnik et al. 2000; Reuben, Siu, and Kimpau 1992; Tinetti et al. 1995).
Each method has advantages and drawbacks. The most frequently used self-
reported measures identify: (1) limitations in performing basic activities of daily living
(ADL) such as bathing or eating, and (2) mobility limitations such as walking or raising
Demographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 229
one's arms. These indicators are easy to collect, inexpensive, and focus on behaviors
that are clinically relevant and signal the need for caregiving (Reuben et al. 2004).
Although the subjective component of self-reports may capture information of
prognostic value, self-reports are likely to be biased by myriad factors (e.g.,
environmental conditions, cultural preferences, or attitudes) that impede comparisons
across populations or subgroups (Melzer et al. 2004) and, given their focus on
functional limitations and especially disability, they are unlikely to identify individuals
in the early stages of impairment (Reuben et al. 2004). Still, they may be better suited
than performance tests to assess individuals' interactions with their immediate
environments and the associated constraints.
Performance assessments, such as grip strength, peak expiratory flow (PEF), chair
stands, and walking speed, are largely determined by physiological functions that
typically decline with age and may underlie frailty (Cooper et al. 2010). Specifically,
walking speed and chair stands reflect lower limb strength and mobility, grip strength is
a marker of overall muscle strength, and peak expiratory flow is an indicator of lung
capacity and airway obstruction. These measurements are considered to have greater
face validity and perhaps reliability than self-reports, and are likely to be more sensitive
to changes over time, more comparable across different contexts, and better suited to
capturing variation across a wide continuum of physical function including early stages
of impairment (Guralnik et al. 1989; Guralnik et al. 1994; Myers et al. 1993); some
suggest that they provide preclinical detection of functional decline (Reuben et al.
2004). The predictive power of performance assessments for future health outcomes
likely results from bi-directional pathways. For example, not only do poor performance
measures appear to be causally related to increased risks of injury and the onset of
disability, but a history of chronic disease and malnutrition is often the source of these
physical impairments (Fried and Guralnik 1997). Despite their utility in health surveys,
performance assessments come at a cost, not only a monetary cost, rather they also
place a burden on the respondent and interviewer. The tests are time-consuming, require
substantial effort for some older or weak respondents, need special equipment and
space for administering, and may compromise response rates for the overall survey.
Thus, the decision about whether to include them in home-based interviews is likely to
depend on their added value beyond information captured by self-reports.
Although there are many potential uses of performance assessments in both
population-based research and clinical practice ­ for example, the identification of
individuals at risk of developing disabilities or requiring institution-based care ­ here
we evaluate these measures only in terms of their prognostic value for survival. We use
survival as our criterion because mortality is the health measure most frequently used to
characterize the overall wellbeing of a population. Moreover, mortality is a well-
defined and salient health outcome with little measurement error. Virtually all of the
Goldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function
230 http://www.demographic-research.org
best quality prognostic indices for predicting survival (e.g., Lee et al. 2006; Schonberg
et al. 2009) include physical function as a key indicator. Indeed, Swindell et al. (2010)
found that five of the ten strongest predictors of mortality (among 377 predictors tested)
were measures of physical function, including both self-reported and performance-
based indicators.
Our primary objective in this paper is to ascertain the incremental improvement
derived from performance tests beyond that provided by self-reported limitations in
predicting mortality. Our secondary objectives are to determine whether some
performance assessments are stronger predictors than others and whether their
predictive power persists with controls for self-reported disease status. As
biodemographic surveys increasingly incorporate performance tests into household
visits, it is important to evaluate the net contribution of these assessments for predicting
survival. To assess the robustness of our findings, we use data from two
population-based surveys of older adults that collected similar information in Taiwan
and in Costa Rica. Although we have no reason to expect the relationship to differ
between these countries, replication of the results in different settings may strengthen
our inferences.
2. Background
There has been little research addressing the central questions in this analysis. Few
studies predicting all-cause mortality in a general population of older adults include
both self-reported and performance-based assessments of physical function. Almost all
existing studies are based in high income countries ­ primarily the US (Al Snih et al.
2002; Cook et al. 1991; Guralnik et al. 1994; Hardy et al. 2007; Markides et al. 2001;
Melzer, Lan, and Guralnik 2003; Reuben et al. 2004), but also Italy (Cesari et al. 2008)
and Australia (Simons et al. 2011). Two exceptions are a study in China (Feng et al.
2010) and another in Costa Rica (Rosero-Bixby and Dow 2012).
Beyond this geographic restriction, the studies described above that include both
self-reported and performance-based measures of physical function as predictors of
total mortality have several drawbacks. First, although most include self-reported ADL
limitations, fewer include self-reported mobility limitations, which afflict adults across
a broader age range. Second, researchers often combine several different performance
assessments into a summary measure, but they do not always evaluate the individual
tests. For example, several of these studies use the Short Physical Performance Battery
(SPPB), which comprises a timed walk, repeated chair stands, and balance stands
(Cesari et al. 2008; Guralnik et al. 1994; Hardy et al. 2007; Markides et al. 2001;
Reuben et al. 2004), and one uses the MOBLI (Index of Mobility-Related Limitations),
Demographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 231
which replaces balance stands with PEF (Melzer, Lan, and Guralnik 2003). Only two of
these studies evaluate all of the underlying individual tests as predictors of mortality
(Cesari et al. 2008; Markides et al. 2001).
Despite variation in the measures collected and in the lengths of follow-up, most
studies find that performance tests predict mortality net of self-reported limitations.
However, perhaps because of variations in study design, researchers disagree about
which tests best predict mortality. For example, Cesari et al. (2008) report chair stands
to be the strongest component of the SPPB in predicting mortality, whereas several
earlier studies identify walking speed (Al Snih et al. 2002; Markides et al. 2001; Ostir et
al. 2007). Rosero-Bixby and Dow (2012) find grip strength to be the strongest predictor
of mortality in women, whereas PEF is the best predictor in men; walking speed is only
marginally significant net of the other covariates. Most studies that have examined grip
strength or PEF in combination with self-reports include few, if any, additional
performance assessments, making it difficult to evaluate these two measures vis-à-vis
the others.
Our study extends the existing literature in two important ways. First, we examine
whether previous findings, based mostly on the US, pertain to two middle income
countries: Taiwan and Costa Rica. Second, we consider a set of four performance tests
to assess whether chair stands or timed walks ­ as some earlier work suggests ­ are the
strongest predictors of mortality, or whether grip strength or PEF, which are often not
part of the most frequently used batteries of tests, perform as well or better. We
hypothesize that grip strength and PEF may perform better because they are likely to be
less correlated with the lower extremity functions captured by the self-reports.
3. Materials and methods
3.1 Data
The data come from the first wave of the Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy
Aging (CRELES) and the second wave of the Social Environment and Biomarkers of
Aging Study (SEBAS). In both surveys, an interview conducted in the respondent's
home included questions related to health and a series of performance-based
assessments. SEBAS and CRELES included informed consent from all participants and
received ethical approval from the human subjects committees at the institutions
conducting the studies.
CRELES is a longitudinal study based on a national sample of residents of Costa
Rica aged 60 and older in 2005, with oversampling of the oldest old (Rosero-Bixby,
Fernández, and Dow 2013). The sample was selected randomly from the 2000 census
Goldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function
232 http://www.demographic-research.org
database using a multi-stage sampling design. For this analysis, we use data from the
first wave conducted between November 2004 and September 2006. Interviews were
completed by 2827 respondents (85 per cent of survivors located).
The SEBAS cohort represents a random subsample of participants in the nationally
representative Taiwan Longitudinal Study of Aging (TLSA); elderly persons and urban
residents were oversampled. The TLSA began in 1989 and younger refresher cohorts
were added in 1996 and 2003; all three cohorts were selected randomly using a multi-
stage sampling design. The sampling frame for the 2006 SEBAS included: a) an older
cohort (aged 60+) of respondents from the 1999 wave of TLSA who completed the
2000 SEBAS medical examination, and b) a younger cohort (aged 5360) of
respondents first interviewed in the 2003 wave of TLSA. Interviews were completed by
1284 respondents aged 53 and older in 2006 (87% response rate). Additional details are
provided elsewhere (Chang et al. 2012).
3.2 Measures
With the exception of mortality, all measures come from the first wave of CRELES
(20042006) and the second wave of SEBAS (2006).
3.2.1 Mortality
For SEBAS, survival status as of June 30, 2011 was ascertained through linkage with
the death certificate file maintained by the Department of Health and the household
registration database maintained by the Ministry of the Interior. Survival status in
CRELES was established in two ways: (1) through the computer records in the National
Death Registry up to December 31, 2010, and (2) during the second (2006-2008) and
third (2008-2010) waves of home visits. The computer follow-up used the unique
identification number (the cédula) that all Costa Ricans have. Five out of the 566 deaths
found in the field were not found in the Registry, suggesting a death under-registration
rate of 1 per cent. In contrast, 10 per cent of the deaths from the Registry were not
found in the field, appearing in the second and third waves as loss of follow-up. For the
foreigners in the sample (approx. 3 per cent), survival was established only in the field
because they did not have a unique identification number with which to link them to the
Registry.
Demographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 233
3.2.2 Measures of physical function
We include two self-reported measures of physical function. Limitations with activities
of daily living (ADL) are based on five ADLs (bathing; eating; toileting; moving
around the house; getting out of bed). We count the number of ADLs (05) that the
respondent reported difficulty performing. The measure of mobility limitations counts
the number of mobility tasks (04) that the respondent reported difficulty performing.
Three of these tasks were similar in both countries (i.e., walking; climbing stairs;
raising his/her arms). In Costa Rica, respondents were asked to demonstrate whether
they could lift their arms above their shoulders; those who did not attempt the activity
are coded as missing. In Taiwan, difficulty raising both hands over the head was based
on self-reports. The fourth self-reported function differed between Costa Rica (i.e.,
pushing or pulling a large object such as a recliner chair) and Taiwan (i.e., lifting or
carrying 1112 kg). In Costa Rica, respondents who reported that they do not do that
activity were coded as missing; this response category was not an option in Taiwan.
Four health assessments were administered by trained interviewers: grip strength,
PEF, timed walk, and chair stands. In each case, the test was coded as missing if the
respondent refused (or in the case of SEBAS, was unable to understand the instructions
or there was equipment failure).
Grip strength (in kg) was measured using a dynamometer (CRELES: Creative
Health Products dynamometer [model T-18]; SEBAS: North CoastTM hydraulic hand
dynamometer [NC70142]); we used the highest level from two trials on the dominant
hand in CRELES and three trials on each hand in SEBAS. The respondent was coded as
unable to perform the test if s/he: a) met the exclusion criteria for both hands; b) tried
but was unable to do the test; c) did not attempt the test for safety reasons; d) (in
CRELES only) was not tested because of disability; e) (in SEBAS only) did not attempt
the test because of weakness, stroke, or frailty or stopped because of pain or discomfort.
The exclusion criteria included: surgery on hand/wrist/arm in the past three months and
(in SEBAS only) recent injury, worsening pain, swelling, inflammation, or severe pain
in the hand/wrist.
Lung function, represented by PEF (L/min), was based on the maximum of three
trials using a peak flow meter (CRELES: Mini Wright; SEBAS: TruZone®). In
CRELES, the unable group included respondents who were unable to complete even
one trial. In SEBAS, the respondent was coded as unable if: a) s/he met the exclusion
criteria (i.e., surgery on chest/abdomen or hospitalized for a heart problem in the past
six weeks; detached retina or eye surgery in past six months; hospitalized for
respiratory or lung infection in past three weeks), b) s/he did not attempt the test
because of stroke or illness, or c) s/he or the interviewer felt it was unsafe.
Goldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function
234 http://www.demographic-research.org
To measure walking speed (m/sec), the respondents were asked to walk three
meters at their normal speed. The respondent started from a sitting position in CRELES
and a standing position in SEBAS. CRELES included one trial; SEBAS conducted two
trials (we used the faster of the two). The respondent was coded as unable to
complete the test if s/he: a) tried but was unable to do the test; b) did not attempt the test
for safety reasons; or c) (in CRELES only) reported any problem that would impair
him/her from doing a mobility and flexibility test.
For the chair stand test, the respondent was asked to stand up and sit down again
five times in a row as quickly as possible without stopping while keeping his/her arms
folded across his/her chest. For those able to complete five stands, the completion time
was recorded. To adjust for differences in chair height, we regressed the completion
time (ci
) for individual i on chair height (hi
) controlling for the respondent's age and
height (SEBAS)/knee height (CRELES), with models fit separately by sex (Cornman et
al. 2011). The adjusted completion time was calculated as )

to perform the test if s/he: a) met the exclusion criteria (CRELES: reported any problem
that would impair him/her from doing a mobility and flexibility test; SEBAS: was in a
wheelchair); b) tried but was unable to complete five stands, or c) did not attempt the
test for safety reasons.
3.2.3 Control variables
All models include controls for age, sex, education, and urban residence. In auxiliary
analyses, we also control for several other variables that may be associated with both
physical function and mortality: self-reported measures of specific health conditions
(i.e., cancer, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, respiratory disease, arthritis, hypertension);
smoking status (never, former, current); exercise (3+ times per week); and
hospitalization in the past year.
3.3 Analytical strategy
Among those interviewed, 19.0 per cent of the CRELES sample and 5.1 per cent of the
SEBAS sample are missing data for a measure of physical function, either self-reported
(n=410 in CRELES; n=6 in SEBAS) or performance-based (n=164 in CRELES; n=59
Demographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 235
in SEBAS). Exclusion of these respondents leaves an analysis sample of 2290 for Costa
Rica and 1219 for Taiwan. In order to ascertain the robustness of the results to the
treatment of missing data, we use multiple imputation to re-estimate the final models
for the full samples.
Descriptive statistics are weighted to account for oversampling and for differential
response rates by age, sex, and other covariates. Survival models are fit separately by
country using unweighted data. We estimate age-specific mortality using a Gompertz
proportional hazards model with time measured in terms of age. The Gompertz function
assumes that the force of mortality increases exponentially with age and generally fits
very well at older ages (Horiuchi and Coale 1982). In initial tests (not shown), the age
slope of mortality () did not differ significantly by sex in these samples.
Some of the performance tests are strongly correlated with one another (e.g.,
among those with measurements, the Pearson correlations between grip strength and
PEF are 0.60 in CRELES and 0.65 in SEBAS, and correlations between walking speed
and chair stand speed are 0.37 in CRELES and 0.51 in SEBAS). Thus, we model the
performance assessments individually as well as jointly. Our models are fit in two
stages. First, we estimate a model that includes only self-reported ADL and mobility
limitations in addition to sociodemographic controls. Next, we fit a series of models
that add a performance test, with a categorical specification: those unable to perform a
given test are assigned a separate category, and the remaining responses are recoded
into quartiles based on the weighted distribution of the pooled samples. These models
are not designed to reflect causal processes but rather to evaluate the prognostic value
of performance assessments over and above that of self-reported measures of physical
function.
To evaluate the predictive ability of different measures of physical function, we
compare the model-based predicted probability of dying by the end of follow-up (see
Supplementary Material for details) with the observed binary outcome (death vs.
survival) to estimate the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve
(AUC). The AUC is the most popular measure of discrimination and can be interpreted
as the probability that those who actually died are assigned a higher predicted
probability of death than are their counterparts who survived (Pencina and D'Agostino
2004). We use the rocgold procedure in Stata 12.1 to test whether the addition of
performance assessments yields a significant improvement in mortality prediction.
Similarly, we compare the AUC from models that include individual performance tests
to determine whether some assessments are better predictors than others. We present
both the absolute increase in AUC between pairs of nested models as well as the
increase in AUC for a given model as a percentage of the area above the curve (i.e., (1-
AUC) or the fraction of incorrect predictions) for the simpler model.
Goldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function
236 http://www.demographic-research.org
Finally, to help gauge the magnitude of the association with mortality, we calculate
the predicted probability of dying between exact ages 70 and 75 (
70
5
^
q ) for selected
levels of performance. This age interval corresponds roughly to the mean age at the
time of the survey (69.3) and at the end of follow-up (74.3) for the pooled sample
(weighted). These probabilities are estimated by setting the selected performance
assessment at the specified value, fixing all other covariates at the weighted mean for
the pooled sample, and using the model coefficients to predict the probability of dying
between exact ages 70 and 75 (see Supplementary Material for details). For each
performance test, we provide two sets of predicted probabilities. The first is based on a
model that includes only the selected performance assessment and sociodemographic
controls, thus representing the gross effect without adjusting for any other measures
of physical function. The second is based on a model that includes all physical function
measures (both self-reported and performance-based) in addition to control variables
and thus, represents the net effect after adjusting for the effects of all other measures
of physical function.
4. Results
In CRELES, there were 569 deaths by January 1, 2011; the average length of mortality
follow-up was 5.2 years (max., 6.2 years). For SEBAS, there were 140 deaths by June
30, 2011; mean follow-up was 4.7 years (max., 4.9 years). The Costa Rican sample is
older than the Taiwanese sample (Table 1), reflecting differences in the sampled
population (60+ for CRELES, 53+ for SEBAS). A small proportion of respondents
report any of the five ADL limitations (11 per cent in Costa Rica, 7 per cent in Taiwan),
suggesting low rates of severe disability in these populations. Functional limitations are
more frequent: a sizeable proportion report at least one of the four mobility limitations
(55 per cent in Costa Rica; 33 per cent in Taiwan; not shown). The performance-based
tests capture more subtle variations in physical capability. For example, even among
those who report no ADL or mobility limitations, there is wide variation in performance
(e.g., grip strength ranges from 5 to 58 kg in Costa Rica; 4 to 68 kg in Taiwan; not
shown). Thus, although the performance tests are moderately correlated with the self-
reported measures (r = -0.13 to -0.52), they are more likely to capture early stages of
impairment before a limitation would be acknowledged with standard questionnaires.

In the hazard models that include only self-reported measures (Model 1, Tables 2
and 3), mobility limitations are associated with higher mortality rates in both Costa
Rica (HR=1.29, p<0.001) and Taiwan (HR=1.50, p<0.001), but ADL limitations are
significant only in Costa Rica (HR=1.22, p<0.001). In models that add a single
performance test (Models 2a-2d), joint Wald chi-square tests (based on the four
Goldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function
238 http://www.demographic-research.org
parameters for a given assessment) indicate that each of the four performance tests is
significantly associated with mortality in Costa Rica, but only grip strength and PEF are
significantly associated with mortality in Taiwan. The fact that the sample size in Costa
Rica is more than twice that in Taiwan accounts for the significance of some estimates
for Costa Rica even when the magnitudes of the hazard ratios are similar to or smaller
than the corresponding values in Taiwan.
The hazard ratios are substantially attenuated when all performance tests are
included in a single model (Model 5, Tables 2 and 3). Grip strength and PEF continue
to be significantly related to mortality in both countries, but walking speed and chair
stand speed are not. Being unable to perform the PEF test is a particularly strong
predictor of mortality (HR=2.6 in Costa Rica; HR=5.2 in Taiwan relative to those in the
top quartile). Poor PEF performance (bottom quartile) also strongly predicts mortality
in both countries (HRs>2). In addition to the models presented in Tables 2 and 3, we
estimated an auxiliary model that includes controls for specific health conditions,
smoking, exercise, and hospitalization. Although the coefficients for PEF weaken
slightly with the inclusion of these variables, both PEF and grip strength remain strong
predictors of mortality (results not shown). We also used multiple imputation to re-
estimate these same models for the full samples (n=2827 in Costa Rica, n=1284 in
Taiwan). The coefficients from these models are very similar to those shown in Tables
2 and 3.
Comparisons of the AUC for different models show that self-reported measures of
physical function yield a substantial and significant improvement in mortality
prediction compared with a baseline model that adjusts only for sociodemographic
characteristics -- the increase in AUC is greater than 10 per cent of the area above the
curve (1-AUC) for the baseline model in both countries (Table 4). Beyond the
prognostic value of self-reported physical function, PEF provides the greatest
improvement in predictive ability in both countries; the other three performance
assessments produce smaller improvements that are significant only in Costa Rica.

A ranking of the four assessments in terms of the absolute increment in AUC
results in the following order of performance measures, from largest to smallest: PEF,
grip strength, walking speed, and chair stands. This ordering is used to evaluate whether
successive additions of assessments provide substantial improvements in mortality
Goldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function
242 http://www.demographic-research.org
prediction. Based on the criterion of 0.01 to indicate a meaningful improvement in the
AUC (Pencina et al. 2008), PEF appears to be a useful measure (the gain in AUC
equaled 0.015 in Taiwan and was just below 0.01 in Costa Rica). Compared with PEF
alone (Model 2b), the addition of each of the other three performance assessments
(Models 3a3c) yields a similar increase in AUC in Costa Rica (0.004). In Taiwan, grip
strength (Model 3a) and walking speed (Model 3b) lead to the largest increases in AUC,
while chair stand speed results in a more modest improvement in AUC.
Table 5 shows the extent of variation in the predicted probability of dying between
exact ages 70 and 75 (
70
5
^
q ) by selected levels of performance on the physical
assessments. Differences are particularly large for grip strength and PEF. For example,
the gross effect for PEF (i.e., before adjusting for the effects of other measures of
physical function) suggests that 28 per cent of Costa Ricans who were unable to
perform the test would be expected to die between ages 70 and 75 compared with only
6 per cent of those in the top quartile; corresponding figures for Taiwan are 37 per cent
vs. 4 per cent. After adjustment for the contribution of other physical function
measures, the net effect for PEF is smaller, but remains substantial (Costa Rica: 17 per
cent of unable vs. 7 per cent in the top quartile; Taiwan: 22 per cent vs. 5 per cent,
respectively). Some of the differences are large even without considering those who
were unable to complete the tests. For example, in both countries, the net effect of PEF
on mortality is twice as high for those in the bottom compared with the top quartile.
In auxiliary models (not shown), we explored whether the assessments are more
predictive for older (70+) than for younger (<70) persons and for men than women ­
results which would be consistent with tentative findings from a meta-analysis (Cooper
et al. 2010). In line with results from the EPESE study in the US (Reuben et al. 2004),
we also considered whether performance tests have greater prognostic value among
those who report themselves to be highly functioning (i.e., no self-reported limitations)
compared with those reporting limitations. Among the many interactions tested, few
were significant, close to what we would expect by chance. Thus, we found little
evidence that the prognostic value of the performance tests differs by age, sex or the
presence of self-reported limitations.

5. Discussion
Health interview surveys routinely ask respondents about their physical limitations, but
they are much less likely to measure respondents' physical performance with trained
observers, presumably because of the expense, complex logistics, and burden for
participants. Because it is easier to obtain self-reports than to administer performance
tasks, it is important to ascertain the additional value derived from such tests. Of course,
their value depends in large part on the particular questions being addressed. In this
analysis we consider only one criterion: the prognostic value of four types of
performance tests over and above self-reported limitations for five-year mortality. For
two population-based samples of older individuals living in the community, we find
that PEF and grip strength (and gait speed in Costa Rica) yield sizeable improvements
in mortality prediction above and beyond self-reported limitations. The gains in
prediction are stronger in Taiwan than in Costa Rica but, because of the smaller sample
size, are less likely to be statistically significant in Taiwan.
The paucity of previous studies addressing this issue, combined with variability
across data sets in the measures collected, has yielded few robust findings. One study
suggested that the chair stand test provided the strongest mortality prediction (Cesari et
al. 2008), while other work favored walking speed (Al Snih et al. 2002; Markides et al.
2001), and yet another study reported that grip strength had the biggest effect in women
and PEF had the biggest effect in men (Rosero-Bixby and Dow 2012). None of these
prior studies included all four performance tests. Our findings, which are remarkably
similar in Taiwan and Costa Rica, reveal that for both countries  in the presence of
controls for self-reported ADL and mobility limitations  PEF has the strongest
association with mortality. In models that include all four assessments, PEF and grip
strength measures significantly predict mortality, whereas chair stand and walking
speed do not. The discrepancies between our results and previous findings are likely
due to two factors. One relates to the batteries of tests used in the earlier studies: chair
stands and walking speed were generally included, whereas grip strength and PEF were
not. A second explanation is that previous studies controlled for self-reported ADL
limitations, but not mobility limitations. Tabulations (not shown) indicated that, when
we omitted controls for self-reported limitations, the advantage of PEF and grip
strength relative to the other two performance tasks was diminished, particularly in
Costa Rica. This result is not surprising, as ADL limitations, mobility limitations, chair
stand speed, and walking speed all reflect lower extremity function.
Many studies have examined the links between PEF or grip strength and mortality
(although only a few have done so in conjunction with other performance tests and self-
reported limitations). Most have found strong and robust associations between each of
these two performance tasks and all-cause mortality (Cook et al. 1991; Cooper et al.
Demographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 245
2010; Rosero-Bixby and Dow 2012; Simons et al. 2011; Vaz Fragoso et al. 2008).
Although explanations for these strong links remain unclear (Gale et al. 2007; Schrack,
Simonsick, and Ferrucci 2010), multiple mechanisms are likely to be involved.
Rantanen et al. (2003) argue that grip strength, which reflects overall muscle strength,
predicts survival in part because of chronic diseases that result in muscle
impairment via such mechanisms as nutritional deficiency, inflammation, physical
inactivity, and depression. However, even in the absence of recognizable disease, weak
muscle strength may increase susceptibility to injury and compromise subsequent
healing (Rantanen et al. 2003). It could also reflect early life nutrition and fetal
development (Gale et al. 2007; Rantanen et al. 2003) or be a marker of subclinical
disease (Rantanen et al. 2003). Similarly, Vaz Fragoso et al. (2008) suggest that a
diminished PEF reflects more than chronic lung disease or exposure to smoke or
pollution; for example, low PEF may indicate impaired respiratory muscle strength,
upper-extremity functional limitations, and poor cognitive function. Both PEF and grip
strength are thought to capture a person's overall vigor or vitality (Cook et al. 1991).
Despite the cost of specialized equipment, both measures have some advantages as risk
assessment tools in household surveys, particularly in developing countries: Unlike
chair stands, there is no need to adjust for differences in chair size; in contrast to the
timed walk, they do not require unobstructed space; and there is no need to time
performance, which may increase measurement error. Nevertheless, accurate
measurements of all four performance assessments necessitate careful interviewer
training and calibration of instruments.
One limitation of this study is the attrition of respondents due to loss to follow-up
and mortality. As with any study of older populations, the analysis is restricted to those
who survived to the age range targeted by the survey. In the case of the Taiwanese
survey, there was also attrition resulting from loss to follow-up during the course of the
longitudinal study. A second disadvantage  as with any application of performance
tasks  is that some respondents are unwilling or unable to participate or they are
excluded because of health and safety concerns. This proportion is much lower for grip
strength (5 per cent in SEBAS; 11 per cent in CRELES) than for chair stands (12 per
cent and 27 per cent, respectively). As indicated by the hazard ratios in Tables 2 and 3,
being unable to perform a test (including those excluded for health reasons) is often a
strong predictor of impending death. However, these indicators are not well-defined:
Exclusion rates vary by the specific task and are likely to depend on the underlying
demographic, health, social, and cultural characteristics of the sample. They are also
likely to differ by the degree of caution and safety concerns of the survey investigators,
thereby generating variability across surveys in the strength of the association between
these variables and health status. A third concern is limited statistical power,
Goldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function
246 http://www.demographic-research.org
particularly in Taiwan, where numerous estimates are substantial but not statistically
significant.
Few researchers question the importance of collecting self-reported data on
physical limitations in older populations. In this study we demonstrate the utility of
performance assessments, even when high quality self-reported measures are available.
Nonetheless, our findings indicate that it may not be necessary or cost effective to
collect a large battery of performance tests, in part because of substantial correlations
among the tasks. For predicting mortality in community-based populations  at least
within a five-year period  measurements of PEF and grip strength may suffice.
Although our findings are reinforced by the consistency of estimates for Costa Rica and
Taiwan, future work should examine the robustness of these results to different settings
and populations, and, most importantly, to alternative health outcomes. For example, it
is quite possible that performance measures that are redundant for predicting mortality
are strong predictors of future disability. With the recent expansion of data collection in
longitudinal household surveys, future analyses should also assess the predictive power
of changes in performance between survey waves, which may enhance models of health
and survival beyond what can ascertained from cross-sectional measures. They may
also add prognostic value to models that include changes in self-reported health and
functional ability as well as changes in physiological markers (e.g., biomarkers of the
cardiovascular or immune system).
