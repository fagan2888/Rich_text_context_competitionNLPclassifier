Abstract
Objective: To investigate the downstream target genes regulated by the nitric oxide­soluble
guanylate cyclase­cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-sGC-cGMP) signal pathway and their
possible roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH).
Methods: Digital gene expression tag profiling was performed to identify genes that are
differentially expressed after activation of the NO-sGC-cGMP signal pathway in human pulmonary
artery smooth muscles cells using 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate, BAY 41-2272 and
BAY 60-2770. Results were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gene ontology
and signal transduction network analyses were also performed.
Results: A number of genes were differentially expressed, including MMP1, SERPINB2, GREM1 and
IL8. A total of 68 gene ontology terms and seven pathways were found to be associated with these
genes. Most of these genes are involved in cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis, which
may contribute to the pathological pulmonary vascular remodelling in PH.
Conclusion: These results may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PH.

Introduction
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious
disease characterized by elevated blood
pressure in the pulmonary artery, pulmon-
ary vein or pulmonary capillaries, leading to
shortness of breath, dizziness, weakness and
even symptoms of shock symptoms such as
fainting.1 Without treatment, the disorder
will progress rapidly to right heart failure
and death within 3 years of diagnosis.
The pathogenesis of PH is not completely
understood, but multiple studies have sug-
gested that an imbalance of vasocon-
striction/vasodilation and proliferation/
antiproliferation may be involved.2 Nitric
oxide (NO), which is produced by NO
synthase from L-arginine, is an important
vascular modulator in the development of
PH. It exerts its biological activity mainly by
activating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)
to synthesize the second messenger cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP),3 which
promotes vasodilation and inhibits smooth
muscle cell growth and proliferation, neur-
onal transmission, host defences, leukocyte
recruitment, platelet aggregation and vascu-
lar remodelling through a number of down-
stream targets.4
Impairment of the NO-sGC-cGMP path-
way, associated with dysregulation of NO
production, sGC activity and cGMP deg-
radation, has been shown to contribute to
the progression of PH.5 A number of sGC
stimulators and activators that can bind to
the b subunit of sGC and stimulate it in a
direct or indirect way have been identified,
including 3-(50-hydroxymethyl-20-furyl)-1-
benzyl indazole (YC-1), 3-(4-amino-5-cyclo-
propylpyrimidin-2-yl)-1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-
1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine (BAY 41-2272),
2-[1-[(2-fluorophenyl)methyl]-1H-pyrazolo
[3,4-b]pyridin-3-yl]-5-(4-morpholinyl)-4,6-
pyrimidinediamine (BAY 41-8543) and rio-
ciguat (BAY 63-2521).6,7 They can act as
potent pulmonary vasodilators, decreasing
the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and
vascular resistance, and have been shown to
reverse structural lung vascular remodelling
and right heart hypertrophy in PH.8
Riociguat is the first sGC stimulator to
undergo clinical study. In clinical trials
it significantly improved the pulmonary
vascular haemodynamics in pulmonary
arterial hypertension and chronic thrombo-
embolic PH with no serious adverse events.9
In contrast, a specific inhibitor of sGC,
1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one,
has been shown to block the rise in cGMP
and the antiproliferative action of the
NO-sGC-cGMP pathway.10
To date, studies suggest that once cGMP
is produced, its effects could be executed
though three main groups of cellular target
molecules: cGMP-dependent protein kin-
ases (PKGs), cGMP-gated cation channels
and phosphodiesterases (PDEs).11 The PDE
inhibitor sildenafil is used to treat idiopathic
PH.12,13 However, besides these three
groups of molecules, little is known about
the downstream target genes of the
NO-sGC-cGMP pathway and the signalling
events regulating gene expression. Using
genome-wide technologies that can measure
the expression of thousands of genes simul-
taneously, differences in gene expression in
response to particular treatments can be
measured. In the present study, digital gene
expression tag profiling was used to measure
differences in gene expression in human
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells
treated with two sGC agonists14 and a
Zou et al. 509
cGMP analogue.15 Gene ontology analysis
of the differential gene expression was then
used to reveal the candidate genes involved
in the activation of NO-sGC-cGMP
pathway.
Materials and methods
Digital gene expression tag profiling
Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle
cells isolated from patients with PH were
generously provided by Dr Jun Wang from
Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.
They were cultured in smooth muscle cell
medium (ScienCell Research Laboratories,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 2%
fetal bovine serum and 1% smooth muscle
cell growth supplement (ScienCell Research
Laboratories) and maintained at 37C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon diox-
ide. The sGC agonists BAY 41-2272 (an
NO-independent but haem-dependent sGC
stimulator) and BAY 60-2770 (an NO- and
haem-independent sGC activator) for digital
gene expression tag profiling were gener-
ously provided by Professor Johannes-Peter
Stasch from Bayer Schering Pharma AG,
Cardiology Research, Pharma Research
Centre, Germany. These were dissolved in
dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at a concen-
tration of 100 mmol/l and stored at À20C
until used.
Smooth muscle cells (1 Â 106) were trea-
ted with 2 ml of 100 mmol/l BAY 41-2272
for 8 h, 0.2 ml of 10 mmol/l BAY 41-2272 for
24 h, 0.2 ml of 10 mmol/l BAY 60-2770 for
24 h, or 2 ml of 100 mmol/l 8-bromo-cGMP
(8-Br-cGMP; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,
USA) for 8 h. Controls were treated with
DMSO (2 ml or 0.2 ml as controls for BAY
41-2272 and BAY 60-2770, respectively) or
2 ml double-distilled H2
O (controls for 8-
Br-cGMP) for the same time periods. The
cells (2 Â 106) were then harvested at the
indicated time points.
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol
reagent according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Magnetic oligo-beads were used to
isolate the mRNA from 6 mg of total RNA.
First- and second-strand cDNA was synthe-
sized using oligo(dT) primers, purified using
a Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions, and digested with
DNase I in order to produce a substantial
enrichment of fragments about 200 bp in
length. The samples (20 ml) were then loaded
onto 1.2% agarose gel (Invitrogen) and
fragments between 100 and 300 bp were
extracted using a Qiaquick Gel Extraction
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufac-
turer's instructions. The 50 and 30 ends of
the fragments were end-repaired. The sam-
ples were purified and ligated to genomic
adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)
and then loaded onto 2% agarose gel and
separated by electrophoresis (120 V for
30 min), and the fragments between 100
and 300 bp were isolated from the gel and
purified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction
Kit. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of
the gel-purified cDNA (total volume 50 ml)
was performed using DNA polymerase and
primers provided by Illumina according to
the manufacturer's instructions. After 15
cycles of PCR amplification, the sample
were loaded onto 1.2% agarose gels and
fragments between 100 and 300 bp were
purified from the gel again. The samples
were then quantified spectrophotomet-
rically using a NanoDrop spectrophotom-
eter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) and sequenced using a HiSeqTM
2000 system (Illumina).16,17
Determination of differentially
expressed genes
To compare the differential expression of
genes across samples, the raw data was
collected and filtered to remove low quality
tags, adaptor tags and tags with a single
copy number. The gene expression levels
510 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
were determined by the number of raw clean
tags in each library normalized to the tran-
scripts per million clean tags. A significant
difference was defined as a P-value < 0.05, a
false discovery rate 0.001 and a ratio !2
for the sequence counts across the libraries.
Upregulated genes were defined as >2.0 Â
expression in controls, and downregulated
genes were defined as <0.5 Â expression in
controls.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
to validate the digital gene expression
results. Human pulmonary artery smooth
muscle cells for quantitative real-time PCR
were purchased from ScienCell Research
Laboratories and were cultured in the same
smooth muscle cell medium as described
above. Smooth muscle cells (1 Â 106) were
treated with 2 ml of 100 mmol/l BAY 41-2272
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 8 h. Controls were
treated with 2 ml DMSO for the same time
period. The cells (2 Â 106) were then
harvested.
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol
reagent according to the manufacturer's
instructions. First-strand cDNA was gener-
ated with random primers using a
SuperScriptTM First-Strand Synthesis
System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Real-
time PCR was performed using the iQ5
Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection
System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA, USA) with SYBRÕ Premix Ex
TaqTM II (Takara Biotech Co., Dalian,
China) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The target genes were MMP1,
SERPINB2, GREM1, IL8 and actin. The
two-step PCR protocol included one cycle of
95C for 30 s, and 40 cycles of 95C for 5 s
and 60C for 30 s. The PCR reaction
required 9.9 ml of distilled water, 12.5 ml of
2 Â SYBRÕ Premix Ex TaqTM II, 0.8 ml of
each primer, and 1 ml of DNA template in a
total volume of 25 ml. Experiments were
performed in triplicate and were repeated
at least three times. The threshold cycle (Ct)
values for relative quantification of gene
expression were calculated using the 2ÀÁÁCt
method and normalized to b-actin. The PCR
primers for MMP1 were GGTCTCTGAG
GGTCAAGCAG (forward) and AGTTCA
TGAGCTGCAACACG (reverse). The pri-
mers for SERPINB2 were ATGGTCTACA
TGGGCTCCAG (forward) and CGCAGA
CTTCTCACCAAACA (reverse). The pri-
mers for GREM1 were GCTCTGGCATTC
AGAGAACC (forward) and AAATTCGC
CTAGCGTGAGAA (reverse). The primers
for IL8 were TAGCAAAATTGAGGCCA
AGG (forward) and AAACCAAGGCAC
AGTGGAAC (reverse). The primers for the
actin gene were GGCGGCACCACCATG
TACCCT (forward) and AGGGGCCGG
ACTCGTCATACT (reverse).
Gene ontology analysis of the differentially
expressed genes
Gene ontology (GO) analysis is a commonly
used technique to determine the main func-
tions of differentially expressed genes
according to the GO database.18 A P-value
was determined for the GO terms and a
corrected P-value calculated for the differ-
entially expressed genes as follows:
P ¼ 1 À
X
mÀ1
i¼o
M
i
 
N À M
n À i
 
N
n
 
where N is the total number of genes with
that GO term, n is the number of genes with
that GO term in the differentially expressed
genes, M is the total number of genes within
the particular GO category, m is the number
of genes within the particular GO category
in the differentially expressed genes, and i is
the number from 0 to m À 1. The threshold
of significance was defined as a corrected
P-value < 0.05.
Zou et al. 511
Pathway analysis of the differentially
expressed genes
Pathway analysis was based on the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG), a comprehensive pathway-related
database.19 P-values were calculated using
the above equation, where N is the total
number of genes with that pathway annota-
tion, n is the number of genes with that
pathway annotation in the differentially
expressed genes, M is the total number of
genes within the particular pathway cat-
egory, m is the number of genes within the
particular pathway category in the differen-
tially expressed genes, and i is the number
from 0 to m À 1. The threshold of signifi-
cance was defined as a Q-value 0.05, where
the Q-value is an analogue of the P-value
incorporating false discovery rate-based
multiple testing correction.
Statistical analyses
All data were expressed as the mean Æ SD.
Differential gene expression levels were
based on log2
ratios among the different
groups. Statistical comparisons were per-
formed using the Student's t-test for analyz-
ing two-group data. The threshold of
significance was defined as a P-value < 0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS software version 13 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Differentially expressed genes
Compared with controls, 539 upregulated
genes and 367 downregulated genes were
identified in cells treated with 8-Br-cGMP,
and 993 upregulated genes and 1002 down-
regulated genes were identified in cells
treated with BAY 41-2272 (100 mmol/l for
8 h) (Figure 1). In addition, 219 and 143
genes were significantly upregulated and 353
and 351 genes were significantly downregu-
lated after treatment with BAY 41-2272
(10 mmol/l for 24 h) and BAY 60-2770
(10 mmol/l for 24 h), respectively. A total of
84 of the upregulated genes and 87 of the
downregulated genes showed similar vari-
ation trends in all four groups, suggesting
that activation of the NO-sGC-cGMP path-
way might affect expression of a group of
important downstream factors. Nine genes
that were significantly up- or downregulated
compared with controls when the NO-sGC-
cGMP pathway was activated are shown
in Table 1. Interestingly, these differentially
expressed genes are involved in the

degradation of the extracellular matrix, the
response to wounding and cell adhesion,
which are closely related to the pathogenic
processes of PH.
Validation of the differentially
expressed genes
The potential candidate genes identified
using digital gene expression tag profiling
were validated using specific primer-based
methods. Expression of mRNA levels for
genes that were upregulated in the digital
gene expression analysis and that may play
important roles in regulating extracellular
matrix degradation, cell proliferation and
angiogenesis were measured using quantita-
tive real-time PCR. Gene expression in
human pulmonary artery smooth muscle
cells treated with BAY 41-2272 (100 mmol/l
for 8 h) is shown in Figure 2. Expression of
MMP1, SERPINB2, GREM1 and IL8
was clearly significantly upregulated after
BAY 41-2272 treatment compared with
control cells.
GO analysis of differentially
expressed genes
Gene ontology analysis is widely used to
describe the molecular functions, cellular
components and biological processes of
differentially expressed genes in a micro-
array. As the variation trends of most of
the differentially expressed genes were
similar in the four treatment groups, GO
analysis of the biological process was
only performed in the group treated with
BAY 41-2272 (100 mmol/l for 8 h). A total
of 68 GO items associated with the differ-
entially expressed genes were identified
(Table 2). Regulation and negative regula-
tion of cellular process, negative regu-
lation of biological process and regulation
of cellular macromolecule biosynthetic
process were the most significantly
enriched items (low P-value) (Table 2).
Moreover, other items associated with the
progression of PH such as cell proliferation,
cell migration and apoptosis were also
enriched.

Pathway analysis of differentially
expressed genes
To investigate which signal transduction
pathways were involved in PH, related
pathways were analyzed according to the
molecular interaction and reaction networks
of the differentially expressed genes in the
group treated with BAY 41-2272 (100mmol/l
for 8 h). From this KEGG pathway analysis,
a large number of significant pathways were
identified (Table 3). A variety of signalling
pathways were significantly affected, includ-
ing pathways in cancer, p53 signalling path-
way, nucleotide oligomerization domain
(NOD)-like receptor signalling pathway,
malaria, mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signalling pathway, base excision
repair and basal cell carcinoma.
Discussion
Despite several advances in therapy, there is
currently no curative treatment for PH and
its pathophysiology is only partially under-
stood. cGMP, produced by activation of the
NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, is a key regulator
of vascular smooth muscle cell contractility,
growth and differentiation, and has been
shown to be associated with PH.4 However,
the regulation of gene expression by cGMP
and the physiological effects and functions
of cGMP remain to be fully defined.
In the present study, human pulmonary
artery smooth muscle cells were treated with
8-Br-cGMP, BAY 41-2272 and BAY 60-
2770, activators of the NO-sGC-cGMP path-
way, to investigate PH-related differentially
expressed genes and signalling pathways.
Using digital gene expression tag profiling,
a group of downstream genes that are pos-
sibly regulated by cGMP were identified.
Among the differentially expressed genes
detected by Illumina sequencing and con-
firmed by quantitative real-time PCR,
MMP1, SERPINB2, GREM1 and IL8 were
identified as candidate marker genes that
may be crucial in PH development.

MMP1 encodes matrix metalloprotease-1,
a member of the matrix metalloprotease
(MMP) family, which are the major prote-
ases involved in tissue remodelling of the
extracellular matrix by degrading all types
of matrix components.20 MMPs play an
important role in cell proliferation, differen-
tiation, migration, angiogenesis, apoptosis
and host defences. Numerous studies have
suggested that adjustment of the ratio
between MMPs and tissue inhibitors of
MMPs could potentiate reverse vascular
remodelling in PH.21 Therefore, understand-
ing the dysregulated expression of MMP1
may provide crucial insights into pulmonary
vascular remodelling.
SERPINB2, also known as the plasmino-
gen activator inhibitor-2 gene (PAI-2),
encodes a member of a large family of
serine protease inhibitors (serpins), which
are known to be key regulators of cell
proliferation, differentiation, complement
activation and apoptosis.22­25 PAI-1,
another member of the serpin family, has
been shown to be significantly downregu-
lated in pulmonary artery smooth muscle
cells in IPAH and negatively regulates pul-
monary artery smooth muscle cell prolifer-
ation, suggesting that its downregulation
may contribute to pathological vascular
remodelling in IPAH.26 In the present
study, PAI-2 (SERPINB2) was shown to
be one of the downstream genes affected by
the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway; it is possible
that PAI-2 may have a similar function to
PAI-1 and could alleviate or reverse the
vascular remodelling in PH through the
regulation of cell proliferation and apop-
tosis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle
cells.

GREM1 encodes a member of the bone
morphogenic protein antagonist family. It
may play a role in regulating organogenesis,
body patterning and tissue differentiation.27
IL8 encodes interleukin-8, also known as
CXCL8, which is a chemokine produced by
macrophages and other cell types that is an
important mediator of the immune reaction
in the innate immune system response.28 The
functions of GREM1 and IL8 in PH have
not been reported and their roles require
further investigation.
In the light of the results of the present
study, further investigations into the expres-
sion and functions of the protein products of
these genes in PH using a greater number of
samples are warranted.
To better understand the molecular
events involved in the development of PH,
functional enrichment analysis of the dif-
ferentially expressed genes was performed.
The results indicated that the enriched
biological processes and pathways were
very similar following activation of the
NO-sGC-cGMP pathway irrespective of
the activating agent. Using GO analysis,
regulation of cellular process, biological
process and cellular macromolecule bio-
synthetic process were the most signifi-
cantly enriched items in the present study.
Pathway analysis can reveal the distinct
biological processes and identify signalling
pathways; in the present study, enriched
categories included pathways in cancer,
p53 signalling pathway, NOD-like receptor
signalling pathway, malaria, MAPK signal-
ling pathway, base excision repair and basal
cell carcinoma. Interestingly, a number of
these pathways (pathways in cancer, p53
signalling pathway and MAPK signalling
pathway) are involved in cell proliferation,
cell differentiation and cell apoptosis,29,30
which have been reported to be associated
with the vascular remodelling seen during
PH progression.31,32 These differentially
expressed genes may be potent regula-
tors of pulmonary artery smooth muscle
cells and dysregulation may lead to
the development of pulmonary vascular
remodelling.
The differentially expressed genes identi-
fied in the present study are probably
important contributors to the pathogenesis
of PH. However, how cGMP regulates these
differentially expressed genes and how these
genes regulate vascular remodelling needs to
be further investigated. The functions of the
other items identified by pathway analysis
may also play a role in PH that has not been
elucidated yet. Validation and investigation
of the downregulated genes will be under-
taken in the future.
In conclusion, the present study identified
some differentially expressed genes and
related pathways regulated by the NO-
sGC-cGMP signal pathway, and found
that most of the differentially expressed
genes were involved in cell proliferation,
cell migration and apoptosis, which might
contribute to the pathological pulmonary
vascular remodelling in PH. These results
may provide a novel insight into the molecu-
lar mechanisms of PH, especially those
involved in pulmonary vascular remodel-
ling. Further studies on these identified
genes and signalling pathways may lead to
the discovery of new drug targets for PH
therapy.
