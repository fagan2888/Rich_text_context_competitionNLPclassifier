Abstract
To explore the co-evolution of friendship tie choice and alcohol use behavior among 1,284
adolescents from 12 small schools and 976 adolescents from one big school sampled in the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (AddHealth), we apply a Stochas-
tic Actor-Based (SAB) approach implemented in the R-based Simulation Investigation for
Empirical Network Analysis (RSiena) package. Our results indicate the salience of both
peer selection and peer influence effects for friendship tie choice and adolescent drinking
behavior. Concurrently, the main effect models indicate that parental monitoring and the pa-
rental home drinking environment affected adolescent alcohol use in the small school sam-
ple, and that parental home drinking environment affected adolescent drinking in the large
school sample. In the small school sample, we detect an interaction between the parental
home drinking environment and choosing friends that drink as they multiplicatively affect
friendship tie choice. Our findings suggest that future research should investigate the syner-
gistic effects of both peer and parental influences for adolescent friendship tie choices and
drinking behavior. And given the tendency of adolescents to form ties with their friends'
friends, and the evidence of local hierarchy in these networks, popular youth who do not
drink may be uniquely positioned and uniquely salient as the highest rank of the hierarchy to
cause anti-drinking peer influences to diffuse down the social hierarchy to less popular
youth. As such, future interventions should harness prosocial peer influences simultaneous-
ly with strategies to increase parental support and monitoring among parents to promote af-
filiation with prosocial peers.

Introduction
In the United States, the prevalence of adolescent drinking has declined since the late 1990s--
however the problem is far from being solved. Recent reports find that 71% of 9th- to 12th-
grade students indicate having had at least one drink of alcohol (other than a few sips) during
their lifetime, with about one fifth of them starting to drink by age 13 [1]. The high prevalence
of underage drinkers, and early initiation into drinking practices, has led to decades of research
on the consequences of adolescent alcohol use. Studies have linked adolescent drinking to
other adolescent problem behaviors, including automobile accidents [2,3,4,6], drug abuse
[3,4,8], engagement in risky sexual activities [2,3,4], school absenteeism [3,9], and poor or fail-
ing grades [3,4,5,7]. Thus, despite the declining rates of alcohol use among youth, adolescent
drinking remains a key agenda item for the public health community to address.
Ecological models [10,11] suggest that multiple contextual influences shape adolescent de-
velopment and health behavior. Adolescence is a critical time period during which various con-
textual influences--including those exerted by youths' friends and parents prominently as the
primary socialization forces--affecting adolescent development and their health behavior. The-
oretical intuition from ecological models suggests that both peer and parental influences might
act both independently and in synergy as they impact the simultaneous processes of adolescent
friendship tie choice and adolescent drinking.
Peer networks are a salient reference group for youth, with peers playing a particularly im-
portant and influential role in helping shape adolescents' evolving social worlds [12]. Various
characteristics of adolescent peer networks are salient for youths' friendship tie choices. Reci-
procity among adolescent friendship pairs is a strong force affecting friendship tie formation
among adolescent youth [13]. Indicators of degree, including in-degree centrality which is the
popularity of an actor in a network [14], and in-in degree assortativity, which is the tendency
to choose network actors who are similarly popular, are important for friendship tie selection,
as popular youth may have many options for forming friendships, and likewise may be more
likely to choose similarly popular friends. Another degree based network indicator, out-degree,
is an indicator of the number of ties a network actor sends [14], and reflects an actor's expan-
siveness in the network. Adolescents who send out more friendship tie nominations are salient
in a network. In addition, the number of transitive triplets and three-cycles, which reflect local
hierarchy in a network, are likely important for friendship tie choice as youth occupying posi-
tions in these triadic structures have an opportunity to influence one another, likely on multi-
ple dimensions including on friendship tie choices.
In addition to shaping adolescents' friendship tie choices, peer networks also shape adoles-
cent drinking behavior. Two important socialization processes operating in peer networks are
peer influence and peer selection. Peer influence is the process wherein youth alter their behav-
ior such that it aligns with that of their peers. Peer selection is the process by which youth select
friends who are similar to themselves, on various dimensions. Adolescent alcohol use can be
conceptualized as a result of both peer influence and selection processes, with friends influenc-
ing one another's drinking behavior and adolescents selecting friends who engage in similar
levels of drinking [15­20]. And in-degree popularity has also been positively related to adoles-
cent drinking behavior across studies [21­24].
Stochastic Actor-Based (SAB) models [25,26] have offered keen insights into adolescent al-
cohol use, allowing researchers to disentangle peer selection and peer influence effects. These
dynamic models estimate friendship tie choice and drinking behavior changes simultaneously.
One study found both selection (i.e., "birds of a feather" or homophily effects) and influence
(i.e., social contagion) effects for drinking behavior when using longitudinal data of youth in
the West of Scotland [27]. Similar studies based on longitudinal data collected in Netherlands

[28], Italy [29], Finland [30], and Sweden [31] also found both selection and influence processes
underlying adolescent drinking behavior similarity. The first study to utilize the SAB modeling
strategy to examine the drinking behavior among adolescents in the United States was Mundt,
Mercken, and Zakletskaia [32], using two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent to Adult Health (AddHealth), a nationally representative survey of US adoles-
cents from 7th to 12th grades between 1995 and 1996. Contrary to the findings from interna-
tional studies, Mundt, Mercken, and Zakletskaia [32] found only a significant selection effect
but no influence effect for alcohol use. A study utilizing data from 450 15-to-17 year-old stu-
dents attending a public high school in the Northeastern United States between 2004 and 2006
showed the opposite effect, with only a significant peer influence effect on alcohol use [33].
Moreover, a third study, using the PROSPER dataset--which followed 13,214 6th-to-9th grade
adolescents from 50 classrooms in Iowa and Pennsylvania during the fall of 2002 and 2003--
reported both significant influence and selection effects for drinking behavior similarity [34].
Parents are also influential referents in adolescents' social worlds, affecting both adolescent
friendship tie choices and their drinking behavior. Parents exert influences on the socialization
of adolescent youth through multiple processes, including the provision of social support and
parental monitoring. Indeed, parental influences have a critical impact on adolescent develop-
ment, particularly in the area of building youths' social competence regarding friendship for-
mation. One study indicated that familial factors are associated with social competence, peer
acceptance, and the ability to form and maintain close friendships among youth [35]. More-
over, theoretical guidance from Social Control Theory [36,37] casts parental monitoring as a
key process deterring youth from affiliating with delinquent peers, which may then act to lessen
the probability that youth begin using substances such as alcohol. As such, parents may affect
the likelihood that their adolescent children will select friends who drink. A recent cross-
sectional study examining adolescent substance use suggested that youth reared in families
characterized by a lack of familial obligations, emotional closeness, and support, were more
likely to affiliate with substance using peers, and that moreover, having these peer relationships
was associated with more substance use [38]. To the extent that parents are successful at moni-
toring their children, the adolescent child may have less opportunity to associate with friends
who drink, as parents may prohibit friendships with other youth who drink or prohibit their
adolescent children from being in situations which present opportunities to drink [39]. It is
therefore possible that parents' characteristics might interact with youths' friendship selection
as both factors may impact one another in relation to adolescent friendship networks.
Past studies also demonstrate that parental influences affect adolescent drinking behavior
directly. Previous research indicates that parental support prevents the early initiation of alco-
hol use and reduces the frequency of alcohol use among adolescents [40,41,42]. Moreover, pa-
rental monitoring and supervision have been negatively associated with adolescent alcohol use
[19,43]. Not all parental influences, however, are protective for alcohol use, as youth in homes
in which parents drink or parents display high levels of permissiveness for adolescent drinking
are more likely to increase their alcohol use levels over time [44,45,46].
It is possible that peer and parental influences may function together in impacting adoles-
cent friendship tie choices and drinking behavior, given insights from ecological models of de-
velopment suggesting that influences from these two contexts may act synergistically [10]. In a
study of 4,230 7th to 12th graders, parental drug (including binge drinking) attitudes had an in-
direct effect on the risk of adolescent drug use, which was mediated through peer drug use
[47]. In another study, Marshal and Chassin [48] found that parental support and discipline
buffered the effects of peer group affiliation on alcohol use of female adolescents. It may be that
parental attitudes and behavior relevant to monitoring, support, and parental drinking operate
synergistically with youths' affiliations with peers who use alcohol in affecting youths'

friendship tie choices. Having said that, extant studies have not systematically examined these
parental influences as they affect the co-evolving processes of friendship tie choice behavior
and alcohol use among adolescents, nor have they examined the interactions under study. As
such, whereas past studies have found a positive peer influence effect on adolescent alcohol use
[15­20], the current study goes a step further to examine whether youth whose parents engage
in close monitoring or provide strong emotional support, or have a home environment con-
doning drinking behavior, are more or less likely to adopt the drinking behavior of their friends
through a peer influence effect on their own drinking behavior. Secondly, the current study
also assesses whether parental support, parental monitoring, and the parental home drinking
environment interact with whether youth choose friends who drink as both factors might mul-
tiplicatively affect youths' friendship tie choice.
Finally, we also examine the effect of depressive symptoms among adolescents on their alco-
hol use. Adolescent drinking has been positively related to depression in previous studies
[23,49­53]. Depressive symptoms in adolescent youth have also been related to youths' friend-
ship tie choice behavior [54]. As such, we examine the role of depressive symptoms as they re-
late to adolescent drinking behavior.
The current study builds upon extant literature examining the importance of peer influence
and selection processes related to adolescent friendship tie choice and alcohol use. In addition,
we also focus on the role of key parental influences on adolescent friendship tie choice and al-
cohol use behavior. With data from the AddHealth study, we explore the co-evolution of ado-
lescents' friendship ties and their drinking behavior over two waves. We hypothesize that we
will observe both peer influence and peer selection effects, as adolescents will select friends
with similar alcohol use levels, and adjust their drinking behavior based on the drinking behav-
ior of their friends. We also expect that parental monitoring, parental support, and the parental
home drinking environment, will influence the friendship tie choice and adolescent drinking,
both directly and synergistically.
Data and Methods
Data
The data utilized in this study come from early waves of AddHealth. The respondent record/
information was anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. This study has been approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Irvine (2013). This study
does not employ human subjects directly, as our analyses utilize secondary data which are de-
identified. AddHealth participants provided written informed consent for participation in all
aspects of AddHealth in accordance with the University of North Carolina School of Public
Health Institutional Review Board guidelines that are based on the Code of Federal Regulations
on the Protection of Human Subjects 45CFR46: http://www.hhs.
gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html. Written informed consent was given by par-
ticipants (or next of kin/caregiver) for their answers to be used in this study.
AddHealth is a longitudinal study of a stratified sample of US schools from 7th to 12th grades
[55]. The AddHealth data is one of the richest adolescent network data sources collected to date
in the United States. The network boundary is defined by a meaningful social and policy-relevant
unit, the school, with information on basic demographics (i.e., gender, race, age), attitudes and
behaviors, and ecological structures (i.e., family, school, neighborhood), as well as on all friend-
ship relations. Thus these data are ideal for examining the co-evolution of friendship networks
and drinking behavior in school based contexts. Although the AddHealth data were collected
nearly 20 years ago, these data continue to be relevant to the mechanisms of in-school friendship
formation, and continue to be widely used in current public health studies [32,56­62].

AddHealth contains a saturated sample of 16 schools out of the total 132 participant schools
[55]. Among the 16 schools, there is a special education school with constant student turnover,
and another school with an administrative error in which the students' IDs at the earlier wave
could not be matched with those at later waves. Thus these two schools are not suitable for longi-
tudinal network analysis. Of the remaining 14 schools, two are large schools (over 1,000 students
enrolled) often called "Jefferson High" and "Sunshine High" [56,63] whose macro settings were
quite different from the other 12 small schools with fewer than 200 students enrolled [64,65].
(Among the twelve small schools, network size, or number of respondents, is between 30 and 197.
The mean is 107 and SD is 53.46.) Given computational power issues, we could not estimate the
model for the biggest school, "Sunshine High." Since our analysis requires longitudinal measures
of friendship networks, we focus on two samples: 1) a saturated sampling of 1,284 students from
12 small schools, and 2) that of 976 students from the second biggest school, "Jefferson High" [63].
During the administration of the AddHealth survey, all students in 14 schools were invited
to take the survey over three waves. Information on the social and demographic characteristics
of the respondents was collected, as well as their risk behaviors including alcohol use. Adoles-
cent sociometric networks were constructed from a network elicitation item asking respon-
dents to name up to five male and five female best friends from a name list of students in
his/her school, and thus researchers are able to attain longitudinal complete sociometric net-
works in these schools. The measures of youths' parental contexts came from a parent survey
between April and December of 1995, the same time when the respondents also took a wave 1
In-Home Survey. However, due to another administrative error, about 37% respondents in the
12 small schools and about 5% respondents in "Jefferson High" were recorded to nominate
only one (instead of five) female and male best friends. To overcome this limited nomination
difficulty, in this study we utilize the information retrieved from the first (In-School Survey
during 1994 and 1995) and third (wave 2 In-Home Survey between April and December of
1996) time points for our dynamic network analysis, skipping that from the second time point
(wave 1 In-Home Survey).
Measures
The dependent (behavior) variable measures drinking frequency in the past 12 months. At
wave 1, the survey question was "During the past twelve months, how often did you drink beer,
wine, or liquor?" with response categories of "0--never", "1­1 once or twice", "2­2 once a
month or less", "3­2 or 3 days a month", "4--once or twice a week", "5­3 to 5 days a week", and
"6--nearly every day." In waves 2 and 3, the survey question was "During the past 12 months,
on how many days did you drink alcohol?" with response categories of "1--every day or almost
every day", "2­3 to 5 days a week", "3­1 or 2 days a week", "4­2 or 3 days a month", "5--once a
month or less (3­12 times in the past 12 months)", "6­1 or 2 days in the past 12 months", and
"7--never". We recoded these such that response categories specify non-drinkers (0 = never),
casual-drinkers (1 = 1 or 2 days), light-drinkers (2 = once a month or less or 3­12 times in the
past 12 months), medium-drinkers (3 = 2 or 3 days a month), and heavy-drinkers (4 = more
than 1 or 2 days a week). (We do not have a measure of drinking intensity. The only related
question asked over all three time points was "During the past twelve months, how often did
you get drunk?" However, students may interpret the number of drinks required to be "drunk"
very differently, and we therefore do not include this measure.)
Predictors of drinking behavior include gender (0 = male, 1 = female), grade (7~12), depres-
sive symptoms, parental support, parental monitoring, and the parental home drinking environ-
ment. Depressive symptom status is generated as a factor score of 19 ordinal items modified
from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Cronbach's  = 0.87) [66].

Parental support and parental monitoring are computed as standardized factor scores
(means = 0, standard deviations = 1) through confirmatory factor analysis, with Root Mean
Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) about. 05 and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) greater
than. 95, which both suggest a good fit. Items indicating parental support include whether the
student had talked about a personal problem with their parents (0 = no, 1 = yes), whether the
parents and the student communicated well, whether the parents were warm and loving, wheth-
er the student reported a "good relationship" with parents (same response categories for three
items above: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = agree,
5 = strongly agree), the student's closeness to their parents, and how much the student felt his or
her parents cared about him or her (same response categories for two items above: 1 = not at all,
2 = very little, 3 = somewhat, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = very much). Items indicating parental monitor-
ing include whether parents let the student make decisions about a weekend curfew, the people
the student hung around with, how much television the student watched, which television pro-
gram the student watched, and what the week night bedtime was (0 = yes, 1 = no), and the pres-
ence of parents when the student was back from school (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = some
of the time, 3 = most of the time, 4 = always, 5 = they brought the student home from school),
eating dinner (0~7 days per week), and going to bed (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = some of
the time, 3 = most of the time, 4 = always). Home drinking environment is measured by sum-
ming up two binary measures (0 = no, 1 = yes): parental drinking was coded as "yes" if the par-
ent reported that they drank at least once a month, and alcohol availability was coded as "yes" if
the adolescent respondents reported positively that "alcohol is easily available at home".
Plan of Analysis
To explore the co-evolution of friendship networks and drinking behavior in continuous Mar-
kov time, we utilize the SAB model with the R-based Simulation Investigation for Empirical
Network Analysis (RSiena) package [67]. The SAB model assumes that a respondent will make
decisions that optimize his or her network and behavior status in the next time step based on
his or her current state of network-behavioral configuration, which is referred to as the objec-
tive function. The objective function is defined as f(,x) = Sk
k
Sik
(x), where k
is the kth esti-
mated parameter for the actor-specific effect sik
(x) and x is the joint network-behavioral state.
Positive values of the objective function indicate the preferred direction of changes, while nega-
tive values suggest the avoidance of such changes. In RSiena, the objective function of network
changes and behavior changes are estimated simultaneously to generate both a network and a
behavioral equation. Together, these constitute a set of interdependent equations with the rate
functions i
(,x), which indicate the expected frequency of changes in the networks or behav-
ior the actors make between observation points. The model is then estimated by simulating the
networks and behavior forward in time. Thus, there are many micro-steps in the model in
which actors update their objective functions regarding alcohol use behavior and network tie
choice. A Method of moments (MoM) estimation is used to estimate the network and behavior
parameters such that the main characteristics of the networks and behaviors are most
closely approximated.
As shown in Table 1, in the network equation predicting friendship tie choice, we include
several structural network effects, i.e., out-degree and reciprocity capturing tie preference, tran-
sitive triplets and three cycles measuring triadic closure, and in-degree popularity and in-in de-
gree assortativity (square root) differentiating the tendency towards preferential attachment vs.
degree assortativity [68,69]. The network equation (friendship tie choice) also controls for sim-
ilarity measures, including similarity on gender, grade, and parent education level (as a proxy
of family socio-economic status). The function of parental influences on friendship tie choice is

tested by the inclusion of respondents' parental support, parental monitoring, and their paren-
tal home drinking environment. For the behavior variable alcohol use (z), we specify it as a
main effect on alter attractiveness (drinking alter), as a main effect on network activity of ego
(drinking ego), and as a similarity (homophily) effect.
As shown in Table 2, in the drinking behavior equation, the linear and quadratic shape pa-
rameters model the long-term trend in alcohol use. The in-degree item measures whether ado-
lescents receiving more in-coming ties (more popular) drank more over time. We measure the
peer influence effect as the sum of negative absolute difference between ego's and alters' behav-
ior averaged by ego's out-degree. Additional covariates such as gender, grade, and depressive
symptoms are controlled to test how the parental factors--i.e., parental home drinking envi-
ronment, parental support, and parental monitoring--affected adolescent drinking in Model 1.
Whereas Model 1 includes all the measures described (the "main effects" model), Models 2
through 4 assess the moderating role of an adolescent's parental factors. Thus, we included

interaction variables of selecting a friend who drank (drinking alter) with parental support, pa-
rental monitoring, and the parental home drinking environment in Models 2, 3, and 4, respec-
tively. Likewise, in these same models we included interaction terms of friends' influence effect
(peer influence) with parental support, parental monitoring, and the parental home drinking
environment in Models 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
It should be noted that when the interaction between parental support and friends' influence
was added to the behavior equation of Model 2 for the 12 small schools, many of the effects
were dramatically inconsistent with that in Model 1, 3, and 4: both their parameters and stan-
dard errors appear to be magnified (as shown in the shaded area of S1 Table). A further exami-
nation of the correlations among the parameters suggests collinearity issues due to this specific
interaction effect. We therefore removed this interaction from the behavior equation of Model
2 for the 12 small schools. We have also tried estimating a Model 5 for each sample, with all po-
tential moderators included in the same SAB model. However, due to the high collinearity
among these interaction effects, the model cannot reach convergence.
There are various approaches to combining multiple networks, including a meta-analysis ap-
proach and combining different sub-projects into one multi-group project with rate parameters al-
lowed to differ across sub-projects. In this study we followed Cheadle and Goosby [64] and
Cheadle and Schwadel [65] to explore the general tendency of the network and behavior dynamics
in the 12 small schools by combining their friendship networks into one large network and using
structural zeroes to indicate that ties between the schools are not permitted (see [67], page 81).
Although we aimed to explore the general tendency of network and behavior dynamics in
the 12 small schools, we also considered possible variations across schools along several key di-
mensions: (1) urban, suburban vs. rural, (2) public vs. private, (3) single race vs. multiple race,
and (4) different response rates. For the first three dimensions, we estimated ancillary models
including interactions between dummy variables for these contextual variables and key drink-
ing effects. They were insignificant, suggesting that co-evolution of friendship tie choice and
drinking behavior was similar across different types of schools (e.g., see S2 Table along with S1
File). Among the 12 small schools, 10 had response rates above 70% and 2 had response rates
between 55%~70%. To account for the influence from response rate, we ran ancillary models
with friendship networks of the 10 small schools combined into one large network and com-
pared the results with those from the 12 small schools. The parameters were quite similar in
these separate models. These results are available from the authors upon request.
In this way we can list the results of the 12 small schools and "Jefferson High" side by side to
observe their similarities and differences. Respondents showing up at either an early or later
observation point are included in the analysis. They were also allowed to join or leave their net-
works (e.g., graduates, movers, dropouts), with structural zeroes indicating they were no longer
there at this time point (see [67,70]). Missing data are handled by RSiena software and imputed
within the models as Huisman and Steglich [71], and Ripley, Snijders, Boda, Vörös, and Pre-
ciado [67] suggested. We assessed the goodness-of-fit of the models by comparing network sta-
tistics and drinking distribution of 1,000 simulations based on our model to the observed
network and the fit was quite good (e.g., see S1 and S2 Figs. along with S2 File).

The alcohol use and network descriptive statistics of the 12 small schools and "Jefferson High"
are summarized in Table 3. (The distribution of drinking behavior in each of 12 small schools
is shown in S3 Table.) Among the small school sample, 52% students reported they were non-
drinkers during the In-School Survey, and this proportion increased to 61.1% during the wave

months), medium- (3 = 2 or 3 days a month), and heavy-drinkers (4 = more than 1 or 2 days a
week), drinking was a far more prevalent behavior in this school than in small schools. The
group size of casual-drinkers (1 = 1 or 2 days) decreased in both samples, and their members
either became non-drinkers, or chose to increase their drinking frequency to other levels.
Among the 1,284 respondents in the 12 small schools, the number of out-going ties de-
creased from 6,671 during the In-School Survey to 2,704 during the wave 2 In-Home Survey
due to graduation, moving, dropping out, and attrition/non-response/missing network data.
A similar pattern was also observed in "Jefferson High". The proportional change of reciprocal
ties was more variable in the small schools (from 0.45 to 0.33). The transitivity index, which
captures the tendency for individuals to experience triadic closure, was found to be relatively
stable over time, although stronger in small schools (34%) compared to "Jefferson High"
(18~20%). As indicated by the Jaccard index, there was a high turnover of friendship ties in
both samples, with only 21~22% of ties persisting over the two waves.
The descriptive statistics of covariates are reported in Table 4.
Network Evolution: Friendship Tie Choice
As shown in the network equation of Model 1 in Table 5 and Table 6, we observe significantly
positive parameters for drinking similarity in both samples, although the estimated parameter
is about 135% larger in the 12 small schools (b = .33, p <. 01) than in "Jefferson High" (b = .14,
p <. 05). These provide evidence of a peer selection effect, as students were more likely to select
as friends others with similar levels of alcohol use.
In both samples we also find that those drinking more frequently were more popular than
those drinking less frequently, although they seemed to be even appealing in small schools
(b = .28, p <. 05) compared to "Jefferson High" (b = .11, p <. 01). Adolescents having higher
drinking levels were inclined to nominate fewer best friends that those with lower drinking lev-
els, but this effect is only significant in "Jefferson High" (b = -.08, p <. 05).

In terms of structural network effects, the significantly negative out-degree (b = -2.09,
p <. 001 in small schools and b = -2.51, p <. 001 in "Jefferson High") and the significantly posi-
tive reciprocity parameters (b = 1.79, p <. 001 in small schools and b = 2.73, p <. 001 in "Jeffer-
son High") suggest that adolescents in both samples tended to form fewer ties, but when they
did such ties were more likely to be reciprocal ones. The adolescents also preferred to be friends
with their friends' friends (triadic closure), as indicated by the positive transitive triplets effect
(b = .23, p <. 001 in small schools and b = .51, p <. 001 in "Jefferson High"). The significantly
negative three-cycle effect implies a tendency toward local hierarchy (b = -.14, p <. 01 in small
schools and b = -.43, p <. 001 in "Jefferson High"). Adolescents were more likely to be named
as a tie if they already had many in-coming ties (high in-degree popularity) (b = .07, p <. 001
in small schools and b = .04, p <. 05 in "Jefferson High"). And the negative parameter for in-in
degree assortativity (square root) again suggests the presence of preferential attachment as ado-
lescents with high in-degree were more likely to be nominated as best friends by those with low
in-degree, but this effect is only significant in the small school sample (b = -.07, p <. 01).
We find that homophily preferences in gender and grade drove friendship tie formation: ad-
olescents were more likely to send friendship nominations to other adolescents with the same
gender (b = .20, p <. 001 in small schools and b = .27, p <. 001 in "Jefferson High") and in the
same grade (b = .45, p <. 001 in small schools and b = .41, p <. 001 in "Jefferson High"). The
homophily effects of parental educational levels are insignificant in both samples, after control-
ling for the other measures in the model.
As for how the parental influences affected friendship tie choice, we find that adolescents
who received more parental support nominate more friends in the 12 small schools (b = .35,
p <. 001). This effect for parental support was insignificant in "Jefferson High". And we find
that more parental monitoring and a home drinking environment did not affect tie choice.
When focusing on the moderating effect of family contexts on friendship tie choice in Mod-
els 2 to 4 of Tables 5 and 6, although the signs of interaction parameters are as expected, the
only statistically significant effect is that between the parental home drinking environment and
drinking alter in the small school sample (b = .18, p <. 05): whereas higher-level drinkers were

tended to drink less over time, but there was also a self-reinforcement effect of alcohol use:
there appeared to be a tendency towards polarization on both ends of drinking behavior, as ad-
olescents were inclined to either become or remain a non-drinker or escalate to heavy use.
Popular adolescents (with higher values of in-degree) were not found to drink more frequently
in either case. Additional significant effects were found for grade in small schools (b = .03,
p <. 05) and gender in "Jefferson High" (b = -.09, p <. 01): higher-grade adolescents in the 12
small schools and males in "Jefferson High" were generally found to increase their drinking fre-
quency over time more than their counterparts.
Regarding the parental influences, we find that adolescents who experienced more drinking
at home were more likely to increase their own drinking frequency (b = .10, p <. 001 in small
schools and b = .06, p <. 05 in "Jefferson High"). Adolescents with higher levels of parental
monitoring engaged in less drinking behavior over time, but this effect is only significant in
small school sample (b = -.39, p <. 05). The parental support respondents received had a nega-
tive effect on the frequency of adolescent drinking, although not significant in either case.
Turning to the interaction effects included in Model 2 to Model 4 of Table 5 and Table 6,
there was no evidence that parental support, parental monitoring, or the parental home drink-
ing environment moderated the peer influence effect in either sample.
Discussion
This study aimed to disentangle peer selection and peer influence processes and other key net-
work effects simultaneously with salient parental influences by examining the co-evolution of
friendship tie choices and drinking behavior among adolescents in two AddHealth samples. Be-
cause the network size and drinking prevalence were relatively different in the two samples--
e.g., Jefferson High was a much larger school with intensive adolescent alcohol use--one might
presume that the co-evolution mechanisms of friendship tie choices and drinking behavior
would differ. Our models demonstrate that to the contrary, the evidence across the two samples
was typically quite similar. In the friendship tie choice equation, most measures had effects sim-
ilar in direction and statistical significance. The differences were mostly in magnitude of the ef-
fects: in the friendship tie choice equation, whereas the network structural effects such as
reciprocity, transitive triplets, and three-cycles were larger in "Jefferson High", the popularity of
heavier drinkers and the selection effect of choosing ties based on similarity of drinking behav-
ior were smaller in "Jefferson High". The effect of peer influence was stronger in "Jefferson

High" with more drinking behavior, implying that such a context may be particularly important
for transmitting norms about drinking behavior among adolescents. The most notable differ-
ences were that in small schools with lower levels of alcohol use, parental support had a much
stronger effect on friendship tie choice, the parental home drinking environment had a much
stronger effect on forming ties with those who drink more, and parental monitoring appeared
more effective in reducing drinking behavior.
Our findings demonstrate that peer selection played a significant role in facilitating drinking
behavior similarity in the adolescents' friendship networks. Adolescents preferred to form
friendships with those who displayed similar levels of alcohol use. These results support previ-
ous findings regarding the importance of peer selection in accounting for behavioral similari-
ties across dyads in friendship networks [32,34]. At the same time, our findings also indicate
the important role of peer influence in friendship networks, as do previous studies [33,34],
demonstrating the importance of peer influence in adolescent networks. Overall, our findings
suggest that both peer and parental factors were instrumental in shaping both friendship tie
choice and drinking behavior.
Regarding our findings pertaining to friendship tie choice, we observe that heavy-drinkers re-
ceived more in-coming ties and hence were more popular. Also using data from the AddHealth
In-School survey, Balsa, Homer, French, and Norton [21] found that popularity (also measured
as ego's in-degree) was positively associated with drinking frequency. However, they acknowl-
edged that their cross-sectional design prevented them from assessing the causal ordering or the
extent that a reciprocated relationship existed between these two measures [21]. Our findings
suggest a unilateral relationship between alcohol use and network popularity: whereas alcohol
use increased popularity, more popular adolescents did not drink more over time.
Our findings also suggest that while adolescents' peer relationships were central to their
lives, parents still had influence on both adolescent alcohol use and friendship tie choice. First,
in line with previous studies [44,45,46], adolescents were more likely to engage in underage
drinking if the parents provided a favorable environment for adolescent alcohol use. In our
study, these respondents in such family environments were not only particularly likely to form
friendship ties with adolescents with high drinking levels, but our model implies that through
peer influence they would over time engage in higher levels of alcohol use.
We also observed a negative relationship between parental monitoring and drinking in the
small school sample. Our finding is consistent with prior studies indicating a negative relation-
ship between parental monitoring and adolescent drinking behavior [19,43]. That parental
monitoring is risk protective for substance use has been shown in these studies, which highlight
the continuing role of parents in enforcing rules and discipline during the high school years
helped reduce the alcohol use level among adolescents, at least in the small school sample.
Our findings also indicated a negative relationship between parental support and alcohol use.
This finding is consistent with past studies indicating a negative relationship between parental
support and drinking behavior [40,41,42]. It is likely that the provision of parental support ren-
ders adolescents more able to develop social competencies necessary to form friendship ties.
Our findings differ from a previous study using Add Health [32] that did not find a signifi-
cant influence effect. There are several reasons for these different results. First, there is different
sample selection, as our study utilizes data from the In-School Survey and the wave 2 In-Home
survey, but not data from the wave 1 In-Home Survey to avoid difficulty due to limited nomi-
nations, whereas Mundt and colleagues [32] selected respondents from the wave 1 In-Home
survey and the wave 2 In-Home Survey. Second, our study includes respondents present in ei-
ther wave, whereas Mundt and colleagues [32] only included those who completed the survey
at the first time point (assuming those not completing the survey are not part of the network).
Third, our study integrates parental factors into the friendship tie choice and drinking
Alcohol Use among Adolescent Youth

equations, which had important effects in the models. Fourth, we utilized a different strategy
for handling multiple networks, as we combined the friendship networks of the 12 small
schools into one large network, whereas Mundt and colleagues [32] employed a meta-analysis.
Finally, we utilized a different peer influence specification. Each of these factors likely contrib-
utes to the differences in results across these two studies.
Our study has several limitations. First, all the analyses are based on self-reported data from
AddHealth. One consequence of using self-reports of illicit substance use is underreporting.
Some studies find that adolescent reporting is better than parent, peer, or other reporting [72].
Still, future studies may benefit by using multiple measures of alcohol use (e.g. employing phys-
iological or biological indicators of alcohol use) to ensure high internal validity [73]. Second,
the friendship networks were retrieved through a name generator limited to a maximum of five
male and five female best friends and thus were not a fully accurate portrayal of a respondent's
peer network. It is unclear how our findings would have differed had the adolescents sampled
been allowed to nominate all of their friends. Third, the AddHealth data did not include infor-
mation on alcohol use behavior of other family members, i.e., respondents' brothers and sisters.
It would be much better for future studies to account for various levels of familial influences.
Despite these limitations, our findings have implications for future studies. Our findings
suggest merit in further examination of the role of the parental influences under study as they
affect co-evolution of friendship networks and drinking behavior among US adolescents, as
well as the mechanisms underlying the relationship between alcohol use and network populari-
ty. Given that those in a home environment which favored drinking were particularly likely to
form friendship ties with higher-drinking-level adolescents suggests a need to study this possi-
bility more closely.
Our findings also have practical implications for health behavior change interventions tar-
geting adolescent alcohol use. Motivated by intuition from intervention studies applying con-
cepts from the opinion leader literature [74,75] employing the general strategy of identifying
popular youth as means to transmit prosocial peer influences through a network system, we
suggest that one way to promote positive peer influences against drinking and to likewise
dampen the influence of drinkers in peer networks is to target popular youth who do not drink
and are connected through transitive triplets. Given the hierarchical structuring of our data (as
indicated by the significantly positive transitive triplet and significantly negative three cycle ef-
fect), popular youth are uniquely positioned, and as well uniquely salient in the highest rank of
the hierarchy. Peer influences exerted by popular youth will likely diffuse down the social hier-
archy to less popular youth. In addition, given the salience of reciprocated ties among adoles-
cent youth, another intervention strategy would target mutually reciprocated friendship pairs
of youth (i.e., drinking pairs, non-drinking pairs, and mixed drinking status pairs) to promote
anti-drinking peer influences, social support, and resistance training skills to influence one an-
other to stop drinking or not begin drinking. Lastly, parents should be targeted to both increase
their capacity to provide support to and monitoring of their adolescent children, in order to
help their children foster friendships with prosocial peers who are not substance users.
Conclusion
In sum, this study examined the co-evolution of friendship networks and drinking behavior
among two representative samples of US adolescents. Adolescents with similar alcohol use lev-
els were more likely to form friendships than their peers with more dissimilar alcohol use lev-
els, and adolescents also adjusted their drinking behavior to match that of their best friends.
Moreover, we found that those who drank more were more popular, but popular adolescents
did not drink more over time. Our findings also indicate that the parental home drinking

environment had a positive effect on adolescent drinking over time. Overall, our findings sug-
gest in the importance of disentangling the effects of friendship networks and family contexts
when trying to understand the co-evolution of adolescent friendship tie choice and alcohol use.
Future studies should further explore the risk and protective aspects of these peer and parental
environments for adolescent alcohol use.
