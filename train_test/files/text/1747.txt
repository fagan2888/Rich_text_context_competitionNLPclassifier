Residential self-selection bias in the estimation of
built environment effects on physical activity
between adolescence and young adulthood
Janne Boone-Heinonen1, David K Guilkey2, Kelly R Evenson3, Penny Gordon-Larsen1*
Abstract
Background: Built environment research is dominated by cross-sectional designs, which are particularly vulnerable
to residential self-selection bias resulting from health-related attitudes, neighborhood preferences, or other
unmeasured characteristics related to both neighborhood choice and health-related outcomes.
Methods: We used cohort data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (United States; Wave I,
1994-95; Wave III, 2001-02; n = 12,701) and a time-varying geographic information system. Longitudinal
relationships between moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) bouts and built and socioeconomic
environment measures (landcover diversity, pay and public physical activity facilities per 10,000 population, street
connectivity, median household income, and crime rate) from adolescence to young adulthood were estimated
using random effects models (biased by unmeasured confounders) and fixed effects models (within-person
estimator, which adjusts for unmeasured confounders that are stable over time).
Results: Random effects models yielded null associations except for negative crime-MVPA associations [coefficient
(95% CI): -0.056 (-0.083, -0.029) in males, -0.061 (-0.090, -0.033) in females]. After controlling for measured and time
invariant unmeasured characteristics using within-person estimators, MVPA was higher with greater physical activity
pay facilities in males [coefficient (95% CI): 0.024 (0.006, 0.042)], and lower with higher crime rates in males
[coefficient (95% CI): -0.107 (-0.140, -0.075)] and females [coefficient (95% CI): -0.046 (-0.083, -0.009)]. Other
associations were null or in the counter-intuitive direction.
Conclusions: Comparison of within-person estimates to estimates unadjusted for unmeasured characteristics
suggest that residential self-selection can bias associations toward the null, as opposed to its typical
characterization as a positive confounder. Differential environment-MVPA associations by residential relocation
suggest that studies examining changes following residential relocation may be vulnerable to selection bias. The
authors discuss complexities of adjusting for residential self-selection and residential relocation, particularly during
the adolescent to young adult transition.
Background
Built environment characteristics such as walkability
[1,2] and availability of recreation centers [3,4] are asso-
ciated with physical activity (PA) in a growing literature.
However, existing research is dominated by cross-sec-
tional studies, which are particularly vulnerable to resi-
dential self-selection bias resulting from unmeasured
neighborhood selection factors related to built environ-
ment exposures and PA [5,6]. Neighborhood selection
factors may include preference for PA resources, which
could affect neighborhood choice and PA level. Simi-
larly, social and financial resources not only influence
where individuals can afford to live but also shape per-
ceived barriers to PA. Furthermore, traditional covariate
adjustment cannot adequately control for neighborhood
preferences and other residential selection factors that
are difficult or impossible to measure.
Longitudinal designs can address residential self-selec-
tion bias by establishing temporality and controlling for

unmeasured characteristics. In two key longitudinal stu-
dies [7,8], investigators used "first difference" models to
estimate the influence of urban form on travel behavior
or obesity. First difference models and a similar method,
"fixed effects" models, use within-person estimators to
control for unmeasured characteristics that remain con-
stant throughout the study period [6,9] (e.g., genetics or
resilient attitudes toward exercise) by analyzing variation
in the exposure and outcome within person, over time.
Within-person estimation is especially valuable when
confounders are difficult to measure (e.g., residential
selection factors), and is most appropriate for exposure-
outcome relationships with short lag times [10] (e.g.,
theorized built environment influences on PA). Recent
longitudinal studies [11-14] investigating built environ-
ment effects on PA do not use within-person estimation
to control for unmeasured characteristics.
Furthermore, the few relevant existing studies which
use within-person estimation [2,7,8,15] examine changes
in behavior or body weight related to changes in urban
form resulting from residential relocation. However, the
environment can change around stationary residents.
Furthermore, residential relocation is often triggered by
events such as marriage or employment changes [16],
which may also influence health-related behaviors.
Therefore, restricting to those who move residences
may induce selection bias [17].
Our primary objective was to estimate within-person
effects of time-varying, objectively measured built and
socioeconomic environment characteristics on moderate
to vigorous PA (MVPA) in a nationally representative
sample. Secondary objectives were to (a) assess the
influence of time invariant, unmeasured characteristics
on environment-PA associations by comparing within-
person estimates to naïve estimates which do not
address unmeasured characteristics, and (b) explore
selectivity related to residential relocation. This paper
reports the results of these objectives, followed by a dis-
cussion of the complexities of adjusting for residential
self-selection and residential relocation, particularly dur-
ing the adolescent to young adult transition.
Methods
Study population and data sources
We used Wave I (1994-95) and III (2001-02) data from
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health), a cohort study of 20,745 adolescents
representative of the U.S. school-based population in
grades 7 to 12 (11-22 years of age) in 1994-95 followed
into adulthood (18-26 years at Wave III). Add Health
included a core sample plus subsamples of selected min-
ority and other groupings collected under protocols
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The survey
design and sampling frame have been discussed else-
where [18].
Using a geographic information system (GIS), we
linked respondents' Wave I and III residential locations
to community-level data theorized to influence obesity
and obesity-related behaviors. Among respondents in
the probability sample (nWave I
= 18,924, nWave III
=
14,322), residential locations were determined from geo-
coded home addresses with street-segment matches
(nWave I
= 15,480, nWave III
= 12,263), global positioning
system (GPS) measurements (nWave I
= 2,966, nWave III
=
1,148), ZIP/ZIP+4/ZIP+2 centroid match (nWave I
= 205,
nWave III
= 647) and geocoded school location (nWave I
=
243; not applicable in Wave III, n = 264 unmatched).
Comparison of individual-level and environmental mea-
sures across location sources suggest that respondent
locations identified with GPS or ZIP codes (compared
to geocoded addresses) were located in rural areas. Such
differences were expected because rural residents more
often use Post Office Boxes or other addresses that can-
not be geocoded; that is, multiple location sources
allowed us to include such respondents, thereby mini-
mizing selection bias. Residential locations were linked
to attributes of circular areas of various radii surround-
ing each wave-specific respondent residence (Euclidean
neighborhood buffer) and block group, tract, and county
attributes from time-matched U.S. Census and other
data (see Study variables, below), which were merged
with individual-level Add Health interview responses.
Of 18,924 Wave I respondents in the probability sam-
ple, 6% refused participation and 19% could not be
located or were unable to participate for other reasons,
leaving 14,322 Wave III respondents. Exclusions
included mobility disability (n = 87) or self-reported
pregnancy at Wave I or III (n = 578) and Native Ameri-
cans due to small sample size (n = 121). Of the remain-
ing sample (n = 13,546), those missing individual-level
variables (n = 266), environmental variables (n = 568),
or both (n = 11) were excluded. Those excluded due to
missing data (n = 845) were generally similar to the ana-
lytical sample (n = 12,701) with regard to Wave I and
III individual sociodemographics, MVPA, and environ-
mental variables. Exceptions included lower census
tract-level median income and Wave III landscape diver-
sity, and higher Wave III MVPA in excluded respon-
dents (data not shown).
Study variables
GIS-derived environmental characteristics
Geographic Units We used neighborhood buffer sizes
(e.g., 1 or 3 k) based on research showing that MVPA
was most strongly and consistently associated with
street connectivity within smaller areas (1 k) and with
PA facilities within larger areas (3 k) [19], consistent

with theorized higher incentive to travel to PA facilities
and engagement in street-based activities closer to
home. We selected census tracts for census variables
based on similar sensitivity analysis (unpublished data),
while crime data were available only at the county level.
Built and socioeconomic environment measures We
selected built and socioeconomic environment measures
shown to adequately represent multidimensional envir-
onmental constructs [20]. Table 1 presents variable
descriptions, data sources, and geographic unit. Briefly,
pay and public PA facilities counts were obtained
from Dun and Bradstreet, a dataset of U.S. businesses
validated against a field-based census [21]. We then cal-
culated PA facility availability (counts per 10,000 popu-
lation). In contrast with raw counts or distance to
facilities, such population-scaled measures may help to
separate availability of facilities from density of develop-
ment, which are independently related to behavior
[20,22].
Simpson's Diversity Index, an indicator of landscape
diversity and complexity [23], was calculated using
Fragstats software [24]. Alpha index indicated the
degree of street connectivity [25], which provides
numerous, often more direct route options [26]. Socioe-
conomic environment measures included census tract-
level median household income and county-level non-
violent and violent crime rate per 100,000 population.
To account for slight inaccuracies in geocoded loca-
tions and inconsequential moves, residential relocation
(mover vs. non-movers) was defined as > 1/4 mile Eucli-
dean distance between Wave I and III residential
locations.
Individual-level variables
Weekly frequency (bouts) of leisure-time MVPA (skating
& cycling, exercise, and active sports) was ascertained at
Waves I and III using a standard, interview administered
activity recall based on questionnaires validated in other
epidemiologic studies [27,28]. The questionnaire included
activities relevant to adolescents (11-22 years) at Wave
I and was modified at Wave III (18-26 years) to include
age-appropriate activities, so Wave III bouts were scaled
for comparability with Wave I [29]. Semi-continuous
MVPA was rounded to the nearest integer for appropriate
modeling as a count variable.
Individual-level sociodemographic control variables
included Wave I self-identified race (white, black, Asian,
Hispanic), parent-reported annual household income
and highest education attained (< high school, high
school or GED, some college,  college degree), and age
at Wave I and III interviews. To account for regional

differences in MVPA and neighborhood environments,
we controlled for administratively determined U.S.
region (West, Midwest, South, Northeast). Socioeco-
nomic position in young adulthood involves a complex
array of behaviors and achievements [30,31] which are
potential predictors of residential relocation, so we used
parent income and education to indicate socioeconomic
position in both waves.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis
Individual-level and environment variables were com-
pared by residential relocation status using adjusted
Wald tests and design-based F-tests (95% confidence
level) for continuous and categorical variables, respec-
tively. Analyses were weighted for national representa-
tion and corrected for complex survey design using
Stata 10.1 survey commands. To address skewness, we
report median and interquartile range and performed
statistical tests on natural-log transformed pay and pub-
lic facility availability and median household income.
Regression analysis
Within-person effects of environment measures on
MVPA bouts from adolescence (Wave I) to young adult-
hood (Wave III) were estimated using fixed effects Pois-
son regression (Objective 1). Fixed effects (versus first
differences) accommodate our nonlinear dependent vari-
able. By analyzing deviations of the outcome and expo-
sures from person-specific means, fixed effects models
remove person-specific error and are therefore not
biased by time invariant unmeasured characteristics. As
demonstrated elsewhere [6,8,32] and in additional file 1,
appendix A, interpretation of the coefficients is
unchanged from traditional regression models. In con-
trast, "random effects" estimates incorporate both
between- and within-person variation and thus do not
control for unmeasured characteristics that vary or
remain constant over time (naïve estimation; Objective
2a) [33].
The Hausman specification test formally compared
fixed and random effects estimates. All models were fit
using the Stata 10.1 xtpoisson function [34], which pro-
vided comparable estimates but does not accommodate
probability weights. Sample weighted, school cluster-cor-
rected, within-person estimates obtained using an alter-
native method [32] were substantively similar, but
comparable random effects estimates were not possible
given the available software. Random effects models cor-
rected for school-level clustering by including school
indicator variables [35]; higher-level clustering is sub-
sumed into between-person variation which does not
influence fixed effects regression models.
The MVPA distribution was overdispersed (the stan-
dard deviation was larger than assumed by the Poisson
distribution), but the conditional likelihood for the nega-
tive binomial distribution required for fixed effects mod-
els is problematic [32]. However, additional error terms
in random and fixed effects models [36] and correction
for school-level variation may help to address overdis-
persion by allowing for sources of variability not
included in a standard Poisson model. Estimates from
cross-sectional Poisson and negative binomial models
are virtually identical.
Buffer-based environment measures were individual-
level variables. While census tracts or counties could
comprise a third level in multilevel analysis, they are not
nested within schools, our primary sampling unit and
more important source of clustering. Additionally, our
data were sparse (average 8 and 2.3 respondents per
census tract in Wave I and III, respectively) and unba-
lanced (1-275 and 1-95 respondents per census tract in
Wave I and III, respectively), so multilevel analysis may
have produced biased estimates [37]. Intraclass correla-
tions for ln(MVPA) were minimal (0.03 in both Waves;
ICC's are not definable for Poisson distributed
outcomes).
Natural log transformations of environment measures
linearized relationships with MVPA bouts in preliminary
analysis. Because both the dependent and independent
variables were logged, model coefficients were inter-
preted as elasticities, or the percent change in MVPA
bouts predicted from a 1% change in the independent
variable. Time invariant individual-level variables were
included in random effects models but are not estimated
in fixed effects models. Time varying age was included
in both models. Sex interactions with each environmen-
tal variable were tested; for comparability, interaction
terms were retained if significant (Wald p < 0.10) in the
random or fixed effects model. Further interaction with
residential relocation status (Objective 2b) in fixed
effects models was examined by including significant
(Wald p < 0.10; lower order terms were retained) two-
and three-way interactions between residential reloca-
tion status, sex, and each environment measure. When
one or more interactions were included in the model,
group-specific associations were reported.
Results
Individual-level characteristics are presented in Table 2.
68.5% (SE 1.2%) of the analytical sample moved between
Waves I and III (data not shown), and changes in envir-
onmental measures observed between Waves I and III
(Table 3) provided sufficient variability for estimation of
within-person effects, even for non-movers.
Within-person estimates indicated that with 1%
greater pay facilities in the neighborhood, MVPA bouts
were 0.024% higher in males; corresponding associations
were negative but not significant in females (Table 4).

MVPA was negatively associated with crime and, for
females in fixed effects models, marginally with median
household income. Landscape diversity, public facility
availability, and alpha index were unrelated to MVPA.
The Hausman specification test rejected the null
hypotheses (p < 0.001) that there is no correlation
between unexplained person-specific variation and the
independent variables. That is, changes in estimates after
controlling for time invariant, unmeasured characteristics
by applying the within-person estimator were statistically
significant. Compared to random effect estimates, within-
person elasticities were larger for pay facility availability
and, in males, almost two times larger for crime rate. In
females, the within-person estimator attenuated negative
random effects estimates for crime and reversed the asso-
ciation to the counter-intuitive direction (marginally sig-
nificant) for median household income (Table 4).
Several associations varied by residential relocation
status and sex (Table 5). Elasticities between MVPA
bouts and crime were substantially larger in non-movers
than movers, and landscape diversity was negatively
associated with MVPA only in non-movers. Public facil-
ity availability was positively associated with MVPA in
female movers only, with variation in magnitude and
direction by sex- and relocation status. Model coeffi-
cients and p-values corresponding to Tables 4 and 5 are
reported in additional file 2, appendix B.
Discussion
We estimated longitudinal effects of built and socioeco-
nomic environment characteristics on MVPA bouts in a
prospective study of adolescents as they transition into
young adulthood. To our knowledge, ours is the first
study to examine built environment changes resulting
from either residential relocation or changes around sta-
tionary residents. After adjusting for unmeasured time
invariant characteristics, MVPA bouts were higher with
greater availability of pay facilities in males, and lower
with higher crime in males and females. Other associa-
tions were null or in the counter-intuitive direction.
However, we discuss several methodological considera-
tions in the following sections.
Built environment findings in the Add Health population
In contrast to relatively consistent cross-sectional associa-
tions between the built environment and PA in the extant
literature [38,39], many cross-sectional [40] and random
effects associations were weak or null in the Add Health
population. Possible methodological explanations for these
differences include our buffer-based environment mea-
sures and complications related to broad geographic varia-
tion and measurement of complex environments [20].
In another longitudinal, national study, urban sprawl was
weakly related to obesity [8]; however, we expected a
stronger, more robust relationship with PA, a more

proximal outcome. Additionally, theorized behavior-speci-
fic relationships [41] such as promotion of walking for
transit by highly connected streets could not be examined
with our total leisure-time MVPA measure. Of course,
null associations may reflect a lack of causal effects. Ulti-
mately, several naïve estimates (cross-sectional and ran-
dom effects) were null or counterintuitive, so
corresponding within-person estimates cannot be attribu-
ted solely to adjustment for unmeasured time invariant
characteristics.
Residential self-selection bias: upward, downward, or
more complex?
Residential self-selection is typically presented as a posi-
tive confounder which may create or magnify associations
between the built environment and PA [5,6,42]. This
characterization assumes that hypothesized built environ-
ment PA supports are: (1) preferred by or correlated with
other neighborhood characteristics selected by people
with higher PA (e.g., high performing schools), or (2)
uncommon in areas selected by people with generally
lower PA (e.g., lack of resources in affordable neighbor-
hoods). These assumptions are supported by dispropor-
tionate allocation of recreation resources to more affluent
neighborhoods [3,43-45] and by attenuation of relation-
ships between urban form and health-related outcomes
by first difference models [8] and other adjustment meth-
ods [5,46,47].
However, some PA-promoting features may be less
common in advantaged areas. For example, pay facilities
may encourage PA but may be more common in com-
mercial centers potentially selected less often by advan-
taged families (with higher PA levels). In this scenario,
residential self-selection factors are negative confoun-
ders, consistent with stronger positive estimated within-
person (versus random) effects of pay facilities on
MVPA in males.
In contrast, within-person (versus random effects)
estimates of higher crime effects on lower MVPA were
attenuated in females, suggesting that self-selection fac-
tors related to crime may operate differently in females
versus males. That is, crime and safety may play a stron-
ger role in not only MVPA but also selection of a neigh-
borhood in females than in males. Overall, these results
suggest that residential self-selection may magnify or
attenuate built environment-PA associations and
involves multifaceted relationships among complex
environments and sex-specific determinants of residen-
tial selection and PA.
Furthermore, concerns that selection of neighbor-
hoods based on activity-related amenities can explain
positive environment-PA associations [5] suggests posi-
tive confounding but not necessarily absence of causal
effects. That is, selected amenities may help active
individuals to maintain or increase their activity levels,
formally defined as "effect in the treated" [48]. Alterna-
tively, "effect in the untreated" would support placement
of activity-related amenities in areas of greatest need.
Investigation of heterogeneous effects may clarify the
potential value of various built environment modifica-
tion strategies.
Within-person estimators applied to a life transition
period
Within-person estimators control for unmeasured char-
acteristics that remain constant over time, a major
strength for addressing residential selection factors,
which are challenging, if not impossible, to measure
accurately [6]. However, examination of neighborhood
effects during the adolescence to young adulthood tran-
sition raises several complications:
Time varying characteristics
Within-person estimators do not control for unmeasured
characteristics which change over time. Residential relo-
cation is typically triggered by marriage, childbearing,
employment opportunities [16], or other events which
characterize the adolescent to young adulthood transition
[49] and may lead to changes PA. Sedentary employment
or intensive schooling in young adulthood may reduce
PA levels, overwhelming any built environment effects on
PA. Such events may also influence the type of neighbor-
hood selected, thus comprising time varying, potentially
unmeasured confounders.
Because these events are rare in adolescence, there
was insufficient variability in Wave I for analysis as time
varying measures. For example, magnification of nega-
tive crime-MVPA associations by within-person estima-
tion in males could be explained by movement into
urban centers (with higher crime) for employment,
which may limit leisure time for PA. Employment may
therefore be a time varying confounder which is unmea-
sured in our study.
Importantly, similar residential relocation triggers may
occur throughout middle and later adulthood, with simi-
lar implications for bias if they are not sufficiently mea-
sured. Further, because residential self-selection may
attenuate estimated relationships, null associations do
not necessarily imply that bias has been fully addressed.
Exploration and development of approaches for addres-
sing time-varying characteristics that are unmeasured is
clearly an important area for future work. Possible stra-
tegies include instrumental variables methods or other
simultaneous equation strategies which model predictors
of residential selection and neighborhood predictors of
behavior or health in two or more stages [6].
Age-specific effects
Our longitudinal models assume constant causal effects
between time points [10], a questionable assumption
Boone-Heinonen et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2010, 7:70
http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/7/1/70

during periods of shifting PA determinants. However,
differences in published cross-sectional associations
between Wave I and III were not statistically significant
[40]. Nevertheless, estimated causal effects in adoles-
cents versus young adults should be further investigated
using longitudinal data and innovative adjustment
strategies.
Residential selection by parents
Residential location was likely determined by parents in
Wave I but respondents in Wave III. Therefore, the source
of unmeasured residential selection factors varied across
waves and may contribute additional bias. However, pre-
vious neighborhood characteristics are the most powerful
predictors of subsequent neighborhood characteristics
[50,51], suggesting that key unmeasured characteristics
may remain constant and carry across generations.
Summary
Within-person estimation has limitations but is particu-
larly relevant for capturing short-term effects theorized
for behavioral outcomes such as PA [10] and is overall a
valuable approach for addressing residential self-selec-
tion bias.
Restriction by residential relocation status: an additional
source of bias?
Biases related to residential stability may be at least as
strong as residential relocation: in the adolescent to young
adulthood transition, individuals may remain in the par-
ent's home for reasons (e.g., care for young children,
unemployment, or attendance at a local college) associated
with health behaviors (outcomes), and neighborhoods
(exposures) change systematically (e.g., disadvantaged
groups more often live in neighborhoods with less advan-
tageous environment trajectories [51]). Thus, conditioning
on residential relocation may induce selection bias.
Indeed, movers and non-movers differ with regard to
individual characteristics in this and prior studies [52]
and to estimated environment-MVPA associations. With
the exception of public facilities, associations were
weaker or equivalent in movers than non-movers, but
these patterns could be reversed in adulthood when
residential stability is the norm.
Differential associations could also reflect different sets
of unmeasured factors that influence residential selec-
tion (in movers) versus changes in neighborhoods
around stationary residents (non-movers). In the full
sample, we expect residential selection factors to domi-
nate because the majority of the sample moved between
Waves I and III. However, distinguishing between selec-
tion bias and differential confounding is complex and
requires future research using analytical methods such
as marginal structural models that can address reloca-
tion status without inducing selection bias through cov-
ariate adjustment or stratification [17].
Strengths and limitations
Limitations of this study include the methodological
concerns raised above. Additionally, our definition of
residential relocation did not capture duration of resi-
dence and may have misclassified respondents who
moved short distances or moved but returned to the
same location by Wave III. Second, changes in socioeco-
nomic environment variables around a given location
may reflect shifts in census boundaries between 1990
and 2000. Also, there was temporal mismatch between
interview data and census and street connectivity data;
in particular, temporal mismatch in Wave I was a trade-
off for greater accuracy of a more current street data-
base. Third, neighborhood buffers delineated by street
network distance may yield different results; however,
population counts needed for our facility availability
measures were not available within network buffer
areas, and environment measures are similar for
Euclidean versus network distance-based buffers. Addi-
tionally, conversion of population within buffers from
population within block groups (Table 1) may have
resulted in measurement error in our facilities availabil-
ity measures and bias of unpredictable direction and
magnitude in corresponding associations with MVPA,
particularly in heterogenous areas. Fourth, our data
sources may have captured relevant neighborhood char-
acteristics more completely in some subgroups (e.g., our
database does not capture PA resources on college cam-
puses), potentially resulting in differential measurement
error by study wave or sociodemographic group. Fifth,
the PA environments at school, workplace, or other
locations were not addressed in this study.
Loss to follow-up and missing individual-level data
could have led to biased estimates. Our leisure time
MVPA frequency measure does not distinguish between
possible behavior-specific effects [41] (e.g. promotion of
active transit versus exercise); incorporate physical activ-
ity duration or intensity; and may have systematically
omitted important activities which could account for the
observed sex differences. Also, while our Wave I MVPA
measure was based on instruments validated in other
epidemiologic child and adolescent studies, modifica-
tions made for Wave III (addition of age-appropriate
activities) has not been validated in young adults. How-
ever, these are tradeoffs for the size and scope of the
Add Health study. Finally, the direction of effect
remains ambiguous, as we examined simultaneous
changes in the environment and in MVPA bouts.
However, our unique time-varying environment data-
base captures residential locations of a large, nationally
representative population followed through a critical life
stage. By including six built and socioeconomic environ-
ment measures shown to adequately represent key
environmental constructs, we addressed environmental

confounders while avoiding collinearity. Our longitudi-
nal data was used to address residential self-selection
bias and explore bias related to residential relocation.
Conclusions
After controlling for residential self-selection bias using
within-person estimators, MVPA bouts were related
only to pay facility availability in males and crime in
males and females in the expected directions. Our
results suggest that the magnitude and direction of resi-
dential self-selection bias can vary across environmental
and individual characteristics. Within-person estimators
are valuable for controlling for residential self-selection
bias, but their application to the adolescence to young
adulthood transition or other major life transitions is
complex. Further research and development of methods
that can address predictors of residential relocation
while simultaneously controlling for unobserved mea-
sures is needed.
