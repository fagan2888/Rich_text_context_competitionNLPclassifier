OKOSUN, IKE S. AND G.E. ALAN DEVER. Abdominal
obesity and ethnic differences in diabetes awareness,
treatment, and glycemic control. Obes Res. 2002;10:
1241­1250.
Objective: To compare racial/ethnic differences in diabe-
tes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control between
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic
Americans. We also determined the impact of abdominal
obesity on racial/ethnic differences in diabetes aware-
ness, treatment, and glycemic control between these pop-
ulation groups.
Research Methods and Procedures: Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) data
were utilized for this study. Diabetes awareness was
defined as acknowledging diabetic status. Diabetes treat-
ment was defined as current use of anti-diabetic medica-
tions, good glycemic control as HbA1c
 8%, and ab-
dominal obesity as waist circumference larger than
expected. The impacts of abdominal obesity on racial/
ethnic differences in diabetes awareness, treatment, and
glycemic control were assessed using logistic regression
analyses. Adjustments were made for age, education,
smoking, alcohol intake, and health insurance.
Results: Rates of diabetes awareness in whites, blacks,
and Hispanics suffering from abdominal obesity were
74%, 30%, and 21% in men and 77%, 32%, and 19% in
women, respectively. Rates of diabetes treatment were
70%, 23%, and 14% in men and 57%, 45%, and 23% in
women, respectively. In men, rates of glycemic control
were 64%, 40%, and 30%, and in women, they were 62%,
51%, and 27%, respectively. Abdominal obesity was
associated with decreased diabetes awareness and glyce-
mic control in women.
Discussion: Subjects with abdominal obesity were found to
have poorer glycemic controls compared to those without
abdominal obesity. Because diabetes prevalences were par-
tially explained by racial/ethnic differences in diabetes
awareness, treatment, and glycemic control, there is a need
to craft diabetes awareness, treatment, and control programs
along racial/ethnic origins.
Key words: diabetes awareness, race, abdominal obe-
sity, glycemic control, diabetes treatment
Introduction
A large body of epidemiological evidence has shown that
abdominal obesity is a more potent risk factor for many car-
diovascular diseases (CVDs) than generalized obesity (1­6).
In a recent study of the prevalence of abdominal obesity in the
United States, we estimated 24 million adult men and 40
million adult women suffered from abdominal obesity (7). The
tendency of both abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes to
coexist (8­11) suggest that the high prevalence of type 2
diabetes in the United States may be caused by the high
prevalence of abdominal obesity, particularly among non-
Hispanic blacks and Hispanics (7). Abdominal obesity is
one of the factors in the constellation of plurimetabolic
abnormalities termed insulin resistance syndrome (8­14).
Other factors of the insulin resistance syndrome are hyper-
tension, hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia, glucose
intolerance, and hypertriglyceridemia (9­14).
Available data show that non-whites experience rates of
type 2 diabetes and end-stage sequelae of diabetes that are
higher than those experienced by whites (15­17). Micro-
vascular complications of the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and
lower extremity amputations are also more common among
non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics than non-Hispanic
whites (18­20). Although the reasons for these racial/ethnic

disparities are not clear, some investigators suggest that
differences in diabetes awareness, treatment, and control
may be associated with the higher prevalence of these
complications in non-whites (21). Because of the destruc-
tive nature of diabetes (organ damage), understanding
awareness, treatment, and control rates in different popula-
tion groups and the impact of abdominal obesity are imper-
ative in designing prevention regimens for various popula-
tions. However, much of the available research has been
restricted to the role of generalized adiposity rather than the
more potent abdominal obesity.
Despite racial/ethnic differences in the rate of abdominal
obesity, no studies have investigated the impact of abdom-
inal obesity in diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic
control in American adults. Many studies investigating di-
abetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control have
used liberal definitions of type 2 diabetes (22) and body
mass index (BMI) as a measure of adiposity (23,24). Be-
cause the proposed connection between abdominal obesity
and CVD may be caused by the initiating effect of abdom-
inal obesity for glucose intolerance (25), we hypothesize
racial/ethnic differences in rates of diabetes awareness,
treatment, and glycemic control. We also theorize that be-
cause of the potent nature of abdominal obesity, subjects
with larger than expected waist girths would be more likely
to be aware of their diabetes status, seek treatment for
diabetes, and also would be more likely to maintain good
glycemic control.
We took advantage of Third U.S. National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to describe
and compare racial/ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes
awareness, treatment, and glycemic control in American
adults. The National Institutes of Health anthropometric
surrogate measure (waist circumference) of abdominal obe-
sity and the new American Diabetes Association criteria for
diabetes (26) were employed. In 1997, American Diabetes
Association Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Clas-
sification of Diabetes Mellitus redefined type 2 diabetes as
diagnosed diabetics on insulin or other hypoglycemic
agents, a fasting blood sugar (FBG) value of 126 mg/dL or
greater, or a 2-hour postglucose load (PGL) of 200 mg/dL or
greater in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (26). In
this study, we also sought to determine the impact of ab-
dominal obesity in diabetes awareness, treatment, and gly-
cemic control in non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
and Hispanic-American adults.
Research Methods and Procedures
Data Source
The National Center for Health Statistics provided the
NHANES III data that were used in this study. The sampling
and measurement procedures have been described extensively
in detail previously by other investigators (27,28). Briefly,
NHANES III is a multistage probability sample of noninstitu-
tionalized U.S. population groups defined and examined in
two phases between 1988 and 1994. Only subjects identi-
fied as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic
American were eligible for this investigation.
Because blood postprandrial glucose analysis was done
only among adults 40 years of age and older in NHANES
III, this study was restricted to this age group for whom
health insurance status and anthropometric variables, in-
cluding weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) were
obtained. This study was further restricted to subjects for
whom glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c
) levels were as-
sayed in NHANES III. Weight was measured at a standing
position using a Toledo self-zeroing weight scale (Seritex,
Carlstadt, NJ). Height was measured at a standing position
with a stadiometer. Waist measurement was made at the nat-
ural waist midpoint between the lowest aspect of the rib cage
and highest point of the iliac crest to the nearest 0.1 cm.
Details of the methods used for blood collection and
plasma glucose assays have been described elsewhere by
other investigators (29,30). Briefly, plasma glucose was
measured using a modified hexokinase enzymatic method
(29,30). HbA1c
level was assayed using high-performance
liquid chromatography as used by Diabetes Control and
Complications Trials.
Given that the prevalence of type 1 diabetes varies mark-
edly with race/ethnicity and is much higher in undiagnosed
non-Hispanic whites than the other two groups, it is unlikely
to be undiagnosed or be denied and presumably will always
be treated because type 1 diabetics are more aware of their
diabetes status. Thus, the non-Hispanic whites are likely to
have higher treatment and probably better control than
Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks. Hence, in this analysis,
subjects with type 1 diabetes were excluded.
Those who were excluded because of missing variables
of interest were not different from the population examined
in our study.
Definition of Terms
Type 2 diabetes was defined as diagnosed diabetics on
insulin or other hypoglycemic agents or FBG value 126
mg/dL or a 2-hour PGL 200 mg/dL in OGTT (26). Ab-
dominal obesity was defined as WC larger than expected
(measured waist girth minus girth predicted from BMI)
(31). Predicted WC values were calculated from residuals
obtained from linear regression of WC on BMI. For men,
the residuals were obtained from the following equation:
WC  2.38  BMI  34.15; R2  0.83. The corresponding
residuals for women were obtained from the following
equation: WC  1.98  BMI  38.60; R2  0.79. The
positive residuals represent abdominal obesity adjusted for
generalized adiposity (31).
In NHANES III, subjects were asked the following ques-
tion: have you ever been told by a doctor that you have
Abdominal Obesity and Diabetes, Okosun and Dever

diabetes or sugar diabetes? Diabetes awareness was defined
as answering yes to the question. Diabetes treatment was
defined as current use of insulin and other anti-diabetic
medications. Glycemic control was defined using glycosy-
lated hemoglobin levels (32). Good glycemic control was
defined as HbA1c
of 8% (33) among diabetics.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical programs available in SPSS for Windows
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) were used for this analysis (34).
Because of the complex sampling technique used for
NHANES III, the SUDAAN statistical program (Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) was used to
obtain variance estimates. Differences in anthropometric
variables, blood glucose, and other continuous variables
were assessed by comparing mean values for subjects with
abdominal obesity and subjects lacking abdominal obesity,
stratified by race/ethnicity and gender.
2 statistics were used to test differences in diabetes
awareness, treatment, and glycemic control across adiposity
status. Rate of diabetes awareness was calculated as the
number of diabetics aware of their diabetes divided by total
number of diabetics defined as diagnosed diabetics (FBG
value 126 mg/dL or a 2-hour PGL 200 mg/dL in
OGTT). Rate of diabetes treatment was calculated as num-
ber of diabetics receiving anti-diabetic medication divided
by the total number of diabetics aware of their diabetes
status. Rate of glycemic control was calculated as the num-
ber of diabetics with HbA1c
8% divided by the number of
diabetics aware of their diabetes status.
Race/ethnic and gender specific multiple logistic regres-
sion analyses were performed to determine the impact of
abdominal obesity in racial/ethnic variations on diabetes
awareness, treatment, and glycemic control. Statistical ad-
justments were made for age, education, alcohol intake,
smoking, and health insurance coverage. Ninety-five per-
cent confidence limits and p values were calculated and
used to establish statistical significance.
Results
Subject characteristics for the 3038 non-Hispanic whites,
1650 non-Hispanic blacks, and 1646 Hispanics that were
eligible for this investigation are summarized in Tables 1
and 2. Generally, men and women with abdominal obesity
were older, taller, and heavier as measured by weight than
subjects without abdominal obesity. Men and women with
abdominal obesity also had larger waist girths than subjects
without abdominal obesity. There were no significant racial/
ethnic differences between subjects with abdominal obesity
and those without abdominal obesity in terms of generalized
body fatness as determined by BMI. However, non-His-
panic black women presented with overall mean fatness
equal to the obesity levels as defined by National Institutes
of Health and World Health Organization (23,24). Subjects
with abdominal obesity were less educated than subjects
without abdominal obesity (p  0.05).
As expected, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Hispanics with abdominal obesity had higher values of
FBG and OGTT than those without abdominal obesity (p

and OGTT than their non-Hispanic counterparts (p  0.01).
Subjects with abdominal obesity tended to have higher
values of HbA1c
compared with subjects without abdominal
obesity, and non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics had higher
values of HbA1c
than non-Hispanic whites.
Whereas the prevalence of smoking was higher in men
and women with abdominal obesity, the prevalence of al-
cohol use tended to be higher in subjects without abdominal
obesity. Overall, only 212 (3.5%) eligible subjects for this
study did not have health insurance coverage. There were no
statistically significant racial/ethnic differences with respect
to number of subjects lacking health insurance coverage.
There were statistically significant racial/ethnic differ-
ences in rates of type 2 diabetes (Figure 1) in abdominally
obese and nonabdominally obese subjects. Prevalences of
diabetes in men with abdominal obesity were 18.9%, 23.9%,
and 29.4% in non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and
Hispanics, respectively. The analogous values in women were
16.4%, 18.3%, and 30.2%, respectively. Prevalences of diabe-
tes in men without abdominal obesity were 12.9%, 11%, and
18.2% in non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and His-
panics, respectively. The corresponding values in women were
11.3%, 7%, and 18.1%, respectively.

control stratified by sex and race/ethnicity are shown in

trol in non-Hispanic black women, rates of diabetes treat-

subjects without abdominal obesity compared with subjects
with abdominal obesity. Rates of diabetes awareness were
higher in non-Hispanic white men and women compared
with their non-Hispanic black and Hispanic counterparts (p 
0.05). Rates of diabetes treatment among subjects who were
aware of their diabetic conditions tended to be higher in non-
Hispanic white men and women compared with their non-
Hispanic black and Hispanic counterparts (p  0.05). Except
in men, rates of good glycemic control among subjects who
were aware of their diabetes conditions were higher in non-
Hispanic whites compared with other groups (p  0.05).
Rates of diabetes awareness in non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Hispanic men suffering from abdomi-
nal obesity were 74%, 30%, and 21%, respectively. The
corresponding values in women were 77%, 32%, and 19%,
respectively. Rates of diabetes treatment in non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men with abdom-
inal obesity were 70%, 23%, and 14%, respectively, and in
women were 57%, 45%, and 23%, respectively. Rates of
glycemic control in non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Hispanic men with abdominal obesity were 64%,
40%, and 30%, respectively, and in women were 62%, 51%,
and 27%, respectively. Rates of diabetes awareness in non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men
without abdominal obesity were 80%, 50%, and 40%, re-
spectively. The analogous rates for women without abdom-
inal obesity were 79%, 42%, and 30%, respectively. Rates
of diabetes treatment in non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Hispanic men without abdominal obesity were
89%, 34%, and 60%, respectively. The analogous rates for
women without abdominal obesity were 79%, 53%, and
66%, respectively. Rates of glycemic control in non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men without
abdominal obesity were 71%, 41%, and 73%, respectively.
The corresponding rates for women without abdominal obe-
sity were 82%, 41%, and 34%, respectively.
We used race/ethnic- and sex-specific logistic regres-
sion analysis to determine the effect of abdominal obesity
in diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control,
adjusting for age, education, smoking, alcohol intake,
and health insurance coverage (Table 3). In men, abdom-
inal obesity was not significantly associated with diabe-
tes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control. In men,
increase in age was associated with decreased diabetes
awareness in non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics. Higher
educational attainment was associated with increased di-
abetes awareness in non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Hispanic men. Smoking was associated with
increased diabetes awareness and glycemic control in
non-Hispanic white men. Alcohol intake was associated
with increased glycemic control in non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men. Having health
insurance coverage was also associated with increased
diabetes treatment in non-Hispanic white men and non-
Hispanic black men. In women, increase in age was
associated with decreased diabetes awareness in Hispan-
ics. Increased education was associated with diabetes
awareness in women of the three racial/ethnic groups,
and health insurance coverage was associated with in-
creased diabetes awareness in non-Hispanic black women
and increased glycemic control in non-Hispanic white
and non-Hispanic black women.
We tested the contribution of abdominal obesity in racial/
ethnic variations in diabetes awareness, treatment, and glyce-
mic control, adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol use, and health
insurance status (Table 4). Hispanic men had decreased dia-
betes awareness, whereas non-Hispanic black and Hispanic
men had decreased glycemic control, relative to non-Hispanic
white men, adjusting for abdominal obesity and other con-
founding variables. Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women

had decreased diabetes awareness and glycemic control, rela-
tive to non-Hispanic white women, adjusting for abdominal
obesity and other covariates. Adjusting for abdominal obesity,
smoking was also associated with increased diabetes aware-
ness and glycemic control in both men and women.
Discussion
A large body of epidemiological data now suggests
that abdominal obesity is the most important adiposity
phenotype that is associated with CVD (1­6). First de-
scribed as gynoid and android body habitus some 40
years ago (35), the exact role of abdominal obesity in
CVD is not clear. However, the role of abdominal obesity
in type 2 diabetics may be connected with its high degree
of correlation with visceral adiposity (35). Visceral adi-
posity is the component of body composition that is most
highly associated with components of the insulin resis-
tance syndrome (36,37).
To our knowledge, no studies have described the impact
of abdominal obesity in racial/ethnic differences in type 2
diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control in
American adults. This is also the first study to examine
diabetes awareness, treatment, and control in subjects suf-
fering from abdominal obesity defined as a larger than
expected waist circumference. Understanding racial/ethnic
differences in diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic
control is critical in implementing efficient diabetes man-
agement in different population groups. Being national and
representative in scope, NHANES III represents an excel-
lent data source for investigating racial/ethnic variations in
diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control. The
quality control measures instituted in NHANES III give an
added credence to the data.
In this study, there were racial/ethnic differences with
respect to diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic
control in abdominally and nonabdominally obese Amer-
icans. Subjects with abdominal obesity were found to
have poorer glycemic controls compared with those with-
out abdominal obesity. Rates of diabetes awareness were
higher in non-Hispanic whites with abdominal obesity
compared with non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics with
abdominal obesity. Non-Hispanic whites with abdominal
obesity had significantly better glycemic control and
higher treatment rates than non-Hispanic blacks and His-

panics with abdominal obesity. Relative to non-Hispanic
whites, the result of this investigation shows that being
Hispanic was associated with decreased diabetes aware-
ness and glycemic control, adjusting for abdominal obe-
sity. Relative to non-Hispanic white women, being a
non-Hispanic black woman was also associated with de-
creased diabetes awareness and glycemic control, adjust-
ing for abdominal obesity.
The observed high rates of diabetes awareness in both
subjects with abdominal obesity and subjects without
abdominal obesity in this study are similar to the findings
of Gnasso et al. (38) based on a population from southern
Italy. With the exception of glycemic control in non-Hispanic
black women, rates of diabetes awareness, treatment, and gly-
cemic control were higher in subjects without abdominal
obesity compared with subjects with abdominal obesity.

The lack of significant association between some of the
independent variables with diabetes awareness, treatment,
or glycemic control in this study is consistent with the
findings of Gnasso et al. (38). However, unlike Gnasso et al.
(38), we found significant associations between smoking
and diabetes awareness in non-Hispanic white men and
between smoking and glycemic control in non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men.
The factors behind the lack of awareness of diabetes or
poor glycemic control by women with larger than expected
wait circumference are not clear and warrant further inves-
tigation. Because of the potent nature of abdominal obesity,
we expected that subjects with larger than expected waist
girths would be more likely to be aware of their diabetes
status, seek treatment, and maintain a better glycemic con-
trol than subjects who do not have larger than expected
waist girths. The reason for the positive association between
smoking and the dependent variables in this study is also not
clear and may be related to concomitant diseases.
Some limitations are noteworthy in the interpretation of
results from this study. First, bias because of survey non-
response and missing values for some variables cannot be
ruled out. However, previous studies of National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys have shown little bias be-
cause of nonresponse (39). Second, in this study, residuals
from the linear regression of WC on BMI were used to
estimate abdominal obesity. Although it may be argued that
using the recommended WC cut-points (40­43) would have
been more intuitive because they are more often used in the
literature, we choose to use residual values because the
recommended WC cut-points were determined using other
populations. Indeed, our previous studies show racial/ethnic
differences in the WC cut-points that are associated with
some CVD (44). However, the validity and reliability of
residuals against other measures of abdominal obesity such
as magnetic resonance imaging are not known and warrant
investigation. Third, the exclusion of subjects having dia-
betes managed with diet in our definition of diabetes treat-
ment could potentially bias the results because management
of type 2 diabetes with diet is not uncommon. Fourth, some
important chronic complications variables of diabetes in the
different groups were not included in this study. Diabetes
awareness is expected to increase among subjects with
established chronic diseases, such as ischemic heart disease.
Fifth, it may be argued that using HbA1c
8% for the
definition of good glycemic control may have introduced
bias into our analysis because this was not the standard
recommended by any established guideline at the time
NHANES III data were collected. However, using the above
cut-point value provides valuable information about the
state of glycemic control of subjects at the time of survey
based on the current guideline. Sixth, several well-known
factors that can have impact on diabetes (e.g., diet and exer-
cise) were not examined. These unmeasured risk factors may
have significant implications in the magnitude of the observed
differences of the association between abdominal obesity
and diabetes awareness, treatment and glycemic control.
The lower prevalence of abdominal obesity in non-Hispanic
blacks, particularly non-Hispanic black women, despite higher
BMI is consistent with the findings of Lovejoy et al. (45),
Duncan et al. (46), and Conway et al. (47). The implication of
this paradox for the observed higher prevalence of type 2
diabetes and CVD in non-Hispanic blacks compared with other
populations warrants further study. The poor glycemic control
for non-Hispanic black men that was observed in this study is
consistent with what has been observed with respect to blood
pressure control in black men (48). This observation may be
attributed to cultural and gender differences in the use of health
care systems. According to some investigators, absence of
financial difficulty, described in terms of full medical insur-
ance coverage, does not offer advantage to health care use in
some ethnic groups (49). Other investigators have argued that
racial/ethnic differences in disease awareness, treatment, and con-
trol may be a function of patient self-care and physician medical
practices rather than the influence of race or ethnicity (18).
Discussion
The result of this investigation indicates that racial/ethnic
differences in the prevalence of diabetes may be partially
explained by their differences in diabetes awareness, treatment,
and glycemic control. The lower rates of diabetes awareness,
treatment, and glycemic control in non-Hispanic blacks and
Hispanics, despite having higher prevalence of diabetes com-
pared with non-Hispanic whites, suggests crafting diabetes
awareness, treatment, and glycemic control programs accord-
ing to racial/ethnic origins. The lack of significant positive
association of abdominal obesity with diabetes awareness,
treatment, and glycemic control in these populations groups
may indicate lack of knowledge about the harmful effect of
abdominal obesity. Racially/ethnically sensitive public health
messages may help to increase diabetes awareness, treatment,
and glycemic control in these population groups.
