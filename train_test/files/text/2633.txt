The Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins is a study of dementia in a defined population of twins. The goals
included estimating heritability of Alzheimer's disease and identifying risk and protective factors in twin
pairs discordant for the disease. The data, including not only diagnoses and age of onset but also extensive
information about potential environmental risk factors, are now archived as Study ICPSR 25963 at National
Archive for Computerized Data on Aging, Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, at
the University of Michigan, and available for researchers to use. Up to the time of archiving, 215 cases of
dementia have been identified from a base sample of 2,394 individuals.
Keywords: twins, heritability, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, epidemiology
The Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins (sometimes re-
ferred to as `SALZA') was launched in 1984 to identify all
cases of dementia within the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study
of Aging (SATSA). SATSA has been described in prior com-
pilations of twin registers in this journal (Pedersen et al.,
2002) and its predecessor (Pedersen et al., 1991). SATSA is
itself a selected subset of the Swedish Twin Register (STR);
specifically, SATSA is comprised of all STR twins who were
separated and reared apart and a matched sample that were
reared together. Because we superimposed a dementia study
on an ongoing registry-based study of normal aging, the
sample is population-based and is not limited to insti-
tutionalized cases or to those who have sought medical
treatment.
In this article, we describe the SALZA study and available
database archived at the National Archive for Computerized
Data on Aging, Inter-university Consortium for Political
and Social Research, at the University of Michigan, in order
to encourage use by other researchers.
Sample
The SATSA population was comprehensively identified
from the STR to include all reared apart pairs and a matched
reared together sample. At baseline in 1984, 2,845 of these
individuals were alive from a total of 1,919 pairs (3,838 indi-
viduals). However, not all twins responded to initial mailed
SATSA questionnaires. For the dementia study, in addition
to screening SATSA responders, we attempted to contact
all of those non-responders who were born 1935 or earlier
in order to have a comprehensive ascertainment of cases
within this defined population. Individuals were included
if they were alive in 1987 and if they were in the SATSA
population as originally drawn, whether or not they had
ever responded to any SATSA data collection effort, and
whether or not their twin sibling was alive. The resulting
base sample for SALZA consisted of 2,394 individuals.
Cognitive Screening Protocol
We employed telephone cognitive screening with non-
responders. The interview protocol is referred to as TELE
(Gatz et al., 1995). The TELE for twins includes a brief
mental status test and questions about health and daily
functioning. If twins did poorly on the cognitive screening
or if we could not reach the twin, we sought to interview an
informant. The informant version of TELE asks about the
twin's memory and cognitive problems.
For twins participating in SATSA in-person testing, in-
stead of telephone screening, we used their score on the
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al.,
1975) that was administered as part of SATSA in-person
testing. Any twin who met cutoffs on either the TELE or
MMSE was invited to a complete clinical workup, as were
their co-twins.

Screening began during the second wave of SATSA
data collection and was repeated after each successive
wave of SATSA in order to identify incident cases of
dementia.
Clinical Assessment and Diagnosis
A physician and a psychologist visited each twin at home
and completed a full clinical evaluation for dementia, in-
cluding cognitive tests, physical exam, medical history, and
aninformant'sdescriptionofthecourseofcognitivedecline.
Where possible, the twins were also referred for diagnostic
neuroimaging, involving a CT at a local hospital. Individual
images of the entire head were typically taken parallel to the
orbitomeatal line, with CT performed without contrast un-
less contrast was necessary for clinical reasons. A consensus
conference including members of the assessment teams and
an independent clinician considered all of the information
and arrived at a clinical diagnosis, including whether there
was dementia present, age of onset, and type of dementia.
Initially, diagnostic decisions were guided by DSM-III-R
criteria for dementia (American Psychiatric Association,
1987), NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable and possible
Alzheimer's disease (McKhann et al., 1984), and other cri-
teria for other subtypes. As they became available, NINDS-
AIREN criteria were used for vascular dementia (Roman
et al., 1993), and DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, 2000) was used in addition to DSM-III-R.
Both members of twin pairs were followed longitudi-
nally. Pairs where both were non-demented continued to
be followed by SATSA. The same diagnostic procedures
were used when incident cases were found from longi-
tudinal evaluations of twins who had been diagnosed as
not demented at first assessment or in later waves of
SATSA.
Because SATSA has continued to collect data at approx-
imately three-year intervals, we have added new cases of
dementia identified at subsequent waves of SATSA. The
archived database currently continues through the sixth
wave of in-person testing, with dementia diagnoses through
2004. In all, 215 twins were considered demented and given
a differential diagnosis for dementia.
DNA Collection
Blood collected during the clinical evaluation has been used
for clinical chemistries, DNA extraction, and confirmation
of zygosity using microsatellite markers (Lichtenstein et al.,
2002) whenever not available from the STR or SATSA.
Questionnaires
At the time of the clinical workup, the twin and an in-
formant were extensively interviewed with respect to family
history, medical risk factors, and environmental risk or pro-
tective factors. Twins were asked to provide a comparative
rating whether oneself or ones twin had greater exposure to
a variety of putative risks (Reynolds et al., 2005). Question-
naire forms as well as the resulting data are included with
the archived database. Additionally, all SATSA twins were
asked similar questions about risk and protective factors in
the third wave of in-person testing and in the fourth wave
of mailed questionnaires, comprising prospective informa-
tion for incident cases, and also included with the archived
database.
The public-use data cover background information; ages
at each data collection point; cognitive screening; clini-
cal dementia diagnoses; cognitive test results; medical his-
tory and medical risk factors; residential, occupational, and
leisure activities history; family history of dementia; and
APOE genotype (see Table 1 for N of participants with
each data element).
Previously Collected Data
Because SALZA twins were from the STR, data collected
from STR surveys in the 1960s or 1970s provide prospective
information about midlife risk or protective factors, e.g.,
participation in leisure activities. For those SALZA twins
who participated in SATSA prior to being identified for
SALZA, there are cognitive test results from the time prior
to dementia onset and prospective risk or protective factors
from both questionnaires, e.g., personality, and biomarkers,
e.g., cholesterol levels. Further, because the STR is regularly
linked with the Swedish Patient Registry, information is
available about hospitalization for diseases such as heart
disease or diabetes prior to dementia onset.
Research Approach
Analyses using SALZA data include estimating heritabil-
ity of Alzheimer's disease (Gatz et al., 1997; Pedersen
et al., 2001; Ripatti et al., 2003) and applying a discor-
dant twin pair design to identify risk and protective factors
where results from matched pairs are compared to case-
control results (e.g., Gatz et al., 2001; Wetherell et al., 1999).
Combined SATSA and SALZA data are analyzed with lon-
gitudinal growth and survival methods. Genetic analyses
use combined data from multiple Swedish twin studies of
aging.
Archiving the data makes it possible for other investiga-
tors not only to use the data for new analyses but also to
pool with other dementia studies.
Subsequent Work
As described in prior special issues of this journal on twin
registers (Lichtenstein et al., 2006; Pedersen et al., 2002),
beginning in 1998, all twins in the Swedish Twin Reg-
istry born before 1958 were screened by telephone for the
most common complex diseases in the effort known as
Screening Across the Lifespan Twin (SALT) study. Several

studies with additional data collection from twins with
a specific disease were launched, including an expanded
Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins (Gatz et al., 2005),
known as HARMONY. Data from HARMONY for SALZA
twins are included in the SALZA archive. Other HAR-
MONY data are presently being prepared for data archiving
at the National Archive for Computerized Data on Aging,
but meanwhile are being used in multiple international
collaborations.
