THE ECONOMICS
OF EMPLOYER
VERSUS INDIVIDUAL
MANDATES
by Alan B. Krueger and Uwe E. Reinhardt
Prologue: America's belief in solving large problems through
private/public collaboration has not guaranteed a solution to
President Clinton's quest for universal health insurance cover-
age. The administration's proposed requirement that all employ-
ers provide their workers with health insurance coverage has
been attacked by the small-business community and most Re-
publicans as too regulatory for the American appetite. The ad-
ministration's plan also would require that unemployed and self-
employed persons be subjected to a coverage mandate. In this
paper economists Alan Krueger and Uwe Reinhardt argue: "If
policymakers wish all Americans to have portable health insur-
ance coverage, they must mandate that coverage. . . . Absent a
mandate, millions of American families would simply choose to
remain uninsured." Krueger and Reinhardt, both of whom are
professors of economics at Princeton University, discuss the fi-
nancing of health care, explaining how most practitioners of
their discipline view a mandate on employers to provide health
insurance to their workers. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor
of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton's Woodrow
Wilson School. He is coeditor of the Journal of Economic Per-
spectives and has published widely on labor market issues. He
received his doctorate in economics from Harvard. Reinhardt is
a well-known figure in health policy circles in the United States
and abroad. A born teacher and a naturalized American,
Reinhardt spent his early years in Germany, but he took his uni-
versity training in Canada and at Yale University, from which
he earned a doctorate in economics. Reinhardt has eclectic intel-
lectual tastes. While a strong believer in markets, he also recog-
nizes Canada's tax-financed health care system and Germany's
social insurance scheme as approaches that provide their popula-
tions equitable protection against the uncertain nature of illness.

ECONOMICS OF MANDATES 35
Abstract: This paper reviews the economic implications of employer and individual health insurance
mandates. Although the cost of meeting an employer mandate is nominally paid by employers, in the
long run much of the cost may be shifted backward to employees in the form of lower wages. We also
compare the consequences of hypothetical employer and individual health insurance mandates for
families with different income levels. Depending on their structure, an employer mandate may be
more or less progressive than an individual mandate.
Current efforts to reform the American health care system have two
major objectives. First, all Americans are to have adequate health
insurance coverage, a goal commonly defined as universal coverage.
Second, the delivery of health care is to be rearranged to make it more
efficient; that is, the appropriate health care, and only the appropriate care,
is to be given to patients at the lowest feasible cost.
Both of these objectives are to be achieved by rearranging the way
American health care is financed. When exasperated commentators la-
ment that our current debate on health reform is "all about money," they
are literally correct, but they miss the mark. A restructuring of our vast
health care delivery system cannot be achieved through direct government
edict in this country. That restructuring will be sought as a natural response
to the new financial incentives inherent in a rearranged flow of money.
That flow of money can be broken down into two major streams. First,
money must be collected into one or several privately or publicly adminis-
tered insurance funds. Second, money must be disbursed from those collec-
tive insurance funds to the providers of health care. The first facet is
generally referred to as the financing of health care. The second embraces
the issues of reimbursement and cost control.
This paper focuses on the financing of health care. We begin our discus-
sion with some remarks on certain basic facts of life regarding health care
financing--facts that are widely perceived as troublesome and often
avoided. In the next section we explore in some depth the economist's
standard view of one highly controversial method of financing health care:
a mandate upon employers to procure health insurance for their employees
and their dependents. Next we present several simulations that compare
the effects of a hypothetical employer mandate with a hypothetical individ-
ual mandate on U.S. households. Finally, we recommend a compromise
between an employer and an individual mandate: premiums calculated as a
flat percentage levy on the gross wages of the individual employee but
collected at the nexus of the payroll.
Facts Of Life In Health Care Financing

regularly forgotten: (1) Every penny of financing for health care ultimately
must be extracted from private households. Government and business are
mere intermediaries in this flow. (2) If there is to be universal health
insurance coverage, substantial additional transfers of funds must be made
from households in the upper half of the nation's income distribution to
households in the lower half. (3) To achieve truly universal health insur-
ance coverage, households must be mandated to procure that coverage or
employers must be mandated to procure it on behalf of households.
Extracting money from households. The transfer of money from pri-
vate households to the providers of health care can be achieved by three
distinct methods, which span the set of feasible approaches.
Under the first approach, individual households purchase individual
insurance policies directly from private insurance carriers or seek individual
coverage through group policies procured by some private association,
possibly with the support of public subsidies. Less than 10 percent of the
nonelderly U.S. population currently procures private health insurance this
way, so far without any public subsidy whatsoever.1 In fact, nowhere in the
world is this the predominant mode of health care financing.
Under the second approach, government taxes private households and
funnels these taxes to an insurance fund. This approach is favored in
Canada and in many European countries. But even in the United States
more than 42 percent of all national health spending now follows this
route, covering some sixty-three million Americans, or 25 percent of the
population. This public system includes Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid
for the poor, the purely socialized health systems of the Department of
Veterans Affairs, and sundry delivery systems of the Public Health Service.
Finally, under the third approach, private and public employers procure
insurance coverage from private or public insurance carriers. This employ-
ment-based approach is the backbone of the social insurance systems of
Europe, Latin America, and Asia, where the employer's participation in
health care financing has long been mandatory. In the United States about
71 percent of the nonelderly population obtains insurance coverage by this
indirect route, although not so far on a mandatory basis nor in a way that
makes the insurance portable (as it is under social insurance). Of course,
when employers finance health care, they always recoup their outlays,
dollar for dollar, either in the form of higher prices for consumption goods
or through reductions in take-home pay to employees, or both. It follows
that an outright mandate on business to act as this sort of pumping station
indirectly imposes fiscal levies on private households as well. The empirical
question, to be explored further in this paper, is which households are made
to bear what share of the burden.
If one surveyed economists on the question of which of these three

ECONOMICS OF MANDATES 37
approaches to financing health care makes the most sense from the view-
point of economic theory, the winner undoubtedly would be the first
approach, the one actually chosen by less than 10 percent of the American
population. As a matter of principle, economists advocate arrangements
under which consumers, producers, and politicians make decisions based on
incentives that meet two criteria: (1) the incentives are distorted as little as
possible by taxation, and (2) the parties involved are as aware of the
incentives as they can possibly be. It follows from this principle that
individual households should purchase their own health insurance using
their after-tax income and that families with insufficient means to purchase
coverage on their own be subsidized by highly visible, tax-financed public
subsidies that reflect the general public's charitable sentiments.
Subsidizing poor households. Unfortunately, the public subsidies re-
quired to help poor households buy coverage would not be trivial. A typical
health insurance policy now costs around $2,200 for an individual and close
to $5,000 for a family of four or more, even ifpurchased at community-rated
premiums established for large groups of insured people. As the distribution
of family income in the United States indicates, possibly as many as 20
percent of American households--and certainly the bottom 15 percent--
would have great difficulty absorbing such a premium in their relatively
meager budget (Exhibit 1).
Just where one sets the threshold at which public assistance needs to be
given is, of course, a purely subjective matter. It lies at the heart of our
current debate on health policy. Commenting on Rep. Jim Cooper's (D-
TN) well-known reform plan, for example, The New York Times recently
opined in its lead editorial:

He [Congressman Cooper] would provide subsidies for families earning twice the poverty-
line income or less to buy insurance through cooperatives. But that could still mean a family
earning $30,000 would have to buy a $5,000 policy on its own. Mr. Cooper calls that
universal access; we call it merciless.2
The New York Times's notion of "merciful" health reform implies that
the health insurance coverage of close to the entire bottom half of the U.S.
income distribution be partially or fully subsidized by the upper half. The
total flow of such subsidies could easily exceed $100 billion, depending
upon the generosity of the benefit package covered by the insurance, the
degree of cost control imposed on providers, and the precise cutoff line for
the subsidies. Of course, many such cross-subsidies are already being made
by our current health system, albeit in a pattern that does not fit any known
social ethic. These subsidies flow helter-skelter, in all directions.
The twenty-nine million low-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid
evidently are beneficiaries of a top-to-bottom income redistribution. So are
many low-income elderly Americans enrolled in both Medicare and Medic-
aid. But there are also many well-to-do elderly who extract from Medicare
much more than they deposited in it during their work years and who now
find themselves the happy recipients of billions of dollars in outright charity
from below.3 To these subsidized, well-to-do elderly should be added the
lucky millions of high-income employees whose companies purchase for
them health insurance out of pretax income. This is a tax shelter known to
bestow the bulk of the implied "tax expenditure" on the upper-income
groups. To families in low tax brackets, this tax shelter means only a
handful of dollars; to families in the upper-income groups, it can mean
$2,000 tax savings toward the purchase of health insurance. According to
estimates by Lewin-VHI, in 1991 fully 26 percent of the $70 billion or so in
taxes avoided through this shelter went to families earning $75,000 or
more, and only 6 percent to families earning $20,000 or less.4
One of the common arguments against health reform is that this country
simply cannot "afford" to subsidize with public funds further millions of
uninsured low-income Americans. Those who make this argument, how-
ever, must somehow come to grips with the fact that for years Congress has
funneled to the upper levels of the income distribution more funds in
outright subsidies or tax expenditures than it would take to subsidize gener-
ously the insurance coverage of all low-income uninsured Americans. Thus,
the proposition that we just cannot "afford" to fold all of the uninsured
quickly into mainstream American health insurance is unconvincing. A
more accurate statement would be that America's middle and upper classes
are not now willing to redistribute any more funds to lower-income groups,
although the better-off have no objections to a myriad of hidden cross-

subsidies among themselves, or even from middle- to upper-income groups.
The need to mandate health coverage. If policymakers wish all Ameri-
cans to have portable health insurance coverage, they must mandate that
coverage. This is the third basic fact of life in health care reform. Absent a
mandate, millions of American families would simply choose to remain
uninsured, even if they could afford to buy insurance with some subsidies
and some belt tightening. A strategy to remain uninsured is not completely
reckless, because this nation already has a more or less universal cata-
strophic health insurance system: the hospital emergency rooms that are
obligated to treat all comers, and the hospitals attached to these emergency
rooms. Although this safety net is neither perfect nor comfortable, its
existence is an open invitation to free riding in health care.
The simplest but also the most controversial form of such a mandate
would be to bestow upon all Americans tax-financed health insurance, say,
on the Medicare model or on the Canadian model. This approach is now
said to be "off the table," because the American public presumably does not
like it. Although this may be the case, it takes effort to reconcile that
perception with the fierce way America's usually rather conservative elderly
protect their government-financed, government-run Medicare program. So
jealously is that public program guarded by the elderly that no politician
dares touch it. Perhaps there is more latent support for such a system for the
broader U.S. population than seems apparent, possibly because government
programs are more stable and more reliable than private insurance over
time. In part, of course, this loyalty to government-run insurance may
simply show that the elderly know a good deal when they see one.
The only alternatives to mandated, government-financed health insur-
ance for all are (1) a mandate on employers to provide adequate private
coverage for all workers (the "employer mandate"), or (2) a mandate on
households to procure adequate private insurance coverage, either through
purchase of an individual insurance policy directly from a private carrier or
through a group policy voluntarily made available by an employer or any
other association of private individuals (the "individual mandate").
Those who would mandate all employers to provide all employees with
health insurance do not do so on the basis of economic principles or on the
notion that the losers under a public policy should be fully and explicitly
informed of their fate. More probably, these advocates advance the pro-
posal simply as a political expedient. These experts, such as Alain
Enthoven, Richard Kronick, and the Jackson Hole Group, can claim to be
building upon the American tradition of financing health care through the
workplace. There is something to that argument. But it is probable as well
that these astute students of American health politics found it preferable to
erect their health reform plan upon a financing scheme that camouflages

the true impact of health care financing. The political theory here seems to
be that if the true impact were known to the body politic, health reform
would be dead on arrival A similarly pragmatic theory, one must suppose,
lies at the heart of President Clinton's reliance on the employer mandate,
whose basic structure, incidentally, seems to have been copied verbatim
from the dicta of the Jackson Hole Group.
Those who propose the individual mandate as a means to universal
coverage can claim to be inspired by sound economic principles and a
vision of democracy that would like to see all income transfers among
economic classes made highly visible. Unfortunately, that very visibility is
likely to create a political barrier to universal coverage. On the one hand,
citizens who would be summoned to the cashier's window would be more
likely to object if they were taxed explicitly. On the other hand, if low-
income American households were required to pay directly for their health
insurance coverage, they probably would be much more vocal in their quest
for government subsidies than they would be if they were made to pay for
their own health insurance coverage implicitly, through gradual reductions
in pay raises over time--which is the chief mechanism by which an em-
ployer mandate would most likely be financed in the longer run.
The individual mandate triggers the added problem of confronting low-
income families with relatively high losses in incremental disposable in-
come as earned income rises. For example, suppose insurance for families at
or below the official poverty line were fully subsidized by the government
and that subsidy were completely phased out at 200 percent of the poverty
level. Then a family of four would lose a subsidy of about $5,000 (the
typical health insurance premium for such a family) as its income rose from
about $14,000 per year to about $28,000 a year. This melting away of the
subsidy is equivalent to a marginal income tax rate for the loss of health
insurance subsidies alone of about 35 percent ($5,000/($28,000-$14,000).
Added to federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, and the phaseout of
the earned income credit, the individual mandate thus would present
millions of low-income American families with total marginal tax rates in
excess of 75 percent. Such high marginal tax rates may well make unem-
ployment and welfare an attractive alternative to working. It would be the
antithesis to supply-side economics.
Finally, those who espouse the individual mandate and a speedy move
toward universal health insurance coverage must be willing to countenance
a sizable transfer of vouchers to low-income families--on the order of at
least $50 billion to $80 billion a year--if universal coverage were to be
realized within the next few years. On the other hand, if transfers of this
magnitude are not contemplated in connection with an individual man-
date, then one implicitly countenances a lengthy and possibly permanent

postponement of universal coverage.
In what follows, we explore in greater depth the economic theory of
employer mandates. Economists find this theory so plausible that they
rarely seek to explain it to noneconomists, who, alas, typically find the
theory quite implausible. As we point out, this divergence of perception
appears to stem mainly from the length of the time period contemplated.
Business people of the so-called real world tend to posit short time frames in
predicting their reactions to changes in public policy. In the process they
tend to abstract unduly from longer-run effects. Economists, on the other
hand, tend to conduct their inquiries with a method they call "comparative
statics," that is, an examination of the changes a public policy stimulus--
such as the imposition of an employer mandate--has triggered in a market
after the market has fully adjusted to the new policy, over the longer run.
Economists tend to abstract unduly from the short-run dynamics by which
markets actually move from one steady state to the next. The confusion
surrounding the debate on employer mandates, and the apparent divide
between economists and noneconomists over the issue, is a result of these
predilections on the part of both camps.
The Economic Theory Of Employer Mandates
The economic theory of employer mandates is best understood if one
imagines a highly competitive labor market in which workers of a given
level of skill sell some of their time in return for wages. Exhibit 2 is a very

simplified analytic rendering of such a market, as it would be presented to
first-year students in an introductory economics course. Although this
graph may evoke unpleasant memories of college days, practical readers
from the so-called real world may find it worthwhile to invest some time in
mastering this analytic apparatus. First, it provides clues to the mystery of
why there are so many varying estimates of the "job loss" associated with an
employer mandate. Second, it also can help to explain why the magnitude
of the employment effect can sometimes be predicted simply by the politi-
cal allegiance of the academic or the think tank making the estimate.
The vertical axis in Exhibit 2 represents W, the annual wage paid to
workers in this market. The horizontal axis represents the total number of
full-time-equivalent workers (FTEs) per year offered or sought in this
market. We assume initially that the firms here do not offer their employees
any fringe benefits at all, so that total debits also represent employees' total
take-home pay. Although that assumption is not realistic, no major insights
are lost by making it, and much ease of graphic exposition is gained.
It seems plausible to assume that the market's demand for labor is
downward-sloping to the right--that more FTEs will be hired by the
industry as total annual wage per FTE falls. The precise shape and position
of this demand curve depends primarily on two factors. First, other things
being equal, the easier employers in this market find it to substitute labor-
saving capital for labor in the production of output, the flatter (the more
wage-sensitive or "wage-elastic") will be the demand curve for labor.5
Second, the more price-sensitive is consumers' demand for the products
produced by the employers hiring labor in this market, the flatter (the more
wage-sensitive) will be the employers' demand curve for labor.
Similarly, it seems plausible to posit an upward slope for the supply of
labor to this market. The higher the wage offered by employers in this
industry, the more likely will individuals seek gainful employment in it.
The flatter the curve is (the more wage-sensitive), the easier it is to find
roughly equally lucrative employment elsewhere in the economy, or the
more attractive it is simply to stay out of the labor force altogether, perhaps
because good unemployment benefits or welfare support is available.
Suppose the solid demand and supply curves shown in Exhibit 2 repre-
sented the behavior of employers and potential employees in this market
prior to the imposition of an employer mandate. Given the demand and
supply curves depicting that behavior, that market would settle down at a
market-clearing wage of W0
, at which L0
FTEs would be employed. Econo-
mists call this situation "equilibrium."
Now suppose government mandated all employers in the economy to
purchase for their employees a comprehensive health insurance policy.
Suppose further that this insurance cost $H per FTE per year. To keep

ECONOMICS OF MANDATES 43
matters simple, let us assume that the employer are mandated to "pay" 100
percent of the premium. Finally, let us assume that the workers supplying
labor to this market do not value this mandated fringe benefit as something
inherent in the job, perhaps because they would be granted an equally good,
tax-financed package free of charge if they were unemployed.
On these assumptions, how would such a mandate alter the market-
clearing equilibrium in the labor market modeled in Exhibit 2 in the long
run, after the market had ample time to adjust fully to the mandate? As
illustrated, the demand curve in this market would eventually shift down
vertically by precisely the magnitude of the health insurance premium, $H.
This downward shift implies that employers' reaction to the mandate would
be an attempt simply to cut the take-home pay per FTE by exactly $H, so
that at any given level of employment (L), total compensation, including
the premium $H, would be what total compensation had been at that
employment level prior to the mandate.
Some workers employed prior to the mandate would not take this at-
tempted wage cut lying down. As many as L0
-L1
of them would exit this
labor market and possibly quit working altogether. That is what is meant in
the media and in Congress by the so-called employment effect or job loss
effect. As a result of this job loss effect, the new market-clearing take-home
wage actually would not fall from the original W0
by the entire amount of
the premium, that is, by the full $H. Instead, it would fall only to Wl
, by an
amount smaller than the premium $H. The explanation for this phenome-
non is that part of the premium shock would be absorbed by a reduction in
employment rather than a cut in take-home wages.6
Noneconomists, and particularly business people from the so-called real
world, usually do not believe the story implied by Exhibit 2. Few business
people would admit that in the face of an employer mandate costing, say,
$3,000 per employee they would even attempt to cut their workers' wages
by that amount. Most of them would argue that a good portion of the cost
would simply be absorbed by the owners in the form of lower profits or by
workers who would be laid off, and many of them would argue that they
would simply close their business. Economists should have sympathy for
these tales from the real world, but they should not concede too easily.
First, it is not clear how many firms would actually close if all of them
were saddled with exactly the same additional cost per employee. This is an
important point. More often than not, the stories of business closings
presented to policymakers by concerned business people seem to spring
from an imagined scenario in which one firm in the market is saddled with
the additional labor cost of an employer mandate, while all other firms in
the market remain unscathed. But if all firms in the market were made to
bear the same additional labor costs, the bulk of them probably would

44 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Spring (II) 1994
adjust in the short run through a combination of higher prices for their
output, lower wages for their employees, and lower profits for the owners,
and for the most part they could get away with it because all firms would be
pursuing these policies in unison.
Economists are convinced, however, that in the longer run more and
more of the cost of the employer mandate would likely be shifted backward
to employees, not through outright and irritating wage cuts, but through
smaller real (inflation-adjusted) increases in wages than would have been
warranted by long-run productivity gains. In other words, in the longer run
the cost of the employer mandate most likely will be shifted backward to
employees in a gradual manner that many of them may not even notice.
So much for the economic theory of employer mandates. Even at this
rudimentary level, it becomes obvious why the empirical estimates of the
employment effects attributed to the president's employer mandate range
all over the map: The magnitude of that effect depends crucially on the
assumed shape of the labor demand and supply curves--on the assumed
wage-sensitivity (wage-elasticity) of these curves. To gain some insight into
this proposition, the reader may wish to retrace Exhibit 2 with the same
demand curve, but with a much steeper (wage-insensitive) supply curve
that cuts the demand curve at the original equilibrium point. A wage-
insensitive (wage-inelastic) supply curve signifies that most workers in this
market would keep on working even after a large cut in take-home pay,
simply because working elsewhere or not working at all would remain
relatively unattractive. If that assumption is made, it will be seen that the
same employer mandate will cause a relatively larger cut in take-home pay
but a much more modest job loss, even if the labor supply curve did not shift
outward.
On the other hand, suppose the supply of labor in this market were very
wage-sensitive (wage-elastic). Here the reader would retrace Exhibit 2 but
impose on it a very flat supply curve. It would be found that, in this case, the
same employer mandate would cause only a relatively modest cut in take-
home pay but a rather large cut in employment. Workers would quickly
become disillusioned and quit this labor market (and perhaps quit working
altogether), as employers tried to cut their take-home pay. At the extreme,
if these employees were paid the minimum wage, not a penny of the
premium $H could be shifted backward.7 The entire effect of the mandate
would show up in unemployment or increased total compensation per FTE
(and, therefore, increased product prices).
Similarly, if one retraced Exhibit 2, leaving the supply curve as it is but
positing a very flat (wage-sensitive) initial labor demand curve (perhaps
one close to being horizontal), then one would discover that the mandate
would cause a relatively large cut in both take-home wages and employ-

ment, relative to the premandate equilibrium. Employers hiring in this
labor market would not tolerate any significant increase in total compensa-
tion per FTE. Instead, they might simply cut back drastically on production
(some might even shut down) or switch to labor-saving capital. In that
situation, postmandate take-home pay would have declined by virtually the
entire amount $H; the cost of the mandate would have been fully shifted
backward to employees.
Finally, if the demand for labor were extremely wage-insensitive (very
steep), then the wage and employment cuts caused by an employer mandate
would be relatively small. In this case, employers could not easily substitute
labor-saving capital for labor, or they would lose relatively little sales
volume if they raised the prices of their output, or both.
The important public policy insight one gains from exercising the model
in this way is that the estimated wage and job effects attributed to an
employer mandate are powerfully driven by the wage-sensitivity posited for
both the labor demand and the labor supply curves in U.S. labor markets.
Unfortunately, the available empirical literature has yielded wide ranges for
these wage-sensitivities, which permits analysts to pick and choose, within
limits, among the available estimates. In the process, assumptions drive
conclusions.
The preceding model also helps to nail down precisely what economists
might mean by "backward" or "forward" shifting of employer mandates.
Economists assume, correctly in most cases, that when employers bargain
with workers or their union representatives, the "price" employers have in
mind is always total compensation, which one might define as all of the
debits employers must make to the payroll expense account per year and per
FTE. Strictly in terms of accounting, at any market-clearing equilibrium
"price" for labor it must therefore be tautologically true that take-home pay
equals total compensation minus the cost (to the employer) of all fringe
benefits (mandated or voluntary). In an accounting sense, then, it is always
tautologically true that, at any point in time, 100 percent of the cost of
fringe benefits is shifted "backward" to employees in the form of lower
take-home pay. That is not quite the definition of cost shifting that econo-
mists have in mind when they discuss the incidence of a new fringe benefit
mandated on employers. Here economists start with the premandate equi-
librium wage and employment levels and inquire whether, at the new
postmandate equilibrium, employees' take-home pay has decreased by the
full cost of the mandated benefit or by less.
Several other analytic observations should be made about employer
mandates before we leave this topic. First, the labor supply curves of
individual industries are much more wage-sensitive than is the labor supply
curve for the economy as a whole. This is nothing but common sense,

elegantly put. When Industry A cuts wages and other industries do not,
then workers in A will quickly migrate to other industries. The labor supply
curve of that industry is relatively flat. On the other hand, when wages fall
in every industry in the economy, then there is really no place for workers
to go but the unemployment line. It follows that the entire economy's labor
supply curve will be much steeper--much more wage-inelastic. The practi-
cal implication is that one should never assess the effect of an employer
mandate by imagining one single firm, as is so often done in the media or in
testimony before Congress. An employer mandate imposed upon only one
firm in a town and not on that firm's competitors could easily cause that
one firm to shut down. But to reason thus is to succumb to the famous
fallacy of composition, that is, the fact that what is true for a single part of a
system may not be true for the system as a whole.
Second, what has been illustrated above for an industry that does not
offer its employees any health insurance also can help us understand what
an employer mandate would do for an industry that already does offer
employees health insurance voluntarily. In a nutshell, if the cost of the
mandate to employers were identical to the cost already booked by them for
the voluntary program, then the mandate would have no impact on that
industry. On the other hand, as President Clinton claims, an employer
mandate might substantially reduce the cost of health insurance per FTE for
firms that now provide health insurance. This reduction is to be achieved
through general cost controls on the entire health sector and through the
elimination of the cost shift by which insured firms now pay for the health
care of uninsured Americans. But within the pool of firms that now do
insure their employees there would be a redistribution of costs through the
mechanism of community-rated premiums, which would redistribute
health insurance costs from firms with relatively older or sicker employees
to firms with a relatively younger and healthier work force.
For firms or industries experiencing major reductions in health insurance
cost per FTE, the demand curve for labor should shift up. If one traced that
effect in a diagram such as Exhibit 2, one would see both take-home pay
and employment rise as a result of these labor-cost reductions. Some ana-
lysts now commenting on the president's health plan have, indeed, factored
these positive job and wage effects into their estimates of the overall
employment gains or losses associated with the proposed employer man-
date. Others have excluded that effect. Their assumption seems to be that
the president's cost-control program would in all likelihood fail or that, in
any event, the premiums paid by industries now insuring their workers
probably would not fall significantly. Whatever the rationale or motive for
such inclusions and exclusions in particular studies, we have here yet
another source of uncertainty that drives the high variance of job loss

estimates attributed to the president's or any other employer mandate.
Empirical evidence. A relatively small number of studies have exam-
ined the effects of employment-based government mandates on wages and
employment.8 Most support a conclusion that the incidence of an employ-
ment-based mandate falls mainly on employees. In other words, wages tend
to decline in response to increased mandated benefits by almost the full cost
of the benefit. The reduction in wages tends to lessen any adverse effect on
employment.
Distributional Effects Of Mandates: A Simulation
A key issue is how the burden of paying for an employer or an individual
mandate falls across families with different income levels. To examine the
distributional effects, we construct a hypothetical employer mandate and
an individual mandate and evaluate how they affect the family income
distribution. Because our goal here is to illustrate the general distributional
features of employer and individual mandates, we have constructed hypo-
thetical mandates that are easy to model with available data, rather than
ones that closely correspond to particular reform proposals.
The employer mandate that we examine is similar to the financing
scheme used for Social Security. We assume that employers and employees
contribute a combined total of 9.8 percent of each employee's earnings
toward health benefits, subject to maximum earnings of $55,000. The
maximum is set at the worker level, rather than an average firm level or a
family level. We assume that the employment-based mandate only applies
to workers over age eighteen, who work more than ten hours per week, and
who are not full-time students. We assume that the incidence of the
employment-based mandate falls entirely on workers.
The hypothetical individual mandate works as follows. Families are
required to purchase health insurance. We use four family types to deter-
mine insurance premiums (single individuals, single-parent families, mar-
ried couples without children, and married couples with children). We use
the Clinton administration's estimates of the cost of these insurance poli-
cies.9 Families that have income below the poverty level receive a voucher
that covers 80 percent of the cost of their insurance; they are responsible for
contributing the remaining 20 percent. To pay for the vouchers, we add a 9
percent surcharge to the premium contributions for families above the
poverty level. We have set the parameters of the individual and employer
mandates so that they raise the same level of revenue. The average contri-
bution per family with each of these plans is $3,570.
For our estimates of the distributional impact of hypothetical employer
and individual mandates, we base our calculations on the March 1993

Current Population Survey. Family income and labor earnings are for
calendar year 1992. The sample consists of working families whose mem-
bers are under age sixty-five. From these data we calculate the net benefit
(benefit minus contribution), average contribution divided by average fam-
ily income, and average net benefit divided by average family income.
There are several ways to measure the progressivity of the mandates.
Premium contributions relative to income provide one indication of the
"tax" burden faced by each income class. But since premium contributions
are used to provide health benefits, one should take into account the value
of benefits as well.10 If we value the benefits at the estimated cost of
providing them, then the net benefit relative to income provides a broader
measure of the progressivity of the entire program. Exhibits 3 and 4 illus-
trate the distributional effects of the programs.
Perhaps surprisingly, the results of this simulation reveal the employer
mandate to be more progressive than the individual mandate for these
hypothetical plans. For example, the bottom decile of the family income
distribution would contribute 8 percent of family income ($612) under the
employer mandate, and 18 percent of family income ($1,602) under the
individual mandate. The main reason for this disparity is that low-income
families tend to have low labor earnings and thus make relatively low
contributions under the employer mandate. With an individual mandate,
low-income families that are not in poverty will pay a substantial share of
their income toward health care benefits. On the other hand, under the
assumed plans high-income families pay substantially more for benefits
under the employer mandate than under the individual mandate.
The individual and employer mandates look quite similar if the compari-

son is made just for families above or for families below the poverty level.
Under the assumed employer mandate, families in poverty contribute an
average of $587 toward their health benefits, compared with $691 under
the individual mandate. These results are more similar than the decile-level
analysis because several of the bottom-decile families are not in poverty (for
example, many of those composed of single persons).
To show that an individual mandate could be made more progressive
than an employer mandate, we constructed a second hypothetical individ-
ual mandate. In this scenario we assume that families below the poverty
level receive a subsidy that covers 100 percent of their health insurance
costs. This subsidy is gradually phased out for families earning up to 250
percent of the poverty level.11 Families earning over this amount pay their
full premium costs. To pay for the subsidies to low-income families, families
earning above 250 percent of the poverty level are required to pay a
surcharge ranging from 1 percent of income for families with income under
$70,000 to 5 percent of income for families with income exceeding
$100,000. It turns out that this hypothetical individual mandate is more
progressive than the employer mandate described above. For example,
bottom-decile families would contribute only 2 percent of family income

50 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Spring (II) 1994
toward health insurance, and families in the second to the bottom decile
would contribute 7 percent. Families in the top 10 percent of the income
distribution would contribute 8 percent of income toward their own health
insurance and for subsidies for the poor. By contrast, our hypothetical
employer mandate would average 8 percent of income for the two bottom
deciles, and 6.7 percent for the top decile of the income distribution.
The Clinton proposal for an employer mandate, and the various propos-
als for an individual mandate, no doubt would have distributional effects
different from the hypothetical plans we have sketched here. The Clinton
proposal differs from our hypothetical employer mandate in two important
respects: (1) the cap is set at the average firm level, rather than the worker
level; and (2) employer contributions are capped at 80 percent of the
weighted average premium level for families of its workers' type in the
region. Both of these features serve to make the Clinton proposal less
progressive than our hypothetical employer mandate.
Any workable individual mandate will differ from the first plan we have
sketched because the voucher will likely be phased out over a certain
income range. Our first hypothetical plan would give a substantial voucher
to families just under the poverty threshold, but no assistance to families
just above the threshold. This feature obviously would encourage families
earning just above the poverty threshold to cut back on their labor supply
to qualify for a voucher. A common approach to this problem is to gradually
reduce the value of the voucher as family income rises. But if the voucher
were smoothly phased out to avoid labor supply disincentives, it will have
to be offered to a much higher segment of the income distribution, similar
to proposed negative income tax plans. This feature would raise the cost of
an individual mandate while making it more progressive.
Concluding Observations
The main conclusion we draw from these simulations is that the distribu-
tional consequences of an employer mandate are not necessarily worse than
those of an individual mandate, or vice versa. The question therefore arises
whether this particular reform feature deserves the center stage that it now
occupies, and whether reform should be allowed to stumble over a deadlock
on this particular issue. Is there a pragmatic compromise on the matter?
Although American policymakers seem reluctant to look abroad for
insights on American health policy, it really is instructive to examine how
other nations finance their health systems. Unbeknownst apparently to
many American politicians and business executives, who claim that health
spending makes American business uncompetitive in world markets, many
other nations also finance their health care chiefly through the workplace.

That approach lies at the very heart of the social insurance systems that are
so popular the world over. All of these nations, however, have avoided two
major pitfalls of the current U.S. employment-based system. First, they do
not tie an insured family's health insurance to a particular job in a particular
company in a way that makes the family lose that coverage with that
particular job. Second, these insurance schemes do not levy flat insurance
premiums per individual or household, an approach that necessitates the
cumbersome system of subsidies now built into the president's scheme.
Instead, these nations extract at the nexus of the payroll merely a flat
percentage of the individual worker's gross pay. By so doing, these nations
have effectively fudged the politically charged dichotomy of "individual"
versus "employer" mandates, for their approach could be interpreted as
either of the two.
Germany was the first to use that approach; it was introduced there by
Chancellor Bismarck in the late nineteenth century.12 Since that time the
approach has been copied with minor variations by many nations in
Europe, Asia (including Japan), and Latin America. This approach should
not be dismissed as easily as it has been in our health reform debate simply
because it may look to some people like a payroll tax.
Indeed, none of the nations using payroll-based financing of health care
call these levies payroll taxes. In Germany, for example, the levy has always
been called the Beitragssatz, which literally means contribution rate, as
distinct from Steuern, the German word for taxes. In France, the levy is
called Cotisation Sociale, which also means contribution rate and once again
is distinct from impot, the French word for tax. These nations are neither
stupid, nor sloppy or cynical in their use of language. Instead, they appreci-
ate the significant economic, administrative, and political differences be-
tween such contribution rates and genuine taxes. Furthermore, these na-
tions do not let these payroll-based levies flow into the general government
budget, there to be pitted against any other program and possibly to be
diverted to other programs. Rather, the levies flow into special, autono-
mous, and often semiprivate trust funds established solely to finance the
function for which the levy is made. In their national accounts, these funds
are not shown as an integral part of the government sector. They are shown
separately as part of the social budget.
If the employer mandate proposed in the president's health plan were
converted into one more closely resembling the social insurance approach,
many of the distortive notch effects now in the president's plan would
disappear.13 This is so because neither the size of the firm nor the average
payroll per employee for the firm would become parameters that determine
the flow of subsidies. If these subsidies were pegged on the individual's gross
pay, they could be targeted much more precisely onto truly poor house-

holds, either by tax credits or by means of progressive contribution rates. In
effect, the firm-based parameters in the president's plan convert these
subsidies into a scatter shot that wastes many public subsidy bullets on
middle- and upper-income households.
Finally, and very importantly, the social insurance approach makes it
easier to communicate to employees precisely what their health care costs
them individually. While in other countries employers and employees often
share the contribution rate fifty-fifty, in fact, the public discussions on them
are always based on the total. When European workers learn that this total
is X percent of their gross wages, they probably think of that X percent as
their own money. Will American workers think likewise when they are told
that their "company" pays 80 percent of their health insurance premium?
Or will they continue to think of health care as an almost free lunch?
NOTES
1. According to data published by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), in
1992 about 138 million nonelderly Americans obtained their health insurance cover'
age from their employer. Only about nineteen million nonelderly persons had "other
private coverage," much of it probably purchased individually. About thirty-four
million elderly Americans were insured primarily by Medicare (although many of them
had private supplementary coverage or Medicaid coverage), and about twenty-six
million low-income nonelderly Americans were covered by Medicaid. The Depart-
ments of Defense and Veterans Affairs covered seven million Americans. About 38.9
million Americans were classified as "uninsured." EBRI, Sources ofHealth Insurance and

workers do not assign any value to the health insurance policy that is tied to the job.
If employees attached positive value to job-related insurance, the employer mandate
would serve to shift out the labor supply curve, which would mitigate the job loss effect.

minimum wage.
