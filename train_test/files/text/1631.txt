OBJECTIVE -- To examine the association of hyperglycemia, as measured by GHb, with
subsequent mortality in a nationally representative sample of adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We included adults aged 20 years who
participated in Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994) and had
complete information, including baseline diabetes status by self-report and measured GHb (n 
19,025) and follow-up through the end of 2000 for mortality.
RESULTS -- In the overall population, higher levels of GHb were associated with increased
risk of mortality from all causes, heart disease, and cancer. After adjustment for potential risk
factors, the relative hazard (RH) for adults with GHb 8% compared with adults with GHb 6%
was 2.59 (95% CI 1.88­3.56) for all-cause mortality, 3.38 (1.98­5.77) for heart disease mor-
tality, and 2.64 (1.17­5.97) for cancer mortality. Among adults with diagnosed diabetes, having
GHb 8% compared with GHb 6% was associated with higher all-cause mortality (RH 1.68,
95% CI 1.03­2.74) and heart disease mortality (2.48, 1.09­5.64), but there was no increased
risk of cancer mortality by GHb category. Among adults without diagnosed diabetes, there was
no significant association of all-cause, heart disease, or cancer mortality and GHb category.
CONCLUSIONS -- These results highlight the importance of GHb levels in mortality risk
among a nationally representative sample of adults with and without diagnosed diabetes and
indicate that higher levels are associated with increased mortality in adults with diabetes.

Hperglycemia has been associated
with a wide range of adverse out-
comes for individuals with glucose
values both above and below the thresh-
old for diabetes, including increased car-
diovascular disease (CVD) and mortality
(1). Studies have consistently found un-
diagnosed diabetes to be associated with
increased risk of mortality (2­4), and
many studies have also shown levels of
glucose that are elevated, but not enough
for a diagnosis of diabetes, such as im-
paired fasting glucose, to be associated
with increased mortality (2­4).
However, most of these studies are
based on fasting or postprandial glucose
(1­4), and few are based on GHb levels
(3,5­8). The GHb level may be a better
indicator of hyperglycemia because it
provides a measure of an individual's av-
erage glucose levels for the previous 3
months. Thus, it may provide a more sta-
ble snapshot of glucose levels when used
in prospective cohort studies to examine
the association of subsequent risk. Cur-
rently, GHb is monitored in the treatment
of diabetes, and GHb targets for preven-
tion of complications among individuals
with diabetes have been established (9).
Interest in the use of GHb for the diagno-
sis of diabetes is increasing (10), and an
international effort is underway to stan-
dardize the measurement of GHb (11).
This focus of GHb in clinical care mea-
sures (12) raises important questions
about the long-term predictability of
GHb.
Examination of the relationship of
GHb with mortality reveals several areas
of uncertainty, including whether the re-
lationship of GHb with mortality is simi-
lar among individuals with and without
diabetes from both prospective cohort
studies and clinical trials. A few prospec-
tive cohort studies have examined the as-
sociation of GHb with risk of mortality
(5­8) and shown an increased risk of
mortality with increasing GHb level. Only
two studies included individuals with di-
abetes, but these studies did not examine
GHb levels by diabetes status, and none
were representative of the general U.S.
population.
Recently published findings from
three clinical trials among adults with di-
abetes have added to this uncertainty. The
Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in
Diabetes (ACCORD) trial showed that
lower GHb levels increased risk of mor-
tality and did not decrease CVD events
(13). Whereas the Action in Diabetes and
Vascular Disease--Preterax and Diami-
cron Modified Release Controlled Evalu-
ation (ADVANCE) study showed that
lowering of GHb levels was associated
with a decrease in micro- and macrovas-
cular events and deaths from CVD (14)
and the Veterans Administration Diabetes
Trial reported that lower GHb levels were
not associated with a reduction in cardio-
vascular events (15). These findings have
not led to any changes in glycemic control
recommendations (16).
The Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III) is
the first nationally representative survey
to include a measure of GHb and has mor-
tality status available through linkage to
the National Death Index. The objective
of this study was to examine the associa-
tion of GHb with subsequent mortality in
a nationally representative sample of U.S.
adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- We analyzed data
among 20,024 adults aged 20 years
who were sampled as part of NHANES III.
NHANES III was conducted between
1988 and 1994 by the National Center for
Health Statistics. A stratified multistage

sample design was used to produce a na-
tionally representative sample of the non-
institutionalized U.S. civilian population
(17). The survey included a physical ex-
amination, laboratory tests, and question-
naires on health- and nutrition-related
topics. The overall response rate for
adults aged 20 years who completed the
interview and examination was 77% (18).
Main exposure
GHb was measured during the examina-
tion for all adults aged 20 years. GHb
measurements were standardized to the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
(17). We analyzed GHb levels as categor-
ical and continuous. For the categorical
analysis, GHb levels were classified as
6%, between 6 and 7%, between 7 and
8%, and 8%. These levels were selected
to correspond to the American Diabetes
Association treatment guidelines (9).
Other baseline assessments
Participants' age, sex, race/ethnicity, edu-
cation, and personal health characteristics
were obtained by interview. Smoking sta-
tus was categorized as current, past, or
never. Current smoking was defined as
self-reported smoking of at least 100 cig-
arettes during one's lifetime and currently
smoking cigarettes. Physical examination
included measuring waist circumference,
height, weight, and blood pressure and
drawing blood (17). BMI was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters for each partic-
ipant from the measured height and
weight. Systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure was obtained from the mean of three
to five blood pressure measurements. All
lipid and lipoprotein analyses were con-
ducted on venous blood serum samples
(17). For the present analysis, we chose
HDL cholesterol levels as an indicator of
cardiovascular risk; HDL is available for
all adults.
Previously diagnosed diabetes was
determined by self-report. Women who
reported diagnosis of diabetes only dur-
ing pregnancy were not considered to
have diagnosed diabetes.
Outcomes
NHANES III participants aged 17 years
who had data available for matching were
matched to the National Death Index
(NDI) to determine mortality status. The
NDI was searched through 31 December
2000 for follow-up. Linking of NHANES
III and the NDI is conducted by probabi-
listic matching. The National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted the
linkage and created scores for potential
matches. For a selected sample of
NHANES III records, NCHS reviewed the
death certificate record to verify correct
matches. Overall, there were 20,024 adult
NHANES III participants eligible for mor-
tality follow-up by linkage with NDI, of
whom 3,384 were assumed to be de-
ceased. A complete description of the
methodology used to link NHANES III
records to NDI is available (19). This
study is based on the restricted-use
NHANES III Linked Mortality File (20).
The underlying cause of death is
based on ICD-9 codes from 1986 to 1998
and on ICD-10 codes from 1999 to 2000.
Heart disease deaths were based on ICD-9
codes 390 ­398, 402, 404 ­ 429, and
ICD-10 codes I00­I09, I11, I13, I20­
I51. Cancer deaths were based on ICD-9
codes 140­208 and ICD-10 codes C00­
C097. Cause of death codes based on
ICD-9 and ICD-10 were selected for high
comparability between the two coding
methods (21).
For NHANES III participants with
complete data for all variables included in
the analysis (n  19,025), there were
15,967 participants assumed to be alive
and 3,058 assumed to be deceased.
Among those assumed to be deceased,
four participants were missing informa-
tion on cause of death. Overall, there were
3,058 deaths from all causes, 1,058
deaths from heart disease, and 701 deaths
from cancer during 159,879 person-years
of follow-up. Person-years of follow-up
was calculated for each participant based
on the end of follow-up minus the date of
examination in NHANES III.
Analysis
All analyses were weighted to the U.S.
population using SUDAAN statistical
software (version 9.1; RTI International,
Research Triangle Park, NC) to account
for the complex survey design and the
stratified multistage cluster sample and to
provide nationally representative esti-
mates (17,18). Demographic characteris-
tics, smoking status, body measurements,
blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, diabetes
status, and mean years of follow-up were
reported for participants at baseline by
GHb categories. Mortality per 1,000 per-
son-years was calculated for each GHb
category based on the weighted number
of deaths and person-years. A log-linear
Poisson model was used to calculate
95% CIs.
We constructed proportional hazards
models with GHb as both a categorical
variable and a continuous variable to de-
termine the relative hazard (RH) of mor-
tality associated with various levels of
GHb. We used age as the time scale for
analysis with left truncation. For cause-
specific analyses (i.e., cancer mortality or
cardiovascular mortality), a participant
was censored at the age of death he or she
died from a cause other than the specific
cause of death of interest. We report the
results for two proportional hazards mod-
els. The first was adjusted for sex and
race/ethnicity. The second was adjusted
for sex, race/ethnicity, education, smok-
ing status, BMI, systolic blood pressure,
and HDL cholesterol. There was a signif-
icant first-order interaction with GHb and
diagnosed diabetes (P  0.05) for all-
cause and heart disease mortality. The re-
sults are presented overall and stratified
by diagnosed diabetes status. There were
no other significant first-order multiplica-
tive interactions between GHb and the
other covariates (P  0.05).
To examine the association of GHb
levels as a continuous variable with mor-
tality, we graphed the relationship of GHb
and death using the proportional hazard
function to model GHb using a spline
regression with three knots (22). Spline
regression allows modeling of the rela-
tionship between GHb as a continuous
variable and mortality to be nonlinear
and allows examination of the function
relationship.
RESULTS
Baseline comparisons
Overall, adults with GHb levels 6%
were younger with a mean age of 45 years
compared with 60 years for adults with
GHb levels 6% (Table 1). Race/
ethnicity, education, smoking status, his-
tory of CVD, and diagnosed diabetes
differed by GHb levels. Adults with GHb
between 7 and 8% or 8% were also
more likely to have risk factors for CVD
including higher BMI, waist circumfer-
ence, and systolic blood pressure and
lower HDL cholesterol than adults with
GHb 6%.
Overall adult population
Adults with GHb between 7 and 8%
and those with GHb 8% had a higher
risk of all-cause mortality compared with
adults with GHb 6%, even after adjust-
ment for potential confounders (Table 2).

GHb level and risk of all-cause mortality
for all participants aged 20 years after
adjustment for potential confounders.
There seems to be a slight J-shaped rela-
tionship; however, there is no significant
increased risk of all-cause mortality until
GHb levels are 8%.
After adjustment for potential con-
founders, there was a threefold increased
risk for heart disease mortality among all
participants with GHb 8%, a 77% in-
creased risk among participants with
GHb between 7 and 8%, and a 66% in-
creased risk among participants with
GHb between 6 and 7% compared with
participants with GHb 6%.
After adjustment for potential con-
founders, there was a greater than twofold
risk for cancer mortality among adults
with GHb 8% and no increased risk
among participants with GHb between 7
and 8% or 6 and 7% compared with par-
ticipants with GHb 6%.
Population with diagnosed diabetes
Among adults with diagnosed diabetes,
after adjustment for potential confound-
ers, there was a 68% increased risk of all-
cause mortality for those with GHb 8%
compared with individuals with GHb
6% (Table 2). There was no significant
increased risk for adults with GHb be-
tween 7 and 8% or 6 and 7%. Figure 1B
presents the relationship of GHb level and
risk of all-cause mortality among adults
aged 20 years with diagnosed diabetes
after adjustment for potential confound-
ers. The relationship among adults with
diagnosed diabetes appears to be slightly
different compared with that for the over-
all population, with the risk of mortality
increasing to GHb 7% and then leveling
off, although the 95% confidence bands
include 1.0.
Adults with diagnosed diabetes and
GHb 8% had a greater than twofold in-
creased risk of heart disease mortality
compared with adults with GHb 6%.
The risk of heart disease mortality was not
significant for GHb categories of 6 to 7%
or 7 to 8% compared with GHb 6% af-
ter adjustment for potential confounders.
There was no significant association of
cancer mortality and GHb category
among adults with diagnosed diabetes.
Population without diagnosed
diabetes
Among adults without diagnosed diabe-
tes, there was no increased risk of all-
cause mortality with increased GHb level
(Table 2). Adults without diabetes and
with GHb between 6 and 7% or 7 and 8%
had higher mortality than those with GHb
8%, probably because of the small
number of participants in the highest
GHb category. The relationship of GHb
level and risk of all-cause mortality for
participants without diagnosed diabetes
is similar to that for the overall population
and appears to be a slight J-shaped rela-
tionship (data not shown). There was also
no increased risk for heart disease mortal-
ity or cancer mortality among adults with-
out diagnosed diabetes associated with
increasing GHb category.
CONCLUSIONS -- In this nationally
representative sample, among adults aged
20 years, increasing GHb levels were
associated with increased risk of all-cause
mortality, heart disease, and cancer mor-
tality. However, this association is medi-
ated by the presence of diagnosed
diabetes. Among adults with diagnosed
diabetes, GHb 8% was associated with a
70% increased risk from all-cause mortal-
ity and a 150% increased risk from heart
disease mortality. Among adults with di-
agnosed diabetes and GHb between 6 and
7% and 7 and 8%, there was no significant
increased risk of all-cause mortality.
However, there was a 90% increased risk

for heart disease mortality for adults with
diabetes and GHb between 6 and 7%.
There was no significant association of
GHb with mortality among adults with-
out diagnosed diabetes.
Previous studies that have examined
the association of hyperglycemia and
mortality using fasting glucose or post-
challenge glucose levels have also shown
an increased risk of mortality with in-
creasing glucose levels (2­4). Hypergly-
cemia is also associated with an increased
risk of incident CVD. A recent meta-
analysis of 38 reports of hyperglycemia
as a risk factor for CVD found an in-
creased risk of CVD for all measures of
hyperglycemia: fasting glucose, causal
glucose, postchallenge glucose, and GHb
level (1). Few of the studies included in
the meta-analysis were nationally repre-
sentative, and some studies did not take
diabetes status into account. GHb levels
themselves have also been associated with
an increased risk of incident disease in-
cluding CVD among individuals with di-
abetes (23) and colorectal cancer among
individuals with and without diabetes
(24).
However, there is limited evidence on
the association of GHb with mortality ei-
ther among the diabetic population (25)
or the general population (3,5­ 8).
Among the diabetic population, one

study showed that a 1% increase in GHb
level corresponded to an increased risk of
all-cause mortality, ischemic heart disease
mortality, and diabetes mortality after ad-
justment for other risk factors (25).
Among the nondiabetic population, the
results have been mixed (5­8), with one
study showing an increased risk among
women but not in men after adjustment
for potential confounders (8).
Most previous studies have either an-
alyzed GHb categorically or continu-
ously, but few have examined the shape of
the relationship of GHb with mortality
(5­8,25). Results presented from both
the spline regression and the categorical
analyses indicate that the association of
GHb levels with mortality among the
overall population and adults with diag-
nosed diabetes seems to differ. There
seems to be a slight J-shaped relationship
among the overall population, whereas
there is a possible threshold effect in the
diabetic population. This possible J-shape
relationship was also observed in a study
based in New Zealand (5). These authors
found that GHb levels 7 and 4% were
associated with increased mortality com-
pared with GHb levels of 4­5%, among
adults without a diagnosis of diabetes (5).
The American Diabetes Association
recommends GHb of 7% for most indi-
viduals with diabetes (9). These recom-
mendations are also promoted by the
National Diabetes Education Program
(26) and are based on evidence from ran-
domized clinical trials showing that
lowering GHb levels reduces diabetes mi-
crovascular complications (16) including
CVD (16). The benefit of glucose control
in preventing CVD in individuals with
type 2 diabetes is still uncertain. Recently,
three randomized clinical trials have ad-
dressed the question of whether lowering
glucose levels in individuals with type 2
diabetes, measured by GHb, to the levels
of adults without diabetes would reduce
morbidity and mortality from CVD. The
findings from these trials have, however,
added uncertainty to this question
(13,14), with two studies finding an in-
creased risk of mortality and one study
finding no increased risk (13,14). Our
findings suggest that after taking into ac-
count other well-established CVD risk
factors, lowering GHb 8% does not re-
sult in improvement in heart disease mor-

tality. In fact, among adults with diabetes,
there was an increased risk of heart dis-
ease mortality associated with GHb be-
tween 6 and 7%. Further studies are
needed to determine treatment strategies
for the prevention of CVD in individuals
with diabetes.
There are two main limitations of our
analysis. The first is that we had relatively
few deaths from certain causes and were,
therefore, unable to look at specific types
of cancer or other causes. Based on the
smaller sample size for the population
with diagnosed diabetes and the smaller
number of deaths from cancer, the study
may have been underpowered to detect a
significant increase in risk. The second
limitation is that GHb was only measured
at baseline, and we have no information
on how changes in GHb may or may not
have influenced a participant's risk of
mortality.
Nonetheless, this study also has a
number of strengths. First, NHANES III is
the first nationally representative survey
to measure GHb levels among adults and
the first study to provide nationally rep-
resentative estimates of the risk of mortal-
ity associated with GHb levels, and
second, there was relatively little loss to
follow-up for mortality.
In summary, we found that GHb of
8% was associated with a greater than
twofold increased risk of all-cause mortality
in the overall population and 60% in-
creased risk for all-cause mortality among
adults with diabetes. There was also a sig-
nificant increased risk of heart disease over-
all and for adults with diabetes.
