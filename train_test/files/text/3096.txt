Obesity has become a global epidemic, and it is still increasing
in both industrialized and developing countries.1 For example,
the prevalence of child obesity and overweight has doubled in
North America during the past two decades. At present, about
one-quarter of children in the US are obese or overweight.2
In Thailand, a transitional society, the prevalence of obesity
in schoolchildren has increased from 12% in 1991 to 16% in
1993.3 Due to the difficulty of curing obesity in adults and the
many long-term adverse effects of childhood obesity, the pre-
vention of child obesity has been recognized as a public health
priority.4 Increasing evidence shows that childhood obesity
has a profound influence on morbidity and mortality in adult
life.4­6 However, few studies have examined the worldwide
situation regarding childhood obesity, particularly due to the
fact that no standard or reference is agreed upon internation-
ally. Different definitions have been used in studies to define
childhood obesity.1,4,7,8 Recently a World Health Organization
(WHO) consultation on obesity concluded, `The current lack of
consistency and agreement between different studies over the
classification of obesity in children and adolescents makes it
difficult to give an overview of the global prevalence of obesity',
and an examination of obesity in children and adolescents
across the world based on a standardized obesity classification
system is urgently needed.1
The literature has another major gap because a large number
of studies on adults have examined the relationship between

obesity: the epidemic and the relationship
between obesity and socioeconomic status

Background Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic. Recently WHO acknowledged an urgent
need to examine child obesity across countries using a standardized international
standard. Studies in adults find obesity and socioeconomic factors (SES) factors
are correlated, but results are inconsistent for children. Using an international
standard, we examined the prevalence of obesity and compared the associations
between SES factors and obesity across countries.
Methods Data for children aged 6­18 from nationwide surveys in the US (NHANES III,
1988­1994), China (1993), and Russia (1992) were used. We used the recently
updated US NCHS body mass index (BMI = wt/ht2) reference to define obesity
(BMI 95th percentile) and overweight (85thBMI95th percentile). The WHO
recommends an early version of the NCHS reference for international use. We
conducted logistic analyses to examine the relationship between SES and obesity.
Results The prevalence of obesity and overweight was 11.1% and 14.3%, respectively, in
the US, 6.0% and 10.0% in Russia, and 3.6% and 3.4% in China. The relation-
ship between obesity and SES varied across countries. Higher SES subjects were
more likely to be obese in China and Russia, but in the US low-SES groups were
at a higher risk. Obesity was more prevalent in urban areas in China but in rural
areas in Russia.
Conclusions Child obesity is becoming a public health problem worldwide, but the prevalence
of obesity varies remarkably across countries with different socioeconomic develop-
ment levels. Different SES groups are at different risks, and the relationship between
obesity and SES varies across countries.

socioeconomic status (SES) factors and obesity, but less research
has used data representing large populations to examine the
effects of these relationships on children.9­12 Sobal and Stunkard
have provided an excellent review of this topic.11 After exam-
ining over 140 published studies, they concluded that these
studies reveal a strong inverse relationship between SES and
obesity among women in developed societies, but the relation-
ship is inconsistent for men and children. In contrast, in devel-
oping countries a strong relationship exists between SES and
obesity among men, women, and children. It is of concern,
however, that since different obesity definitions and SES
indicators were used, the findings in different studies may not
be comparable.
Moreover, it is argued that how SES and obesity are related
is not clear. Among adults it is likely that causality operates in
either direction.13­15 We expected that it may be easier to test
the direction of such a causality with studies among children
because usually the SES of children is determined by their
parents' characteristics instead of being influenced by their own
obesity status and the related social consequences. To our know-
ledge, limited efforts have been made to systemically examine
the relationships between childhood obesity and SES across
countries using large-scale survey data.
Our main objective is to examine the current cross-continental
situation of child and adolescent obesity and compare the
relationship between SES factors and obesity across countries
using an international obesity standard. We include industrial-
ized and developing countries from different continents and with
different socioeconomic development levels.16,17 Nationwide
survey data collected in the early 1990s from the US, China, and
Russia are used. The national total population was 1244 million
in China, 268 million in the US, and 147 million in Russia in the
early 1990s; and their total populations account for over a
quarter of the global population.18
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Children and adolescents aged 6­18 years who had complete
anthropometric and demographic data from national surveys in
each country were included. Pregnant girls were excluded. The
final sample size was 6110 for the US; 3028 for China; and 6883
for Russia.
Data sources
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III, 1988­1994)
The third NHANES was a cross-sectional representative sample
of the US civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 2
months. NHANES III contains data for a sample of 33 994 people,
and it oversampled blacks, Mexican Americans, children under
5 years, and the elderly (60 years). Detailed descriptions of
the sample design and operation of the survey have been pub-
lished elsewhere.19 Standardized protocols were used for all
interviews and examinations. Data on weight and height
were collected for each individual in the full mobile examin-
ation centre through direct physical examinations. Based on
self-reported race and ethnicity, subjects were classified into
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
and other four ethnic groups.
The China Health and Nutrition Surveys (CHNS, 1993)
The CHNS covered eight provinces that vary substantially in
geography, economic development, public resources, and health
indicators. Anthropometric measurements were carried out by
trained health workers, who followed standard protocol similar
to the US NHANES protocol developed by the US National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Weight was measured in
light indoor clothing to the nearest tenth of a kilogram with a
beam balance scale. Height was measured without shoes to
the nearest tenth of a centimetre using a portable stadiometer.
Detailed descriptions of the CHNS have been published else-
where.20 The 1993 data were used. The CHNS time frame matches
that of US NHANES III.
The Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS, 1992)
The RLMS is the first nationally representative household survey
in the Russian Federation. All members of more than 6400
households from all regions of Russia were surveyed eight times
from 1992 to 1998. Weight and height were measured to follow
a protocol similar to the ones used in the NHANES III and CHNS
surveys. Detailed descriptions of the RLMS have been published
elsewhere.21 The 1992 data were used for a better comparison
(i.e. similar survey year) with data from the US and China.
Measures
Definition of obesity and overweight
Adiposity was measured by using the body mass index (BMI =
weight [kg]/height [m]2). Following WHO's recommendation,
we used a series of sex-age-specific BMI cut-offs to define obesity
and overweight.22 It is important to choose a good obesity
standard for examining the global obesity epidemic and making
international comparisons.1,4,7,8 A WHO Expert Committee
recommends using a set of sex- and age-specific BMI percentiles,
developed by Must and others based on the US NHANES I data
collected in 1971­1975, to define adolescent obesity, overweight,
and underweight.22­24 Specifically the WHO recommends using
the BMI 85th percentile to define overweight and the 5th per-
centile for underweight. This reference is called the `WHO/
NCHS reference',22 and it has been widely used in the US and
other countries.4,8,25­29 Although the WHO Expert Committee
recommends using both the BMI 85th percentile and the triceps
skinfold thickness 90th percentile to define adolescent obesity,22
this has been used infrequently due to the difficulty of measur-
ing triceps skinfold thickness in large population-based studies
(e.g. our RLMS data). Instead, many have recommended the
use of the BMI 95th percentile to define child and adolescent
obesity.23,24,29,30
Most recently the US NCHS updated the old WHO/NCHS
reference by using new data and better statistical techniques,30
although the new BMI cut-offs are similar to the previous
ones. It is expected that this new reference will be accepted to
replace the old WHO/NCHS reference for international research.
Therefore we chose to use the new NCHS BMI cut-offs. The
sex-age-specific BMI 85th, and 95th percentiles were used to
define overweight, and obesity respectively. Also, because the
prevalence of obesity is very low in China, in our comparison
analysis we focused on overweight.
An alternative that we have considered is the recently
published `IOTF standard' proposed by the Childhood Obesity
Working Group of the International Obesity Task Force
(IOTF).7,31 Our previous analysis showed that in general the
1130 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
WHO/NCHS and IOTF references produced similar estimates
of overall overweight prevalence, although the differences are
noticeable for certain ages.32 In addition, recently some concerns
have been raised regarding the use of the IOTF standard, except
for its strengths.32,33 Our decision to use the WHO/NCHS
reference allows easier comparisons between our findings and
those of others who have used this reference.
Sociodemographic characteristics
Subjects were separated into two age groups: children (6­9
years) and adolescents (10­18 years). Self-reported urban-rural
residences were used. As a result the meanings of urban and
rural residences may vary across countries. Per capita family
income tertiles were used to indicate low, middle, and high SES.
Family income data were collected at the same time children's
BMI measurements were collected.
Statistical analysis
First, we examined the prevalence of overweight and under-
weight in each country by age group, sex, urban/rural residence,
and SES. For the US, to achieve national representative preval-
ence estimates, sampling weights were used to adjust for sample
design effects. Next, using logistic regression models, we examined
the associations between obesity and SES for each country.
Since the prevalence of obesity was low in China and Russia, we
combined obesity and overweight (i.e. BMI 85th percentile).
Furthermore, we examined the associations between BMI and
SES. For the US, in all regression analyses, sample design effects
were adjusted, and the effect of ethnicity was also examined. All
analyses were performed by using SAS Version 6.12 (SAS, Cary,
NC, USA) and Stata Version 6.0 (Stata Co., College Station, TX,
USA).
Results
Children and adolescents' main characteristics
and BMI distribution in each country
Each sample's main sociodemographic characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. On average American and Russian chil-
dren and adolescents were taller and heavier than their Chinese
counterparts. We also examined the distribution of BMI among
children and adolescents in each country (Figures 1 and 2). A
clear shift of increased BMI existed across the three countries.
The trends were more obvious among adolescents than among
children.
The prevalence of overweight and obesity across
countries
As shown by Figure 3, the overall prevalence of obesity and over-
weight was high in the US (combined prevalence was 25.4%),
low in China (combined prevalence, 7.0%), and moderate in
Russia (combined prevalence, 16.0%). These clearly suggest
that national socioeconomic development levels influence the
epidemic of obesity. The prevalence of obesity and overweight
and the combined prevalence of obesity and overweight by
age, sex, and SES groups are presented in Table 2. In the US,

the prevalence of obesity and overweight among American
adolescents was lowest in the high-income group. By contrast,
in China the high-income groups generally were at a higher risk
of obesity. The prevalence of obesity was higher in rural areas
in Russia but higher in urban areas in China. Interestingly, in
both Russia and China, but not in the US, the prevalence of
obesity and overweight was higher among children than among
adolescents. The differences were especially remarkable for
obesity.
Comparison of relationships between obesity
and SES across countries
Socioeconomic status was related to children's and adolescents'
risks of being obese or overweight (simply termed `obese'),
although the relationships were different across countries
(Table 3). In Russia urban children and adolescents were at a
lower risk of obesity, but in China urban children and adolescents
were at a higher risk. Compared to the medium-income group,
the low-income group was at a higher risk in both the US and
Russia, and in Russia the high-income group was also at an
increased risk. In China, however, high-income children and
adolescents were more likely to be obese. Moreover our analysis
stratified by gender indicates that in both China and Russia (but
not the US), boys and girls are at different risks even if they
have the same SES (Table 4). That is, gender is an effect modifier.34
Sobal and Stunkard suggested that research was needed to
examine whether the relationships change with age in children
and adolescents.11 We tested the relationship between SES
and obesity by age group (6­9 years and 10­18 years) for each
country, and then by each year of age for American children
and adolescents. We found that similar significant associations
between obesity and SES existed in both age groups in China
and Russia. By contrast, in the US only among adolescents (age
10 years) did we find a reverse relationship between SES (i.e.
income) and obesity. Low-income adolescents were at a higher
risk for obesity (OR = 1.4, 95% CI : 1.1­1.9), and high-income
adolescents were at a lower risk (OR = 0.7, 95% CI : 0.5­0.9).
The SES was not significantly related to obesity among children
under 10 years. The association became significant only among
adolescents at age 12, and it became insignificant at age 17.

Moreover, for the US consistent with many previous studies,
we found that ethnicity was a significant risk factor. Compared
to whites, blacks and Mexican American children and adolescents
were at a higher risk for obesity and overweight; OR were 1.2
(95% CI : 1.01­1.5) and 1.4 (95% CI : 1.1­1.9), respectively. Age
and gender were adjusted. However, when income and urban-
rural residence were adjusted, ethnicity became insignificant.
These may suggest that the SES differences across ethnic groups
are likely the main explanation for the difference in obesity preva-
lence across ethnic groups. We could not examine these ethnic/
subculture variations in China and Russia because minorities
only count for a small proportion of their total populations. In
both the Russia and China surveys, only a very small proportion
of the subjects are from minority ethnic groups. The small sample
sizes did not allow us to conduct meaningful comparisons.
Finally, we examined BMI as a continuous variable, stratified
by sex and age groups. In general, results (Table 5) were consistent
with the logistic regression analysis. High-income American
girls had lower BMI. In Russia urban girls had lower BMI,
but low- and high-income groups had higher BMI. In contrast,
in China urban boys had higher BMI. Also SES effects seemed
to vary by age groups. In the US, for example, although low-
income was not a significant risk factor for elevated BMI among
children under 10 years, it was a strong one among adolescents
(age 10 years). For the US we also examined the influence of
ethnicity. Interestingly, African-American girls and Mexican-
American girls were more likely to have a higher BMI than white
girls even when controlled for family income and urban/rural
residence (P  0.05). The regression coefficients and SES were
0.87 (0.27) and 0.84 (0.39), respectively. For males, however,
ethnicity was not a significant risk factor (P  0.05). In addition,
since the distribution of BMI in each sample was slightly skewed,
we repeated the regression analyses using natural logarithms
transformed BMI. The results we found were similar.
Discussion
The lack of consistent classifications in various studies makes
it difficult to assess the global situation of child and adolescent
obesity.1­8 To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to
examine child and adolescent obesity across countries using an
international standard and based on data from large nationwide
surveys. Overall we found that the prevalence of obesity differs
remarkably across countries with different socioeconomic
development levels. The combined prevalence of obesity and
overweight was high in the US (25%), moderate in Russia (16%),
and low in China (7%). Even though the use of different stand-
ards makes comparisons of findings difficult, previous studies
indicate that in many other developed countries child and adol-
escent obesity have reached levels comparable to those in the
US.1,35­37 In addition evidence suggests that the prevalence
of overweight has increased to relatively high levels in many
developing countries.1 For example, in Brazil the prevalence of
overweight among schoolchildren has tripled and increased
from 4% in the 1970s to 14% in late 1990s. In 1997, 17% of
children and 13% of adolescents were obese or overweight in
1997.38 In Egypt 14% of adolescents were overweight or obese
in 1997.25 Worthy of mention, there are still controversies
over the use of a series of universal BMI cut-offs to define
obesity or overweight in different populations of either adults or
children.22,32,33,39 For example, it was recently suggested that
different BMI cut-offs should be used for Asian and Caucasian
populations.33 Nevertheless, our results clearly show that child-
hood obesity is becoming a worldwide epidemic. The remark-
able variation in the prevalence across populations suggests that
social, economic, and environmental factors are important influ-
ences on the epidemic, although it maybe also true that genetic
differences across populations also play a role.5
Our analysis shows that child and adolescent obesity is related
to SES, although the relationships differ among these three

populations. We used family income as a primary indicator of
SES, while rural-urban residence might serve as an additional
indicator. In the US low SES groups had a higher risk of obesity.
By contrast, in China high SES groups were at an increased
risk. In Russia, a transitional society that has experienced eco-
nomic difficulties since the early 1990s,21,40 both low-income
and high-income groups were at an increased risk of obesity
compared to the medium-income group. One possible explan-
ation for the different SES-obesity relationship in developed
countries such as the US and developing countries such as
China is that the influence of SES on people's lifestyles such as
diet and physical activity may differ. Take food consumption
patterns as an example. In China richer people have better
access to meat and other energy-dense foods (which are much
more expensive than other foods such as vegetables) than the
poor.26 While in the US, higher-SES groups usually consume
more vegetables and fruits, which are less energy-dense, than
low-SES groups.41
Unlike China, where urban children were more likely to be
obese, in Russia urban groups were less likely to be obese than
were rural groups. In the US no consistent rural-urban difference
emerged. Similar to the results for China, the recent Egyptian
national survey found that the prevalence of overweight and
obesity was 22.6% among urban adolescents versus 10.4%
among rural adolescents.25 These patterns are particularly
attributable to the differences in people's access to food and
health services, physical activity patterns, and social norms in
rural and urban areas in these countries. Compared to their
rural counterparts, urban Chinese usually have higher family
income, better access to food (especially meat and poultry),
public services such as health care and transportation. They are
also more likely to have sedentary lifestyles.26,42 In contrast, US
rural and urban children and adolescents have similar access
to food choices thanks to the well-established food production
and distribution system. They are also likely to have similar
lifestyles.43 In Russia, urban groups were less likely to be obese
than rural groups. This is probably due to that in the past
decade, living standards of urban groups have been seriously
affected by the socioeconomic difficulties occurring since the
collapse of the former Soviet Union.16,17,21,40 Furthermore,
our analysis stratified by sex and age further indicate that social,
economic, and environmental factors may operate through
complex pathways to influence childhood obesity.
In general our findings regarding the relationships between
obesity and SES are consistent with findings from many
previous studies.10,11,25,44 For example, among the 32 studies
conducted on girls from developed societies reviewed by Sobal
and Stunkard,11 40% found a inverse relationship between SES
and obesity, although 25% found a positive relationship and
35% found no relationship. The results were similar for boys.
The majority of the 16 studies conducted among children from
developing societies indicate a clear positive relationship.11
Most recently McMurray and others also found that low SES
influenced adolescents' body weight status in the US.44 EI-
Tawila and others found that in Egypt the prevalence of obesity
among high SES adolescents was more than double that among
low SES groups (7.0% versus 3.1%).25
Another interesting finding is that in both Russia and China
but not in the US the prevalence of obesity and overweight was
higher among children than among adolescents. The differences
were especially remarkable regarding obesity. Further research
is needed to investigate whether the gap is due to the differ-
ences in children's and adolescents' social and behavioral factors,
such as diet and physical activity, or if it is because of the
WHO/NCHS standard, which is based on data from the US. For
example, it has been well documented that thinness is desired
in many developed societies, such as the US, and dieting is
popular among young American females.45,46 However, `the
biological picture is not accurately reflected in American popular
culture'.46 In other words, the growth patterns of American
children and adolescents are not necessarily the optimal patterns
for other populations. Furthermore, ample evidence suggests
that sexual maturation is related to being fat, and adolescents in
many developing countries mature later than their American
counterparts.22,47 Therefore we suspect that by using the WHO/
NCHS standard we might have underestimated the obesity
problem among adolescents in China and Russia.
Our study has several limitations. Although the NHANES III
and the RLMS samples are nationally representative, the CHNS
sample is not. Only 8 of China's 31 provinces are covered. China
is a country with large heterogenities.26,42 The CHNS sample
can not reflex the whole situation in China. Since the CHNS
study, however, was designed to monitor nationwide trends,
provinces of different geography, economic development, public
resources, and health indicators have been included. And, in
each province, communities of different SES levels were sampled.
Thanks to the close collaboration from local health officials
and nutritionist, plus the support of participants, the non-
participation rate was very low whenever the subjects were
identified and invited to participate in the 1993 survey. Hence,
we are confident that the CHNS sample can provide good
insights into the SES and obesity relationship in China. In
addition, a common weakness of the data sets we used is that
information about children and their care-providers' attitudes
and values toward obesity and children's physical activity patterns
(except for the US sample) were not collected. As a result, we
could not make a further investigation about how SES may
influence obesity nor to make more comprehensive comparisons
among the three countries. Finally, this is a cross-sectional study.
We could not prove any causal relationship.34 Nevertheless,
our findings provide some important insights into the child and
adolescent obesity problem.
In conclusion, obesity is becoming a public health problem
influencing children and adolescents in both developed and
developing countries. The prevalence of obesity varied remark-
ably across countries with difference socioeconomic development
levels, while within a certain population different SES groups
are at different risks. To effectively fight the global obesity epi-
demic, population-based social and environmental approaches
should be considered.

CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS 1135
KEY MESSAGES
· Using an international standard, we studied childhood obesity and the associations between socioeconomic status
(SES) factors and obesity in the US, Russia and China.
· The prevalence of obesity (including overweight) varies remarkably across the three countries of different
socioeconomic development levels: 25% in the US, 16% in Russia, and 7% in China.
· Different SES groups are at different risks, and the relationship between obesity and SES varies across countries.
The biomedical roots of epidemiology lead most epidemiologists
to examine individuals as units of analysis, typically in one
population and one place, and to interpret their findings using
physiological explanations. However, comparative epidemiology
is increasingly contrasting the prevalence and patterns of
various conditions in different places, and social epidemiology is
employing social science interpretations of research findings.
Like many other fields, epidemiologists are paying close
attention to the rise in the prevalence of obesity in all parts of
the world in what has been labelled the `obesity epidemic'.1,2
Much epidemiological research has examined high levels of
adult obesity, and now more analysts are studying children's
body weights to seek the precursors of overweight adults and
examine future adult cohorts.
Research by Wang3 in this issue of the International Journal
of Epidemiology advances current knowledge about obesity in
children by applying standardized consensus-based measures
of body weight to relatively recent cross-sectional samples in
three large nations: China, Russia, and the US. Comparative
cross-national research designs4 may provide useful insights
about processes involved in the changing prevalence of health
conditions such as body weight. Wang3 found obesity and over-
weight were relatively common in US children while under-
weight was rare, the reverse was true of China, and Russia stood
between the other two nations. Wang3 also identified important
variations in overweight and underweight by socioeconomic
status and rural-urban residence, which suggested additional
complexities in the processes underlying body weight differ-
ences between the three nations. Wang's3 research opens the
door for epidemiologists to incorporate the concept of global-
ization into the field.
Cross-national data can be interpreted in several ways,
including as evidence of globalization.4 Epidemiologists have
typically considered national differences in health and illness as
site-specific cases or as examples of a progressive modernization
process that nations proceed through at different rates. Rather
than considering each nation as a separate unit of analysis,
however, an alternative is to consider the world as a global unit
where overarching institutions and processes operate. Such
global thinking has emerged as an important framework in
the social sciences,5 and it would be fruitful for epidemiologists
to incorporate globalization into their conceptualizations and
analyses. Little global thinking is currently evident in epidemiology,
with some exceptions in considering globalism in occupational
health, infectious disease, and nutrition.6

Commentary: Globalization and the
epidemiology of obesity

Globalization is the process of worldwide integration and uni-
fication of previously local, national, and regional phenomena
into global units. Globalization involves more than internation-
alization or cross-national, cross-cultural, or cross-population
linkages. Achievement of globality makes nations components
of a common global whole rather than separate units of analysis
to be compared independently. Global governments, global cor-
porations, global media, global food systems, and global diseases
become the new units of analysis rather than separate national,
local, or individual cases. To the extent that obesity represents
a worldwide epidemic, it constitutes a global pandemic rather
than a set of independent occurrences in various nations. The
crucial point in thinking about globality is that global conditions
have underlying global causes and also require global interventions.
Global increases in the incidence and prevalence of obesity
are grounded in the globalization of Western post-industrial food
systems and consumer culture that has increasingly penetrated
all societies of the world.5,7 Understanding the global epi-
demiology of obesity requires analysis of the global institutions
that modify caloric intake and energy expenditure. Global
corporations are establishing industrialized agro-food systems
in almost all nations that will provide constant 24 hours a day/
7 days a week/365 days a year consumer access to virtually
unlimited volumes of relatively inexpensive calorifically dense
foods to all people in all places at all times through supermarket,
catering, vending, takeout, home delivered, drive through, and
fast/snack foods.8,9 Other global processes provide increasingly
universal and relatively inexpensive transportation, communi-
cation, and other activity-sparing systems through automobiles,
television, and energy-saving components of the built environ-
ment that minimize physical activity levels for a growing pro-
portion of people worldwide.8,9 Global food systems and global
vehicles, appliances, and mass media are the underlying causes
of increases in global obesity.6,9
To fully understand the globalization of obesity, epidemio-
logists need to move beyond biology and beyond behaviours
to examine collective social, economic, and political structures
and cultural changes rather than focusing only on individual
physiology and personal characteristics. Global values, cor-
porations, and politics transform the material conditions of
life so that children and adults eat more and are less active,
leading to global increases in obesity. Including questions on
national surveys that ask about processed food consumption
and television viewing can provide insights into the underlying
processes in the globalization of obesity better than additional
batteries of standard demographic and health questions. Inves-
tigation of globalization may also employ multi-level contextual
analyses, examining neighbourhood or national fast food
franchises and obesity levels or analysing television access in
communities and mean body weights.
Some nations such as the US are almost completely globalized
in their food and activity patterns for all social strata. Other
countries like Russia and China are currently less than fully
globalized, where higher socioeconomic status individuals have
become incorporated into global systems and are becoming
obese while lower socioeconomic status individuals remain local-
ized and experience undernutrition. Rural-urban differences in
obesity are small in the US,3,10 where globalization approaches
universal penetration, while they remain large in countries
such as China and Russia where rural locations have not been
as completely drawn in to global systems. Children and adol-
escents tend to participate in global culture more quickly than
their parents, and therefore young cohorts bear watching for
their involvement in global institutions that will shape their
eating and activity levels and consequently their body weights.
The biomedical basis of epidemiology has led the field to
focus on comparisons of individuals and populations, rather
than units more appropriate to analysis of globalization such
as markets or cultures. The usefulness of epidemiological data is
contingent upon providing information about appropriate units.
Obesity interventions sometimes include local and national
policy changes,2,6 but global rather than community and federal
public health measures are needed to adequately deal with the
globalization of obesity.
