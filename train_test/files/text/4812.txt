Technology Confers Higher Complications
and Costs Before Effectiveness Proven: A

Abstract
A new breast cancer treatment, brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast radiotherapy (RT), was adopted before
long-term effectiveness evidence, potentially increasing morbidity and costs compared with whole breast RT. The aim of
this study was to estimate complication rates and RT-specific and 1-year costs for a cohort of female Medicare beneficiaries
diagnosed with breast cancer (N = 47 969). We analyzed 2005-2007 Medicare claims using multivariable logistic regression
for complications and generalized linear models (log link, gamma distribution) for costs. Overall, 11% (n = 5296) underwent
brachytherapy-based RT; 9.4% had complications. Odds of any complication were higher (odds ratio [OR]: 1.62; 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 1.49-1.76) for brachytherapy versus whole breast RT, similarly to seroma (OR: 2.85; 95% CI: 1.97-
4.13), wound complication/infection (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.52-1.95), cellulitis (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.27-1.73), and necrosis (OR:
2.07; 95% CI: 1.55-2.75). Mean RT-specific and 1-year total costs for whole breast RT were $6375, and $19 917, $4886, and
$4803 lower than brachytherapy (P < .0001). Multivariable analyses indicated brachytherapy yielded 76% higher RT costs
(risk ratio: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.74-1.78, P < .0001) compared with whole breast RT. Brachytherapy had higher complications and
costs before long-term evidence proved its effectiveness. Policies should require treatment registries with reimbursement
incentives to capture surveillance data for new technologies.

Background
Use of new medical technology may inadvertently increase
costs of care or morbidity while diffusing into practice without
long-term effectiveness evidence.1,2 This case study of the
introduction of a new radiotherapy (RT) modality explores the
impact of early implementation. Instead of a standard treat-
ment for early invasive breast cancer that includes lumpec-
tomy with 4 to 7 weeks of whole breast RT,3,4 evidence
suggested that a new RT paradigm requiring twice-daily treat-
ment over 5 days could be effective by targeting only the
tumor cavity and immediate surrounding area rather than the
whole breast;5,6 this new RT was called accelerated partial
breast RT. It utilizes more efficiently focused RT to the tumor
bed, where most ipsilateral breast recurrences occur; it also
reduces the time burden and inconvenience of whole breast RT
by requiring fewer treatments over a shorter time period,3,4,7,8
and it may minimize acute side effects such as fibrosis, asym-
metry, skin burns, and chronic side effects such as cardiac tox-
icity, pulmonary fibrosis, and rare secondary malignancies.9,10
However, published guidelines suggested that accelerated
partial breast RT should be used on highly selected patients,
those with smaller tumors, negative lymph nodes, and low
probability of recurrence.11,12 Balloon brachytherapy­based
accelerated partial breast RT for early breast cancer is an
example of a technology with early uptake prior to published
long-term effectiveness evidence.1,13-16 The treatment requires
the invasive surgical implantation of a balloon-like device into
the tumor bed after lumpectomy, making the patient suscepti-
ble to infection. A high-dose seed of radiation is inserted
through a catheter into the balloon-like device twice daily for
5 days. Early follow-up data indicated low local recurrence
rates and good cosmetic outcomes,7,10,17 but longer follow-up

data were not available when physicians started adopting the
technology in the 2000s.7,17-23
Prior to publication of results of randomized studies with
long-term follow-up, we sought to estimate the costs and compli-
cations comparing whole breast RTwith balloon brachytherapy­
based accelerated partial breast RT in Medicare beneficiaries to
evaluate whether there were changes in RTcosts or morbidity for
women with early breast cancer. Previous work estimating com-
plication rates included all patients receiving balloon brachyther-
apy in large cohorts of Medicare beneficiaries,24,25 and used
analytic methods to try to account for selection into treatment.
We studied a more homogenous patient cohort with the least
extensive invasive breast cancer, to estimate relevant complica-
tion rates in a more guideline-appropriate cohort.
Data and Methods
We analyzed physician, inpatient, and outpatient Medicare fee-
for-service claims data from the 2004-2008 Chronic Condition
Data Warehouse (CCW) for women aged 66 years and
older with at least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis
codes for breast cancer (174.X)26 and who underwent breast-
conserving surgery. We included women with continuous cov-
erage by Medicare Parts A and B and who were not in a health
maintenance organization (HMO) during the observation
period to ensure we had full claims to assess treatment and pre-
existing comorbidities. To select patients who had earlier stage
disease and would be more likely concordant with professional
society selection criteria, we excluded those who had more
extensive treatment, assuming they had more advanced breast
cancer, because we did not have explicit stage information in
claims data. Therefore, we excluded those who received mas-
tectomy, chemotherapy, or an axillary lymph node dissection
after a sentinel lymph node biopsy prior to RT. We categorized
RT type using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes
similar to previous work,1 using CPT/Healthcare Common
Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes appropriate to dis-
tinguish between brachytherapy-based accelerated partial
breast RT and whole breast RT within 16 weeks of surgery for
whole breast RT and within 12 weeks following surgery for
brachytherapy (Table 1).At the end of RT, the follow-up period

began, and we identified complications including any compli-
cation (i.e., 1 or more), infection or wound complication,
seroma, breast fibrosis, fat necrosis, cellulitis, breast pain, and
additional hospitalization within 1 year of the end of RT. Patient
age and race were taken from the Medicare eligibility file. We
linked US Census tract data for information on rural residence
and high poverty (>20%), and calculated the Klabunde comor-
bidity index27 for each subject. Our final cohort had 47 969
beneficiaries undergoing RT after breast-conserving surgery
from 2005 to 2007, allowing us to calculate preexisting comor-
bidity burden and have 1 year of follow-up that started at the
end of radiation treatment. High poverty was not significant
and was removed from our models. This study was approved
by the lead author's institutional review board.
Complications Analysis
We conducted chi-square tests of differences in complication
rates by RT modality. Next, to evaluate the odds of a patient
having a complication associated with RT, we estimated a
multivariable logistic model for the odds of any complica-
tion and for the odds of each complication type separately.
We conducted Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests for
each model. This chi-square test was not significant in any
models, indicating no evidence of poor fit. Out of concern
for selection into treatment (i.e., endogeneity bias, or con-
founding by indication), we explored using a bivariate probit
model analogous to instrumental variables analysis28-30 and
found our point estimates of complications were nearly iden-
tical to the nonsimple model results. For ease of interpreta-
tion, therefore, we present the logistic regression results.
Cost Analyses
We separately calculated mean RT-specific and 1-year total
costs for combined inpatient, outpatient, and physician ser-
vices, adjusting for inflation using the consumer price index,
comparing mean costs by treatment type using a t test,
because mean costs are easily interpreted and typically used
as inputs for cost-effectiveness analyses. We also calculated
mean cost confidence intervals (CIs). We then estimated
multivariable generalized linear models with a log link and
gamma distribution to explore factors associated with costs.
In multivariable analyses, we accounted for whether a sub-
ject had 1 or more RT complications (e.g., infection or wound
complication, seroma, fibrosis), race, rural residence, age,
and comorbidity index. The coefficients are exponentiated
and presented as rate ratios, indicating the relative expendi-
tures with and without the covariate effect, or the percentage
increase or decrease in costs associated with each covariate.
Finally, we estimated the economic burden to Medicare for
reimbursing brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast
RT instead of standard whole breast RT in advance of pub-
lished long-term evidence. All costs are represented as 2008
US$. We conducted sensitivity analyses on all multivariable
models to evaluate whether death during follow-up affecting
<2% of patients had an impact on model results.
Results
Nearly 11% (n = 5296) of the cohort underwent brachyther-
apy-based accelerated RT (Table 2). The sample was mostly
white (91%), aged 70 to 79 (54%), predominantly nonrural,
mostly lived within 10 miles of a brachytherapy provider,
and on average had few comorbidities. Of 47 969 women in
the cohort, 4510 (9.4%) had at least 1 complication, with
13.6% of brachytherapy patients and 8.9% of whole breast
RT patients having at least 1 complication (P < .0001 in
unadjusted analysis; Table 2). Individual complications
varied by brachytherapy receipt in univariate analyses, with
infection/wound complication (n = 1894), seroma (n =
150), breast pain (n = 1558), cellulitis (n = 1298), and
necrosis (n = 298) varying by RT type. Receipt of brachy-
therapy was statistically different by race, ruralness of resi-
dence, and distance to nearest brachytherapy provider
(Table 2).
Multivariable analysis of complication rates showed
that the odds of experiencing any complication in the year
after RT were 1.62 times higher (95% CI: 1.49-1.76) for
brachytherapy compared with whole breast RT (Table 3).
Seroma was much rarer (0.3% of patients overall) though
occurred 2.85 times more in brachytherapy patients (95%
CI: 1.97-4.13) than in whole breast RT patients. Wound
complication/infection, breast pain, cellulitis, and necrosis
also had higher odds of occurrence following brachyther-
apy compared with whole breast RT. Odds of burn, hospi-
talization, and fibrosis were not statistically significantly
different by RT modality. (Supplementary Table expands
Table 3 to show all covariates.)
Mean radiation-specific costs were $6375 (95% CI:
$6350-$6400) for whole breast RT, compared with $11 261
(95% CI: $11 137-$11 385) for brachytherapy-based RT,
yielding a statistically significant difference of $4886 (P <
.0001; Table 4). One-year total mean costs were $19 917
(95% CI: $19 763-$20 070) for whole breast RT, compared
with $24 720 (95% CI: $24 317-$25 124) for brachytherapy-
based RT, again a statistically significant difference of $4803
(P < .0001). In multivariable analyses, brachytherapy was
associated with 76% higher RT costs (risk ratio: 1.76, 95%
CI: 1.74-1.78, P < .0001) and 23% higher 1-year costs on
average, compared with whole breast RT (risk ratio: 1.23,
95% CI: 1.20-1.25, P < .0001; Table 5). One-year costs were
twice as high for women with the highest comorbidity bur-
den (P < .0001). Sensitivity analysis results are qualitatively
the same and show a lack of "death bias," likely because so
few died in the year (889 of 47 969; 1.85%).The incremental
treatment-specific cost of early adoption of brachytherapy-
based accelerated partial breast RT instead of using standard
whole breast RT was approximately $4.9 million per 1000
women.

Discussion
This study showed that the odds of infection and wound com-
plication, seroma, breast pain, necrosis, and cellulitis were
higher in balloon brachytherapy patients, and no complica-
tions were statistically more likely following whole breast RT.
Furthermore, the treatment cost analysis showed that balloon
brachytherapy was associated with 77% higher treatment costs
compared with standard whole breast RT. Yet in this early time
period, balloon brachytherapy­based accelerated partial breast
RT diffused throughout clinical care in the United States1 with
limited wide-scale assessment of complications or costs

associated with its use compared with standard whole breast
RT. Based on our estimates, Medicare spent an additional
$28.8 million on brachytherapy-based accelerated partial
breast RT treatment for our cohort alone, beyond what stan-
dard whole breast RT would have cost (ie, $4886*5898). This
new radiation treatment modality increased treatment-related
complications and health care costs before long-term evidence
proved its effectiveness.
Compared with other work in this area, we honed in on a
focused patient cohort, one that would be more likely recom-
mended for brachytherapy-based RT based on professional
society guidelines, because patients receiving, for example,
chemotherapy, had more advanced cancer and may have
been at differential risk for complications. Our cohort of
nearly 48 000 Medicare beneficiaries that was tailored to be
as homogenous as possible with regard to disease stage saw
much lower rates of complications by RT modality compared
with other studies.24,25 Other investigators have found much
higher absolute rates of infectious and noninfectious compli-
cations compared with our results.24,25 This could be due to
their broader sample selection that included all use of brachy-
therapy RT. We also note that we were comparing complica-
tions of a new therapy during a steep learning curve phase
with a tried-and-true practice in effect for nearly 30 years,
and absolute rates of complications likely will decrease fur-
ther over time. Others' analysis of comparable data from
2008 to 2010 showed some improvements in patient selec-
tion over time, which might represent physicians learning
about optimal selection and could improve short- and long-
term outcomes.31
Many complications were identifiable in Medicare claims
data, although complications requiring an intervention or
procedure were more likely to be found. Minor complica-
tions that can be handled with routine follow-up typically are
not billed, and therefore, they will not be apparent in claims
data. However, complications requiring additional treatment
or diagnostic testing, such as re-excision, intravenous antibi-
otics, or hospitalization, should be more easily identifiable
within 1 year of RT. We did not have information about the
use of antibiotics before, during, or after treatment, however.
Due to the 1-year follow-up period, we excluded other long-
term complications such as pericarditis and pulmonary fibro-
sis, which could be associated differentially with different
forms of RT but are hard to measure and extremely rare in 1
year of follow-up. It is possible that brachytherapy-based
accelerated partial breast RT reduces long-term side effects
to heart and lung, while increasing short-term side effects
that are measured in this study. In general, using claims data
and limiting follow-up time may underestimate the number
of complications. Furthermore, fully informed patients may
have chosen treatment convenience and the risk of a short-
term infection or seroma, which are correctable, over a

longer treatment course and potential longer term risks of
cardiovascular disease or lung fibrosis, which are permanent.
In addition, all forms of accelerated partial breast RT will
offer patients a second chance at breast RT should they expe-
rience a second cancer or recurrence.
Our large, population-based study of older women with
early invasive breast cancer indicated that rates of several
specific complications were higher in the year following bal-
loon brachytherapy­based accelerated partial breast RT
compared with traditional whole breast RT, although hospi-
talization, burn, and fibrosis were not significantly different
from each other by RT modality. A more recent study com-
paring 2-year complication rates across many types of breast
RT in a Medicare sample appears to show overall complica-
tions slightly decreasing over time (2005-2011), although
annual estimates were not published;32 this may reflect
improved patient selection and physician experience with the
new technology over time. With some complications being
extremely rare, smaller registries or single-institution studies
simply cannot robustly estimate complication risks. Our
results showed lower absolute predicted rates of complica-
tions in a more homogenous cohort than other early
studies.24,25
Medicare covered broad use of this technology before
long-term evidence of its effectiveness was shown, yielding a
tremendous cost. We know that nonclinical factors partially
influenced the use of this new technology.1,33 For example,
brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast RT comes with
explicit financial incentives for surgeons to become involved
in radiation treatment, because they receive a device implanta-
tion fee, which does not happen with traditional whole breast
RT, and they may also have pressures from colleagues or
patients to use new treatments.1,33 Furthermore, there was no
consensus about technology adoption from the medical com-
munity,33 making it difficult to have a "coordinated approach
to evidence generation."34 It would have been prudent for the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to develop addi-
tional RT treatment registries to gather sufficient evidence of
effectiveness prior to widespread, open dissemination, as well
as tie reimbursement to clinical data collection. This example

highlights the need for creating appropriate financial payment
models to encourage data collection for evaluation of new
treatment modalities, both during the early phase of adoption
where there may be steep learning curves for patient selection
and technology or treatment application and as the treatment
diffuses and experience matures.
