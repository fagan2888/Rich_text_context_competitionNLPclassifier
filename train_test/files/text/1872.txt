THE UNITED STATES HAS A CON-
siderably greater expenditure
on medical care (US $5274 per
capita) than in the United
Kingdom (US $2164 adjusting for pur-
chasing power).1 To determine whether
that expenditure translates into better
health outcomes for the adult US popu-
lation, data on the degree of morbidity
in each country beyond the childhood
years are needed.
Given the strong link between so-
cioeconomic position and health in
both countries, cross-country compari-
sons of morbidity should examine varia-
tion of morbidity according to compa-
rable measures of socioeconomic
position. Cross-country comparison of
social differences in illness provides
some insight into potential causal ex-
planations. Access to health care is a
particular case in point. Although pub-
licly funded health care is available in
both countries to citizens older than 65
years, the UK National Health Service
has no age criterion for eligibility. Thus,
British households are more isolated
from any financial impacts of out-of-
pocket medical expenses. A similar ar-
gument applies to earnings and job
losses, for which the more generous UK
income maintenance system should
mitigate any effects of health changes
on income and wealth there com-
pared with what is available in the
United States.
We compare measures of morbidity
according to 2 salient measures of so-
cioeconomic status (SES)--education
and household income--in nationally
representative samples in the United
States and England. One common prob-

Context The United States spends considerably more money on health care than the
United Kingdom, but whether that translates to better health outcomes is unknown.
Objective To assess the relative heath status of older individuals in England and the
United States, especially how their health status varies by important indicators of so-
cioeconomic position.
Design, Setting, and Participants We analyzed representative samples of resi-
dents aged 55 to 64 years from both countries using 2002 data from the US Health
and Retirement Survey (n=4386) and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (n=3681),
which were designed to have directly comparable measures of health, income, and
education. This analysis is supplemented by samples of those aged 40 to 70 years from
the 1999-2002 waves of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n=2097)
and the 2003 wave of the Health Survey for England (n=5526). These surveys con-
tain extensive and comparable biological disease markers on respondents, which are
used to determine whether differential propensities to report illness can explain these
health differences. To ensure that health differences are not solely due to health is-
sues in the black or Latino populations in the United States, the analysis is limited to
non-Hispanic whites in both countries.
Main Outcome Measure Self-reported prevalence rates of several chronic dis-
eases related to diabetes and heart disease, adjusted for age and health behavior risk
factors, were compared between the 2 countries and across education and income
classes within each country.
Results The US population in late middle age is less healthy than the equivalent Brit-
ish population for diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke,
lung disease, and cancer. Within each country, there exists a pronounced negative so-
cioeconomic status (SES) gradient with self-reported disease so that health disparities
are largest at the bottom of the education or income variants of the SES hierarchy. This
conclusion is generally robust to control for a standard set of behavioral risk factors, in-
cluding smoking, overweight, obesity, and alcohol drinking, which explain very little of
these health differences. These differences between countries or across SES groups within
each country are not due to biases in self-reported disease because biological markers
of disease exhibit exactly the same patterns. To illustrate, among those aged 55 to 64
years, diabetes prevalence is twice as high in the United States and only one fifth of this
difference can be explained by a common set of risk factors. Similarly, among middle-
aged adults, mean levels of C-reactive protein are 20% higher in the United States com-
pared with England and mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are 14% lower.
These differences are not solely driven by the bottom of the SES distribution. In many
diseases, the top of the SES distribution is less healthy in the United States as well.
Conclusion Based on self-reported illnesses and biological markers of disease, US
residents are much less healthy than their English counterparts and these differences
exist at all points of the SES distribution.

lem with attempting international
analysis is the need to use self-
reported morbidity measures and that
might result in international differ-
ences simply due to reporting or diag-
nosis differences across countries. This
study combines self-reported data with
biological data that suffer less from such
ambiguities.
METHODS
Data
Despite the analytical advantages of
making international health compari-
sons, until recently good micro data
measuring both SES and health in com-
parable ways have not been available for
both countries. Fortunately, that prob-
lem has been remedied with the field-
ing of 4 surveys--each designed to have
comparable measures of SES and
self-reported and biological health
outcomes.
For the United States, our study is
basedontheHealthandRetirementSur-
vey (HRS), a nationally representative
surveythatcurrentlyincludesmorethan
20000 individuals in the older-than-50-
years populations.2 The HRS began in
1991 and new cohorts have been added
subsequently to maintain population
representation of this age segment and
respondents are reinterviewed biannu-
ally. To be comparable with the En-
glish survey fielded in the same year, we
use the 2002 wave of HRS.
Because biological measures are un-
available in HRS, we use the most re-
cent National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES), fielded
between 1999 and 2002.3 NHANES
contains data obtained through per-
sonal interviews, physical and labora-
tory examinations (blood, urine, and
swabs) for individuals aged 2 months
and older. NHANES 1999-2002 con-
tains 21004 interviews with medical ex-
aminations on 19 759 respondents. To
ensure that any differences between
countries that emerge are not due to
special issues that exist in the black or
Hispanic communities in the United
States or the Asian and black immi-
grant communities in England, all data
in our study are restricted to non-
Hispanic whites. Ethnicity was self-
reported by the participants in each of
the 4 studies.
For England, we use the English Lon-
gitudinal Survey of Aging (ELSA),
which contains approximately 12 000
respondents recruited from 3 separate
years of the Health Survey for En-
gland (HSE) survey providing a repre-
sentative sample of the English popu-
lation aged 50 years and older.4 The
health data were supplemented by col-
lection of social and economic data in
the first ELSA wave fielded in 2002.
Like HRS, follow-ups are every 2 years.
The authors of this article were in-
volved in the design and creation of
HRS and ELSA, and we only selected
key health and SES constructs where
strong a priori comparability existed in
measurement. The institutional re-
view board of RAND approved our re-
search project.
Biological measures for England were
obtained from the 2003 HSE, which
contains 18553 respondents of all ages.5
The survey protocols included an in-
terview visit followed by a nurse visit
who collected saliva and blood samples.
The blood samples were analyzed for
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C), fibrinogen, C-reactive pro-
tein, and glycosylated hemoglobin;
measures also available in NHANES.
Measures of SES
All4surveysarecomparableintheirSES
measurement with each containing in-
dividual attributes such as age, sex, race,
ethnicity, household income, and edu-
cation. The quality of the SES baseline
data are high.3 Two key SES measures
used are years of schooling and house-
holdincome,eachdividedinto3groups.
In the United States, education is sepa-
rated into high school or less (0-12
years), more than high school but not a
college graduate (13-15 years of school-
ing), and college or more (16 years).
In the United Kingdom the 3-way edu-
cationdivisionisqualifiedtoalevellower
than "O-level" or equivalent (typically
0-11 years of schooling), qualified to a
level lower than "A-level" or equivalent
(typically 12-13 years of schooling), and
a higher qualification (typically 13
years of schooling). In both countries,
family income (adjusted for household
size) is divided into 3 equally sized in-
come tertiles so that one third of the
population is in each group.
To eliminate the obvious effects of
age on health, our HRS-ELSA compara-
tive analysis is limited to those aged
55-64 years. Sample sizes were 4386 for
HRS and 3681 for ELSA. To provide ad-
equate sample size, our NHANES-HSE
comparisons are carried out on respon-
dents between the ages of 40 and 70
years. Sample sizes were 2097 for
NHANES and 5526 for HSE.
Self-reported Measures of
Health Outcomes and Risk Factors
All 4 surveys collect data on indi-
vidual self-reports of specific diseases
of the general form: "Did a doctor ever
tell you that you had . . . ?" The spe-
cific diseases we analyzed are diabe-
tes, hypertension, heart disease, myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, chronic lung
diseases, and cancer. The HRS and
ELSA also collect several health-
related behaviors that are in common
including smoking (currently and ever
smoke), alcohol consumption (heavy
drinking defined as drinking 4 days
per week in HRS and twice a day or
daily or almost daily in ELSA), and
weight and height (so that body mass
index, obesity, and overweight can be
calculated; body mass index is calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by
the square of height in meters). Al-
though other risk factors may be im-
portant, due to the comparative na-
ture of this research, we only used those
comparably measured in our data in
both countries.
Biological Measures
of Health Outcomes
Our biological measures include plasma
fibrinogen, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c
), C-reactive protein, and
HDL-C. In addition, respondents had
examinations during which their blood
pressure was taken. Such measures can
be used to validate respondents' self-
reports of specific diseases. More spe-

cifically, both NHANES and HSE re-
spondents were evaluated for diabetes
with an HbA1c
test. Although not usu-
ally a screener for diabetes, HbA1c
is
highly correlated with fasting plasma
glucose levels. Although there is no
strict diagnosis threshold value, we fol-
lowed the US convention by using val-
ues greater than or equal to 6.5% as in-
dicating clinical diabetes. Our results
on intercountry and intracountry dif-
ferences are not sensitive to the spe-
cific threshold chosen.
For hypertension, we follow the rec-
ommendations in the Sixth Report of
the Joint National Committee on the
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and
Treatment of High Blood Pressure of
1997--systolic blood pressure equal to
or greater than 140 mm Hg and/or
diastolic blood pressure equal to or
greater than 90 mm Hg and/or taking
medication.6
For the 3 remaining biological mea-
sures, there is no direct matching to re-
spondent self-reports. The primary is-
sue becomes whether variation in these
biological measures by SES and across
countries is similar to those obtained
for self-reports on heart diseases, for
which these biological measures
are well-established markers.7-9 C-
reactive protein is separated into 3
groups (3 mg/L indicates high risk,
between 1 but 3 is moderate risk, and
1 is low risk). For fibrinogen, the nor-
mal range is 200-400 mg/dL (5.88-
11.76 Âµmol/L), and higher than 400
mg/dL is considered a high risk for heart
disease. Finally, we divide HDL-C lev-
els into 3 groups (60 mg/dL [1.55
mmol/L]is described as high; 40-59
mg/dL [1.03-1.53 mmol/L], normal;
and 40 mg/dL (low). High-density li-
poprotein cholesterol levels in our high-
range stratum are associated with re-
duced risk of heart disease.3
Statistical Methods
In HRS and ELSA, age-specific disease
prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, all
heart disease, myocardial infarction,
stroke, lung disease, and cancer in both
countries is modeled as a function of
the 3 education and income indica-
tors, sex, and indicators for smoking,
alcohol consumption, overweight, and
obesity using ordinary least squares re-
gression (OLS) models and STATA sta-
tistical software version 9.0SE (STATA
Corp, College Station, Tex). All mod-
els use the appropriate sample weights
and all coefficients are allowed to dif-
fer between England and the United
States. Our main conclusions are un-
changed if multiple logistic or multi-
variate probit models are used or if sepa-
rate models are estimated for women
and men. Tests of statistical signifi-
cance between the countries are pro-
vided in all Tables. P.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.

the fraction of individuals who self- re-
port that they have 7 specific diseases--
diabetes, hypertension, heart disease,
myocardial infarctions, strokes, dis-
eases of the lung, and cancer. To en-
sure that patterns are not confounded
by age, comparisons are limited to those
aged 55 through 64 years old. Within
this age span, the average age of both
samples is identical.
The total columns list rates of dis-
easeprevalencebasedonindividualself-
reports of having each disease. All
analyses were also conducted sepa-
rately for men and women and the prin-
cipal substantive conclusions are un-
altered. Americans report higher levels
of disease than the English, and in most
cases much higher levels. These total
prevalence differences for all diseases
are always statistically significant. Dia-
betes prevalence is twice as high in
the United States (12.5%) compared
with England (6.1%). This between-
country differential exists for both
sexes, but male prevalence rates are
higher in both countries. Similarly, all
forms of cardiovascular diseases have
self-reported prevalence considerably
higher in the United States than in En-
gland. To illustrate, hypertension is
about 10 percentage points more com-
mon and all heart disease 6 percent-
age points higher in the United States.
And although heart-related condi-
tions are more common among men in
both countries a higher prevalence is
observed in the United States for each
sex. Finally, both lung disease and can-
cer exhibit a similar cross-country dif-
ferential--higher prevalence rates for
both sexes in the United States but now
the disease is more common among
women in both countries.
The second salient pattern high-
lighted in Table 1 concerns the health
gradient across the 2 classifiers of SES--
education and income. With the sole
exception of cancer, there exists a sharp
negative gradient across both educa-
tion and income groups in both coun-
tries. That is, disease prevalence is re-
ported to be much higher among those
at the bottom of either the education
or income ladder compared with those
at the top of each classification. Al-
though not universally true, income and
education gradients generally are
steeper in the United States than in En-
gland. As a result, country differences
are larger and tend to be more statisti-
cally different at the bottom of the
social hierarchy than at the top. Level
differences between countries are suf-
ficiently large that individuals in the top
of the education and income strata in
the United States have comparable rates
of diabetes and heart disease as those
in the bottom of the income and edu-
cation strata in England.
Differences in Risk Factors by SES
TABLE 2 lists the proportion of popu-
lation smoking, heavy drinking, and
with being overweight. On average,
smoking behavior is remarkably simi-
lar in both countries with about 1 in 5
people in this age group who cur-
rently smoke. Strong negative gradi-
ents across income and education ex-
ist in both countries, but the gradients
appear equally as large in both coun-
tries. Thus differential smoking behav-
ior by itself seems unlikely to explain
the higher concentration of disease
(particularly those related to smok-
ing) in the United States than in En-
gland or the particularly high levels at
the lower rungs of the SES classifica-
tion in United States.
In contrast, obesity is much higher in
the United States, an across-country
differential especially pronounced in the
lowest education and income groups. In
both countries, rates of obesity decline
with income and with education. Fi-
nally, there are higher rates of heavy
drinking in England. Because heavy
drinking is more common among those
at the top of the education and income
strata, it is an unlikely explanation for
theconcentrationofdiseaseamongthose
at the bottom in either country, al-
though more moderate drinking in high
SES groups could contribute to lower
heart disease risk.

To determine to what extent differ-
encesintheseriskfactorscanexplainany
salient differences in morbidity across
countries, we estimated ordinary least
squares regression models on each dis-
ease listed in Table 1. The explanatory
variables included all risk factors listed
in Table 2, indicator variables for the 3
education and 3 income groups used to
stratify in these Tables, and sex.
By and large, the risk factors per-
form in the expected direction. For ex-
ample, being obese tends to be associ-
ated with higher rates of diabetes,
hypertension, and myocardial infarc-
tions; and having ever smoked is
strongly associated with lung disease,
cancer, and myocardial infarctions.
These models were then used to
simulate what health conditions would
be if all individuals in both countries
had the same level of behavioral risk fac-
tors as the average American in this age
group. Risk-factor adjusted preva-
lence rates are displayed in TABLE 3. In
these simulations, we hold the popu-
lation sex distribution at US levels.
A comparison of these adjusted
prevalence rates with those in Table 1
indicates how much of between-
country difference in illness and how
much of the variation by SES in each
country is due to different levels of be-
havioral risk factors. This comparison
demonstrates that very little of the over-
all between-country differences in
health conditions are due to differ-
ences in this subset of behavioral risk
factors. To illustrate, less than one fifth
of the difference in diabetes between
the United States and England is ex-
plained by these risk factors.
With the sole exception of cancer, for
which there was no within-country SES
gradient to begin with, after control-
ling for these risk factors there re-
mains a steep income gradient in both
countries with those in the lower in-
come quintiles experiencing worse
health. Risk factors tend to account for
some of the differences in illness across
education groups, but for most dis-
eases the essential nature of the nega-
tive health gradient remains intact.
Differences in Reporting
Health Outcomes
Because controlling for a standard set
of behavioral risks does not explain why
Americans are less healthy than the En-
glish with health disparities largest at
the bottom of the SES hierarchy, the
principal explanations must lie else-
where. One possibility is that our de-
scription of comparative health out-
comes is exaggerated by relying on
individual self-reports. Perhaps due to
limited contact with the medical sys-
tem, individuals in different countries
or across different SES groups may be
unaware that they have a particular dis-
ease or may think they are cured when
the disease is only under control. Pro-
tocols and thresholds for specific dis-
ease diagnosis may differ so that a simi-
larly ill patient may be diagnosed with
a disease in one country but not in the
other. The language by which physi-
cians in the 2 countries communicate
health problems to their patients may
be different. For example, in England,
physicians may tell their patients that
they have problems with blood glu-
cose levels, which may not be under-
stood to imply diabetes.
One way of addressing reporting
issues involves examining biological
markers of disease risk in both coun-
tries. TABLE 4 summarizes results using
5 biological measures based on simi-

and HSE. Within our 40- to 70-year-
old age span, English respondents are
less than a year older than American
respondentssothatagedifferencescan-
notexplainthebetterhealthinEngland.
The findings from the self-reports are
generally confirmed. Diabetes preva-
lence is considerably higher in the
United States than in England, but
differences in hypertension preva-
lence are much smaller in this broader
age group. In addition to overall rates
of disease, Table 1 and Table 4 indi-
cate that a strong income or education
gradient exists in diabetes and hyper-
tension prevalence in both countries
whether self-reports or biological mea-
sures are used.
Although there is not a direct corre-
spondence between a disease self-
report and biological measures, the
other 3 biological measures provide ad-
ditional evidence about health in the 2
countries and how it varies across SES
categories. Several studies have shown
that C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and
HDL-C all serve as good markers for fu-
ture cardiovascular events.6,7
There are 2 striking patterns in
Table 4 and TABLE 5. First, all 3 bio-
logical measures indicate much higher
and statistically significant risk levels
in the United States. In this age group,
40.1% of Americans have C-reactive
protein levels within the high-risk
group compared with only 30.4% of En-
glish people. Similarly, 24% of the
American sample has measured fibrino-
gen levels that place them at high risk--
the comparable English rates are 10%.
On the other hand, 27.9% of Ameri-
cans have high levels of HDL-C com-
pared with 43.6% for the English.
Second, SES health gradients re-
main in both countries for education
(Table 4) and income (Table 5) in all
3 biological measures. Using C-
reactive protein, in the United States
57.8% in the lowest education group are
at high risk compared with 34.6% of
those in the highest schooling class. In
England, the comparable numbers are
40.2% and 25%, respectively. Espe-
cially along the income divide, there
is a somewhat steeper gradient in
the United States compared with En-
gland. Among all biological measures,
fibrinogen exhibits perhaps the sharp-
est SES gradients, a statement equally
true with education or income. These
socialgradientsaresteeperintheUnited
States than in England. Finally, for in-
come and especially for education, there
are sharper gradients in HDL-C levels
in the United States than in England.
Although we purposely selected as-
says that were similar in nature and
exhibit similar normal ranges of varia-

tion, an important priority for com-
parative international research is that
tests be performed by laboratories in
both countries on the same blood and
serum samples. We also modeled these
across-country differences in assays
controlling for smoking behavior, obe-
sity, and being overweight. Control-
ling for these risk factors did not elimi-
nate the statistically significant
differences between the countries.
COMMENT
Establishing basic facts about a less
healthy America and steep negative SES
health gradients is a first step toward un-
derstanding reasons for the differences
that emerge. Health disparities between
the United States and England are not
solely due to special health problems in
the Latino and especially the black com-
munities in the United States since those
important subpopulations were ex-
cluded from this analysis. And, impor-
tant as they are for better population
health, a standard set of risk factors
(smoking, drinking, and obesity) do not
fully account for morbidity differences
between and within each country.
Because screening rates for cancer are
generally higher in the United States
than in England, this may play a role
in the higher rates of cancer in the
United States. Greater incident mortal-
ity from cancer in England may also be
important.10,11 The magnitude of across-
country differences in cancer preva-
lence appears too large to be fully
explained by these factors alone. Dif-
ferences in cancer prevalence also ex-
ist in the high education and income
groups for whom differential detec-
tion should play a weaker role. More-
over, higher rates of detection do not
account for the higher rates of other ill-
nesses in lower socioeconomic groups.
Although access to health care is im-
portant,12-14 differential access can only
offer a partial explanation for our find-
ings. Among non-Hispanic whites aged
55 through 64 years, only 6.6% in the
United States do not report having ac-
cess to health insurance (calculations by
J.P.S. from HRS). Even in the bottom
third of the income distribution, in this
subpopulation only 13.1% did not have
some form of health insurance (calcu-
lationsbyJ.P.S.fromHRS).Becauseonly
2.6% of those in the top income tertile
did not have health insurance (calcula-
tions by J.P.S. from HRS), there is a gra-
dient to access, which may explain part
of the steeper US health gradient. But it
is equally important to recognize that
health insurance cannot be the central
reason for the better health outcomes in
England because the top SES tier of the
US population have close to universal
access but their health outcomes are of-

ten worse than those of their English
counterparts.
Our list of comparably measured be-
havioral risk factors is incomplete and
a fuller set may offer additional ex-
planatory power. Because the analysis
has been cross-sectional, past differ-
ences in risk factors may be partially un-
derlying observed differences in health
conditions for the older adults in our
samples. Smoking rates have histori-
cally been higher in the United King-
dom than the United States, but only
in recent years has the obesity epi-
demic hit the United Kingdom, where
prevalence of obesity rose from 7% to
23% between 1980 and 2003, whereas
the corresponding changes for the
United States were from 15% to 31%.15
Related, a growing body of recent re-
search indicates that disease onset in
later adulthood is related to child-
hood illness.16-18 The considerable dif-
ferences in adult health between En-
gland and the United States could well
have their origins in differential child-
hood experience of disease in the 2
countries.
Much evidence points to the social
determinants of health--the circum-
stances in which people live and
work--as explanation for social gradi-
ents in health.19 Low status is related
to adverse conditions at work, in resi-
dential areas, and in general, to lack of
empowerment--all are plausible links
between SES and disease.20 Whether the
same set of social determinants ac-
count for higher rates of morbidity in
the United States is difficult to say. Cer-
tainly the US-England difference is
more pronounced for those in the low-
est social groups, but the high status
Americans are also at a disadvantage.
This is fertile ground for additional ex-
ploration.
The finding of social gradients in
plasma levels of C-reactive protein, fi-
brinogen, and HDL-C, and adverse lev-
els in the United States compared with
England serve as an indirect valida-
tion of the morbidity findings and a
guide to potential explanations. The
metabolic syndrome is linked to auto-
nomic activity21 and to psychosocial
factors.22 Inflammatory markers, C-
reactive protein and fibrinogen, have
been shown to have an inverse asso-
ciation with socioeconomic position
and may be linked with psychosocial
factors.23 Adjusting for obesity did not
abolish either the international or the
socioeconomic differences in these bio-
logical markers.
The influence of inequality in eco-
nomic resources on health remains con-
troversial.24,25 Income inequality is in-
deed much higher in the United States
than in England,26 but the rapidly in-
creasing levels of inequality in the
United States do not appear to have had
a dramatic effect on the health of those
at the bottom.17,19 A more promising ex-
planation may lie rather in the effects
of more permanent measures of rank
and status in the 2 countries.16

of disease have relatively large impacts
on family income and wealth in the
UnitedStates,especiallyintheagegroup

extent, England has set up programs

tion of health and economic resources
in the United States may reflect the
greater impact of health on economic
resources.
Two simple but powerful conclu-
sions follow from our comparisons us-
ing biological and self-reports of dis-
ease in England and the United States.
First, Americans are much sicker than
the English. Self-reports of disease are
not deceiving us about the reality of the
situation on one side of the Atlantic vs
the other. Second, the SES-health gra-
dient is also not a reporting mirage; a
by-product of differential ability by
standard SES markers to recognize and
report disease in surveys, an ability that
has been thought might differ even
among the western industrialized coun-
tries. Instead, the SES health gradient
appears with equal force in either self-
reports or biological measures of health.
