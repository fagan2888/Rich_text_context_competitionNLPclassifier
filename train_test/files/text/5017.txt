Introduction
Political science theory has long held that lowering the costs
of voting increases electoral participation (Downs, 1957;
Highton, 2004; Riker & Ordeshook, 1968). One implication
of this conclusion is that adding more--and more conve-
nient--forms of political participation to the voting options
menu will lead to greater voter turnout (Gronke, Galanes-
Rosenbaum, Miller, & Toffey, 2008; McDonald & Popkin,
2001; Neeley & Richardson, 2001; Stein, 1998). In response
to this observation, jurisdictions across the United States are
embracing methods of "convenience voting," such as no-
excuse absentee balloting and voting in person before
Election Day. Indeed, over the past two decades, casting bal-
lots other than at the precinct place on the day of an election
has become commonplace in American politics (Gronke,
Galanes-Rosenbaum, & Miller, 2007; Gronke etal., 2008).
Among the variety of convenience voting options presently
in use, there is a "[r]apidly expanding list" of U.S. jurisdic-
tions that offer early in person (EIP) balloting opportunities
to their electorates (Gronke etal., 2008, p. 441). Although
the precise rules and hours of availability for this voting
method vary between and within states, the general idea is
that voters are permitted to cast ballots prior to an election, in
person, at satellite polling stations or county elections offices
(Gronke, 2008). Such programs expand an eligible individu-
al's set of voting options, which effectively reduces partici-
pation costs, and can therefore boost overall turnout (Gronke
etal., 2008).
Despite this common perception that turnout is positively
related to the diversity and quantity of voting opportunities
(Gronke etal., 2008; McDonald & Popkin, 2001; Neeley &
Richardson, 2001; Stein, 1998), several U.S. state legislatures

The Racial Context of Convenience
Voting Cutbacks: Early Voting in
Ohio During the 2008 and 2012 U.S.
Presidential Elections
Russell Weaver1
Abstract
Classic models of democratic political behavior imply that eliminating opportunities to vote early in person (EIP) negatively
affects the political participation of voters who prefer to use that option. Nevertheless, several U.S. state legislatures recently
passed or proposed laws to scale back their EIP voting operations. Such efforts have met with opposition, as both academic
researchers and federal courts have found that minority voters, especially African Americans, now utilize EIP voting at
significantly higher rates than White voters. Prior to the 2012 presidential election, this argument was central to a federal
court's decision to temporarily block legislation in Ohio that sought to cut several days from the state's EIP voting period.
A post-election legal battle is reconsidering this matter, and the outcome will shape Ohio's voting rules going forward. This
article contributes empirical results to the discourse by estimating EIP voting take-up rates, by race, during the 2008 and 2012
U.S. presidential elections in Ohio's three largest counties. Ecological inference models reveal that African Americans in all
three study areas voted EIP at substantially higher rates than White voters during both elections. These results are supported
by decile tables that report early voting behavior for relatively racially homogeneous geographies, and by geovisualizations
that depict direct relationships between the spatial distributions of minority persons and EIP voting usage. Collectively, the
findings suggest that the potential effects of Ohio's proposed policy changes would not be equally distributed between racial
groups.

recently passed or proposed laws designed to scale back their
statewide EIP voting operations (Brennan Center for Justice,
2012; Hasen, 2013). Popular justifications for such policy
changes include increasing efficiencies in or reducing the
costs of elections (e.g., Enns, n.d.; Viewpoint Florida, 2011).
However, many observers question whether the motivations
for these policies are purely administrative (Hasen, 2013).
For instance, some civil rights advocates claim that cutting
back on EIP voting programs disproportionately affects
minority voters, insofar as minorities seem to exercise the
option at greater rates than White voters (NAACP, 2011).
Other participants in the discourse take this line of reasoning
further into the realm of politics, by suggesting that minority
voters tendentially affiliate with the Democratic Party; hence,
any policy changes that disproportionately affect minority
voters will also disproportionately affect one of the major
U.S. political parties relative to its rival(s) (Greenblatt, 2011).
Casting the partisan dimension of the above argument
aside, the preceding observations do speak to a need to
address the question of who votes EIP. Regardless of legisla-
tive intent, if minorities in fact utilize EIP voting in greater
proportions than White voters, then changes to such institu-
tions can have inequitable effects. Previous studies have con-
cluded that the universe of convenience voters in general is
dominated by relatively wealthy, politically informed, and
educated individuals, and that White voters frequently pos-
sess these characteristics at higher rates than racial and eth-
nic minorities (Alvarez et
al., 2009; Berinsky, 2005).
Nevertheless, a growing body of research is finding that, for
EIP balloting more narrowly, the opposite situation might
hold (Alvarez, Levin, & Sinclair, 2012; Kropf, 2012; Robbins
& Salling, 2012). Federal courts even acknowledged recently
that minority and low-income voters often exhibit higher
propensities to vote EIP compared with other socioeconomic
and demographic groups (Hasen, 2013; Obama for America
[OFA] v. Husted, 2012 [see Preliminary Pretrial Order]).
Thus, there is no clear-cut answer to the aforementioned
"who" question, and this ambiguity creates a demand for
new empirical research on the topic (e.g., Gronke et
al.,
2007).
The current article begins to fill this gap by empirically
estimating EIP voting behavior, by race, during the 2008 and
2012 presidential elections for the three largest counties in
the state of Ohio: Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton. The
article relies on King's (1997) method of ecological infer-
ence to produce its estimates, which are supported with
decile tables and geovisualizations. By focusing on the larg-
est counties in Ohio, the article intends to, first, study the
early voting behavior of a relatively large share of voters in
the state and, second, offer immediate contributions to Ohio's
early voting policy discourses. Explicitly, newly passed leg-
islative measures in Ohio aimed at reducing EIP voting
opportunities were temporarily blocked by a federal court
prior to the 2012 presidential election, and a post-election
legal battle will now determine the (immediate) fate of the
Ohio early voting policy going forward (NAACP v. Husted,
2014; OFA v. Husted, 2012 [see Preliminary Pretrial Order]).
This article seeks to add timely evidence to these current
legal and political proceedings.
Critically, the findings produced herein broadly support
the growing narrative that minority voters, particularly
African Americans, cast EIP ballots at higher rates than
White voters. This finding implies that more African
Americans than Whites in Ohio's largest counties would
have to adjust their voting behavior under the proposed EIP
voting rule changes. It is plausible that similar voting pat-
terns are present elsewhere within Ohio, as well as in juris-
dictions across the United States. Thus, assertions that
minority voters will be disparately affected by reductions in
EIP voting opportunities (e.g., NAACP, 2011) are seemingly
well founded. These observations have important implica-
tions for public policy.
Background
A detailed overview of convenience voting is beyond the
scope of this article, and such information can be found in
the work of Gronke (2008) and his collaborators (Gronke
etal., 2007; Gronke etal., 2008). The objective here is to
identify the racial characteristics of one specific class of con-
venience voters: those who cast ballots in person prior to
Election Day. The decision to focus on race as opposed to
other characteristics that influence political behavior, such as
age, gender, education, or income, is based on the present
state of legal affairs in the American voting rights commu-
nity. Briefly, several U.S. states that recently faced or are fac-
ing opposition to their efforts to change EIP voting rules
have been challenged under the federal Voting Rights Act
(e.g., State of Florida v. U.S., 2012). For many challenged
jurisdictions, this places a burden of proof on the state to
demonstrate that proposed early voting reforms will not have
retrogressive effects on minority voting efficacy once they
are implemented (e.g., Hasen, 2013). More explicitly, the
new rules cannot decrease the strength of minority voters,
which includes increasing their costs of voting, relative to
the status quo (Voting Rights Act 42 U.S.C. 1973).1 In debat-
ing the merit of cutting back on EIP voting opportunities,
then, it is of crucial importance to determine whether or not
minorities and Whites utilize the method at differential rates,
and, by extension, whether different racial groups will be
disparately affected.
Empirical evidence related to this question is somewhat
mixed, though this situation might be an artifact of timing.
For instance, prior to the 2008 U.S. presidential election,
American political scientists supported the idea that conve-
nience voters as a whole were politically active, well edu-
cated, and members of higher income classes--attributes
often associated disproportionately with White voters. In
fact, Berinsky (2005) described this perspective on conve-
nience voting as the "single conclusion" among political
Weaver 3
science scholars. Yet, whereas such a conclusion might have
been appropriate at the time of that writing, more recent stud-
ies intimate that the unparalleled efforts of the 2008 Barack
Obama presidential campaign to get-out-the-vote early
among minority voters possibly brought about a change
point in group convenience voting behavior (e.g., Alvarez
etal., 2009; Gronke, Hicks, & Toffey, 2009; Hood & Bullock,
2011). Namely, there is growing evidence of an inchoate
shift in the electorate, whereby minority voters in many
jurisdictions now appear to have a greater propensity than
White voters to cast EIP ballots (Alvarez etal., 2009;Alvarez
etal., 2012).
Consider, for example, that judges in a recent federal elec-
tion law case denied the state of Florida preclearance to
decrease its existing early voting time period because known
(administrative) data showed that minority voters exercised
the EIP option at significantly higher rates than White voters
in four out of the prior five federal elections, including at a
substantially higher rate in the 2008 presidential election
(Hasen, 2013). This observation led the judges to opine that
such a pattern is likely to continue into the future (State of
Florida v. U.S., 2012 [see Per Curium Opinion]). Unlike the
Florida example, though, most states, including Ohio, do not
collect racial information on individual voters (e.g., King,
1997, 1999; Orey, Overby, Hatemi, & Liu, 2011; Roch &
Rushton, 2008; Weaver, 2014). This means that the majority
of U.S. states cannot appeal to known administrative data to
describe EIP voting patterns by race in their jurisdictions, for
the simple reason that such data do not exist. In that sense,
the earlier "who votes EIP" question can be an extremely
difficult one to answer.
To address this challenge, comparable studies for Ohio
have adopted a proportionality rule, or "neighborhood
model," to allocate EIP voters to racial groups using popula-
tion data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Under this rule, EIP
voters are aggregated to census geographies, and the percent-
age of the census population in a given geographic unit that
is, say, African American, is assumed to equal the African
American share of EIP voters in that area (Robbins & Salling,
2012). For example, if the racial composition of census tract
XYZ is 40% African American, and if 100 EIP ballots were
cast in tract XYZ, then according to the proportionality
assumption, tract XYZ is home to 40 African American EIP
voters. Although findings from neighborhood model studies
for Ohio (Robbins & Salling, 2012) fit with the recent litera-
ture suggesting that minorities vote EIP at higher rates than
Whites (Alvarez etal., 2012; Kropf, 2012), the proportional
allocation method is not a reliable technique for inferring
group voting behavior (Garza v. County of Los Angeles,
1990; King, 1999; O'Loughlin, 2000). For these reasons, the
current article relies instead on King's (1997) method of eco-
logical inference (King's EI) to derive estimates for EIP take-
up rates by race. King's EI has been viewed favorably by
federal judges in voting rights cases (Greiner, 2007), and it is
used widely in similarly motivated social science research
(Liu, 2001; Orey etal., 2011; Roch & Rushton, 2008; Tolbert
& Grummel, 2003; Tolbert & Hero, 2001; Voss, 1996, 2000;
Voss & Miller, 2001). Nonetheless, the method is not without
its critics (Anselin & Cho, 2002; Calvo & Escolar, 2003;
Cho, 1998; Freedman, Klein, Ostland, & Roberts, 1998;
Greiner, 2007), and, consequently, the estimates that it pro-
duces are supported by, and discussed within the context of,
supplementary decile analyses and geovisualizations (refer
to the "Data and Method" section below).
Study Area and Regional Context
In 2005, all registered voters in Ohio were granted eligibility
to vote in person during the full 35-day period prior to
Election Day, including weekends (OFA v. Husted, 2012 [see
Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary Injunction]).
Following a series of proposals to change that program, the
Ohio state legislature passed rules in 2011 and 2012 to end
EIP voting for all voters on weekends, and to terminate the
EIP balloting period for non-military voters on the Friday
before an election. Under the original regulations, this latter
termination date fell 3 days later, on the Monday immedi-
ately prior to Election Day (OFA v. Husted, 2012 [see Opinion
and Order Granting Preliminary Injunction]). Shortly after
their passage, these proposed rule changes were legally chal-
lenged by the 2012 presidential campaign of Barack Obama
(OFA), which sought to maintain the full 35-day EIP voting
period that was implemented in 2005. OFA argued that EIP
voters disproportionately tend to be members of minority
groups--especially African Americans--and the working
class, and thus, shortening the EIP voting period would
unduly harm these historically disadvantaged populations
(Hasen, 2013; OFA v. Husted, 2012 [see Opinion and Order
Granting Preliminary Injunction]). To support this assertion,
OFA pointed to election studies that utilized the proportional
rule (i.e., neighborhood model) with U.S. census data to esti-
mate the minority share of Ohio's EIPvoter universe. Perhaps
the most influential of these studies found that more than half
of 2008 EIP voters hailing from Ohio's largest county,
Cuyahoga County, were African Americans (Robbins &
Salling, 2012).
Ultimately, these arguments and empirical findings fac-
tored into a federal judge's decision to grant OFA a prelimi-
nary injunction, thereby temporarily upholding the existing
(i.e., 2005) Ohio early voting period (Hasen, 2013; OFA v.
Husted, 2012 [see Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary
Injunction]). Currently, the court is preparing to hear addi-
tional arguments from civil rights groups and the state of
Ohio, as there remains uncertainty over the fate of Ohio's
early voting period (OFA v. Husted, 2012 [see Preliminary
Pretrial Order]; NAACP v. Husted, 2014). Accordingly, the
issue is not necessarily settled either legally or as a public
policy matter. For that reason, studies that aim to systemati-
cally estimate the differences between racial group EIP vot-
ing take-up rates--both for other study areas in Ohio and for
4 SAGE Open
more elections--are potentially valuable new contributions
to the discourse. It is toward these ends that the subsequent
analyses are directed.
Data and Method
Following the examples set forth by research that entered
into the Ohio early voting legal proceedings prior to the 2012
general election (OFA v. Husted, 2012; Robbins & Salling,
2012), this article examines EIP voting behavior for Ohio's
three largest counties--Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton
(Figure 1). Although it would perhaps be preferable to con-
duct the analysis for all counties in the state, necessary voter
data (as discussed below) are maintained by individual
county-level Boards of Elections (BOE). As a consequence,
data must be acquired by public information requests on a
county-by-county basis. It follows that all data management
and processing operations must similarly occur on a county-
by-county basis. To perform such activities for all 88 Ohio
counties would be quite demanding. In an effort to econo-
mize, this article focuses only on the three counties named
above. By design, the selected counties contain the three
most populated cities in Ohio, as well as a large number of
suburban and low-density communities. What is more, the
selected counties are geographically dispersed throughout
the state (Figure 1), and they contain nearly 30% of Ohio's
voting-age population (VAP) and registered voters (Ohio
Secretary of State). Arguably, three counties with significant
urban settlements cannot possibly represent a full cross-sec-
tion of an 88-county state. However, if any potentially dis-
proportionate impacts from the desired election law changes
are observed in these large population regions, then one can
conclude (with some confidence) that a sufficiently sizable
bloc of Ohio voters--again, the three counties are home to
Figure 1. Study areas: Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton Counties, Ohio, USA.
Weaver 5
roughly 30% of all registrants in the state--might be nega-
tively affected by the rule changes. Such a result would argue
against rushing into the proposed policy changes, and instead
suggest that additional analyses ought to be undertaken.
Having specified the study areas, the U.S. census tract is
selected as the geographic unit of analysis for its advantages
with respect to data availability and completeness. In con-
trast to smaller census block groups or census blocks, only a
negligible number of census tracts in the study areas are
unpopulated and/or not matched to voters who participated
in the selected elections (Table 1). Such "zero" units are gen-
erally dropped from the analysis when constructing the
bounds needed to estimate early voting rates by race using
King's method of EI (see, for example, King, 1997, p. 79).
The upshot is that very few census tracts must be dropped
from the analysis to facilitate the desired estimation proce-
dure, which is not true of smaller spatial units. That being
said, for each census tract in each county, data were collected
on four quantities of interest: (a) the number of voters who
cast EIP ballots in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections;
(b) the number of individuals who cast any type of ballot in
these elections, that is, the number of voters who partici-
pated; (c) the size of the VAP; and (d) the racial characteris-
tics of the VAP.
Data on individual voters who participated in the selected
elections (Quantity 2) and lists of voters who cast EIP ballots
during those elections (Quantity 1) were obtained through
public information requests made to the relevant county
BOEs. All voter records were then batch geocoded in Esri
ArcGIS 10.1. The resultant data points were aggregated to
census tracts, where they were merged with 2010 U.S. decen-
nial census tract-level VAP data (Quantities 3 and 4). The
2010 decennial census figures are used for at least two rea-
sons. First, federal district court judges in OFA v. Husted
(2012, see Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary
Injunction) recently relied on a study of the 2008 general
election to form their judicial opinion, and that study instruc-
tively used 2010 census VAP data (Robbins & Salling, 2012).
Second, reliable full count tract-level data for the years 2008
and 2012 are not available. Thus, the (known) 2010 data are
a convenient compromise. Table 1 summarizes the key infor-
mation from each county-specific data set.
Alongside the summary data, Table 1 also reports a hand-
ful of negligible discrepancies between the voter data fur-
nished by the County BOEs, the official turnout results
available on the Ohio Secretary of State Elections website,
and the fraction of voters that were successfully georefer-
enced (and hence, included in the analysis). Because the

voter files did not come with metadata indicating how que-
ries to select general election voters were performed, it is not
possible to pinpoint the exact reasons for the discrepancies
between the official turnout figures and the number of
records in the BOE data sets; however, given that the differ-
ences are sufficiently small, it is reasonable to assume that
they will not affect the analyses. Moreover, insofar as the
data were received directly from the BOEs through public
information requests, they are taken to be reliable. Finally,
the sufficiently high percentages of voter records from the
BOE data files that were successfully matched during the
geocoding processes add to our confidence in the analytical
samples (Table 1, columns 5 and 9).
As stated earlier, because the vast majority of states do not
capture data related to an individual's race or ethnicity dur-
ing the voter registration and ballot casting processes, racial
group disparities in voter participation or the type of ballot
cast cannot be ascertained from most state registration
records alone (King, 1997, 1999; Orey etal., 2011; Roch &
Rushton, 2008). Rather, to evaluate these questions, voter
records must be merged with data from other sources--here,
the U.S. Census Bureau--that collect racial information on a
superset (voting-age persons) of the target population (vot-
ers). When aggregated and overlaid, these multiple data lay-
ers begin to reveal details about the unobserved behavior of
interest. One technique for deducing early voting behavior
by race with such data is to examine the take-up of EIP vot-
ing in relatively racially homogeneous geographies, and to
hypothesize that the behavior observed therein is relatively
representative of voters from the given racial group (Brace,
Handley, Niemi, & Stanley, 1995).
In Table 2, decile analyses reveal that voters in relatively
homogeneous African American census tracts (90% of
VAP) in Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton Counties utilized
EIP voting at substantially higher rates than voters in largely
non­African American (<10% of VAP) tracts during the
2008 and 2012 elections. Consequently, it is sensible to
expect that more sophisticated statistical estimation tech-
niques will find that African American voters use EIP voting
at much higher rates than, for instance, White voters, in the
study areas.
Conclusions drawn about individuals based on aggregate
data in this fashion, so-called "ecological inferences," are
often necessary in social science research (King 1997, 1999).
Nevertheless, the homogeneous geographies approach to
making such inferences is not the only option. Indeed, a large
body of statistical literature explores ways to overcome the
EI problem (Anselin & Cho, 2002; Calvo & Escolar, 2003;
Duncan & Davis, 1953; Goodman, 1953; Grofman &
Migalski, 1988; King, 1997). This article uses King's (1997)
"solution" to the problem (King's EI) to estimate EIP usage
by race. King's EI is widely used in studies of group voting
behavior (Liu, 2001; Orey etal., 2011; Roch & Rushton,
2008; Tolbert & Grummel, 2003; Tolbert & Hero, 2001;
Voss, 1996, 2000; Voss & Miller, 2001; Weaver, 2014), and
it has gained "favorability" among federal judges in voting-
related cases (Greiner, 2007; Withers, 2001). It is, therefore,
considered to be an "established method" for this type of
research (Collett, 2005).
For present purposes, King's EI involves first estimating
voter turnout by race for each county of interest, by drawing
on known census tract-level data for the (a) size of tract VAP,
(b) percentage of VAP that voted in the selected elections,
and (c) racial breakdown of tract VAP. Following existing
Ohio early voting studies (Robbins & Salling, 2012), we
focus here on two racial groups: non-Hispanic Whites
(White), and non-Hispanic African Americans (Black). For
each of these racial groups, turnout estimates for all tracts in
each of the three counties are first constrained by determinis-
tic (feasible) bounds based on the observed U.S. Census data
(King, 1997). Next, all feasible turnout values for each cen-
sus tract are analyzed in the context of maximum likelihood
to derive point estimates and standard errors for tract-level
racial group turnout (Roch & Rushton, 2008). The point esti-
mates for turnout are then used to generate "step two" esti-
mates of EIP take-up rates by race for each county, via
estimating second-step King's EI equations in much the
same way as above (King, 1997; see also Roch & Rushton,
2008). These quantities allow one to draw conclusions about
whether minorities--in this case, African Americans--uti-
lized EIP voting disproportionately relative to Whites in the
selected Ohio counties during the 2008 and 2012 general
elections. Answering this question is of central importance
for managing conflicts in Ohio and throughout the United
States over proposed cutbacks to EIP voting opportunities
(e.g., Brennan Center for Justice, 2012; Greenblatt, 2011;
Hasen, 2013; NAACP, 2011; OFA v. Husted, 2012 [see
Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary Injunction];
Robbins & Salling, 2012; State of Florida v. U.S., 2012 [see
Per Curium Opinion]).
Finally, because King's (1997) method is not without crit-
ics (e.g., Anselin & Cho, 2002; Calvo & Escolar, 2003; Cho,
1998; Freedman etal., 1998; Greiner, 2007), the EI estimates
are supported with geovisualization techniques that make
use of choropleth mapping and three-dimensional extrusion
to simultaneously map two geographic distributions across
the three county study areas. The distributions of interest are
(a) African Americans as a fraction of VAP and (b) EIP votes
as a fraction of all ballots cast. The resultant three-dimen-
sional maps further support the notion that EIP voting is not
equally practiced by members of different racial groups.
Results
The global results from estimating the basic King's EI
county-level models for White and African American voters
are presented in Table 3. For each county, a Step 1 EI model
first estimates racial group turnout as a fraction of racial
group VAP. A Step 2 model then estimates racial group usage
of the EIP ballot option as a fraction of group turnout from
Weaver 7
the Step 1 model (e.g., King, 1997; Roch & Rushton, 2008).
Each global estimate is listed in Table 3 with its correspond-
ing standard error and the approximate number of individu-
als included in the given category. The latter quantity is
calculated by distributing the King's EI (%) estimate through
the relevant population count. Falling in line with contempo-
rary academic literature (e.g., Gronke et
al., 2009) and
reports by civil rights groups that study the effects of the
Barack Obama candidacy on minority electoral participation
(e.g., NAACP, 2011), the Step 1 EI estimates reveal that the
turnout gap between African Americans and Whites is clos-
ing. In fact, for Cuyahoga County, the estimated African
American turnout exceeded the estimated White turnout in
2008, and this difference increased in magnitude in 2012.
Hence, the Step 1 EI estimates comport with the idea that the
Obama candidacy potentially reshaped the electorate to
include more traditionally underrepresented voters relative
to all previous presidential elections (Gronke etal., 2009).
More central to this article, Step 2 estimates for the
group rates of EIP voting are extremely racially unbal-
anced. In 2008, African Americans in Cuyahoga County
were approximately 26 times more likely than Whites to
vote EIP, and approximately 20 times more likely than
Whites to exercise the option in 2012. To put this difference

in perspective, in both 2008 and 2012, African Americans
accounted for an estimated 29% of the overall electorate;
yet, the racial group represented a staggering 77% of the
EIP voter universe. This substantial disproportionality
implies a crucial difference in inter-group voting prefer-
ences, and it suggests that minority voters are likely to be
negatively affected if opportunities to vote EIP are elimi-
nated. Similar results hold for Franklin and Hamilton
Counties. In Franklin County, African American voters uti-
lized EIP voting at roughly a four-to-one rate relative to
Whites in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, and the
same ratio was approximately nine-to-one for Hamilton
County. As is estimated to be the case in Cuyahoga County,
the early voter universes in both Franklin and Hamilton
Counties were significantly, disproportionately African
American when compared with the White and Black shares
of the jurisdictions' overall voter turnout (Table 3).
Notably, the EI estimation results are highly consistent
with the homogeneous geographies (decile) analyses from
the "Data and Method" section (Table 2). This consistency
lends credibility to the EI output from Table 3. Still, to add
more depth to the results, Figures 2 to 4 map the geo-
graphic distributions of African American voting-age per-
sons in each county, by census tract, relative to the county's
tract-level EIP take-up rates. For each figure, census tracts
that are symbolized with blue hues represent areas where
African Americans make up relatively small shares (40%)
of total tract VAP. Tracts that are symbolized with red hues
are those territories where African Americans hold rela-
tively strong majorities (>60%) in the local VAP. The verti-
cal height of each tract corresponds to its average EIP
take-up rate over the course of the 2008 and 2012 presi-
dential elections. That is, the height (extrusion) is
calculated by adding a given tract's 2008 EIP take-up rate
to its 2012 EIP take-up rate, and dividing by two. Height,
therefore, falls in the range of zero to one. Note that the
average EIP take-up rates are mapped in the figures for
economy, rather than creating separate figures for each
election. Mapping the averages not only cuts the number
of necessary figures in half, but also, it eliminates some-
what redundant information, as the patterns for 2008 and
2012 do not show much temporal change (or spatial varia-
tion from the average patterns).
In all three figures it is evident that, in the main, tracts
where African Americans make up a majority of the VAP are
also those tracts where EIP usage is greatest in magnitude.
This pattern is particularly striking in Cuyahoga County
(Figure 2), where the "red" tracts tower over all but one
"blue" tract. Falling in line with the decile analyses (Table 2)
and the EI results (Table 3), Figures 2 to 4 support the
hypothesis that the negative effects from scaling back EIP
institutions in Ohio will not be equitably distributed between
all racial groups in the state (e.g., Hasen, 2013; OFA v.
Husted, 2012 [see Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary
Injunction]; Robbins & Salling, 2012).
Discussion
The results presented in the preceding two sections offer
consistent quantitative support for the notion that minori-
ties in Ohio, especially African Americans, tend to vote
EIP at much higher rates than White voters. In consider-
ation of prior empirical work (Alvarez etal., 2012; Kropf,
2012), as well as anecdotal evidence from electoral poli-
tics (Gustafson, 2008), this finding is not altogether unex-
pected. What makes the results somewhat surprising,

though, are the magnitudes of the estimated dispropor-
tionalities between White and African American EIP vot-
ing take-up rates. Earlier estimates derived under the
proportional rule or "neighborhood model"--that is, by
assuming that the fraction of VAP within a given observa-
tional that is African American is strictly equal to the frac-
tion of EIP votes cast by African Americans in the same
area--suggested that about half of Cuyahoga County's
2008 EIP voters were African Americans (Robbins &
Salling, 2012). In contrast, estimates derived using King's
EI method, which are supported by supplementary decile
analysis (Table 2), suggest that African Americans consis-
tently accounted for more than three quarters of the
Cuyahoga County EIP voter universe during both the 2008
and 2012 presidential elections, and between 42% and
72% of all EIP voters in Franklin and Hamilton Counties.
One potential reason for the large discrepancy between
the neighborhood and EI estimates for Cuyahoga County
is that by limiting a racial group's share of the EIP uni-
verse to equal that group's share of the overall VAP, the
neighborhood approach likely misrepresents the behavior
of minority voters in predominantly non­African
American geographies (e.g., compare the first and last
rows in each decile table contained in Table 2); where
King's EI method allows for more possibilities.
Nevertheless, prior to the 2012 presidential election, fed-
eral judges relied exclusively on proportional (neighbor-
hood) estimates when they decided to temporarily block
Ohio's proposed early voting changes (OFA v. Husted,
2012 [see Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary
Injunction]).
It is worth mentioning, then, that the findings from this
article imply that the extent of the adjudged "injury" to minor-
ity voters from Ohio's proposed rule changes might be even
greater than what the court acknowledged at the time of its
decision. In that sense, one can speculate that if federal judges
temporarily blocked the proposed early voting cutbacks in the
state based on proportional estimates of EIP voting by race in
one large county, then, given the King's EI estimates derived
hereinbefore for Ohio's three largest counties, the current
round of legal proceedings is likely to disfavor policies that
will decrease early voting opportunities in the state.

Conclusion
It is almost tautological to claim that a policy that reduces
EIP voting opportunities in a given jurisdiction will nega-
tively affect voters who prefer to use the EIP option. Thus,
the question at issue in the legal discourse is not whether
cutting back on early voting operations will affect existing
early voters--it is whether or not such changes will affect
those voters equitably. Along these lines, the results from
above reaffirm prior claims that minority voters, particularly
African Americans, account for a disproportionately large
share of the EIP voter universe in Ohio (Robbins & Salling,
2012). Although this is not to say that minority voters in
Ohio's largest counties will necessarily be excluded from
voting because of the proposed state law changes, a practical
interpretation of the results is that eliminating opportunities
to vote EIP effectively raises the cost of voting for more
African Americans than for Whites. This is the case because
the former group contains substantially more EIP voters,
both in relative and absolute terms, than the latter (Table 3).
Hence, more minority voters than White voters in Ohio will
face new adjustment costs under the proposed rule changes.
That being said, political science literature collectively
agrees that voting costs and political participation are
inversely related (e.g., Downs, 1957; Gronke etal., 2007;
Gronke etal., 2008; Highton, 2004; McDonald & Popkin,
2001; Neeley & Richardson, 2001; Riker & Ordeshook,
1968; Stein, 1998). Therefore, any negative turnout effects
caused by a shortened early voting period, should that out-
come occur, will most likely be driven by decreases in minor-
ity participation. Put differently, regardless of the intent of
the early voting law changes, based on the racial disparities
observed in early voting behavior, the new rules could have
an inequitable effect in Ohio's largest counties.
In this context, although the present study focused only on
the two most recent presidential elections in three Ohio
counties, more and more evidence is accumulating to suggest
that African American voters across the United States prefer
to exercise EIP voting options at greater rates than Whites
(Alvarez etal., 2009; Alvarez etal., 2012; Kropf, 2012). For
example, in the state of Florida, where racial data are col-
lected on individual voters, a federal three-court judge in
2012 denied the state preclearance for proposed reductions in
the number of days it offers EIP balloting, given that racial
minorities were found to vote EIP at substantially higher
rates than Whites (State of Florida v. U.S., 2012 [see Per
Curium Opinion]). Similar to Florida, Georgia collects racial
data on individual voter registrants, and studies of early vot-
ing behavior in that state find a "higher incidence of [EIP]
turnout" among African Americans, especially for the 2008
presidential election (Hood & Bullock, 2011).
Considered in tandem with this complementary evidence
based on known racial group voting behavior, the foregoing
results imply that policies that set out to eliminate conve-
nience voting opportunities should not be pursued in
isolation of empirical insights into the racial characteristics
of affected voters. Additional research on the topic, espe-
cially in the form of program evaluations that identify causal
relationships between new early voting policies and voter
turnout, is needed to explore actual behavioral adjustments,
by race, to the types of cutbacks discussed throughout this
article. At present, however, based on the current state of the
literature, it is prudent to recognize that further legislative
action toward the early voting reductions in Ohio and else-
where in the United States demands greater attention to the
racial context of the proposed rule changes.
