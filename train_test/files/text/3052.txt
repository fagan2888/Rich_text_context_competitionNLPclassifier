TOBACCO USE IS INCREASING
among young Americans. Ciga-
rette smoking rates among ado-
lescents increased by 32% be-
tween 1991 and 1997.1,2 Cigarette
smoking by young adults (18-24 years)
increased by 16% between 1995 and
1997, presumably reflecting the aging of
the adolescent cohort.2 Young adults,
who represent the youngest legal tar-
gets of tobacco industry marketing, may
also be initiating tobacco use in larger
numbers. If this trend continues, it
threatens to reverse the decline in smok-
ing prevalence among US adults that has
occurred during the past half century.3
The smoking behavior of college stu-
dents is a useful index of tobacco use
among young adults. More than one
third of adults aged 18 to 24 years at-
tend college, and one quarter attend a
4-year college.4 US colleges and univer-
sities enroll more than 12 million stu-
dents5 and are a potential site for inter-
ventions to discourage tobacco use.
Between1993and1997,cigarettesmok-
ing prevalence increased 28%amongUS
college students.6 Whether this trend is
continuing needs to be determined.
There is also reason to suspect that
college students use a broader range of
tobacco products than cigarettes, al-
though this has not been assessed.7 Ci-

Context Adults aged 18 to 24 years, many of whom are in college, represent the
youngest legal targets for tobacco industry marketing. Cigarette smoking has been
described among college students, but little is known about noncigarette tobacco use
by college students or cigar use by adults of any age.
Objectives To assess the prevalence of all forms of tobacco use (cigarettes, cigars,
pipes, and smokeless tobacco) among US college students and to identify student-
and college-level factors associated with use of each product.
Design The Harvard College Alcohol Survey, a self-administered survey conducted
in 1999.
Setting One hundred nineteen nationally representative US 4-year colleges.
Subjects A total of 14138 randomly selected students (60% response rate).
Main Outcome Measures Self-report of current (in the past 30 days), past-year,
and lifetime use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, and all tobacco
products.
Results Nearly half (45.7%) of respondents had used a tobacco product in the past
year and one third (32.9%) currently used tobacco. Cigarettes accounted for most of
the tobacco use (28.5% current prevalence), but cigar use was also substantial
(37.1% lifetime prevalence, 23.0% past-year prevalence, and 8.5% current preva-
lence) and combinations of the 2 were common. Total tobacco use was higher in
men than in women (37.9% vs 29.7%; P.001), despite nearly identical current
cigarette smoking rates between the sexes (28.5% for women vs 28.4% for men),
because of greater use of cigars (current prevalence, 15.7% vs 3.9%; P.001) and
smokeless tobacco (current prevalence, 8.7% vs 0.4%; P.001) by men. Tobacco
use was significantly higher among white students (P.001), users of other sub-
stances (alcohol and marijuana) (P.001), and students whose priorities were social
rather than educational or athletic (P.05). Among students who had used both
cigars and cigarettes, only 8.9% smoked cigars at an earlier age than they had
smoked cigarettes.
Conclusion Our study indicates that tobacco use is common among college stu-
dents and is not limited to cigarettes. College appears to be a time when many stu-
dents are trying a range of tobacco products and are in danger of developing lifelong
nicotine dependence. National efforts to monitor and reduce tobacco use of all types
should expand to focus on college students and other young adults.

in cigar sales presumably corresponds
to an increase in cigar smoking preva-
lence, but this is uncertain because re-
cent data on the prevalence of cigar use
are limited and not based on national
samples.11,12 Data from California sug-
gestthatcigaruseisincreasingmostrap-
idly among young adults, who had the
lowest rates of cigar use before 1990.9,11
Cigar smoking rates are higher among
individuals with more education and
higher incomes, a pattern opposite to
that observed for cigarette smoking.2,11
High rates of cigar use were reported by
adolescents in high school surveys con-
ducted between 1996 and 1999.1,13-15
These adolescents may continue to
smoke cigars as they enter young adult-
hood. These lines of evidence suggest
thattheprevalenceofcigarsmokingmay
be especially high in college students. As
young adults in the process of further-
ing their education, college students ap-
pear to fit the demographic profile of
new cigar smokers.
Consequently, total tobacco use by
youngadultsmaybeconsiderablyhigher
than has been detected by previous
analyses limited to cigarettes.6 Little is
known about the full spectrum of to-
bacco use among the college popula-
tion or about risk factors for the use of
different tobacco products.8 This infor-
mation is essential to guide the devel-
opment of interventions. This article re-
ports the prevalence and patterns of use
of all tobacco products among respon-
dents to the 1999 Harvard College Al-
cohol Survey, a large nationally repre-
sentative sample of US college students.
METHODS
Sample of Colleges
The Harvard College Alcohol Study
surveyed randomly selected, cross-
sectional samples of students in a na-
tionally representative sample of 4-year,
US colleges in 1993, 1997, and 1999.
Details of the method and sampling pro-
cedures are published elsewhere.16,17 In
1999, 128 (91%) of the original 140 col-
leges that participated in the 1993 study
were resurveyed. Participating col-
leges were sent guidelines for drawing
a random sample of undergraduates
from their total enrollment of full-
time students. A sample of 225 was se-
lected from each college. Nine (7%) of
the 128 schools were dropped from
analyses because of low response rates
(less than 40% of eligible students
responding). The final sample was 119
colleges. Cigarette and cigar use rates
did not differ significantly between
these 119 colleges and the total sample
of 128 colleges, indicating that omis-
sion of the 9 schools had no effect on
the major variable under study. The 119
colleges are located in 39 states (24%
in the Northeast, 29% in the South, 29%
in the North Central, and 18% in the
West). Seventy-one percent are lo-
cated in urban or suburban settings, and
29% are in small town or rural set-
tings. More than two thirds are public
institutions. Forty-four percent have
more than 10000 students, 23% have
5001 to 10000 students, and 34% have
less than 5000 students. Fifteen per-
cent have a religious affiliation. Five
percent enroll only women.
Sample of Students
Questionnaires were mailed to 23751
students at the 119 schools in Febru-
ary 1999. Three separate mailings were
sent: a questionnaire, a reminder post-
card, and a second questionnaire. Re-
sponses were anonymous. Cash awards
were used to encourage students to re-
spond. Sixty percent of students
(n=14138) returned questionnaires.
Response rates varied between 40% and
83% among the 119 colleges. To ex-
plore the potential for bias due to stu-
dent nonresponse, a short form of the
questionnaire that included a smok-
ing question was mailed to a sample of
students who did not return the 1999
questionnaire. Past 30-day cigarette
smoking rates did not differ signifi-
cantly between respondents to the short
survey and respondents to the entire
student survey (25% vs 28%, P=.17).
The correlations between individual
colleges' response rates and their 30-
day cigar and cigarette prevalence were
0.04 (P=.68) and 0.01 (P=.11), respec-
tively, indicating little chance for bias
on this basis.
Sixty-one percent of the respon-
dents were female compared with 53%
of the full-time undergraduate popu-
lation of the 119 participating schools.18
Respondents' ethnicity (76% non-
Hispanic white, 7% Hispanic, 6% black,
and 8% Asian) closely resembles that
of all students at the 119 schools (76%
white, 7% Hispanic, and 5% black).18
Eighty-five percent of respondents were
18- to 24-year-olds; 23% were fresh-
men, 22% sophomores, 25% juniors,
22% seniors, and 8% fifth-year or post-
graduate students. Respondents' age
distribution closely matches that of stu-
dents at all 4-year colleges.19
Questionnaire
The questionnaire assessed demo-
graphic and background characteris-
tics; tobacco, alcohol, and other sub-
stance use; satisfaction with education;
and students' interests and lifestyle
choices.16,17 To assess tobacco use, re-
spondents were asked if they had
smoked a cigarette, cigar, or pipe or
used smokeless tobacco. For each, re-
sponse options were "never used,"
"used, but not in the past 12 months,"
"used, but not in the past 30 days," or
"used in the past 30 days." Also as-
sessed were the number of days in the
past 30 days in which a student had
smoked cigarettes and cigars and the
age at which they first smoked these
products.
Data Analysis
For each tobacco product, all students
who reported any use were considered
tobeever(lifetime)users.Currentusers
were students who used the product in
the past 30 days. Past-year users
reportedhavingusedtheproductinthe
past year. Total tobacco use included
cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco,
and pipes. Binge drinking was defined
as drinking 5 or more drinks in a row
for men and 4 or more drinks in a row
for women during the previous 2
weeks.20 Current marijuana users were
students who had smoked marijuana in
the past 30 days. Other illicit drug use
wasnotincludedintheanalysis,because
current use rates were very low.

Statisticalanalyseswerecarriedoutus-
ing SAS statistical software (SAS Insti-
tute Inc, Cary, NC). Univariate analy-
ses identified student-level and college-
level characteristics associated with
current cigar, cigarette, smokeless to-
bacco, and total tobacco use. Sociode-
mographicfactorsincludedage,sex,eth-
nicity, year in school, marital status, and
highest parental educational attain-
ment(aproxyforsocioeconomicstatus).
Other student-level variables included
current marijuana use, binge drinking,
grade point average, a single-item mea-
sure of satisfaction with education, an
item assessing the importance to a stu-
dent of participating in 9 activities (eg,
athletics, academic work, fraternity or
sorority life, parties, and religion), and
an item measuring the number of hours
per week a student spent on 8 activities
(eg,playingintercollegiatesports,study-
ing, socializing with friends). College-
level factors included geographic loca-
tion (West, South, North Central, and
Northeast), campus location (rural or
small town vs urban or suburban), size
of enrollment (5000, 5000-10000, or
10000), public vs private status, reli-
gious affiliation, coeducational vs all-
female, competitiveness for admission
(based on percentage of applicants ac-
cepted), commuter vs noncommuter
school, and survey response rate.
Student-level and college-level fac-
tors that were significantly associated
with cigar, cigarette, smokeless to-
bacco, and total tobacco use in the uni-
variate analysis (P.001) were in-
cluded in multiple logistic regression
models. Separate models were built for
cigar, cigarette, smokeless tobacco, and
total tobacco use. Current use was the
outcome variable for all models. All
multivariate models included sex, eth-
nicity, year in school, marital status, and
highest parental educational attain-
ment. Two-way interaction terms of
these factors with sex were included in
the initial model, and those with sta-
tistical significance were retained in the
final model. Year in school was used in
place of age to examine the effect of du-
ration of exposure to the college envi-
ronment. Results do not differ when age
is substituted in the models. Adjusted
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confi-
dence intervals are reported. The final
logistic regression model was fitted by
the Generalized Estimating Equations
approach,21,22 with the independent
working correlation, to make more ro-
bust inference using clustered out-
comes due to our sampling scheme.
Odds ratios obtained from the Gener-
alized Estimating Equations method
were almost identical with those from
ordinarylogisticregression,whereasthe
SEs of ORs associated with the college
characteristics were slightly larger. The
Generalized Estimating EquationsÂ­
based results are reported herein.
RESULTS
Prevalence of Tobacco Use
More than 60% of college students have
tried a tobacco product, nearly half used
tobacco in the past year, and one third
used tobacco in the past month
(TABLE 1). Cigarettes account for most
of the tobacco use. More than half of
college students (53.4%) have smoked
a cigarette, 38.1% did so in the past year,
and 28.5% were current (past 30-day)
cigarette smokers. Among current
smokers, 32.0% smoke less than 1 ciga-
rette per day, 43.6% smoke 1 to 10 ciga-
rettes per day, and only 12.8% smoke
1 or more pack per day. Current, past-
year, and lifetime cigarette smoking
rates in this college sample did not
change between 1997 and 1999.6
Total tobacco use is higher among
men than women (Table 1). More than
half of men (53.0%) and 41.3% of
women have used tobacco in the past
year, whereas 37.9% of men and 29.7%
ofwomenarecurrenttobaccousers.The
sex difference in total tobacco use is en-
tirely attributable to a higher preva-
lenceofnoncigarettetobaccouseamong
men, because men and women have
nearly identical cigarette smoking rates.
Cigar smoking accounts for the larg-
est share of noncigarette tobacco use
(Table 1). More than one third of col-
lege students have ever smoked a ci-
gar, including more than half of the men
and one quarter of the women. Nearly
1 in 4 college students smoked a cigar
in the past year, and 8.5% smoked a ci-
gar in the past month. Most cigar use
is occasional: less than 1% of current
(past 30-day) cigar users smoked daily,
and 89.7% smoked a cigar on fewer than
5 of the past 30 days. Smokeless to-
bacco use is much less prevalent than
cigarette or cigar smoking. Pipe smok-
ing is rare.

The use of cigarettes, smokeless to-
bacco, and all products combined is
more common in non-Hispanic whites
than in Hispanics, blacks, or Asians
(TABLE 2). In contrast, the prevalence
of cigar use is similar in whites and
blacks (9.2% vs 8.1%) but lower in His-
panics and Asians. Cigar smoking is ac-
tually more prevalent among black
women than white women (6.8% vs
4.0%, P=.003), whereas a reverse rela-
tionship exists for men (10.9% vs
17.2%, P=.008). This finding should be
interpreted with caution because re-
sults for blacks are based on a small
sample and need confirmation.
Combinations of Tobacco Products
Most college students who have used
tobacco used more than 1 product.
Among tobacco users, 51.3% used more
than 1 tobacco product in the past year
(36.3% used 2 tobacco products, 14.4%
used 3 products, and 0.6% used all 4
products). The most frequent combi-
nations were cigarettes and cigars
(19.7%), cigarettes and pipes (12.0%),
and cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless to-
bacco (6%). In contrast, 77.5% of cur-
rent tobacco use was restricted to a
single product. Among current users,
the most frequent combination was ci-
gars and cigarettes.
Men used multiple tobacco prod-
ucts more often than women; 58.2% of
men vs 27.5% of women had used more
than 1 tobacco product in the past year
(P.001), whereas 37.1% of men but
only 10.6% of women had used more
than 1 tobacco product in the past
month (P.001). The combination of
cigarettes and cigars accounts for nearly
all multiple tobacco product use in
women and is by far the most frequent
combination among men.
Noncigarette tobacco use occurs
more often in combination with ciga-
rette use than in isolation. Among cur-
rent cigar smokers, 33.4% smoked only
cigars, whereas 61.4% smoked both ci-
gars and cigarettes. Of current smoke-
less tobacco users, 30.6% used only
smokeless tobacco, whereas 62.3% also
smoked cigarettes.
Age of First Tobacco Use
The median age of first cigarette use was
14 years for both sexes. The median age
of first cigar use was 17 years for men
and 18 years for women. However,
26.8% of cigar smokers (33.3% of
women and 21.9% of men) had their
first cigar at 19 years or older, when
they were presumably in college.
Among 5262 respondents who had ever
used both cigars and cigarettes, 63.8%
had smoked a cigarette at a younger age
than they had smoked a cigar, 27.3%
had started both at the same age, and
only 8.9% had used cigars at a younger
age than cigarettes.
Correlates of Tobacco Use
TABLE 3 displays the multivariate analy-
sesexaminingstudent-levelandcollege-
level sociodemographic factors associ-
ated with current use of all tobacco
products. TABLE 4 displays the result
of a similar analysis focused on stu-
dent behaviors and lifestyles. Total to-
bacco use is significantly (P.05)
linked with sex, ethnicity, marital sta-
tus, other substance use, high-risk be-
haviors, and certain college lifestyles.
Male and white students are more likely
to use tobacco than female and non-
white students (Table 3). Students who
use tobacco are also more likely to
smoke marijuana, binge drink, have
more sexual partners, have lower
grades, rate parties as important, and
spend more time socializing with
friends (Table 4). Tobacco users are less
likely than nonusers to rate athletics or
religion as important and to be satis-
fied with their education. Total to-
bacco use is not related to parental edu-
cational attainment. The only college-
level factor associated with tobacco use
is geographic location. Tobacco use is
lower in western colleges (Table 3). Ex-
cept for sex, these same factors are also
independently associated with cur-
rent cigarette smoking.
Cigar smokers differ from cigarette
smokers in several ways. Men are far
more likely than women to smoke ci-
gars. Blacks are as likely to smoke ci-
gars as are whites. Like cigarette smok-
ing, current cigar use is associated with
the use of other tobacco products and
other substances (alcohol and mari-
juana) and is more common among stu-
dents who express strong interest in
parties. Unlike cigarettes, cigars are also

more often used by students who rate
fraternities and sororities and attend-
ing sporting events as important.
Smokeless tobacco use also has dis-
tinctive features. It has the strongest as-
sociation with male sex and white race
of all tobacco products. Unlike ciga-
rettes, it is just as common in the West
as in other areas, and there is a trend
toward greater use by students en-
rolled in colleges in rural areas or small
towns. Unlike cigarettes, smokeless to-
bacco use is more common among in-
tercollegiate athletes.
COMMENT
This study contains several new find-
ings. It demonstrates that tobacco use
among college students is more preva-
lent than previously appreciated, be-
cause tobacco use is not limited to ciga-
rettes. Cigar smoking is substantial, and
smokeless tobacco (and, rarely, pipes)
are also used. Most tobacco users use
more than 1 tobacco product, with ci-
gars and cigarettes being the most com-
mon combination. Because men are
more likely than women to use non-
cigarette tobacco products, overall to-
bacco use rates are higher in men than
women, despite identical rates of ciga-
rette smoking. Whether the gap be-
tween the sexes in noncigarette to-
bacco product use will follow the
pattern of cigarettes and narrow in the
future deserves to be monitored. In the
meantime, these data indicate that as-
sessments limited to cigarette smok-
ing will underestimate the level of to-
bacco use in the college population,
especially among men. This study also
reports some good news. Cigarette use
by college students, which increased
dramatically between 1993 and 1997,6
stabilized between 1997 and 1999. Our
previous work suggested college is a
time of considerable flux in cigarette
smoking.6 Thisarticleextendsthatwork
to show that college students are ex-
perimenting with the full range of to-
bacco products and that this is occur-
ring across all types of colleges. College
students who use tobacco share many
characteristics. They are more likely to
be white, single, and experimenting
with other risky behaviors, such as
binge drinking, using marijuana, and
having more sexual partners. Tobacco
use also appears to be part of a college
lifestyle that values social life over edu-
cational achievement, athletic partici-
pation, or religion. A similar pattern was
observed in an analysis of predictors of
cigarette use in the 1993 version of this
survey.23 Although many of the same
characteristics identify students who are
likely to use any tobacco product, this
article demonstrates that there are dis-
tinctive patterns of cigar and smoke-
less tobacco use that distinguish their
users from cigarette smokers.
Cigar smoking in the United States
was primarily a behavior of older men
until the early 1990s.9 Few young
adults and few women smoked cigars.
Our data demonstrate how much this
pattern has changed. Cigar use is now
common among college students.
Although it remains much more com-
mon among men than women, an
unprecedented number of female col-

COLLEGE STUDENTS' USE OF TOBACCO

lege students now smoke cigars. Cigar
use patterns had other unique fea-
tures. First, cigar use by freshmen and
sophomores exceeds that of juniors
and seniors. This pattern was not
observed for other tobacco products
and was contrary to our expectation
that cigar smoking rates would
increase with more years of exposure
to college. It suggests that the cigar
use is a new phenomenon entering
the college population. College stu-
dent cigar use may increase in the
future, as the cohort of juniors and
seniors progresses through college
and is joined by adolescents in whom
cigar use is already high.1,13-15 A sec-
ond unexpected feature was the
higher rate of cigar smoking by black
students. This is in sharp contrast to
black students' lower rate of all other
tobacco product use. This preliminary
finding needs confirmation in future
work with larger samples. College
students who use smokeless tobacco
have their own distinctive features.
They are predominantly white men
who attend schools in rural areas,
thereby fitting the pattern of smoke-
less tobacco use in the broader popu-
lation.24 Intercollegiate athletes, in
whom cigarette smoking rates are
low, are more likely to use smokeless
tobacco, perhaps as a substitute form
of nicotine.
Although the prevalence of tobacco
use by college students is high, the in-
tensity of their tobacco use is low. One
third of cigarette smokers and 99% of
cigar smokers do not smoke every day.
Even this low level of use is a cause for
concern. Low levels of tobacco expo-
sure for many years can produce sub-
stantial morbidity and mortality, as re-
search on passive smoking shows.25
More important, the intermittent use of
cigars, smokeless tobacco, or ciga-
rettes repeatedly exposes a user to nico-
tine, a drug capable of producing physi-
cal dependence. Low levels of nicotine
exposure during college might evolve
later into nicotine dependence and daily
cigarette smoking. Our data do not sug-
gest that cigars act as a gateway to ciga-
rette use in college students, since only
9% of cigar and cigarette users smoked
cigars first, but this issue deserves fur-
ther study. Cigar or smokeless to-
bacco use might also contribute to the
persistence of tobacco use in former
cigarette smokers and thereby facili-
tate a return to cigarette smoking. Ci-
gar smoking among college students
may diffuse to other segments of the
population, especially to children or
adolescents, because of the effect of peer
modeling. The visibility of tobacco
products on campus, even if used in-
termittently, sends a dangerous mes-
sage about the social acceptability of to-
bacco use. The broad use of tobacco

COLLEGE STUDENTS' USE OF TOBACCO

24-year-olds could portend a future in-
crease in overall adult tobacco use.
The results of this study must be
viewed within the context of its limi-
tations. One potential limitation is non-
response bias. Although the survey re-
sponse rate was 60%, the prevalence of
cigarette smoking did not differ be-
tween respondents and a sample of non-
respondents, and there was no corre-
lation between smoking rates and
response rates at individual schools. We
attempted to control for potential bias
by including college response rate as an
independent variable in multivariate
analyses. Students' self-report was our
measure of tobacco use. Biochemical
measures have established the validity
of relying on self-reported smoking sta-
tus in national surveys.26,27 Underre-
porting of smoking status is probably
even less likely in this survey, which fo-
cused on alcohol rather than tobacco.
College students comprise the larg-
est group of Americans aged 18 to 24
years. This is the youngest age group
that tobacco manufacturers can le-
gally target for marketing efforts. The
college years are a crucial period in the
development or abandonment of smok-
ing behavior.6 Tobacco use in this group
should be monitored closely, and young
adults should be included in all to-
bacco control efforts.
Colleges offer a potential site for
interventions to discourage tobacco
use. These efforts clearly need to
broaden beyond cigarettes to address
the use of cigars and smokeless
tobacco. Colleges' alcohol and sub-
stance use prevention and treatment
programs should address tobacco,
because use patterns are so highly cor-
related. Data from this study can help
colleges target interventions to the stu-
dents at greatest risk of using specific
tobacco products. These efforts should
be accompanied by environmental
and policy changes that discourage
tobacco use and reinforce the message
that nonsmoking is the norm. One key
component is to make college build-
ings, including dormitories and living
quarters, smoke free. This policy pro-
tects nonsmokers from passive smoke
exposure and protects all students
from the fire hazard of tobacco use in
dormitories. It also limits the visibility
and accessibility of tobacco products
and may discourage initiation, help
keep occasional smokers from becom-
ing regular users, and boost the suc-
cess of smokers who are trying to quit.
Reducing tobacco use of all types
among young adults should be a
national health priority.
