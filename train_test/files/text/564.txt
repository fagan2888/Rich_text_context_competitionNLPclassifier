Abstract: This paper will highlight current evidence about health and well-being that could encourage
investment in health for older populations. The paper uses the example of hypertension throughout to illustrate
how data collection efforts are translating research to policy. Hypertension, is a global scourge for poor and
wealthy, younger and older adults, increasing the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. Although it is easily
diagnosed and can be effectively treated the burden of hypertension continues to grow as awareness, prevention
and treatment lags, particularly for the poor and old. The focus is brought back to how current research can
inform policy for ageing populations in the final section, using Ireland's experience to demonstrate how to
legislate the good life for older adults.

Introduction
The world is in unprecedented demographic territory
with global ageing, currently numbering 900 million
adults aged 60 years or older and doubling to 1.8
billion by the year 2042 (UN Pop Div 2015), within a
current total population of 7 billion and counting
(Bloom 2011). Those that are already older (over 900
million people), are living longer ­ with average
life expectancy at age 60 projected to increase from
20.2 years today, to 22.8 years over this same time
period (UN Pop Div 2015). The astonishing projected
growth in the number and proportion of the older
adult population worldwide requires an equally
extraordinary policy response ­ one that should be
informed by ageing research. To this end, given the
popular media excitement about the new research
frontiers presented by "Big Data", one might think
the issue of limited data to inform health policy and
prepare for an ageing world mooted (Borgman 2015).
Yet the limits to currently available data become ever
more evident when examining two ongoing scientific
debates about our ageing world: whether or not limits
to human life span exist, and whether healthy life
expectancy will keep pace with increasing average
life expectancy (Oeppen & Vaupel, 2002; Olshansky
et al., 2007, Sanderson & Scherbov, 2010; Lee, 2011).
While the demographic data are robust, the lack of
epidemiological data to resolve crucial ageing-related
questions is profound. These fundamental unknowns
about the health of ageing populations have practical
implications, as poor health among the growing
number of older adults will reduce their social and
economic participation, and have real and significant
costs for health and pension systems.
In today's currency, demographic change is
inexorably linked to development, bolstering the case
that people do matter to economics (Schumacher 1973;
Sachs 2015). And the economics of an ageing world
continues to evolve as this unprecedented population
horizon forces shifts in thinking about existing social
pacts. This new social settlement needs to take on
well-being, health and social justice for all (Stiglitz et
al., 2012; nef 2015), and to recognise that investments
in health can have widespread and equitable social
returns (Suhrcke et al., 2006; Fried & Paccaud
2010; Seychell 2015). While older adults are surely
continuing to make considerable social, economic,
and cultural contributions to society, this is somewhat
dependent on how well we age. How well we age is

highly dependent on health policies that benefit all,
older and younger, over a lifetime (Beard et al., 2015).
Alongside demographic ageing, the world is also
undergoing an epidemiological transition as non-
communicable diseases (NCD) add to, and already
outweigh in some countries, the burden of infectious
diseases. Ageing is a major driver in the leading
causes of NCD burden, even while the majority of
community dwelling older adults are likely to age
without considerable disease or disability, and remain
economically and socially active. Large variations exist
withinandacrosscountries,atalllevelsofdevelopment,
but universally, individuals at the lower income levels
are at higher risk of disease and disability, with greater
need for health care, long-term care, social care and
pensions. Global NCD burden is increasing, with
rapid rise in incidence and prevalence in lower middle
income countries (LMICs), and particularly among the
poorest people (Hotez & Peiperl 2015). The prevention
of NCDs is therefore a global priority, with needs for
better understanding of the patterns and determinants
of health and well-being, effective prevention
strategies, and evolution of evidence-based policies
to ensure the extra years lived are quality years. Even
with major improvements in the prevention of common
chronic conditions, the increase in the numbers of
older people will likely result in greater disease burden.
Without concerted efforts to decrease the incidence of
these conditions, at current health levels or worsening
health in successive cohorts of ageing adults, the
burden will be even greater. Moreover, given that the
largest proportion (66%) of older persons reside in
low and middle income countries (LMICs), the largest
proportion of NCD deaths and burden are in LMICs (UN
Pop Div 2015; Vos et al., 2015).
This paper will highlight current evidence about
healthandwell-beingthatcouldencourageinvestment
in health for older populations. The paper uses the
example of hypertension throughout to illustrate
how data collection efforts are translating research
to policy. Hypertension, is a global scourge for poor
and wealthy, younger and older adults, increasing the
risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. Although
it is easily diagnosed and can be effectively treated
the burden of hypertension continues to grow as
awareness,preventionandtreatmentlags,particularly
for the poor and old (Olsen & Spencer 2015). The focus
is brought back to how current research can inform
policy for ageing populations in the final section,
using Ireland's experience to demonstrate how to
legislate the good life for older adults (Seaford 2011).
Research and policy to address
a silent killer
Hypertension is only second to diet as a leading
factor in death and morbidity worldwide, and
too often provides no warning signs or symptoms
(Bromfield & Muntner 2014, Forouzanfar et al., 2015).
Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure
140mg Hg or above and/or diastolic blood pressure
90mm Hg or above (World Health Organization 2013),
and is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease,
stroke, renal failure and congestive heart failure,
with significant impacts on premature mortality and
disability. Around 54% of stroke and 47% of ischaemic
heart disease can be attributed to hypertension as the
major risk factor (Lawes 2008). The burden of these
conditions is greater in LMICs than in higher income
settings, and continues to increase largely due to
undetected and uncontrolled hypertension. (World
Health Organization 2010).
The risk of hypertension increases with age, and
is associated with lifestyle factors such as unhealthy
diet, harmful use of alcohol, lack of physical activity,
excess weight and exposure to persistent stress.
Hypertension also frequently co-exists with other risk
factors such as smoking, obesity, high cholesterol and
diabeteswhichalsoincreasetherisksofcardiovascular
disease and other poor health outcomes for older
people (Fan et al., 2015). The risk of hypertension and
these other risk factors is also highest among people
with the lowest socio-economic status, even in high
income countries (Leng et al., 2015).
Hypertension is one of the most common risk
factors affecting older people, with prevalence
estimates ranging from 46% of adults aged 25 years
and over in Africa, to 35% in the Americas and 40%
in the rest of the world (Lozano et al 2011). High
systolic blood pressure was found to be the sixth
leading risk factor for morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa
(Forouzanfar, et al., 2015), and the African Union,
recently released the "Status Report on Hypertension
in Africa" acknowledging the need to share best
practices and policies, and for coordinated research
efforts (African Union 2013).
Results from the multi-country WHO Study on
global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) also showed
high rates of hypertension in adults aged 50 years
and older ranging from 78% in South Africa to 32% in
India, and with consistently higher levels for women
than for men (Kowal et al., 2012; Lloyd-Sherlock et al.,
70

2014). The proportion of hypertensive individuals who
were aware of their diagnosis ranged from a high of
72% in Russia to less than 45% in all other countries.
Moreover the proportion of people with hypertension
whose condition was effectively controlled was very
small, ranging from 4% in Ghana to 14% in India
(Lloyd-Sherlock et al., 2014).
These striking numbers can excite media
attention, spur impetus for action, and bolster
political will. Yet the reality of addressing the problem
is rather mundane, requiring difficult, multi-sectoral,
multi-pronged, coordinated approaches that must
go well beyond the ephemera of news headlines
and political slogans. In one example of a concerted
move to prevention, the South African government
has embarked on a strategy to reduce hypertension
through salt reduction legislation, and early detection
and treatment (Mail and Guardian 2014; Business
Day 2014). The South African Department of Health
is responsible for operationalising the framework
to address NCDs, including a reduction in the mean
population intake of salt to less than 5g per day by
2020, and a reduction in the prevalence of people
with raised blood pressure by 20%, by 2020, through
lifestyle and medication (Department of Health 2013).
To meet these health outcomes, South Africa opted for
a strategy that involves a combination of legislation
and public education, partnering with the Heart
and Stroke Foundation South Africa (Charlton et al.,
2014; Eksteen & Mungal-Singh 2015). Legislation will
take effect in 2016, with WHO SAGE in South Africa
(and Ghana for comparison) providing required data
to measure changes in hypertension and salt intake
(through interviews, measurements and 24 hour urine
capture) in Waves 2 (2015) and 3 (2017).
In China, which is a very large and rapidly ageing
country, hypertension prevalence in SAGE was 60%
in adults aged 50 years and older, with just 43%
aware they have high blood pressure (Lloyd-Sherlock
et al., 2014). Likewise among people in the Trial on
Community-based Screening in Beijing, 53% of people
aged 50 years and over had high blood pressure, and
30% of these people were not previously aware of
their condition (Jiang et al., 2014). In the China Health
and Retirement Longitudinal Study of adults aged 45
years or older, 38.6% had hypertension, more than
40% of these people were unaware they had high
blood pressure, and more than half of these were not
receiving treatment (Feng et al., 2014).
The World Health Organization is currently
working to support the Chinese government to reduce
the premature burden of NCDs and to address other
challenges of population ageing by taking a life-
course approach to health. The strategic approach is
to promote advocacy and multi-sectoral approaches to
address the social and lifestyle determinants of poor
health, and to provide technical and policy support
for an integrated package of health services for the
prevention and control of NCDs (China Ministry of
Health 2013).
Data from another large country, Indonesia, also
identify hypertension as a major problem confronting
ageing population. The prevalence of raised blood
pressure among adults aged 15 years and over in
Indonesiawas31.7%in2007,withsignificantvariations
across different economic groups (Ministry of Health
Indonesia 2008). This increase in hypertension
occurs in the context of rapid economic development,
urbanization and increased rates of poverty, and
widening inequity. In the Indonesian Family Life
Study, the prevalence of hypertension varied greatly
across geographical areas and socioeconomic strata.
The age-standardised prevalence of hypertension was
28.9% in the less socioeconomically advantaged group
and24.7%in the moreadvantagedgroup, with muchof
this inequality accounted for by different distributions
of body mass index (BMI) and education. Higher BMI
among the more advantaged group increased the
prevalence of hypertension in this group and reduced
the inequality (accounting for 18% of inequality),
whereas lower education among the less advantaged
group increased hypertension inequality (accounting
for 30% of inequality) (Christiani et al., 2016).
As in other countries, Indonesia has many
opportunities to improve the health of its ageing
population through control of NCDs and risk factors.
However effective health policy must necessarily
intersect with the policy and actions from other
government sectors, local governance structures,
and the influence of industry. The government has
introduced programs for universal access to health
services (Sparrow et al., 2013), and runs community-
based integrated health services for older people
(Pertiwi 2013). However, there is scope for expansion
of these programs and to increase their focus on NCD
risk factors (Christiani et al., paper accepted 2015).
Just next door to Indonesia, hypertension is one
of the most common chronic conditions affecting
older people in Australia. Figure 1 shows data from
the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health
(ALSWH) and demonstrates the increase in prevalence
of hypertension with age and across successive
71

generations (Byles et al., 2015). Risk of hypertension
among these women was strongly associated with
overweight and obesity, with greater physical activity
partially mitigating against effects of weight (Jackson
et al., 2014). The odds of developing hypertension
almost doubled among overweight women and more
than tripled among obese women compared to women
in the healthy weight range. However, the probability
of hypertension increases across the entire BMI
distribution, with increased risk not exclusive to the
overweight or obese group. A hypothetical one unit
change in the entire BMI distribution, where every
woman loses weight, was estimated to result in a
10.3% reduction in the proportion of women with
hypertension. In contrast, if BMI reduced by three
units in the top 20% of the distribution (BMI > 29) (that
is, only very overweight or obese women lose weight),
the corresponding reduction in incidence would be
only 7.3%. This analysis demonstrates the importance
of a whole-population strategy to disease prevention,
rather only attempting to achieve greater weight loss
among the most overweight (Brown et al., 2007). Of
concern, ALSWH shows a large increase in BMI across
successive generations suggesting large increases
in prevalence of hypertension, as well as significant
reduction in physical function due to disability
associated with obesity and related conditions such
as diabetes. To illustrate these effects, Figure 2 shows
the changes in physical functioning among three
ALSWH cohorts for women with diabetes, and the
significant reduction in their physical function scores.
As identified in the World Ageing Report 2015 (Beard
et al., 2015, p.7), public-health policy must be framed
to enable positive trajectories of ageing. Reducing risk
factors for NCD such as hypertension and diabetes
is critical to ensure optimal functional capacity and
well-being for older populations.
Approaches to management of
hypertension
Screening for high blood pressure is universally
recommended starting at age 18 years. Strong evidence
exists to support treating hypertensive persons aged
60 years or older to a blood pressure goal of less than
150/90 mm Hg (James et al., 2013; Cochrane 2015).
Rather unhelpfully though, recent treatment target

recommendations from the most recent iterations of
the European Society of Hypertension and European
Society of Cardiology differ from recommendations
by the American Society of Hypertension and the
International Society of Hypertension, and from those
of the 8th Joint National Committee (Lancet 2014). Even
with the current recommendation alignment issues,
very high level evidence exists indicating that treatment
of hypertension reduces the risk of adverse health
outcomes(WorldHealthOrganizationandInternational
Society of Hypertension Writing Group 2003 (WHO/
ISH 2003)). However, despite clear evidence of the
prevalence and impact of hypertension, and evidence
in support of screening and effective treatment, many
studies show that hypertension is underdiagnosed
and poorly treated in many populations around the
world. On World Health Day 2013, WHO called for all
adults around the world to have their blood pressure
measured (World Health Organization 2013). WHO has
also provided a number of evidence-based guidelines
on management of patients with hypertension through
integrated programmes even in resource-constrained
settings (World Health Organization 2007, World Health
Organization 2012).
These guidelines recognise that not all people with
high blood pressure require medications and some
may achieve sufficient reduction in blood pressure
from lifestyle changes, including improved diet and
exercise, and reduced alcohol intake as recommended
for all patients with hypertension (WHO/ISH 2003).
Weight loss and physical activity will also reduce risk
of diabetes, and cessation of smoking will reduce risk
of cardiovascular disease. For people who require
additional treatment to control blood pressure,
recommendations are available for medications.
Medical management of hypertension does not
normally require specialist medical care. A review
and meta-analysis of studies on the effectiveness
of community interventions for hypertension
management in China indicated that community-
based care for hypertension care is very effective.
Interventions were provided by primary care workers
(general practitioners, village doctors, or nurses), and
included education directed toward patients, training
of care providers, organizational changes, frequent
monitoring, patient self-management, and family
support (Lu et al., 2012). Importantly, the management
of hypertension should not be seen in isolation from

an individual's other health and social needs. Many
older people will have multiple risk factors, multiple
conditions and functional limitations. Effective
health care therefore requires integration of health
care and social services to meet the multiple needs of
the older person and their carers, within their social
context. There is a large body of evidence in support
of integrated care programs to improve the quality
of care and achieve better patient satisfaction and
clinical outcomes (Nolte & Pitchforth 2014). This
person-centred approach to care typically features
a non-specialist case manager who coordinates care
with primary care physicians and specialists (Patel &
Chatterji 2015). This team approach also maximizes
system efficiencies and dovetails with universal health
coverage for noncommunicable diseases. While a
number of research gaps remain, sufficient evidence
exists for policy makers to immediately implement
blood pressure screening and control across all
primary care platforms.
Policy development for
management of hypertension
­ examples from Ghana and
ASEAN
Fifty-seven percent of older adults in Ghana were
found by objective measurement to have high blood
pressure in 2010 (SAGE-Ghana), yet only 23% of
the respondents were aware of their condition and
4% were effectively treated (Lloyd-Sherlock et al.,
2014). These figures opened the door for negotiations
with the Ministry of Health and hypertension was
identified as a key priority for multi-sector ageing
policy development in Ghana (de Carvalho et al.,
2015). This problem exists despite the establishment
of the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda
2010-2013, with a focus on screening and management
of hypertension by local health services (National
Development Planning Commission, Republic of
Ghana 2010), suggesting other barriers such as low
levels of health insurance and poor access to health
care may exacerbate the problem of underdiagnosis
and undertreatment (Bosu 2010). These access
problems exist despite the introduction of the Ghana
National Health Insurance Scheme in 2006 that should
reduce financial barriers to treatment, with insurance
coverage rates for this age group remaining below 50%
(World Health Organization 2014a). Having health
insurance was positively associated with awareness in
three countries, but the strength of this effect varied
from very strong in the Russian Federation to more
marginal in Ghana (Lloyd-Sherlock et al., 2014). Other
studies also suggest that the low insurance coverage
and poor control of this highly prevalent condition
may be at least partly explained by a lack of awareness
of the nature of chronic disease and the need for long-
term treatment that may have no impact on symptoms
(Addo et al., 2010). The problem of hypertension
in Ghana is potentially not only a consequence of
limited access to services and drugs, but also heavily
influenced by older people's limited understanding
of the nature of chronic disease, risk factors, and the
need for ongoing use of preventive medications. In
other words, the challenge may be as much related to
demand as supply, and any policy response needed to
take this into account.
In response to these needs, the government of
Ghana determined to increase community awareness
of the health needs of older adults, integrate ageing
and health into the community health workers
programme, and improve insurance coverage and
uptake of services. These recommendations have been
taken up in Ghana's Medium Term Health Strategy for
2014-2017, with particular objectives to bridge equity
gaps in access to health services, and to intensify
prevention and control of NCDs (Ministry of Health,
Republic of Ghana 2014).
Moving from individual countries, to regions and
the benefits gained from cross-country comparisons,
member countries of the Association of South-East
Asian Nations (ASEAN) have initiated a range of
responses to NCD management and control. A review
of these responses found that there is a need to
re-examine the fundamental nature of health services,
and to create innovative solutions to considerable
challenges, including a lack of skilled staff, scarcity of
equipment and medicines, and difficulties with access
to facilities (Lim et al., 2014). Twelve case studies
illustrate a variety of approaches, including a focus on
lifestyle changes in Thailand, to enactment of a "sin
tax" in the Philippines. This same review included
a description of a community-based hypertension
management programme in Viet Nam, which based
its success on engagement of the whole community,
support from local authorities, strategic utilization of
medical expertise, and the commitment of health care
workers. Where reliable data from informed research
and political will combine to produce evidence-based
policy making, attention paid to both national and

regional solutions offers considerable potential to
reinvent ageing (Ferreira 2005; Olshansky et al., 2007).
Review of strategies on ageing
The wheel need not be recreated in each country and
for each renewal of policy commitments, but rather,
can be informed by the efforts of other national
jurisdictions and international fora, and tailored to
country realities. In all cases, a solid research base
is required as basic minimum input for policy and
planning reformation: the ongoing challenge is to
provide data that feeds into the policy process. A
positive example from a high income country is
provided by Ireland, where the high prevalence
of hypertension (64%) and relatively low levels of
awareness (55%) in Irish adults aged 50 years and
older poses a major public health challenge (Murphy et
al., 2014). The Irish National Positive Ageing Strategy
was developed with broad domestic input and
embedded within the Government's Healthy Ireland
framework, under the responsibility of the Minister
of State (Department of Health 2013). This strategy
was informed by policy efforts from no less than eight
countries as well as their own previous work on policy
development (Department of Health 2014). Data
from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA)
has been a crucial element to the ongoing policy
developments and monitoring through the Annual
Positive Ageing Forum convened by the Department of
Health (Department of Health 2014; Nolan et al. 2014).
This illustrates how research can be readily translated
into policy, given the political commitment to do so.
Need for ongoing monitoring
and evaluation platforms
Population ageing brings new challenges to health
policy and health systems to help people maintain
their health as they age, to improve their quality of life
and their opportunities to participate in their societies,
and to reduce burdens on health and welfare systems.
Theavailability of data to inform the responses to these
challenges is of fundamental importance, and this
review has provided examples where the availability
population data on hypertension has elevated the
importance of this problem and driven changes to
policy. However, if these responses are to be effective,
mechanisms are needed for rapid collection and
analysis of disaggregated data to monitor health
trends, system effectiveness, and emerging areas of
inequity (WHO 2014b).
Conclusion
New health horizons are dependent on when and how
"Big" and "Little" data are translated into action for
the well-being of individuals, including to address
the scourge of hypertension across most countries.
The public health reality is that in many cases, data
availability, access and utilization in many contexts
remains an issue. WHO's Study on global AGEing and
adult health (www.who.int/healthinfo/sage; Kowal et
al., 2012) is proving to be a valuable tool for research
and policy in a number of countries, although more
funding and a wider range of countries are needed to
ensure more proactive and timely inputs into policy
and practice. Considerable investment is needed to
manage and exploit data now and in the future, so
that policy makers informed by an evidence base can
act proactively to promote well-being in 900 million
older adults and counting.
