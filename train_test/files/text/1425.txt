BACKGROUND: Con¯icting research ®ndings have created uncertainty as to the ideal body weight.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether average-adulthood BMI (body mass index, weight in kilograms per height in meters squared) is a
more reliable predictor of mortality risk than the one-time baseline BMI measurement which has been used in previous studies.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with a 20 y follow-up period, the First National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES 1)
Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS).
SUBJECTS: A random probability sample of 14 407 adults aged 25±74 y in the 1971±1975 NHANES 1.
MEASUREMENTS: Body-weight data were derived from measurements in the 1971±1975 and 1982±1984 NHEFS surveys, and
current and recalled estimates by subjects in the 1971±1975, 1982±1984, 1986 and 1987 surveys. Height was measured in the
1971±1975 survey. Socio-economic and lifestyle covariates were derived from questionnaires administered in all four surveys.
Almost all deaths were veri®ed by death certi®cates.
RESULTS: The shape of the morality risk vs baseline BMI curve varied due to a bias (late-life bias) caused by a steep decrease in
BMI among the elderly toward the end of the lifespan. In a particular analysis, the portion of subjects at baseline who were
deceased elderly with lower BMI than age-matched censored subjects indicated the size of the bias, and appeared to be the
proximate cause. Strong evidence was found to support the proximate cause being the actual cause. Excluding deaths during
early follow-up was only able to remove the late-life bias in limited circumstances. Using average-adulthood BMI as mortality
predictor and baseline BMI as covariate was very effective in removing the late-life bias. It also appeared to remove the reverse-
causation and regression-dilution biases, and yielded robustly positive mortality risk vs average-adulthood BMI curves in all
analyses in which it was tested.
CONCLUSIONS: Average-adulthood BMI appears to be an appropriate predictor of mortality risk, provided baseline BMI is used
as a covariate. Among non-elderly persons, being leaner meant a lower mortality risk, down to the lowest category of leanness in
the study Ð ` 20 kgam2. Future survival analyses of the mortality±BMI relationship should account for the effects of the
regression-dilution, reverse-causation and late-life biases.

Introduction
Previous studies of the follow-up mortality risk vs baseline
BMI (body mass index, weight in kilograms per height in
meters squared) relationship have yielded con¯icting
results,1±4 even though most of them excluded deaths
during the ®rst few years of follow-up, to remove the
reverse-causation bias.
Body weight has been shown to vary non-linearly with
age,5±7 consequently a one-time BMI measurement at base-
line is probably an unreliable measure of average BMI
throughout the lifespan. Conceptually, average-adulthood
BMI is the appropriate predictor of mortality risk, because
major killer diseases such as cardiovascular disease develop
throughout adulthood. Also, using average-adulthood BMI
should remove the regression-dilution bias,8,9 which most
previous studies have not done.
The objective of the present study was to develop a valid
measure of average-adulthood BMI using the longitudinal
body-weight data in the 20 y First National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up

Study (NHEFS), and to assess the effects of both baseline BMI
and average-adulthood BMI on mortality risk.
Methods
NHEFS
NHEFS is a longitudinal study of the persons aged 25±74 y
(n  14 407) examined in 1971±1975 in the ®rst National
Health and Examination Survey (NHANES I), a probability-
sample survey of the civilian United-States noninstitutiona-
lized population.10,11 NHEFS contains a series or follow-up
surveys,12,13 four of which have been completed. The ®rst
survey, the second conducted in 1982±1984, the third in
1987, and fourth in 1992, included the entire NHEFS cohort.
The second, in 1986, only included NHEFS subjects who
were 55±74 y of age in 1971±1975.
Predictor variables and their accuracy
Baseline BMIs were calculated for 1971±1975, 1982±1984,
1986 and 1987, using the 1971±1975 and 1982±1984 mea-
sured weights, and the 1986 and 1987 current weight
estimates,13 respectively. The 1982±1984 current estimates
were an average of 0.83 lb (0.37 kg), 0.46%, lower than the
1982±1984 measured values, and the estimate-measurement
correlation was high (Spearman's rho  0.98), suggesting
that the 1986 and 1987 baseline BMI data were highly
accurate.
Average-adulthood BMIs were calculated for 1971±1975,
1982±1984, 1986 and 1987, using the 1971±1975 and 1982±
1984 measurements, 1986 and 1987 current estimates and
recalled estimates.13 Recalled estimates were used because
Perry et al14 found that the l982±1984 10 y recalled esti-
mates of weights at age 25, 40 and 65 seemed accurate in
that they were strongly correlated with their 1971±1975
measured values (Spearman's rho  0.73). Two steps were
taken to help ensure accurate average-adulthood BMI data:
(1) obvious outliers were excluded; and (2) an internal-
validity test was conducted. This test involved assessing
agreement between average-adulthood BMIs calculated via
two different methods. Both methods used all measured
and currently estimated weights. The 1971±1975 recalled
estimates of maximum and minimum weights, and ages at
maximum and minimum weights, were used in the ®rst
method. Outlier subjects were those with grossly inaccurate
estimates, such as estimated maximum weight being less
than measured 1971±1975 weight by more than 10% of
measured weight. The 1982±1984 recalled estimates of
weight at 25, 40 and 65 y of age were used in the second
method. Outlier subjects were those with current estimate
of 1982±1984 weight not within 5% of measured value. The
two sets of average-adulthood BMIs were highly correlated
(Spearman's rho  0.85 for 1971±1975, 0.94 for 1982±1984,
0.91 for 1986, and 0.95 for 1987), and showed little differ-
ence in value (1.33% for 1971±1975, 0.26% for 1982±1984,
1.20% for 1986, and 0.11% for 1987). This suggested that
they were accurate enough for assessing the shape of the
mortality risk vs average-adulthood BMI curve.
All average-adulthood BMIs used here were calculated
using the ®rst method, because the second method did not
yield data for subjects who died before 1982±1984.
BMIs were calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
1971±1975 measured height in meters squared.
End points
Each death was con®rmed either by death certi®cate or
proxy interview.13 Death certi®cates were obtained for a
high proportion of subjects. For instance, in the 1992
survey certi®cates were obtained for 98.7% of subjects
known to have died since previous contact.13 Cause of
death was determined from the death certi®cate, and
coded using International Classi®cation of Diseases, Ninth
Revision (ICD-9)15 categories.
For Cox's regression analyses, all-cause mortality included
all deaths not due to motor-vehicle accidents (ICD-9 codes
E810±E825), other accidents (E800±E807, E826±E949), sui-
cide (E950±E959), homicide and legal interventions (E960±
E978), and all other external causes (E980±E999).
Covariates
The following covariates, derived from subjects' responses to
survey questions, were used in all Cox's regression analyses:
gender; race (white, African-American and other); educa-
tional level (continuous, 35 levels); per-capita income (con-
tinuous, family income divided by number of household
members); smoking (never smoker, former smoker, currently
smokes ` 1 packaday, currently smokes  1 packaday); alco-
hol consumption (` 12 drinksay, monthly, weekly, daily);
physical activity (®ve categories, based on subjects' esti-
mates of intensity of usual daily activities and recreational
activity).
Statistical methods
The t-test for independent samples, adjusted for unequal
variances where necessary, was used to assess the signi®cance
of differences between deceased and censored (survived or
lost to follow-up) subjects in baseline BMI, shown by means
of asterisks in Figure 2.
Cox's proportional-hazards regression analysisl6 was used
to analyze the simultaneous multivariate relationships
between mortality risk and baseline BMI and average-adult-
hood BMI, after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle
covariates. Cumulative hazard plots provided no evidence
against proportionality assumptions. The Wald statistic for
the B coef®cient for the continuous version of BMI as
predictor variable was used as a test of the direction and
signi®cance of the trend between adjusted mortality risk and
BMI, reported in Figures 1 and 5, and the likelihood-ratio test
was used to assess goodness of ®t of regression models17. For
all regression models containing both average-adulthood

BMI and baseline BMI (Figure 5), the Tolerance Statistic18 was
found to be greater than 0.30, and the Pearson's correlation
coef®cient between these two variables was found to be less
than 0.84, indicating no multicollinearity effects. Tests of
signi®cance were two sided, and used the 5% level.
Results
Table 1 presents 1971±1975 characteristics for all 14 407
NHEFS subjects, and subjects at the 1971±1975 and 1986
surveys who were in the Cox's regression analyses presented
below.
Figure 1 presents the result of Cox's regression analyses of
the relationship between all-cause mortality risk and base-
line BMI. The ®rst and second, 1971±1975, 14±20 and 1971±
1975, 0±20, both used 1971±1975 as baseline. The ®rst used
the 20 y NHEFS follow-up period with deaths during the ®rst
14 y excluded, whereas no deaths were excluded in the
second. The third, 1986, 0±6, used the 1986 survey as base-
line and a 6 y follow up, with no deaths excluded. Figure 1
shows that the mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve had a
variety of shapes in NHEFS, depending on baseline, follow-
up period, and whether early deaths were excluded. The
1971±1975, 14±20 mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve was
positive, the l971±1975, 0±20 curve was J-shaped, and 1986,
0±6 curve was negative. This is consonant with the variety of
such shapes found in follow-up studies.1±4
Figure 2, a plot of longitudinal BMI data vs age, by survival
status, was made using the 1971±1975 and 1982±1984
weight measurements, and 1986, 1987 and 1992 current
weight estimates for subjects with a 1982±1984 weight esti-
mate within 5% of measured value. Each BMI datum was
assigned to its 5 y age category, and the mean for each
category was plotted in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows that the
BMI vs age curve was curvilinear, and a different shape for
deceased than censored subjects.
Figures 1 and 2 suggested the existence of a bias, referred
to here as the late-life bias, caused by the decrease in BMI
among the elderly toward the end of the lifespan (Figure 2).
Conceptually this bias results if subjects are mixed-age adults

with a sizeable portion of elderly subjects at baseline, because
the late-life inverse relationship between mortality risk and
baseline BMI, when BMI is low and mortality is high (Figure
2), appears artifactually to apply to all subjects in the study.
Regression models traditionally used in Cox's regression
analyses of the mortality risk vs baseline BMI relationship
do not adequately account for this complex interaction
between mortality, BMI and age in late life, and hence do
not remove this bias. In a particular survival analysis, it was
the portion of subjects at baseline who were deceased elderly
subjects with lower BMI than age-matched censored subjects
which indicated the size of the bias. This is referred to as the
proximate cause. Figure 3 shows the size of the proximate
cause in the analyses reported here. The proximate cause was
essentially nonexistent for the 1971±1975, 14±20 analysis
because average baseline BMI was higher for deceased than
censored subjects at all ages (Figure 3A), and this analysis
yielded no bias (positive mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve
in Figure 1A). The proximate cause was relatively small for
the 1971±1975, 0±20 analysis, because average baseline BMI
was lower for deceased than censored subjects for a relatively
small portion of subjects at baseline, those over the age of
about 67 y (Figure 3B), and this analysis yielded a relatively
small bias ( J-shaped in Figure 1B). Similarly the proximate
cause was very large for the 1986, 0±6 analysis, because
average baseline BMI was lower for deceased than censored
subjects for all subjects at baseline (Figure 3D) and this
analysis yielded a very large bias (negative in Figure 1C).
This evidence suggests that the proximate cause and the bias
were associated in a dose±response manner.
Two strategies were tested for removing the late-life bias.
The ®rst was excluding deaths during the ®rst few years of
follow-up, the strategy used to remove the reverse-causation
bias, which is caused because fatal chronic disease decreases
BMI and simultaneously increases mortality risk.19 This
strategy was of limited effectiveness. It was unable to
remove the proximate cause in the 1982±1984, 0±10, 1986,
0±6 and 1987, 0±5 analyses (results not shown). Figure 3C,
for instance, shows that excluding deaths during the ®rst 5 y
did not remove the proximate cause in the 1986, 5±6
analysis. It was also unable to remove the bias (results not
shown). The mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve for the
1982±1984, 0±10, 1986, 0±6, and 1987, 0±5 analyses, which
were all negative before any deaths were excluded, remained
non-positive even after deaths in the ®rst 8, 5 and 3 y,
respectively, were excluded (results not shown). Excluding
deaths during the ®rst 14 y in the 1971±1975, 14±20 analysis
removed the proximate cause (Figure 3A), because it
excluded primarily deaths among the elderly Ð 70.3% in
the highest baseline age decile (mean age  72.7 y), 61.1%
in the 5th decile (45.3) and 20.0% in the lowest decile (26.8).
It also removed the bias and yielded a positive curve (Figure
1A). However, excluding deaths during less than the ®rst 14 y
did not remove the bias (results not shown).

1986 survey, interviews were only conducted for 3027 subjects who had been 55 y of age and order in the 1971 ± 1975 survey, and not all variables were assessed for

The second strategy involved using average-adulthood
BMI as mortality predictor and baseline BMI as covariate.
Conceptually baseline BMI as covariate represents the late-
life negative association between baseline BMI and mortal-
ity risk, and therefore removes it from the mortality risk vs
average-adulthood BMI relationship for all subjects. This
strategy removed the proximate cause from the 1971±1975,
0±20 and 1986, 0±6 analyses. Figure 4, which contains bar
graphs of average-adulthood BMI, adjusted for baseline
BMI, vs age level by survival status in these analyses,
showed no evidence of the proximate cause. This strategy
also yielded bias-free, positive mortality risk vs average-
adulthood BMI relationships in both analyses, as shown
in Figure 5, which presents the results of the corresponding
Cox's regression analyses. Including both average-adult-
hood BMI and baseline BMI yielded signi®cantly better
®tting models than including only average-adulthood
BMI or only baseline BMI (data not shown). This suggests
that both average-adulthood BMI and baseline BMI have
signi®cant independent effects on mortality risk, and
including both in the Cox's regression model effectively
separates their independent effects. Similar results were
found for the 1971±1975, 0±10 and 1986, 0±6 analyses for
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality (results
not shown).
In addition, because 1986 baseline BMI was used in
calculating 1986 average-adulthood BMI, analyses were con-
ducted to assess whether using these two measures together
introduced some unanticipated artifact in the 1986, 0±6
analysis. The analysis was repeated twice using: (1) 1982
average-adulthood BMI; and (2) 1971±1975 average-adult-
hood BMI as mortality predictor, because neither the 1982,
nor the l971±1975 measure contained 1986 baseline BMI.
Both of these analyses yielded mortality risk vs average-
adulthood curves which were very similar to those using
1986 average-adulthood BMI, suggesting that using the 1986
average-adulthood BMI introduced no artifacts.
Discussion
The late-life bias is different from the reverse-causation
bias,19 for several reasons. First, conceptually, the reverse-
causation bias occurs at all ages, while the late-life bias only
occurs if the proximate cause exists, ie if at baseline subjects
are mixed-age adults, a sizeable portion of whom are
elderly. Second, empirically, excluding deaths during the
®rst few years of follow-up, traditionally used to remove the
reverse-causation bias, was only able to remove the prox-
imate cause and the late-life bias in one (1971±1975, 14±20,
shown in Figures 3A and 1A) of the four analyses in which

it was tested. This ®nding accords with previously pub-
lished studies which found that excluding deaths during
the ®rst few years of follow-up is only effective in yielding a
positive mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve in a small
portion of survival analyses.1,4 One of the previously pub-
lished studies in which it was successful was the Nurses
Health Study,20 in which subjects were all under the age of
55 y. It seems likely that the subjects in this study were too
young to exhibit the proximate cause or, therefore, the late-
life bias.
The evidence for the existence of the late-life bias, as
presented in the Results section, above, is strong: (1) a
plausible causal mechanism, with a proposed proximate
cause; (2) the bias existed in all four analyses in which the
proximate cause existed; (3) the bias was removed in all
seven analyses in which the proximate cause was removed;
and (4) some evidence that there is a dose±response relation-
ship between the proximate cause and the late-life bias.
It seems likely that the strategy of using average adult-
hood BMI as mortality predictor and baseline BMI as covari-
ate is effective in simultaneously removing the late-life,
reverse-causation and regression-dilution bias, for several
reasons. First, conceptually: (1) this strategy removes the-
late-life bias because it removes the proximate cause Ð the
late-life inverse relationship between mortality risk and base-
line BMI at low baseline BMI; (2) it should remove the
reverse-causation bias, because it should remove the inverse
relationship between mortality risk and baseline BMI due
to fatal chronic disease for all subjects; and (3) it should
remove the regression-dilution bias, because average-adult-
hood BMI is a good measure of a subject's usual BMI.8,9
Second, this strategy removed the proximate cause (eg
Figure 4), and yielded apparently bias-free, positive mortality
risk vs average adulthood BMI curves in all six analyses in
Figure 4 Average-adulthood BMI, adjusted for baseline BMI, vs age, by
survival status, at two different surveys in the NHEFS. Average-adulthood
BMI was adjusted by conducting linear regression with average-adult-
hood BMI as dependent variable and baseline BMI as independent
variable, and then using the unstandardized residuals as adjusted
average-adulthood BMI. Age levels in Figure 4A are deciles, with the
®rst four deciles combined.

®dence intervals. The lowest BMI category is the reference category for

which it was tested in the present study (eg Figure 5). Third,
in the l971±1975, 0±20 analysis it yielded a more robustly
positive mortality risk vs average-adulthood BMI curve
(Figure 5A) than did excluding deaths during the ®rst 14 y
in the mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve (Figure 1A) Ð
probably because the latter analysis was unable to remove
the effects of the regression-dilution bias.8,9
The cause of the decrease in BMI among the elderly
(Figure 2) is probably mostly chronic fatal disease wast-
ing.21,22 However, other factors, not associated with poor
health, may also play a role.22 These include sarcopenia,21
bone-mineral density loss,23,24 and intentional weight
loss.25
One of the important implications of the present study
and previously published studies is that a one-point (base-
line) determination of BMI is not a reliable mortality pre-
dictor in follow-up survival analyses of the mortality risk vs
BMI relationship. A one-point determination does not allow
for: (1) assessment of the effect of average BMI throughout
adulthood on mortality risk throughout adulthood, as
was done here; (2) effective removal of the late-life bias if
subjects are mixed-age adults at baseline, as shown here and
elsewhere;1,4 (3) removal of the regression-dilution bias for
subjects at any age;8,9 and (4) a comprehensive analysis of
the causal relationships between mortality risk and BMI
among the elderly.22 It seems as if BMI determinations at
several different points during adulthood are needed for
rigorous analyses of the relationship between mortality risk
and BMI.
Several caveats seem important. The effects of dietary
intake were not assessed. Also, some of the weights used to
calculate BMI data were estimated by subjects, and that is
a potential limitation. However, there was evidence that
weight-estimation errors would not invalidate any of the
®ndings of the present study. Current estimates have been
used in most follow-up studies of the body weight-mortality
relationship,2,26±35 and have been found to be accurate. For
instance, the correlation between currently estimated and
measured weights was reported to be 0.96 in the Nurses
Health Study,20 close to the 0.98 found for the 1982±1984
current estimates in the present study. The mean 1982±1984
estimation measurement differences were found to be almost
all negative (underestimates), and within 1.6% of measured
values. Such small estimation errors could have very little
effect on the shapes of the mortality risk vs baseline BMI
curves in Figure 1.
Recalled estimated have also been found to be accurate
enough for use in follow-up studies.22 For instance, the
correlation between estimated and measured weights at age
18 in the Nurses Health study was found to be 0.87,20 close to
the correlations found here between the 1982±1984 10 y
recalled estimates and the 1971±1975 measurements of
weights at 25, 40 and 65 y of age Ð 0.91, 0.91 and 0.87
(Spearman's rho), respectively. The estimate-measurement
differences found here were also small Ð means of 1.33%,
1.09% and 1.24% of 1971±1975 measured values, for weight
at age 25, 40 and 65 y, respectively. They exhibited some
evidence of the pattern of bias found in several previously
published studies: slight overestimation by lean subjects, and
underestimation by heavy subjects.14,36±38 Such errors and
bias could cause slight steepening of the positive mortality
risk vs average-adulthood BMI curves reported here, predo-
minantly at high BMI, but could not change the positive
shape.
In conclusion, after the effects of the inverse association
between BMI and mortality risk among the elderly toward
the end of the lifespan were statistically removed, increasing
mortality risk was associated with increasing average-adult-
hood BMI, down to the lowest BMI category in the present
study (` 20 kgam2). It con®rmed by future studies, this
means that for non-elderly persons, being leaner lowers
mortality risk, down to low level of leanness. It is recom-
mended that future investigations of the mortality risk vs
BMI relationship account for the effects of the regression-
dilution, reverse-causation, and late-life biases.
