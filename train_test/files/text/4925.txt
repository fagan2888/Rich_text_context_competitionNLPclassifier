Abstract
Objective: To investigate the correlation between migraine in a Chinese population and a 4 base
pair (GAGT) insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs35975099) localized near the 3' end of the
tumour necrosis factor superfamily 10 gene, TNFSF10.
Methods: Ethnically Han Chinese patients with migraine and healthy control subjects were
recruited. TNFSF10 genotype and allele frequencies were determined via polymerase chain
reaction and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Results: Rs35975099 was in Harvey­Weinberg equilibrium in patients with migraine (n ¼ 269) and
control subjects (n ¼ 374). There were no significant relationships between allele or genotype
frequency and migraine.
Conclusion: There was no functional significance of the TNFSF10 gene polymorphism rs35975099
in migraine pathogenesis.

Introduction
Migraine is a polygenically inherited chronic
neurovascular disorder that can negatively
impact work, study, daily activities and
health-related quality-of-life. The lifetime
prevalence of migraine is between 14% and
16%, and it is three times more common in
women than in men.1,2 Migraine is clinically
classified between two subtypes based on the
presence or absence of aura, symptoms of
which include hallucinations, paraesthesia,

disturbed vision and weakness. Although
the pathological mechanism of migraine is
unclear, evidence suggests inflammation
may be involved.3,4
Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a key
cytokine involved in inflammatory reactions
and inflammation-related hyperalgesia.5
TNF may play a pivotal role in migraine
via activation of meningeal nociceptors,
reducing threshold cerebral excitability and
propagating neuronal hyperexcitability.6,7
The TNF superfamilies (TNFSF) and TNF
receptor superfamilies (TNFRSF) have
extensive actions in cell differentiation and
survival, and in controlling expression of
inflammatory cytokines.8 TNFSF/TNFRSF
gene polymorphisms have now been re-
cported in migraine. These include TNF-
308 G>A,9 TNF- 252 A>G,10 TNFSF711
and TNFRSF1B.12 TNFSF10 has been
shown to exert therapeutic efficacy for
inflammatory diseases in experimental
animal models,13 suggesting a role in the
progression of inflammation. TNFSF10
polymorphisms are also correlated with
cancer susceptibility,14,15 but there is no
direct evidence that TNFSF10 polymorph-
ism is associated with migraine.
The aim of this study was to investigate
the correlation between migraine in a Chinese
population and a 4 base pair (GAGT) inser-
tion/deletion polymorphism (rs35975099)
localized near the 3' end of TNFSF10.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study enrolled unrelated ethnically Han
Chinese patients with migraine, attending
the Neurological Outpatient Service, First
Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,
Suzhou, China, for diagnosis or follow-up
between October 2008 and December 2010.
Migraine was diagnosed and classified
according to the International Classification
of Headache Disorders-II criteria, as recom-
mended by the International Headache
Society.16 Ethnically Han Chinese control
subjects were recruited from individuals
completing a nutritional survey in the same
geographical area as the patients. Subjects
with migraine, a family history of migraine,
or any severe or recurrent headache in direct
relatives were excluded. Data regarding
tobacco use (more than one cigarette per
day for >1 year) and alcohol use (at least one
alcoholic drink per week) were recorded for
patients and control subjects.
The ethics committee of Soochow
University, Suzhou, China approved the
study, and all subjects provided written
informed consent prior to enrolment.
Genotyping
Peripheral blood (3 ml) was taken from each
subject and stored at ­20 until use. DNA
was extracted from whole blood17 and poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) for TNFSF10
was carried out as described.18 Primer
sequences were: forward 50- GGC
CCTATGTCCAAATAAGGTT-30; reverse
50- GTTCTGGGTTGAGTTGTGCTG-30.
PCR cycling conditions were 94C for
7 min followed by 35 cycles of 94C for
40 s, 60C for 40 s and 72C for 40 s, and a
final extension step at 72C for 5 min. PCR
products were separated by 7% nondenatur-
ing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
visualized by silver staining. Genotype was
determined by number and size of bands on
the gel. In order to confirm the reproduci-
bility of PCR genotyping, 10% of samples
were randomly selected and re-examined by
another technician.
Statistical analyses
Hardy­Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was
analysed by 2-test. Between-group com-
parisons of genotypic and allelic distribution
were made by 2-test. Logistic regression
analysis (adjusted for sex, age, alcohol and
tobacco use, and clinical characteristics) was
Jia et al. 327
conducted to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the
correlation between rs35975099 and
migraine risk. All statistical analyses were
two-sided and performed using SAS statis-
tical software, version 8.0 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA). P-values 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study enrolled 269 patients with migraine
(78 male/191 female; mean age 34.3Æ 11.7
years; age range 14­65 years) and 374 healthy
control subjects (106 male/268 female; mean
age 35.4Æ 10.6 years; age range 18­70 years).
There were no significant between-group
differences in age, sex distribution, tobacco
use (patient group 50/269 [18.6%] vs control
group 59/374 [15.8%]) or alcohol use (patient
group 55/269 [20.4%] vs control group 76/
374 [20.3%]). Clinical characteristics of the
patient group are shown in Table 1.
Repeat PCR confirmed that PCR geno-
typing was 100% reproducible. Genotype
frequency was in HWE, in patients and in
control subjects. Data regarding allele
and genotype frequencies are presented
in Table 2. There were no statistically
significant between-group differences in
allele or genotype distribution, with or
without adjustment for sex, age, tobacco
and alcohol use.
Results of stratification analysis for the
patient group are shown in Table 3. There
were no significant differences in allele or
genotype distribution when patients were
stratified by sex, age of disease onset, family
history of migraine or migraine type.
Discussion
Our study found no association between
genotype or allele distribution of the
TNFSF10 gene polymorphism rs35975099
and migraine in Chinese patients with
migraine.
Migraine is a primary headache disorder
with an unclear pathogenesis, although
evidence suggests that $ 40% of migraine
susceptibility is due to multiple genetic
factors.19,20 Studies support the involvement
of proinflammatory cytokines (especially
TNF) in migraine.21,22 Our earlier study
revealed a relationship between TNFRSF1B
polymorphism and an augmented risk of
migraine.12 TNFSF10 is involved in acute
and chronic inflammatory central nervous
system disorders23 and has many functions
in the peripheral and central nervous system,
including cell death and immune modula-
tion.24 There is no evidence for a correlation

This may be due to between-study differ-
ences in population demographics and the
possibility of selection bias in our study.
Secondly, our study had a relatively small
sample size, and further larger scale studies
are required.
In conclusion, we have found no major
role for the TNFSF10 gene polymorphism
rs35975099 in the pathogenesis of migraine.
