Introduction
Over the past few decades, the United States has witnessed
a marked increase in its obesity prevalence, which has dou-
bled since the 1980s. There are large disparities across pop-
ulation groups in terms of age, gender, race/ethnicity, and
socio-economic status (1). The World Health Organization
currently defines overweight and obesity with BMI (weight
(kg)/height(m)2) cut points of 25 and 30, respectively (2,3).
These were recommended by a National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute's and North American Association for the
Study of Obesity expert committee (4). The National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute's/North American Association
for the Study of Obesity committee also recommends using
waist circumference (WC) cut points of 40 inches (102cm)
in men and 35 inches (88cm) in women to define "central
obesity." Increasingly, research shows that WC or central
obesity is a better predictor of chronic diseases, mainly
type 2 
diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemias, than over-
all adiposity assessed using BMI (5,6). WC may be equally or
more useful than BMI due to its higher predictive value for
future health risks, ease of measurement, and understanding
by the general public (4­6).
The question remains unanswered as to whether shifts in
BMI and WC over the past two decades in the United States
have been occurring at equal rate across distributions of both
measures and whether they varied by gender and ethnicity. It
has been suggested that the increase in BMI has been concen-
trated in higher weight groups based on a recent study (7), a
finding with great public health implications in terms of ris-
ing health-care and quality-of-life costs (8,9). While trends in
mean BMI and obesity prevalence (1,10­17) and mean WC
and prevalence of central obesity (18­23) have been recently
studied in the United States and other countries, none have
looked at simultaneous distributional shifts (in terms of per-
centiles) across time in BMI and WC or have attempted to
use those findings to make future projections. In addition, to
date, no study has examined those shifts closely across race/
ethnicity groups. Previously, one study assessed distributional
shifts in terms of percentiles of BMI up to 1994 in the United
States (7), while another compared BMI and WC shifts using a
similar methodology in the United Kingdom (24).
This study uses the most recent US nationally representative
cross-sectional data and earlier data to assess the shifts in BMI
and WC distributions and compare the ethnic- and gender
Gender­ethnic Disparity in BMI and Waist
Circumference Distribution Shifts in US Adults

While obesity has been increasing in the United States, little is known about the variation in recent BMI and waist
circumference (WC) distribution shifts across socio-demographic groups. We assessed shifts in BMI and WC
distributions and compared between-group differences over the past decade, and projected future BMI and WC
distributions and prevalence of obesity and central obesity using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1988­1994 and 1999­2004 data. BMI/WC distributional shifts overall and in percentiles were compared
across groups. Average yearly shift was calculated and used for projecting future distributions and prevalence.
Both BMI and WC increased more in their uppermost percentile distribution, though BMI shift declined toward the
uppermost percentiles among women. Heavier Americans gained more adiposity over the past decade. Ethnic
(non-Hispanic (NH) white vs. black) disparities in mean BMI and WC became wider. Over the survey period, mean BMI
increased by 1.3 units vs. 1.8 units among men and women, whereas WC, by 4.2cm vs. 4.8cm. Young adults had the
largest increase. Shift in women's WC was stable between the 25th and 75th percentiles, but gained pace at higher
WC, while women's BMI and men's BMI and WC shifts increased linearly. NH black women had the largest shifts and
would have central obesity and obesity prevalence of 90.8 and 70.7% by 2020. Shifts in BMI and WC distribution
varied across age-, gender-, and ethnic groups. Future rise in the obesity and central obesity prevalence rates are
expected, but would vary by demographic groups.

differences in the shifts. In addition, based on these shifts and
several assumptions, we projected the future BMI and WC dis-
tribution as well as the obesity and central obesity prevalence
for each gender­ethnic group.
Methods And Procedures
Databases
The National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) database include
a series of cross-sectional surveys initiated in the 1960s that provided
nationally representative information on the nutrition and health
status of the US civilian population. We used two series of NHANES
data collected during periods of 1988­1994 (III) and 1999­2004. In this
analysis, we opted not to include earlier waves of NHANES as our goal
was to examine the shifts over the recent two decades, and these more
recent data may be better to help predict future trends. Our analyses
were 
limited to participants aged 20 years old.
NHANES III (1988­1994). NHANES III is a survey that was
carried out between 1988 and 1994 using a multistage, stratified
sampling design. The survey oversampled older adults (60 years or
more) and minority groups (nonHispanic (NH) black and Mexican
Americans (MA)). Sampled individuals were first interviewed at
home and then invited to a mobile examination center to undergo
body measurements, clinical evaluations, and laboratory testing.
Anthropometric measurements were performed on all study partic-
ipants using standardized methods and equipment. BMI was com-
puted based on measured weight and height. Weight was measured
on a Toledo self-zoning weight scale while participants wore light
clothing provided by mobile examination center. Height was mea-
sured with a stadiometer to the nearest millimeter. As for WC, it was
measured in a standard manner using a steel measuring tape to the
nearest 0.1cm. positioning it at the high point of the ilium where it
crosses the midaxillary line (25­28).
NHANES (1999­2004). Since 1999, NHANES has been a con-
tinuous annual survey. The data were recently made available for
the first 6 years of the period 1999­2004. Three bi-annual waves of
NHANES (1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004) were combined
to enhance statistical power and obtain a more accurate picture of
the current situation. Similar to NHANES III, sampling design was
stratified multistage with oversampling of older adults and minori-
ties. In addition, the low income population was also oversampled.
Home interviews were followed by a mobile examination center
examination, where follow-up questionnaires, various clinical and
body measurements were conducted and blood samples were drawn.
Using standardized methods and equipments, anthropometric
measurements including weight, height, and WC were performed
similarly to those in NHANES III (29,30).
Classification of obesity and central obesity
Obesity was defined as BMI 30kg/m2 and central obesity with WC
102cm or 40 inches for men, and 88cm or 36 inches for women (1).
Covariates
The socio-demographic variables included in our analysis were age,
gender, and race/ethnicity. The latter was categorized as NH whites, NH
blacks and MA, and "other ethnicity."
Study population
After excluding pregnant women and subjects below 20 years of age, the
final sample sizes for our analyses were 16,581 for NHANES III (popu-
lation estimates: 50.0% men; 76.6% NH whites, 10.7% NH blacks, 4.9%
MA, and 7.8% other ethnicity) and 15,332 for NHANES 1999­2004
(48.8% men; 11.0% NH black, 7.2% MA, and 9.6% other ethnicity).
Out of those, 14,544 in NHANES III had both BMI and WC data, while
12,614 in NHANES 1999­2004 had these complete data (i.e., 12­14%
of eligible sample had missing data).
Data analysis
Means with s.e. of BMI and WC as well as prevalence of obesity and
central obesity were computed after taking into account sampling design
complexity for variance estimation and using appropriate weights to
adjustforoversamplingandtoobtainnationallyrepresentativeestimates.
Differences in BMI and WC means between gender and race/ethnicity
groups were tested using ANOVA and t-tests. Trends in mean BMI and
WC were examined between NHANES III and 1999­2004 waves and
significance of change was assessed based on overlap between 95% CI.
Shift in BMI and WC distributions. Overlayed distributions of BMI
and WC for NHANES III and 1999­1904 were represented using
kernel densities, which are nonparametric smoothed graphs that are
independent of bin width when compared to histograms (31). Next,
changes in percentile values of the distribution of BMI and WC at the
two points in time (1988­1994 and 1999­2004) were analyzed graphi-
cally using a variation of the mean-difference plot (m-d) curves. While
those curves traditionally are plots of the change in the percentile
value between waves on the y-axis against the mean of the values from
the two time periods (7,24), we chose to represent this graph as follows:
On the x-axis, the actual percentile (e.g., 25th) was plotted against the
yearly average absolute shift in the BMI or WC value on the y-axis. The
average yearly shift was estimated using regression models, e.g., BMI =
yearly shift × 10.5 years; 10.5 was the difference between the midpoints
of year period). (See Equation 1).
Projections of future BMI/WC distribution and obesity/central
obesity prevalence. Point estimates of the % yearly shifts in BMI and
WC were used to conduct a simulation whereby data from NHANES
1999­2004 was used to project future changes in distributions based
on past shift patterns (using Equation 2). To this end, average absolute
yearly shifts were applied to all subjects in NHANES 1999­2004 based
on their corresponding percentiles and new values of BMI/WC were
estimated as projections for the years of 2010 and 2020. Assuming no
changes in age, sex, and race/ethnicity distributions in the US popu-
lation, means of BMI and WC and prevalence of obesity and central
obesity were then projected. BMI and WC kernel density smoothed
graphs were also created (not presented). Because of the small sample
size, we chose not report the results for the "other ethnicity" group.

All of our analyses, e.g., percentile estimates and kernel density graphs,
took into account oversampling of population groups by including appro-
priate sampling weights. Primary sampling units and strata were also
considered when computing means of BMI and WC. All analyses were
conducted using STATA version 9.0 (Stata, College Station, TX).

Both mean shifts were statistically significant. While BMI in
NHANES III was significantly higher among men compared to
women, the reverse pattern was observed in 1999­2004. Mean
WC was significantly higher among men and the gender gap
has become wider with time (6.7cm vs. 8.1cm. difference). In
both waves, mean BMI increased linearly with age particularly
between the age groups 20­29 and 50­59 for NHANES III, and
20­29 to 60­69 for NHANES 1999­2004, but dropped among
the very old (70+). A similar pattern was observed for WC.
In addition, the largest absolute increase in means of BMI
and WC was consistently among the youngest adult group
aged 20­29 (2.0kg/m2 and 6.7cm, respectively). Racial/
ethnic
disparities in mean BMI and WC have become wider over
time particularly when comparing NH blacks to NH whites
(e.g., 1.8kg/m2 vs. 1.3kg/m2 for BMI). When looking at men
and women separately, absolute shifts in BMI and WC among
menwereconsistentlythelargestamongNHwhitesand"other"
ethnic groups and among young adults (20­29 years) and those
aged 60­69. They were the smallest among those aged 50­59
and MA. Among women, shifts in BMI and WC were by far the
largest in young adults (20­29 years) and among NH blacks,
and the smallest among MA and those aged 50­59 years.
Distribution shift patterns in BMI and WC: by gender
and race/ethnicity
Figure 1 shows BMI and WC distribution curves and their shift
patterns over time by gender. Among both genders, WC distri-
bution appeared to shift at a relatively equal pace across all per-
centiles. However, unlike women, men experienced a lowering
of the peaks in the bell-shaped distribution. In contrast, shifts
in BMI were relatively faster at percentiles above the median
compared to those below it, which may explain change in shape
to a flatter distribution and the downward shift observed.
To study time shifts in BMI and WC distributions more
closely, yearly changes in mean BMI and WC in each percen-
tile group were plotted in an overlayed manner in Figure 2
through Figure 4. In the total population, while yearly shift
in BMI varied from <0.1kg/m2 at lower percentiles to around
0.4kg/m2 at upper percentiles, WC yearly shifts in percentiles
had a nonlinear pattern whereby they were stable between the
25th and 75th percentile at a value of 0.4cm (data not shown).
Gender differences in shift patterns were noted. In fact, the
stable shift pattern of WC between the 25th and 75th percentile
was only noted among women at an annual value of between
0.4 and 0.5cm (Figure 2).
Examining shift patterns by race/ethnicity and gender
(Figure 3), we found that shift acceleration in BMI at upper
percentiles was noted among all ethnic groups and for both gen-
ders, except for MA and women of "other ethnicity." However,
yearly shifts in BMI among NH black women were significantly
faster than those for WC. In addition, NH black women have
shifted in WC at an elevated rate of 0.5cm/year whenever
their percentile ranking was above the 10th. Similarly they

experienced a yearly shift in BMI of over 0.2kg/m2 for the great-
est part of their distribution (>30th percentile), compared to
NH whites who only shifted to that value >70th percentile. This
can be contrasted with shift patterns among MA men in whom
WC and BMI seem to change over time with equal amounts
across all percentiles and at a faster pace in percentiles over the
90th. Among MA women, the opposite 
pattern was observed
whereby BMI percentiles >60th 
percentile appeared to decline
in absolute value at least up till the 90th percentile. WC shifts
among MA women had an irregular pattern of acceleration.
Moreover, Figure 3 shows (in nearly all panels) that the per-
centile increases in BMI and WC are highest in the uppermost
percentiles among men. However, among women, a declining
shifts in BMI at the uppermost percentiles was noted for certain
ethnic groups including the "other ethnicity" category.
Future projections: distributions and prevalence estimates
Figure 4 shows our future projections for 2010 and 2020. In
men, by 2020 mean BMI will be the highest among NH white
men, followed closely by NH black men. However, prevalence of
obesity and central obesity would be highest among NH white
and MA men. Among women, mean BMI and WC, obesity and
central obesity prevalence will be the highest among NH black
women by 2020. The rates of increase in both obesity and central
obesity would be the slowest among MA women. One salient
pattern is that among women, only NH blacks would close the
gap in prevalence of obesity and central obesity by 2020.
Discussion
Our findings indicate that the rise in adiposity in the United
States was unequally distributed across the population and that
shifts across the spectrum of BMI and WC varied between race/
ethnicity and gender groups. There are several patterns noted
for the population-level changes in BMI and WC between the
later 1980s and 2004. First, overall, both BMI and WC distribu-
tion appeared to shift (increase) faster in the upper end of the
population distribution (i.e., those with high BMI and WC).
In other words, heavier Americans had become heavier over
time--"the fat becoming fatter," though this varied by gender
and ethnicity. Although yearly shifts in BMI and WC among
men had a similar pattern of linear increase across 
percentiles,
acceleration in WC shifts at upper percentiles was a more obvi-
ous pattern among women after leveling off between the 20th
and 90th percentile (Figure 2). BMI appeared to change
with greater amounts across all percentiles among NH black
women compared to women of NH white ethnicity, though
in both cases, the absolute yearly shift tended to decline in
uppermost percentiles (>90th percentile). The same pattern of
decline was observed among MA women and women of other
"ethnic" groups. However, NH black women's shifts in BMI
before the 90th percentile were accelerating in a linear fashion
with increased percentile ranking unlike WC which was stable
across percentiles, leading to an apparent closure of the gap
in upper percentiles between these two measures among this
gender/ethnicgroupcomparedtoNHwhitewomen(Figure3d
vs. Figure 3b).
Second, ethnic disparities in mean BMI and WC have
become wider since 1988­1994 particularly when compar-
ing NH blacks to NH whites. In addition, absolute shifts in
means of BMI and WC were consistently the largest among
NH black women and young women aged 20­29 years and the
smallest among MA and older adults aged 50­59 years. In fact,
among older subjects (50+), there was a clear discontinuity in
the mean BMI shifts whereby those aged 60­69 experience the
largest increase. This finding was also observed in a recent lon-
gitudinal study and may be related to the survival of heavier
subjects over time who had higher access to Medicare services
rather than a biological phenomenon (32).
Third, based on the trends observed in the past decade, WC
is projected to become increasingly displaced to the right with
no significant downward curve shift. In contrast, the BMI dis-
tribution is expected to become increasingly flat over time.
Assuming little change in demographic composition for the
United States in the next 15 years, we projected the future
BMI and WC distribution and the prevalence of obesity and

central obesity for each gender/ethnic group. We projected
these prevalence rates would remain the highest among NH
black women by the year 2020 (70.7 and 90.8%, respectively).
Two previous studies conducted among adults in the United
States. (earlier NHANES 1976­1980 to 1988­1994) and the
United Kingdom came to similar conclusions, a dissymmetric
shift occurring in the overall distribution. Between 1976­1980
and 1988­1994, US adults' BMI distribution has gained skew-
ness with a greater shift in its upper part, but the authors did
not examine WC (7). They argued that the patterns suggested
a combination of both profound environmental determinants
and a population with a high degree of susceptibility. A recent
UK study shows marked shifts in both BMI and WC and a
combination of overall upward increase and a rise in skewness,
which was more pronounced among younger British adults.
In particular, WC increased by >8cm in 10 years in young
women, ~0.8cm/year (24). In our US study population, for all
adults ages combined, the 90th percentile of WC increased at
0.5­0.7cm/year, which is comparable to the UK study. Young
US adults also experienced more sizeable shifts in mean WC
compared to their older counterparts.
In addition to the overall BMI and WC shift patterns, the
variation in the shifts across gender and race/ethnicity groups
may provide hints about the causes of the obesity epidemic in
the United States. Whereas genetic drifts are unlikely to occur
within a decade, environmental and behavioral changes are more
probable roots to this problem. It is possible, however, that differ-
ences in weight gain across race/ethnicity and gender groups are
behavioral and environmental responses that are also dependent
on genetic susceptibility. Gene­environment interaction model
fits well to help explain human adiposity (33­35). Our findings
suggest that subjects who are genetically susceptible and belong
to the upper percentiles of the 
distribution (BMI or WC) may be
differentially affected by (or respond to) environmental changes
that promote weight and adiposity and gain.
Our findings point to a gender­ethnicity interaction
whereby environmental changes had similar effects in some
obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2009 175

Epidemiology
cases and divergent effects in others on overall adiposity (BMI)
and body fat distribution as WC indicates visceral fat. Among
men, in general, shift patterns in BMI and WC were similar
particularly among MA. In contrast, yearly BMI shifts among
women had an upward trend with increasing percentiles, while
WC patterns of shifts were constant at least between the 25th
and 75th percentiles. NH black women had the highest yearly
increase for both WC and BMI. However, their prevalence of
obesity (BMI  30) appeared to increase at a faster pace than
central obesity, indicating that environmental changes may
affect weight gain to a larger extent than abdominal fat deposi-
tion. In all other groups, except for women of "other ethnicity,"
comparable increases were noted for prevalence of obesity and
central obesity.
The finding that the increase in overall and central adipos-
ity has been mostly noted among young adults, particularly
women, suggests that environmental changes have impacted
more strongly on this demographic group in recent years,
although this may also be due to their relatively lower initial
prevalence. Lifestyles that are more likely to be adopted by
young people include intake of high energy density foods and
snacking habits, eating away-from-home and sedentary behav-
iors (e.g., computer games, internet, TV watching habits) are
all possible mechanisms explaining age disparities.
This study has a number of strengths. First, it is based on
a representative data of adults in the United States and our
analysis corrected for design complexity and yielded national
estimates. Second, it is the first study to examine shifts in both
WC and BMI simultaneously in the United States and com-
pare those shifts across gender, age, and race/ethnicity groups.
Third, it is also the first to use past trends in distributional
shifts in both anthropometric parameters to project future
prevalence estimates for obesity and central obesity.
Our study also suffers from a few limitations. First, the trend
analyses are based on two nationally representative cross-

sectional surveys that were conducted independently 10.5 years
apart. It is possible that minor differences in sampling design
and shifts in population composition might have affected the
estimated changes in BMI and WC. A recent descriptive report
of longitudinal changes from US studies that included BMI and
other measures of adiposity indicated that annual changes in
BMI were greater within cohort studies initiated during the
1989­1996 period compared to another earlier national cohort
study conducted between 1971­1975 and 1981­1984 (the
NHANES-I follow-up study) (32). In other word, people of the
same age gained more weight/BMI with age during more recent
years than the past. On average, the later cohorts' annual BMI
gainwashigherby0.1unitinwhite,andby0.07­0.26inAfrican-
American men and women for mid ages 32­77 years than the
NHANES-I follow-up study cohort. On average, the annual
changes in BMI within each cohort examined ranged between
-0.04 units (for white men aged 79 years at baseline) and 0.43
units (for black women aged 29 years at baseline), depending
on baseline age within the cohort, gender, race/ethnicity, and
the cohorts. In general, these values seemed to be comparable
to our findings of BMI annual percentile shifts, which varied
from <0.1kg/m2 at lower percentiles to around 0.4kg/m2 at
upper percentiles. Second, our future projections of BMI and
WC distribution and related obesity prevalence are based on
the trends observed in the past and on an assumption of few
future population composition changes. This is an oversimpli-
fied scenario because our analysis did not attempt to accurately
predict the future situation and there are many uncertainties
regarding the future population distribution and environmen-
tal and policy changes in the United States. On the other hand,
our projected estimates are gender- and race/
ethnicity specific,
and thus have controlled partly for some possible population
composition changes. Third, some of the shift patterns observed
may be affected by smaller samples sizes for minority groups
(e.g., women of "other ethnicity") selected by NHANES, which
were subject to large estimate errors or uncertainties.
Our findings have some important policy implications. One
is that the national goals specified in Healthy People 2010
related to obesity cannot be met. These goals need be reas-
sessed and reframed to be more realistic and may need to target
the whole population rather than only the overweight groups.
In addition, when setting the Healthy People 2020 goals, the
differential shifts in adiposity measures across the population
distribution need be considered; and more dramatic and effec-
tive national programs and policies are needed to help achieve
the goals due to the multilevel nature of the obesity etiology
(36­38). One of our recent studies shows that if the obesity
increase trend in the United States is not controlled, it can have
many serious public health and social consequences. For exam-
ple, by 2048, the overall prevalence of overweight and obesity
among American adults would approach 100% and the total
health-care costs attributable to obesity and overweight would
double every decade to 860.7­956.9 billion US dollars by 2030,
accounting for 16­18% of total US health-care costs (39).
In conclusion, while overall, means of BMI and WC have
increased significantly over time and are expected to do so for
most socio-demographic groups in the United States, 
patterns
of shifts in distribution differed between these two 
measures
and across gender and ethnic groups. In most of these groups,
it is clear that the heavy is becoming heavier though 
central
adiposity (measured by WC) is increasing more rapidly at
the uppermost percentiles, with a nonlinear shift pattern
observed among women, and an absolute increase in WC
leveling off at a high value for most of the distribution among
NH black women. Broader and more comprehensive and

vigorousprevention,screening,andtreatmentprogramsshould
be implemented to reverse the shifts in adiposity 
measures,
we observed. Creative initiatives to impact environmental
changes are needed. In addition, ethnic and gender disparities
should be studied further to disentangle the biological from
the 
environment components explaining those differences in
distributional shifts.
