Youths and adults stand out in several respects as a particu-
larly interesting age group in an investigation of the diagnos-
ing of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
First, the diagnosis is a rather recent one. The term ADHD did
not appear in the diagnostic manuals until the end of the
1980s.1 Furthermore, the medical definition of the condition
has, traditionally, primarily been concerned with children.
The description of the clinical symptoms in the diagnostic
manuals is still colored by this tradition (The Norwegian
Health Directorate, 2007). It was not until 1994 that the crite-
ria for the diagnosis were altered, so that ADHD was defined
as a lifelong condition. As a result of this, it became possible
for adults to be diagnosed with ADHD. In 2005, adults in
Norway were given the same access as children and youths to
medical treatment with psychostimulants. The access to an
effective pharmacological treatment may have contributed to
the diagnostic assessment appearing more meaningful and
attractive, which in turn may have contributed to a rise in the
number of ADHD assessments among youths and adults.
Adults (aged 19 years or older), thus, constitute a rela-
tively new group among those who can be diagnosed with
ADHD. In line with the immediate consequences of the
above-mentioned changes, it turns out that the largest rela-
tive growth in the number of Norwegian users of ADHD
medication between 2004 and 2014 has taken place in the
age group "19 years or older."2 The remarkable thing about
those referred for a diagnostic assessment as youths or adults
is that while they have already lived for a long time with this
condition, they have lived without the ADHD diagnosis.
As suggested above, there are several plausible explana-
tions for this development. Similarly, there are theories on
the interaction between the diagnostic categories and the
people within a society that supply adequate explanations of
such a development (Hacking, 2004; Latour, 1987).3 Newer
empirical research has also shed more light on different
aspects of the diagnostic assessment of adults. This research
includes descriptions of typical challenges for adults with
ADHD, and underlines the importance of the diagnostic
assessment and treatment for the adults'self-image, and their
ability to handle these challenges (Fleischmann & Miller,
2013). It has been documented that the same symptoms and
challenges are registered in the various life phases both in
North America and Europe (Brod, Pohlman, Lasser, &
Hodgins, 2012). It has also been proven that students may
struggle to handle their "medicated selves" (Loe & Cuttino,
2008), that adults may learn how to take advantage of their
ADHD idiosyncrasies in a positive manner (Fleischmann &
Fleischmann, 2012), and that it seems difficult to develop an
effective test or method to uncover instances of misdiagnosis
(Musso, Hill, Barker, Pella, & Gouvier, 2014). It is, however,
harder to come by empirical investigations that help describe
specific events and courses of events in the individual

Youths' and Adults' Stories Related to the
Background for ADHD Assessment
Bjørg Mari Hannås1
Abstract
In connection with a study relating to the diagnosing of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), youths and adults
represent a particularly interesting group, partly because they have lived a relatively long time with the condition but without
the diagnosis. In this article, I am focusing particularly on the life stories of youths and adults before they were referred
for an ADHD assessment. A narrative analysis of a body of empirical data material shows that the subjects' stories about
the background for their referral are dominated by three themes: substantial health-related disorders and problems, diffuse
sensations that "something" was wrong, and experiences relating to their identification with the diagnosis. The study shows
that most of the respondents had been in contact with their regular general practitioner (GP)--and in many cases had tried
out various diagnoses and treatments--long before the question of ADHD was raised.

processes of youths and adults, preceding and leading up to
the diagnostic ADHD assessments. Among the questions that
are especially salient for further attention are
·
· When and how have any symptoms of the condition
manifested in earlier stages of life?
·
· In what way were the relevant symptoms and chal-
lenges perceived and handled?
·
· How did the suspicion of ADHD become relevant,
and what happened after?
In my doctoral dissertation in sociology, I have previously
examined various aspects of youths' and adults' everyday life
and self-understanding before and after the diagnostic assess-
ment of ADHD (Hannås, 2010). This dissertation is based on
a comprehensive qualitative study. In this article, I would like
to--based on empirical material from the same study--focus
especially on particular experiences from the histories of
youths and adults before they were referred forADHD assess-
ment. The main research question is as follows:
Research Question 1: What is the background for youths
and adults being assessed for ADHD?
Methodological and Analytical
Approach
The referred study is based on semi-structured interviews.
This is a form of interviews characterized by open-ended
questions, where the informants are given the opportunity to
raise their own topics during the conversations. Both this
interview form--explicitly and implicitly encouraging the
sharing of personal experiences--and the subsequent analy-
sis of the narratives in the autobiographical stories are
strongly influenced by a narrative approach to the research
question (Briggs, 1986; Riessman, 1993).
In collaboration with the adult psychiatric and children and
youth psychiatric clinics, the public educational psychology
service and the Norwegian interest organization for ADHD,
19 respondents aged 14 to 57 years were recruited to the inter-
view study. Two criteria were defined for participating in the
study. First, the participants had to have been referred for a
diagnostic ADHD assessment as youths or adults. Second,
they should be aged 19 years or older. In three cases, I chose to
include participants below the age of 19; specifically, two
14-year-olds and one 17-year-old. This was done at the request
from the psychologists that helped recruit participants, as they
felt that these youths would be well suited for participation in
the study. The respondent group is comprised of 10 partici-
pants who had already completed their diagnostic assessment
some time (on average about 2.5 years) before I interviewed
them. These participants were interviewed once each. The
remaining 9 participants were referred for ADHD assessment
at the beginning of the interview study. These participants
were interviewed both before and after their diagnostic assess-
ments.4 In the analysis, the data material is handled as a whole,
with no distinction between the two sub-groups of partici-
pants. The interview study spanned over a period of about 1½
years. At the time of completion, 15 of the 19 participants had
been diagnosed with ADHD (see Table 1). One participant
(Ida, 42) had her suspicion of ADHD disproved by her diag-
nostic assessment. Another (Carl, 23) elected to abort the
assessment because it was too problematic to carry it out dur-
ing working hours. A third (Hanna, 40) was still waiting for
the final conclusion of her assessment. Finally, a fourth
(Therese, 19) had asked for an assessment to get rid of an
ADHD diagnosis she had had for several years; an effort that
proved successful. The analysis in the study is conducted on
the data material in its entirety, that is, all of the interviews
with everyone of the 19 informants.
All of the interviews were audio-taped. The recordings
have been transcribed into texts where other forms of mean-
ingful expression, for example, gestures, pauses, intonation,
and so on, are indicated as well. The empirical material con-
sists of 33 interviews, each lasting between 1½ and 2½ hr. In
addition, an interview log-book has been kept, and notes

taken from individual telephone conversations, text mes-
sages, and emails from the participants. These notes have
supported the processing of the data material, which was
conducted by the author. All of the participants have been
supplied the results of this processing, and were invited to
respond to the presentation of the data before publishing.
Several participants replied that they felt represented cor-
rectly. None replied with critical comments or objections to
the presentations.
The narrative approach upon which the study was founded
was clearly reflected in the transcribed texts. The transcrip-
tions showed that each interview more or less consisted of an
array of autobiographical narratives of shorter or longer
duration. The narratives represented various personal experi-
ences that referred to specific events--or sequences of
events--at different times or phases in the lives of the indi-
viduals. Most of the narratives were easy to identify, in the
sense that they, for example, had a clear beginning and a
marked ending. This was, among other things, manifested
through different forms of "entrance and exit talk" (Riessman,
1993, p. 58). All the narratives were characterized by the
common overall theme of the conversations: "life with
ADHD--before and after the diagnostic assessment," a
theme that the participants had been made familiar with prior
to the interviews. This contributed to connecting different
narratives within each interview to a personal life story.
To gain an overview of the contents of the transcribed
material, the different narratives in the 19 life stories were
first identified and classified using different codes. These
codes were not pre-defined, but rather created as needed in
the course of the classification process. After coding the
whole raw material, I was left with 26 different codes. These
codes had been labeled according to the actual content or plot
in the narratives, for example, "movies/TV," "brain damage,"
"medication," "clutter," "different," "conversations," "dis-
tress," "school," "work," "friends," "family," and so on.
In actual life, different events and actions follow each
other in chronological order. Over time, a string of such hap-
penings may create--or seem to create--a certain course of
events. The connections between the various happenings
encompassed in such a course of events are, in reality, not
necessarily of a deterministic or causal character. Still, it
turns out that "earlier happenings are, however, often retro-
spectively seen as a precondition for later happenings"
(Horsdal, 1999, p. 123, author's translation). In the autobio-
graphical narratives, the "story," however, does not follow
the actual or chronological order of the specific happenings
or "events." In autobiographical narratives, especially those
dealing with the important experiences in life, the author
tends to continually move back and forth in time. The author
digresses, and supplies personal commentary and evalua-
tions in the course of the narrative (Riessman, 1993). To gain
an overview of the chronological order of events, the coded
narratives were systematized based on the actual time of the
various events in the life stories.
The form of narrative causality described above contrib-
uted to some specific narratives from the time preceding the
referral appearing, in retrospect, to constitute plausible
explanations for the referrals for diagnostic assessment. In
the same way, the narratives concerning the assessment and
the result of this, appeared to be a natural explanation or con-
sequence of the narratives concerning different sorts of dif-
ficulties and challenges.
After identifying which narratives functioned as reasons
or explanations for the narratives regarding the referral, the
empirical material was reduced by keeping these narratives,
whereas the other narratives, in this context, could be elimi-
nated from further analysis.
The remaining narratives were then systematized into dif-
ferent main categories and sub-groups, based on an analysis
of the themes of the narratives. During this part of the analyti-
cal effort, one narrative could occasionally be placed several
places at once. The final result of the analytical process
uncovered three main themes emerging from the participants'
narratives of the background for their ADHD assessment.
Autobiographical narratives may, for several reasons,
often deviate from the actual events they refer to. One partial
explanation for this may be that the narratives are situated
interpretations of earlier experiences, and that insights
gleaned from later events may contribute to a retrospectively
founded interpretation of earlier events. The narrative of one
specific experience may, in this way, change from one situa-
tion to another (Horsdal, 1999). The autobiographical narra-
tives, in other words, do not reveal the past the way it really
was. On the contrary, they reflect the meaning which the
authors at any given point in time--consciously or uncon-
sciously--attribute to earlier events in their own lives. Even
if they do not represent any sort of objective truth, the auto-
biographical narratives are still required to have some sort of
credibility. One of the main requirements of the autobio-
graphical narratives is a level of consistency that makes them
appear--and be accepted by others--as trustworthy: "The
historical truth of an individual's account is not the primary
issue. . . . `Trustworthiness' not `truth' is a key semantic dif-
ference: The latter assumes an objective reality, whereas the
former moves the process into the social world" (Riessman,
1993, pp. 64-65).5
As pointed out before, there are weaknesses, too, associ-
ated with a narrative form of analysis. In this context, the
advantage is the ability to take the narrative's creation of
meaning more into account in the analytical work than a more
traditional coding and categorizing of the textual material
would allow.6 One of the main functions of a narrative is that,
through both its form and its contents, it contributes to config-
uring or creating meaning in life (Horsdal, 1999). A more tra-
ditional approach to the textual material, " . . . by taking bits
and pieces, snippets of a response out of context" (Riessman,
1993, p. 3) would reduce the ability to take into account the
participants' interpretations of meaning: "Precisely because
they are essential meaning-making structures, narratives must
4 SAGE Open
be preserved, not fractured, by investigators, who must
respect respondents' ways of constructing meaning and ana-
lyze how it is accomplished" (Riessman, 1993, p. 4).
There is no single specific method or approach to narra-
tive analysis. On the contrary, there is a range of different
approaches to texts of a narrative character. Furthermore,
narrative methods combine well with other forms of qualita-
tive analyses (Riessman, 1993). As can be gleaned from the
above description, I have combined elements from a tradi-
tional form of cross-sectional analysis (from Grounded
Theory, cf. Glaser & Strauss, 1967), with elements of Labov's
method for analysis of personal narratives, in the course of
processing the empirical data.7
Three Main Themes of the
Autobiographical Narratives
The analysis showed that three main themes dominate the
background narratives of the youths and adults. The first
theme refers to various types of health-related disorders
and problems. This is a main theme in 14 out of the 19 life
stories. The second theme is a sort of diffuse sensation of
not being quite like everyone else, and that "something"
must be wrong. This is a main theme in 10 out of the 19 life
stories. Last, the third main theme is identification. This
theme covers the way the participants themselves, at a cer-
tain point, started identifying with the ADHD diagnosis.
Identification is a main theme in every one of the 19 life
stories. In 8 of the 19 life stories, both health-related disor-
ders and problems and diffuse sensations show up as paral-
lel main themes. In 2 of the life stories, identification is the
sole main theme. In these cases, the participants empha-
sized that they had not experienced any specific difficulties
or challenges prior to their referral for a formal ADHD
assessment.
A more detailed presentation of the three main themes is
given below. The in-text quotes are supplied as representa-
tive examples of how different aspects of the three main
themes were expressed throughout the empirical material.
Health-Related Disorders and Problems
Health-related disorders and problems turned out to be a pro-
nounced theme in 14 out of the 19 life stories. Common for
these 14 life histories are the descriptions of longer periods
of time characterized by various sorts of illness and health-
related issues and problems. The analysis shows that, in most
cases, the respondents' problems started a long time before
an assessment for ADHD became a relevant question. The
narratives include descriptions of numerous health-related
issues, and the diverse consequences of these. In one respect,
the narratives refer to the participants'personal experience of
their own ailments, spanning a broad specter; from different
somatic complaints like fever or pains, to problematic mood
swings and feelings of total exhaustion. A recurring experi-
ence in these narratives is spoken of as "hitting the wall" or
"having a breakdown."
Kari (28): So I had a--. I hit the wall, as they put it. . . . It was
just that I couldn't, uh--both be a mother, and a housewife, and
be a wife at the same time! . . . That was how I felt. At my lowest
point. And then they [medical professionals] started with the
manic depressive and all that sort of stuff. (Hannås, 2010,
p. 100)
In another respect, the narratives refer to how other peo-
ple, especially physicians and medical professionals, per-
ceived, interpreted, and defined these challenges in different
circumstances:
Linda (46): I don't know if there's anything they haven't
assessed me for, let me put it like that. . . . But there's been--yes,
brain tumor and arthritis several times--and MS--and he [the
regular GP] started talking about this ME and fibromyalgia.
(Hannås, 2010, pp. 103-104)
Upon meeting with the health care services, the partici-
pants' issues have been interpreted as symptoms of several
different disorders, but among the most frequently men-
tioned are depression, bipolar disorder, burnout syndrome,
and chronic fatigue syndrome. Several of the participants
have received other diagnoses, and tried different treatments,
such as lithium, antidepressants, or tranquilizers, before
being referred for ADHD assessment.
June (30): Because, you know, I've had "type two bipolar," and
I've had "borderline," and I've had "personality disorder," and
then I've had--. Yeah, because every time I've been in contact
with the psychiatrists, I've ended up with a new diagnosis.
(Hannås, 2010, p. 109)
The participants often seem to have been skeptical
toward--or disagreed with--the doctors' assessments.
Several informants neglected to try out medication that they
were prescribed based on diagnoses that they were basically
skeptical of:
Rigmor (41): I went to my regular GP. . . . he gave me happy
pills. . . . I did not feel depressed. And I did not have any fear of
going out for coffee or any of those things. . . . I did not take that
medication. (Hannås, 2010, p. 121)
Others, like June (30), said that they had tried the pre-
scribed medication, but rejected it as it did not do them any
good: " . . . I said from the beginning that I wanted out of the
lithium, because it didn't help my depressions" (Hannås,
2010, p. 109).
The first and foremost characteristics of the many stories
of illness, however, are the comprehensive and dramatic con-
sequences these health-related issues had for the individuals.
Hannås 5
Periodically, they made the participants quite incapable of
functioning adequately in everyday activities, both at home
and at work. They were drained of energy, and consequently
many had to take sick leaves. Several participants told they
had been more or less bed-ridden--in some cases up to a full
year.
An overview showing how many of the participants who
ended up on sick leave or disability pension illustrates both
the degree and the magnitude of their challenges tied to
health-related issues. Table 1 gives an overview of the
respondents' participation in education and work at the time
when the interview study finished. The bracketed numbers
following the names indicate the age of the informants at the
beginning of the study. The columns marked "Diag." indi-
cate who had or had not been diagnosed with ADHD by the
end of the study.
Table 1 shows that 12 out of the 19 participants were either
on sick leave or disability pension, and that 9 of them were
completely out of education or work life. Furthermore, it
shows that 7 out of the 19 informants were neither on sick
leave nor disability pension. However, it should be pointed out
that most of the participants who were neither on sick leave
nor on disability pension (4 out of 7) were under education.As
some of these participants also spoke of health-related prob-
lems, this might indicate that the educational system is more
tolerant or flexible with regard to individual adaptation needs,
compared with work life. It should also be noted that the table
shows that just 3 out of the 19 participants were working full-
time, and that 2 out of these 3 were among those who were not
diagnosed with ADHD by the end of the study.8
Diffuse Sensations
The majority, that is, 10 of the 19 life stories, contained nar-
ratives of various childhood experiences, circling the topic of
being set apart and feeling different from other people. No
analytical categories had been pre-defined before the study,
and neither was this a theme that the participants were
encouraged to illuminate in the course of the interviews,
unless they broached the subject themselves. Still, diffuse
sensations emerge as the second main theme of the narratives
of the background for ADHD referral.
The recurring theme of these narratives is the diffuse, but
nevertheless constant feelings in the participants that some-
thing had to be wrong with them. Many of these narratives
start out with memories from early childhood. They may be
tied to very different practical situations. The common denom-
inator is the experience of being different, and coming up
short--most often as a consequence of some sort of deviation
or breach between their own or others' expectation (general
norms) and their own social performance. In some narratives,
this description is specified as difficulty controlling their own
behavior in a socially acceptable way in certain situations or
contexts. Typical of other narratives is that the respondents
themselves do not really understand what it is they are doing
"wrong." For example, Hanna (40) told me that she noticed a
long time ago that others--interacting with her--tended to
react with raised eyebrows or shrugs, and subsequently with-
drawing from her; however, she had no idea why they did this.
Hanna was one of several respondents who told me she had
struggled to gain and keep friendships in the way her peers
did, both in her childhood and her youth. When Hanna started
telling me about the background for finally being referred for
ADHD assessment, she began her story thus:
Hanna (40): I was seriously starting to wonder if I was retarded,
you know! . . . And the way people reacted to me, I was
wondering: Is my head muddled? . . . Am I stupid!? (Hannås,
2010, p. 116)
In other instances, however, the participants had managed
to put together some of what it was that others were reacting
to. Not uncommonly, this tends to be about the participants,
in various contexts, behaving too actively, engaged or ener-
getically compared with general norms of social interaction.
This was expressed in different ways, but often, as exempli-
fied by Sina's (34) story below, there was some sort of
observable physical activity. In this excerpt, Sina casts light
on a childhood memory, introduced by a little story about her
own daughter:
Sina (34): My youngest daughter is very active. . . . And it hurts
me so damn much when people comment: "Can't you get her to
shut up? Can't you make her sit still? Man, that girl of yours is
active!" . . . Because I remember those comments from when I
was little. Like when mom and they were in the kitchen smoking
when they had guests: "Are you kidding me, you haven't had
that girl of yours checked yet!" And then I wondered if I was
actually a mongoloid--and they hadn't told me. Because I was
definitely different! (Hannås, 2010, p. 116)
The narratives in this category are often about the partici-
pants finally wondering whether their brain is not working
the way it should. This interpretation can be said to be
strangely consistent with the medical assumption thatADHD
is caused by a neurobiological failure in brain function. The
medical explanation for ADHD thus turned out to represent a
reasonable rationale in the self-understanding for some of the
participants. Mariann (33), for example, began our conversa-
tion with some reflections on the following memory:
Mariann (33): When I was about 12-13 years old, I was going
around thinking I had a brain injury, but that no one dared tell
me. I probably felt that something was not quite right, but I
didn't understand what was wrong. (Hannås, 2010, p. 112)
After a long conversation, she finished her story by telling
me about her own reaction when she was diagnosed:
Mariann (33): It was a relief to get it. . . . 'Cause I got . . . uh, like
. . . this feeling that I had a brain injury--that they wouldn't tell
me about--I had it! . . . In a way. . . . The fact that I was going
6 SAGE Open
around feeling different and . . . that things were . . . were odd.
Like, . . . I felt a little bit good about finally knowing that there
actually was a reason. It wasn't because I uh--[pretended]. Like:
I was different! And it was a good feeling [to get this confirmed].
(Hannås, 2010, p. 114)
Along with the narratives above referring to descriptions
of concrete suspicions of disorders and brain impairment,
there are other examples of less specific descriptions and
more direct statements, such as this,
Nora (33): . . . since I was really young, I've felt that [drawing
a deep breath]: I'm not like them! I'm not like the others! I'm
not! (Hannås, 2010, p. 118)
Identification
The background narratives about identification deal with
how the participants at some point themselves identified
their challenges with the ADHD diagnosis. This event turned
out to have taken place at very different times in the various
life stories. All of the 19 life stories contain narratives with
this main theme. An eye-catching feature about these is that,
generally, the participants themselves were the ones who
asked to be referred for assessment. Only in 3 of the cases it
was a worker in the specialist health service who first sug-
gested ADHD assessment. For most participants, then, the
process of identification with the diagnosis in other words
started well before--and completely independently of--the
diagnostic assessment of the individuals.
From the narratives about health-related disorders and
problems, it was evident that most participants contacted
their regular general practitioners (GPs) because of various
types of somatic or psychological symptoms or complaints.
The fact is that several participants were actually diagnosed
with and treated for various other disorders before ADHD
was ever suspected. In many cases, the follow-up of their
own children, already in the process of being diagnosed with
or treated for ADHD, seems to have had a crucial role in a
process where the parents eventually related their own prob-
lems to their children's diagnosis. For example, Hanna (40),
who had a son diagnosed with ADHD 2 years prior to our
first encounter, supplied the following background for her
asking for ADHD assessment for herself:
Hanna (40): When [he got his diagnosis] we enlisted him in the
ADHD association, and received a lot of brochures and such.
Among those was one about girls and women. I put that aside,
because I thought that this has nothing to do with him! Heh! . . .
And then I stumbled upon that brochure again later while cleaning.
And I thought I would just have a look in it, before throwing it out.
And then I had one of those--. "Wow, what is this," I thought.
"This is just so like me it's scary!" (Hannås, 2010, p. 117)
Instead of throwing the brochure out, Hanna put it aside.
The next time she happened to come across it, she plucked
up her courage, and asked to be assessed for ADHD. All in
all, 12 (eventually, 13) of the 19 participants in the study had
children of their own. Some of the children were still babies;
however, out of these 12, there were 7 participants who had
at least one child with an ADHD diagnosis before they them-
selves were referred for assessment. In most cases, the par-
ents identified with some descriptions of ADHD in women
or adults, supplied by the specialist health care services.
These descriptions were conveyed either by educational
material or through courses following the assessment and
treatment of their children. Linda (46) was one of these infor-
mants. She had several children with the ADHD diagnosis.
She also had many years of various kinds of sick leave,
assessments, and treatments behind her, before asking to be
assessed for the same diagnosis as her children had. Linda
aptly characterized the process these 7 participants had gone
through: "I guess the way it works is . . . that I have inherited
this diagnosis from my children, then?"
Even though several of the participants, for different rea-
sons, had been familiar with the descriptions of clinical
symptoms in diagnostic manuals for a long time, it was still
not until they were acquainted with a kind of alternative
description of the diagnosis that their suspicion of having
ADHD themselves was raised.9 Along with the official infor-
mation that was disseminated through courses and brochures,
alternative descriptions based on other people's personal
experiences with ADHD had spread through the participants'
social networks of family members, friends, and acquain-
tances. The participants' requests for assessment often seem
to have been motivated by a sense of affiliation with "signifi-
cant others." The many examples of Linda's (46) narrative of
"inheriting the diagnosis from her children" indicate that
their own children often seem to perform as the "significant
other." There are also examples of siblings and other family
members playing an important role in the identification pro-
cess of the adult informants. In one case, the participant's
own study work, and in another case, the mother's study
work seems to be the trigger for the participants identifying
with the diagnosis.
For the young people, it seems that friends are often the
most important "significant others." In the absence of prob-
lematic experiences, close relations with other young people
with ADHD diagnoses appear to be a key factor in the pro-
cess leading to formal assessment. An example of this is the
following excerpt from Carl's (23) narrative:
Carl (23): A friend of mine--uh [who is] a bit older than me--
went and got diagnosed with ADHD. And he, like me, reads a
lot. He had read quite a lot about ADHD--and saw himself
and also a lot of me in it, you know, as he read, . . . (I) sat down
and started reading a bit--and I saw that it fitted. (Hannås,
2010, p. 122)
In the continuing process--that is, in the effort of obtain-
ing a referral for an assessment by the specialist health care
Hannås 7
services--the network of friends and family members with
the diagnosis appears to be an important and useful tool. For
example, Carl (23) told that he had simply "stopped by a
therapist in a psychiatric youth team":
Carl (23): I contacted him [the therapist] first. My friend, who
was already getting treated there, had mentioned me to him.
Because my friend and I are very much alike, in many ways.
And he [the therapist] told me to just stop by, and we could have
a chat. And after talking to him for a bit, he took me in for a
proper assessment. (Hannås, 2010, p. 123)
As it turned out, many of those who had contacted their
regular GPs because of their problems earlier, faced a kind of
resistance when they asked to be assessed for ADHD. Not
uncommonly, this resistance resulted in the participants hav-
ing to go through a period of negotiation with their regular
GPs before finally getting the referral they sought.10 In cases
where these negotiations appeared especially difficult, or
even completely deadlocked, the participants solved their
problem by bypassing their GPs. Like the participants who
wanted an assessment without any previous health-related
issues, they utilized the networks of their respective friends
or family members to contact the specialist health care ser-
vices directly. Rigmor (41), in this vein, told that she--after
seeing one of her own children, one brother and several other
family members diagnosed with ADHD--contacted her reg-
ular GP to get referred for ADHD assessment. About the fol-
lowing events, she told this,
Rigmor (41): I went to my GP. And then I asked for a referral for
an assessment. And he started laughing at me. And he told me
that "No, you don't have [ADHD]" . . . He thought I was manic
depressive, so he gave me happy pills. (Hannås, 2010, p. 121)
The GP explained to Rigmor, who was already on disabil-
ity pension, that he regarded her chronic pain as a symptom
of her depression. This, however, was a judgment Rigmor
could not agree upon. As the GP had, practically speaking,
denied her request to be referred, she tried an alternative
approach to assessing whether or not she had ADHD:
Rigmor (41): So then, I rang the children and youth psychiatric
service, and talked to the people I'm dealing with there because
of my child. Because we have discussion groups, and we have--.
I got an appointment there. . . . And then she did one of those--.
And she said, "I can do a--, a straightforward, easy screening to
see whether you have--, if you're depressive." Anyway, it
was--, I think it was four or five sheets on one of those forms.
Then she said, "You're--, you're nowhere near being
depressive!" And NN [name of therapist at the clinic] did the
same test then, before he started the ADHD assessment, to make
sure I wasn't depressive. (Hannås, 2010, p. 121)
In several narratives, the regular GP seems to have been
reluctant to comply with the participants' request for a refer-
ral, because, he had a different opinion of what the
underlying cause of the problem might be. By directing the
request directly to the specialist health care services, this
kind of remonstrance seemed to be avoidable or possible to
overcome.11
The participants' narratives about identification also con-
tain examples of reflection on why ADHD was not suspected
at an earlier stage in their lives. The relevant explanations are
closely tied to the question of how well their difficulties con-
formed to the various notions of the ADHD diagnosis at any
given time. Many participants have experienced symptoms
that could fit several diagnoses, and there seems to be a vari-
ation in terms of which diagnoses and which symptoms that
have been most prominent at different times. In many cases,
the participants'problems have been perceived and described
as something other than ADHD. The data material contains
examples of the participants' problems being treated as eat-
ing disorders, self-harm, depressions, bipolar disorder, aller-
gies, learning disabilities, different types of social difficulties,
and so on. Several of the participants grew up in a period
when the diagnoses ADHD (or minimal brain dysfunction
[MBD]) were frequently associated with aggressive, violent,
or criminal (generally) boys, who were often referred to as
"delinquents" or "hooligans." Except from the youngest
ones, a striking number of the participants pointed out that
only children very different from themselves had been diag-
nosed with ADHD (or MBD) when they grew up. An exam-
ple of this is Mariann's (33) narrative:
Mariann (33): Um--we have, in our family, an extreme case of
MBD. He got the diagnosis when he was 8, and he's now 27. So
he uh--he took all the attention for anything resembling MBD
and ADHD. He was all over the place, and gets full score on
every symptom--and heh! And so, all the focus--in the entire
family--was on him. . . . "Uh--and my dad was in the MBD
association. I think he was a member of the board. And my
primary school teacher was also--, is on the advisory board for
the ADHD association now. And no one had ever any idea that I
could have anything like that!" (Hannås, 2010, p. 112)
Others, especially among the older participants, meant
that they had always been considered as perfectly ordinary
children. Some suggested that they from time to time--at the
most--might have been seen as "troublesome" or "impossi-
ble" children. Instead of justifying their request for assess-
ment by telling stories of diffuse sensations of being different,
some of these participants, conversely, emphasized and
explained which factors they believed might have contrib-
uted to them never experiencing any specific difficulties ear-
lier in life. Peter (53) told about a good life, first as a
child--both at home and at school--and then through years
of working as an adult, before any difficulties emerged. He
pointed out that he, for example, had never been aggressive
while growing up. He also emphasized that he was both an
only child, and belonged to a generation growing up with
housewife-mothers, in a period of "proper conditions" and
stricter demands on discipline at school. Carl (23), who
8 SAGE Open
represents the next generation, believed that his teachers may
have considered him a fidgety or distracted pupil. At the
same time, he pointed out that this was a common phenom-
enon in the school, and not something that would raise any
suspicion of ADHD. Carl (23), also, added that his mother
had facilitated things so well for him that his problems never
became apparent at home. He guessed that this also contrib-
uted to "it not being discovered before he became that old."
Key Events and Courses in the Stories
In the model shown in Figure 1, different events and courses
in the various life stories are illustrated. The model is based
on identifying seven different key events that were recurrent
in the participants' stories. A key event, in this respect, is an
event that turns out to be especially significant for the under-
standing of the events, and the way they are connected; that
is, the course of events in the respective background narra-
tives.12 In the model, the relevant key events are labeled "dif-
fuse sensations," "health-related disorders and problems,"
"regular GP," "various diagnoses/treatments," "identifica-
tion," "negotiation referral," and "referral to specialist." The
arrows between the boxes in the model illustrate typical
courses of events in the different types of stories about the
background for the youths and adults being referred for
ADHD assessment. The stories have different courses of
events. The numbers 1, 2, and 3 (by each oval) refers to the
starting point for the different stories, whereas the arrows
between the ovals indicate what direction the course of
events in the various narratives took.
In the first variety, the stories start out with narratives of
different sensations of something being wrong. The next key
event in these histories, "identification," represents the sto-
ries of how the participants ended up identifying with the
ADHD condition. From this point, there are two separate
courses. One, proceeding by the key event "negotiating
referral," represents the stories where the participants con-
tacted the primary health care services. In most cases, this
led to their having to negotiate with their regular GP before
their referral to a specialist finally came through. The other
course illustrates the development of the stories where the
participants bypassed negotiations with the primary health
care services, and--sometimes through middle men--
directed their request for ADHD assessment directly to (a
representative of) the specialist health care services.
The second variety of the typical courses of events starts
out at Step 2 of the model, with "health-related disorders and
problems." The stories continue with narratives of the par-
ticipants turning to their GPs for help with their issues, start-
ing off a period of time characterized by assessment and
trying out different diagnoses and treatments. From there, the
stories continue with narratives linked to the subsequent key
event, "identification." These often proved to be connected
to other close acquaintances or family members of the par-
ticipants receiving an ADHD diagnosis. Onward, the stories
take one of the same two paths as the stories starting out with
"diffuse sensations."
In the third variety, the stories start out with narratives of
the key event "identification," at Step 3 of the model. From
here, these stories also take one of the same alternate courses
as the other two varieties; continuing on either through nego-
tiations for referral in the primary health care services, or
directly (alternatively through a middle man with some sort
of personal connection) into the specialist health care ser-
vices. These stories stand out from the two former varieties
in the sense that they represent a type of stories that does not
refer to previous experiences, neither of distressing health-
related problems nor of diffuse sensations. The lack of
health-related issues may partially explain these participants
inclination to bypass primary health care services, and
instead direct their request for assessment directly to the spe-
cialist health care services. It should be emphasized, how-
ever, that there were only 2 out of 19 instances of this kind of
story in the empirical data material altogether.
The purpose of the above-mentioned model is to sketch a
sort of analytical representation of three different courses of
histories that stood out in the data material. The dashed arrow
in the model's top left corner illustrates that the different nar-
ratives may also be part of one and the same life story. A life
story might start out with a narrative of a diffuse sensation,
continue with a narrative of health-related disorders and
problems, before moving on to a narrative about a sort of
personal identification with ADHD. The objective, in this
context, is not primarily to quantify the different key narra-
tives, but rather to display the different courses of events that
emerged, based on the analysis of the participants' life sto-
ries. Table 2, however, provides insight as to how the three
different main themes are distributed over four different vari-
eties of histories in the data material.
The column on the far left distinguishes four different
courses of events in the life stories. In the three following
columns, "X" indicates which main theme is represented in
the different types of life histories. The row labeled "Type 1"

shows that diffuse sensations was the main theme in 2 life
stories where health-related disorders and problems did not
come up as a main theme. The row labeled "Type 2" shows
that health-related disorders and problems was the main
theme of 7 life stories where diffuse sensations were not a
main theme. "Type 3" shows 2 life stories with identification
as a main theme, without any of the other main themes being
represented. Identification, as previously mentioned, was a
main theme in all of the 19 life stories. The row labeled
"Type 4" shows that, in 8 of the life stories, both diffuse sen-
sations and health-related disorders and problems were main
themes. The numbers in the bottom row of the table shows
that diffuse sensations was a main theme in 10 of the 19 life
stories. It is also apparent that health-related disorders and
problems was a main theme in 15 of the 19 life stories, in
total (including one describing problems with violence).
The Search for an Explanation
Seventeen of the 19 life stories contain narratives in which
the actions of the participants can be interpreted as an expres-
sion of their search for an underlying explanation or reason
for their challenges.
In the narratives of health-related disorders and prob-
lems, this is often expressed by a steadily seeking for medical
help and advice. The problems are perceived as symptoms of
various diagnoses, and the participants are receiving various
treatments, before ending up with ADHD as the final expla-
nation of their disorders. The narratives refer to problems
that are usually widely accepted symptoms of some sort of
illnesses or health-related disorders. The problems appear
unquestionable; the challenge is finding their root cause.
In the narratives of diffuse sensations such references to
obvious, visible signs and widely accepted symptoms of ill-
ness or health-related disorders are lacking. Instead, this
vague feeling of not being like everyone else is reported. As
a consequence of repeated experiences of failure and social
rejection, the participants however feel that something must
be wrong. For lack of better options, some start wondering if
they are suffering from some sort of brain impairment. The
lack of obvious manifestations as well as reasonable expla-
nations is a common characteristic of these narratives.
Hence, the participants' search for an explanation is primar-
ily motivated by a need for confirmation that their problems
are real--and that there is an underlying reason for their
problems.
By the end of the interview survey, 17 out of the 19 par-
ticipants had finished their ADHD assessments, and received
their conclusions. Fifteen of these 17 had the diagnosis con-
firmed, while 2 had their ADHD suspicions disproved. All of
the 15 that were given the diagnosis described this as a major
relief. This is in accordance both with results from other
studies on ADHD in adults (Fleischmann & Miller, 2013),
and with theories in the field of medical sociology (Frank,
1995). Interestingly, however, the same applied to the 2 par-
ticipants that did not receive the diagnosis. One of these had
asked for an assessment to get rid of the diagnosis (Therese,
19). The other one (Ida, 42), however, had strong hopes of
confirming her ADHD suspicions.13 Ida (42) had two chil-
dren, both of whom had already received the ADHD diagno-
sis, and she herself had struggled with comprehensive
health-related issues all of her adult life. In the same way that
those who had received the diagnoses, she also, after a period
of contemplation and confusion, expressed that having her
ADHD suspicions disproved had come as a relief.
The Significant Others
All of the 19 life stories contain narratives describing how
the participants ended up identifying with the ADHD diag-
nosis. In 2 of the 19 life stories, identification was the only
one represented out of the three main themes identified in the
study. The fact that the participants did not describe experi-
ences with any kind of problems or difficulties, and seemed
to have identified with ADHD solely because of their
acquaintances with the diagnosis, clearly makes these two
life stories stand out from the others. It is similarly quite
interesting that several of the older participants felt they had
not been perceived as different from other children while
growing up.
In the narratives of identification, several factors that in
different ways seem to have contributed to the individual
processes finally leading to a referral for ADHD assessment,
are described. Some of them are related to a kind of avail-
ability. The sort of availability in question, however, has
nothing to do with the geographical distance to diagnostic
competence. Several of the participants had to travel quite
far, repeatedly, to complete their assessments. Still, no one
brought up this issue during the interviews. The analysis
rather showed that the availability of "significant others"
seems to have had a decisive impact on the participants'deci-
sion to request an assessment for themselves.
Among those who most frequently appear as significant
others are own children, siblings or other close relatives,
and--especially with the younger participants--close friends.

The knowledge possessed by the participants about ADHD
from other contexts seldom led them to identify their own
problems with the diagnosis, and ask for an assessment.
Along with the significant others, the opportunity for a kind
of informal or direct contact with the specialist health care
services appears to make the diagnosis a more available one.
Social networks and relations to others with the diagnosis
stand out as important factors helping adults to seek and
obtain assessment for ADHD.
The significance of having children of their own with the
diagnosis and the significance of the adults' own ability and
will to persist in finding the cause of their problems are also
pointed out by other researchers (Fleischmann & Miller,
2013).
Concluding Remarks
The key questions of this article deal with how the ADHD
condition is manifested, and which factors, at different points
in time, seem to have affected the course of the lives of the
youths and adults prior to their referrals for ADHD assess-
ment. The analysis shows that the youths' and adults' life
stories are especially characterized by three themes: health-
related disorders and problems; diffuse sensations that
"something" is wrong with them; and by identification with
the diagnosis. Health-related disorders and problems seem to
cause comprehensive problems in the everyday lives for the
individuals. Even if this appears to be the most dramatic
theme, the individual life stories also contain narratives of
the other main themes. The course of events in a life story
that contains all of the three main topics typically starts out
with narratives of a diffuse sensation that something is
wrong. Next, there are narratives of health-related disorders
and problems. Finally, there are narratives of identification
with significant others' modified descriptions of the diagno-
sis. This identification motivates the youths and adults to
seek and negotiate their referral for ADHD assessment.
Furthermore, the study indicates that close, personal rela-
tions with others with the diagnosis may be of great signifi-
cance for adults getting assessed for ADHD.
This study has some obvious limitations. First, the ana-
lytic work is conducted by the author alone. All of the par-
ticipants have, however, been sent the results of the analysis,
and no one has made any critical objections. Second, the
study was conducted in a very limited sample, thus, the
results are not readily generalizable to a larger population.
Despite its limitations, the study does reveal some issues that
could be considered pursued in professional practice, as well
as some questions that could warrant further research. One
such question is whether the ADHD diagnosis will remain
the final explanation of the questions raised by the youths
and adults, namely, "why they are the way that they are" or
"why things turned out as they did."
Through the interviews, it became clear that several of the
participants and many of their close acquaintances were
relatively familiar with the diagnosis long before anyone
suspected that the participants'own issues could be related to
ADHD. The knowledge they possessed was based on the
descriptions from the diagnostic manuals. It did not comply
well with the adults'experiences of their own problems. This
may indicate a basic lack of knowledge in the general public
about the manifestations and consequences of this condition
in adults. In addition, several adult participants faced resis-
tance when requesting ADHD assessment from their regular
GPs. This may indicate a lack of competence on ADHD in
adults, as well as a lack of possible common comorbid prob-
lems, in the primary health care services as well. This is
another question that might warrant a closer examination. If
this should turn out to be a widespread issue, increased
efforts in raising the competence level in the primary health
care services could be useful. If no such efforts are made, we
may be at risk of a continuing under-diagnosing of adults
with ADHD.
Only a minority of the participants (2 of 19) in this study
got the diagnosis without experiencing any specific prob-
lems or difficulties beforehand. These were two of the
younger participant in the sample, emphasizing themselves
that the diagnosis has become very common, and that their
friends had it, too. The study sample is rather small, and
these two constitutes a small share of the sample (less than
1:10). Still, it might be of interest to investigate how com-
mon this phenomenon actually is. A relevant question in this
context is how one might explain that youths can be diag-
nosed with ADHD without fulfilling the formal criteria of
significant distress or interference with functioning. If this
should turn out to be an established practice, the consequence
may be an over-diagnosing of youths with ADHD. Perhaps
Therese's (19) story, describing a request for assessment to
disprove her ADHD diagnosis, could be interpreted as an
example of this kind of over-diagnosing?Aresearch question
that could cover all of the above-mentioned questions is
whether we are witnessing a diagnostic practice that may
lead to an over-diagnosing of youths and an under-diagnos-
ing of adults with ADHD.

1. Different sources alternate between quoting 1988 and 1987
as the year when "ADHD" (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder) was introduced as a term for a specific diagnosis in
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM;
cf. Baughman & Hovey, 2006; Brante, 2006).

 2. The largest number for users of ADHD medication in the age
group 10 to 19 years (i.e., 15,180 of 29,433 users in total),
according to the National Prescription-Based Medication
Register. Calculations based on figures from this register yields
an average growth in the total number of users of 147.82%
between 2004 and 2010. The corresponding growth in the age
group 10 to 19 years is 103.62%, whereas the average growth
for the age groups over 19 years of age is 361.40%.
 3. In his description of "the looping effect of classifying human
beings," Ian Hacking (2004), for example, points out that
diagnoses and conditions not only confirm each other but also
seem to mutually reinforce each other (p. 279).
 4. For a more thorough description of the sample, and so on, see
Hannås (2010).
 5. The quote is retrieved from a paragraph that speaks of valid-
ity in relation to narrative analysis. In my interpretation of the
author, the truthfulness requirement is as relevant both with
respect to the informants' narratives and to what may be called
researchers' narratives or meta-narratives, that is, my own
interpretations, reconstructions or analyses, based on the nar-
ratives of the informants.
 6. Compare, for example, Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss,
1967).
 7. A more thorough description of Labov's method is found, for
example, in Riessman (1993) and Fleischmann and Miller
(2013).
 8. The table may be subject to some inaccuracies. The categories
are defined and bounded, based on the terms the informants
themselves utilized in relevant narratives from their own lives.
It is primarily the terms and explanations of the informants,
not the formal definitions of the corresponding administrative
categories that form the basis for the categorization. Despite
eventual inaccuracies that this may have caused, I believe the
main features and tendencies that are uncovered in Table 1
cannot be characterized as misleading.
9. In the network theory of Bruno Latour, which among other
things describes how the knowledge of any given phenomenon
is confirmed and spread through a network of diverse actors
("agents"), such descriptions are described as different "trans-
lations" of the phenomenon under study (Latour, 1987).
10. In studies of chronic illnesses, a phenomenon called "medical
merry-go-round" is described. This term is related to a type
of activity connected to patients' and next of kin's search for
the maximum amount of information possible with regard
to their own illness and treatment. After hours of dedicated
information gathering through every available channel, the
patients appear to be experts on their own condition, able to
negotiate specific details with their doctors, both with regard
to their own illness, and relevant forms of treatment. Bury
(1997) describes this phenomenon in connection with the very
outbreak of the illness, especially related to the activity that
takes place after the diagnosis is given, and the treatment com-
menced. Furthermore, he claims that the activity decreases,
and the patients and next of kin usually calm down after a cer-
tain amount of time. In terms of ADHD in youths and adults,
however, the "medical merry-go-round" seems an appropriate
description of a process that takes place prior to the diagnos-
tic assessment for ADHD. The informants in this study, by all
accounts, could not settle down, neither with the diagnoses nor
with the treatment options they were prescribed before being
assessed for ADHD. This led to new rounds of sick leaves,
assessments, diagnoses, and treatments (cf. "medical merry-
go-round") before finally being assessed for ADHD.
11. According to Latour's network theory, the specialists in this
respect appear to be more effective agents than the general
practitioners (GPs) in the primary health care services with
regard to recruiting new members to the ADHD category.
The network of agents for the diagnosis is growing as a con-
sequence of more members being recruited to the category.
However, Latour points out another, unavoidable effect of the
same process. This shows that every new--and unique--case
of a phenomenon identified, simultaneously implies a modi-
fication of the phenomenon itself. Each new group of mem-
bers included in the ADHD category contributes to a need for
change in the category itself. Correspondingly, the knowledge
of the category must be subject to change--or "translation"--
so that it at any point includes every new and unique variety of
the phenomenon (cf., for example, the information brochures
from the specialist health care services; Latour, 1987).
12. Riessman employs the term key aspect when describing both
Labov's and Gee's models of narrative analysis. She states that,
in both models, the analysis implies a "reduction to the core nar-
rative" by using a "selection of key aspects." "Key aspects" are,
practically speaking, excerpts from the interview transcripts that
represent specific functions in a narrative (Riessman, 1993, p. 60).
13. Ida (42) was one of the informants who were interviewed both
before and after the assessment. In this context, it is interest-
ing that she, unlike some of the informants who received the
diagnosis, did not go on sick leave after the assessment.
