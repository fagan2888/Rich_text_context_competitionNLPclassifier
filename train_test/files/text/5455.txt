Introduction
The safety of the media and the fact that it reserves the right
to convey stories about any subject is uncontested in this day
and era (Voinea, 2015). However, the question is, to what
extent are the media free to discharge these uncontested
rights? Recently, media practitioners have become targets of
increasing physical attacks and assaults globally, and these
have recorded astonishing and unacceptable injuries and
deaths. Beyond their right to life and secured professional
environment, it tends to violate the right of society to infor-
mation (Elliott, Elbahtimy, & Srinivasan, 2012). In a report
of the Commonwealth Press, Ross (1999) stated,
"Conventional wisdom suggests that life for journalists has
become considerably more dangerous and difficult in many
parts of the world in recent years" (p. 5). These, among other
concerns, appear to have prompted the protection of media
practitioners from assault and harassment, which became so
pertinent that it received attention at major global summits
such as the U.N. Security and Human Rights Councils in
2006 and June 2010, respectively (Elliott et al., 2012;
Lissosky & Henrichsen, 2011). These resolutions, on one
hand, affected Africa positively, and cases of smooth state­
media relations are evident (VonDoepp & Young, 2013). On
the other hand, journalists in some parts of the continent,
especially those who carry recording devices to take photos
and video shots, are confronted with dangerous security
threats because they become targets for security agencies
who want to suppress footage of brutalities meted out to pro-
testers. For instance, cameras are either confiscated or
destroyed in such encounters (Keita, 2011; VonDoepp &
Young, 2013), as witnessed in the Liberian and Sierra
Leonean civil wars that saw 16 journalists dead in each coun-
try while many newspaper and radio outlets were set ablaze.
Also, justice was not served for the murder of editors Norbert
Zongo in 1999 and Deyda Hydara in 2004 from Burkina
Faso and Gambia, respectively, despite the efforts of the
Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA) (Karikari,
2011). In addition, the International Federation of Journalists
(IFJ) report indicated that the police (government) in the
Philippines had not done enough to prosecute those who
murder journalists because of 55 cases uncovered, only one
had been convicted over a 20-year period amid situations
where some police personnel were identified as prime sus-
pects of cases of murder. Prior to the demise of many media
practitioners, most practitioners had received threat mes-
sages through anonymous phone calls and texts (Noonan,
2005). For example, Norbert Zongo received several death

Intimidation, Assault, and Violence
Against Media Practitioners in Ghana:
Considering Provocation
Jacob Nyarko1 and Ufuoma Akpojivi2
Abstract
The ability of the media to function effectively as a fourth estate is hooked firmly on the maximum cooperation it receives
from the different entities within society at whose service it operates. Recently, concerns have been raised in Ghana about
the spate of assault and intimidation against media practitioners, and this action appears to hinder the independence, growth,
and development of the media. Using an inductive approach for qualitative data analysis and drawing on the provocation
theory, this study explored the degree of assault and intimidation in Ghana's media environment and found that attacks on
the media were traced to three major sources, namely, security agencies, communities/individual citizens, and supporters
of political parties. The article further argued that the communication interplay of the aforementioned entities is ideal for a
functioning public.

threats before his brutal murder (Tettey, 2001). The
Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) indicated that gener-
ally more than 94% of assaults on media practitioners were
not investigated at all (Elliott et al., 2012). This state of
affairs appears to suggest that most practitioners work under
fear, which tends to affect the independence and develop-
ment of the profession. Furthermore, in other places such as
Israel, Colombia, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Afghanistan,
Yemen, and Pakistan, assault and murder of journalists have
occurred between the period 2009 and 2010 (Elliott et al.,
2012), and these appear to have continued till present. War
regions are fundamentally dangerous locations and this puts
some media practitioners under more risk than others with
respect to fears emanating from serious injury and death.
Largely, journalists are assaulted and sometimes lynched
while on assignment (Taback & Coupland, 2006; Tumber &
Webster, 2006).
Ghana in Focus
Beyond being the first country to attain self-rule in Africa,
Ghana has weaved itself through different governance sys-
tems and made strides to stabilize democratic rule since
1992, a quality that has credited the country as a model of
democracy on the African continent. At the core of this his-
toric feat is a vibrant media, whose role has been indispens-
able to the sustenance of democracy up to today, and thus,
the need for them to work in a safe environment should be
sought. Ghana was ranked 22nd on the 2015 World Press
Freedom, which placed the country in the "free" category
(Reporters Without Borders, 2015). By the close of 2016,
Ghana's media freedom status worsened to 26th in the same
ranking index. Furthermore, in a compilation of freedom of
expression (FoE) violations such as arrests, attacks and
threats, fines, and imprisonment among 16 countries in West
Africa in the first quarter of 2014, Ghana recorded the high-
est cases (eight) of the 25 overall media violations. This
prompted the MFWA to issue a statement about the growing
spate of attacks and harassment on media practitioners
(Mordy, 2014). Subsequently, various media associations
and regulatory bodies comprised of the National Media
Commission (NMC), Ghana Journalists Association (GJA),
Ghana Independent Broadcaster's Association (GIBA), and
the Private Newspaper Publishers Association of Ghana
(PRINPAG), jointly conveyed a press conference in this
regard (Jafaru, 2014). For instance, journalists of the
Multimedia Group and TV3 crew were harassed by security
officers when they were taking shots of demolition of some
human settlements on purported encroached lands in the
capital to publish the living condition of residents after the
operation by the Accra and Tema Metropolitan Assemblies.
In addition, there have been reports of assaults on the media
by members of the public including active politicians. In as
much as media laws and the political orientation of a country
pose some challenges to the establishment of media freedom
globally, media analysts in Ghana tend to attribute the coun-
try's dwindling ranking on the World Press Freedom Index to
increasing instances of assault in the landscape. Similarly,
the United States attributed their drop on the World Media
Freedom ranking mainly to the arrest of scores of practitio-
ners--broadcast, print, web, blogging, and live streaming--
at "Occupy Wall Street" protests across the United States,
and the intimidation of other practitioners by baton and gun-
wielding police officers during a NATO summit in Chicago
(Madsen, 2012). Thus, it appears that the very society the
fourth estate represents as its mouthpiece is constantly
assaulting and frustrating their efforts in ensuring that soci-
ety functions well. To Tumber and Webster (2006), the
clampdown on media practitioners is an assault on democ-
racy. The current study subjects media practitioners in Ghana
to qualitative interrogation with respect to intimidation,
assault, and violence in the landscape, and intends to identify
their sources and the extent to which this informs their auton-
omy and development, public tranquility, and coexistence.
This would help inform policy on the general development
of media.
Literature
The critical function of the media to inform and educate soci-
ety, set agenda, and influence public opinion makes it a pre-
carious profession. For instance, amid the turbulent political
landscape of Nepal, journalists were threatened or some-
times killed for writing about a subject or refusing to do so,
and these plots occasionally extend to their relatives who
become targets for possible attack (Neupane & Zeng, 2014).
Arnaldo et al. (1998) observed,
It is equally difficult to understand how journalists can be
harassed, imprisoned, tortured or killed mainly for their
disagreement with those in power or for expressing opposing or
often just different views. Is it that those who hold power, or
seek power or who wish to preserve that power, do so at all
costs, even the cost of human life? (p. 6)
Thus, public office holders employ violent tactics such as
arrest and physical violence, to inhibit media practitioners
from conveying stories about armed violence and its reper-
cussions (Tumber & Webster, 2006). Moreover, the nature of
their job in many situations exposed practitioners to these
hazards because their assignments normally take them to
environments where the likelihood of violence breaking out
is high, such as the stadia, massive demonstrations, and pro-
tests (Bridge, 2004; Spiliopoulos, 2007) among others. Using
the provocative theory and drawing on a data set that spans
15 years and covers 23 nations, VonDoepp and Young (2013)
explained the state of assault and harassment of the fourth
estate in Africa from the perspective of what drives govern-
ment to stifle flow of information over time. They showed
that assault heightens in media when governments (a) sought
Nyarko and Akpojivi 3
constitutional amendment to prolong their stay in office, (b)
incites series of protests and (c) masterminds coup plots.
Neupane and Zeng (2014) investigated how Nepali journal-
ists have fared after the Constituent Assembly election in
2008 through in-depth interviews drawn from print, broad-
cast, and online media platforms. Their findings revealed
that beyond media freedom protection stipulated in the
Interim Constitution, journalists remained confronted with
threats and assaults attributed to what they write. Moreover,
security forces, minority groups, and media owners exert
pressure on journalists, and government has done less to pro-
tect them. The influence of religious bodies and political
fanatics are strong factors because coverage of sensitive sub-
jects such as religious beliefs and corruption have triggered
attacks on journalists if entities involved feel offended. The
fears of violent attacks make media practitioners cautious in
their reportage of these subjects, which eventually leads to
self-censorship (Hanitzsch & Hidayat, 2012). The state of
assault on media practitioners appears to be worst in conflict
zones, and writing on "A Story to Die for," Bridge (2004)
cautioned,
Prepare yourself mentally. Garner knowledge about where you
are going and what you may be faced with and seek out trusted
contacts and fixers in the country. And remember that common
sense is an important survival tool. And if it really does go
horribly wrong? Well, nobody forced you to be a journalist. (p.
40)
The position of Bridge reiterates the experience of Chris
Ayres of The Times when he found himself entangled with the
Marines during the 2003 Iraq Invasion and commented, "I
found myself in a circumstance where I was absolutely terri-
fied beyond belief since I just thought that there was a fair
chance that we'd die, or get captured" (Tumber & Webster,
2006, p. 19). Kodellas, Papastavron, Giannakoulopoulos, and
Koutsompolis (2014) examined victimization at the work-
place and the degree of fear of crime among media practitio-
ners using a sample of 635 practicing media professionals.
Their findings showed that physical victimization is common
in the workplace and journalists whose roles are "news sourc-
ing" and "photography" experienced higher fears of physical
and verbal attacks, threats, and stolen or damaged property.
Melki and Mallat (2014) used a mixed method to examine the
marginalization of female journalists in the Arab world and
theorized that a number of factors such as sexual harassment
and absence of enabling legal and social setting jointly dis-
courage, prevent, or push females out of the media profes-
sion. Moreover, females who have proved successful in the
job are assigned to roles that exclude them from decision and
policy determination. Their findings also showed that global
cultural and institutional practices dating back to centuries are
fully operational in media establishments in Lebanon and the
Arab world. In his paper, "Journalists as Citizens," Whittle
(2005) maintained,
We have to be free to gather news and views to serve the society
of which we, too, are a part . . . we cannot afford to be thought
of as an extension of the police service or the intelligence
agencies. We need people to talk to us. The public need to have
access to that information. The public interest is better served by
our being able to report what is happening and get inside the
minds of people. That becomes impossible if every step is
dogged with the threat of police raids and seizures of journalistic
material. (p. 54)
From the position of Whittle, freedom of media practitioners
to collect information from the public to help advocate the
interest of society is central to the media profession, and he
established that the media should not be misconstrued as an
integral part of the security services. Taback and Coupland
(2006) investigated security of media practitioners, and con-
cluded that media reports from conflict zones can provide a
meaningful database on the effect of armed violence on vul-
nerable groups, including journalists, to enhance human
security. They maintained that media documentation and
subsequent publication is the surest means to convey infor-
mation to the international community to influence policy
direction on human security. In Haiti, verbal and other forms
of abuse against practitioners in public are on the rise for
posing a question to public officials. Haiti's president Michel
Martelly ignored a question, and upon persistence by the
journalist, he remarked, "Look, if you persist, I'll insult you
and your mama!" Following this, a young female journalist's
question about unfulfilled previous campaign promises at his
party rally in July 2015, the president said, "I came to talk to
you; you must listen," and then he added, "W$%re! If you
want to have s*x, find yourself a man to!@ck you behind the
wall! I'm ready to!@ck you on the podium!" George Fortuné,
a Haitian journalist, was also assaulted violently in November
2014 by a policeman in the presence of a public official, and
the ordeal photographed as a threat to other journalists who
might want to cover the protests (Chery, 2015). At a forum in
Washington, These Times reporter Mike Elk's microphone
was seized and unlawfully detained by a Honeywell official
after he asked the Honeywell CEO about his firm's environ-
mental policies. In the recent attempted coup in Turkey, sol-
diers seized several broadcasting newsrooms and coerced
Tijen Karas at gunpoint to read a televised statement.
Moreover, while there are growing incidences of assault
against purported opposition newspaper Hurriyet in Turkey,
progovernment media practitioners also participated in the
campaign against the paper (Yeginsu, 2015). By this, politics
seem to have broken the formidable front of the media in
their effort to eradicate assault and violence on the
institution.
Provocation Theory
This work utilizes the provocation theory. Farrington (2011)
asserts that "provocation" is a "perceived attack on a person's
4 SAGE Open
or (his or her significant other's) property, security or self-
respect encouraging an unlawful response. It occurs in
response to frictions" (p. 218). Furthermore, Lord Holt in
1707 stated that four main activities legally constitute suffi-
cient provocation: "(1) hearing angry words followed by a
physical assault; (2) seeing a friend being assaulted; (3)
observing a citizen detained by force; and (4) seeing one's
wife in bed with another" (Mison, 1992, p. 139). Such as
other theories, the theory of provocation has become interdis-
ciplinary. In law, it is traced to the 12th century (Berman,
2011), and has also been applied extensively in the natural
sciences and the creative arts. Whereas in the natural sci-
ences, provocation encapsulates the introduction of a provok-
ing stimulus into a controlled setting to enable the investigator
to draw inferences about the features of the stimulus under
study, it is applied in the creative arts to provoke reaction and
emotions in the audience, or to activate new ideas and per-
spectives on daily practices and objects (Pangrazio, 2016).
Provocation may not always be direct. In the indirect sense,
persons can be provoked to aggression by social exclusion,
circulated rumors about them, among others (Warburton &
Anderson, 2015). But it appears that provocation is the most
singular activator of aggression (Bettencourt, Talley,
Benjamin, & Valentine, 2006). However, the terms aggres-
sion and violence have been misconstrued as being the same.
Violence is aggression that is intended to cause harm extreme
enough to require medical attention or to cause death. Thus,
all violent behavior is aggression, but most aggression is not
violence (Warburton & Anderson, 2015). Due to the nature of
provocative examination aimed to produce a response to
determine the effect of a stimulus (Pangrazio, 2016), breaches
of ethical concerns have been raised because participants may
be unaware that they are under observation. Writing on
Guardian Online, Chris Chambers (2014) questioned the eth-
ical basis of the joint study by Facebook and Cornell
University on "Emotional Contagion" because Facebook
users were unaware that they were being monitored. However,
the current study draws on past experiences of media practi-
tioners in the field to examine how the three entities men-
tioned above responded. Provocation is rarely used in the
social sciences; it enables the researcher to focus on how a
particular social phenomenon affects the individual and soci-
ety more broadly (Pangrazio, 2016), hence the need for its
application in this study.
By the use of provocation theory, this work intends to
determine whether the actions of some media practitioners
and/or the nature of their profession trigger intimidation and
assault on them by some actors in society.
Research Questions
Research Question 1: What are the sources of intimida-
tion, assault, and violence against media practitioners?
Research Question 2: What factors provoke intimida-
tion, assault, and violence against media practitioners?
Research Question 3: Should media practitioners be
blamed for their assault?
Method
Data for this study were sourced from individuals who could
comment constructively on the state of the Ghanaian media
with respect to intimidation, assault, and violence against
media practitioners under the country's fourth republic.
Informed consent was obtained from individual media out-
lets, associations, and regulatory bodies. Participants were
purposively selected based on the following inclusion crite-
ria: (a) participant is a qualified media practitioner, (b) par-
ticipant is at the time of this study in full-time practice, (c)
practitioner identifies with either the state or a privately
owned media outlet, (d) practitioner had a minimum working
experience of 10 years and more, (d) participating media
professional bodies should be advocates of media freedom
and expression, and (e) participant lives within the Greater
Accra Region of Ghana. For representative purposes, the
sample was composed of reporters who mainly go into the
field to gather news. This also includes editors and represen-
tatives of media regulators and journalist associations
because these bodies monitor activities of the media and are
the first point of call to report incidences of violence. These
criteria made them resourceful enough with respect to issues
of the media to critically comment on the subject under
investigation. Fifteen (N = 15) participants who met the
above criteria individually also gave consent to grant inter-
views at various locations of their preference. The study
adopted a semistructured interview design that enabled
informants to have flexibility to express their views beyond
specific questions in an exploratory fashion. Also, this inter-
view structure ensured that the core facts of an issue were
unearthed and the participants were experienced enough to
do. Questions include the following: (a) Have you ever been
a victim of assault in the field and by whom? (b) Have you
ever reported from a violent or crime scene? Who are those
involved and what was your experience? (c) In your opinion,
which group(s) of people normally assaults the media? (d)
What do you think triggers assault on practitioners? All
informants consented to have their verbal responses recorded.
Analysis
The study employed the inductive approach to the qualitative
data analysis process as hypothesized by Thomas (2003).
This approach is effective and convenient for analyzing data
and allows "research findings to emerge from the frequent,
dominant or significant themes inherent in raw data, without
the restraints imposed by structured methodologies"
(Thomas, 2003, p. 2). The use of a qualitative interpretivist
approach gave the opportunity for the researcher in the cur-
rent study to connect with respondents and to view the world
from their perspective (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). After data
Nyarko and Akpojivi 5
transcription of audio-taped interviews by the researcher, the
following processes were followed to guide the entire
research: First, preparation and organization of raw data files
was carried out where the imported electronic text was
cleaned using Microsoft Word. This involves overall format-
ting with respect to font size, highlighting interview ques-
tions and their accompanying responses to ensure clarity and
legibility, orderliness, and finally printing a hard copy.
Second, detailed reading of the text (responses) was done,
and the former stage made it convenient to be familiar with
the content and understand probable themes. Third, catego-
ries were developed by taking the study's research questions
into consideration. Categories were identified at both the
upper and lower levels of the coding process. The former
considered the general aspect of the study where six catego-
ries emerged and the latter, which is more specific, helped to
narrow down the categories into four. Fourth, text that over-
lapped at the third stage in the process of coding was recoded
to fit the four major themes and those that still fell outside the
domain of the research questions were stored in a separate
file for future reference. Final reorganization and redefini-
tion of the categories were undertaken but no subcategories
were identified in the responses. The process of thematizing
eventually turned out three major themes, and the findings
were presented narratively.
Result and Discussion
Assault and harassment of media practitioners in Ghana's
landscape emanates from three major spheres. These include
security agencies, communities/individual citizens, and party
supporters. Although the media operates autonomously of
the aforementioned entities, the regular flow of uninterrupted
information between the media (the fourth estate) and the
three major players is critical to their coexistence, and hence
the effective functioning of the media.
Security Agencies
Security agencies have attacked journalists (Foerstel, 2006;
Karikari, 2011; Keita, 2011; Neupane & Zeng, 2014;
VonDoepp & Young, 2013; Whittle, 2005), and the Ghanaian
media scene is no exception. Security men in their official
regalia attack media practitioners and confiscate and destroy
their cameras provoked by the following claims: (a) the jour-
nalists have caused obstruction at the court during proceed-
ings and (b) were taking photographs of persons who were at
the center of court cases. Although the informant reckons
that these attacks do not occur regularly in the landscape, he
concurs that some journalists were held at the office of the
BNI (Bureau of National Investigation) and released in the
evening for the alleged offense of "disturbing proceedings at
the court." Likewise, a female journalist was almost left nude
during the process. The office of the BNI in Ghana, like the
FBI in the United States, handles and deals with very serious
crime situations that require in-depth intelligence and inves-
tigations. By this, the detention of media practitioners at the
BNI instead of the police station shows the extent of media-
security services relations with respect to intimidation and
assault. This situation seems uncharacteristic of Ghana con-
sidering her growing democracy. The informant noted that
the sensitivity of an issue, especially those with high public
interest, determines the level of security interference in the
functions of the media.
Occasionally it [assault] happens. Some of my reporters were
beaten in court by state officials in state security apparatus and
cameras were seized. We were covering a case that takes high
interests. It was about a policewoman who had taken the state to
court and obviously it takes hard interest so we wanted to take
the photo of the woman and they prevented us from taking the
shot, seized our cameras and smashed them . . . Yes, it happened.
At a point they [the policemen] said we were obstructing [court
sitting] so they wanted to get us [journalists] out of court but
they couldn't after realising that would be a big mistake. Some
of the reporters were even detained at the BNI office for some
hours and released late in the evening so we [journalists] face
challenges. One of my lady reporters was virtually stripped . . .
Yes! It happened in Ghana.
Furthermore, another informant reiterated that security ser-
vices, chiefly the police, army, and "macho men," some-
times assault media practitioners. Macho men in the
Ghanaian context are "body builders" who due to their phy-
sique, are normally recruited as private security guards. This
informant explained an incident where official security men
escorting a foreign delegation to Ghana harassed and
detained a photojournalist at the police station because they
found a liquid medicine on him. Although these attacks have
also occurred at other places, the respondent also hinted that
there is an element of provocation from the media, and that
informs why security personnel assault them because occa-
sionally journalists go beyond boundaries set by the security
services and enter "no go areas." Considering the fact that
regular encounters between media and the security agencies
are inevitable due to the nature of their job functions, this
informant proposes a relationship that should be built on
interdependence so that in the event of misunderstanding, it
could be resolved to forestall future incidences of assault.
This reflects the theorization that conflict begins as a dis-
agreement, confrontation, escalation, de-escalation, and is
finally resolved (Botezat, Dobrescu, & Toomescu, 2007).
Although the CPJ revealed that 94% of assaults on media
practitioners are left uninvestigated (Elliott et al., 2012),
findings from the current study show that media assault
cases in Ghana undergo investigation, and in some instances,
security agencies render apologies whenever they occurred.
The comment below confirms:
We have had some instances where policemen or military people
or "macho men" have attacked and assaulted media people.
6 SAGE Open
Quiet recently, an Israeli foreign minister came to Ghana and
there was a photographer who was covering them and he had a
local liquid medication on him. Apparently the state security
apparatus had allowed it but when he went through the security
checkpoint, the security officers accompanying the visiting
delegation arrested and detained him at the police station after
being harassed. This incident underwent investigation.
Moreover, there were other areas where journalists have been
abused.
. . .
At times, journalists too will trespass and go to areas they have
been asked not to. Thus, there is the need for better relationship
between the security agencies and the media. I think regular
consultations will help build a good relationship between
journalists and the security agencies which should be symbiotic.
Once we have infractions and come to a compromise, I think we
could arrest some of these happenings. In the above incident,
both the Chief of Defense Staff and the District Commander of
Police whose station the journalist was detained at apologised.
In a related scenario, an editor of a media outlet explained
that though he has not suffered such attacks personally, his
reporters and other journalists have been victims. He
recounted an incident that occurred at the Independence
Square in which his photojournalist was cruelly assaulted by
personnel of the army. This incident generated into a major
issue and occupied the agenda of the said media house till the
military compensated the journalist. It appears that the media
itself, with its publicity function, wields the power to the
greatest extent to lessen and/or eradicate incidences of
assault because the perpetrators (security services, citizens,
and partisan groups) abhor negative publicity from the media
and will deter future attacks. On the Ghanaian National
Calendar, March 6 marks the country's independence from
colonial rule in 1957, and it is celebrated yearly nationwide.
This ceremony subjects the ability of media and security ser-
vices to coexist amicably to test. From the view of this infor-
mant, many media outlets in Ghana equally have worries
about the state of assault by security men.
Personally! No [I have never been assaulted], but my colleagues
and officers who go out on assignment are sometimes physically
assaulted. On 6 March 2013 at the Independence Square, one of
my photographers was brutally assaulted by the military and it
became a major issue that we had to take the military to task for.
We published a lot of stories about it and eventually our
photographer had to be compensated by the Military High
Command. Throughout Ghana, I know that other media
institutions have cause to complain about harassment from
public officials.
Journalists attacked by security officials and other groups
were often betrayed by the very instruments they work with
such as audio and video recorders. This is consistent with
other studies that showed that media roles, which involve
news gathering and camera handling, have a high chance of
being attacked physically, verbally, or their property vandal-
ized (Keita, 2011; Kodellas et al., 2014; VonDoepp & Young,
2013). For instance, in Uganda, journalist Joshua Mutale
who works for Radio Simba was attacked by the police while
interviewing women protesting against increased police
assault. Mutale commented,
I was recording the voices of the women with a recorder in one
arm and a set of earphones in another when a policeman I hardly
identified appeared and pepper sprayed me in my eyes using a
hand spray. I fell down and was helped by fellow journalists. It
was surprising that I was the only victim of the attack. (Human
Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda, 2012)
It appears that practitioner Mutale was the sole target of
assault because the equipment he carried easily betrayed
him. The advent of sophisticated miniature multimedia
devices offers a wide range of new recording experiences in
this age; however, the media still fall prey to the handling of
huge visible recorders. This situation shows that despite the
education of the security services in Africa by international
security forces such as the U.S. Africa Command
(AFRICOM), attacks on media practitioners persist (Keita,
2011).
The security services are institutions of government
whose training, besides defense, is grounded in both civil
and criminal laws of every land. In Ghana, for instance, most
people have "nick-named" the police and/or military "Aban"
meaning government because they perceive them as the
direct representative of the government within the society
and as the executors of the law. This notion of the public
seems to produce a positive effect of tranquility and coexis-
tence among society players, otherwise depending on the
professional conduct of the security services. Thus, when-
ever the law enforcement agencies (police/military) flout the
law and assault the media, the other civilian players (citizens
and party sympathizers) do not feel restrained from attacking
the media either in their encounters with them. Like Ghana,
many democratic nations across Africa and the world have
accorded the media a legally guaranteed status of "fourth
estate"; the 21st-century media practitioner could still be
described as a "lone-ranger" and unprotected because the
very state institution (police) they seek refuge in the event of
assault by other society actors are also perpetrators. This
appears to have created some sort of a "chain of assault reac-
tion" within the public sphere emanating first from the secu-
rity/intelligence agencies, then by ordinary citizens and party
enthusiasts.
Communities/Individual Citizens
Apart from public officials, especially security agents, who
assault media practitioners, local communities and individu-
als also attack media practitioners (Arnaldo et al., 1998).
Nyarko and Akpojivi 7
Although the informant below reiterated that such assault
and intimidation are uncommon in Ghana, they happen inter-
mittently. He recounted an incident where local inhabitants
of a community in the BrongAhafo region of Ghana attacked
a radio outlet on the claim that it flouted orders of their tradi-
tional ruler (King) who attempted to censor the program of
the station. Conversely, Ghana's fourth republican constitu-
tion provides for media autonomy and abhors any form of
censorship. The structure of African societies is such that
chieftaincy is at the core of defined communities, and the
massive loyalty, rulers command from their subjects, tends to
pose a challenge to the coexistence of constitutional and
chieftaincy authority. It appears that in such settings, refusal
to abide by the orders of the king is interpreted as disrespect
to authority irrespective of the supremacy of the constitution
and its position on said matters. Communities and/or some of
its members even go to the extent of occasionally assaulting
entities that criticize the sitting government because they are
affiliates of the party and feel offended.
Physical violence against journalists and photographers in
Ghana is rather rare. These attacks occur from time to time and
are typically isolated incidents. For instance there was a case
where youth attacked a radio station in Brong Ahafo region for
not obeying the orders of their chief [king] who apparently tried
to censor the station. Local communities sometimes detain,
arrest, or harass critics of the government.
The situation becomes even more challenging when state
officials do not condemn such behavior but rather take the
stance that further incites communities against media practi-
tioners. This threatens and aggravates their already precari-
ous working environment. For instance, in Kenya, Assistant
Minister Fred Gumo repeatedly commented, "Luhya jour-
nalists who write negative stories against leaders from their
community will be beaten." Speaking to journalists in Busia
(another town), the office of the President Assistant Minister
said his recent threat was not a joke and should be taken seri-
ously (The Nation, May 11, 1999, cited in Tettey, 2001). A
renowned Ghanaian politician remarked, power to rule
belongs solely to the kings but they have decided to sit on the
fence to give some leeway to democracy. Thus, the media
always suffers whenever the political front and chieftaincy
seem married.
The informant below identified the court as one of the
places where individual members of society attack media
practitioners because they take pictures of their acquain-
tances who are suspects in specific cases for publication.
This informant cited an incident at the court where Mr.
Agude, a former presidential candidate of the Convention
People's Party (CPP) in Ghana (the then suspect), assaulted a
photojournalist because he was taking a shot of him. To this
informant, apart from the security services, ordinary mem-
bers of the public also attack media practitioners because
they likened them to the work of the paparazzi (see quote
below). This finding is consistent with the definition of
"arrest, assault and attack" of journalists, as "physical incar-
ceration or harm, including--for example, death threats--
directed at journalists in the course of their work" (Ross,
1999, p. 6) without distinguishing whether such acts of
assaults were perpetrated by official or nonofficial actors.
Ross further noted, "A physical threat is a physical threat,
regardless of who administers it."
There have been situations where private people [citizens] have
had problems with journalists because they had taken
photographs of their friends or colleagues so they engaged them
in some sort of quarrel. Such incidents occur in court proceedings
where family members of a suspect engage the media in
unhealthy attacks because they think you [the journalist] want to
expose their relation. For instance, a photojournalist was
manhandled by Mr. Agude at the court. This scenario shows that
individuals also do assault journalists.
In related incidences, a female journalist and another pho-
tojournalist of a newspaper outlet were attacked just in front
of their office in Accra and Tamale, the northern regional
capital city of Ghana, respectively, while trying to cover a
confusion that broke out. This informant also narrated an
incident where colleagues of Castro, a Ghanaian music artist
who went missing in a river in Ada (a town on the coast of
the Greater Accra Region of Ghana), manhandled journalists
from Joy FM and Ghana Broadcasting Corporation claim-
ing that they had visited the town to take shots of them. By
this comment, it can be said violence meted out on media
practitioners while in the field have not stopped in Ghana:
A lady photojournalist of our newspaper was assaulted right in
front of our building when she attempted to take a shot of a
commotion. Apart from this, one of our photographers was also
physically assaulted and his camera smashed in Tamale. By this,
it is not only officials who attack media practitioners, but
individual members of the public also attack. Quite recently, a
Ghanaian musician got drowned in the Ada River, and some
journalists trying to report on the search for the artist after he
was reported missing were attacked by that same group of
people believed to have gone there with the victim. They
molested some of the reporters for coming there to take pictures
of them. So, physical violence in the line of duty is still on.
Furthermore, other incidences where individuals or
groups have attacked media were evident. For example,
Bishop Daniel Obinim, the general overseer of International
God's Way Church and another two pastors stormed the
premises of Accra-based Hot FM, vandalized and attacked
the program host and panelists on the claim that their discus-
sion offended and provoked him ("Bishop Obinim Runs
Amok," 2011). A female journalist, Afia Pokuah, who works
for Adom FM was beaten by Israel Kwame Layea and a
coworker of the Ablekuma Branch of the National Health
Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Accra; they seized her recorder
8 SAGE Open
when she went there with other journalists to enquire why
the registration process for the issuance of the scheme's iden-
tity cards was delayed (Sarpong, 2014). Also, Daily Graphic
Journalist, Daniel Kenu was attacked by Baffour Gyan, the
brother of Ghana Black Star captain Asamoah Gyan and
some groups (GIBA, 2017). Ironically, "where journalists
are most in danger is where journalists' work is most impor-
tant for promoting human security" (Tumber & Webster,
2006, p. 192). This appears to suggest that the very society
that media practitioners are devoted to ensuring their secu-
rity by conveying information about their plight to the larger
local, national, and international communities, are invariably
persecuting the media. Thus, on a continuum of interests, the
orientation of each society player is utterly different and an
understanding of these postures will help ensure coexistence
within the public sphere. Whereas the media has a public
interest objective, the other public, whose interests the media
advances, rather have a self-protection interest, shield infor-
mation, and react negatively on the least purported
provocation.
Party Supporters
Loyalists of a political party are another group of people who
collectively or individually have had encounters with the
media. Describing the media's relationship with affiliates of
political parties, this informant recalled an incident where a
colleague he accompanied to a press conference of the
National Democratic Congress (NDC) after it lost the 2000
Presidential elections was consistently interrupted and
harassed by supporters while interviewing a leading func-
tionary of the party. The informant explained that eventually,
they ran away because party supporters assaulted them with
pure water. "Pure water" in the Ghanaian context is potable
packaged sachet water sold at many vantage points and it is
demeaning to be beaten with it. From the view of this infor-
mant, there appears to be an element of media­partisan
alignment situation in the media landscape, where party
enthusiasts target and harass media practitioners they per-
ceive as critical of their government or flag bearer. In
Bangladesh, for instance, media and politics are connected
and violence against the media is perpetuated by the youth
wing of political parties when they perceive a report to be
malicious (Ross, 1999). In Turkey, the president's speech
against purported opposition media outlets provoked his fol-
lowers to storm the Hurriyet publications headquarters,
smash windows, and chant profanities (Yeginsu, 2015). This
is consistent with Lord Holt's 1707 argument that provoca-
tion is triggered by hearing angry words (Madsen, 2012).
Although brutal assaults of practitioners have reduced in
Ghana, members of political parties continue to assault them.
I remember I had a personal experience when the NDC lost
power in 2000. They [the NDC party] had a press conference at
the Trade Fair Center and I went there with a friend who was
then working with a Kumasi-based FM radio. At that time they
[the party] had lost the election and were bitter and against that
FM station. When this guy [my colleague journalist] began
interviewing a senior member of the NDC, I saw some of these
party enthusiasts heckling and pushing him so I tried to separate
them but they threw "pure water" at us so the guy [journalist]
had to quickly run into a taxi and I also ran away. At their press
conference when they know that you are a so-called unfriendly
journalist, you see some of the party supporters and members
heckling you. Some will even drive you away. In as much as that
kind of violence coupled with molestation and brutality has
become minimal, party people still harass journalists.
Criticality of media reporting informs the reactions of party
affiliates toward media practitioners. This informant narrated
three occasions where political party supporters attacked
media practitioners in Ghana. First, Peter Apesewu, who
works for Insight and is critical of the National Patriotic
Party (NPP), was attacked at the head office of the party.
Second, Raymond Archer, a former editor of the Enquirer
and also critical of the NPP administration, received verbal
threats and his vehicle was damaged by alleged supporters of
the same party. Third, some reporters at a press conference of
the NPP after it was defeated in the 2012 elections were
assaulted. Beyond these, whenever party supporters embark
on a protest, they assault journalists.
Sympathisers of the NPP attacked some journalists. One
journalist called Peter Apesewu with Insight who was very
critical of the NPP government went to interview the party
chairman, Haruna Sekou at the party headquarters and he was
attacked by supporters. I also remember that, Raymond Archer,
who was then an editor of the Enquirer Newspaper and very
critical of the NPP government was also threatened verbally and
some people suspected to be members of the NPP even attacked
his car and destroyed it partly. These incidences of assaults on
journalists went quiet until recently when the NPP lost the 2012
elections and some journalists going to cover a press conference
at the flag-bearer's residence were brutalised by some party
members. These situations also happen during demonstrations
by partisan groups.
The recurrence of attacks on the media after political parties
(NDC and NPP) lost elections is a caution to practitioners to
be extra cautious during and after the declaration of election
results. In Burkina Faso, the CEO of a private radio outlet,
Horizon FM, was attacked by party loyalists of the Congress
for Democracy and Progress Party (CDPP) triggered by
sharp utterance during the station's phone-in program dubbed
Sondage Democratique that enables listeners to contribute to
public discourse (IFEX, 1997, cited in Tettey, 2001). Beyond
this, generally, the job description of media practitioners
makes them vulnerable to violent environments such as the
stadia, protests (Bridge, 2004; Spiliopoulos, 2007), political
party rallies, press conferences, national ceremonies such as
swearing-in of presidents, independence day celebrations,
and reporting from war fronts. Due to the risky nature of the
Nyarko and Akpojivi 9
job while in the field, Bridge (2004) opined that one needs to
be ready mentally before becoming a journalist.
Recounting on the lapses of the newfound democratic
system in Africa and elsewhere on the globe, Karikari (2011)
reiterated, "the excitement of a new dawn of media freedom,
autonomy and pluralism was now turning into a nightmare of
fear, torture and the threat of death" (p. 141). In Nepal, secu-
rity services, minority groups, and owners harass journalists
(Neupane & Zeng, 2014). Also, religious bodies and their
belief systems, followers of political parties, and corruption
are complex subjects that spark attacks on media practitio-
ners. For purposes of safety from assault, journalists tend to
report cautiously (Hanitzsch & Hidayat, 2012), which affects
their independence and subsequently their development. By
this, provocation becomes evident in situations where people
hold divergent views. Thus, people or groups that share simi-
lar values and ideologies are less likely to be provoked and
vice versa. Debunking what seems to be the perception of
many people with regard to the source(s) of assault and vio-
lence against media practitioners, a senior practitioner
argued,
Many times we [media associations and regulatory bodies] have
issued statements that these [assaults and violence] are not from
officialdom. These are not official positions of the government
whether NPP or NDC but rather by organisations or individuals.
For instance, you will get a policeman attacking a journalist and
ordinary citizens do the same in a demonstration. I remember an
instance where some workers were demonstrating in Takoradi
Harbour and they picked up one Daily Graphic journalist.
Obviously, it wasn't the government that said they should do it.
So, this kind of intervention by people, yes, it happens once in a
while and we [media associations and regulatory bodies] try to
educate people that the media is not on anybody's side.
. . .
We have had instances where media personnel have been
attacked in the line of duty but it is also important to point out
that it is never the position of the government; sometimes, not
even by the hierarchy of the organisation. For instance, the IGP
might not have said that when journalists anger you beat them
. . . No! But some irresponsible policemen who are not smart
enough to know that they will do harm or out of overzealousness,
will go and seize a camera from a journalist because he [the
journalist] is taking photos of police people doing something
fishy. That [attack] happens but does not result in killing as in
some parts of the world. We are grateful it hasn't come to that
but sometimes there are physical attacks on journalists and
especially after every election, journalists were beaten.
To the above informant, assault of practitioners in the
Ghanaian context are not staged by the government or insti-
gated by institutional heads such as the Inspector General of
Police (IGP) but sometimes done primarily through negli-
gence by some police officers and other citizens during pro-
tests. Security officers assault media practitioners, confiscate
and destroy their recording devices to hide evidence of pos-
sible brutalities captured on camera. For instance, to hide
wrongdoing,
in April 2014, police in Kumasi arrested and detained Muftaw
Mohammed of Metro FM for attempting to take photos of some
personnel of the Police Motor Traffic and Transport Unit
(MTTU) who he suspected to be taking bribes from drivers.
(GIBA, 2017)
Despite the occasional incidents of these attacks, the
Ghanaian media has at least contented that no deaths have
been recorded compared with what pertains elsewhere
around the globe. In the United States, the Illinois
Eavesdropping Act makes it an offense to record actions of a
police officer so a media practitioner could face up to 15
years in jail for filming protests and actions of the police to
inform the public (Madsen, 2012). The perception that the
media is a spy for a section of society instead of being the
fourth estate that serves as the eye of entire society through
the execution of its watchdog role requires constant educa-
tion and conscientization of the public to forestall future
assaults. This is consistent with a study conducted by Whittle
(2005), who maintained that the media cannot afford to be
deemed as an extension of the security and intelligence
services.
The study shows that postelection assault and attack on
media practitioners are evident in Ghana especially from the
camp of defeated political parties and these possibly
prompted the need for both the NMC and the GJA to provide
guideline directives on reporting of elections (GJA, 2011;
NMC, 1993). In as much as the NMC and GJA require that
all acts of violence, intimidation, or attack against media per-
sonnel, their property, or premises are reported to them and
the police, the GJA further cautioned,
Journalists shall not report any allegation about or a dispute at a
polling station without a comment/reaction from the Electoral
Commission (EC) or the Returning Officer. Media houses shall
not allow or grant interviews concerning allegations against any
party candidate without providing equal opportunity to the other
candidate to react. Hosts of radio and television programmes
should intervene when unsubstantiated allegations are being
made by panellists or during phone-ins. (Guideline 16 of GJA
Electoral Coverage)
This guideline appears to show that the media and its
umbrella organizations to some extent reckon that an ele-
ment of probable provocation from practitioners is evident in
the landscape and that there is a need to conscientize its
members.
Instead of assaulting media practitioners, security agencies
should rather protect the media against attacks from citizens
and party supporters on one hand, and also protect the entire
public on the other to bring a "win­win" situation in their
interaction through information sharing. With this smooth
10 SAGE Open
interplay of coexistence, the following becomes evident: (a)
the media enjoys a safe environment to work and (b) the
media can easily approach the public (citizens and partisan
groups) for its most vital raw material ("information") with-
out which it has no business to exist. This is consistent with
the position of Whittle (2005) who explained that the public
is better served when the media tells them what is happening
in their communities by getting inside the minds of people,
and (c) the security agencies stand to benefit from firsthand
information (tip-offs) relayed to them by the media and indi-
vidual citizens (entire public) for its intelligence work with-
out which their relevance, like the media, fades in society.
Implications for Media Industry,
Practitioners, and Society
The work of media practitioners is paramount in every soci-
ety but the extent of their performance is dictated by the
cooperation they receive from the different facets of the gen-
eral public at whose service the media operates.Although the
Ghanaian media have made strides on the global media free-
dom rankings such as the Media Sustainability Index (MSI)
and Reporters Without Borders, the current study shows that
her landscape continues to witness intermittent physical
assault and harassment against media practitioners perpetu-
ated mainly by three major entities. First, the activities of the
police and other security agencies interfere with the work of
the media, for instance, they have been known to seize cam-
eras, tape recorders, manhandle individual practitioners vio-
lently, among others. The other level is supporters of political
parties who have attacked journalists because of an assump-
tion that some practitioners from some stations are hostile to
their party so they do not want them at their events. The last
group that creates problems for the media are alleged crimi-
nals and other citizens brought before the court. Journalists
covering court cases involving alleged offenders and other
persons have been attacked by the supporters of those under
trial when journalists attempted to interview or take photo-
graphs of the people who are being tried. The interplay of the
fourth estate on one hand, and security agencies, individual
citizens, and party supporters on the other hand, through
information sharing is a precursor to successful electoral pro-
cesses especially in Africa.
Media practitioners are susceptible to these forms of
attack because of the nature of their profession, which makes
their constant encounter with the aforementioned entities
inevitable. Basically, attacks on the media are rooted in the
perceived notion that the institution is a spy ("the paparazzi")
that meddles in the privacy of others instead of being viewed
as a strategic partner who contributes to the overall develop-
ment of society through their unflinching uncovering of
wrongdoings.
Some traces of provocation emanating from the camp of
the media are evident. The driving forces that necessitate such
actions are (a) the belief that media is not nonpartisan; (b)
media programs, especially those that host panelists some-
times discuss unsubstantiated issues that offend individuals
and/or contravene societal norms and values; and (c) the
media sometimes obstructs security measures because practi-
tioners occasionally go beyond marked security boundaries
during national events and other ceremonies. Tracking provo-
cation from the perspective of ethical lapses, Nyarko and
Teer-Tomaselli (2017, p. 14) contended that the media has
compromised the profession's own integrity and its indepen-
dence of working in an environment without fear. Moreover,
in Ghana, practitioners who carry visible multimedia devices
are the most assaulted and intimidated because their equip-
ment easily makes them stand out. The question of whether
practitioners should be blamed for assault meted out to them
transcends the three aforementioned provocative forces and
intertwines into the complex facets of society that cannot be
satisfied entirely at a point in time. This is because actions
and nonactions of practitioners still attract provocation. For
instance, Neupane and Zeng (2014) noted that practitioners
have suffered abuse, torture, and death for "publishing" or
"desisting to publish" a story (p. 88). Education of the public
is imperative in this regard especially with a public that per-
ceives security services as "government" due to their role as
enforcers of the law. By this, some sort of a "chain of accom-
modative reaction" develops, where if security agencies dem-
onstrate "accommodation" in all encounters with the media,
there is a probable chance that ordinary citizens and partisan
groups will toe the line. Despite the intermittent incidences of
assault of media practitioners in Ghana, overall, society
frowns on these acts to the extent that it receives massive pub-
lic condemnation whenever they occur and occasionally,
police authorities and individuals apologize.
