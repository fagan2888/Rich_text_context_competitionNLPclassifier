Abstract: This study examined women's video dating profiles to determine what their
advertised mate preferences revealed about their mate value and relationship interests.
Women created a one-minute long video dating profile for a hypothetical dating website.
The videos were content analyzed into four categories of stated mate preferences: 1) "good
genes" indicators 2) good resource investment potential indicators 3) good parenting
indicators and 4) good partner indicators. Long-term mating interest was positively
correlated with describing good partner indicators and self-perceived mate value was
positively correlated with describing good genes indicators. Short-term mating interest was
negatively correlated with describing any mate preferences while attractiveness was
positively correlated with doing so. Results suggest that women's advertised mate
preferences provide clues to their underlying relationship interests and mate value.
Keywords: Mate preferences, mate value, mating strategies

Introduction
Women's mating strategies differ depending on a number of contexts and individual
differences; however, the costs associated with revealing an interest in short-term mating
may inhibit women from expressing their specific mating interests and desires. Because the
characteristics women desire in a mate vary based on relationship context, the mate
preferences a woman articulates may reveal her underlying mating strategies. Furthermore,
because women's mate preferences vary depending on their mate value, stated mate
preferences may be a reliable indicator of her mate value. In the present study, women's
video dating profiles were analyzed to determine if her advertised mate preferences
revealed information about her 1) desired relationship type (i.e., short-term or long-term)
and 2) mate value.
Relationship Interests and Advertised Mate Preferences

Women engage in a variety of mating strategies and relationship-types, including
exclusive, committed relationships, serial mating, short-term sexual relationships, and
extra-pair copulations (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad and Simpson, 2000; Greiling
and Buss, 2000; Symons, 1979). However, explicitly revealing an interest in certain
relationship-types, such as casual sex or a short-term mating relationship, may be costly for
women. Because men value sexual fidelity in long-term mates (Buss, 1989; Buss and
Schmitt, 1993) expressing an interest in casual sex may harm a woman's long-term mating
prospects. Furthermore, women engage in indirect aggression and victimization towards
other women whom they perceive to be sexually accessible to men (Leenaars, Dane, and
Marini, 2008; Vaillancourt and Sharma, 2011). These costs may result in a woman being
less likely to explicitly reveal her relationship interests, particularly short-term mating
interests.
Women's mating interests may be determinable by assessing other, more subtle,
cues. Previous research has produced mixed results as to whether a woman's interest and
inclination towards different relationship-types can be determined after only briefly
observing her physical appearance and behavior. Early work found that strangers can
accurately assess men's inclination towards short-term mating after viewing a video of the
target, but not women's (Gangestad, Simpson, DiGeronimo, and Biek, 1992). However,
research examining facial cues suggests that both men's and women's faces contain
information that people use to accurately predict their mating orientation (Boothroyd,
Cross, Gray, Coombes, and Gregson-Curtis, 2011; Boothroyd, Jones, Burt, DeBruine, and
Perrett, 2008). In one recent study, observers viewed women who were video-taped while
interacting with a male confederate. Although the observers were able to accurately assess
the woman's inclination towards short-term mating, the researchers identified some cues as
misleading, such as laughing, sitting close to the confederate, clothing style, and physical
attractiveness. These misleading cues were correlated with observer perceptions of mating
orientation but not with the woman's self-reported orientation (Stillman and Maner, 2009).
The existence of such misleading cues may contribute to the varied success in accurately
assessing women's mating strategies.
A woman's advertised mate preferences may provide another window into her
relationship desires. Specific mate preferences are differentially preferred by women
depending on their relationship orientation. Women more inclined towards long-term
mating, compared to short-term mating, place greater weight on signals of commitment and
resource acquisition potential in a mate (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Townsend and
Wasserman, 1998). Women interested in short-term mating increase the importance placed
on sex appeal, muscularity, physical attractiveness, facial masculinity, and immediate
displays of resources (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Frederick and Haselton, 2007; Gangestad,
Garver-Apgar, and Simpson, 2007; Haselton and Gangestad, 2006; Haselton and Miller,
2006; Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005; Waynforth, Delwadia, and Camm, 2005). Gangestad
and Simpson (2000) hypothesized that because women are unlikely to be able to acquire all
desired traits in one mate, they favor traits related to investment ability in long-term
partners and choose short-term mates who display "good genes" qualities, such as physical
attractiveness and intelligence. As a result of these differences, attention to the specific
traits a woman advertises as her mate preferences should reveal her relationship interests,
even if she does not explicitly indicate an interest in a particular relationship type.

Mate Value and Advertised Mate Preferences
Women's advertised mate preferences should also reveal her underlying mate value.
Studies across cultures have demonstrated that women higher in mate value specify more
traits they desire in mates than women lower in mate value (Campos, Otta, and Siqueira,
2002; Oda, 2001; Pawlowski and Dunbar, 1999; Waynforth and Dunbar, 1995). Buss and
Shackelford (2008) argued that because women high in mate value are most attractive to
men they can afford to maintain higher standards across all categories of mate preferences.
They classified women's mate preferences into four clusters of characteristics: 1) "good
genes" indicators, such as physical attractiveness and intelligence, 2) good resource
acquisition potential indicators, such as ambition, education, and good earning capacity, 3)
good parenting indicators, such as fondness of children, kind and understanding, and
maturity and 4) good partner indicators, such as being a loving partner, loyal, and
committed to her. They found support for their hypothesis in a sample of newly-married
women who rated their desire for mate preferences in the above categories. In line with
their results, it is expected that women higher in mate value will describe mate preferences
across all categories.
Present Study and Hypotheses
The present study investigated if a woman's advertised mate preferences were
correlated with her relationship interests and mate value. Women created a video profile for
a hypothetical dating website. Their advertised mate preferences were coded into the four
categories hypothesized by Buss and Shackelford (2008) to test the following hypotheses:
H1: Short-term mating interest would be positively correlated with stating a desire for good
genes indicators.
H2: Long-term mating interest would be positively correlated with stating a desire for
resource acquisition potential indicators, good parenting indicators, and good partner
indicators.
H3: Mate value would be positively correlated with stating a desire for indicators across all
categories.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Sixty heterosexual female university undergraduates participated in the study in
return for partial course credit. Data from one participant was excluded because her video
did not record in its entirety due to equipment malfunction. The 59 remaining participants
ranged in age from 18-27 (M = 19.0, SD = 2.12) and self-reported their relationship status
as single (n = 40), dating (n = 8), exclusive relationship (n = 10), married (n = 0). One
participant did not report her relationship status.
Relationship Interests and Mate Value Measures
Participants answered two questions to assess current mating interests. Some
women were expected to be pursuing multiple mating strategies (Gangestad and Simpson,
2000), and a woman seeking both long-term and short-term mates may be interested in
attracting good genes in short-term mates and other characteristics in long-term mates.
Therefore, participants responded to independent scales to assess short-term and long-term
Correlates of advertised female mate preferences
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -386-
mating interest to isolate the unique relationships between mating interests and advertised
preferences, regardless of how many mating strategies an individual participant was
pursuing. To assess current desire for short-term mating, participants responded to the item,
"Please rate the degree to which you are currently seeking a short-term mate (e.g. one-
night stand, casual sex, etc.)" and to assess current desire for long-term mating they
responded to the item, "Please rate the degree to which you are currently seeking a long-
term mate (e.g. committed romantic relationship, spouse, etc.)." Both items were scored on
a 7-point scale ranging from "1-Not at all seeking" to "7-Strongly seeking."
Two methods were used to assess mate-value. Participants responded to one item
assessing self-perceived mate value (SPMV) that read, "What do you perceive your value
on the mating market is relative to other people of your same sex?" It was scored on a 7-
point scale ranging from "Very low" to "Very high." Because physical attractiveness is a
principal component of women's mate value (Buss, 1989; Buss and Schmitt, 1993;
Symons, 1979, 1995), third-party assessments of the women's physical attractiveness
supplied another measure of mate value. Five raters who did not take part in the video
collection process rated each woman's physical attractiveness. They viewed still images of
the women taken from the beginning of each video before they began speaking and rated
facial attractiveness, body attractiveness, and overall physical attractiveness, each on a 7-
point scale ranging from "Very Unattractive" to "Very Attractive." The average measures
intra-class correlations (ICC) indicated there was a high level of agreement between raters
on these items (face ICC = .86, body ICC = .89, overall ICC = .90). This allowed for the
use of the average of the rater's responses to the overall physical attractiveness question as
an objective measure of mate value (M = 4.15, SD = 1.23).
Video Recording and Coding Procedure
A cover story was used to encourage sincere participation and to assuage any
participant concerns that the videos would be made public. The recruitment ad explained
that the researcher was interested in creating a dating website for the university population,
and each participant would create a video as though she were going to post it to her profile
on the site. Female research assistants blind to the study's goals and hypotheses filmed the
videos and interacted with the participants. The research assistant expanded on the cover
story when the participant arrived at the lab, explaining that the researcher was deciding
whether or not to include video profile options on the dating website and the participant
videos would be analyzed to determine what information women convey. She also
instructed the participant that the video should be about one minute long and assured her
that the videos would not be uploaded to the site for public viewing.
After the consent process was completed, the research assistant allowed the
participant to view a profile (containing only pictures and written information, no videos)
on a mock-dating website created to convince participants of the veracity of the cover
story. The research assistant then provided her with a list of potential topics that individuals
often include in dating site profiles, such as describing their favorite books and movies,
how they like to spend their free time, their values and worldview, and what they want in a
relationship partner. The research assistant explained that the topics were designed to
provide ideas to the participant and she was not required to use any of the topics provided.
Each participant was filmed from approximately mid-torso up, in the same room,
with the chair and tripod positioned in the same place. Participants faced the camera with a
Correlates of advertised female mate preferences

neutral expression and when directed began their videos with the sentence, "Hi, thanks for
clicking on my profile." After one minute of recording, the research assistant signaled to
the participant to conclude her video and gave her as much time as she needed to finish.
The research assistant stopped the recording when the participant stopped speaking if she
spoke for less than one minute. For all participants, the research assistant offered to
rerecord if the participant was not satisfied with her video. Seven participants filmed twice
and in all cases the second video was used in analyses. The research assistant then left the
room to allow the participant to privately respond to questions about the website she had
viewed, her experience filming her video, and her relationship interests and self-perceived
mate value. Upon completion, the research assistant debriefed her and explained that the
cover story was designed to encourage sincere participation but that there was no website.
She also asked the participant if she had believed the cover story or had any knowledge of
the study's goals. Four participants reported that they suspected the cover story was not
true and was designed to make them behave realistically; however, no participants reported
any knowledge of the study's specific goals or hypotheses.
Videos ranged in length from 36 to 75 seconds (M = 63.5). Two coders who did not
film or rate the participants independently coded the videos for the presence of advertised
mate preferences in each of the four categories (for a list of characteristics in each category
see Buss and Shackelford, 2008). This generated four binary variables, each reflecting the
presence or absence of advertised mate preferences in one of the four categories. There
were three discrepancies in the coders' judgments that were resolved by a third coder. In all
three cases, the coders disagreed as to whether a woman was advertising a desire for good
parenting indicators or good partner indicators. Fourteen of the women did not state any
desired mate preferences (rather, they only described themselves and their interests not
related to their mate preferences). This was unexpected, and another binary variable was
created to reflect whether or not a woman had advertised any mate preferences at all.
Results
First, the correlations between the measures of mating interest and mate value were
computed to ensure their independence from one another, and the correlations between the
mate value measures were computed to determine if they measured similar constructs.
Spearman's rank order correlation coefficients were performed because of non-normal
distributions in the short-term mating interest (M = 2.07, SD = 1.46, W(59) = .74, p < .01),
long-term mating interest (M = 4.85, SD = 1.56, W(59) = .86, p < .01) and SPMV (M =
4.31, SD = 1.10, W(59) = .91, p < .01) measures. SPMV was not correlated with either
long-term mating interest (rs(57) = .12, p = .57) or short-term mating interest (rs(57) = -.04,
p = .75) and long-term and short-term mating interest were not significantly correlated with
one another, rs(57) = .14, p = .28. Attractiveness was not correlated with long-term mating
interest (rs(57) = -.18, p = .16) or short-term mating interest (rs(57) = -.20, p = .13).
However, attractiveness and SPMV also were not correlated with one another, rs(57) = .13,
p = .34.
Table 1 shows the correlations between choosing to describe any mate preferences
and the different categories of preferences, and mating interest, SPMV, and attractiveness.
Because some women did not describe any mate preferences, correlations were computed
between each of the measures of mating interest and mate value with the presence of
Correlates of advertised female mate preferences

stating mate preferences at all. Stating any mate preferences was negatively correlated with
short-term mating interest. Stating any mate preferences was also positively correlated with
objectively observed physical attractiveness.
The 14 women who did not state any mate preferences were excluded from the
analyses examining relationships between specific categories of mate preferences and
mating interests and mate value. Two correlations between mating interest or mate value
and any of the categories of mate preferences were significant. Describing good partner
indicators was positively correlated with long-term mating interest. SPMV was positively
correlated with describing good genes indicators. Upon discovering this correlation, the
good genes characteristics were further delineated into two major categories: intelligence
and physical attractiveness. SPMV was significantly positively correlated with describing
characteristics related to physical attractiveness, but not intelligence.

There were no relationships between the length of the women's videos or speed
with which they spoke and mating interest or mate value. Length and words per second
(WPS) were unrelated to short-term mating interest (length: r(57) = -.12, p = .38, WPS:
r(57) = .08, p = .57), long-term mating interest (length: r(57) = .00, p = .98, WPS: r(57) =
-.08, p = .54), SPMV (length: r(57) = -.07, p = .60, WPS: r(57) = .09, p = .50), and
attractiveness (length: r(57) = -.09, p = .52, WPS: r(57) = .21, p = .12). This ensured that
the relationships between the relationship interests or mate value and mate preferences
could not be attributable to women speaking more slowly or for a shorter period of time.
Discussion
The data revealed differences in women's advertised mate preferences associated
with their relationship interests and mate value. The hypothesis that long-term mating
interest would be positively correlated with describing good partner traits in a desired mate
was supported. This demonstrates that long-term mating interested women's advertised
mate preferences communicate their mating orientation. The relative youth of the sample
may explain why long-term mating interest was not correlated with desiring resource
acquisition potential traits and good parenting traits. The women in this sample may be
Correlates of advertised female mate preferences

concerned that advertising those mate preferences may make them appear unattractive, or
too demanding, to males of a similar age. Future research could benefit from examining a
broader age range of women to determine if and when these advertised preferences change.
The hypothesis that women interested in short-term mating would preference good
genes indicators was not supported. Researchers have hypothesized different functions for
short-term mating other than obtaining good genes, such as obtaining immediate resource
investment, ending a relationship with a current long-term partner in favor of a new one,
and engaging in a short-term mating relationship with the goal of converting it into a long-
term committed relationship (Greiling and Buss, 2000). Mate preferences should vary in
service of these functions such that assessing short-term mating interest alone provides
insufficient predictive value. Furthermore, short-term mating interested women were less
likely to describe any desired partner traits at all. Instead, they opted to use their time to
describe themselves and their other interests. Short-term mating interested women may be
better served by advertising themselves and their attributes to achieve their mating goals.
These results suggest that future research should focus on how the advertised preferences
of short-term mating interested women will differ based on the different hypothesized
functions of short-term mating.
Women's attractiveness was positively correlated with describing mate preferences
overall, although each mate preference category was unrelated to attractiveness. This
positive correlation supports the hypothesis put forward by Buss and Shackelford (2008)
that women higher in mate value will be more demanding in their mate preferences.
Interestingly, SPMV showed a different pattern of results than attractiveness. The non-
significant correlation between SPMV and attractiveness indicates that women's perception
of their own mate value was unrelated to their physical attractiveness. SPMV was
positively correlated with stating a preference for good genes traits. Women who had a
high opinion of their relative mate value were more likely to describe traits they desired in
mates related specifically to physical attractiveness. Perhaps these women preference these
traits as a misleading signal to their attractiveness. By being more demanding, they mimic
women who are objectively more physically attractive. However, their focus on physical
attractiveness is a cue that their SPMV differs from their other-observed mate value.
Limitations regarding the assessment of mate preferences, mating interests and self-
perceived mate value should also be noted. The single items assessing each construct may
not have comprehensively captured women attitudes and desires. Furthermore, women may
not always be consciously aware of, or willing to admit to, their mating interests or mate
value. Future research would benefit from reexamining the hypotheses tested here using
more comprehensive measures and measures that rely less on self-report. Also, it is
possible that the results of the present study do not comprehensively reflect women's mate
preferences because participants were limited in the time they had to prepare and record
their videos. Given the opportunity to consider all identified preferred mate characteristics,
these results may have been different. However, other studies using data sources in which
people generate descriptions of mate preferences have replicated findings of studies in
which people are given the opportunity to rate comprehensive lists of traits (Dunn, Brinton,
and Clark, 2010; Waynforth and Dunbar, 1995; Wiederman, 1993). Present findings
indicate that these data sources provide another method of accessing women's mate
preferences.

Identifying valid cues to mating interest and mate value benefits our understanding
of women's mate preferences. Furthermore, this study identified important individual
differences that predict how women will advertise themselves in a mate attraction scenario
and provides unique knowledge as to how a woman's advertised mate preferences in a
realistic mate attraction context reveal more about her than what she explicitly says.
