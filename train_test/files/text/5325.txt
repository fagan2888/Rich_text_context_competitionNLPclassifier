Abstract
Objectives: To examine retrospectively the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and
acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) at admission and AKI outcome.
Methods: AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) by !0.3 mg/dl within 48 h or
an increase in SCr to !1.5 times baseline within the first 7 days of hospitalization. Patients with AMI
were divided into subgroups according to their eGFR at admission and the development of AKI.
Results: This study enrolled 396 patients with AMI; 48 (12.1%) developed AKI. In-hospital
mortality was 39.6% (19/48) for patients with AKI compared with 7.5% (26/348) in those without
AKI (odds ratio [OR] 8.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.02, 16.39). The mortality rate was 35.7%
(five of 14) in the eGFR ! 60 ml/min/1.73m2 with AKI group (OR 6.21, 95% CI 1.50, 25.69) and
41.2% (14/34) in the eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 with AKI group (OR 12.62, 95% CI 5.54, 28.74).
Conclusions: AKI development was common and associated with mortality in AMI patients with
either preserved or impaired eGFR levels.

Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI; previously
known as acute renal failure) is a common
complication that affects patients with
various clinical conditions, such as

cardioangiography (CAG)5 and percutan-
eous coronary intervention (PCI).6 Recent
studies suggest that AKI is associated with
poor outcomes and independently predicts
increasing long-term mortality.1,7­11
However, few studies have investigated the
early risk of AKI with AMI.
It is well known that the diagnostic
procedure for AKI is not standardized.
Rodrigues et al.12 reported there are over
30 definitions of AKI in the medical
literature. This variability causes confu-
sion, making it difficult to compare results
across multiple studies. The Risk, Injury,
Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease
(RIFLE)13 and Acute Kidney Injury
Network (AKIN)14 criteria are most com-
monly used in the study of AKI syndrome.
Unfortunately, the existing criteria, while
useful and widely validated, are still lim-
ited. Hence, in 2012, the Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)15
Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI were
designed, to compile information system-
atically on this topic by experts in the field.
Definition and staging of AKI are based
on the RIFLE and AKIN criteria. In
short, AKI is defined as an increase in
serum creatinine (SCr) by !0.3 mg/dl
within 48 h or an increase in SCr to !1.5
times the baseline score within the first 7
days. The effect of pre-existing renal dys-
function on AKI and mortality with AMI
remains controversial.16­20 There is very
little information about the role of
impaired estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) at the time of hospital admis-
sion on the mortality in patients with
AMI-associated AKI (as defined by
KDIGO).
The present investigation sought to
evaluate the prevalence of AKI in associ-
ation with AMI, and to investigate the
association between a decreased admission
eGFR and short-term outcome inpatients
developing AKI, as defined by the KDIGO
criteria, in the AMI setting.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective study enrolled consecu-
tive patients admitted to the Department of
Cardiology, The Affiliated Longyan First
Hospital of Fujian Medical University,
Longyan, Fujian Province, China, between
January 2011 and December 2012, whose
discharge diagnosis was AMI (ST-elevation
myocardial infarction [STEMI] or non-ST
segment elevation myocardial infarction
[NSTEMI]).21 Study exclusion criteria
included: lack of at least two SCr measure-
ments at hospitalization; presence of
obstructive AKI. The institutional review
board of Longyan First Hospital of Fujian
Medical University approved the study and
all study participants provided written
informed consent prior to enrolment.
Data collection
Data collection was performed using a
standardized paper case-report form.
Collected data included: patient character-
istics, past medical history, final discharge
diagnosis, electrocardiogram findings,
laboratory investigations, echocardiography
changes, medical therapies, use of cardiac
procedures and interventions, in-hospital
outcomes and overall mortality.
After an overnight fast, venous blood
samples (10 ml) were collected into haemo-
gram tubes containing di-potassium ethyle-
nediaminetetra-acetic acid (1.5­2.2 mg/ml)
and biochemistry tubes. Samples were main-
tained at room temperature and tested within
1 h of collection. White blood cell (WBC)
counts and haemoglobin levels were deter-
mined using an automated blood cell counter
(XE-5000TM; Sysmex, Kobe, Japan), accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions.
Creatine phosphokinase myocardial bundle
(CKMB) and SCr were quantiEed using a
biochemical analyser (AU2700; Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). Systolic and diastolic blood
Liao et al. 1169
pressures were measured by trained person-
nel using a mercury sphygmomanometer.
Ejection fraction (EF) was measured
and calculated using ultrasound equipment
(HD7 Ultrasound System; Philips,
Eindhoven, The Netherlands).
Diagnostic criteria for AKI
The SCr at hospital admission and daily
during the coronary care unit stay was
available for all analysed patients. eGFR
was calculated using the abbreviated
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study
equation.22 Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
was defined as an eGFR < 60 ml/min/
1.73 m2 for >3 months. AKI was defined as
increase in SCr by !0.3 mg/dl within 48 h or
an increase in SCr to !1.5 times baseline
within the first 7 days of hospitalization
(based on the KDIGO criteria). AKI stage
was defined as follows, using SCr: stage 1,
1.5­1.9 times baseline or!0.3 mg/dl increase;
stage 2, 2.0­2.9 times baseline; stage 3, 3.0
times baseline or an increase to !4.0 mg/dl or
initiation of renal replacement therapy.
Non-AKI was defined as a change in creatin-
ine level of <0.3 mg/dl. Patients were
divided into four admission eGFR sub-
groups: eGFR ! 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 without
AKI; eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 without
AKI; eGFR ! 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 with AKI;
eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 with AKI.
Outcomes
The primary study endpoint was in-hospital
death from all causes. The secondary study
endpoints were the occurrence of in-hospital
complications including cardiogenic shock,
major bleeding, stroke and malignant ven-
tricular arrhythmia.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 15.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Continuous variables are pre-
sented as mean Æ SD or median (with inter-
quartile ranges) and categorical variables as
n (%) of patients. Baseline characteristics of
the groups were compared using analysis of
variance for continuous variables and
2-test for categorical variables. Univariate
and multivariate logistic regression were
used to identify the risk factors influencing
AKI, and the association between mortality
and admission eGFR and AKI develop-
ment. The strength of the association
between risk factors and AKI was expressed
as an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence
interval (CI). The following baseline clinical
and biochemical characteristics were con-
sidered in the multivariate procedure: age,
sex, history of hypertension, diabetes melli-
tus, stroke, prior MI, smoking status, sys-
tolic blood pressure, heart rate, anterior MI
(or not), heart failure on admission, revas-
cularization status and complications. In
addition, the following baseline laboratory
tests were taken into account: haemoglobin,
WBC counts, baseline SCr and eGFR in
successive models. Only variables with
P < 0.1 in the univariate logistic regression
analyses were used in the multiple logistic
regression analyses. Differences were con-
sidered statistically significant by a two
tailed P-value of < 0.05.
Results
This study included 441 consecutive
patients, 45 of whom met the exclusion
criteria and were excluded from the study.
The study was undertaken with 396 patients
with AMI (127 [32.1%] with STEMI and
269 [67.9%] with NSTEMI). Baseline clin-
ical and demographic characteristics of the
patients, grouped according to whether or
not they had AKI, are presented in Table 1.
Patients who developed AKI were signifi-
cantly more likely to be older, have hyper-
tension, and have diabetes mellitus than the
1170 Journal of International Medical Research 42(5)
non-AKI patients (P < 0.05 for all compari-
sons). SCr, peripheral WBC counts and
peak CKMB were significantly higher in
the AKI group than in the non-AKI group
(P < 0.05 for all comparisons). eGFR was
significantly lower in the AKI group than in
the non-AKI group (P < 0.001). Patients
with AKI were significantly more likely
than non-AKI patients to have a faster
heart rate and a higher Killip class (>I) at
presentation (P < 0.001 for both compari-
sons). Patients with AKI were significantly
less likely to receive b-blockers and angio-
tensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angio-
tensin receptor blockers than non-AKI
patients (P < 0.001 for both comparisons)
(Table 2). Patients with AKI were
significantly less likely to undergo CAG or
PCI during their hospitalization than non-
AKI patients (P < 0.001 for both compari-
sons). Patients who developed AKI had a
significantly higher rate of cardiogenic
shock than those in the non-AKI group
(P < 0.001).
Acute kidney injury occurred in 48 of the
396 (12.1%) patients; with 40 patients
(10.1%) in stage 1 and eight patients
(2.0%) in stages 2 and 3. The rate of AKI
at admission stratified according to baseline
eGFR status showed a significant associ-
ation with eGFR (P < 0.001) (Figure 1).

factors associated with AKI in the acute MI
setting are presented in Tables 3 and 4,

respectively. The eGFR < 60 ml/min/
1.73 m2 (OR 7.45, 95% CI 2.91, 19.05),
baseline SCr (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00, 1.14)
and Killip class !III (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.68,
8.55) were strongly associated with AKI on
multivariate analysis.
Overall, there were 45 deaths (11.4%)
during hospitalization; 26/348 (7.5%)
patients in the non-AKI group compared
with 19/48 (39.6%) patients in the
AKI group (P < 0.001) (Table 2). In the
overall sample, the OR of death in
patients with AKI was 8.11 (95% CI 4.02,
16.39; P < 0.001) compared with those with-
out AKI.
The influence of baseline eGFR and AKI
on mortality was examined. Patients with a
diminished eGFR and AKI at admission
had the worst outcome, with a mortality
OR of 12.62 (95% CI 5.54, 28.74; P < 0.001;
Table 5).
Discussion
The main finding of the study was that AKI,
defined by the KDIGO criteria, was asso-
ciated with in-hospital mortality in AMI in
patients, with or without impaired eGFR on
admission. Overall, the prevalence of AKI in
the setting of AMI was 12.1% (48/396
patients). Those with AKI had a substan-
tially higher risk of mortality than those
without AKI (P < 0.001).
Patients who have an AMI are at high
risk of developing AKI. For example, in a
prospective study of patients with STEMI,

Goldberg et al.1 found that 9.6% of indi-
viduals experienced worsening renal injury
(defined as a 0.5 mg/dl elevation of the SCr
level at any point) during their hospital stay.
Worsening renal function was associated
with an 11.4-fold increased risk of in-
hospital mortality.1 Another study defined
AKI as an absolute change in SCr levels;
the resulting injury was classified as mild
(0.3­0.4 mg/dl), moderate (0.5­0.9 mg/dl),
or severe (1.0 mg/dl).11 Using these criteria,
AKI was identified in 19.4% (7.1% mild,
7.1% moderate and 5.2% severe) of
patients.11 A large study evaluating the
influence of AKI on short-term outcome in
patients with AMI observed an AKI rate of
16%.23 When AMI is complicated by car-
diogenic shock, AKI may affect over half of
all patients.24 However, these investigations
did not strictly use the standardized criteria
for diagnosing AKI. Some investigations
used their own criteria to diagnose, while
others used SCr at any timepoint or at 7
days. For future studies, it is very important
that standardized AKI criteria are
used, such as the KDIGO criteria,25 to
allow comparison of results between differ-
ent studies.
The RIFLE and AKIN criteria also have
limitations. First, despite efforts to stand-
ardize the definition and classification of
AKI, there are still inconsistencies in their
application. Secondly, some AKI cases may
be missed. Joannidis et al.26 directly com-
pared the RIFLE and AKIN criteria and
found that the original RIFLE criteria failed

to detect 9% of cases that were detected by
the AKIN criteria. However, the AKIN
criteria missed 26.9% of cases detected by
RIFLE.26 Thirdly, the stages within the
RIFLE criteria, containing three severity
grades and two outcome criteria, are
ambiguous. In addition, in the KDIGO
criteria, stage 3 requires patients to reach
SCr > 4.0 mg/dl, rather than an acute
increase of !0.5 mg/dl (AKIN criteria).
This change brings the definition and sta-
ging criteria to greater parity, and simplifies
the criteria.
In this present study, AKI development
was common in patients with AMI and was
associated with an increased risk of mortal-
ity. Furthermore, AKI development was
associated with increased in-hospital mor-
tality in AMI patients. Similarly, a retro-
spective evaluation of the incidence of AKI,
based on the AKIN definition, in patients
with acute coronary syndromes (ACS; 53%
with STEMI, 41% with NSTEMI, and 6%
with unstable angina pectoris) found that
13% developed AKI: 8.3% had stage 1, and
4.7% had stage 2 and 3 AKI.27 In-hospital
mortality was greater in patients with AKI
than in those without AKI (21% versus 1%;
P < 0.001).27 There were some differences
between these two studies. First, studies
used different criteria (KDIGO versus
AKIN) and different patient types (AMI
versus ACS). This current study examined a
more high-risk population, with 51.8% of
patients being treated conservatively, 10.1%
of patients having had a prior stroke and
16.2% having AMI complicated by cardio-
genic shock. As expected, the in-hospital
mortality rate in this cohort was similar as
that usually reported for AMI patients,
which was about 4.1­13.2%.23,28
A limited number of studies have assessed
the role of admission eGFR on the outcome
of AMI-associated AKI, especially in terms
of short-term outcomes. For example, a
study evaluating AMI patients showed that
AKI, defined as a !25% decrease in eGFR
at any timepoint during hospitalization, was
associated with a higher 1-year mortality
rate.29 The conclusion was that AKI was a
risk factor for 1-year mortality, independent
of admission eGFR.29 Bruetto et al.28
reported that an admission eGFR of
<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 with AKI was signifi-
cantly associated with a 30-day to 1-year
mortality hazard (adjusted hazard ratio
3.05, 95% CI 1.50, 6.19) using RIFLE
criteria (AKI was defined as a SCr increase
of !50% from the time of admission in the
first 7 days of hospitalization). Most studies
have focused on the long-term mortality but
few on the short-term outcomes.11,23 This
current study looked at short-term out-
comes and for the first time found that an
admission eGFR of <60 ml/min/1.73m2
with AKI was significantly associated with
in-hospital mortality. This means that
patients with either chronic or acute renal
dysfunction are at a very high risk for in-
hospital mortality, which might reflect the
underlying mechanisms that adversely affect
both cardiac and renal function.
Associations between AKI and these
short-term risks after AMI have several
possible explanations. First, patients who
develop AKI have a higher prevalence of
comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and CKD, each of which
may increase the risk of kidney failure and
death.2 Secondly, significant differences
were observed in the type of AMI treat-
ment received by the two groups in this
study. For example, patients in the AKI
group were significantly less likely to
receive some pharmacological therapies or
to undergo interventional procedures.
Thirdly, AKI will directly contribute to
distant organ dysfunction through the
mechanisms of oxidative stress and inflam-
mation. This means that AKI severity,
using the KDIGO criteria, represents not
only kidney damage but also an imbalance
between the kidney and other organ
systems. Therefore, AKI defined by the
Liao et al. 1175
KDIGO criteria, has a greater effect on
mortality.
There are several points to be considered.
First, the prevalence of AKI in the AMI
setting is high and clinicians need to be
aware of this important complication.
Secondly, uniform standards for diagnosing
and classifying AKI should be adopted,
which need validation before using in
future studies. Thirdly, AKI is associated
with the early in-hospital outcomes of AMI
in patients with either nonimpaired or
impaired admission eGFR. Thus, it is crit-
ical to consider measures to prevent AKI as
they may represent a viable method for
reducing mortality in the AMI setting.
This present study had a number of
limitations. It was a single-centre, observa-
tional, retrospective cohort study and it used
the KDIGO criteria to define AKI, but
information on urinary output was not
available in the study sample.
In conclusion, AKI occurred in 12.1%
(48/396) of patients hospitalized for AMI.
This common complication was strongly
associated with mortality. The presence of
a low eGFR level on admission in patients
with AMI-associated AKI was related to a
poor short-term survival prognosis. Patients
with an impaired eGFR level upon admis-
sion, who develop AKI, require extensive
clinical monitoring. These results strongly
suggest that recognition of these risks and
the adoption of appropriate strategies to
avoid AKI may improve outcomes after
AMI, especially for patients with CKD.
