Incidence of Four-Generation Family Lineages: Is
Timing of Fertility or Mortality a Better Explanation?

Objectives. This article estimates the percentage of lineages that include four or more generations for a sample of the
U.S. population and explores how social status and race are related to lineage depth.
Methods. We assembled data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households in order to
estimate the proportion of adults in four or more generations for the Wave 2 sample (1992­1994). When necessary, we
used various decision rules to overcome an absence of information about specific generations. We examine relationships
between lineage depth and sociodemographic variables by using logistic regressions.
Results. The data show that 32% of the respondents were in lineages comprising four or more generations. Blacks and
individuals of lower social class were more likely to be in four-generation lineages, especially shorter-gapped lineages.
Whites and individuals of higher social class were not more likely to be in longer-gapped, four-generation lineages.
Discussion. The majority of the adult population in the early 1990s was in three-generation lineages. The verdict is still
out on whether population aging results in the wholesale verticalization of lineages. Social differentials in four-generation
lineages in the early 1990s were mainly due to differences in the timing of fertility, rather than mortality.
BENGTSON, Rosenthal, and Burton (1990) argued that the
``demographic revolution'' has led to an increase in the
number and proportion of families characterized by a ``bean
pole family structure'' or ``verticalization,'' defined as lineages
that comprise four or five living generations with each
generation having few members (p. 264). More recently,
Bengtson, Lowenstein, Putney, and Gans (2003, p. 2) wrote,
``We have added a whole generation to the structure of many
families.'' The belief that ``verticalization'' characterizes
current lineages is so strong that George and Gold (1991,
p. 72) conclude that it ``is probably the most consistent and
important change in family structure during the past century.''
Most of the evidence to support these contentions, however,
relies on simulations of intergenerational ties (e.g., Cherlin,
1992; Himes, 1992; Treas, 1995; Uhlenberg, 1996). The belief
that families now routinely comprise four and five generations
is widespread despite the fact that the limited empirical
evidence suggests that even four-generation families are
uncommon (Farkas & Hogan, 1995; Rossi & Rossi, 1990;
Uhlenberg & Kirby, 1998; Winsborough, Bumpass, &
Aquilino, 1991). The first goal of this article, then, is to
ascertain the best estimation of the percentage of lineages
that include at least four generations from the perspective
of a representative sample of adults in the U.S. population.
This article also explores social differentials as explanatory
factors in lineage depth. Mortality and timing of fertility are
responsible for lineage depth. It is well understood that in the
process of demographic transition, declining mortality increases
the probability of four- or even five-generation lineages.
However, disparities in mortality persist between different
social groups. Research consistently shows educational differ-
entials in mortality among men and women and among Whites
and Blacks in the United States. College graduates have lower
age-specific mortality rates than do high school graduates in both
the general level and specific causes of death (Elo & Preston,
1996). Such inequality may be attributed to income inequality,
access to health care, health behaviors, or other psychosocial
factors (Kaplan, Seeman, Cohen, Knudsen, & Guralnik, 1987).
Mortality rates are also higher for Blacks than Whites at virtually
all ages (Smaje, 2000). Elo and Preston reported that individ-
ual socioeconomic status accounted for only part of Black
disadvantage. Community characteristics, such as racial segre-
gation and poverty, also contribute to racial gaps in mortality
(LeClere, Rogers, & Peters, 1997). In light of such social
differentials in mortality, people of higher socioeconomic status
should expect to have a greater probability of being in four- or
higher-order lineages. Similarly, proportionately more Whites
than Blacks should expect to be in such lineages.
Although the relationship between the timing of fertility and
related social differentials has been well documented in the
literature, researchers pay less attention to its role in forming
great-depth lineages than they do to the role of mortality.
Education is found to be persistently associated with the timing
of fertility in the United States. Using data from Current Social
Survey, Rindfuss, Morgan, and Offutt (1996) reported that
women with college degrees postpone childbearing: During the
period 1985­1989, about half of the total fertility rate of this
group occurred after age 30. The desire for career-type jobs and
reliance on paid childcare played major roles in this shift. But
such a pattern was not observed among lesser educated women,
who had children at relatively young ages. Chen and Morgan
(1991) also documented that the trend in the substantial delay
of first births since 1979 only held for Whites and not for
non-Whites. The White/non-White divergence is dramatic and
sustained and cannot be accounted for solely by educational
attainment. A separate study based on a national sample of
adolescents aged 15­16 found that Black respondents were
about four times more likely than White respondents to have

ever had sexual intercourse (Furstenberg, Morgan, Moore, &
Peterson, 1987). Such race differences in the timing of sexual
initiation and fertility are affected by social norms, family
background (such as parents' education), neighborhood
socioeconomic status, labor market experiences, school envi-
ronment, and peer pressure (Brewster, 1994; Burton, 1996;
Hogan, Sun, & Cornwell, 2000). Consequently, in contrast to
the expectations related to mortality, people of lower
socioeconomic status can expect to have a greater likelihood
of being in great-depth lineages given their shorter age intervals
between generations. Similarly, Blacks are more likely than
Whites to be in great-depth lineages.
Socioeconomic status and race seem to be associated with
mortality and the timing of fertility in a way that conversely
affects the likelihood of being in a great-depth lineage.
However, the mechanisms by which great-depth lineages are
formed are different for Whites and for people of higher
socioeconomic status (for whom great-depth lineages are likely
to stem from longer survival of older generations) than for
Blacks and for people of lower socioeconomic status (for
whom earlier addition of younger generations is likely to be
the cause). As a result, one would expect that Whites and
individuals of higher socioeconomic status would tend to be in
great-depth lineages that have longer age intervals between
generations, whereas Blacks and individuals of lower socio-
economic status would tend to be in great-depth lineages with
shorter age intervals. The overall differentials in the prevalence
of great-depth lineages between social groups should be a net
result of these two competing mechanisms.
Three research questions are addressed in this paper: (a)
What percentage of lineages comprised four or more gen-
erations in the U.S. population in the early 1990s from the
perspective of adults aged 22 and older? (b) Are social
characteristics (social class, race, and family background)
associated with lineage depth? and (c) Is early fertility or
delayed mortality a better explanation of great-depth lineages?
METHODS
Data Source
Information available from the National Survey of Families
and Households (NSFH) Wave 1 (1987­1988, N ¼ 13,007) and
Wave 2 (1992­1994, N ¼ 10,005) was combined to describe
respondents interviewed during Wave 2 (Sweet & Bumpass,
1996). We defined the lineage depth from the perspective of
respondents. Ascending generations included respondents'
parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents from both the
father's and the mother's sides. Descending generations included
respondents' biological and adopted children, grandchildren,
and great-grandchildren. The respondent, not the lineage, was
the unit of analysis. It is likely that someone in an ascendant
generation would report a larger number of generations in his or
her lineage. A respondent may have no descendents, for example,
but, if his or her sibling does, from their parents' perspective the
lineage would include more descendant generations.
In order to determine the proportion of respondents whose
lineages comprise at least four generations, we required
information about the existence of someone in all of the
generations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. In both
Waves 1 and 2 of the NSFH, respondents were asked to provide
information about their parents, children, and grandchildren.
For approximately half of the respondents who had at least
one living parent at Wave 2, a parent was interviewed and asked
about the survival of the respondent's grandparents. Compara-
ble information was unavailable for respondents whose parents
were not interviewed. Even for parents who were interviewed,
no information about great-grandparents was collected. Looking
down the lineage, no questions were asked about great-
grandchildren. These limitations made it necessary for us to
make educated guesses about whether respondents with miss-
ing information had living grandparents, great-grandparents,
or great-grandchildren.
Estimating the Prevalence of Four-Generation Lineages
The lineage types into which the Wave 2 respondents were
initially classified take into account uncertainty about the
existence of specific generations. To facilitate discussion, we
assigned a lineage code to each lineage type (see Table 1). Each
question mark in the table indicates the possible existence of an
ascending or descending generation, the result of a living parent

not being interviewed or the absence of a requisite question in
the survey instruments. Using only information directly avail-
able from the NSFH, we classified 8,203 of the respondents
(82%) as having fewer than four generations; for 6,131 of these
(75%), at least one lineage is represented by a question mark.
These respondents had the potential to be in at least a four-
generation lineage.
We used evidence obtained from both the respondents
and the interviewed parents to estimate the number of three-
generation-or-fewer lineage types that was likely to include
at least one member in generations represented in Table 1 by
question marks. Table 1 shows the estimation method for
each lineage; the dotted line points to the estimate to be made
and the solid line refers to the distribution base on which we
made the estimate.
Respondents in Lineage Code 31, for example, had no
children but had at least one parent, at least one grandparent,
and a question mark for the great-grandparent generation
(because respondents with living parents were not asked about
great-grandparents nor were their interviewed parents asked
about grandparents). To estimate the number of the respondents
who had great-grandparents, we determined the percentage of
the respondents at each chronological age who had grand-
parents and assumed that living parents of the same age had the
same number of grandparents. In other words, we assumed the
age-specific likelihood for parents having a grandparent to be
the same as that for respondents having a grandparent. We then
cross-multiplied the frequency of parents for each chronolog-
ical age by the corresponding proportion for respondents who
had at least one surviving grandparent and summed the cross-
products to obtain an overall frequency of four-generation
families for this lineage type.
For Lineage Code 32, we estimated the number of the
respondents' parents who had at least one living parent. We
based this estimate on the age-specific frequency distribution
of parents and the age-specific frequency distribution of the
respondents who had at least one surviving parent, thus
forming a four-generation lineage. For Lineage Code 33, the
possibility of forming a four-generation lineage lies in the
respondents having great-grandchildren. Here we assumed
the age-specific likelihood of oldest children of respondents
having a grandchild to be the same as that of respondents.
For Lineage Code 34, which has the potential to be a four-
generation lineage from both ascending and descending
generations, we adopted a combination of the decision rules
applied above.
Although there are only two generations reported for Lineage
Code 21, because some of the respondents' parents were not
interviewed, there is a possibility that respondents' grand-
parents and great-grandparents were still alive. We applied
the decision rule used for Lineage Code 31 to estimate this
likelihood. Similarly, for Lineage Code 23, if respondents'
grandparents were alive, the respondents' lineage would
comprise four generations. Based on the age-specific distribu-
tion for respondents with at least one grandparent among
those whose parents were interviewed, we estimated the
likelihood of having a surviving grandparent for those
respondents whose parents were not interviewed. No
estimates were made for one-generation lineages (Lineage
Codes 11 and 12) or for lineages that included skipped
generations (Lineage Codes 81, 82, and 83), although they are
shown in Table 1.
Linking Lineage Depth to Sociodemographic
Characteristics
Unlike the previous estimates, which moved some rather than
specific respondents from one lineage type to another, the
examination of associations between lineage type and socio-
demographic variables required that each respondent be
classified. For both ascending and descending generations,
when information did not extend far enough, we used age to
make educated guesses about the likelihood of there being
a living member in a particular generation.
Focusing first on ascending generations, we assumed that
people who were aged 75 or older were the oldest generation
in a lineage. This assumption is supported by two empirical
distributions in the sample: (1) Less than 1% of respondents
aged 75 or older had a living parent; and, (2) of respondents'
parents aged 75 and older who were interviewed, only 4% had
a living parent. Based on the fact that only 3% of respondents
older than age 50 whose parents were interviewed had a
grandparent, we assumed that people older than age 50 who had
living parents did not have grandparents. For descending
generations, we assumed that respondents whose oldest child
was aged 15 or younger did not have grandchildren. We based
this decision on the fact that none of the respondents' children
had a child before age 15 and that less than 2% of respondents'
children aged 16 or younger had a child.
By applying these decision rules, we assigned 2,131
respondents in lineage types with question marks into one of
two categories: (1) at least four generations or (2) less than four
generations. By adding these 2,131 respondents to the 4,030 in
lineage types with complete information, we brought the total
number of respondents to 6,161 (approximately 60% of the
original sample). Compared with those excluded from this
analysis, respondents in the smaller, second sample were
younger, had more education, and included more men, more
Whites, and more unmarried persons.
In order to examine how race and social status are associated
with different types of four-generation lineages, we further
categorized four-generation lineages into shorter-gapped and
longer-gapped lineages by using the age of the oldest member
of each generation and calculating the age intervals between
any two adjacent generations. For each lineage (which may
involve two or three intervals depending on the number of
generations), we calculated an average age interval. In order to
guard against our analysis being an artifact of a specific choice,
we used the first, second, and third quartiles of the average
interval for this sample as thresholds to define shorter- and
longer-gapped lineages. For example, by using the first quartile,
we classified all the lineages with an average age interval below
the first quartile as shorter gapped and the other four-generation
lineages as longer gapped.
We coded race in four categories: White, Black, Hispanic,
and other. We used the respondent's educational attainment
(less than high school, high school, some college, bachelor's
degree or higher) to measure current social class. Measures
of social class background included father's and mother's
educational attainment (less than high school, high school,
LINEAGE DEPTH S101
some college, bachelor's degree or higher, no answer) and
whether the respondent's family had ever received any form of
public assistance when the respondent was growing up (yes,
no). Sociodemographic characteristics used as control variables
in analysis included the respondent's age (22­29, 30­39, 40­
49, 50­59, 60­74, 75 or older), gender (male, female), and
marital status (currently married, divorced, widowed, never
married). We report frequency distributions for these variables
in Table 2.
We used a logistic regression to examine how lineage depth
(four generations or more vs fewer than four generations) was
associated with sociodemographic characteristics. We applied
multinomial logistic regressions to model three possible
outcomes: being in a shorter-gapped, four-generation lineage;
being in a longer-gapped, four-generation lineage; and being
in a non­four-generation lineage. We applied weights for
respondents to all the statistical analyses.
RESULTS
The Prevalence of Four-Generation Lineages
Column Four of Table 1 presents the estimated number of
four-generation lineages for the entire sample of respondents.
No estimates were necessary for Lineage Codes 41, 42, 43, and
51; the numbers are identical to the original frequencies, which
are presented in Column Three. From the remaining lineage
types, an additional 1,429 were estimated to comprise at least
four generations, for a total of 3,230. This accounts for 32% of
the total sample. By using the decision rules discussed in the
Methods section, we categorized approximately one third of the
respondents in the sample as members of lineages comprising
four generations or more.
Lineage Depth and Sociodemographic Characteristics
We present the associations between lineage depth and socio-
demographic characteristics in the form of cross-tabulations in
Table 2. To save space, we only present the results on shorter-
and longer-gapped lineages when the second quartile is used as
the threshold. Blacks overall were more likely than Whites to
be in four-generation lineages (34% vs 29%). The decompo-
sition of these lineages revealed two opposite associations:
Although Blacks were more likely than Whites to be in shorter-
gapped lineages (22% vs 14%), Whites were more likely than
Blacks to be in longer-gapped lineages (15% vs 11%).
Hispanics and people of other ethnic groups had overall lower
probabilities of being in four-generation lineages.
Generally speaking, higher levels of respondent educa-
tion were associated with a lower probability of being in
four-generation lineages. This pattern is more apparent for
shorter-gapped lineages: the percentage of respondents in
shorter-gapped four-generation lineages declined from 22%
for those without a high school diploma to 5% for those with
at least a bachelor's degree. Except for a reverse at the level of
at least a bachelor's degree, the results also show that higher
levels of respondent education were associated with a higher
probability of being in longer-gapped lineages. These findings
hold true for the associations between father's and mother's
education, and lineage depth. Ever receiving public assistance
as a child was related to an overall higher probability of being
in four-generation lineages, an even greater likelihood of being
in shorter-gapped lineages, but a lower probability of being in
longer-gapped lineages.
Of the controlled demographic factors, respondents aged
50­59 had the highest percentage of being in four-generation
lineages (both shorter and longer gapped), followed by the three
younger age groups, without substantial differences in the
overall prevalence. The lowest percentage in four-generation
lineages was for respondents aged 75 or older. Women were
more likely than men to be in any type of four-generation
lineage. The married had the highest probability of being in

four-generation lineages, whereas the never married had the
lowest, with the divorced and widowed in between.
Racial and social status differences shown in Table 2 support
our expectations that Whites and individuals of higher social
status are more likely to be in longer-gapped, four-generation
lineages, whereas Blacks and individuals of lower social status
are more likely to be in shorter-gapped, four-generation
lineages. These patterns, however, are cross-tabulations that
do not control for covariates.
Table 3 shows the results of a logistic regression on the
likelihood of belonging to any four-generation lineage regardless
of generational gap. The results largely confirm the aforemen-
tioned findings, except that the family background measures
(father's and mother's education, and ever receiving public
assistance) were not significantly associated with lineage depth.
This may be attributed to the correlation between family
background and respondents' own characteristics or to the mix
of both shorter- and longer-gapped, four-generation lineages into
one category, which may obscure the effects of these variables.
Table 4 presents the results of multinomial logistic regressions
on three outcomes of the lineage variable (in a shorter-gapped,
four-generation lineage; in a longer-gapped, four-generation
lineage; with in a non­four-generation lineage as the reference).
Three models based on the first (22.00 years), second
(23.67 years), and third (25.67 years) quartile of the average
age interval as the threshold were included.
Although the results varied from model to model, the effects
of race and respondents' education were similar. Compared
with Whites, Blacks were more likely to be in shorter-gapped,
four-generation lineages than in non­four-generation lineages.
However, Whites were not associated with a higher probability
than Blacks of being in longer-gapped, four-generation
lineages. In fact, the first model shows that Blacks were more
likely than Whites to be in longer-gapped, four-generation
lineages. Respondent education was conversely related to the
possibility of being in a shorter-gapped, four-generation
lineage. The pattern echoes what is presented in Table 2.
Persons with a high school degree and those with some college
education were not statistically different from individuals with
less than high school education when it came to being in
longer-gapped, four-generation lineages. However, persons
with a bachelor's degree or higher were significantly associated
with a lower--rather than higher--probability of being in such
lineages.
The results were mixed for family background measures.
Higher level of father's education seemed to be related to
a greater likelihood of being in longer-gapped, four-generation
lineages, but such a relationship only holds up to the level of
some college. There is some evidence that respondents whose
mother had a higher level of education--especially bachelor's
degree or higher--were less likely to be in shorter-gapped,
four-generation lineages, which was similar to the effect of
respondents' own education. The association between ever
receiving public assistance and lineage depth is only significant
in the second model, in which receiving public assistance is
associated with a greater likelihood of being in shorter-gapped,
four-generation lineages.
The associations between demographic variables (age, gender,
marital status) and lineage depth were largely consistent across
the three models and reflect the patterns shown in Table 2.
DISCUSSION
The first goal of this analysis was to determine what
proportion of respondents in a representative sample of the
adult population was in a lineage comprising at least four
generations. Our estimate is that in the early 1990s, 32% of
respondents aged 22 or older in a representative sample of the
U.S. population were in such lineages. This percentage is
higher than the 19.3% reported by Rossi and Rossi (1990) for
a sample of individuals aged 19 or older in the Boston
metropolitan area in the mid-1980s. It is considerably higher
than the 2.4% reported by Farkas and Hogan (1995) for people
aged 18 and older for a pooled sample of adults in seven
countries including the United States in 1986­1987. However,
Farkas and Hogan considered only adult children and grand-
children and did not estimate the likelihood of four generations

as we did for the present analysis. The inclusion of countries
with very low birth rates (e.g., Germany and Italy) undoubtedly
also contributed to their much lower estimate. Soldo and Hill
(1995) reported that approximately 45% of respondents in a
U. S. sample aged 51­61 were in lineages that comprised at
least four generations. In the present sample, this age category
had the highest proportion in four-generation lineages, although
our percentage was lower than Soldo and Hill's (37% for the
second sample). The difference can be explained in part by the
fact that Soldo and Hill included respondents' parents-in-law.
For a study of three-generation families in France, Attias-
Donfut (2003) contacted a random sample of 10,000 people
between the ages of 49 and 52. Of these, 60% reported having
at least one living parent and one adult child. Although Attias-
Donfut reported that 45% of the respondents were in four-
generation families, slightly less than one third of those in
three-generation lineages were included in the next phase of the
study and it is not clear from her report whether the smaller
group of respondents was representative. The comparable
figure for this age category from the NSFH for our smaller
sample is 36%.
Clearly, among persons aged 22 and older in the early 1990s
in the United States, four generations or more was not the
statistical norm. According to figures presented in Table 1, the
norm was three-generation lineages, the category that captured
44% of the respondents even after a portion of the respondents

was reclassified as being in four-generation lineages. According
to Uhlenberg (1995, p. 24), ``The paucity of empirical data has
encouraged a misconception to develop that four- and five-
generation families are becoming common under modern
demographic conditions.'' We make no claim that the findings
presented here are definitive but, like the results of other
analyses, they seem to argue for caution when it comes to
assuming that demographic change translates neatly into
change in depth of family lineages.
In this article we also explored whether lineage depth was
related to current social class, race, and social class background
with age, gender, and marital status controlled. The analysis
revealed some important findings. First, generally speaking,
current social class was systematically conversely related to
the likelihood of being in four-generation lineages, and Blacks
were more likely than Whites to be in four-generation lineages.
Second, these patterns are even more striking for the likelihood
of being in shorter-gapped, four-generation lineages. Third,
educational attainment, which was the measure of current social
class, decreased the likelihood of being in longer-gapped, four-
generation lineages. Compared with Blacks, Whites were not
more likely to be in longer-gapped, four-generation lineages.
Although there is some positive association between father's
education and the chance of being in a longer-gapped, four-
generation lineage, the supporting evidence is relatively weak.
As stated earlier, two demographic forces contribute to the
formation of four-generation lineages: longer survival and
earlier births. Based on what is known about the links among
social class, race, mortality, and timing of births, we expected
more individuals of higher social class and more Whites to be
in longer-gapped, four-generation lineages than individuals
of lower social class and Blacks, who were expected to be
disproportionately in shorter-gapped, four-generation lineages.
The results support only half of this expectation. The differ-
entials in shorter-gapped lineages received strong support from
the data, but there was no solid evidence for differentials in
longer-gapped lineages. This may be because even though
individuals of higher social class and Whites tend on average
to live longer, they also have first children at older ages.
Differentials in four-generation lineages between these social
groups seem to be primarily a result of differences in the timing
of births, not in the chance of longevity.
The findings reported on in this article are a snapshot of the
early 1990s. The data do not describe a trend in the incidence of
four-generation lineages over time. Our findings may seem to
be at odds with beliefs about the role of longevity, or mortality
at large, in the formation of great-depth lineages. The long-
term trend in mortality decline, which is part of the general
demographic transition, certainly contributes to greater
lineage depth in American families, and it is tempting to
attribute social differentials in lineage depth to differentials in
mortality or survival. These findings suggest, however, that, at
least in the early 1990s, it is the timing of childbearing, not
increased longevity, that accounts for being in four-generation
lineages.
Incomplete data was a major limitation of this study. The
criteria we adopted to classify the uncertain cases were
conservative, and as a result we were able to classify only
60% of the original sample. Compared with the original
sample, more of the respondents in the second sample were
male, White, younger, and unmarried, and had higher levels of
education--characteristics that were significantly related to
lineage depth. An evaluation of the degree to which these
differences biased the results awaits the collection of complete
data on lineages in future studies.
The extremely low percentage (1%) of four-generation
lineages among the oldest age group clearly is an artifact of
the conservative criteria employed to categorize respondents.
In Rossi and Rossi's (1990) sample, persons aged 71 or older
had the highest percentage (29%) of being in four-generation
lineages, followed by those aged 50­60 (20%). In the present
study, respondents who had children and an oldest grandchild
older than age 15 were eliminated from the final analysis
because we could not decide with confidence whether a
grandchild had children. Undoubtedly, many grandchildren
older than age 15 already had children of their own. If we were
to assume that all the respondents aged 75 and older whose
oldest grandchild was older than age 15 had at least one great-
grandchild, the percentage of four-generation lineages for this
age group would increase from 1% to 67%. The exclusion of
these cases definitely leads to an underestimate for this age
group. However, the underestimate for the oldest group does
not cause significant changes in the findings of the regression
analysis reported in the Results section. To test the robustness
of our result, we assumed that respondents had a great-
grandchild if their oldest grandchild was older than 20, 25, or
30, and we repeated the analysis for each age with the new
cases included. The results were similar to those based on the
current sample.
Longitudinal data on complete lineages would permit
documentation of the changing incidences of various lineage
types and analysis of the underlying demographic and social
forces that lead to them. As Uhlenberg (1993) noted more than
a decade ago, ``There is nothing intrinsically difficult in
collecting information on lineage depth from a survey, but no
estimates for the population based on representative samples
exist'' (p. 229). Our hope is that the findings reported here,
which clearly are provisional because they are derived from
imperfect data, may lead to the collection of more complete
data in the future so that the issues raised here may be explored
with greater confidence.
