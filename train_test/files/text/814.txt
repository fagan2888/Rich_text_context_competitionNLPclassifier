Background. Gender differences in functioning among older adults have been well documented. Differential reporting
of functional problems by men and women may contribute to this observed difference. The purpose of this study was to
examine the gender differences in functional ability by comparing self-reported function to observed performance of
physical tasks.
Methods. In 1988, 1,458 men and women ages 71 and older from the New Haven site of the Established Populations
for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) self-reported activities of daily living (ADL) disability and
functional limitations. Subjects' ability to perform 7 tasks was observed. Gender differentials in "accurate" and
"inaccurate" reporting were determined by examining comparable self-reports and performance measures. Logistic
regression determined how much of the gender differential in self-reported function was explained by performance
ability.
Results. More women than men reported disability and functional limitation, and women had poorer performance
scores for every task. Compared to similar performance items, self-reports of function were accurate for the majority of
men and women. However, among those who inaccurately reported function, more men than women underreported
disability and more women than men overreported disability. Overall performance explains all of the gender difference in
ADL disability and most of the difference in functional limitation.
Conclusions. These results suggest that both men and women generally report their disability accurately, and women's
higher prevalence of reported functional problems is probably a reflection of true disability for most disability measures.
GENDER differences in function among older adults are
well known, but not well understood. Women consis-
tently report more functional problems than men (1-8).
Several reasons for this gender difference have been hypoth-
esized. One hypothesis posits that the gender difference in
function is due to women's greater prevalence of nonfatal
but disabling conditions and diseases, such as arthritis and
migraine headaches (2,3,9,10). Verbrugge and Balaban (11)
have shown that more nonfatal conditions contribute to
women's disability, whereas men's disability is associated
with life-threatening disease. Although chronic conditions
account for some of the gender differential in function, a
substantial difference remains unexplained (12).
Another possible explanation for observed gender differ-
ences in function is differential reporting of functional prob-
lems by men and women; in other words, reported functional
problems may inaccurately reflect real functional deficits.
Most clinical and epidemiological studies of function among
older adults utilize patient or subject self-reports of func-
tional status, such as activities of daily living (ADLs),
instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and func-
tional limitations. A number of investigators have hypothe-
sized that women are more likely to interpret physical
discomforts as symptoms and have a greater tendency to
recall and report those symptoms (2,13-15). Gender differ-
ences in reported morbidity and disability may stem from
differential perceptions of symptoms between men and
women (1-3,10). Women are typically more involved with
health and health care all their lives than men; females are
generally socialized to pay attention to and acknowledge
pain and discomfort, while males are socialized to ignore
physical discomfort (10). Tests of these hypotheses are
sparse, and none have focused on disability.
Guralnik et al. (16) suggest that the assessment of func-
tional disability can be improved if researchers and clini-
cians use objective physical performance measures to sup-
plement the traditional self-reports of disability. They
reviewed the few studies to date that made such comparisons
and found good correlation between self-reports and perfor-
mance. They note that performance tests can overcome some
of the limitations of self-reports, such as respondent report-
ing bias due to perceptions of socially acceptable or appro-
priate responses, and performance tests are less influenced
by culture, language, and education level.
A few recent studies have compared self-reports to perfor-
mance of tasks, but none have addressed gender differences.
For example, Elam et al. (17) compared patients' self-
reported ADL disability with family member and physician
assessment of ADL and with performance of ADL tasks.
Patients' self-reports were similar to their ability to perform
tasks; however, compared to task performance, patients
slightly overrated their ability. Defining performance as the
M19

standard, the authors found that patients were most accurate
in their assessment of disability, followed by family member
and physician. Another study comparing self-reported ADL
disability with performed ADL tasks found that among
discrepancies between the two measurements of ADL, 89%
of the subjects ranked their disability greater than observed
performance indicated (18).
Though the studies that have examined the correlation
between self-reported functional status and performance mea-
sures have found generally good agreement between mea-
sures, there are some discrepancies. Examining those dis-
crepancies more closely provides a means to test the theory
that gender differences in the way functional problems are
reported contribute to observed gender differences in func-
tion. Specifically, when compared with performance mea-
sures, women may overestimate and report more, while men
may underestimate and report fewer functional problems.
The purpose of this study was to examine gender differ-
ences in the reporting of functional problems. We examined
self-reported ADL disability and functional limitation in
relation to actual performance measures. Three specific
questions are asked: Do women report more disability and
have poorer performance scores than men? Comparing re-
ported disability to specific performance tasks, do women
have higher false positives (overreporting of disability) than
men, and do men have higher false negatives (underreport-
ing of disability) than women? Do problems performing
physical tasks contribute to the reported gender differential
in disability?
METHODS
Data. -- Data are drawn from the 1988 annual interview
of the New Haven site of the National Institute on Aging's
Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the
Elderly (EPESE). The New Haven EPESE is a community-
based sample of noninstitutionalized men and women aged
65 and older who lived in the New Haven, Connecticut, area
in 1982. The cohort is based on a stratified probability
sample of three distinct housing strata: general community
housing, age-restricted private housing for the elderly, and
age- and income-restricted public housing for the elderly.
The sampling design has been described in detail elsewhere
(19). Weighted data from this sample, adjusted for oversam-
pling in the two age-restricted strata, provide population
estimates for the noninstitutionalized elderly population of
New Haven. The analyses presented here are based on the
1988 interview data, as it is the only wave of EPESE to
include performance-based measures of function.
In 1988, 1,795 cohort members were alive and recon-
tacted. Of these, 1,491 had complete (95%) or partially
complete (5%) interviews (172 proxy responses, 127 inter-
view refusals, and 5 persons lost to follow-up), for a re-
sponse rate of 83%. Thirty-three of the partially complete
interviews were missing both self-reported function and
performance data and thus were excluded from analyses.
Sample size for this study is 1,458 (32% men, 68% women).
Variable measurement. -- Self-reported functional status
is measured by activities of daily living (ADLs) and func-
tional limitations. Ability in seven ADLs was ascertained
using a modified version of the Katz ADL (20). Respondents
were asked if they were able to bathe, groom, eat, dress,
walk across a room, use a toilet, and transfer from a bed to a
chair without help. Each item is scored dichotomously: does
not need help, needs help, or is unable. A two-level ADL
summary disability measure is constructed: needs no help
with any ADL versus needs help with or is unable to do one
or more ADLs. The ADL summary measure is dichotomized
to represent ability or any disability in the realm of personal
care.
Functional limitations were ascertained in two ways: three
items were adopted from an instrument developed by Rosow
and Breslau (21) and five items came from an instrument
developed by Nagi (22). For this study, the Rosow and
Breslau items are defined as gross mobility limitations, and
the Nagi items are defined as range-of-motion limitations.
Gross mobility limitation items include ability to do heavy
housework, walk up and down stairs, and walk half a mile
without help. Two-level variables indicate score for each
item: able, unable. A summary gross mobility limitation
item is categorized as no limitation for any item versus
inability for one or more of these items. Range-of-motion
(ROM) limitation is measured by respondent degree of
difficulty (none, a little, some, a lot, unable) to push or pull a
large object, carry 10 pounds, raise arms above shoulders,
write or handle small objects, and stoop, crouch, or kneel.
Each item is scored dichotomously: has little or no difficulty,
has some or a lot of difficulty, or is unable. Summarized
ROM limitation is categorized as little or no difficulty with
all items versus some or a lot of difficulty or inability with
one or more items. The gross mobility and ROM limitation
summary items represent ability or any disability in the
general functional areas of mobility and range of motion.
Respondents were asked to perform a number of physical
tasks related to balance, gait, and lower and upper extremity
movement. Balance comprised three measures. Respon-
dents were first asked to hold a semi-tandem stand (i.e., ball
of one foot to heel of other foot) for 10 seconds. If able to
successfully perform this task, they were asked to hold a
tandem stand (i.e., ball of one foot to toe of other foot) for 10
seconds. If respondents were unable to hold the semi-tandem
stand for 10 seconds, they were asked to stand with their feet
side by side for 10 seconds. Each balance measure was
coded dichotomously, indicating ability to hold each stand
for 10 seconds. Those who tried but were unable to hold a
stand at all or who were not asked to attempt to hold a stand
for safety reasons were coded as unable. A balance summary
measure adds the score of the 3 stands and ranges in value
from 0-2: 0 = inability to hold any stand for 10 seconds; 1
= ability to hold either the semi-tandem or the side-by-side
stand for 10 seconds; and 2 = ability to hold both the semi-
tandem and tandem stands for 10 seconds.
Respondents were timed as they walked 8 feet and back,
and allowed any aid (e.g., cane or walker) normally used, if
needed. Walking score is number of seconds to complete the
walk. For those who only walked one way (n = 2), walk is
scored as number of seconds doubled plus an additional 10%
of that time. A 3-level walking summary was constructed,
ranging in score from 0 to 2: 0 = inability to walk or walk
GENDER DIFFERENCES IN DISABILITY M21
not attempted; 1 = slower walking times (> median time);
and 2 = quicker times (=£ median time).
Lower extremity strength was assessed by ability to rise
from a chair 5 consecutive times without use of arms; due to
unavailability of a suitable chair, 102 respondents were not
asked to perform this task. Initially, respondents were asked
to stand once from a sitting position without using arms to
push off. A dichotomous measure indicates ability to rise
once from a chair. If the single chair rise was successfully
completed, respondents were timed while rising from the
chair in the same manner 5 consecutive times. A 2-level
measure distinguishes between ability to complete 5 rises
and completing 4 or fewer rises. Time to complete consecu-
tive rises represents overall score. A 3-level chair-rise sum-
mary measure ranges from 0 to 2: 0 = inability to perform a
single chair rise, performed 4 or fewer consecutive rises,
tried but was unable, or did not attempt; 1 = slower chair
times (> median time); and 2 = quicker times (^ median
time).
Upper extremity dexterity was assessed by respondents'
ability to rotate their shoulders. Respondents placed both
hands behind their head, at ear level, with fingers touching,
and tried to raise their arms up parallel to the floor, pointing
elbows out to the side. For each shoulder, performance is
scored as completely able, partially able, or unable to per-
form the task. Those who did not attempt are scored unable.
Correlation between scores for right and left shoulders is
nearly perfect (R = .97). Thus, only one shoulder score (the
higher score) is utilized in analyses as a 3-level measure: 0
= unable, 1 = partially complete rotation, 2 = complete
rotation.
An overall summary measure of all performance tasks was
constructed by adding the four individual summary items.
The physical performance measure ranges in value from 0
--
8, with lower scores indicating poorer performance. While
this summary measure is based on the tasks performed, it
may also serve as a crude measure of general performance
ability (e.g., those with very low scores [trouble with all
tasks] are likely to have trouble with other, untested tasks).
Refusal rates for task performance (those who refuse may
be more disabled) and resulting potential bias are of concern.
However, range of refusal rates among tasks is quite low:
0.4-1.5% (men) and 1.3-3.9% (women). In addition, dis-
tribution of refusals over self-reported disability is reasona-
bly even. Among both men and women who refused to
perform tasks, slightly less than half reported ADL disabil-
ity, and slightly more than half reported gross mobility or
ROM limitation. Thus, resulting bias from these refusals is
minimal.
Analytic strategy. -- Prevalence of reported functional
deficits and performance ability for men and women are
described; chi-square and Mests determine significance of
gender differences.
Comparisons are made between 3 self-reported function
measures and comparable tasks: (a) reported ability to walk
across a room (an ADL item) with ability to walk 8 feet and
back; (b) reported difficulty stooping, crouching, or kneel-
ing (ROM limitation item) with ability to perform consecu-
tive rises from chair; and (c) reported difficulty reaching or
extending arms above head (ROM limitation item) with
ability to rotate shoulders. For these analyses, performance
of task is considered the "true positive"; to determine
accuracy of reported functional problems, sensitivity and
specificity (and, conversely, false negative and false positive
proportions) are calculated for each comparison. Log-linear
analyses provide significance testing for gender differences
in comparisons of self-reported function and performance
measures. Since we are interested in the difference that
exists between men and women for false negative and false
positive reports of disability, this test of association is
appropriate because it allows for the testing of all individual
and interaction terms in the models. Significance of gender
differences in the over- and underreporting of disability is
determined by the significance of the interaction between
gender, disability, and performance.
Logistic regression is used to evaluate the association
between performance and reported function in a different
manner. A series of regression models are analyzed for each
of the three summarized self-reported function outcomes
(ADL, gross mobility limitation, and ROM limitation). The
initial model determines the unadjusted gender differential
in function. The second model assesses the effect of overall
performance (physical performance score) on the gender
differential. In these analyses, observed performance serves
as a proxy for actual, overall disability. Any remaining
gender difference is interpreted as an inaccurate perception
of true functional problems and may be explained by other
factors.
Analyses are conducted using the Survey Data Analyses
(SUDAAN) software, which can account for the New Haven
EPESE sampling design (multiple housing strata, oversam-
pling of men). Results reflect weighted data, though actual
numbers (ns) of subjects are presented.
RESULTS
Distributions of individual and summary ADL disability
and functional limitations are presented in Table 1. Women
report more disability and functional limitations than men;
gender differences are significant for all function items. The
gender differentials are smallest for ADL disability and
largest for summarized ROM limitation. Gender differences
for summary measures of ADL disability, gross mobility
limitation, and ROM limitation are, respectively, 12%,
18%, and 23%.
Table 2 presents the distribution of performance measures
among men and women. Women perform more poorly than
men for every measure. Significant gender differences are
seen for the semi-tandem stand, full tandem stand, single
rise from a chair, 8-foot walk, and shoulder rotation. Signi-
ficantly more women than men had poor scores for all
summary measures.
Comparison between reported ability to walk across a
room and actual ability to walk 8 feet and back is presented
in Table 3. Specificity is quite high (.91 for men and .92 for
women), indicating that reported ability to walk across a
room is accurate. Sensitivity is fairly high for both men and
women (.71 and .82, respectively), indicating reported in-
ability to walk across a room is a good indicator of actual
inability to walk a short distance. False negatives were fairly

low; 29% of men and 18% of women reported ability but
were unable to walk 8 feet. This 11% gender difference is
marginally significant (p < .07), but is in the predicted
direction for the hypothesized greater underreporting of
disability among men.
The top portion of Table 4 presents the comparison be-
tween reported difficulty to stoop, crouch, or kneel and
ability to rise 5 consecutive times from a chair. Sensitivity
and specificity are moderately high for both men and
women, indicating fairly accurate reporting. However,
among those who reported inaccurately, women have a
higher proportion of false positives (16% difference) and
men have a greater proportion of false negatives (5% differ-
ence). These gender differences are highly significant (p <
.001) and are in the predicted direction for the hypothesized
female overreporting and male underreporting of disability.
Because reported difficulty represents degree of difficulty
rather than inability to stoop, crouch, or kneel, a second
comparison was made between reported difficulty in stoop-
ing and slow or quick times to rise from a chair; timing
represents a graded measurement which is more comparable
to graded degree of difficulty (Table 4, bottom half). Spe-
cificity is high, but sensitivity is very low. The gender
differences in false positive and negative proportions (11%
and 17%, respectively) are quite significant (p < .0001).
More women than men report difficulty but perform the task
quickly; more men than women report no difficulty but
perform the task slowly.
The top half of Table 5 presents the comparison between
difficulty reaching or extending arms above the head and
ability to rotate shoulders. Sensitivity is fairly high for men
and women (.67 and .74, respectively), and specificity quite
high (.92 and .86, respectively), indicating accurate report-
ing. The gender differences for false positive and false
negative proportions are significant atp < .03. Six percent
more women than men underreported and 4% more men than
women overreported ability to extend their arms above their
shoulders. Comparison of those reporting difficulty extend-
ing arms with partial or complete ability to rotate shoulders
is presented in the bottom half of Table 5. Again, since
reported difficulty is a graded measure, partial and complete
ability to rotate a shoulder allows comparison with a graded
measure. For this comparison, sensitivity is very low and
specificity is very high. False positive proportions for men
and women were similar (.07 and .10, respectively). A 14%
gender differential in false negatives (.85 vs .71) for those
who report no difficulty but are only partially able to rotate a
shoulder is significant (p < .02).
For each of the comparisons, overreporting of disability is
more common than underreporting, and both men and
women over- and underreport their ability; however, more
women than men underreport ability and more men than
women overreport ability. These differences in reporting
may explain all or some of the reported differences in self-
reports of functional disability. A direct test of the effect of
inaccurate reporting on the gender difference in reported
function is not available. We can, however, assess the effect
on the gender difference in reported disability by adjusting
for performance in logistic regression models. In these
regression models, the performance summary score is used
as a proxy for "true" dysfunction.
Table 6 presents the influence of physical performance on
the gender differential for summary ADL disability and
functional limitations. For ADL disability, the unadjusted
odds ratio for gender is 1.80. Adjusting for performance
summary score not only reduces the odds ratio to non-
significance, but reverses the direction of the effect. This
suggests that women's greater reported ADL disability is
real. For gross mobility limitation, the unadjusted gender
effect is 1.95 (95% confidence limit = 1.66-2.27). Adding
performance to the model reduces the gender effect to 1.16,
statistically nonsignificant at a < .05. This suggests that
women's greater reports of gross mobility limitation reflect
an actual female excess in this type of functional limitation.
Further adjusting for age reduces the gender effect only
slightly. For ROM limitation, the unadjusted gender odds
ratio is 2.57. Adjusting for performance reduces the gender
effect to 2.21 (95% confidence limit = 1.71-2.54), indica-
ting that inability to perform tasks explains some of the
reported difference. When the model is further adjusted for
age, the odds ratio for gender decreases to 1.72.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to examine gender differ-
ences in the reporting of functional problems. We evaluated
the accuracy of reported functional status for women and

men by comparing self-reported function with performance
measures. For all measures of ADL disability and functional
limitations, significantly more women than men reported
functional problems. For all seven performance measures,
women performed more poorly than did men. This in itself
suggests that women are truly more disabled than men, if
performance measures are assumed to reflect true ability. In
other words, women's poorer performance of tasks may be
attributed to their greater problems in functioning.
To assess differences in the reporting of disability, we
compared performance of three tasks to comparable self-
reported items. In these data, while most self-reports of
functional problems are quite accurate when compared to
performance (defined as the standard), there are genuine
gender differences among those who inaccurately reported
their functional status. Among the discrepancies, both men
and women over- and underreported functional problems.
However, more women overreported and more men under-
reported these problems.
There are several possible explanations for these differ-
ences. Women may have a greater symptom sensitivity and
readiness to perceive physical sensations as symptoms of

illness or disability (3,23). Typically, females are socialized
to pay attention to and acknowledge pain and discomfort,
while males are socialized to ignore physical discomfort (2).
While the literature cited primarily focuses on symptoms and
illness rather than disability, it is likely that the same mecha-
nisms apply to disability since pain, discomfort, and weak-
ness are all associated with disability. Thus, women may be
more willing to report and talk about their symptoms or
dysfunction, whereas men may be more hesitant to admit
physical limitations.
Perceptual differences may exist for response categories,
particularly ordinal responses, such as the degree of dif-
ficulty scaling common to the range-of-motion limitation
items. One person's definition of "a little'' difficulty may be
another's definition of "some difficulty," and this percep-
tual discrepancy may contribute to observed gender differ-
ences in reported function.
Over- and underreports of disability are based on perfor-
mance being defined as the standard for comparison pur-
poses; however, performance measures may not truly repre-

sent the ' 'gold standard.'' Performance items may not reflect
usual daily activities, or study subjects may try harder to
perform tasks than they would in normal daily life. Cogni-
tively impaired subjects may not understand the task they are
asked to perform. The chance of misunderstanding is greatly
reduced, however, since the interviewer demonstrates each
task before asking the study subject to attempt it. Guralnik et
al. (16) have suggested that use of performance measures
offers a supplemental approach to obtaining valid data on
physical functioning in cognitively impaired persons. Sev-
eral studies indicatethe high correlation between self-reports
and performance measures (e.g., 16,24); thus, while perfor-
mance measures may not truly be the "gold standard," they
provide a good means for comparison with reported ability.
We were unable to directly test the effect of inaccurate
reporting on the gender effect for all disability measures as
appropriate comparisons were available for only three func-
tional measures. However, the effect of overall performance
(a proxy for true disability) on the gender differences in
function was assessed. Overall performance accounted for
all the gender difference in ADL disability and gross mobil-
ity limitation, and some of the difference in ROM limitation,
again suggesting that functional problems women report
reflect real functional deficits. The remaining gender differ-
ence in ROM limitation is likely due to differences in the
perception of ability among men and women, detailed previ-
ously. In these data, while most self-reports of functional
problems are quite accurate when compared to performance,
there are genuine gender differences among those who
inaccurately reported their functional status.
A limitation of these analyses must be recognized. Not all
the performance measures assessed are the same activities

queried in functional status items. Few performance mea-
sures, and fewer items that are comparable to ADL disability
and functional limitation items, do not allow complete ex-
amination of gender differences in the reporting of func-
tional status. Ideally, multiple and varied performed tasks
should replicate self-reported function items so that an in-
creased number of comparisons can be examined and so that
self-reports and performance measures will be more compa-
rable. Despite the limitation, this is the first study, to our
knowledge, that has made such comparisons to provide
another way of examining the gender differences in func-
tion. While there are significant gender differences in the
way function is reported, these results suggest that men and
women are generally accurate in their reported disability and
that women's higher prevalence of reported functional prob-
lems is probably a reflection of true disability.
