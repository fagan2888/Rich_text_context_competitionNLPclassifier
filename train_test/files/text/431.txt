OBJECTIVE -- Although lower-extremity disease (LED), which includes lower-extremity
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and peripheral neuropathy (PN), is disabling and costly, no
nationally representative estimates of its prevalence exist. The aim of this study was to examine
the prevalence of lower-extremity PAD, PN, and overall LED in the overall U.S. population and
among those with and without diagnosed diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The analysis consisted of data for 2,873 men
and women aged 40 years, including 419 with diagnosed diabetes, from the 1999­2000
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The main outcome measures consisted of
the prevalence of lower-extremity PAD (defined as ankle-brachial index 0.9), PN (defined as
1 insensate area based on monofilament testing), and of any LED (defined as either PAD, PN,
or history of foot ulcer or lower-extremity amputations).
RESULTS -- Of the U.S. population aged 40 years, 4.5% (95% CI 3.4­5.6) have lower-
extremity PAD, 14.8% (12.8­16.8) have PN, and 18.7% (15.9­21.4) have any LED. Prevalence
of PAD, PN, and overall LED increases steeply with age and is higher (P  0.05) in non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans than non-Hispanic whites. The prevalence of LEDs is approxi-
mately twice as high for individuals with diagnosed diabetes (PAD 9.5% [5.5­13.4]; PN 28.5%
[22.0­35.1]; any LED 30.2% [22.1­38.3]) as the overall population.
CONCLUSIONS -- LED is common in the U.S. and twice as high among individuals with
diagnosed diabetes. These conditions disproportionately affect the elderly, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans.

Lower-extremity disease (LED), in-
cluding lower-extremity peripheral
arterial disease (PAD) and peripheral
neuropathy (PN), is disabling and costly
(1­5). PAD, which can be accompanied
by intermittent claudication or rest pain,
may necessitate revascularization proce-
dures and seriously diminish health-
related quality of life. Even when
asymptomatic, PAD may decrease mobil-
ity and bone mineral density (1,2,4,6)
and is a strong predictor of subsequent
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortal-
ity (3,7,8). PN also erodes health-related
quality of life, and when it occurs in com-
bination with PAD, as is frequently the
case with diabetes, it can lead to foot ul-
cers and nontraumatic amputations (1,9).
Despite the array of complications of
LED, its epidemiology in the U.S. has not
been well characterized. Previous preva-
lence estimates for PAD from the U.S. and
Europe, for example, have ranged from
5­20% in general populations aged 50
years (10­18). The prevalence of PN de-
fined by symptoms or impaired vibration
sensation in populations with diabetes
has ranged from 10 to 42% (19­24). Part
of this variation is probably due to meth-
odological differences, including varia-
tions in definitions, populations, and
measurements. There have been no na-
tionally representative estimates of the
prevalence of PAD or PN in the overall
U.S. population or those with diabetes. In
addition, previous studies have not exam-
ined the combined burden of PAD and PN
or the degree to which these conditions
are specific to individuals with diabetes.
Because of the lack of population-
based data on LEDs in the U.S. and the
potential to reduce its burden through
pharmacological or behavioral interven-
tions (1,4,25­28), new measurements of
these conditions were incorporated in the
1999­2000 National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES). The
objectives of the present study were to
determine the prevalence of LED, includ-
ing lower-extremity PAD and PN in the
U.S. among both the overall population
and individuals with diagnosed diabetes.

Control and Prevention (29). Since 1999,
NHANES staff have conducted interviews
and performed physical examinations on
a continuous basis. Participants are inter-
viewed in their homes to obtain informa-
tion on health history, health behaviors,
and risk factors. Participants subse-
quently undergo the physical examina-
tion at a mobile examination center. The
procedures to select the sample and con-
duct the interview and examination have
been specified elsewhere (30). Informed
consent was obtained from all partici-
pants, and the institutional review board
of the National Center for Health Statistics
approved the protocol.
This study was based on the initial 2
years of the continuous NHANES (1999­
2000). Among the 4,274 individuals aged
40 years who were eligible for the sur-
vey, 3,185 (74%) were interviewed and
2,875 (67%) received the health examina-
tion. All participants aged 40 years who
received the physical examination (n 
2,875) were invited to undergo assess-
ment of LEDs, which included noninva-
sive tests for PAD and PN, as well as
physical inspection for foot lesions and
abnormalities. Two individuals were ex-
cluded from the entire examination be-
cause they had bilateral amputations (n 
2). Individuals with ankle-brachial index
(ABI) 1.5 in both legs (n  2) or in one
leg (n  4) if the ABI value for the other
leg was missing were excluded, as these
individuals were believed to have medial
arterial calcification, which prevents ac-
curate measurement of arterial perfusion.
Data on PAD were missing on both feet for
492 individuals (17%) and data on PN
were missing for 346 individuals (12%),
owing to either equipment or data capture
failure, limited time available to conduct
the examination, participant refusal, or
some other unspecified reason. An in-
compressible artery, absent pulse, or
some other condition related to the dis-
ease may have also led to missing data,
but this information was unavailable for
analysis. Thus, complete information on
PAD, PN, and all LED data were available
on 2,375, 2,527, and 2,300 individuals,
respectively, aged 40 years.
Assessment of PAD
PAD was assessed by determining the
ABI, which is the ratio of systolic blood
pressure in the ankles (posterior tibial
vessels) to that in the right arm (right bra-
chial vessel). Measurements were taken
with the participant in the supine position
using an 8.1-MHz Doppler probe at-
tached to a vascular testing device (Parks
Mini-Lab IV, model 3100). Trained tech-
nicians followed a standard protocol (31).
For participants aged 40­59 years, two
blood pressure measurements were taken
at each site (right arm, both ankles), and
left and right ABI were calculated as the
mean of the two measurements at the
right and left ankle, respectively, divided
by the mean of the two brachial blood
pressure measurements. For logistic rea-
sons, participants aged 60 years (n 
1,605) received only one measurement at
each site, and thus, a single measurement
was used to calculate the right and left
ABIs.
Our primary analyses defined PAD as
an ABI 0.9 in either leg. The 0.9 cut
point has been shown to have a high sen-
sitivity and specificity in angiographic
studies (4,32). We also examined the
prevalence ABI 0.7, which has been de-
fined as moderate-to-severe PAD. PAD
cases were classified as symptomatic if the
participant reported "yes" when asked
during the home interview (before exam-
ination) whether they ever get calf pain in
either leg while walking.
Assessment of PN
PN was assessed using self-reported
symptoms and by testing of foot sensation
with a standard monofilament (5.07-
gauge Semmes-Weinstein nylon) accord-
ing to a standard protocol (31). Health
technicians applied pressure with the
monofilament at three sites (plantar, first
metatarsal head; plantar, fifth metatarsal
head; and plantar, hallux) on the bottom
of each foot (i.e., a total of six sites). The
monofilament was applied until it buck-
led, then held for 1 s. A site was consid-
ered insensate if the participant
incorrectly determined when the mono-
filament was applied to the foot on two of
three applications. Impaired sensation
was quantified by the total number of in-
sensate areas for both feet (range 0­6),
and PN was defined as 1 insensate area.
Previous studies have found 1 insensate
area to be highly predictive of ulcers and
amputation and to have moderately high
sensitivity (85%) and specificity
(80%) based on vibration testing and
ulcer history and prevalence (1,33­35).
Participants were also asked during the
interview whether in the last 3 months
they had had numbness, loss of feeling, or
painful sensations or tingling in their feet.
PN cases were classified as symptomatic if
theparticipantreportedyestothisquestion.
Other assessments of LED
Participants were also asked whether they
ever had an ulcer or sore on their leg or
foot that took 4 weeks to heal. During
the examination, health technicians also
recorded the history of lower-extremity
amputation. Ten individuals with a toe or
foot amputation were identified. We de-
fined any LED as a presence of either PAD
(ABI 0.9), PN (1 insensate areas), foot
ulcers, or lower-extremity amputation.
We defined symptomatic LED as having
either PAD or PN symptoms.
Diabetes and other measurements
A history of physician-diagnosed diabe-
tes, hypertension, stroke, and CVD (con-
gestive heart failure, coronary heart
disease, angina, heart attack) as well as
age, race/ethnicity, and smoking was as-
sessed by questionnaire (30). Because of
the limited sample, only estimates for non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans are reported, al-
though data for other race/ethnicity
groups are included in total estimates. In-
dividuals were classified as never, former,
and current smokers based on their re-
sponses to questions about smoking at
least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime
and whether they were currently smok-
ing. Additionally, height and weight were
measured with a standard protocol and
used to compute BMI (kg/m2).
Statistical analyses
Our primary analyses estimated the prev-
alence of the diseases of interest in the
overall population and within several
subgroups. All analyses were conducted
using SUDAAN software to take into ac-
count the complex sampling design and
to obtain estimates representative of the
noninstitutionalized U.S. population
aged 40 years (36). For each of the pri-
mary outcomes, we used the largest sam-
ple number available to estimate
prevalence. For PAD and PN, this was
2,375 and 2,527 individuals, respec-
tively. For any LED, we used the number
of individuals who had all variables (PAD,
PN, amputations, ulcers) present (n 
2,300). Variance estimates were calcu-
lated using the "delete one" jackknife
method (37). The 95% CIs were com-
puted using the critical value for a t dis-

tribution with the appropriate number of
degrees of freedom for each subgroup
(SDJ1REPN-1). Age-adjusted prevalence
estimates were calculated using the direct
method, which were age adjusted to the
2000 projected U.S. population using
three age-groups: 40­59, 60­74, and
75 years (38). Estimates with a relative
standard error 30% were considered
statistically unreliable and are identified
as such in tables. Statistical hypotheses
were tested univariately at the 0.05 level
using a t-statistic.
Because there were missing data for
17% of the PAD and 12% of the PN sam-
ples, we examined the characteristics of
individuals with missing data. Compared
with individuals with sufficient PAD data,
those individuals with missing PAD data
were significantly more likely to be 60
years (49 vs. 37%; P  0.01), female (61
vs. 52%; P  0.01), non-Hispanic black
(14 vs. 9%; P  0.01), and diabetic (18 vs.
9%; P  0.001) but did not significantly
differ with regard to CVD or current
smoking status. Individuals with missing
PN data did not significantly differ from
those with PN data in terms of age, sex,
diabetes, CVD, or current smoking status
but were more likely to be non-Hispanic
black (17%) than individuals with PN
data (9%) (P  0.001).
Because of these differences, we fur-
ther examined the potential impact of
nonresponse by adjusting the original
sampling weights according to methods
published by Lohr (39). Examination of
findings using these adjusted weights led
to only minor differences in point and
variance estimates (0.1­0.8%); thus, in
this study, we present all estimates using
the original 2-year examination weights.
RESULTS -- The general characteris-
tics of the study population, weighted to
be representative of the U.S. population
40 years of age, are shown in Table 1.
The mean age of this segment of the pop-
ulation was estimated to be 57 years, with
9.6% non-Hispanic black and 4.5% Mex-
ican American. In addition, by self-report,
9.9% had diabetes, 36.0% had hyperten-
sion, and 11.5% had CVD. Compared
with the overall population, the diabetic
population was older (mean age 62
years), consisted of more nonwhites, had
higher BMI values, fewer smokers, and a
higher prevalence of hypertension, CVD,
and stroke.
Among U.S. adults aged 40 years,
an estimated 4.5% had PAD (ABI 0.9)
(Fig. 1), among whom almost two-thirds
were asymptomatic (i.e., no calf pain with
walking) and almost one-third (1.3%
[95% CI 0.7­1.8]) had ABI 0.7 (data
not shown). Prevalence of PN (1 insen-
sate area) was 14.8%, among whom over
three-fourths were asymptomatic. Almost
one-half of those with PN had two or
more insensate areas (6.8% [5.3­8.2]),
and over one-fourth had three or more
such areas (3.8% [2.8­4.9]) (data not
shown). Overall, 18.7% of the U.S. pop-
ulation aged 40 years had at least one
LED condition (including PAD, PN, or a
history of ulcer or amputation), among
whom 71% were asymptomatic.
The prevalence of PAD (9.5%), PN
(28.5%), and any LED (30.2%) was ap-
proximately twice as high among individ-
uals with diagnosed diabetes as in the
overall population, whereas prevalence of
ulcers (7.7%) was almost three times as
high. Like the overall population, most
cases of PAD (78%), PN (62%), and any
LED (56%) were asymptomatic among
individuals with diagnosed diabetes.
Prevalence by demographic factors
The prevalence of PAD, PN, and of any
LED all increased steeply with age (Table
2). For example, although the prevalence
of PAD was only 1% among individuals
aged 40­49 years, it roughly doubled

each decade, reaching 12% in those aged
70­79 years and 22% among individuals
aged 80 years. The prevalence of PN
rose from 8.1% in the 40- to 49-year age-
group to 34.7% in the 80-years age-
group. From age 50 years, the prevalence
of any LED increased by roughly 10 per-
centage points each decade.
The age-adjusted prevalence of PAD
did not significantly differ by sex, but men
had a higher prevalence of PN (18.2%)
and any LED (22.9%) than women (PN
12.6%; any LED 16.8%; P  0.05 for
each). The age-adjusted prevalence of
PAD was higher among non-Hispanic
blacks (9.6%; P  0.05) and Mexican
Americans (6.8%; P  0.05) than among
non-Hispanic whites (4.8%) (Table 2).
Similarly, the age-adjusted prevalence of
PN was higher among non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans than
among non-Hispanic whites. Prevalence
of any LED was also lowest among non-
Hispanic whites (19.0%), intermediate
among Mexican Americans (23.9%; P 
0.05), and highest among non-Hispanic
blacks (29.8%; P  0.05). Differences in
neuropathy and any LED between race/
ethnicity tended to be greater among
women than among men.
The age-adjusted prevalence of PAD
did not differ appreciably between indi-
viduals with PN (6.3% [95% CI 3.0­9.6])
and those without PN (5.0% [3.8­6.2])
(data not shown). The prevalence of PN
tended to be higher among those with
PAD (23.1% [6.6­39.6]) than those with-
out PAD (14.2% [12.1­16.4]), although
this difference was not statistically signif-
icant (data not shown).
CONCLUSIONS -- Despite the ex-
tensive toll that LED takes in terms of
physical disability, amputation, mortality
risk, and economic costs, no previous na-
tional prevalence estimates for either the
general or diabetic population exist (1­9).
We used data from the 1999 ­2000
NHANES, which was the first national
study to use ABI and monofilament test-
ing. We estimate that among the U.S.
noninstitutionalized population aged
40 years, roughly 5% have lower-
extremity PAD, 15% have PN, and 19%
have at least one LED condition. The
prevalence of these conditions is roughly
twice as high among individuals with di-
agnosed diabetes, as 10% have lower-
extremity PAD, 29% have PN, and 30%
have at least one LED condition. Consis-
tent with previous studies, we found that
most cases of PAD and PN are asymptom-
atic (2,3,10).
Much of the burden of both lower-
extremity PAD and PN may be prevent-
able or more effectively managed. PAD is
thought to share a common atheroscle-
rotic etiology with coronary heart disease
and stroke (3,7,12,13). The efficacy of in-
terventions to prevent PAD is not known,
but surgical interventions, exercise train-
ing, smoking cessation, aspirin, and anti-
platelet and lipid-lowering drugs may
each be effective in managing the condi-
tion (3,4,25,26). The presence of PAD
may also be an indication for broad man-
agement of CVD risk factors because of its
association with stroke, myocardial in-
farction, and cardiovascular mortality
(7,8), but studies suggest that patients
with PAD are less aggressively managed
than those with coronary artery disease
(40).
Among people with diabetes, the pro-
gression of PN can be slowed by intensive
glycemic control (27,28), and early detec-
tion and aggressive care of ulcers may re-
duce risk of amputation (9,41). Regular
foot examinations are considered essen-
tial for individuals with diabetes, whereas
the detection and management of high-
risk feet among individuals without dia-
betes has received much less attention.
Given the range of potential modifiable
risk factors for LED, these national esti-
mates provide a key baseline from which

to examine the impact of future preven-
tion efforts for this disease.
Few previous studies have examined
the relationship between race/ethnicity
and LED. We found that non-Hispanic
blacks had the highest prevalence of PAD
and PN, and Mexican Americans had lev-
els that were higher than whites but lower
than blacks. In the Cardiovascular Health
Study, nonwhite race was associated with
twice the odds of PAD (12). Similarly, the
San Antonio Heart Study reported 61%
greater odds of PAD among Mexican
Americans than among non-Hispanic
whites, but these findings were not signif-
icant (42). In a previous national sample
of individuals with diabetes, both blacks
and Mexican Americans had a higher
prevalence of neuropathy symptoms than
whites but only among those with diabe-
tes for 15 years (23).
Our PAD estimates are lower than
those of most previous reports. For exam-
ple, previous estimates using 60- to 70-
year-olds have ranged from 3 to 12%
(11­13,18), as compared with 5% for
this age-group in our study. Estimates
similar to or lower than those in our study
were observed for white women in the
Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (18),
women without CVD in the Cardiovascu-
lar Health Study (12), and men in the Ho-
nolulu Heart Study (3­5% among those
aged 65­69 years and 6­8% among
those aged 70­74 years) (15). Samples
from the Netherlands, Scotland, and men
in the Cardiovascular Health Study all
had prevalence estimates ranging from 8
to 12% for individuals of similar age as
compared with 4.5% in our study (11­
13). Previous estimates among diabetic
populations have been considerably
higher among European studies (11,13)
and in the Honolulu Heart Study (15)
but comparable in India and Australia
(17,43).
The lower prevalence we observed
could be due to several factors. Although
previous studies sampled individuals
from population-based sources, there
may have been varying levels of represen-
tativeness of the underlying population. It
is possible that previous studies have se-
lectively recruited individuals of worse
health status, or alternatively, that the de-
mands of the NHANES examination leads
to a slightly healthier sample. It is also
possible that there was a higher rate of
missing data, and unmeasureable ABI val-
ues in our sample led to an underestimat-
ing prevalence. Finally, this could reflect a
reduction in PAD incidence or CVD risk
factors over the past decade, as most pre-
vious studies were not conducted re-
cently. This would be consistent with the
observed reductions in CVD risk factors
and mortality in the U.S. (44), but no lon-
gitudinal data exist to support or refute
this speculation. Unfortunately, the lack
of consistency in methods of recruiting,
conducting, and reporting studies of
LED makes it difficult to identify the
key reasons explaining discrepancies in
prevalence.
Because of the wide variation in defi-
nitions, it is also difficult to compare PN
prevalence estimates between popula-
tions and over time. In the San Luis Valley

Diabetes Study, prevalence based on vi-
bration threshold testing was 28% in the
diabetic population and 4% in those with-
out diabetes (45). Similarly, a hospital-
based population in the U.K. had a
prevalence of 29% (22), whereas a recent
population-based study in Australia
found a prevalence of 10% among indi-
viduals with diabetes (17). In a recent
study in Northwest England that used
methods similar to our study, prevalence
of insensate feet among individuals with
known diabetes was 21% (35). Other
studies have defined PN based on vibra-
tion threshold, temperature perception,
and ankle reflexes, finding that preva-
lence ranged from 42 to 47% (24,46). In
the 1989 National Health Interview Sur-
vey, 38% of the diabetic population and
11% of those without diabetes had symp-
toms of sensory neuropathy, which was
defined as numbness, loss of feeling, pain,
or tingling in the last 3 months. Our study
is the first nationally representative study
in the U.S. to examine PN based on an ob-
jective measure of sensation (monofila-
ment testing) and, thus, should serve as an
important baseline for surveillance of PN.
There are several potential limitations
to our study. First, NHANES does not in-
clude individuals from nursing homes
and other similar institutions. Thus, our
estimates probably underestimate those
of the total U.S. population. Second,
within the NHANES sample, ABI mea-
surements were not available for 17% of
the sample, many of whom may have had
disease. Adjustment procedures were
used to decrease the potential nonre-
sponse bias, but not all factors can be ac-
counted for, and thus, it is more likely
that we have underestimated than overes-
timated the true disease prevalence.
Third, our prevalence definitions are
based on noninvasive indicators of dis-
ease. The ABI has emerged as a measure-
ment of choice for PAD because it is a
noninvasive and inexpensive yet a more
sensitive (95%) and specific (99%)
indicator of arterial obstruction (33,34)
than previously used measures, such as
intermittent claudication or pulse inspec-
tion. For PN, electrophysiological and
nerve conduction studies could give more
accurate diagnostic data, but for epidemi-
ological settings, monofiliament testing is
still an improvement over the previously
used symptom questionnaires in terms of
sensitivity, specificity, and prediction of
adverse outcomes (1,33,34). With regard
to both PAD and PN, however, it is im-
portant to note that the choice of disease
cut points are based on clinic-based,
symptomatic samples of individuals for
ABI (4,10) and diabetic individuals for
monofilament testing (1,1,34). Thus, val-
idation studies are still needed among
broader population samples to further re-
fine the use of these measures for epide-
miological surveillance purposes. Finally,
we lacked detailed information on symp-
toms and lacked power to examine prev-
alence estimates within subgroups,
including individuals with undiagnosed
diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance,
as well as age, sex, or ethnicity subgroups
among individuals with diabetes.
This study provides the first national
estimates in the U.S. of the civilian, non-
institutionalized population and, thus,
the most broadly representative estimates
to date for the U.S. population. Because
much of this burden may be preventable
through existing interventions, these data
should provide policy makers, clinicians,
and researchers with key data for preven-
tion and treatment efforts. This study also
provides baseline data to monitor the
prevalence of LED, its consequences, and
the success of prevention efforts.
