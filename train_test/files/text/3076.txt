Ethnic and Socioeconomic Differences
in Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors
Findings for Women From the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994

Context.--Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are higher among ethnic
minority women than among white women in the United States. However, because
ethnic minority women are disproportionately poor, socioeconomic status (SES)
may substantially explain these risk factor differences.
Objective.--To determine whether differences in CVD risk factors by ethnicity
could be attributed to differences in SES.
Design.--Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted
between 1988 and 1994.
Setting.--Eighty-nine mobile examination centers.
Participants.--A total of 1762 black, 1481 Mexican American, and 2023 white
women, aged 25 to 64 years, who completed both the home questionnaire and
medical examination.
Main Outcome Measures.--Ethnicity and years of education (SES) in relation
to systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI, a measure of
weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), physical inactivity,
non­high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non­HDL-C [the difference between total
cholesterol and HDL-C]), and non­insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Results.--As expected, most CVD risk factors were higher among ethnic
minority women than among white women. After adjusting for years of education,
highly significant differences in blood pressure, BMI, physical inactivity, and diabe-
tes remained for both black and Mexican American women compared with white
women(P.001). In addition, women of lower SESfrom eachof the3ethnicgroups
had significantly higher prevalences of smoking and physical inactivity and higher
levels of BMI and non­HDL-C than women of higher SES (P.001).
Conclusions.--These findings provide the greatest evidence to date of higher
CVD risk factors among black and Mexican American women than among white
women of comparable SES. The striking differences by both ethnicity and SES un-
derscore the critical need to improve screening, early detection, and treatment of
CVD-related conditions for black and Mexican American women, as well as for
women of lower SES in all ethnic groups.

CARDIOVASCULAR disease (CVD)
istheleadingcauseofdeathamongwom-
en in the United States, accounting for a
half-million deaths and 2.5 million hospi-
talizations annually.1,2 These deaths are
linked with the primary CVD risk fac-
tors: elevated blood pressure, cigarette
smoking, hypercholesterolemia, excess
body weight, sedentary lifestyle, and
diabetes, all of which are substantially
influencedbybehavioral,social,cultural,
and economic factors.3-8
Ethnic minority women exhibit CVD
risk factors to a greater extent than do
white women. Many studies have docu-
mentedgreaterprevalencesofhighblood
pressure, physical inactivity, excess
weight, and diabetes in African Ameri-
can women than in white women.9-15
Fewer studies have examined CVD risk
factors among Hispanic Americans, who
constitute 11% of the population in the
United States. As one of the fastest-
growingethnicminoritygroups,theHis-
panic share of the population is pro-
jected to increase to 96.5 million people,
or24%ofthepopulation,by2050.16-18 His-
panic Americans are a heterogeneous
group, with Mexican Americans consti-
tuting 64% of its population.19 Studies,
with some inconsistencies, have shown
higherprevalencesofexcessweight,dia-
betes, and untreated hypertension in
Mexican American women than in white
women.13,20-26 Studieshavealsoshownthat
incidence27 and mortality rates of CVD
are higher for ethnic minority women
than for white women.28,29
Some ethnic variations in CVD risk
factorsmaybegeneticallybased.30 How-
ever, because ethnic minority women
are more likely to be poor, have less edu-
cation, and have less access to health re-
sources than white women,31 socioeco-
nomic status (SES) may explain many of
the differences. Numerous empirical
studies in the United States have shown
strongassociationsamongCVDriskfac-
torsandabroadarrayofSESindicators,
including education, income, and occu-
pational status.32-36 Additional studies in
the United States and abroad have
shown that rates of coronary heart dis-
ease and stroke morbidity and mortality
are strongly associated with SES.37-42
Despite the convincing body of litera-
ture that links SES to CVD, most stud-
ies of ethnic differences in CVD have not
taken SES into account. Therefore, er-
roneousfindingscanresult,overestimat-
ing the effects of ethnicity without con-
sidering the effects of SES.43,44 Although
distinguishing the interrelated effects of
ethnicity and SES on health indicators
has been strongly advocated,45,46 a re-
cent review of CVD studies published

years identified only 13 studies that in-
cluded both ethnicity and SES in their
analyses.47 All of these studies were lim-
ited in scope; each included only 1 ethnic
comparison, examined only 1 CVD risk
factor, and/or was restricted to 1 geo-
graphic area.
WehypothesizedthatblackandMexi-
can American women would exhibit
CVD risk factors to a greater extent
than white women but that the differ-
ences would be explained substantially
by SES. To test this hypothesis, we
evaluatedtheindependentrelationships
of ethnicity and SES with 6 primary
CVD risk factors: systolic blood pres-
sure, cigarette smoking, body mass in-
dex (BMI), physical inactivity, non­
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(non­HDL-C), and non­insulin-depen-
dent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, chosen
because of its relationship to lifestyle
factors and its disproportionately high
rates in ethnic minority groups).12 We
present data on 5266 black, Mexican
American, and white women from the
Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III).
Wealsoaddressed2importantmeasure-
ment and analytic issues that contribute
to understanding ethnic differences in
CVD. First, we examined whether 2 in-
dicators of SES, educational attainment
(an individual-level marker of SES) and
poverty-income ratio (a family-level
marker), produced similar findings. Sec-
ond, we examined whether 2 analytic
procedures, a multivariate linear model
and a matched-pairs analysis, produced
similar findings.
METHODS
NHANES III, conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics, Hy-
attsville, Md, assessed the health and nu-
tritionofthecivilian,noninstitutionalized
population of the United States.
NHANES III used the same stratified,
multistage probability design used by
previous NHANE surveys.48-50 It was
conducted in two 3-year phases. Phase I
was conducted from 1988 to 1991 and
phase II from 1991 to 1994. It included a
total sample of 33 994 persons aged 2
monthsorolder.Bydesign,NHANESIII
oversampled the black and Mexican
Americanpopulationstoproducereliable
health estimates for the 2 largest ethnic
minority groups in the United States.
NHANESIIIstaffconductedsurveys
in households, administering question-
naires to families, adults, and children.
Standardized medical examinations fol-
lowed, conducted in NHANES III mo-
bile examination centers. The household
surveys included demographic, socioeco-
nomic, dietary, and health history ques-
tions; the medical examinations included
measurements of blood pressure, lipid
levels, and glucose levels.
The sample for our analyses included
black, Mexican American, and white
women aged 25 to 64 years who com-
pleted both the home questionnaire and
medical examination. We used the lower
age cut point of 25 years to ensure that
most individuals had completed their
highest level of education (our primary
indicator of SES) and the upper age cut
point of 64 years to avoid problems of se-
lection effects due to non­CVD-caused
morbidity and mortality.51 We excluded
data for women who were pregnant
(n = 168), women from other ethnic
groups (n = 262), women whose surveys
were coded as unreliable (n = 8), and
women who completed the home ques-
tionnaire but not the medical examina-
tion (n = 402). The 402 women who com-
pleted only the home questionnaire were
similartothe5266womenwhocompleted
boththehomequestionnaireandmedical
examination in age (43.6 vs 42.2 mean
years, respectively), years of education
(11.9 vs 11.3 mean years, respectively),
and country of birth (86% vs 84% born in
the United States, respectively).
Definition of Variables
Respondents to NHANES III were
asked to classify their race or ethnicity
as black; Mexican or Mexican American;
white; Asian or Pacific Islander; Aleut,
Eskimo, or American Indian; or other
Latin American or other Spanish. Wom-
en who chose 1 of the first 3 categories
were included in our analyses.
The NHANES III data included sev-
eral individual-level and family-level in-
dicatorsofSES.Weusededucationalat-
tainment as our primary indicator of
SES because education level, unlike in-
come level and occupation, is available
regardlessofemploymentstatus,amore
constant measure of lifelong SES, and
not affected by the CVD outcomes we
analyzed.52,53 Women were asked to give
thehighestgradeoryearofregularpub-
lic or private school that they had com-
pleted. Poverty-income ratio, our sec-
ondary indicator of SES, is calculated
fromfamilyincomeandfamilysizeandis
based on US Bureau of the Census
tables. Years of education and poverty-
income ratio were moderately corre-
lated (r = 0.47, P.001), a finding consis-
tent with previous research.53
We used the following 6 CVD risk fac-
tors as outcome variables: (1) Systolic
bloodpressure,measuredinmillimeters
of mercury. We report the mean of the
secondandthirdof3readings,measured
on the right arm by a physician while the
participant was seated during the medi-
cal examination. (2) Current cigarette
smoking status. Participants reported
whether they had smoked at least 100
cigarettes during their lifetimes and
whether they were currently smoking
cigarettes. We used serum cotinine lev-
els (74 nmol/L [13 ng/mL])54 avail-
able in phase I participants to validate
self-reported smoking status. (3) Body
mass index, a measure of weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of height in
meters. The calculations provide a mea-
sure of relative weight. (4) Leisure-time
activity. Questions on leisure-time
physical activity were adapted from the
1985 National Health Interview Sur-
vey,50 which asked participants whether
they had engaged in any leisure-time
physical activity in the past month, in-
cluding exercises, sports, or physically
active hobbies. Women who reported no
leisure-time activities were considered
physically inactive. (5) Non­high-den-
sitylipoproteincholesterol,measuredin
millimoles per liter (milligrams per de-
ciliter). Measurements were taken from
serumspecimens,analyzedbystandard-
ized protocols, and calculated as the dif-
ference between total cholesterol and
HDL-C.55 Non­high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, which may be a better indi-
catorofatherogeniclipoproteinparticles
than indirectly estimated low-density li-
poprotein cholesterol,55 does not require
fasting blood samples, and therefore, al-
lowed the use of the entire NHANES
III sample. (6) Non­insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus. Fasting plasma glu-
cose levels, available on the entire
NHANES III sample, were determined
using a microadaptation of the national
glucose oxidase reference method.56
Women were classified as having
NIDDM if they fasted for 8 or more
hours and had plasma glucose levels of
7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or more (cut
point based on the new diagnostic crite-
ria for epidemiological studies by the
American Diabetes Association)57 or if
they reported a medical history of dia-
betes (other than during pregnancy)
with an age of onset older than 25 years.
Data Analysis
We carried out our primary statistical
analyses, based on linear models, using
SUDAAN, Version 7.11 (Research Tri-
angleInstitute,ResearchTrianglePark,
NC), a software program that adjusts
for the complex NHANES III sample
design for calculating variance esti-
mates.58 All analyses incorporated sam-
pling weights that adjusted for unequal
probabilities of selection. We used
SUDAAN to calculate weighted means
and percentages and SEs, and we used
SAS statistical software, Version 6.12
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) to calcu-
lateweightedSDs.Weusedmultiplelin-
ear regression models for continuous

outcomes and logistic regression models
for binary outcomes. The outcome vari-
ables in our models were the 6 risk fac-
torsdescribedherein.Thepredictorvari-
ables were age (in years, centered at the
sample mean to aid in the interpretation
oftheregressioncoefficients),raceoreth-
nicity(blackandMexicanAmericanwom-
encomparedseparatelywithwhitewom-
en; each comparison used white women
asthereferencegroup),andyearsofedu-
cation (continuous and centered at 12
years). We included all first-order inter-
actions between predictor variables (age
and ethnicity, age and education, ethnic-
ity and education). Because of multiple
outcome variables, we selected a conser-
vative level of statistical significance
(P.01, 2-tailed). In a secondary analy-
sis, we substituted poverty-income ra-
tio (continuous, centered at the sample
mean) for years of education to examine
the extent to which this indicator of SES
might produce different results.
We used a matched-pairs analysis to
confirm findings from the linear models
because matching can overcome poten-
tial limitations such as unmet linear
model assumptions, problems of col-
linearity (eg, a strong correlation be-
tween ethnicityandSES),andexclusion
of higher-order interaction terms.59,60
For the matched-pairs analysis, we

can American woman with a different
white woman and matched the pairs on

years) and age (±2 years). To test for
overall differences in CVD risk factors
between the matched pairs, we used
paired t tests for continuous risk factor
variables and the McNemar test for bi-
nary variables.
RESULTS
The selected NHANES III sample in-
cluded 1762 black, 1481 Mexican Ameri-
can, and 2023 white women, aged 25 to 64
years, who completed both the home
questionnaire and the medical examina-
tion(Table1).Lesseducatedwomenwere
older,lesslikelytoliveinurbanareas(es-
pecially white women), and poorer than
women who were more highly educated.
MexicanAmericanwomenwereyounger,
had completed less education, and were
less likely to be born in the United States
and to speak English at home than black
or white women. There were adequate
numbers of women in 2 subgroups that
are commonly underrepresented in stud-
ies of ethnic differences in CVD: Mexican
American women with higher levels of
education (n = 236 with 12 years of edu-
cation) and white women with lower lev-
els of education (n = 120 with 9 years of
education).
The data did not confirm our hypoth-
esis that SES would substantially ex-
plain differences in CVD risk factors.
Clearly,bothethnicityandSEShaveim-
portant and independent associations
(P.001) with CVD risk factors (Table
2). Ethnic minority status was signifi-
cantly associated with BMI, systolic
blood pressure, NIDDM, and physical
inactivity.Socioeconomicstatuswassig-
nificantly associated with BMI, physical

inactivity, cigarette smoking, and high
non­HDL-C. As expected, age was sig-
nificantlyassociatedwithallriskfactors.
The magnitude of the ethnic and SES
differences was large for many compari-
sons. For example, the  coefficient was
2.8 for the black-white comparison for
BMI. Each BMI unit is equivalent to
about 2.7 kg (6.0 lb) for comparison of
persons with average heights. Thus, the
BMI  coefficient of 2.8 for black women
indicates that they were, on average, 7.6
kg (16.8 lb) heavier than white women of
comparable SES and age.
When poverty-income ratio was sub-
stituted for years of education in the lin-
ear models, results were almost identi-
cal; all risk factors that were signifi-
cantlyrelatedtoyearsofeducationwere
also significantly related to the poverty-
income ratio. In addition, NIDDM was
also significantly related to the poverty-
income ratio.
Table 3 presents descriptive statis-
tics,displayingmeanswithSDsandper-
centages. As confirmed by the linear
models (Table 2), black and Mexican
American women had significantly
higher levels of BMI and blood pressure
and higher prevalences of diabetes and
physical inactivity than did white wom-
en of comparable SES. The main excep-
tions were for smoking prevalences and
non­HDL-C levels; Mexican American
women had lower smoking prevalences
and black women had lower non­HDL-
C levels than did white women. Women
with lower SES from each of the 3 ethnic
groups had significantly higher levels of
BMI and non­HDL-C and higher preva-
lences of physical inactivity and smok-
ing than women with higher SES.
Two important and significant inter-
actionsemergedinthelinearmodels,be-
tween ethnicity and age for both blood
pressure and smoking (Figure). Black
and Mexican American women had
steeper increases in blood pressure than
white women across age groups, result-
ing in significantly greater ethnic differ-
ences for the older than younger age
groups (eg, the black-white difference of
4 mm Hg at age 25-34 years increased to
11 mm Hg at age 55-64 years). Black and
Mexican American women had stable
smoking rates across age groups, in con-
trast with white women, who showed a
sharp decrease in smoking rates, espe-
ciallybetweenthe2youngestagegroups
(eg, 41% of the white women aged 25-34
years smoked compared with 26% of the
white women aged 35-44 years).
Thematched-pairsanalysisconfirmed
the results from the linear models. Re-
sults were almost identical for all risk
factors,indicatingnobiasinapplyingthe
linear model to the full sample. The only
result not confirmed was for non­HDL-
C; the black-white comparison was sig-
nificant in the linear model but not sig-
nificant in the matched-pairs analysis.

COMMENT
To our knowledge, this article is one of
the first to document higher levels of
CVD risk factors among black and Mexi-
can American women than among white
women of comparable age and SES. We
hypothesized that ethnic minority status
would be associated with higher levels of
CVD risk factors, but that the associa-
tionswouldbeexplainedsubstantiallyby
SES. Our hypothesis was not confirmed.
AfteradjustmentforageandSES,highly
significant differences in BMI, blood
pressure, diabetes, and physical inactiv-
ity remained between white women and
both black and Mexican American wom-
en.Inaddition,wefoundlargedifferences

illustrates the high-risk status of both
ethnic minority women as well as white
women with low SES.
Only 1 previous study examined the
joint relationship of SES and ethnicity

with a set of CVD risk factors. Shea and
colleagues11 examined the independent
associations of educational attainment
and ethnicity (white, black, and His-
panic) with the primary CVD risk fac-
tors.Findingsweresimilartoours;how-
ever, the study was confined to New
York State, relied on self-reported data
from a telephone survey, and was lim-
ited by potential collinearity between
SES and ethnicity (eg, 5% of whites vs
22% of blacks and 38% of Hispanics had
not completed high school). Other CVD
studies that have been more limited in
scope(eg,restrictedto1ethniccompari-
son, 1 CVD risk factor, and/or 1 geo-
graphic area) have, in general, sup-
ported our findings of higher-risk fac-
tors among ethnic minority groups after
adjustment for SES.47
Strengths and Limitations
NHANES III is the most comprehen-
sive national survey to date with data on
CVD risk factors for black, Mexican
American, and white women. The sur-
vey included an oversampling of black
and Mexican American women, the 2
largest groups of ethnic minority wom-
en in the United States. Because
NHANES I and II did not include large
numbers of Mexican American women
and a related survey, the Hispanic
Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey, did not include white women,
NHANES III is the first such survey to
allow a comparison of Mexican Ameri-
can and white women. It also included
largenumbersofwomenattheextremes
of educational attainment. Extensive
and complete data are available from
both the home survey and medical ex-
amination, including individual-level
and family-level indicators of SES and
standardized measures of blood pres-
sure, lipid levels, and glucose levels.
Despite these strengths, our results
should be interpreted with caution be-
cause of several design and measure-
ment limitations. First, the cross-sec-
tional design of NHANES III limited
our ability to draw inferences about
causal pathways. For example, the on-
set of smoking, excess weight gain, and
physical inactivity usually occurs at
early ages, often before the completion
of formal education. Although we could
not determine from the data the tempo-
ral association between level of educa-
tion and these CVD risk factors, it is
more likely that SES influences risk of
disease than that risk of disease influ-
ences SES.38
Second, the NHANES III data con-
tained a potential for bias from self-
reported questions, such as those ques-
tions about smoking and physical activ-
ity. To verify self-reported smoking, we
used a biochemical measure, serum co-
tinine, that was available for all women
fromphaseIofthesurvey.Amongwom-
en who reported being nonsmokers, the
following percentages had positive re-
sults for cotinine: 8.2% of black women,
2.0% of Mexican American women, and
3.3% of white women, and 6.2%, 3.4%,
and 2.5% of women completing less than
12, 12, and more than 12 years of educa-
tion, respectively.Thus,theminimalun-
derreporting of smoking by Mexican
American women and women with
higher SES lends credence to our find-
ingoftheirlowsmokingrates.Fewstud-
ies have assessed reporting bias by eth-
nicity for physical activity measures;
however, we have seen no indications of
differential underreporting or overre-
porting by black, Mexican American, or
white women.61
Third, the NHANES III data used
only leisure-time activities to measure
overall physical activity. It is not sur-
prising that black and Mexican Ameri-
can women, who often have fewer re-
sources and less time to engage in
leisure-timephysicalactivitythanwhite
women, reported lower levels of activ-
ity. We did not anticipate, however, that
higher-educated black and Mexican
American women (those who had com-
pleted 12 years of education) would be
substantially more likely than white
womentoreportnoleisure-timeactivity
(27.8% and 18.0% compared with 12.3%,
respectively). The few questions avail-
able in NHANES III to assess physical
activity highlight the need for future
surveys to include measures such as to-
tal activity recall or energy expenditure
that better reflect overall activity levels
of women, regardless of ethnic and in-
come status.
Last, our primary measure of SES
(educational attainment) did not mea-
sure core beliefs and practices in rela-
tiontospecificCVDriskfactorsormedi-
cal conditions. Furthermore, it did not
provide the same economic benefits to
black and Mexican American women as
to white women.31 As shown in Table 1,
the likelihood of living below the pov-
erty level decreased with increasing
education,butlesssoforblackandMexi-
can American women than for white
women.
Recommendations
The striking ethnic and SES differ-
ences in CVD risk factors highlight the
need for reform in public health policies,
health care systems, and intervention
programs.19,62,63 Although past primary
and secondary CVD preventive efforts
have been effective in reaching white
womenandwomenwithhigherSES,they
have been less effective in reaching eth-
nic minority women and women with
lower SES.64,65 For example, of the wom-
en aged 25 to 64 years who participated
in the 3 large CVD community interven-
tion programs of the 1980s, more than
90%werewhite(non-Hispanic),andmore
than 75% had completed a high school
education or more.65 In addition, there is
strong evidence that white women and
women with higher SES obtain earlier
diagnoses for CVD-related conditions,
have better access to care, and are more
likelytobetreatedeffectivelythanother
women.66-69 These findings are consis-
tentwithresultsfromhealthservices re-
search and clinical trials that show that
white women and women with higher
SESaremorelikelythanAfricanAmeri-
can women and women with lower SES
tobescreened,diagnosed,andtreatedfor
hypercholesterolemia,70-72 and that white
women are more likely than Mexican
American women to receive treatment
for diabetes,73 hypercholesterolemia,74
and hypertension.67,75,76
The challenge for public health pro-
fessionals is to identify and understand
groups of women with high prevalences

effective interventions at the individual
andsocietallevelsthatwillbenefitthese
women. Public policies need to ensure
that ethnic minority women and women
withlowSESfromallethnicgroupshave
heart-healthy food choices, smoke-free
environmentsattheworkplace,andsafe
and convenient places to exercise.77
Health care systems need effective
protocols to reach ethnic minority wom-
en and women with low SES who often
experience differential access to health
care services17,78,79 because of cost barri-
ers, unavailability of health insurance,
and discrimination in health care.80,81
Health care systems need to reach high-
riskwomenwithscreeningprogramsfor
cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabe-
tes; provide more care (and more effec-
tive care) for chronic conditions such as
diabetes and hypertension; and create
better access to programs that address
smokingonsetorcessation,weightprob-
lems, high fat intake, and high choles-
terol levels.
Intervention programs, based on tar-
geted subgroup approaches, need to
identify high-risk populations, develop
strong and enduring partnerships with
communities,andtailorstrategiestothe
language and literacy needs, values, and
cultures of the populations.82,83 A tar-
geted subgroup approach should not
overshadow the essential need for popu-
lation-wide approaches to CVD preven-
tion, such as those shown to be impor-
tant during the 1980s and 1990s.84-87 The
public health challenge is to continue ef-
fective approaches to lowering CVD in
the overall population and to accelerate
changes in high-risk populations.47
Conclusion
Ourfindingsareespeciallyrelevantin
light of the global rise of CVD and other
chronic diseases that are influenced by
increasing prevalences of hypertension,
cigarette smoking, hypercholesterol-
emia, obesity, physical inactivity, and
diabetes. Our work builds on previous
studies that have documented dispro-
portionate suffering, disability, and pre-
mature death from CVD among ethnic
minority women and those with low
SES. Fortunately, CVD risk factors are
well established and their occurrence
can be largely prevented. Unfortu-
nately, CVD is not curable, a fact that
highlights the critical need for effective
primary and secondary preventive ef-
fortstolessenthesubstantialhealthdis-
advantages faced by ethnic minority
women and women with low SES.
