Age and Sex Differences in the Clustering
of Metabolic Syndrome Factors
Association with mortality risk
JENNIFER L. KUK, PHD

OBJECTIVE -- The metabolic syndrome is a general term given to a clustering of cardiom-
etabolic risk factors that may consist of different phenotype combinations. The purpose of this
study was to determine the prevalence of the different combinations of factors that make up the
metabolic syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program and to examine
their association with all-cause mortality in younger and older men and women.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A total of 2,784 men and 3,240 women from
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with public-access mortality data
linkage (follow-up  14.2  0.2 years) were studied.
RESULTS -- Metabolic syndrome was present in 26% of younger (aged 65 years) and
55.0% of older (aged 65 years) participants. The most prevalent metabolic syndrome combi-
nation was the clustering of high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and elevated blood pressure
in younger men (4.8%) and triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and elevated waist circumference in
younger women (4.2%). The presence of all five metabolic syndrome factors was the most
common metabolic syndrome combination in both older men (8.0%) and women (9.2%).
Variation existed in how metabolic syndrome combinations were associated with mortality. In
younger adults, having all five metabolic syndrome factors was most strongly associated with
mortality risk, whereas in older men, none of metabolic syndrome combinations were associated
with mortality. In older women, having elevated glucose or low HDL as one of the metabolic
syndrome components was most strongly associated with mortality risk.
CONCLUSIONS -- Metabolic syndrome is a heterogeneous entity with age and sex variation
in component clusters that may have important implications for interpreting the association
between metabolic syndrome and mortality risk. Thus, metabolic syndrome used as a whole may
mask important differences in assessing health and mortality risk.

Since the introduction of the meta-
bolic syndrome operational criteria
by the National Cholesterol Educa-
tion Program (NCEP) in 2001 (1), the
surveillance of metabolic syndrome has
garnered considerable research interest.
Metabolic syndrome has been shown to
be associated with increased all-cause and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality
risk (2,3), but, of late, the clinical utility of
metabolic syndrome has also been criti-
cized (4,5). One of the criticisms is that
because metabolic syndrome is opera-
tionalized as three or more of the five
components, the 16 possible combina-
tions that result may present with differ-
ent pathophysiology, consequences, and
treatment options, depending on which
factors are present. Indeed, studies that
have compared metabolic syndrome clus-
ters for their ability to predict mortality
have demonstrated variations in mortality
risk among the different metabolic syn-
drome operational definitions (6,7) and
the different metabolic syndrome clusters
or components (6,8).
However, it has also been reported
that the prevalence of each metabolic syn-
drome risk factor differs with sex (9,10),
and, thus, it follows that men and women
may be characterized by different meta-
bolic syndrome combinations. To date, it
is unclear whether these sex differences
are consistent across the life span and
whether the different combinations of
metabolic syndrome are similarly related
with mortality risk in younger and older
men and women. Thus, the purpose of
this study was to provide U.S. estimates of
the prevalence of the different metabolic
syndrome combinations and quantify the
risk of all-cause mortality for these unique
metabolic syndrome phenotypes in
younger and older men and women.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) is a nationally representative
cross-sectional survey conducted between
1988 and 1994 in 33,994 individuals, aged
2 months. The sample was collected us-
ing a stratified, multistage, probability clus-
ter design. Participants were examined at
home and at a mobile examination center
for various markers of health, such as de-
mographics, socioeconomic status, medical
history, dietary practices, physical activity,
blood profile, blood pressure, and anthro-
pometrics. Complete details of the study
design and procedures are reported else-
where (11,12).
A public access mortality linkage data
file with follow-up through 31 December
2006 was used for these analyses (13).
Mortality status was ascertained through a
probabilistic match to a National Death
Index record using Social Security num-
ber, name, and date of birth. Cause of
death coding followed ICD-9 and ICD-10
guidelines. All study participants gave
their informed written consent before
participation in the examination, and the
study protocol was approved by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics.
Participants were excluded if they were
missing any of the metabolic syndrome cri-
teria (n  27,740) or age (n  4,877), were
aged18years(n14,477),orwerepreg-
nant (n  196). This left a final sample of
2,784 men and 3,240 women.

Survey methods
Age, sex, income, ethnicity (white or non-
white), smoking status (never, current,
and former), physical activity (exercise
frequency 5 times/week), medications
(lipid, blood pressure, and diabetes), and
physician diagnosis of hypertension or di-
abetes were self-reported by question-
naire. Waist circumference was assessed
at the top of the iliac crest at the end of a
normal expiration (14).
Metabolic syndrome
Blood samples were collected with a veni-
puncture at the mobile examination cen-
ter or during the home examination.
Participants were instructed to fast for
10­16 h before the morning examination
or for 6 h before the afternoon or evening
examination. Blood pressure was manu-
ally measured by a physician at the home
examination after the participant had
been quietly seated for 5 min. Metabolic
syndrome was diagnosed as three or more
of the following five factors as defined by
the revised NCEP criteria (1): 1) fasting
triglycerides 1.69 mmol/l or lipid med-
ications; 2) systolic blood pressure 130
mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 85
mmHg, or antihypertensive medications;
3) fasting plasma glucose 5.6 mmol/l or
diabetes medications; 4) HDL cholesterol
1.04 mmol/l (men) or 1.29 mmol/l
(women); and 5) waist circumference
102 cm (men) or 88 cm (women).
Statistical analysis
All analyses were stratified by age (18­65
years and 65 years) and sex. Sex differ-
ences in the frequencies and prevalence of
each metabolic syndrome combination
within each age-group were determined
using a 2 test. To account for the poten-
tial effects of prevalent CVD on mortality
risk, participants with a reported history
of stroke or heart attack were excluded
from the mortality analyses. Cox propor-
tional hazards regression was used to as-
sess the relative risk of all-cause mortality
across metabolic syndrome definitions,
adjusting for age, sex, income, smoking
status, white ethnicity, and physical activ-
ity. Because of the low number of deaths
associated with some of the definitions,
the analyses were only conducted for met-
abolic syndrome definitions with one,
two, three, four, or all five factors with
each factor as a required component (i.e.,
three metabolic syndrome factors with
one of the factors being elevated glucose,
four metabolic syndrome factors with
one of the factors being low HDL cho-
lesterol, and so on). To account for the
hierarchical sampling structure of the
data, all statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS (version 9.1) survey
procedures or SUDAAN 10.0, weighted
to be representative of the U.S. popula-
tion. Statistical significance was set at
  0.05. We certify that all applicable
institutional and governmental regula-
tions concerning the ethical use of hu-
man volunteers were followed during
this research.
RESULTS -- Characteristics of partici-
pants are shown in Table 1. The preva-
lence of each metabolic syndrome factor
combination and the prevalence of having
one, two, three, four, or five metabolic
syndrome factors in younger and older
adults are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In
younger adults, the most common meta-
bolic syndrome component was low HDL
(41%), and the least common was high
glucose (22% in men and 17% in
women). In older adults, blood pressure
was the most common metabolic syn-
drome component (81% in men and 83%
in women), whereas triglycerides (45% in
men and 40% in women) and HDL (43%
in men and 42% in women) were the least
common factors.
Only 26% of younger participants
had metabolic syndrome (26.6% in men
and 25.1% in women), whereas 55.0% of
participants aged 65 years had meta-
bolic syndrome (55.5% in men and
54.7% in women). The most prevalent
metabolic syndrome combination was the
clustering of triglycerides, HDL, and
blood pressure in younger men (4.8%)
and of triglycerides, HDL, and waist cir-
cumference in younger women (4.2%),
whereas the least common metabolic syn-
drome combination was HDL, waist cir-
cumference, and glucose in younger men
(0.3%) and blood pressure, triglycerides,
and glucose in younger women (0.1%).
Overall, the presence of all five metabolic
syndrome factors was the most common
metabolic syndrome combination in both
older men and women (8.0% in men and
9.2% in women), whereas the least com-
mon was triglycerides, HDL, and glucose
in older men (0.5%) and HDL, waist cir-
cumference, and glucose in older women
(0.2%).
During the 14.0  0.2 year follow-up
there were 1,476 (16.8%) deaths (659

CVD, 331 cancer, 133 respiratory causes,
and 49 diabetes). In the crude unadjusted
model, metabolic syndrome was associ-
ated with higher mortality risk in younger
adults (men: hazard ratio [HR] 2.53 [95%
CI 1.66 ­3.85]; women 4.22 [2.36 ­
7.55]) and older women (1.44 [1.08­
1.92]). In contrast, metabolic syndrome
was not associated with mortality risk in
older men (0.78 [0.56­1.09]). Metabolic
syndrome remained significantly associ-
ated with all-cause mortality risk in
younger adults (men: 1.68 [1.13­2.50];
women: 2.61 [1.39­4.91]) but not in
older women (1.29 [0.97­1.72]) after ad-
justment for relevant covariates. In gen-
eral, age, smoking status and income were
the only significant covariates (P  0.05).
The association between the various
metabolic syndrome factor combinations
and mortality risk varied, and the patterns
differed by age and sex (Fig. 3). In
younger men and women, having all five
metabolic syndrome factors was most
strongly associated with mortality risk,
with no clear association between the
number of metabolic syndrome factors
and mortality risk (i.e., more metabolic
syndrome factors did not equal greater
mortality risk). In older men, the various
metabolic syndrome combinations were
not associated with elevated mortality
risk, whereas in older women, regardless
of the absolute number of metabolic
syndrome components, having elevated
glucose or low HDL was most strongly
associated with mortality. None of the
most prevalent metabolic syndrome
definitions within each age- and sex-
specific strata (i.e., younger men: blood
pressure, triglycerides, and HDL;
younger women: triglycerides, HDL,
waist circumference; and older adults:
all five criteria) were significantly asso-

CONCLUSIONS -- Results of this
analysis provide evidence that there are
age and sex differences in the way meta-
bolic syndrome is expressed and in the
way that the different metabolic syn-
drome combinations are associated with
mortality risk. This observation suggests
that metabolic syndrome is a heteroge-
neous entity and, when used as a dichoto-
mous outcome, may mask the differential
associations with health risk.
The clinical definitions for metabolic
syndrome are evolving (15,16), and it is
clear that the presentation of metabolic
syndrome is different between the sexes
and changes with age. As reported previ-
ously, abdominal obesity is the most com-
mon metabolic syndrome factor in
women (9). In fact, all combinations that
were more common in women than men
contained waist circumference, whereas
the metabolic syndrome combinations in
men were more heterogeneous in their
make-up. This finding may suggest a
greater relative importance of abdominal
obesity in the development of metabolic
risk in women than men. We have re-
ported previously in this cohort that an-
thropometric measures of obesity are
more strongly associated with mortality
risk in women than in men (17).
As expected, all metabolic syndrome
risk factors were more prevalent in the
older than younger adults; however, it
was interesting to note that the sex differ-
ences in the prevalence of the various
metabolic syndrome factor combinations
were largely abolished in older adults. In
the adults aged 65 years of age, 27 of 31
combinations of metabolic syndrome fac-
tors were equally prevalent in men and
women possibly because of the large
number of people developing metabolic
risk factors by the time they are aged 65
years (i.e., prevalence approaching
100%). However, upon closer inspection,
even in the older population, less than
half had an abnormal value for most of the
variables. Perhaps the diminished sex dif-
ferences in the metabolic risk profile may
be in part due to the diminished sex dif-
ferences in total and visceral adiposity
with age (18) and the cardiometabolic ef-
fects of menopause (19).
Metabolic syndrome is operational-
ized by NCEP for ease of use to be three or
more of the five components. However,
from these results, it is clear that the con-
sequences of the 16 possible combina-
tions may vary according to which factors
are present. Variation in the risk of CVD
morbidity and mortality associated with
the different metabolic syndrome pheno-
types has been described (7,20) and taken
together with our results suggests that im-
portant variations in mortality risk by
prevalent clusters of components may be
masked when metabolic syndrome is
used as a whole. Indeed, these results are
in accordance with a study by Guize et al.
(6) who reported that different combina-
tions of metabolic syndrome factors are
differently associated with risk of all-
cause mortality, wherein the combination
of waist, triglyceride, and glucose was
most strongly associated with all-cause
mortality. However, this study combined
men and women and used participants
with no metabolic syndrome factors as the
referent group. In the other study to date,
Hong et al. (8) also collapsed their sample
across men and women and did not ex-
amine differences with aging, beyond the
inclusion of age and sex as covariates. In
that study, clear differences in mortality
risk were demonstrated, along with a
clustering of blood pressure, triglycer-
ides, HDL, and glucose that was most
strongly associated with all-cause mortal-
ity risk. Demographic, covariate, and an-
alytical differences between these studies
and the current analysis make it difficult
to compare but provide some of the first
evidence that variation in mortality risk
may be an important consideration when
one is making treatment decisions on the
basis of metabolic syndrome combina-
tions. Indeed, differences in how the var-
ious metabolic syndrome combinations
relate to mortality risk may be in part due
to the differences in how these metabolic
syndrome combinations relate to incident
coronary heart disease, CVD, and type 2
diabetes morbidity wherein the effects are
even more pronounced (8,21).
Our results suggest that there are im-
portant sex and age differences in the way
the different metabolic syndrome combina-
tions relate to mortality risk; however, the
association between the various metabolic
syndrome combinations and mortality risk
does not appear to be related to their prev-
alence. For example, although HDL was
one of the most common metabolic syn-
drome components in younger women and
amongtheleastcommoninolderwomen,it
was one of the stronger correlates of mortal-
ity risk in both age strata. Furthermore, in
contrast with previous observations (22),
the association between metabolic syn-
dromeandmortalityriskdoesnotappearto
be related to the number of metabolic syn-
drome factors one displays. Although hav-
ing all five metabolic syndrome factors was
most strongly associated with mortality risk
in younger men and women, there was no
clear association between the number of
metabolic syndrome factors and mortality
risk. For example, in younger women, hav-

ing elevated waist circumference alone or
in combination with at least three other
metabolic syndrome factors was associated
with a similar HR for mortality (2.01 vs.
1.88, respectively). Similarly, in older
women, regardless of the absolute number
of metabolic syndrome components, hav-
ing elevated glucose or low HDL was asso-
ciated with a similar mortality risk. Clearly,
more research is needed to determine
whether certain specific combinations of
metabolic syndrome factors are more pre-
dictive of mortality risk.
The strengths and limitations of this
studywarrantmention.First,thisstudywas
conductedinalargecohortthatwasnation-
ally representative of the U.S. population.
Despitethelargeinitialsamplesizeandlong
follow-up, because of the low prevalence
and low number of deaths for some meta-
bolic syndrome definitions, we were unable
to examine the association between each of
the specific metabolic syndrome combina-
tions and mortality risk or specific causes of
deaths (i.e., CVD and cancer). This limita-
tionisprobablyalsoreflectiveofthecluster-
ing nature of the metabolic syndrome
factors, as they are risk factors for each
other.Further,therearereportedethnicdif-
ferences in the prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome factors (10). Whether these
differences also influence the association
with mortality risk requires further exami-
nation in diverse samples.
In summary, we suggest that there
are age and sex differences in the way
metabolic syndrome is expressed and in
the way that the different metabolic syn-
drome combinations are associated
with mortality risk. This suggestion re-
inforces the notion that metabolic syn-
drome is a heterogeneous condition that
may have differential associations with
health risk in men and women of differ-
ent ages.
