Introduction
Collecting and analyzing statistical data on national popula-
tions is a key dimension of being a modern state. Regular
national data collection exercises with the production of reli-
able and valid data are one way in which nations signal their
membership of a global community (Barrett & Tsui, 1999).
Increasing use of metrics to measure "development" and
"progress" toward achieving targets such as the Millennium
Development Goals means that statistical data are becoming
more important although much "data" produced by interna-
tional organizations such as the World Bank and the
International Labour Organization (ILO) are, in fact, guessti-
mates or extrapolations (Duncan, 2013; Jerven, 2013; Sanga,
2013).
Since its establishment in 1947 under the UN Department
of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Statistical
Division (UNSD) has been concerned with the systematic
organization and compilation of country-level statistics and
indicators (UNSD, 2013). The UNSD has encouraged postin-
dependenceAfrican states to standardize and streamline their
data collection and has provided definitions and guidelines
to be used in data collection and training (Ching'anda &
Ntozi, 1998). Key themes emitting from the UNSD are the
development of National Statistical Systems (NSS), regular
data collection, and improving and standardizing data collec-
tion to facilitate comparability.
A key concept in censuses and surveys is the definition
of household; this determines the units for which much data
are collected and analyzed, and thus influences the data that
are the basis for many policies. However, tensions emerge
between UN guidelines about standardization of household

Abstract
Since the 1950s, the UN Statistical Division has encouraged nations to standardize the definitions used in data collection. A
key concept in censuses and surveys is the household: This is the unit for which information is collected and analyzed, and
is thus an important dimension of data that are the basis for many policies. We aim to understand the tensions between
conformity with UN guidelines and national priorities. We analyze the documentation around the UN household definition
over this period. Using detailed census and survey documentary data for several African countries, especially Burkina Faso,
Senegal, Uganda, and Tanzania, we examine the disparities between national census definitions of "household" and the UN
definition. Perspectives from interviews with key informants within national statistical offices demonstrate the variability in
the importance accorded to the UN harmonization aims and the problems that arise when these standardized approaches
interact with local norms and living arrangements.

definitions and local residence patterns and social organiza-
tion; these are manifested through different national empha-
ses, such as the reduction of the UN phrase "joint provision
of food and other essentials" to eating together out of the
same cooking pot, or the addition of being subject to the
authority of a single household head.
This article has three aims: (a) to establish the extent to
which the UN guidelines influence national data collection
and how this has changed over time, (b) to identify key
dimensions of the UN household and how these are inter-
preted and implemented by nation states, and (c) to reflect on
national motivations for (non)compliance with UN guide-
lines. Throughout the article, we consider the role of compa-
rability in the evolution of definitions.
Method
Two research methods and data sources inform this work.
We review UN and national documentation on definitions
and concepts along with survey and census enumerators'
manuals in diverse African countries. We then focus on the
definition of the household and the collection and manage-
ment of household-level data in analyzing the relationship
between UN guidelines over the past 50 years and actual
practice in two Anglophone (Tanzania and Uganda) and
two Francophone (Senegal and Burkina Faso) African
countries. Further insight is provided by in-depth inter-
views in the same countries with individuals in different
positions within the hierarchy of National Statistical Offices
from retired and contemporary senior personnel to census
and survey enumerators (for more detail, see www.house-
holdsurvey.info).
UN Influence on Data Production
Most census and many household survey reports acknowl-
edge technical advice and help provided by outside agencies
(e.g., United Nations Population Fund [UNFPA], U.S.
Bureau of Census, United Nations Economic Commission
forAfrica [UNECA]), although it is rarely made explicit how
these relationships work in terms of decisions about defini-
tions and their operationalization. References in census doc-
umentation indicate the importance of conforming to UN
principles and this is a clearly articulated dimension of
national modernity.
The Tanzanian 1967 census report stated,
The census was conducted according to modern scientific
principles as summarized in recent recommendations by the
United Nations and its Economic Commission for Africa.
(United Republic of Tanzania, 1969, p. viii)
The introduction to the 1975 Burkinabe (Upper Volta)
census report states,
Undertaken within the framework of the African Census
Programme, [the census] fulfils the principal requirements of
the United Nations Statistical Commission (p. 5) . . . it forms an
important step towards the development of a modern system of
data collection (p. 6). (République de Haute-Volta, 1978,
pp. 5-6, our translation)
After a detailed history of colonial censuses, the introduc-
tion to the 1960 Ghana census report emphasizes,
The 1960 Population census of Ghana is a modern census carried
out according to the principles and recommendations laid down
by the United Nations. (Republic of Ghana, 1962, p. xi)
The Ghanaian administrative report reporting on the 1960
census states,
The concepts and classifications used in the Census were largely
based on international recommendations.Adaptations were made
to suit local conditions. (Republic of Ghana, 1964a, p. 112)
Frequent references to the United Nations in Ghana's doc-
umentation as far back as 1960 demonstrate the strong
awareness of the UN principles and definitions as these
guided the evolution of census data collection. But, because
of problems in making these definitions workable locally,
there are many adaptations. The Ghanaian census bureau's
move from collecting data for occupants of "houses" in 1960
and 1970 to "households" in 1984 is evidence of the influ-
ence of the international agenda and its concepts.
In general, Anglophone African censuses conducted late
in the colonial era and early in independence, although
dependent on outside funding and advice, were grounded in
detailed knowledge about local conditions and social organi-
zation. The guiding principle was to get the most accurate
census count (avoiding omissions and double counting
through a de facto1 approach) and using local vocabulary to
define enumeration units. The census was primarily pre-
sented as a national affair and part of postindependence
nation-state building.
Despite increasing impetus toward harmonized global
guidelines and frameworks for statistics (International defini-
tion and measurement of standards and levels of living [UN,
1954b], Framework for Social and Demographic Statistics
[UNSD, 1975]), it was not until the 1980s and 1990s, when
the Human Development Index was first produced, that data
produced by censuses and surveys really became interna-
tional goods: This may have generated greater pressure for
individual countries to conform in terms of concepts and defi-
nitions. Other non-UN international surveys, such as the
World Fertility Survey (late 1970s) had focused attention on
the comparative power of harmonized data. Recently the
demand for social statistics and indicators has grown signifi-
cantly (see UNGA, 2014), in part due to the need to monitor
progress toward goals agreed at international summits (e.g.,
Randall et al. 3
1990 World Summit for Children, 1994 International
Conference on Population & Development, 1995 World
Summit for Social Development, 1995 World Conference on
Women, Millennium Development Goals). Because house-
hold surveys and censuses are central to the production of
data, much UNSD work has focused on the production of
methodological guidelines (DESA, 2005, 2008a, 2008b).
Comparability
The 1954 UN Handbook of Population Census Methods
highlights the key role of comparability:
For the purposes of international comparability it is desirable
that a de facto enumeration be made; that is, a count of all the
persons present in the country at the time of enumeration. Any
data on a de jure basis which may be desired should be obtained
in addition to the de facto data. (UN, 1954a, p. 37)
Most Anglophone censuses followed this de facto
approach and some census instructions emphasized the
importance of the de facto enumeration over other concerns
as highlighted in the Ugandan enumerator's manual for
1969.
A household is defined as a group of persons who normally live
and eat together. This is a very loose definition and there may be
many cases when you are in doubt as to whether people should
be included in the same household or shown as belonging to
separate households. It is not possible in these instructions to
cover all such cases in detail, and your decision in such cases
should be determined by common sense and convenience in the
enumeration. It is not a matter of great importance whether or
not such persons are included in one household or shown
belonging to separate households. The important thing is that
every person should be enumerated. (Republic of Uganda, 1974,
p. 87, emphasis added)
"Comparability" is a dominant theme throughout UN
documentation, and it tends to take precedence over other
considerations such as local applicability of concepts. In
terms of the ways in which these influences affected prac-
tices in National Statistical Offices, the emphasis from the
United Nations is clear that they should
co-operate in the design of standard and uniform procedures for
sample surveys to obtain better indicators of levels of living.
(United Nations, 1954, cited in United Nations, 1964, p. 2)
and from the same report:
Discussion of the value of household inquiries, especially in
developing areas, was carried a step further by the Working
Group of Experts on Family Living Studies convened by the
International Labour Office in 1955. This group recommended
inter alia that the international agencies should aid in the
development of sound methods of study and encourage
international comparability by issuing lists of standard
definitions and classifications to be used in household enquiries.
(United Nations, 1964, p. 2)
The impetus from the United Nations toward comparabil-
ity and standardization over time is clear and focused on
countries in receipt of funding and technical support for sta-
tistical data collection. The comparability of statistics is an
important part of demographic training and our analyses of
discussions with higher level personnel within the Tanzanian
statistical office and international organizations make it clear
that preoccupations about comparability often overruled
other considerations about the validity of demographic data
(Randall, Coast, & Leone, 2011). However, although compa-
rability--over time within countries and over space between
countries--is frequently talked about, in practice, there are
significant deviations from this ideal.
Census enumeration units have become more standard-
ized over the last 50 years and most countries now use
"household" rather than another unit such as dwelling or
family. For example,
Gambia changed from the use of family/yard in 1963, to
household in 1983.
Malawi moved from using the dwelling unit to a house-
hold definition between 1977 and 1987.
South Africa moved from using the family to the house-
hold between 1985 and 1991.
However, although the term household is now ubiquitous,
the way it is locally defined and interpreted still varies
considerably.
UN Concept of Household
The UN documentation on household definition is extremely
consistent over time. In 1959, there were discussions about
two different approaches to household: the housekeeping
unit and household-housing unit concepts (United Nations,
1959), reproducing recommendations from the UN docu-
ment "Principles and Recommendations for National
Population Censuses":
A private household should preferably be defined as: (a) one-
person household: a person who lives alone in a separate housing
unit or who, as a lodger, occupies a separate room or rooms in a
part of a housing unit but does not join with any of the other
occupants of the housing unit to form part of a multi-person
household as defined below; or (b) multi-person household: a
group of two or more persons who combine to occupy the whole
or part of a housing unit and to provide themselves with food or
other essentials for living. The group may pool their incomes
and have a common budget to a greater or lesser extent. The
group may be composed of related persons only or of unrelated
persons or of a combination of both, including boarders but
excluding lodgers. (United Nations, 1959, p. 74)
4 SAGE Open
The key dimension here is "housekeeping," which
revolves around "provide themselves with food." This phrase
is itself ambiguous, as demonstrated by the example of two
wives of a polygamous man: both obtain the grain for their
meals from the family granary that is managed by their joint
husband. The granary is filled with grain cultivated on fields
"owned" by the husband and his lineage and worked on by
his wives and children. The wives take this grain and cook it
separately in different kitchens attached to their different
houses in the same compound and then feed themselves and
their children and each sends food to their husband. In this
common case, if "provide themselves with food" refers to
the source of food--the communal granary--then both
wives, their husband, and any dependent children (and oth-
ers) will form one household. However if "provide with
food" is interpreted as being related to the cooking and eat-
ing of the food, thus focusing on the "cooking pot," each
wife constitutes a separate household, and a somewhat arbi-
trary decision is made about which household the husband is
assigned to.
Despite this ambiguity, the wording of the UN definition
of household for censuses barely changes over the next few
decades. In 1980,
The concept of "household" is based on the arrangements made
by persons, individually or in groups, for providing themselves
with food or other essentials for living. (DESA, 1980, p. 50)
And in 1997,
1.324. The concept of household is based on the arrangements
made by persons, individually or in groups, for providing
themselves with food or other essentials for living.
1.325. The concept of household provided in paragraph 1.324 is
known as the housekeeping concept. It does not assume that the
number of households and housing units is equal . . .
1.326 . . . Some countries use a concept different than the
housekeeping concept described in the previous paragraph,
namely, the "household-dwelling" concept, which regards all
persons living in a housing unit as belonging to the same
household. (According to this concept, there is one household
per occupied housing unit.) In the household-dwelling concept,
then, the number of occupied housing units and the number of
households occupying them are equal and the locations of the
housing units and households are identical. However, this
concept can obscure information on living arrangements, such
as doubling up, that is relevant for evaluating housing needs.
The definition of household most often used in national censuses
conducted during the 1990 round of censuses incorporates both
the housekeeping and household-dwelling concepts. (DESA,
1997, p. 50)
In referring to both housekeeping and household-dwell-
ing, the final sentence of this quote highlights the lack of
clarity and consistency even in standardized approaches. All
the definitions require cohabitation although the UN docu-
mentation demonstrates the subtle differences between
households defined on coresidence alone and those based on
housekeeping where the definition is ultimately is trying to
capture an economic unit. However, as elucidated below, the
housekeeping concept gets reduced in some contexts (par-
ticularly Anglophone East Africa) to cooking and eating
together, which is then prioritized in national definitions. In
such cases, culturally determined patterns of cooking and
coeating come to be the principal defining characteristic of
the household rather than having a common budget.
Interviews with statisticians and other individuals along
the chain of data production and use in African statistical
offices revealed that many see the UN definition of the
household (and their own national interpretation of this) as
an alien concept that has been developed for statistical and
demographic analysis, under demands for comparability,
rather than something that represents a fundamental and
locally relevant social unit. It is a technical term that needs to
be learnt and then applied to generate the "comparable" sta-
tistics required.
Local Understanding or Comparable
Units?
Although the UN explanations clarify the difference between
a housekeeping household and a household-dwelling, trans-
lating this into units of data collection may be difficult in the
field. Furthermore, data collection in multilingual contexts
requires ways for enumerators to explain to respondents the
units for which data are being collected (Randall, Coast,
Compaore, & Antoine, 2013). Hence, a tension arises
between the UN household unit and actual living arrange-
ments (Guyer, 1981; Guyer & Peters, 1987).
Households in early Botswana censuses were based on
local knowledge and vocabulary about social organization,
with an anthropologist cited as the source for the explanation
of the enumeration unit.
The household is the smallest well defined social unit and, in
Professor Shapera's words, "It consists basically of a man with
his wife or wives, and their unmarried children, but often
includes one or more married sons, brothers or even daughters,
with their respective families." Every household has its own
compound, known as a "lolwapa," consisting of one or more
huts and a granary within a courtyard surrounded by a reed
fence, a wooden palisade, a low earthen wall or something
similar. In most cases therefore the household is an easily
recognised physical entity and it formed the basic enumeration
unit. It is the compound which is referred to as the "dwelling"
and not the individual huts within it, and the people living within
the compound are referred to as the household. (Republic of
Botswana, 1972, p. 9)
This 1972 definition makes no reference at all to house-
keeping, provision, or consumption of food. By 1981,
Randall et al. 5
Botswana's approach to the household had moved away
from local anthropological references and closer to the UN
housekeeping approach.
In general those who live in a "lolwapa" or its equivalent should
be shown as one household if they eat from the same pot.
Otherwise they should be regarded as separate households.
(Republic of Botswana, 1983, p. A15)
Local vocabulary is retained but the issue of eating from
the same cooking pot is introduced, with the interpretation of
the UN's "common provision for food" becoming "eating
from the same pot."
Ghana's earlier censuses also grappled with how to apply
a standardized definition of the household:
For the unit of enquiry the household was proposed. But owing
to difficulties of definition which enumerators were expected
to encounter it was decided to record in the census individuals
by house or compound and to use the household concept only
in the PES [Post-enumeration survey]. It was realised that the
house or compound may not necessarily correspond to
particular economic or social concepts. (Republic of Ghana,
1964b, p. 112)
Later the report does define "household" as used in the
postenumeration survey (PES):
The definition adopted finally in the PES, "a person or group of
persons all living and eating together from the same cooking
pot" was in fact, a slightly modified version of the United
Nations concept adopted to suit the African social environment.
(Republic of Ghana, 1964b, p. 326)
Compared with the 1959 UN household definition of
"provide themselves with food and other essentials for liv-
ing," this 1964 Ghanaian definition is actually very different,
and potentially a smaller unit--specifically talking about
eating out of the same cooking pot--a phraseology that is
never used in the UN documentation.
Having undertaken the 1960 and 1970 census using
houses as the unit, in 1984, Ghana moved to households and
housekeeping.
A household was defined as follows: "a household consists of a
person or group of persons who live together in the same house
or compound, share the same housekeeping arrangements and
are catered for as one unit. . . . For instance two brothers who
live in the same house with their wives and children may or may
not form separate households depending on their catering
arrangements. . . . A usual member of household was considered
to be any person who, whether present or absent on Census
Night has spent (i.e. lived together in the same house or
compound, shared the same housekeeping arrangements and
been catered for as one unit with the other members of the
household) at least the last 6 months with the household."2
(Republic of Ghana, 1984, pp. xiii-xiv)
This definition (and that of the 2000 census) uses "cater-
ing arrangements" rather than cooking pot and is close to the
UN definition.
Sometimes, the interpretation of the UN guidelines
remains ambiguous. For example, in the (de facto) 1987
Malawian census,
A household consisted of one or more persons, related or
unrelated, who make common provision for food and who
regularly take their food from the same pot and/or share the
same grainhouse (nkhokwe) or pool their incomes together for
the purpose of purchasing food. (Government of Malawi, 1987,
p. 9)
The same definition was used in 1998 and in the census
report on households and household characteristics it is
referred to as "the UN definition" (Government of Malawi,
1998, p. 120). Clearly, the UN vocabulary is seen as an
important guiding role. However the inclusion of "and/or"
makes this a more inclusive unit than a "cooking pot" inter-
pretation of "provide themselves with food."
In most cases, we can discern the ways different countries
manage to combine UN guidelines with local social organi-
zation through instructions within manuals or comments in
reports. In Tanzania, a key-informant interview provided a
clear insight into work undertaken to simultaneously inte-
grate local vocabulary with the requirements generated by
comparability and conformity with the UN concepts.
So when we, at NBS (in mid 1970s) when we sent and we
discussed this in meeting and we said well, we now have to look
for a word in Kiswahili--there were suggestions more than
one--as usual--we said well we have the National Kiswahili
Council and we have the Department of Kiswahili at UDSM
[University of Dar Es Salaam]. We shall send them the definition
of the household as we know it from the UN now we shall ask
them to suggest what is it the Kiswahili equivalent that would fit
that UN definition, that long thing . . . they also came up with the
kaya. Kaya is the arrangement that best suits that definition of
the household from the UN. (Senior retired Tanzanian
statistician/demographer)
In Tanzania, with its national language and a clear desire
to follow UN requirements, there was a deliberate move
toward a particular word based on a well-articulated piece of
research undertaken to specifically identify the best local
term. However, in many contexts (including multilingual
Tanzania), there are real problems matching the UN concept
onto a slightly different concept or word that already exists in
a local language (Randall et al., 2013), as shown here for
Burkina Faso.
It's very difficult [in Fulfulde] to find a word like that, but, well,
following the definition which has been agreed before the
fieldwork, we are forced to explain it. On top of that you add
extra things. For example if we say that they have to pool the
results of their production, to translate that into Fulfulde . . . [in
6 SAGE Open
the field] when we go people often say, well there are the old
men, but we, we have our definitions which are there and we are
forced to say even though the old man is there that doesn't mean
to say that we can't have different households . . . the definitions
are there to respond to needs, it's a standard definition that's
there. (Burkina Faso; statistician and former Institut National de
la Statistique et de la Démographie [INSD] enumerator)
This tension is reiterated by a UNFPA advisor
But the majority of these surveys they get the definition from
[the statistical office] and they try to use it. Unfortunately what
happens is, where the respondents have their own perceptions
and also the enumerator they have their own perceptions. A lot
of the data that we get in this part of the world is indicative of
this question, it's not quite perfect information because of this
confusion. (UNFPA advisor, East Africa)
Where the UN definition is adopted by the statistical
office but there are no clear ways of translating it into local
languages, then the definition needs to be broken down into
its constituent parts and explained to both data collectors
and respondents. It seems to be these explanations of the UN
definition in recent years that have led the definitions down
a route we identify as the "cooking pot" pathway. The sim-
plest interpretation of arrangements . . . for providing them-
selves with food or other essentials for living is to say "those
people who eat out of the same cooking pot," which in some,
but not all, contexts is the group who also provisions
together to fill that cooking pot. This emerges clearly in
Uganda.
A household has got a standard definition. We look at two
elements to define a household. The first one--actually the most
important--is the eating area. People must be dining together.
They may live together but as long as they are not feeding from
the same pot, then those ones are different households. (Uganda
Bureau of Statistics [UBOS] statistician, Uganda)
However, eating out of the same cooking pot is only a
very limited interpretation of the UN definition and one that
moves away from the original goal of a definition attempting
to capture society's basic economic consumption unit. There
may be culturally prescribed patterns of cooking and eating
together--such as in polygamous populations where every
wife cooks in her hut for her children, yet the economic unit
of production and consumption is much wider and would put
all those wives in one "household." In other contexts, the
distribution of a very large household around several cook-
ing pots may be purely practical but would lead to several
census households.
Over time, the guidance from the UNSD has become
more detailed although not necessarily with clear explana-
tions about how to resolve perennial practical issues. The
tensions between the statistical definition of the household
and its operationalization in field data collection are well
established:
While the household concept has not been widely contested as a
consumption unit, questions have been raised regarding its
meaning as a production unit or income generating unit. The
main argument is that persons living in the same housing unit
who together make provision for food and other essential items
may not necessarily pool their income or make decisions jointly
regarding their economic activities. Various situations may arise
in different societies. For example, in manyAfrican communities
an extended family comprising several households may own and
cultivate a field together, while cooking and housekeeping
arrangements are still made separately by each household level.
The consumption unit may also include persons who do not
reside with the household although they regularly take their
meals in common. The usual concept of household may therefore
require considerable adaptation or elaboration in order to be
applied consistently in particular societies. (UNSD, 1984, p. 99)
The final sentence is informative about the problematic
relationship between UN guidelines and local implementa-
tion of them because no advice is given about how this adap-
tationmightbeachievedwhilestillmaintainingcomparability.
Most countries have ignored this UN awareness of the com-
plexity of African households and oriented their definitions
around the minimal group of those who live, cook, and eat
together.
The 1997 Principles and Recommendations for Population
and Housing Censuses (DESA, 1997) dedicated two pages to
explaining the concept of the household, its different dimen-
sions, and how these things should be recorded. The explana-
tion still commences with "[those] who make common
provision for food or other essentials for living" (DESA,
1997, p. 65) but then develops a wealth of detail and clarifi-
cation. Interestingly, a key concept in many national defini-
tions, that of eating together out of the same pot, is not
mentioned.
Case Study Countries: Diversity in
Evolution of Definitions
Our comparative case study countries were selected because
they experienced different colonial histories and postcolonial
political ideologies, with contrasting geographic and linguis-
tic settings. Yet all are members of the United Nations and all
have invested considerably in statistical development. We
aim to establish where there are clear temporal trends across
the countries in terms of their relationship with the UN defi-
nitions and guidelines, which remained constant throughout
the half century with "joint provision of food or essentials of
living." Table 1 summarizes the dominant criteria of each
national definition over time and is based on detailed extracts
from census documentation (see the appendix).
The documentation for the 1975 Burkina Faso (then
Upper Volta) census identifies compounds and households
with a somewhat confusing overlapping use of "family"
(République de Haute-Volta, 1978). Households were enu-
merated within compounds and a household could only
Randall et al. 7
include one married man with his wives and unmarried
dependants. There is no mention of provision of food or
housekeeping. In all subsequent censuses (1985, 1996,
2006), Burkina Faso follows some aspects of the UN defini-
tion closely by requiring co-residence and common provi-
sion of food and daily life, but it also requires the recognition
of a household head and that a household cannot contain two
married couples. Both these conditions diverge from the UN
guidelines, and the latter hinders comparability with other
countries. The report on the Burkina 1985 census specifi-
cally recognizes:
As it is defined here [i.e. one married couple per household], the
household loses its meaning as an economic and production
unit. The notion of household has principally been used in the
census as a control variable to ensure exhaustive enumeration.
(INSD, 1989, p. 284)
The 1985 census report tables on données collectives

collectives focus on characteristics of households and their
heads and the report section starts with "The household consti-
tutes the basic socio-economic unit" (INSD, 2000, p. 271).
Tanzanian censuses are de facto, and the 1967 census fol-
lowed the UN definition closely. In the 1970s, those living
geographically close but in separate houses could be part of
the same household if they eat together, thus prioritizing the
cooking pot. In 1988 and 2002, there is no mention of eating
together, but shared living costs are the criterion for house-
hold membership. It is unclear how "shared living costs"
could possibly be operationalized in a de facto census and
the enumerators we interviewed interpreted the guidelines as
meaning eating together.
Uganda's de facto censuses utilize a restricted interpreta-
tion of "joint provision of food or essentials of living" sum-
marized as "eating together." This cooking pot dimension is
prioritized by all our Ugandan key informants.
Senegal is totally different from bothAnglophoneTanzania
and Uganda, and other Francophone countries, with clear
definitions that prioritize what are seen to be Senegalese char-
acteristics. Pilon and Vignikin (2006) show that in all com-
parativeanalyses(censusorsurveys)Senegalhassubstantially
larger households than any other African country; this is
probably a consequence of their approach to definitions. In
1976, Senegal avoided the problems posed by the household
by avoiding the concept altogether and de jure enumerating
compounds (concessions) and their constituent family nuclei
(noyaux). In 1988 and 2002, Senegal abandoned this approach
for the household (ménage), defined as living together in the
same compound, eating together, and under the authority of
one head of household: subsequent clarifications indicate that
living together takes precedence over eating together. Clear
examples of the enumeration units were given by providing
local words (see the appendix), which almost certainly means
that during enumeration these local words were used in pref-
erence to any precise definition.
Each country has taken a different route to reconciling
local conditions with the UN definition. Whereas Tanzania
made huge efforts to conform to the United Nations, Uganda
concentrated on a particular interpretation of UN "joint pro-
vision" by focusing on the cooking pot. Senegal has largely
remained detached from UN recommendations apart from
changing from concessions and noyaux to "households." By
retaining the importance of the household head and the use
of local words, it is clear that they are prioritizing local orga-
nization rather than international comparability. Burkina
Faso complied with much UN wording but added local pri-
orities about married couples.
Census: Household Structure and
Relationships Within Them
Early census data were collected on people within "house-
holds" because that was the most effective way of enumerating
the whole population (Republic of Uganda 1974, appendix).
Relationships within households, and household structure,
have become an increasingly important dimension of house-
hold data collection because of their importance for under-
standing support and welfare. UN documentation provides
detailed guidelines for household composition data collection
but national censuses oscillate between following UN guidance
and trying to cope with making these data meaningful locally.
The practical problems of recording standardized relationships
within the statistical household are well established:
Traditional kinship systems especially in developing countries,
may permit several interpretations of "mother," "brother,"
"sister," "wife," "widow" and other kin and therefore, special
knowledge is required in order to translate data based on these
relationships into internationally comparable form. (United
Nations, 1964, p. 33)
UN advice acknowledges challenges of application in the
field while exhorting the need for comparability.
After identification of the head or other reference member of the
household, each of the remaining members of the household
should be distinguished in relation to that person, as appropriate,
as one of the following: (a) spouse, (b) child, (c) spouse of child,
(d) grandchild or great-grandchild, (e) parent (or parent of
spouse), (f) other relative, (g) domestic employee or (h) other
person not related to the head or other reference member. Where
this classification is considered too detailed for successful
collection of the information, categories (e) and (f) may be
consolidated as Other relative and (g) and (h) can be consolidated
as Other unrelated person. (DESA, 1997, p. 66)
Collecting data on household structure via relationship
with the household head assumes that household head is a
valid concept and that individuals are members of that house-
hold through their relationship with that person. This may gen-
erate problems of coherence in de facto data collection when
the household head is absent or for de jure approaches, when
the recognized household head has been absent for longer than
the residential cutoff (often 6 months). By only allowing a lim-
ited number of relationships with the household head, locally
coherent household structures can be obscured.
This limited classification may work well in populations
where most households are small and constituted of nuclear
families or their close derivatives. Its ability to represent the
diversity and complexity of many African households, let
alone contribute to understanding how support is provided
for the socially or physically vulnerable (a stated aim of the
data collection), is limited.
Whereas the importance of understanding changing
household composition was recognized in early UN docu-
mentation, approaches to this issue have not really been
revisited in Africa in the light of new computer technology
and the possible inappropriateness of the categories.
Relationships could now be recorded in more meaningful
ways to include relationships between different household
Randall et al. 9
members while retaining comparability by simultaneously
recording relationships to household head. The potential
comparative analysis of household structure from the differ-
ent codes in recent censuses (Table 2) is very limited.
Not every country follows UN guidelines. Ghanaian
reports on the 1970 census repeated earlier concerns that the
UN relationships did not match well onto African usage
(Republic of Ghana, 1975, p. xi):
The conventional relationship titles which are so deeply rooted
in African society had to be avoided so as to make analysis of
the household pattern meaningful. (Republic of Ghana, 1964b,
p. 327)
This led to the development of a large number of detailed
codes such as "mother's brother's son/daughter." In 1970,
because of the de facto enumeration, temporary heads (99)
had a different code to head (11). There were 14 relationship
codes for people in the house who were relatives of the
head--and a code for those who were relatives of the head's
spouse (Republic of Ghana, 1975, p. xiv).
Other deviations from UN guidelines are observed in
Kenya. In 1962, the census form instructs "relationship to
head of household." In 1969, this has become "relationship"
and in 1979 "what is the relationship of this person to the
head of household or other members of the household?" The
enumerator instructions state that

sometimes a person is related to more than one person in the
household. In such cases concentrate first on relating parents
and their children, then on relating husbands and wives and then
on relating persons to the head of household or other members
of it. (Republic of Kenya, 1981, p. 19)
These confusing instructions are followed by indications
that they should write things like "daughter of 4" using line
numbers. In 1989, Kenyan relationship codes reverted back
to a precise repetition of the UN guidelines to record rela-
tionship to the head of household (Republic of Kenya, 1989).
Uganda's 1991 census questionnaire also asked for relation-
ship to head or other member of household. It is not clear
why these more flexible and informative approaches have
been abandoned, but it might be the influence of interna-
tional standardization and comparability.
Yet again, Senegal demonstrates its independent approach
to data collection. In 1976, people were enumerated in com-
pounds and family nuclei within the compound. It is explained
thus: The familial nucleus (noyau) is the smallest possible
family cell that can exist and is constituted by the spouses (or
one spouse) and their directly descended unmarried descen-
dants who must live in the same compound. By extension, the
same family nucleus can include a husband with several
wives and their unmarried children living in the same com-
pound and direct ascendants (mother of the head of the family
nucleus), brothers and sisters, and close unmarried kin (neph-
ews, nieces, uncles, etc.) on condition that they live with the
head of the familial nucleus and do not have their own unmar-
ried children in the compound. This is identical to the unit
called "household" in the Burkinabe censuses.
Although this notion was abandoned for the subsequent
two censuses, it was reinstated in the 2013 census where the
enumerator's manual states,
The familial nucleus corresponds to the "biological" family. It is
made up of the parents (or one of the parents) and their unmarried/
unpartnered direct descendants (biological children). Thus a
household can be made up of one or several familial nuclei. Note
that a polygamous household which includes unmarried children
makes up one single nucleus if all the members live and take their
meals together in the same compound.Anucleus can also include
direct ascendants, brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts,
grandchildren, unmarried nephews and nieces who are supported
by the head of the nucleus.
Enumerating household members depends on the principle of
the closest kin link. The household head is the first person to
record on the questionnaire. Then you enumerate close kin of
the household head before moving onto distant kin and those
with no kinship link with him, keeping track, where possible
each person's membership of a specific familial nucleus.
(République du Sénégal, 2013, p. 51, our translation)
Key informant interviews indicate that many Senegalese
researchers and statisticians consider that this idea of nucleus
and the relationships within it captures the essence ofAfrican
familial and household structure.
It [familial nucleus] is an excellent thing, especially for censuses.
It helps us avoid many errors, because the concept of noyau
allows you, when you are in a household, which is usually
polygamous, to be certain that you have first identified all the
biological children for each wife and all the other people who
have no biological links with the household head. And there is
the advantage that, when you are with a polygamous couple you
can, for each wife, identify her biological children and the
children who are related by more distant kinship links. So if you
do that you can be sure that you haven't omitted a single person,
because when you are interested in the biological family what is
certain is that there is a strong chance no-one will be left out . . . .
It's a way of checking, but also for analysis, it allows you in
some way to have a good understanding of the exact composition
of the household. But particularly for data collection this
approach ensures exhaustivity. (Statistician: Agence Nationale
de la Statistique et de la Démographie [ANSD])
Senegal has also used "noyaux" in surveys and has thus
approached the problems of enumerating complex African
families and their residential and economic arrangements
through local management of data collection rather than fol-
lowing the UN guidelines.
Households in Nationally
Representative Surveys: The Influence
of Censuses
Censuses and surveys have rather different purposes; com-
plete enumeration for censuses versus in-depth information
for surveys. However, because the establishment of statisti-
cal offices to conduct censuses generally preceded sample
survey development, alongside pressure for comparability,
the influence of established UN census design and concepts
on survey definitions is clear:
The problems of definition encountered are common to
population enumeration in any context; therefore, it is suggested
that, where the difficulties have been faced and a satisfactory
definition of a household has been evolved for purposes of
population census, it will usually be desirable to adopt that for
sample surveys also. In most cases this will be the international
standard definition of private household, developed to promote
international comparability in population census results. (United
Nations, 1964, p. 10)
The merits of standardization were promoted by interna-
tional organizations at an early stage:
Discussion of the value of household inquiries, especially in
developing areas, was carried a step further by the Working
Group of Experts on Family Living Studies convened by the
International Labour Office in 1955. This group recommended
inter alia that the international agencies should aid in the
Randall et al. 11
development of sound methods of study and encourage
international comparability by issuing lists of standard
definitions and classifications to be used in household enquiries.
(United Nations, 1964, p. 2)
Comparisons of the definitions used in most recent house-
hold surveys in our sample countries suggest that this stan-
dardization and harmonization has not been achieved despite
the production of national and international documents spe-
cifically outlining harmonized concepts (e.g., National
Bureau of Statistics [NBS], 2005; UBOS, 2012).
The 1964 United Nations Statistics Office document did
recognize that global diversity might present problems for
standardized approaches:
--problems of application of household definition in "under-
developed" countries "where variations from the so-called
`normal' family structure are present" . . .
--in such circumstances, application of the recommended
international definition of a household requires care. (United
Nations, 1964, p. 12)
One assumes that "normal family structure" referred to
nuclear families, themselves now considerably eroded in
many contexts where they might once have been considered
to be "normal" (Cherlin, 2012).
UN documentation recognizes the problems the standard-
ization enterprise has set in Africa, especially with respect to
survey data collection, as surveys cover diverse issues for
which different definitions may be more appropriate.
However, it remains unclear whether it is expected that
respondents should be reconfigured to make them fit with the
definition, as in Uganda, or the definition should be used
flexibly to be able to match local conditions, as in Senegal.
Conclusion
A number of themes emerge from this investigation of the
role of UN guidelines in determining the collection of census
data in Africa.
There is a temporal transformation with early postinde-
pendence censuses preoccupied with a complete enumera-
tion of the population and avoiding double counting and
omissions. The units of data collection reflected this, and
utilization of local terminology or very strict de facto
approaches were strategies used to do the best "counting"
operation possible. Being able to undertake a competent and
exhaustive census was seen as an essential part of the mod-
ern state. Issues of comparability or sophisticated analysis of
the nature and structure of the units for which data were col-
lected were largely ignored.
In the 1970s and 1980s, the movement toward referring to
UN guidelines in the census documentation of individual
countries, the use of "household," and the reiteration of UN
notions of household became more important. However, a
major problem arose, and persists, because of ambiguity in
the UN definition of household and the fact that it referred to
three criteria: residence, housekeeping, and provision of food.
Different countries have emphasized these criteria in different
ways, and in some, the provision of food has been reduced to
those eating out of the same cooking pot (e.g., Uganda); this
is a minimalist interpretation of the UN requirements of "pro-
vision of food" which may, when applied strictly, split basic
socioeconomic units into smaller components because of
social diversity in eating behaviors. Other countries integrate
concepts into their definitions, which are not mentioned in the
UN but are seen as locally important like "answer to one
household head." In Burkina Faso, the continued restriction
of census households to one married couple is a further elabo-
ration away from the UN guidelines.
Senegal stands out as a nation with confidence in its own
statistical collection and approaches. Even after adopting the
UN terminology of household (ménage), the instructions
retained local language terms, an approach abandoned else-
where in Africa after the 1960s and which probably explains
the consistently larger household sizes observed in
Senegalese census and survey data compared with other
countries The structure of Senegalese data collection retains
this independence with many surveys retaining the idea of
"noyaux" and the census returning to it.
This article aimed to provide a historical account and
analysis of the changing relationships between individual
African countries, their national data collection activities,
and the United Nations through the lens of the definition of
household. It is beyond the scope of the research reported on
here to determine the extent of repercussions of these defini-
tional evolutions on policy. Furthermore, as policies should,
in theory, be based on a triangulation of diverse data sources,
as well as be driven by political strategies, it would be of
great concern if definitions alone could be shown to have
directly influenced policies. Nevertheless, the indicators
generated from census and survey data can be powerful tools
in orienting development initiatives. Cross-national compar-
isons are increasingly used in the tracking of development
goals. If analysts and policy makers are not clear about the
different ways in which the same terminology household is
operationalized and applied in different settings, then the
quality of such comparisons is undermined.
Census households matter beyond facilitating the enumera-
tion of individuals because, increasingly, research and policies
do not focus on the characteristics of individuals but on the
characteristics of the social units within which they live. This
focus is demonstrated in the Republic of Kenya Strategic Plan
"The household is central to the development process. Not
only is the household a production unit but it is also a con-
sumption, social and demographic unit" (Kenya, 2003, p. 59),
with similar phrases echoed elsewhere. If interventions are
focused on the "household" units for which policy makers
have data, the characteristics of those households become
important. Thus, wherever the definition influences the char-
acteristics of the household, there will be repercussions for the
conclusions drawn from analyses of those characteristics. Two
12 SAGE Open
examples illustrate this: The first constitutes analyses that
focus on the characteristics of the household head and its asso-
ciation with, or influence on, the well-being or characteristics
of different members: Such analyses could provide informa-
tion on the sorts of households where children are more or less
likely to be schooled, or those identified as economically or
socially vulnerable such as female-headed households. In the
latter case, definitions that depend primarily on cooking pot
organization will often lead to high frequency of female-
headed households in regions where polygamy is widespread
and where polygamous wives cook separately such as Maasai
areas of Kenya and Tanzania (Kenya, 2005; Randall & Coast,
2015). A second example draws on analyses that focus on the
size and structure of households: Analyses of census data such
as Ruggles and Heggeness's (2008) work on intergenerational
coresidence in developing countries are particularly sensitive
to household definitions. Burkina Faso was not part of that
study, but the fact that in census data Burkinabe elderly mar-
ried couples are, by definition, separated into different house-
holds whether they eat or live together with offspring, would
have given an erroneous picture of intergenerational coresi-
dence. Analysis of both household size and proportion of
female-headed households for our study countries did demon-
strate quite considerable difference between the results gener-
ated by the census definition and those of surveys (Golaz,
Antoine, Randall, & Coast, 2012). A focus on the living
arrangements of older people is becoming an important dimen-
sion of evaluating welfare and, as highlighted in a recent
review of the SAGE study in Ghana "the social opportunities
and challenges of the evolving living arrangements in Ghana
will be worthy of consideration in national policy discussions"
(Biritwum et al., 2013, p. 11). Policy makers are interested in
what analysis of living arrangements reveals, and these analy-
ses are sensitive to household definitions.
A number of tensions emerge: between the requirement for
comparability over time and space (recognized by all docu-
mentation in all countries) and the need to accommodate
changing social contexts (urbanization etc.) and diverse forms
of social organization; the desire to do the best data collection
possible, which in the census means enumerating everyone
once and once only; and the national recognition that this may
not be achievable through using the UN definition of house-
hold. The fundamental tension seems to be that of applying a
concept of household that remains largely Eurocentric and
organized around complete enumeration where most house-
holds are composed of small nuclear families or fragments of
them, to the rather different and dynamic living arrangements
in much of Africa. Different nations have chosen different
approaches. In some cases, the UN definition is adopted (and
slightly modified) and these households become the some-
what alien statistical category just used for data collection
(Uganda), whereas others, like Senegal have forged their own,
more independent pathway. The increased power of computer-
aided data collection, entry, and processing means that simul-
taneously collecting and organizing both standardized,
internationally comparable data, and locally defined and rele-
vant data on the ways in which people live should be possible,
and is desirable for policy makers and researchers alike.

A household is a group of persons
who live together and share their
living expenses. Usually, this will
be the husband, wife and children.
Other relatives, boarders,
visitors, and servants should
be included as members of the
household if they were present
in the household on census
night. Persons living alone should
be considered as a separate
household.
The existence of polygamous
households in Tanzania was
one of the problems facing field
staff in the enumeration (United
Republic of Tanzania, 1971, p. 85)
A household is defined as a group of
persons who normally live and eat
together. This is a very loose definition
and there may be many cases when
you are in doubt as to whether people
should be included in the same household
or shown as belonging to separate
households. It is not possible in these
instructions to cover all such cases in
detail, and your decision in such cases
should be determined by common sense
and convenience in the enumeration.
It is not a matter of great importance
whether or not such persons are included
in one household or shown belonging
to separate households. The important
thing is that every person should be
enumerated. Difficult cases generally
occur in towns rather than rural areas,
and here, common sense should always
be followed (Republic of Uganda, 1974,
p. 87).

A private household is a group
of persons who live together
and share their living expenses.
Usually this means husband,
wife, and children. Other
relatives, boarders, visitors,
and servants must be included
as members of the household
if they were present on census
night.
Family members staying in more
than one house, however close
they may be, will be included in
the same household if they live
and eat together (United Republic
of Tanzania, 1982, p. 92).
De facto: If a member of the
household usually lives at home
but is away on census night--do
not enumerate him--he will be
enumerated where he actually
is. If however he is away because
of nightwork then he must be
enumerated (United Republic of
Tanzania, 1982, p. 92).

A household is a group of persons who
normally live and eat together. Although a
household is close to a family, the two
are not identical and there is no clear
relationship between the two. . . . A
household can only have one household
head and vice versa (Republic of Uganda,
1995, p. 5, emphasis in original).

For the purpose of the 2002
population and housing census a
"private household" was a group
of persons who lived together
and shared living expenses.
Usually these were a husband,
wife and children. Other relatives,
boarders, visitors and servants
were included as members of the
household if they were present
in the household on census night
(United Republic of Tanzania,
2003, p. 51)
de facto "for comparability"
(United Republic of Tanzania,
2003, p. 50)
questionnaire:
"please give the names of persons
who spent the census night in
your household starting with the
name of the head of household"
(United Republic of Tanzania,
2003, p. 77).
A household is a group of persons who
normally live and eat together.
Very often the household will be a family
living in the same house or compound and
eating together. A household will normally
consist of a man, his wife and children
and sometimes relatives and maids. The
following constitutes a household:
(i) A household may consist of one person
who lives and eats on his or her own.
(ii) A household may consist of several
persons who are not related to each
other. What matters is that they live
together in the same house or compound
and eat together.
(iii) If a man has two or more wives and
they and their children live and eat
together, they form one household. If
the wives and their children live and eat
separately, they will form more than one
household.
(iv) If two or more groups of persons, each
of which has its own separate eating and
housekeeping arrangements, live in the
same dwelling, treat them as separate
households (UBOS, 2001).
 En général un ménage
comprend un
homme, son épouse
ou ses épouses, ses
enfants non mariés,
d`autres parents et
domestiques non
mariés qui vivent
ensemble.

aAll footnotes are author translations: In theory, normal households are made up of a man married to one or more wives, the unmarried children from that union and, if
applicable, other unmarried children of earlier unions, ascendants, descendants, extended kin, and others.
bA compound consists of a hut or a group of huts or other sorts of dwelling delimited (or not) by a wall. The family nucleus is the smallest possible family unit. It is made up of
wives (or a wife) and their direct, unmarried descendants, that is to say parents and unmarried children. These people must live together in the same compound. By extension,
the same family nucleus can include the husband, several spouses, and their children provided they live in the same compound. Furthermore the same nucleus can include
direct ascendants (mother of the head of the family nucleus), brothers and sisters, and close unmarried kin (nephews, nieces, etc.) provided they live with the head of the family
nucleus and themselves have no unmarried children in the compound.
cThe basic socioeconomic unit in which different members, related or not, live together in the same house or compound, pool their resources, and jointly meet their needs for
food and other items of daily living. Some examples of households:
· Every married man, with his wife and unmarried children constitutes a separate household.
· Each child of a man, with his wife(ves) and children make up a separate household even if they cohabit in the same house or compound and jointly meet their needs for
food and other items of daily living.
· Any person, male or female, who lives alone and provides for himself or herself forms a separate household, and so on.
dThe household is the group of people, related or not, who live in the same compound, eat their daily meal together, and recognize the authority of a single person called the
household head. This concept is equivalent to "ndieul" in Wolof, "ngank" in Serer, and "hirande" in Toucouleur. If someone lives in the compound and eats with a household
in that compound, you should record him or her in that household. If he or she lives outside the compound but eats with a household, he or she should not be counted in that
household. Furthermore, if a person lives alone and eats alone, he or she should be recorded as a distinct single person household.
The compound is a group of buildings enclosed (or not) by a wall or fence . . . by residence we mean "usually living in a place for a certain length of time." For the 1988 census,
this place is the compound and the duration of residence is 6 months.
eThe basic socioeconomic unit in which members can be related or not. They live together in the same house or compound and jointly meet their needs for food and the
majority of other items of daily living. They usually recognize the authority of one of the household members who is the household head, whatever their sex.
NB: In compounds or houses occupied by parents and their married children, you must count the parents as a separate household from the household of their married
children: Each married child, his wife(ves), and unmarried children make up a different household. However, if just one parent depends on their married child, they belong to his
household.
fA group of people, related or not, who live together under the same roof and jointly or partly pool resources to meet their basic needs, notably housing and food. These
household members usually eat together and all recognize the authority of a single household head. In our national languages, the terms njël in Wolof, ngank in Serer, hirande in
Pulaar, and siitik in Joola are accurate translations of the concept of household.

on census night. A de jure census records individuals where
they normally live, even if they are absent on census night.
Some censuses combine both approaches.
2. Absent usual members were listed separately.
