Introduction
In this study, we examine post-treatment employment and
gross earnings outcomes of probationers participating in the
Maricopa County (Arizona), First Time Drug Offender
(FTDO), experimental drug court program that was tested
between 1992 and 1994 (Deschenes, Turner, & Greenwood,
1996). Using secondary data, we will be statistically analyz-
ing the main effects and interaction effects of criminal record
and substance use history indicators among probationers on
their post-treatment employment and gross earnings out-
comes at the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. The model
that we will be developing for predicting employment and
earnings outcomes among probationers controls for social-
demographic and psychosocial indicators.
The extant literature on the theoretical labeling of individu-
als with criminal records has demonstrated that entrenchment
in the criminal justice system has a bifurcated impact on
employment opportunities, particularly, for those individuals
who have experienced incarceration (Pager, 2005). The pri-
mary impact felt by those sentenced to jail or prison is their
relocation from their routine social and employment context in
the community to a highly regimented, supervised, and struc-
tured environment with limited or no economic opportunities
for inmates (Rose & Clear, 1998). The secondary impact can
be observed during the reentry phase, post-incarceration,
when the formerly incarcerated are attempting to resituate
themselves into the employment landscape from which they
have been suspended for varying periods of time. Frequently
discussed observations in the extant literature describe the
reentry phase as a form of extrajudicial punishment, where
the formerly incarcerated continue to be punished for their
criminal records by employers, in the competitive labor mar-
ket, who are searching for prospective hires with near flaw-
less credentials (Wacquant, 2009). Pager (2005) discusses
how criminal records serve as negative credentials that pre-
maturely signal to prospective employers that job applicants
may be unstable or unreliable, without further consideration
for the job applicants' skills, education, or employment his-
tory. The rate of unemployment among ex-offenders search-
ing for jobs that pay a living wage ranges from 25% to 40%
(Pager, 2005).

An Examination of Employment and
Earning Outcomes of Probationers With
Criminal and Substance Use Histories
Sriram Chintakrindi1, Jeremy Porter2, Chunrye Kim2,
and Suditi Gupta3
Abstract
There exists a strong relationship between having a criminal history and experiencing barriers to employment. Negative
credentials facilitate the social and economic exclusion of individuals with criminal records. However, previous research has
not concretely identified whether the stratification of economic opportunities by individual-level criminal records may be
further affecting those who demonstrate substance use histories. In this study, we examine the substance use and criminal
history profiles of probationers participating in an experimental drug treatment study and how probationer characteristics
affect employment outcomes and gross earnings at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. We hypothesize that
substance use and criminal history have a main effect and interactional relationship that reduces the odds of self-reporting
employment and decreases gross earnings outcomes of probationer. Our results demonstrate that substance use history and
criminal history has a main effect on employment and earnings outcomes.

Even more alarming, more than 700,000 inmates exit
prison annually, two thirds of whom reentering society hav-
ing histories of drug use (Friedmann et al., 2012). If drug
problems are left untreated or unmonitored, then this can
result in, with a high-likelihood, relapse or re-arrest of ex-
offenders. It is reported that drug use results in reincarcera-
tion of more than half of inmates within 3 years of their
release (Friedmann et al., 2012). Research conducted on
employment outcomes of college educated drug users dem-
onstrates that persistent drug users compared with non-drug
users have a higher likelihood of being unemployed (Arria
et al., 2013). Persistent drug users compared with non-drug
users were also found to have an increased likelihood of
being employed part-time versus full-time. These findings
on the relationship between drug use and employment are
even further exacerbated by criminal records as demon-
strated by Sung and Chu (2011) who found that offenders
who participated in substance use treatment interventions
experienced treatment schedules that conflicted with work
schedules, making employment difficult during the treat-
ment process. The researchers found that treatment length,
treatment compliance, and self-efficacy were strong predic-
tors of post-treatment employment (Sung & Chu, 2011).
Those offenders who completed treatment had increased
employment prospects compared with offenders who failed
to complete substance use treatment. Sung and Chu (2011)
discuss how both pro-social personality and law-abiding
behavioral characteristics are required to complete substance
use treatment and to obtain employment. More specifically,
offenders who demonstrate a strong sense of self-efficacy,
goal orientation, and motivation have increased odds of both
completing substance use treatment and gaining employed
when compared with offenders without those profile traits.
Although, Sung and Chu found that completing substance
use treatment improved employment prospects, however, it
did not improve personal incomes.
For this study, we are interested in examining post-
treatment employment and gross income outcomes for pro-
bationers. We hypothesize that probationers, who self-
reported having a criminal or substance use history, will
have a decrease in odds of reporting employment at the 6-
and 12-month follow-up periods compared with offenders
without criminal or substance use histories. In addition, we
hypothesize that probationers who reported having a crimi-
nal or substance use history, will have a statistically signifi-
cantly lower mean salary rate at the 6- and 12-month
follow-up periods compared with probationers without a
history of substance use. Finally, we hypothesize that sub-
stance use history moderates the relationship between
having a criminal history and post-treatment employment
and earnings outcomes. More specifically, the moderator
hypothesis states that offenders with a substance use history
will have a strengthened relationship between their criminal
history and decreased odds of employment and earnings
outcomes.
Literature Review
For the past four decades, there has been an exponential
growth in the population of inmates under the authority and
surveillance of the criminal justice system at both the state
and federal levels from 96 per 100,000 in 1970 to 501 per
100,000 in 2006 (Nagin, Cullen, & Jonson, 2009). In particu-
lar, African American communities that have historically
experienced high-rates of poverty and unemployment are
now routinely being targeted and blanketed by formal modes
of social control through the active presence of law-enforce-
ment and community-correctional supervision (Garland,
2001; Wacquant, 2009). Western and Wildeman (2009) state
that the one in seven Black men are entrenched in the crimi-
nal justice system by 2004. It is reported that a third of young
African American men, who were non-college educated,
were being incarcerated at the beginning of the 21st century
(Western & Wildeman, 2009). The enhanced surveillance
and authority of the criminal justice system in low-income
and minority communities has had socio-legal implications
that are pronounced, and difficult to mitigate and reverse
(Rose & Clear, 1998). Criminal justice offenders that have
passed through the corrections system are labeled criminal
and disenfranchised from the formal economy due to dis-
criminatory hiring practices by employers.
Employers with entry-level openings that pay a living
wage are typically risk-averse and have a surplus labor pool
to draw from to fill their employment needs. The disenfran-
chisement of the formerly incarcerated not only increases
their risk for recidivism, as the formerly incarcerated lack the
means to provide shelter and finances for supporting them-
selves, but unemployment and low-incomes has had a large
impact on the public safety and health of communities with
high concentrations of offenders. African American men liv-
ing in post-industrial communities with high unemployment
rates have limited education and job skills, thus making them
highly susceptible to engaging in the drug-trade and using
violence to resolve drug-related disputes (Western &
Wildeman, 2009). By engaging in the drug-trade, Black men
are not only engaging in criminal behavior, associated with
mandatory minimum sentences, for economic gain, but also
simultaneously proliferating addiction and the mental and
physical health problems associated with addiction into their
communities. Similarly, violence is now understood to not
only be a public safety issue for communities but is now also
being viewed as a significant public health disaster as emer-
gency rooms are flooded with an influx of victims of vio-
lence suffering from both physical wounds and trauma. The
homicide epidemic among economically disadvantaged
Black men between the ages of 18 and 25 are nearly 25 times
higher compared with White men between the ages of 25 and
above (Western & Wildeman, 2009).
The negative social and health effects of incarceration are
not only found among African American men, but results
from research demonstrate that experiencing incarceration
Chintakrindi et al. 3
increases the odds of premature adult mortality, particularly
among women, even when statistical controls for socio-
demographic characteristics, education, drug use, and ciga-
retteuseareapplied.Menwhohaveexperiencedincarceration
have an increased odds of premature adult mortality com-
pared with men who have not been incarcerated. Having a
lower level of education and being Black were found to
increase the odds of premature mortality (Massoglia, Pare,
Schnittker, & Gagnon, 2014).
The reentry phase for the formerly incarcerated, released
from prison or jail, presents numerous obstacles, which
include but are not limited to, explaining to employers about
gaps in employment, criminal records, and temporary resi-
dential addresses. The overwhelming presence of law
enforcement as the primary instrument for maintaining social
control of the formerly incarcerated, through the appendages
of community corrections, has been linked to exacerbating
the social disorganization, within communities with high
concentrations of offenders, through the active removal and
relocation of ex-offenders who violate their parole or proba-
tion mandates. Research illustrates that recidivism rates are
high among the formerly incarcerated. An estimated two
thirds of offenders released from prisoners are rearrested and
one-third are reincarcerated (Freeman, 2008). The revolving
doors of the criminal justice system diminishes or outright
eliminates offenders' capacity to assume multiple roles, such
as, being guardians and financial providers for their families
(Rose & Clear, 1998).
The displacement of offenders through the process of
removing and criminally labeling existing and potential
social capital and financial providers through differentially
enforced law-enforcement policies that have disproportion-
ately targeted communities with high concentrations of
African American and Hispanic young men has had a pro-
found impact on their employability and income outcomes
(Freeman, 2008; Golub, Johnson, & Dunlap, 2007;Wacquant,
2009). Contemporary criminal justice policy serves as an
instrument of actuarial management of offenders to not only
mitigate offender risk for recidivism but also enhance public
safety through intensive supervision and surveillance prac-
tices, rather than emphasizing rehabilitation or treat offend-
ers for their underlying criminogenic risk factors, thus
leaving offenders unprepared for the labor market and vul-
nerable to law-enforcement practices (Andrews & Bonta,
2010; Feeley & Simon, 1992; Packer, 1968; Tonry, 2004).
Unsuccessful reentry and reintegration of offenders
within their respective communities has been linked to the
inability to access employment training programs and to find
meaningful employment that provides living wages (Sung &
Chu, 2011). Finlay (2009) found that in states with open-
records policies where employers have access to criminal
history records over the Internet corresponded with lower
wages and earnings when compared with states that provide
closed-record policies and restorative rights for former
offenders. In addition to the structural barriers to entering the
labor market faced by those with criminal records, offenders
returning back to their communities, after a period of incar-
ceration, often lack employment and skills that correspond
with the volatile demands of the labor market.
However, the results remain mixed when examining the
effectiveness of community employment treatment programs
on reducing the risk of offender recidivism. Results from a
meta-analysis conducted by Visher, Winterfield, and
Coggeshall (2005) suggest that non-custodial community
employment programs do not reduce the odds of re-arrest
among ex-offenders. Furthermore, the researchers divided
the studies that they meta-analyzed into two groups, examin-
ing re-arrest rates among community employment program
participants based on whether they either had a prior convic-
tion or only a prior arrest. Similarly, they found that com-
munity employment programs did not reduce the odds of
recidivism for both groups (Visher et al., 2005).
Bushway and Apel (2012) report that at the national level,
35% of incarcerated inmates have a high school diploma
compared with 82% of the general population. Furthermore,
Bushway and Apel state that the formerly incarcerated dem-
onstrate characteristics that parallel other hard-to-employ
populations, such as welfare recipients and high school drop-
outs. The limited emphasis placed on the rehabilitation of
offenders through education and employment training within
the context of the criminal justice system has shaped the nar-
rative surrounding reentry of offenders and their recidivism
rates. Although routinely unsuccessful in reducing recidi-
vism, evidence-based employment programs provide valu-
able information on program participant demographics and
outcomes tied to substance use treatment, emerging public
health issues, and medical services utilization. In addition,
reentry employment programs have been viewed as an alter-
native and less invasive state-sanctioned social control for
supervising inmates post-incarceration.
In particular, Bushway and Apel (2012) discuss how a
longitudinal research study conducted in New Jersey over an
18-year period demonstrated that upwards of 25% of con-
victed felons desisted from offending during that time period.
However, most evaluations of employment training pro-
grams for the formerly incarcerated remain shortsighted and
examine recidivism rates within a 2-year pre and post-
treatment period, which is problematic because they are
unable to identify potential offenders who will desist for the
long term (Bushway & Apel, 2012). Therefore, according to
Bushway and Apel that desistance from future recidivism
either aided or unaided through employment programs
should be perceived as a signal that offenders have the capac-
ity to become law-abiding when given the opportunity and in
the absence of official state-sanctioned social controls, such
as probation or parole.
Researchers, stakeholders, and criminal justice policy
makers continue to examine and promote interventions that
facilitate reductions in recidivism and yield high-quality data
that allow for the indirect surveillance of economic and
4 SAGE Open
public health outcomes, associated with offenders, for the
purposes of informing public policy (Bushway & Apel,
2012). Other scholars suggest that reductions in recidivism
can be achieved by leveraging the authority of the criminal
justice system to pressure offenders post-incarceration into
aftercare rehabilitation oriented programs, such as substance
use treatment, mental health treatment, employment readi-
ness, and job placement programs (Chintakrindi, Porter,
Mellow, & Sung, 2015; Chintakrindi, Upton, Louison, Case,
& Steadman, 2013; Friedmann et al., 2012; Sung & Belenko,
2005).
Pager (2005) provides an applied theoretical framework
for understanding how the labeling process is facilitated for
the disenfranchisement of offenders from the formal economy,
through the institutionalized administration and bureaucratic
management of negative credentials, thus stratifying offenders
and non-offenders in the competitive labor market. Sung and
Belenko (2005) found that offenders participating in the Drug
Treatment Alternative to Prison (DTAP) program who were
unemployed had a higher likelihood of arrest compared with
those who were employed. More specifically, 45% of those
who indicated that they were unemployed were rearrested at
the 5-year follow-up period compared with 28% of those who
indicated employment while participating in DTAP. The
researchers hypothesize that the lower odds of arrest among
the employed ex-offenders may perhaps be attributed to the
imposition of discipline, generation of income, and increased
self-esteem associated with a pro-social identity that is facili-
tated by having stable employment.
Employers advertising entry-level positions with livable
wages demand higher education, optimal physical and men-
tal health, above-satisfactory credit histories, and no criminal
records. The research conducted by Pager (2005) illustrates
how the interaction of race and criminal history in the con-
texts of searching for employment, for the formerly incarcer-
ated,isaformof"doublejeopardy."Theformerlyincarcerated
and those with criminal histories continue to be punished long
after having served their sentences, where they face discrimi-
nation for not only their criminal records, but research dem-
onstrates that their race may also factor into employability
(Pager, 2005). From an experiment conducted by Pager on the
callback rates from employers for employees seeking jobs,
descriptive statistics illustrate that White individuals with
criminal records (17%) had slightly higher callback rates
compared with Blacks without criminal records (14%).
Along with race and criminal history, substance use his-
tory appears to be a significant detriment to employability.
However, previous research has not concretely identified
which factor has the strongest main effect on ex-offenders
seeking employment. Pager (2003) reviews how incarceration
history alone does not fully explain poor post-incarceration
employment outcomes among offenders. In fact, the relation-
ship between incarceration history and employment out-
comes may be spurious. Instead, Pager illustrates that
pre-existing characteristics of offenders, such as substance
use dependence, behavioral problems, and poor interper-
sonal skills have been found to be robust predictors of both
recidivism and poor-employment outcomes when compared
with the effects of incarceration history alone.
An examination of treatment outcomes from a study on
drug court participants revealed that participants who
reported having employment at intake increased their odds
of completing of drug court (Roll, Prendergast, Richardson,
& Ramirez, 2005), whereas, participants who reported hav-
ing a history of injection drug use were less likely to com-
plete drug court. Roll et al. (2005) speculates that indicators
of employment and injection drug use history are proxies for
measuring the severity of participants' substance use disor-
ders while being under the supervision of drug court.
Furthermore, the researchers speculate that individuals who
are able to maintain employment are not as impaired as those
participants without employment and also have less severe
histories of substance use disorders and better prognosis for
recovery.
Similarly, research on employment and work outcomes
among drug court participants conducted by Leukefeld,
Webster, Staton-Tindall, and Duvall (2007) demonstrates that
participants who received an employment/skills training inter-
vention, while mandated to drug court, reported decreased
drug use and recidivism compared with the treatment as usual
control group in the study. More specifically, increased dosage
and exposure to the employment intervention was associated
with decreased self-reported substance use and criminality
among the drug court clients. Although findings from both the
Roll et al. (2005) and Leukefeld et al. demonstrate a promising
relationship between being employed, receiving employment
training, and decreased substance use and criminality, there
still remains a gap in knowledge regarding the extent to which
having a substance use history affects the relationship between
criminal history and post-treatment employment and gross
income outcomes.
Summary of the MaricopaCounty FTDO Program
Data for this study were taken from the Arizona,
MaricopaCounty, FTDO Program. This study is a secondary
data analysis of the FTDO program participants'earnings and
employment outcomes. The researchers who collected the
data for the FTDO study were concerned with measuring the
drug usage and recidivism outcomes of probationers
(Deschenes et al., 1996). Participants in the program were ran-
domly assigned to either standard probation with varying drug
testing and probation supervision schedules in the control
group or they were assigned to drug court and intensive drug
treatment, which was the experimental group, for a 12-month
period. The method for randomly assigning research partici-
pants into the control and experimental groups was managed
by a computer program (Deschenes et al., 1996).
Within the control group, probationers were randomly
assigned to three different tracks which differed in their
Chintakrindi et al. 5
frequency of urine-analysis testing and probation supervision
dosage. All three tracks were assigned probation supervision
with varying schedules of supervision dosage. Probationers in
Track 1 did not receive any urine-analysis testing and the fre-
quency of visits with the probation officers were determined
by both scores from a risk and needs assessment. Probationers
in Track 2 received low-frequency urine-analysis testing once
a month and visited once bimonthly with a probation officer.
Probationers in Track 3 received high-frequency urine-analy-
sis testing biweekly and visited with the probation officer
once bimonthly (Deschenes & Greenwood, 1994).
The intensive treatment program, for the experimental
group, in Track 4, emphasized a biopsychosocial treatment
model that sought to treat the whole individual, rather than
focus solely on drug use. An assumption of the biopsychoso-
cial treatment model is that drug use is a symptom of other
problems that may include but is not limited to poor coping
skills related to family dysfunction, anxiety, self-esteem,
anger, or codependency (Deschenes & Greenwood, 1994).
Offenders in the experimental group received the treatment
intervention in three phases, each of which lasted 2 months.
The first phase, the orientation, provided weekly drug edu-
cation, social skills training, and a 12-step meeting focused
on providing drug education and relapse prevention. The
second phase, known as stabilization, focused primarily on
relapse prevention. The third and final phase, known as tran-
sition, required probationers to attend one process group
meeting and one 12-step meeting once a week. The treatment
protocol and underlying theory guiding the experimental
intervention has been exhaustively detailed by Deschenes
and Greenwood (1994).
Research participants in the experimental group, Track 4,
received probation supervision through a drug court program
that included random urine-analysis testing, probation super-
vision, and intensive outpatient drug treatment that included
counseling, drug treatment, relapse prevention, social skills
training, and group therapy. The drug court, provided offend-
ers with a contract, outlining expectations and the structure
of the program. The judge in the program explained to the
offenders how rewards and punishments are associated with
urine-analysis outcomes. Probationers, who consistently had
negative urine-analysis outcomes, indicating no drug use,
received reduced jail time and probation sentences. For pro-
bationers with positive urine-analysis outcomes, indicating
drug use, the judge had the option of ordering probationers to
repeat phases of treatment, more drug testing, or jail time
(Deschenes & Greenwood, 1994).
Research Questions
Our study seeks to understand the main effects of substance
use and criminal history on post-treatment employment and
income outcomes among probationers participating in the
Maricopa County, Arizona, Experimental Drug Treatment
Study at the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods (Deschenes
& Greenwood, 1994). This study is interested in examining
the moderating effect that having a substance use history has
on the relationship between criminal history and employ-
ment outcomes at the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.
Moreover, this study is interested in examining the moderat-
ing effect that having a substance use history has on the rela-
tionship between criminal history and income outcomes at
the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.
Hypotheses
In this study, we hypothesize that probationers with sub-
stance use histories have an increased odds of reporting
unemployment at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up peri-
ods. Moreover, we hypothesize that probationers with crimi-
nal histories have an increased likelihood of reporting
unemployment at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up peri-
ods. We hypothesize that having a substance use history has
a moderating effect on the relationship between having a
criminal history and decreased odds of unemployment at
both the 6- and 12-month follow-up period. More specifi-
cally, we hypothesize that probationers reporting a substance
use history will strengthen the relationship between having a
criminal history and decreased odds of unemployment at
both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.
Similarly, we hypothesize that probationers with sub-
stance use histories compared with those without substance
use histories have decreased gross incomes at both the 6- and
12-month follow-up periods. Moreover, we hypothesize that
probationers with criminal histories compared with those
without criminal histories have decreased gross incomes at
the follow-up periods. We hypothesize that having a sub-
stance use history has a moderating effect on the relationship
between having a criminal history and decreased gross
income outcomes at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up peri-
ods. More specifically, we hypothesize that reporting a sub-
stance use history will strengthen the relationship between
having a criminal history and decreased gross income out-
comes at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.
Method
Data
For this study, we conducted a secondary data analysis of the
Maricopa County, Arizona, adult probation experimental
drug testing program data, which was collected between the
years 1992 and 1994 (Deschenes et al., 1996). These data
were accessed using the Interuniversity Consortium for
Political and Social Research (ICPSR) website.
Sample
Probationers in this study were sentenced between 1992 and
1993. The probationers agreed to participate in the Maricopa
6 SAGE Open
County Adult Probation Department (Arizona) drug court
experiment. The Maricopa County FTDO program is a post-
adjudication drug treatment program for offenders sentenced
to probation for a felony drug offense (Deschenes et al.,
1996). Offenders who were eligible for the FTDO program
had first time convictions for possession of marijuana, dan-
gerous drugs, narcotics, or drug paraphernalia (Deschenes &
Greenwood, 1994). Offenders convicted of drug sales or traf-
ficking were not eligible to participate in the research study.
Measures
In this study, we use a retrospective case­control design, in
which employment and earnings among probationers
were compared in terms of their expression by social-
demographic, psychosocial, and criminal and substance use
history characteristics. The measures we will use for our
final multivariate models were specified based on the extant
literature discussed in the literature review and through iden-
tifying statistically significant indicators during our bivariate
analyses.
Outcome variables.In this study, we will examine both
employment and gross earnings outcomes among probation-
ers, which include the employment status and gross earnings
of probationers at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up peri-
ods. We dichotomously coded the employment status (0 =
unemployed or had part-time/full-time employment = 1) at
both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. The gross earn-
ings variable is a continuously coded, ratio level, measure
that is used to measure monetary earnings at both the 6- and
12-month follow-up period.
Predictor variables. For this study, we will be controlling for
seven items that are indicators of the social-demographic
background characteristics among the probationers. The
study track variable was originally coded as the control
group (Tracks 1-3) and treatment group (Track 4). The study
track variable in this study will be recoded into a discrete
dichotomously coded variable that will be operationalized as
1 = treatment group and 0 = control group. The demographic
data that will be used in this study include the age of the
offender entering the research study, gender of the offender
(1 = male or 0 = female), race (1 = non-White or 0 = White),
education level of offender (1 = high graduate or 0 = not high
school graduate), relationship status (1 = has relationship or
0 = single), and living status (1 = living alone or 0 = living
with at least one person).
We will be controlling for six items that are indicators of
psychosocial characteristics. The psychosocial variables that
we will use in this study include data on the attitudes toward
complying with the law (1 = not motivated to change, ratio-
nalizes behavior or 0 = motivated or somewhat motivated to
change), marital and family relationships (1 = some or major
family dysfunction or 0 = exceptionally or relatively stable
family functioning), peer associations (1 = has occasional or
completely negative relationships or 0 = good or no negative
relationships), physical health (1 = some or severe health
dysfunction or 0 = sound health), emotional stability (1 =
some or severe limits to emotional functioning or 0 = excep-
tionally or appropriately adjusted), and probation officer
assessment of probationer needs (1 = probation officer
assessment indicates moderate or high needs or 0 = probation
officer assessment indicates well-adjusted or no needs). The
psychosocial variables were originally coded using multiple
indicators. We collapsed the indicators into dichotomously
coded binary categories.
We will be examining seven items that are indicators of
criminal history. The variables we will include in this study
will be dichotomously coded variables including the number
of prior arrests (1 = one or more prior arrests or 0 = no prior
arrests), number of prior misdemeanor convictions (one or
more prior misdemeanor convictions or 0 = no prior misde-
meanor convictions), number of prior felony convictions
(one or more prior felony convictions or 0 = no prior felony
convictions), prior jail history (1 = yes has been to jail or 0 =
no has never been to jail), prior prison history (1 = yes has
been to prison or 0 = no has never been to prison), employed
prior to arrest (1 = yes employed prior to arrest or 0 = not
employed prior to arrest), and history of drug dealing (1 =
yes has dealt drugs or 0 = no has not dealt drugs).
We will be examining nine items that are indicators of
substance use history. We will be dichotomously coding each
of the specific drug use indicators (1 = used substance and 0
= did not use substance). We will create an aggregate mea-
sure using the data from the individual substance use history
variables to measure history of any drug use (1 = yes has
history of any drug use or 0 = no does not have history of any
drug use). In addition, we will measure substance use treat-
ment prior to arrest using a dichotomously coded indicator
(1 = yes has previously been enrolled in substance use treat-
ment or 0 = no has not been previously enrolled in substance
use treatment). Finally, we will use a dichotomously coded
indicator of whether probations were enrolled in substance
use treatment at the time of their arrest (1 = yes enrolled in
substance use treatment or 0 = no not enrolled in substance
use treatment).
Plan of Analysis
For this study, we begin by providing descriptive statistics
using percentages and means for the outcome variables at the
6- and 12-month follow-up periods. Moreover, we will pres-
ent descriptive statistics for the predictor variables: demo-
graphic characteristics, treatment condition, criminal history,
and substance use history. Next, we will be conducting bivar-
iate statistical analysis of the employment and gross earnings
outcomes with predictor variables for the purpose of identi-
fying marginally or statistically significant relationships with
an alpha value of less than .10. The employment outcome
Chintakrindi et al. 7
variable measured at the follow-up periods is discrete and
dichotomously coded. Therefore, we will use a chi-square test
to examine the relationship between employment outcomes
and predictor variables. Using an independent sample t test,
we will examine the relationship between gross earnings and
predictor variables. For continuously coded predictor vari-
ables, we will use a Pearson's r correlational test for examin-
ing their relationship to gross earnings. This will allow us to
identify the magnitude and direction of marginally or statisti-
cally significant relationships between predictor and outcome
variables with an alpha value of less than .10.
Finally, we will identify predictor variables that were
found to be theoretically important in the extant literature
and statistically or marginally significantly during our
exploratory bivariate analyses. These predictor variables will
then be used to specify our hierarchical logistic regression
and hierarchical multiple regression models for predicting
earnings and employment outcomes. Hierarchical regression
is used when there is a lack of independence across levels of
clustered data. Sung and Richter (2006) report that the hier-
archical regression technique can control for temporal and
spatial clustering of data when testing predictive models
using data with similar background characteristics. A lack of
independence across levels of clustered data can result in
incorrect point estimates, confidence intervals, standard
errors, and p values, which are threats to both internal and
external validity (Sung & Richter, 2006). We are attempting
to determine which criminal history and substance use his-
tory variables are robust for predicting employment out-
comes for probationers when controlling for background and
psychosocial characteristics.
The output that will be reported and interpreted for the
logistic regression analysis includes the -2 log likelihood for
the fully reduced model and the related 2 for the full model
and related significance levels to determine whether input-
ting independent variables improves the model fitness. The
results that are reported and interpreted include the odds
ratios and significance levels for each predictor variable. The
output that will be reported and interpreted for the multiple
regression analysis include the R2, F-value, model signifi-
cance, unstandardized regression coefficients, and signifi-
cance of coefficients.
We hypothesize that indication of a prior criminal history
separately predicts a decrease in employment and earnings
outcomes at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.
The moderator hypothesis is that substance use will
strengthen the relationship between criminal history and
employment and earnings outcomes. The model diagrammed
in Figure 1 has three causal paths that affect the post-treat-
ment employment and earnings outcomes. Path A examines
the main effect of the predictor, substance use history, on
post-treatment employment and earnings outcomes. Path B
examines the "impact of controllability as a moderator"
(Baron & Kenny, 1986). The moderator in Path B for this
study is substance use history. Path C examines whether
there is a significant interaction between criminal history and
substance use history when separately predicting both
employment and earnings outcomes.
If a significant interaction effect is observed, then we can
interpret our observation as a moderation effect. However, to
determine whether our moderator hypothesis is supported, it
is necessary to interpret the magnitude and direction of the
interaction effect. Baron and Kenny (1986) report that there
may be significant main effects for both the predictor and
moderator; however, the main effects are not conceptually
relevant to testing the moderator hypothesis. Baron and
Kenny also report that the moderator variable should be
uncorrelated to both the predictor and outcome variable to
clearly interpret the interaction term between the predictor
and moderator (Path C). Moderators and predictors are both
considered exogenous variables and are always considered
independent variables that are causally antecedent to the out-
come variable (Baron & Kenny, 1986).
The moderator hypothesis for our research question is
tested by computing an interaction term between the predic-
tor variable (criminal history) and the moderating variable
(substance use history). To avoid issues with multi-collinearity,
the criminal history for each case was centered by subtracting
the overall mean from each individual case for the criminal
history variable. Next, an interaction was computed between
the centered criminal history and the substance use history
by multiplying the two variables. Finally, both of the main
effects, the interaction term and control variables, will be
entered into the model to predict the employment and earn-
ings outcome variables.
Missing Data
For this study, we highlight the percentage of missing data in
our descriptive statistics. Among predictor variables the per-
centage of missing data ranged from 0% to 10.4% missing.
For predictor variables, we observed a relatively low per-
centage of missing data, especially when compared with
missing data among our earnings and employment outcome
variables for this study. Among the outcome variables, we
observed that the percentage of missing data ranging from
53% to 70% of outcome data recorded at the 6- and 12-month
follow-up periods. For this study, we listwise deleted cases

with missing predictor or outcome variable data. We did not
attempt to impute missing outcome variable data because
Wood, White, and Thompson (2004) discuss that when a
large percentage of outcome data is imputed this can lead to
bias in statistical interpretation, particularly if it is missing
data for outcome variables.
Given the large percentage of missing outcome data and
an analysis of missing data using the Missing Value Analysis
module in IBM SPSS v.22, we find that our data is missing
completely at random and is unrelated to baseline covariates.
Porter and Ecklund (2012) provide an extensive discussion
on "active nonresponders" which are described as research
participants that complete a portion of the study but refuse to
or are unable to complete the rest of the survey for individ-
ual-level reasons. Porter and Ecklund found that when ask-
ing research participants controversial research questions
regarding personal or stigmatizing information, they were
less likely to respond to those questions. Porter and Ecklund
specifically state,
We link their data patterns to family formation, religious
socialization, and present religiousity . . . traditional statistics do
not always help us understand the reasons behind missing data
and low survey-response rates. (pp. 450-451)
Results
The results that we will be presenting in this section are sepa-
rated into three parts. We will begin with the descriptive sta-
tisticsbysummarizingthesocial-demographicscharacteristics
of the probationers in the sample and their employment and
earnings outcomes. In the second part of the results section,
we will provide the results from the bivariate analysis using
the chi-square test and independent samples t test for examin-
ing the relationship between control, predictor, and outcome
variables. In the third and final part of the results section, we
will be presenting a series of output for logistic and multiple
regression analyses where we are predicting employment and
earnings outcomes measured at both the 6- and 12-month
follow-up periods. Our moderator hypothesis will be tested
using indicators of criminal history and substance use history
by examining their main effects and interactional effects on
the outcome variables. Marginally or statistically significant
relationships will be reported and interpreted.
Descriptive Statistics
Using study data, in Table 1, we observe that there are 630
probationers with 27.9% (n = 176) randomized to the treat-
ment group and 72.1% (n = 454) in the control group. The
mean age of the probationers was 28.9 ± 7.6 years. The gen-
der distribution is 22.1% (n = 139) women and 77.9% (n =
491) men. The race distribution is 53.7% (n = 338) White and
46.3% (n = 292) non-White. The distribution of relationship
status is 17.5 % (n = 110) married or in a relationship and
82.4% (n = 519) are single or divorced. The distribution of
living status is 8.6% (n = 54) living alone and 87.1% (n =
549) living with at least one other person. The education dis-
tribution is 50.0% (n = 315) with a high school education or
higher and 49.4% (n = 311) with less than a high school
education.
Using study data in Table 1, we observe that at the 6-month
follow-up, 85.9% (n = 255) indicated having either part-time
or full-time employment. Moreover, we observe that 14.1%
(n = 42) of probationers indicated having no employment at
the 6-month follow-up. At the 12-month follow-up, we
observe that 78.9% (n = 176) of probationers indicated hav-
ing either part-time or full-time employment. Moreover, we
observe that 21.1% (n = 47) of probationers indicated having
no employment at the 12-month follow-up. In Table 1, we
observe that at the 6-month follow-up, the mean gross earn-
ings is US$803.40 ± US$579.74 (n = 284). We observe that
at the 12-month follow-up, the mean gross earnings is
US$796.37 ± US$613.37 (n = 191). To put these descriptive
findings into context, the U.S. Census Bureau (2015) reports
that in 1994, the income poverty threshold, for a household
of two persons with zero children, who are both under the
age of 65, is US$9,924.00. Based on our estimations, if our
probationers were reporting monthly gross earnings, on aver-
age, of US$796.37 over a 12-month period, they would have
earned US$9,556.44, which is below the poverty threshold
for 1994 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015).
Bivariate Analysis Results
Chi-square test results. The chi-square test results (Table A1
in the appendix) reveal that there are a few marginally sig-
nificant relationships between indicators of background
characteristics and employment outcomes. More specifi-
cally, we observe that at the 6-month follow-up that there is
a marginally significant relationship between living status
and employment outcomes (p< .10). At the 12-month follow-
up, we observe that the treatment condition is marginally sig-
nificantly related to employment outcomes (p< .10).
However, using the chi-square test, we did not observe any
statistically or marginally significant relationships between
psychosocial indicators and employment outcomes at both
the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods (Table A1 in the
appendix).
The chi-square test results (Table A2 in the appendix)
reveal that there are a few marginally or statistically signifi-
cant relationships between indicators of criminal history and
employment. The indicator for prior arrests is statistically
significantly related to employment outcomes at the 6-month
follow-up period (p<.05). The indicator for having employ-
ment prior to arrest is statistically significantly related to
employment outcomes at the 6-month follow-up (p< .01).
The indicator for prior felony convictions is statistically sig-
nificantly related to employment outcomes at the 12-month
follow-up (p< .05). The indicator for previous jail time is
Chintakrindi et al. 9
statistically significantly related to employment outcomes at
12-month follow-up (p< .05). The indicator for engaging in
drug sales is marginally significantly related to employment
outcomes at the 12-month follow (p< .10).
The chi-square test results (Table A2 in the appendix)
reveal that there are a few statistically significant relation-
ships between indicators of substance use history and
employment outcomes. More specifically, we observed that
the indicator of having a history of using uppers (e.g., stimu-
lants) is significantly related to employment outcomes at the
6-month follow-up (p< .05). At the 12-month follow-up, we
observe that there is a statistically significant relationship
between having a history of any drug use and employment
outcomes at the 12-month follow-up (p<.05).
Independent sample t-test results.In this section, we will
examine results from the independent samples t-test analysis
of differences in mean gross earnings using predictor and
control variables (Table A3 in the appendix). We will begin
by analyzing mean differences in gross earnings by socio-
demographic characteristics. At the 6-month follow-up, we
observe that probationers who are married (M = 1,055.06,

earnings mean compared with probationers who are not mar-
ried (M = 754.14, SD = 548.82), t(279) = -1.55, p< .01. At
the 6-month follow-up, we observe that probationers who are
living alone (M = 1,158.59, SD = 912.10) have a statistically
significant higher gross earnings mean compared with pro-
bationers who are living with at least one person or more
(M = 769.50, SD = 523.44), t(278) = -3.365, p<.01.
At the 12-month follow-up, we observe that probationers
who are racially White (M = 872.50, SD = 655.56) have a
statistically significant higher gross earnings mean com-
pared with probationers who are racially non-White (M =
686.06, SD = 531.42), t(189) = -2.083, p< .05. At the
12-month follow-up, we observe that probationers who are
married (M = 972.126, SD = 531.42) have a marginally sig-
nificantly higher gross earnings mean compared with proba-
tioners who are not married (M = 754.14, SD = 608.72),
t(189) = -1.955, p< .10. At the 12-month follow-up, we
observe that probationers who have an education of a high
school education or higher (M = 854.15, SD = 644.56) have
a marginally significantly higher gross earnings mean com-
pared with probationers who have less than a high school
degree (M = 684.40, SD = 537.67), t(188) = -1.858, p< .10.
Our analysis of gross earnings mean differences by psy-
chosocial characteristics did not reveal any statistically sig-
nificant results at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.
However, we did find that at the 12-month follow-up that pro-
bationers who indicated being exceptionally or appropriately
emotionally adjusted (M = 958.88, SD = 892.88) have a mar-
ginally significantly higher mean gross earnings compared
with probationers who indicated having some or severe limits
to emotional functions (M = 760.97, SD = 534.73), t(184) =
-1.698, p< .10 (Table A3 in the appendix).
Our analysis of mean gross earnings differences by crimi-
nal history indicators yields statistically significant results at
both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods (Table A4 in the
appendix). More specifically, at the 6-month follow-up, we
found that probationers who were employed prior to arrest
(M = 869.80, SD = 590.13) have a statistically significantly
higher mean gross earnings compared with probationers
who were not employed prior to arrest (M = 575.15, SD =
446.81), t(276) = -3.593, p< .01. At the 12-month follow-up,
we found that probationers who have no prior history of
going to jail (M = 886.50, SD = 645.59) have a statistically
significantly higher mean gross earnings compared with pro-
bationers who have a history of going to jail (M = 672.05,
SD = 560.21), t(178) = 2.243, p< .05. At the 12-month fol-
low-up, we found that probationers who were employed
prior to arrest (M = 859.57, SD = 632.99) have a statistically
significantly higher mean gross earnings compared with pro-
bationers who were not employed prior to arrest (M = 595.61,
SD = 467.68), t(184) = -2.556, p< .05. At the 12-month fol-
low-up, we found that probationers who have no prior mis-
demeanor convictions (M = 907.89, SD = 727.23) have a
marginally significantly higher mean gross earnings com-
pared with probationers who have prior misdemeanor con-
victions (M = 729.29, SD = 529.14), t(188) = 1.951, p< .10.
Our analysis of gross earnings mean differences by sub-
stance use history did not reveal any statistically significant
results at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods (Table
A4 in the appendix). However, we did find that at the 6-month
follow-up that probationers who indicated using uppers, such
as, stimulants (M = 688.21, SD = 479.16), have a marginally
significantly lower mean gross earnings compared with pro-
bationers who indicated never having used uppers (M =
833.62, SD = 594.96), t(280) = 1.792, p< .10.
Logistic and Multiple Regression Analysis Results
Based on previously conceptualized models from the theoreti-
cal and empirical literature and also using our bivariate analy-
sis results to guide our model specification, we will use a
model structure that tests outcome for employment and earn-
ings using the following constructs: social-demographic char-
acteristics, psychosocial characteristics, criminal history, and
substance use history to predict post-treatment employment
and earnings outcomes. Our specification of our theoretical
constructs for criminal history is the product of identifying
three separate items that are representative of criminal history
in the extant literature. In our final model, we use the follow-
ing indicators for criminal history: prior arrests, previous jail
commitments, and employment prior to arrest. For represent-
ing an overarching construct of substance use history, we use
any history of illegal substance use and history of using uppers.
Both substance use history indicators were found to be statisti-
cally significant in our bivariate analysis.
Logistic regression analysis for predicting employment status at
the 6- and 12-month follow-up. We observe a statistically sig-
nificant model for predicting employment outcomes at the
6-month follow-up when all of the control and predictor vari-
ables are inputted into the final model (Model 5) using hier-
archical logistic regression (p< .05). In Table 2, we observe
that probationers who indicated having one or more prior
arrests decreased their odds of gaining employment by 0.133
times at the 6-month follow-up compared with probationers
who did not have prior arrests (p< .05). Probationers who
were employed prior to their arrest increased their odds of
gaining employment at the 6-month follow-up by 2.971 times
compared with probationers who were not employed prior to
arrest (p< .05). Probationers who indicated having used
uppers at least one time had decreased their odds of gaining
employment by 0.405 times at the 6-month follow-up com-
pared with probationers who never tried uppers (p< .10). We
found no significant interaction to support our moderation
hypothesis. The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 demonstrates that our
final model explains a moderate 20% of the variation in the
employment outcome at the 6-month follow-up.
In Table 3, we observe a statistically significant model for
predicting employment outcomes at the 12-month follow-up
Chintakrindi et al. 11
when all of the control and predictor variables are inputted into
the third model using hierarchical logistic regression (p< .05).
We will be interpreting the findings from Model 3. We observe
that probationers who indicated being assigned to the treatment
group increased their odds of gaining employment by 3.411
times at the 12-month follow-up compared with probationers
who were assigned to the control group (p< .05). Probationers
who indicated some or severe health dysfunction had decreased
their odds of employment by 0.377 times compared with proba-
tioners with good health at the 12-month follow-up (p< .10).
Probationers who indicated having previously been to jail had
decreased their odds of employment by 0.324 times compared
with probationers with no jail history at the 12-month follow-up
(p< .05).We found no significant interaction to support our mod-
eration hypothesis. The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 demonstrates that
our third model explains a moderate 19% of the variation in the
employment outcome at the 12-month follow-up. The subse-
quent Models 4 and 5 were only marginally significant (p< .10).
Adding the substance use history and interaction variables into
the final model did not statistically significantly improve the
final models predictability of employment outcomes.
Multiple regression analysis for predicting gross earnings at the
6- and 12-month follow-up. We observe a statistically significant
model for predicting gross earnings outcomes at the 6-month
follow-up when including all of the predictor and control vari-
ables into the final model (p< .01). In Table 4, we observe a
statistically significant finding that probationers who live alone
make 367.33 dollars more than probationers living with one or
more individuals (p< .01). We observe a marginally significant
finding that probationers with negative relationships make
136.19 dollars less than probationers with positive relation-
ships (p< .10). We observe a marginally significant finding that
probationers who have moderate or high needs make 261.36
dollars more than probationers with little or no needs (p< .10).
We observe a statistically significant finding that those proba-
tioners who have employment prior to their arrest make 283.98
dollars more than those probationers with no employment prior
to their arrest (p< .01). We observe the marginally significant
finding that those probationers who indicated using uppers at
least one time make 201.20 dollars less than those probation-
ers who have never tried uppers (p< .10). We found no signifi-
cant interaction to support our moderation hypothesis. The R2
for our final model indicates that our predictors explain a
moderate 13% of the variance in the earnings outcome vari-
able at the 6-month follow-up.
We observe a statistically significant model for predicting
gross earnings outcomes at the 12-month follow-up when

including all of the predictor and control variables into the

We observe a statistically significant finding that probation-
ers who indicate experiencing health dysfunction make

probationers who indicate having been previously to jail
make 231.99 dollars less than probationers who have not

tion to support our moderation hypothesis. The R2 for our
final model indicates that our predictors explain a moderate
17% of the variance in the earnings outcome variable at the

Conclusion
Discussion
Findings from our analysis demonstrate that probationers'
employment and earnings outcomes are moderately and neg-
atively affected by having criminal and substance use histo-
ries. We found that both criminal and substance use histories
have main effects on employment and earnings outcomes at
the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. However, we did not
find empirical evidence to support our moderation hypothe-
sis that indicators of substance use will strengthen the rela-
tionship between indicators of criminal history and
unemployment onlow gross earnings outcomes. We did not
find any significant statistical interactions between criminal
history and substance use indicators.
In our models, we controlled for theoretical and empirical
correlates of employment and earnings outcomes using socio-
demographic and psychosocial indicators. When examining
employment outcomes at the 12-month follow-up, we observed
that probationers assigned to the treatment group had increased
odds of being employed compared with probationers assigned
to the control group. This finding is important because it

provides empirical support for intensive drug treatment
interventions that are leveraged by the criminal justice sys-
tem and their ability to produce numerous pro-social out-
comes that go beyond the standard goals of reducing drug
use and recidivism (Andrews & Bonta, 2010; Deschenes &
Greenwood, 1994; Friedmann et al., 2012). Andrews and
Bonta (2010) provide a strong and substantial theoretical
framework for reducing offender recidivism by identifying
and treating criminogenic risk factors through their Risk-
Needs-Responsivity model.
Interestingly, at the 12-month follow-up, when examining the
gross earnings of probationers, we observe that education status
is a significant predictor of gross earnings. Probationers with a
high school diploma or greater are predicted to make 200 dollars
more than probationers without a high school education. This
finding replicates the previous empirical literature that demon-
strates the pro-social and economic advantages of increased edu-
cation on employment and earnings outcomes for offenders
(Adams et al., 1994; Makarios, Steiner, & Travis, 2010).
When examining employment outcomes, we controlled
for psychosocial indicators and found that those indicators
were not significantly predictive of employment at both the
6- and 12-month follow-up periods. However, when examin-
ing gross earnings outcomes, we did find that reporting hav-
ing negative peer-relationships and poor health were
predictive of decreased earnings at the 12-month follow-up.
These findings are important and problematic for our study.
They are important because they highlight that psychosocial
indicators are important empirical correlates of socio-
economic performance, particularly for predicting gross
earnings. However, these findings are problematic because
they are not a consistent set of indicators across our analysis
of both earnings and employment outcomes. Therefore, we
are unable to definitively conclude whether our psychosocial
indicators may have a deeper and more meaningful signifi-
cance for explaining substance use history, criminal history,
employment outcomes, and earnings outcomes.
It is possible that there is a latent or unobservable behav-
ioral, cognitive, or personality construct that may serve to min-
imize spurious relationships between both our predictor and
outcome variables in this study. Future studies of employment
and earnings outcomes among offenders should consider mea-
suring the dimensionality of low self-control or social learning
and its effects on offending and analogous behaviors (Akers,
1997; M. R. Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990). Although research
demonstrates substance use and criminal history are viewed by
employers as negative credentials and barriers to employment,
our primary concern is that substance use and criminal history
may be symptomatic of deeper psychopathological disposi-
tions among offenders (Pager, 2003, 2005).
When examining the relationship between indicators of
criminal history and employment outcomes in our study, we
found that having one or more priors arrests significantly
decreased the odds of having employment at the 6-month

follow-up. Similarly, we found that having a history of hav-
ing been to jail significantly decreased the odds of employ-
ment at the 12-month follow-up. Although we did not
observe our indicators being consistently significant across
our models, we do have strong empirical evidence to suggest
that criminal history indicators have a main effect on odds of
employment. When including commonly controlled for con-
textual factors into our model, such as, race and education
level, our findings remain significant and robust. This find-
ing is important because it demonstrates that employability
among probationers is significantly reduced by repeated con-
tact with the criminal justice system. Our findings support
Pager's (2003) hypothesis that criminal records serve as
negative credentials by signaling to employers that the pro-
spective employee is unreliable and a potential liability.
Limitations
The primary limitation for our study is related to missing data.
The amount of missing data in this study may be resulting in
Type II errors, where we are failing to reject the null hypoth-
esis as a result of unreliable and small coefficient estimates.
We acknowledge that missing data are problematic in our
study; nevertheless, we observe that indicators of criminal
history and substance use are marginally and statistically sig-
nificant predictors of employment and earnings outcomes in a
number of our models. We do not believe that data imputation
would be appropriate because it may result in manipulation
of coefficient estimates and standard errors that do not val-
idly reflect the true nature of our sample data. We want to
preserve the integrity of the data and present it in its original
form (Fox-Wasylyshyn & El-Masri, 2005).
A secondary limitation of our study is that we did not con-
duct a factor analysis of possible latent constructs or theoreti-
cal dimensions. We used dichotomously coded variables as
indicators rather than creating composite indicators using fac-
tor analysis or confirmatory factor analysis. We avoided creat-
ing composite measures for substance use and criminal history
using factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis because
we wanted to identify, isolate, and model individual variables
and examine their relationships with post-treatment employ-
ment and gross earnings outcomes. We are interested in under-
standing the relationship between specific indicators of
substance use and criminal history among probationers and to
measure their effects on specific outcome variables. We
believe that our use of concrete indicators will allow for more
parsimonious interpretation and replication of our models.
Ethical Considerations
This study was designated as exempt by the Institutional
Review Board at California State University, Stanislaus.
This study used secondary data that were publicly available
from ICPSR (Deschenes, Turner, & Greenwood, 2013).
