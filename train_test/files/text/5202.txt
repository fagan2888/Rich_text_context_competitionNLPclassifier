Abstract
Objective: To investigate the incidence of insulin resistance (IR) and diabetes in patients with
chronic hepatic schistosomiasis japonica (HSJ) and portosystemic shunts (PSS).
Methods: Pre- and post-contrasted computed tomography images obtained from patients with
HSJ and control subjects were reviewed by two radiologists who identified and graded any shunting
vessels. Anthropometric measurements, hepatic enzymes, lipid profile, blood levels of albumin,
glucose, insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-2) index of all participants were also
assessed.
Results: Fifty-two patients with HSJ and 30 control subjects were involved in the study. The
coronary, short gastric and perisplenic veins were the most common shunting vessels. There were
no significant differences between patients and controls in terms of body mass index or liver
function. The degree of shunting vessels, blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test120/0
, insulin,
HOMA-2 index, glycosylated haemoglobin, cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein, and C-
reactive protein were significantly higher in the patients with IR. A positive correlation was found
between the degree of the shunting vessels and the HOMA-2 index.
Conclusions: Patients with chronic HSJ and PSS without liver dysfunction had a high incidence of
IR and diabetes. The study showed that PSS and IR are related and therefore patients with PSS
should be screened for IR and vice versa.

Introduction
Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with
cirrhosis regardless of its cause including
alcohol, hepatitis C infection or cholestatic
liver disease.1,2 IR is thought to occur as a
consequence of liver dysfunction, which
has an important impact on glucose metab-
olism.2,3 However, recent studies have
demonstrated that portal hypertension and
portosystemic shunts (PSS) are also factors
that contribute to IR.4­6 Portal hypertension
is the most common complication of cirrhosis
and can lead to PSS3 and several reports
suggest that PSS are the major cause of IR.7,8
Measuring portal pressure is difficult to
performinroutineclinicalpracticebecauseitis
an invasive procedure that is dependent on the
physician's skill.5,6 However, computed tom-
ography (CT) can be used as a non-invasive
tool for evaluating portal pressure indirectly
by measuring the degree of shunting vessels.9
Schistosomiasis affects more than 230
million people worldwide and remains a
major public health problem in many
developing countries.10 In 2009, approxi-
mately 65 million people in China were at
risk of infection and 0.36 million individuals
were infected.10 Although the majority of
patients with primary hepatic schistosomia-
sis japonica (HSJ) are completely cured, its
sequelae irreversibly develop into progres-
sive periportal fibrosis that can lead to
portal hypertension and PSS.11 Many
patients with HSJ are clinically neglected
because they typically do not exhibit any
obvious signs or symptoms and tend to visit
the hospital only after developing serious
complications, which are usually due to PSS
(e.g., upper gastrointestinal bleeding or hep-
atic encephalopathy).11,12 To the best of our
knowledge, no previous study has focused
on the changes in glucose metabolism in
patients with chronic HSJ. Therefore, the
aim of this current study was to investigate
the incidence of IR and diabetes in patients
with chronic HSJ and PSS.
Patients and methods
Study population
From March 2014 to September 2015,
patients with a history of HSJ were recruited
from Jinshan Hospital, Fudan University,
Shanghai, China, which is located in a
former HSJ endemic region. The disease was
confirmed by combining the findings of a
typical liver ultrasonography with results of
clinical tests and a history of infection. Active
schistosomiasis was diagnosed by positive
Kato-Katz test.13 Exclusion criteria included
active schistosomiasis, history of viral hepa-
titis, alcoholism, hepatocellular carcinoma,
primary hypertension, type 1 diabetes and
type 2 diabetes in first-degree relatives (i.e., to
avoid genetic factors). Healthy volunteers
served as control subjects. The control sub-
jects were recruited from the local population
attending a clinic for routine examination
(Department of Physical Examination
Centre, Jinshan Hospital, Jinshan, Shanghai).
ThestudywasapprovedbytheInstitutional
Review Board of Jinshan Hospital of Fudan
University, Shanghai, China (No. 201403) and
written informed consent was obtained from
all participants before CT imaging and labora-
tory tests were performed.
Clinical data collection
After a 12-h fast, blood samples were col-
lected from all participants and analysed for
Li et al. 1041
levels of insulin, glycosylated haemoglobin
(HbA1c
), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol
(Cho), high-density lipoprotein (HDL),
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and C-
reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotrans-
ferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin
time (PT) and albumin (Alb) using standard
biochemical procedures. After the samples
were collected, each participant underwent
an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). For
this test, the participant received 75 g
glucose orally and plasma glucose was
measured at 0, 60 and 120 min. The differ-
ence between the 120 min and 0 min glucose
levels (OGTT 120/0
) was calculated.
The body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated as follows: BMI ¼ mass/height2.
Insulin resistance was determined using the
updated homeostasis model assessment
(HOMA-2) index.5 Using the HOMA-2
calculator (http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homa-
calculator/), steady state b-cell function (%
B), insulin sensitivity (%S) and HOMA-2
index were calculated. Patients with a
HOMA-2 index > 2 were considered to
have IR.
CT image analyses
Pre- and post-contrasted CT images in the
arterial and portal phase were taken for
all participants using a 128-slice CT scanner
(SOMATOMÕ; Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany). UltravistÕ contrast medium
was used (370 mg I/ml; Bayer Healthcare,
Berlin, Germany) and administered intra-
venously at a dose of 2 ml/kg and at a rate of
3 ml/s. The parameters were as follows:
120 kV tube voltage; 200 mA tube current;
0.6 mm collimation; 1.0-mm slice thickness;
0.6 mm interval; and 1 pitch. The scanning
range extended from above the diaphragm
to the inferior pole of the right kidney.
All of the imaging data were recon-
structed by two radiologists (i.e., one
author [Y.L.] and the other an independent
assessor) who were blinded to participant
information. The axial and coronal thin-slab
(10 mm) multiplanar reformations of the
portal phase were reconstructed and
observed by scrolling the mouse at a work-
station (Syngo; Siemens). The presence,
anatomy and grade of the shunting vessels
were evaluated according to the procedures
described in previous reports.14­16 The
degree of a shunting was evaluated using a
four-point scale (i.e., 0, no shunting vessels;
1, mild dilatation of a shunting vessel; 2,
moderate dilatation (round) of a shunting
vessel; 3, significant dilatation (tubular or
serpentine) of a shunting vessel.14 For each
patient, the total score for all shunting
vessels was calculated independently by the
two radiologists and the mean of the two
scores was used to indicate the degree of
shunting.
Statistical analyses
The sample size was estimated using a
clinical research sample size calculator
(CRESS V1.3). Although only 19 patients
with HSJ and 19 control subjects were
required to detect a significant difference in
HOMA-2 IR between the two groups with
a ¼ 0.05 and b ¼ 0.1, the study recruited as
many subjects that became available in the
study duration period.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. One-way analysis of
variance was used for the laboratory tests
and the nonparametric Kruskal­Wallis test
was used to evaluate the degree of the
shunting vessels. Spearman's rank correl-
ation coefficient was used to determine the
correlation between the degree of the shunt-
ing vessels and HOMA-2 index or diabetes.
Agreement between the two radiologists was
estimated by calculating k statistics and was
interpreted as follows: < 0.40, fair
agreement; 0.41­0.60, moderate agreement;
0.61­0.80, substantial agreement; and
1042 Journal of International Medical Research 44(5)
0.81­1.00, almost perfect agreement.17 A
probability level of < 0.05 was considered
to be statistically significant.
Results
Of the 135 patients with HSJ that were
recruited to the study, 83 were excluded
(active schistosomiasis [n ¼ 1], history of
viral hepatitis [n ¼ 45], alcoholism [n ¼ 2],
hepatocellular carcinoma [n ¼ 8], primary
hypertension [n ¼ 11], type 1 diabetes or
type 2 diabetes in first-degree relatives
[n ¼ 16]). Therefore, 52 patients (25 men,
27 women) were enrolled into the study;
their ages ranged from 58 to 89 years
(mean Æ SD, 73.7 Æ 7.8 years). All patients
had HSJ and had been cured for more than
35 years. Schistosoma japonicum eggs were
not detected in the faeces of any of the
patients. Previous upper digestive bleeding
had been recorded in 31 patients (60%) but
none of them had experienced a bleed within
the previous 3 months. Splenomegaly was
found in 25 patients (48%) and ascites in
three patients (6%). Neurological
symptoms, such as deficits in attention,
disturbance of sleep, rigidity and tremor
were observed in 22 (42%).
According to plasma glucose levels,
results of the OGTT and the HOMA-2
index, patients were subdivided into the
following groups: non-IR (n ¼ 17), IR with-
out diabetes (n ¼ 16), and IR with diabetes
(n ¼ 19). Thirty healthy volunteers
(mean Æ SD age, 72.6 Æ 9.3 years; 10 men,
20 women) served as age-matched control
subjects.
Typical long stripes of strong echo or
hyperdense calcification in the liver were seen
on ultrasound or CT images of the patients
with HSJ. The anatomical types and the
frequency of the shunting vessels in the 52
patients with HSJ are shown in Table 1.
Thirteen types of shunting vessels (i.e.,
coronary, gastroepiploic, oesophageal, para-
oesophageal, short gastric, perisplenic,
splenorenal, gastrorenal, paraumbilical,
abdominal wall vein, retroperitoneal-para-
vertebral, mesenteric and omental) were
identified and graded. The coronary vein,
short gastric vein, perisplenic vein,

gastroepiploic vein, and splenorenal vein
were the five most frequent vessels of PSS
and were found in at least 50% of the
patients. Vessels wider than 6 mm were
clearly observed and could be distinguished
from the lymph nodes on post-contrasted CT
images (Figure 1). The k statistics agreement
between the two radiologists was 0.80 and so
the interobserver agreement was substantial.
A mild, moderate and significant degree of
the shunting vessels was observed in 14, 31
and 7 patients, respectively.
There were no statistically significant
differences between all four study groups in
terms of BMI or liver function (i.e., ALT,
AST, TB, TG, Alb) (Table 2). The degree of
the shunting vessels, plasma glucose,
OGTT120/0
, plasma insulin, HOMA-2
index, HbA1c
, Cho, HDL, LDL, and CRP
were significantly different between the
patients with IR and the control subjects (see
Table 2 for the specific details of the significant
between-group differences; P< 0.05).
Compared with non-IR patients, there
were significantly more shunts and higher
OGTT120/0
levels, insulin concentrations
and HOMA-2 index values in patients with
IR (see Table 2 for the specific details of
the significant between-group differences;
P < 0.05).

Patients with diabetes had significantly
higher glucose, HbA1c
, Cho and LDL levels
compared with non-IR patients and signifi-
cantly higher glucose, HbA1c
, Cho, LDL and
CRP compared with control subjects
(P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Significantly
lower HDL and higher CRP values were
observed in all patients with IR (i.e., with and
without diabetes) compared with the control
subjects (P < 0.05 for all comparisons).
The correlation between the degree of the
shunting veins and HOMA-2 index is shown
in Figure 2. A significant positive correlation
was found between the degree of shunting
vessels and the HOMA-2 index (r ¼ 0.67;
P < 0.05; Spearman's rank correlation coef-
ficient). In addition, multivariate logistic
regression analysis showed that HDL levels
were correlated with IR (r ¼ ­0.34 and
P < 0.05; data not shown).
Discussion
This present study demonstrated that in
patients with chronic HSJ and normal liver
function with PSS there was a high incidence

of IR and diabetes; 67% of patients had IR
and 37% had diabetes. These findings are
similar to a previous study in cirrhotic
patients that showed a 60% to 80% preva-
lence of IR and a 30% prevalence of
diabetes.4 In patients with chronic HSJ
with IR and normal plasma glucose in the
present study, the function of b-cells was
upgraded resulting in a statistically signifi-
cantly higher HOMA-2 %B value compared
with non-IR patients or control subjects. In
these patients, the combination of sufficient
insulin secreted by the pancreas to reduce
the amount of glucose and the decreased
insulin clearance due to PSS lead to hyper-
insulinaemia. With the progression of the
disease, the pancreas would `burn out' and
hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia would
ensue.18 An interesting observation was that
the CRP level was elevated in all patients
with chronic HSJ compared with control
subjects, which is suggestive of systemic
inflammation.19
Liver dysfunction is generally perceived
to be the main contributing factor of IR
because of a decrease in hepatic insulin
clearance.1 However, the aetiology of IR in
these patients is unclear because portal
hypertension and PSS are common compli-
cations in cirrhotic patients and they may
also contribute to the IR.4­6
One study showed that in patients with
chronic HSJ, the primary pathological
changes were marked periportal fibrosis,
relatively intact hepatic sinusoids and
slight hepatocyte injuries that are different
from those in cirrhosis or other liver dis-
eases.20 These pathological changes lead to
portal hypertension and subsequent PSS.3
In the present study, all patients with
chronic HSJ had a normal liver function,
which was consistent with findings from our
previous study.12 A lack of correlation
between IR and liver histological severity
in cirrhotic patients has been reported else-
where.21,22 Therefore, we hypothesize that
IR in patients with chronic HSJ might be
caused by portal hypertension and subse-
quent PSS rather than by liver dysfunction.
This present study confirmed that CT
imaging can be used to evaluate the degree
of shunting vessels.9 A positive correlation
was found between the degree of shunting
vessels and the HOMA-2 index. The most
frequent shunting vessels were the coronary
vein, short gastric vein, perisplenic vein,

gastroepiploic vein, and splenorenal vein,
which cannot be evaluated by endoscopy.14
Therefore, when a patient with chronic HSJ
and PSS is identified, regardless of liver
function, IR or diabetes should be con-
sidered and investigated. Conversely, in an
HSJ endemic region, in any patient with IR
or diabetes, PSS should be considered as a
contributing factor in their pathogenesis.
The present study had several limitations.
First, patients with HSJ and PSS often lack
clinical features and so some patients with-
out a clear history of schistosomiasis may
have unintentionally been excluded from the
study so creating a population bias.
Secondly, elevated CRP was found in
patients with HSJ and IR but no clinical
features of systemic inflammation were
found in these patients. Further studies are
required to confirm these current findings.
In conclusion, the present study demon-
strated that patients with chronic HSJ and
PSS without liver dysfunction had a high
incidence of IR and diabetes. Additionally,
the study showed that PSS and IR are
related and so patients with PSS should be
screened for IR and vice versa.
