Abstract
Objective: To identify the 50 top-cited spine articles from mainland China and to analyze their
main characteristics.
Methods: Web of Science was used to identify the 50 top-cited spine articles from mainland China
in 27 spine-related journals. The title, year of publication, number of citations, journal, anatomic
focus, subspecialty, evidence level, city, institution and author were recorded.
Results: The top 50 articles had 29­122 citations and were published in 11 English-language
journals; most (32) were published in the 2000s. The journal Spine had the largest number of
articles and The Lancet had the highest impact factor. The lumber spine was the most discussed
anatomic area (18). Degenerative spine disease was the most common subspecialty topic (22).
Most articles were clinical studies (29); the others were basic research (21). Level IV was the most
common evidence level (17).
Conclusions: This list indicates the most influential articles from mainland China in the global
spine research community. Identification of these articles provides insights into the trends in spine
care in mainland China and the historical contributions of researchers from mainland China to the
international spine research field.

Introduction
Mainland China has the largest population
in the world and has shown rapid economic
progress. These factors have led to substan-
tial biomedical developments1­5 and recent
improvements in spine care in mainland
China.6,7 In addition, the country has the
largest number of orthopedic surgeons in the
world.8 Therefore, mainland China is an
important leader in the field of spine
research,6,7,9­11 although influential spine
research from this region has yet to be
studied.
Multiple methods are used to assess the
significance of medical studies. The citation
of a previous paper indicates the importance
of the previous study to the current article.
The importance of a study is often assessed
using citation analysis.12­14 The number of
citations is a marker of the influence of an
article and offers a reliable method to rank
articles. The larger an article's citation his-
tory, the more valuable the article is to its
field.15,16
Web of Science is an important database
that provides citation metrics and other
academic impact information. This platform
has been widely used to analyze the most-
cited articles in various medical fields.17­33
One 2012 study used a citation index to
examine the most-cited articles in the spine
research field,34 permitting a deeper under-
standing of the characteristics of influential
papers. However, this previous study did not
include any Chinese spine articles.34
Moreover, to the best of our knowledge,
there are no analyses of the top-cited spine
papers from mainland China, indicating
that the contribution of Chinese spine sur-
geons and researchers to the global spine
research community has not been ade-
quately investigated. Therefore, this study
aimed to identify the 50 top-cited spine
papers originating from mainland China,
to analyze their main characteristics and to
provide a unique insight into mainland
China's most important contributions to
the spine research field.
Materials and methods
The citation search was performed on
April 6, 2016, using the Web of Science
database (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania), which has been used in pre-
vious similar studies.16,29,33­36 Based on
a previous paper published in 2012,34
27 spine-related journals were included in
the literature search (Table 1). These jour-
nals were chosen from the Web of Science
categories, including ``Orthopedics,''

``Neurosciences,'' ``Neurology,''
``Rehabilitation,'' ``Sports Sciences,''
``Medicine, General and Internal'' and
``Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, and
Medical Imaging.'' These 27 journals regu-
larly publish articles about spine research.
The inclusion criteria of this study were
(1) spine-related articles; (2) from mainland
China; and (3) ranked in the top 50 papers
according to the number of citations. Based
on previous similar publications,16,33­37 the
articles from these 27 journals were ordered
by number of citations. To exclude papers
not from mainland China, ``Peoples R
China'' was selected in the record field
``Countries/territories.'' Articles that lacked
a primary or reprint address in mainland
China were excluded. This ensured that
articles with one or more Chinese co-authors
but that were not from mainland China were
not included.
The 50 top-cited spine papers from main-
land China were included in this study. The
title, year of publication, number of cit-
ations, journal, anatomic focus, subspeci-
alty, level of evidence, city, institution and
author were recorded and analyzed.

Discussion
Citation analysis has been widely used to
investigate the top-cited papers in many
biomedical fields,16­33,37 and has been
applied to the field of spine research.34
However, previous research has not
included Chinese articles in the global top-
cited spine articles.34 In addition, to the best
of our knowledge, the top-cited spine papers
from mainland China have not been
reported, despite the increasing importance
of Chinese spine surgeons and researchers to
the international spine community.6,7,36
Therefore, we aimed to identify and
characterize the 50 most-cited spine articles
from mainland China and to provide a
unique perspective on Chinese spine
research.
We found that the 50 top-cited papers
were reported between 1987 and 2012 and
that 2000­2009 was the most prolific decade.
This finding is inconsistent with analysis of
the global spine research field, which showed
that 1990­1999 was the most important
decade.34 This may be explained by an
historical lack of financial funds and articles
published in English in mainland China

owing to a less developed economy.88,89 In
contrast, the recent increase in influential
papers reflects the greater development of
the Chinese spine research field.6,7
The 50 top-cited spine papers had
between 29 and 122 citations. These num-
bers are substantially lower than those for
the global spine field (which showed the
lowest citation number as 244);34 this may
be because the previous study did not
include Chinese articles.34 This finding indi-
cates that although the quantity of Chinese
articles has increased, the quality of Chinese
articles needs to improve.6,7
All the included papers were published in
English. One of the main reasons for this is
that English is the most common language
of influential articles in the field of spine
research and other orthopedic subspecial-
ties.16,34,35,37,90­94 This result may indicate
that Chinese authors experience a language
barrier that results in fewer spine research
publications from China than from Western
countries.
The 50 top-cited papers were reported in
11 journals. Among them, Spine published
the greatest number of papers. The first four
journals published nearly three-quarters of
the total number of articles: Spine, European
Spine Journal, Clinical Orthopaedics and
Related Research, and Journal of
Neurosurgery: Spine. Three of these are
subspecialty spine journals. This may indi-
cate that the influential articles are mainly
published in subspecialty spine journals.
Moreover, previous studies have suggested
that impact factor should be the most
important indicator of article citations, and
many of the most-cited papers have been
published in high-impact factor publica-
tions.16,17,95 However, the present findings
do not support this. The Lancet, which has
the highest impact factor (45.217), published
only one paper. Spine, which has a lower
impact factor (2.297), published the largest
number of papers (n ¼ 23). This may
indicate that citations are not always
affected by impact factor. This has been
suggested by previous researchers20,34 and
indicates the importance of considering sev-
eral factors when investigating citations in
certain journals.16,34,37,93
Authors from 12 cities were responsible
for the 50 top-cited articles. Beijing ranked
1st, and Shanghai ranked 2nd, suggesting
that Beijing and Shanghai play an important
role in Chinese spine research. This can be
attributed to the large number of spine
surgeons and researchers and adequate
financial research funds in these cities.16,29
Of the top 50 studies, clinical studies were
more popular than basic research. This
finding is consistent with previous study
findings on global spine research.34
However, the proportion of clinical stu-
dies/basic research in mainland China is
much smaller than that worldwide (29/21
versus 81/19, respectively). This suggests the
need to improve Chinese spine-related clin-
ical research. One previous study found a
relatively greater number of basic research
studies in current Chinese clinical research.2
There are several possible reasons for this
phenomenon. Clinical studies are very com-
plicated and require long-term intervention
and follow-ups. Mainland China has a large
number of patients with spine-related prob-
lems and this could facilitate recruitment of
greater numbers of patients in clinical
studies. However, mainland China lacks a
high-quality healthcare system equal to that
in developed countries.9 Therefore, the
lower quality of health care in mainland
China may hinder patient participation in
clinical studies. In addition, insufficient
research funds and a lack of available time
have resulted in fewer clinical studies in
mainland China.2,96 However, these disad-
vantages may be reduced in the Chinese
spine research field. Medical system reforms,
increased experience in conducting clinical
studies and greater investment in research is
Wu et al. 779
likely to improve research in mainland
China in future years.9­11
Some limitations of this study should be
noted. First, we selected spine-related jour-
nals based on previous research.34 These
journals do not include all spine articles,
because some basic research journals and
general journals also publish spine-related
articles. However, no search strategy can
identify all spine articles. Generally, the
articles published in journals not indexed
in this study are likely to have fewer cit-
ations than those that we indexed.34 Second,
this was a cross-sectional study design with a
single time point. The rankings identified
may change if the study is replicated in the
future.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
bibliometric analysis of the most-cited spine
articles from mainland China. The study
findings indicate an increase in the number
of influential papers published by the
Chinese spine research community in
recent years. The present study identifies
the most influential Chinese articles in
global spine research, provides a general
picture of Chinese historical contributions
to the global spine research community and
illustrates trends in spine care in mainland
China. We believe that this study will help
surgeons, researchers and managers to rec-
ognize the main characteristics of Chinese
spine research and will form the basis of
future high-impact studies.
