Background. The purpose of the study was to examine religious attendance as a predictor of survival in older adults.
Methods. A probability sample of 3,968 community-dwelling adults aged 64-101 years residing in the Piedmont of North
Carolina was surveyed in 1986 as part of the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE)
program of the National Institutes of Health. Attendance at religious services and a wide variety of sociodemographic and
health variables were assessed at baseline. Vital status of members was then determined prospectively over the next 6 years
(1986-1992). Time (days) to death or censoring in days was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.
Results. During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1,777 subjects (29.7%) died. Of the subjects who attended religious
services once a week or more in 1986 (frequent attenders), 22.9% died compared to 37.4% of those attending services less than
once a week (infrequent attenders). The relative hazard (RH) of dying for frequent attenders was 46% less than for infrequent
attenders (RH: 0.54, 95% CI 0.48-.0.61), an effect that was strongest in women (RH 0.51, CI 0.43--0.59) but also present in
men (RH 0.63,95% CI 0.52--0.75).When demographics, health conditions, social connections, and health practices were con-
trolled, this effect remained significant for the entire sample (RR 0.72,95% CI 0.64-.81), and for both women (RH 0.65,95%
CI 0.55--o.76,p<.OOOI)and men (RH 0.83, 95% CIO.69-1.00,p=.05).
Conclusions. Older adults, particularly women, who attend religious services at least once a week appear to have a survival
advantage over those attending services less frequently.
IN 1891, John S. Billings, then Surgeon General of the United
States Army, reported that religious affiliation was a factor in
the differential mortality he observed among social groups (1).
Not long afterwards, Emile Durkheim in 1915 laid the founda-
tion for such a connection by pointing out the potential health
consequences of weakening or absent religious ties (2). The
majority of studies of religion and health since Durkheim, how-
ever, have been affiliational studies that have focused on the di-
etary and health practices of different religious groups [particu-
larly Mormons and Seventh-Day Adventists (3)].
A number of epidemiological studies (4,5) and clinical trials
(6,7), however, have demonstrated an association between so-
cial support, better physical health, and longer survival. Given
Durkheim's theories and the growing evidence suggesting a re-
lationship between church or synagogue attendance and social
support (8,9), a number of investigators have now begun exam-
ining the link between religious attendance and health (10,11).
Attendance at religious services has been associated with higher
well-being (12), less depression (13,14), less anxiety (15), less
substance abuse (14,16), and fewer suicides (17) as well as
lower blood pressure (18,19),fewer strokes (20), and longer sur-
vival, even after controlling for social support in some cases. At
least seven studies have now examined the relationship between
religious attendance and mortality.
In 1972, Comstock and Partridge (21) first reported that fre-
quent church attenders had lower death rates from arterioscle-
rotic heart disease, pulmonary emphysema, cirrhosis of the
liver, and suicide; these findings, however, were later explained
M370
by the fact that chronically ill persons attended church less fre-
quently (22). In a 9-12-year follow-up study of 2,754 commu-
nity-dwelling persons aged 35-69 in the Tecumseh (Michigan)
Community Health Study, House and colleagues (23) reported
that frequent church attendance was significantly related to sur-
vival, but only among women after age and health factors were
controlled. Schoenbach and associates (24) followed 2,530
community-dwelling persons (mean age 46) in the Evans
County (Georgia) Cardiovascular Study for 10 years, finding
that involvement in church activities was also significantly re-
lated to longer survival, but only among white males and black
females once age and health factors were controlled.
Zuckerman and colleagues (25) followed 400 elderly poor resi-
dents of New Haven, CT, for two years, finding that religious
attendance was among the variables significantly related to
lower mortality after sex and physical health were controlled,
but the effects were slightly stronger in men than in women.
In contrast, when Idler and Kasl (26) examined 4-year mor-
tality rates in a sample of 2,812 community-dwelling adults aged
65 or older in New Haven (of whom 624 had died), they found
no association between religious attendance and mortality after
self-rated health and other variables were controlled. Likewise,
Oxman and associates (27), examining 6-month survival in 232
subjects aged 55 or older following elective open heart surgery
(of whom 21 had died), found religious attendance unrelated to
mortality once physical health factors were controlled.
In the largest and best designed study to date, Strawbridge
and colleagues (28) reported the results of a 28-year follow-up
REUGIOUSATFENDANCEAND SURVIVAL M37l
study of 5,286 persons aged 21 to 65 years who participated in
the Human Population Laboratory Study of Alameda County
(California); by 1993, 770 participants had died. They found
that persons who attended religious services at least once a
week had a significantly lower risk of dying after controlling
for demographic variables, health conditions, social connec-
tions, and health practices (relative hazard [RH] 0.77). The as-
sociation, however, weakened to nonsignificance in men when
health conditions were controlled.
The presentstudyis uniquein several respects. Thepopulation-
basedsamplecomprises nearly4,000olderadults(38%men, 62%
women) who haveexperiencedrelativelyhigh mortality(30% or
1,177deaths)duringthe6 yearssincethecohortwasformed,thus
providingsubstantialpower for examiningpredictorsof survival.
This is one of the largestpopulation-basedsample of elders with
the longest surveillance (of an elderly sample). Vital status was
carefully monitoredevery year, and deaths were documented by
death certificates.Multiple subjectiveand objectivemeasures of
physicalhealth,socialsupport,andhealthpracticeswereavailable
for analysis, similar to those used in theAlameda County Study
(28), after which the present study's analysisplan was modeled.
We hypothesizethat (a) frequent attendanceat religious services
willpredictlongersurvival, an effectthatwill persistaftercontrol-
ling for knownpredictors of mortality,and (b) the effects will be
greaterin womenthanin men (given priorresults intheliterature).
METHODS
Community-dwellingadultsage 65 or older were sampledfor
theDuke University siteof the NationalInstitutes of Health-spon-
sored Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of
the Elderly(EPESE)program(29).In 1986,subjectswere identi-
fied for the first wave of this study using a four-stage stratified
probabilitysampleof personsfrom fivecontiguouscounties (one
urban and four rural) in central North Carolina.In the firststage,
450 primary sampling units of approximately equal population
size were selectedfrom the surveyarea. In the second stage, one
listing area was selected from each sampling unit. In the third
stage,all householdsin a listingarea wereenumerated,and a cer-
tain number were randomly selected from this list. In the fourth
stage,the Kishmethod (30) was used to selecta person age 65 or
older from each eligible household. Approximately half of the
final sample came from the urban county and the rest from the
rural counties. Because the Duke EPESE focused on ethnic dif-
ferences, black elders were oversampled (54% of sample). A
totalof 5,223eligiblepersons were identified, and 4,162 subjects
(80% response) completed in-person interviewsin their homes.
After proxy interviews were excluded, 4,000 evaluations re-
mained;data on religiousattendancewere available for the 3,968
subjectswho constitutethe samplefor thisreport.
Baseline and Follow-upInterviews
Vitalstatus.-After the initial evaluationin 1986,participants
were contactedfor follow-up interviewseveryyeareitherby tele-
phone or in person. Field investigators provided continuous
surveillancethroughpersonal contact or proxy information, and
confirmed dates of death within the cohort by abstracting death
certificates(n=1177).Follow-uptime wascalculatedin days be-
tween the baseline and the sixth follow-up interview, (i.e., the
third in-person interview, which took place in 1992).
Respondents who were lost to follow-up prior to the sixth inter-
view (n=300) or who livedbeyondthe sixth interview(n=2,49l)
were censored, respectively,at 183days (6 months) beyond the
lastcontactdate or at the dateof theirsixthinterview.
Religious attendance.-Religious attendance at baseline was
assessedby asking the question, "Abouthow often do you go to
religious meetings or services?" Response options were (a)
never/almost never, (b) once or twice a year, (c) every few
months, (d) once or twice a month,(e)once a week,and (f) more
than once a week. Responses were dichotomized into less than
once a week (code=O) and once a week or more (codeeI); 53%
of the sample attendedreligiousservicesat leastonce a week.
Baseline Covariates
Covariates were chosen because of demonstrated associa-
tions with mortality (31-38). One objective was to follow as
closely as possible Strawbridge and colleagues' method of han-
dling variables and analyzing the data so that results could be
compared (28). For that reason, all covariates except age were
dichotomized.
Demographicvariahles.-Demographic variables includedage
(64-101 years), gender (male=O, femalee l), ethnicity(whiteeO,
black»1),andeducation(0-11 years=O, 12yearsor more=1).
Functioning.-Physical functioningwas measured by asking
about the person's ability to perform activities of daily living
(ADLs) independently. Physical ADLs [(39) bathing, dressing,
eating, getting from bed to chair, toilet use], instrumentalADLs
[(40) traveling, shopping, preparing meals, doing housework,
managing finances],and strength/enduranceADLs [(41) able to
do heavy work around house, walk up and down flightof stairs,
and walk half a mile or eight city blocks] were assessed.
Subjects with no ADL impairment (code=O) were compared to
those with one or more impairedADLs (codeel).
Self-rated health.-Global self-rating of health (38) was
measured with a single item that asked, "Overall, how would
you rate your health-as excellent, good, fair, or poor?"
Responses were dichotomized into good or excellent (code=O)
versusfair or poor (code=1).
Chronic conditions.-The presence or absence of eight
chronic conditions was assessed (broken hip, cancer, diabetes,
hearing problems, vision problems, high blood pressure, short-
ness of breath, and stroke). Subjects with no chronic conditions
(code=O) were compared to those with one or more chronic
conditions (code=1).
Depression.-Depressive symptoms were assessed using the
20-itemCenterfor Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CBS-D)
scale(42).The itemson theCES-D werepresentedtorespondents
in a yes-no format; positiveresponses were summed to create a
scalerangingfrom 0 to 20.Scoresweredichotomized intodepres-
sion absent (scores 0-8, code=O) and depression present (scores
9-20, code=l) (43).
Negativelifeevents.-Negative lifeevents(NLEs)experienced
during the year prior to the baseline evaluation were recorded
M372 KOENIGETAL.
(44). Events included illness or injury requiring hospitalization,
illness or injury preventing usual activities, divorce, death of
spouse or child, spouse or child leavehome, close family member
or friend die or experience seriousillness,legal trouble, retirement
from work, financial change, relocation, and other stressor.
Subjects with none of these negative life events (codeeO) were
compared to those experiencing one or more NLE (code=l).
Marital status.-Subjects who were divorced, separated,
widowed, or single in 1986 (code-O) were compared to those
who were married (code= 1).
Social support.-Social support was assessed using four of
the five subscales of the Duke Social Support Index (45).
Subscales included here were a 7-item social network subscale;
a 2-item confidant subscale (perceived presence of a confidant
or someone to provide support in difficult times); a 2-item sub-
jective support subscale (perceived satisfaction with amount of
contact with friends/relatives); and a 13-item instrumental sup-
port subscale (amount of help received). The fifth subscale, as-
sessing social interaction, was dropped because it includes
membership in church-related groups that would confound the
analysis. Scores on these subscales were dichotomized at ap-
proximately the midpoint of their distribution in the sample into
low (code=O)and high (codee l) categories.
Cigarette smoking.-Smoking was determined by the fol-
lowing questions: "Do you smoke cigarettes regularly now?"
Response options were "no" (code-O) and "yes" (code=1).
Alcohol consumption.-Alcohol use was determined by the
following three questions: "Over the last month how often have
you had beer or ale?"; "Over the last month how often have you
had wine?"; and "Over the last month how often have you had

createan alcoholuseindex.Subjectshavinglessthan20 drinking
occasions in the past month (code=O) were compared to those

Body fJUlSS index.-Body massindex(BMI)or QueteletIndex
was calculated by dividing a subject's weight in kilograms by
height in meters squared (46). BMI was divided into five quin-
tiles for analysis; persons in the lower four quintiles (code=O)
werecomparedto thosein the upperquintile(code:1).
Missing values at baseline.s-Covextsies with missing data at
baseline were handled in the following manner. For measures
withfewerthan2% missingvalues,themean valuewas imputed.
For measureswithbetween2% and5% missingdata (instrumen-
tal and enduranceADLs, marital status, social support scales),
imputedversionswere createdusingregression-predicted scores
(Y-hats). For measureswithmore than5% missingdata (11% for
NLEsand9% forBMI),we createdimputedversions usingmore
complicated stochastic regression techniques (47).
Statistical Analysis
Theprimaryhypothesis of the studyis toexaminereligiousat-
tendance asa predictor of survival inolderadults. Baseline associa-
tions betweenfrequentattendanceand covariateswere analyzed
throughpercentages and logisticregression models(48).Oddsra-
tios,adjustedforthecovariates age,sex,race,andeducation, were
obtainedusinglogisticregression withreligiousattendance as the
dependentvariable. Theassociation betweenfrequent religious at-
tendance andsurvival wasexamined usinga Coxproportional haz-
ardsregression model(49). Survival timewasenteredas days. The
validity of theproportional hazards assumption wasexaminedand
confirmedbothgraphically and withthe normalscoretestof pro-
portionality(50).Fivesequentialmodels were usedto assessthe
relative impactsofthecovariates on therelationship betweenatten-
danceandmortality. First, religious attendance wasexamined alone
in themodel;second,demographic variables (age,gender, educa-
tion,ethnicity) wereadded;third,physicalandmentalhealthvari-
ables(impairedfunction, chronicconditions, self-rated health,de-
pression,NLEs) were added;fourth,socialconnections(marital
status,socialnetwork,supportive confidants, helpreceived) were
added;and fifth, healthpractices(smokingcigarettesand alcohol
consumption)wereadded.Becausesatisfaction withsupportand
BMI were not related to religious attendance or mortality,they
werenot includedin the models.Gender differencesin outcome
andgender-specific associations betweenattendance andmortality
wereassessedby addinggenderby attendance interaction termsto
themodels.Analyseswerethenstratified by genderto obtainrela-
tivehazardratiosand95% confidence intervals. All analyses were
carriedout usingthe statistical softwareSAS [SASInstituteInc.,
Cary, NC](48).
RESULTS
Baseline Associations
Table 1 presents associations between frequent religious at-
tendance and covariates in 1986. Frequent religious attenders
were more than likelyto be women, better educated,and black.
They were less likelythaninfrequentattendersto have impaired
physicalfunctioning, chronichealthconditions,fairor poor self-
rated health, or depression. Frequentattenderswere more likely
to be married, havelarger socialnetworks, and haveconfidants,
personson whom theycould dependin timesof trouble.Finally,
frequent attenders were less likely to smoke cigarettes (51) and
lesslikelyto consumealcohol. Thus, at baseline,religiousatten-
ders were physically healthier, had more social support, and
livedhealthierlifestyles thanlessfrequentattenders.
Mortality and Survival
Frequentreligiousattenderswere less likelyto die thaninfre-
quent attenders during the median 2,293-day follow-up period
M374 KOENIG ETAL.
(22.9% vs 37.4%, X2=99.4, 1df,p<.OOI). Unadjusted Kaplan-
Meiersurvival curvesfor frequent andinfrequent religiousatten-
dersareplottedin Figure1.Table2 presents theresults of theCox
proportionalhazards analyses.Withoutcontrolvariablesin the
model(1), frequent religious attenders in 1986hada lowerrelative
hazard (RH)of dying compared withinfrequentattenders (RH
0.54,95% CI0.48-D.61). When age,gender, education,andeth-
nicitywereaddedto themodel (Il),therelationship wasreduced
slightly (RH0.59).Addinghealthconditions (ill), socialconnec-
tions(N), andhealthpractices (V)tothemodelproducedfurther
reductions in themagnitudeof relationship betweenreligious at-
tendanceandsurvival, butdid noteliminate it (RH0.72,95% CI
0.64-D.81,p<.OOOI).
Gender
The data in Table2 indicatethatthe relationshipbetweenre-
ligiousattendanceand survivaltendedto be greaterfor women
thanfor men.Beforecontrollingforcovariates, women who at-
tendedreligiousservicesonce a weekor more were only about
one-halfas likelyto die as womenattendingservicesless often
(RH 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.59); this effect was weaker in men
(RH 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75). When demographics, health
conditions, social connections, and health practices were suc-
cessivelyadded to the model, this reduced the relationship be-
tween religious attendance and survivalfor both genders, but
more so for men (RH 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.00,p=.05) than for
women (RH 0.65, 95% CI 0.55-0.76. p<.OOOl). The Sex by
Attendance interaction term approached significance in the final
model(unstandardized beta-D.22,SE 0.12,p=.07).
DISCUSSION
Weexaminedtherelationship betweenreligious attendance in
1986 and 6-year survivalin a cohort of 3,968 elderly persons.
Compared withlessfrequent attenders, persons attending religious
services oncea weekormoreatbaseline werephysically andmen-
tallyhealthier, hadlargersocial support networks, hadmoreconfi-
dantsandlivedhealthier lifestyles (lesssmoking andalcoholcon-
sumption). By 1992, nearly one third of the sample had died
(n=I,177).Analyses revealed thattheriskofdyingforfrequent at-
tenders was46%lowerthanforthoseattending services lessoften.
Thisrisklessened(28%)butremainedsignificant afteradjusting
fordemographic factors, physical andmental health conditions, so-
cialconnections, andhealthpractices (andwasequivalent inmag-
nitude to cigarette smoking). The association was stronger in
womenthaninmen(35%vs 17%), butwaspresent inbothsexes.
Our findings replicate those of Strawbridgeand colleagues'
28-yearfollow-up of 5,286 participants in theAlameda County
Study (28).They reported that the risk of dying was 23% less
(RH 0.77,95% CI 0.64-0.93) in frequent attenders (women,
RH 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.86; men, RH 0.90, 95% CI
0.70-1.15). Our results,however, extendtheirfindingsbecause
we includedpersonsaged 65 yearsor older(theAlamedaStudy
includedonlypersonsaged 21 to 65 years),and our samplewas
drawn from a southeastern U.S. community.In both studies, a
survivaladvantagewas found for frequent religious attenders,
and the advantage was strongerin womenthanin men.
Mechanism ofEffect
If religiousattendance did impact on health, how might this
haveoccurred?Therearea numberofpsychosocial andbehavioral
pathwaysby whichinvolvement in a religiouscommunitycould
affect health. First,wehaveseeninboththisstudyandothers that
frequent attenders have larger social networks and experience
greater supportthaninfrequentattenders (8,9,28).Becausefre-
quentattenders havemorecontact withothers, theymaybe subject
to greatersurveillance andcheckingforhealthproblems. Ifprob-
lemsareidentified byfellow congregants, theymaybeencouraged
toconsult a physician andperhaps be assisted ingetting tothedoc-
tor's office. In this way,diseasesmight be diagnosedearlierand
helpobtainedsooner(52). Greatsocialsupportmayalsohavedi-
recteffects on theimmune systemto fendoffdisease, facilitate re-
covery,or otherwiseextend survival(6,7). In a recent report of
1,718 community-dwelling olderadults, interleukin-6levels (anin-
dicator of immunesystem dysregulation) werefoundtobe signifi-
cantlyloweramongfrequent churchattenders aftercontrolling for
age,functional status, andchronic healthconditions (53).
Second,frequentreligiousattendancemay fosterattitudesof
compliance andcareforthephysical bodythatcarryoverintoad-
herenceto medical treatments. Conservativereligiousattitudes
(twothirdsofour sample wereconservative Protestants) mayfos-
tercompliance withmedication (54),keepingofmedical appoint-
ments(55,56), orparticipation inpreventive healthservices (57).
Third,religiousattendance is relatedto lowerratesof depres-
sion, anxiety, and stress.A strongreligious faith reinforcedby
active religious participation may help persons to cope better
with stressors,particularly physicalhealth problemsin laterlife
(58).Lowerrates of depression, likehigher socialsupport, may
translate into stronger immune systems and better defenses
against disease (59,60). Improved coping may also lead to
fewerdirect(17) andindirect(61)self-destructive behaviors.
Fourth, as we have seen in the present study, religious in-
volvementis associatedwith avoidanceof smoking(28,51,62),
reducedalcoholconsumption (16,28,63), and safersexualprac-
tices (64), all of which may prevent physical diseases that im-
pact on mortality.Strawbridge and colleagues (28), following
their sample over time, also discovered that frequent religious
attenders were more likely than infrequent attenders to stop
smoking, increase exercise, and stay married to the same per-
son. Thus, there are multiple pathways by which religious at-
tendancemay reducemortality and enhancesurvival.
In spite of controlling for several of these potential mecha-
nisms(e.g.,socialsupport, stress,depression), the effectof reli-
giousattendanceon survivalpersistedin both the current study
and the Strawbridge study. One reasonfor theunexplained vari-
anceis the use of relatively weakmeasuresto assessdepressive
symptoms, stress,and socialsupport. Both of thesestudies were
largeepidemiologicalsurveysthat necessitateda relativelysu-
perficialassessmentof theseconstructs.For example,our mea-
sure of stress involvednumber of stressful life events experi-
enced during the year prior to evaluation (hardly a robust
measure of current stress), and the Strawbridge study did not
reportany directmeasureof stress. Likewise,both studiesmea-
sured depression using a symptom checklist, which is not the
sameas depressiondiagnosedby clinicalevaluation or by struc-
turedpsychiatricinterview. Thus,had more in-depthpsychoso-
cial measures been available,a greater amount of the variance
in the attendanceeffectmighthavebeen explained.
Gender Effect
It is not clear why the association between religious atten-
REUGIOUSAITENDANCEAND SURVIVAL M375
dance and survival shouldbe strongerin womenthan in men, a
finding alsoreportedby both Strawbridge and associates (28)in
theAlamedaCountyStudyand by Houseandcolleagues (23)in
the Tecumseh Community Health Study.Women, in general,
tendto involve themselves in religious practices morethanmen.
In thepresentstudy, womenweremorelikelyto attendreligious
services frequently, and other studiesreport that they are more
likely than men to pray (65), say religion is important in their
lives (65), and depend on religion as a coping behavior (66).
Thus, it is possiblethat religiousbeliefsand practicesare more
ingrained in the social and psychological lives of women, and
thus conveygreater health effects. Strawbridgeand colleagues
(28) point out thatgiventhe much higherproportionof widow-
hood among older women, religious institutionsmay act to fill
an otherwiseunmetsocialneedfor support. Likewise, Idler(67)
stressesa generaltendency for womento seekand use socialin-
teractionto cope with stress.None of theseexplanations,how-
ever,can accountfor the equal or strongerrelationship between
religious attendance and survival inmenreportedby otherinves-
tigatorsin Georgia(24)and Connecticut(25).Thus, genderdif-
ferences in the association betweenreligious attendance and sur-
vivalremainsomewhat a mystery.
Limitations
We did not include time-varying covariatesin our analyses
(as Strawbridge and colleagues did). Thus, the impact of
changesin health,socialsupports,andhealthbehaviors was not
assessed. Furthermore, we did not measure other important
variablesthatmighthelp to explainthe relationship betweenre-
ligious attendance and mortality, such as beliefs or attitudes
about the effects of religious faith on health, dietary practices,
exercise, or level of psychosocial stress (other than number of
NLEs, where 11% of data weremissing). Detailedclinicalmea-
sures of physical and mental health were also lacking. Atten-
dance at religiousservicesis also a relatively weak indicatorof
a deep, enduringreligiousfaith, as personsmay attend services
for reasonsotherthan religiousones.Measuresof intrinsicreli-
giosity (i.e., the extent to which religious beliefs and commit-
ment are the motivatingfactors in a person's life) were not ob-
tained (68).While religiousattendanceand intrinsicreligiosity
are related (Pearsonr=O.44, n=455),they are not the same and
may nothavethe samehealtheffects(69).
Finally, over 95% of our sample were affiliated with tradi-
tional Judeo-Christian religious groups (59% Baptist, 17%
Methodist, 4% Presbyterian, 4% Pentecostal/Holiness, 11%
other Protestant),and the results may only be generalizable to
personsfromthesereligiousbackgrounds. The studytook place
in the Bible Belt (southeastern United States), where rates of
religious attendance may be higher than in other parts of the
country (53% of our participants attended weekly or more
often).Nevertheless, a recentnationalsurveyby the GallupPoll
found that 53% of persons aged 65 or older attendedchurch or
synagoguewithinthe past7 days (65).
Conclusions
Frequentreligiousattendancehas nowbeen foundin at least
two large, population-basedstudieslocated at oppositeends of
the United States to be associated with a reduced hazard of
dying,particularlyamong women.Frequentreligiousattenders
in both studiesreported greater social support,less depression,
and better health practices (reduced smoking and alcoholcon-
sumption), factors thatmaypreservehealthandextendsurvival.
These factors, however,were not sufficientto explain the rela-
tionship between religious attendance and longer survival.
Replication of thesefindings is neededfrom prospective studies
that correct for some of the methodological limitations noted
above. Furtherresearchis alsonecessaryto identifythe specific
psychosocial, behavioral,and biological mechanisms by which
involvement in thereligious community preventsdisease, main-
tainshealth,or speedsrecovery.
