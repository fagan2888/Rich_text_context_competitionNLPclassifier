Do Hostile Opinion Environments Harm Political
Participation? The Moderating Role of Generalized
Social Trust

Abstract
This article attempts to reevaluate the democratic implications of opinion diversity by
showing that politically hostile social networks do not necessarily discourage political
participation. It is theorized that generalized social trust, as an individual differences
variable, can explain how individuals expect others to behave when deviating opinions
are voiced. In contrast to high social trust individuals, low trust individuals believe
others will react negatively to such dissent. Thus, it is hypothesized that low trust
individuals refrain from participation when confronted with a hostile social network.
Using U.S. representative survey data, Study 1 confirms that a demobilizing effect of
hostile networks can only be observed for lower levels of social trust. Study 2 rep-
licates this finding with an online survey addressing the underlying mechanism in a
mediated moderation analysis. It is shown that social trust fuels behavioral expect-
ations about how others will react to dissent. These expectations, in turn, explain how
hostile networks dampen participation.
General conceptions of democratic citizenship maintain that citizens should
develop habits and capacities conducive to sound political judgment, they
should consider others' views in skilled and democratic conversation, and
express their will and interests in and outside the voting booth. Many efforts
have been made to identify the factors that can increase political participation
and enhance civic engagement (e.g., Nir, 2005, 2011; Nir & Druckman, 2008).
As one of those factors, there is a growing interest in the roles of the imme-
diate social network (Campus, Pasquino, & Vaccari, 2008; McClurg, 2006;
Nir, 2005, 2011; Pattie & Johnston, 2009; Rojas, 2008; Wojcieszak, 2009).
Some research suggests that bridging ties, that is, networks of people with

different political opinions and backgrounds, are crucial determinants of pol-
itical participation (e.g., Putnam, 2000). However, other research finds that
political diversity in social networks can have a dampening, rather than mobi-
lizing effect (e.g., McClurg, 2006).
This article attempts to reevaluate the effects of diverse political networks
by showing that politically hostile opinion environments do not necessarily
discourage participation. As has been argued before, hostile opinion environ-
ments might have a negative effect on participatory behavior because people
fear that such disagreement threatens social relationships and social harmony.
Based on this theorizing, it can be expected that generalized social trust--as a
fundamental pillar of all social and interpersonal behavior--serves as a catalyst
in such situations. Social trust refers to our expectations about how others
generally behave and react in social situations (Luhmann, 1979). When an
individual generally puts low trust in others, she/he will expect that others
will react in negative ways when they are faced with dissent. In contrast, when
someone scores high on social trust, she/he will not expect that others react
negatively to dissent. It follows that, compared with high trust individuals,
individuals low in generalized social trust may be less willing to participate
when confronted with dissimilar political networks.
Two studies demonstrate that, in fact, hostile opinion networks decrease
participation only for individuals who score low on generalized social trust.
Study 1 finds that individual differences in social trust moderate the relation-
ship between hostile opinion networks and political participation. Study 2
replicates these findings and additionally addresses the mechanism behind
social trust. In a mediated moderation model, it is shown that trust leads to
positive expectations about how others will react to dissent. These expect-
ations, then, interact with the exposure to hostile opinion networks in explain-
ing participation.
The Consequences of Hostile Opinion Environments
Many scholars in political communication emphasize the importance of the
social environment in fostering the development of civic engagement. Social
networks are believed to encourage civic engagement (Putnam, 2000), affect
vote choice (e.g., Campus et al., 2008), or increase the awareness for oppos-
itional views (Nir & Druckman, 2008). However, it is not interaction per se
that matters to political participation but also the characteristics of this inter-
action. Social environments can vary in their strengths (i.e., strong or weak
ties) and the sorts of people that interact. People can have a different religion,
race, educational background, and, of course, political opinions. One question
within this line of research, therefore, is if politically diverse opinion networks
can harm or foster political participation.

The term hostile opinion environment refers to the extent to which people's
social networks expose them to political views different from their own. Some
scholars find evidence that hostile environments tend to depress political par-
ticipation (McClurg, 2006; Mutz, 2002). This demobilizing effect is usually
explained in two ways (see McClurg, 2006; Mutz, 2002; Nir, 2005): First,
according to the political ambivalence explanation, networks that challenge in-
dividuals' views are likely to induce attitudinal ambivalence. This ambivalence,
in turn, causes individuals to become uncertain of their own position which
makes them less likely to take political action. Second, the social accountability
explanation holds that adverse political networks discourage political partici-
pation because individuals are afraid to set their social relations at stake. Thus,
they refrain from participation to maintain social harmony. Also beyond the
political realm, more heterogeneous networks in terms of education, income,
or race have been found to decrease various forms of participatory behavior
such as social activities (e.g., Alesina & La Ferrara, 2000), membership in
voluntary associations (Popielarz & McPherson, 1995; Rotolo, 2000), or col-
lective action (Varughese & Ostrom, 2001).
Other studies suggest that hostile opinion environments have no or even a
positive effect on participatory outcomes. In an early study, Berelson, Lazarsfeld,
and McPhee (1954) found no effect of general cross-pressures on voting. Other
more recent studies came to the conclusion that perceived disagreement within
discussion networks does not have a negative impact on voting turnout
(Huckfeldt, Ikeda, & Pappi, 2005; Rojas, 2008). Yet other studies showed that
heterogeneous discussion networks can also have a positive effect on various
forms of participation (Kwak, Williams, Wang, & Lee, 2005; Pattie &
Johnston, 2009; Sotirovic & McLeod, 2001; Wojcieszak, Baek, & Delli Carpini,
2010; for hostile media surroundings, see Matthes, 2012; Rojas, 2010).
How can these contradicting findings be explained? Apparently, there are a
number of factors that help to explain when the relationship between hostile
opinion environments and participation turns out to be negative, positive, or
zero (see for several explanations McClurg, 2006; Mutz, 2002; Nir, 2005,
2011; Wojcieszak, 2009, 2011; Wojcieszak et al., 2010). As Huckfeldt et al.
2005 (p. 512) put it, ``the relationship between disagreement and engagement
is complex, and simple assertions that disagreement attenuates civic capacity
do not survive close scrutiny''. Thus, there is a need to look for moderating
variables that help to make sense of these seemingly disparate results
(Wojcieszak, 2011; Wojcieszak et al., 2010). As Wojcieszak et al. (2010) have
concluded, ``research concerned with the effects of political dissimilarity on
opinions or behaviors should more closely attend to individual characteristics'',
and not ``accounting for the various moderating effects may obscure the
existing complexity and result in inconsistent findings'' (p. 174). In this art-
icle, one such moderator is proposed, social trust.

Generalized Social Trust
Definitions of Trust and Social Trust
Trust is perhaps the most important mechanism in helping people deal with risk
and uncertainty (Barber, 1983; Cappella, 2002; see also Kohring & Matthes, 2007;
Luhmann, 1979; Seligman, 1997; Simmel, 1964). As Tsfati and Cappella (2003, p.
505) put it, ``trust has consequences in almost every aspect of social life'' (also see
Luhmann, 1979; Tsfati, 2004; Tsfati & Cappella, 2005). In fact, trust is ``one of
the distinguishing features of the human species'' that ``characterizes almost all
human social interactions'' (Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak, Fischbacher, & Fehr, 2005,
p. 675). By trusting, the complexity of the future is reduced; the trusting actor
(i.e., the trustee) acts as if the future only held certain possibilities (Kohring &
Matthes, 2007; Luhmann, 1979). Trust is always addressed to another social
actor. It expresses an expectation toward this actor which refers to a future
action, and is characterized by insufficient knowledge about the outcome of
this future action. That means, in the act of trusting the trusting actor does not
know whether his or her trust is warranted. Therefore, trust includes the aware-
ness of a certain risk. Both aspects, open future and perceived risk, are decisive for
trust situations.
Social trust, as one aspect of trust, is one of the most important charac-
teristics when explaining human behavior and human interaction (Luhmann,
1979). It can be defined as the ``perception that other people are, in general,
fair, trustworthy, and helpful'' (Cappella, 2002, p. 230). There are two broad
conceptualizations of generalized social trust. The first holds that trust is a
characteristic of individuals and there are interindividual differences in gen-
eralized social trust (Allport, 1961; Erikson, 1950; Rotter, 1967). According to
this view, social trust is part of a broader syndrome of personality (Couch,
Adams, & Jones, 1996; Jones & George, 1998; Uslaner, 1999, 2008). Uslaner
(1999, 2008) argues that trust is learned early in life, mainly from interactions
with parents. His analysis of American panel studies shows that individual
levels of interpersonal trust are among the most stable survey items over time
(Uslaner, 1999, 2008).
The second approach considers trust as a property of society rather than of
individuals (Putnam, 2000). According to this theorizing, levels of trust re-
ported in public opinion surveys are a good indicator of the trustworthiness
and health of the societies in which citizens live.
As we are not interested in phenomena at the society level but rather focus
on the individual psychological level, we understand social trust as a general-
ized predisposition of individuals (see Jones & George, 1998; Stack, 1978;
Uslaner, 1999, 2008). Thus, social trust refers to a generalized expectancy
on how others will treat us. As Stack (1978) puts it, some individuals trust
their beloved ones and strangers alike; others expect the worst from everyone
around them. These sorts of people have developed different levels of
I N TER N A TI O NA L J OU R N A L O F P U B L I C O P I N I ON R E S E A R C H
26
generalized social trust. This conception of trait­trust should not be confused
with state­trust. Put differently, if people are comparatively stable in their
generalized trait­trust over time, there can nevertheless be certain situations
(i.e., states) that evoke higher or lower levels of social trust.
Generalized Social Trust and Hostile Opinion Environments
According to Barber (1983), social trust describes the expectations that indi-
viduals have about social interactions. As one of those expectations, people
high in social trust expect others to have faith in and to show concern for the
trustee (Kasperson, Golding, & Tuler, 1992). As Coleman (1990) puts it from
a rational choice perspective, the trustee expects gains from social interactions
rather than losses. Now, in hostile opinion environments, such faith and con-
cern are relevant. When people are confronted with dissimilar political opin-
ions, they may experience a threat to their social relationships. This, in turn,
might make them more reluctant to engage in political actions. Hence, in
terms of trust theory, there is a perceived risk or uncertainty that others
will react in negative ways.1 It is exactly this feeling of uncertainty in
which social trust (as a trait) comes into play (Barber, 1983; Luhmann,
1979; Seligman, 1997; Simmel, 1964). Social trust determines how people
perceive this uncertainty. People high in social trust will generally assume
that voicing one's dissenting views will not lead to negative sanctions by
others. They trust in the capacity of others to accept dissent. In contrast,
people low in social trust tend to expect that others react with a lack of faith
in situations of opinion dissent, leading to withdrawal, decline of sympathy,
and other negative reactions.
Rephrased, when people are surrounded by a hostile opinion environment,
a subjective fear to lose social relationships within this environment is trig-
gered. Social trust, as an individual differences variable, explains the degree to
which individuals expect such negative consequences (Luhmann, 1979; Stack,
1978): Trusting people take the risk to participate even though their social
environment could react in negative ways. Such an understanding of social
1A similar theoretical argument has been made in spiral of silence theory (see Matthes, Morrison, &
Schemer, 2010; see also Noelle-Neumann, 1974;). If we consider opinion expression as a form of political
participation, then spiral of silence suggests that fear of interpersonal conflict inhibits participation.
However, there are some important differences. First, we focus on cross-cutting interpersonal networks,
not on perceptions of the majority or minority opinion climate. That is, it does not matter to the present
research whether people disagree on minority or majority positions. Hence, this article follows other studies
on network heterogeneity (e.g., Kwak et al., 2005; McClurg, 2006; Nir, 2005). Second, the present research
does not investigate mass-mediated opinion climate, a key pillar of spiral of silence theory. Third, spiral of
silence theory does not allow an assumption about social trust as an individual difference variable. Social
trust explains people's expectations about how others react to dissent in social networks. Spiral of silence
theory, in contrast, would generally assume that people fear to be isolated. Fourth, spiral of silence theory
conceptualizes willingness to speak out as the dependent variable. This research focuses on political par-
ticipation more generally. Willingness to speak out was not included in the participation index.

trust is also reflected in the more general nature of trust. According to
Fukuyama (1995, p. 26), trust is ``the expectation that arises within a com-
munity of regular, honest and cooperative behavior, based on commonly
shared norms''. By the same token, Tschannen-Moran and Hoy (2000,
p. 556) define trust as ``one's party's willingness to be vulnerable to
another party based on the confidence that the latter party is (a) benevolent,
(b) reliable, (c) competent, (d) honest and (e) open''.
To summarize, generalized social trust equips people with a set of behav-
ioral expectations toward others. That is, people varying in social trust do vary
in their beliefs about how others will react to dissent. If there is high social
trust, individuals generally expect that others would not react in negative ways
in the face of disagreement. In contrast, people who have a low or moderate
level of social trust expect others to react negatively in response to disagree-
ment; i.e., that they turn away and give up the social relationship. It follows:
H1: Social trust moderates the relationship between hostile opinion environments and
political participation. In contrast to people who score high on social trust, hostile en-
vironments will harm political participation activities for people who score low on social
trust.
Study 1
Study 1 employs data from ``Citizenship, Involvement, Democracy'' (CID, see
Howard, Gibson, & Stolle, 2005) survey, conducted between mid-May and
mid-July 2005. The survey includes in-person interviews with a representative
sample of 1,001 Americans (unweighted sample; age ranging from 17 to 99
years, M ¼ 52.38, SD ¼ 15.68; 44% male). The most recent birthday method
was used. The overall response rate for this study was 40.03% using AAPOR's
(2004) Response Rate #3 formula.
Measures
Dependent Variable. Political participation was measured with a summary
index. Participation is a concept formed by causal (formative) indicators, not
by effects (or reflective) indicators. Formative scales are used when a construct
is defined as a total score across all the items. That is, there is no underlying
construct that explains the correlations among those indicators. Each indicator
represents an independent dimension in its own right (see for this causal
indicator approach, McClurg, 2006; Sotirovic & McLeod, 2001).
Respondents were asked if (1 ¼ yes, 0 ¼ no) they engaged in the following
public activities during the past 12 months (M ¼ 1.05, SD ¼ 1.60): worked
in a political party or action group, worked for the campaign of a candidate
for office, worked in another political organization or association, worn or
I N TER N A TI O NA L J OU R N A L O F P U B L I C O P I N I ON R E S E A R C H

displayed a campaign badge/sticker, signed a petition, taken part in a lawful
public demonstration, forwarded electronic messages with political content, or
participated in political activities over the internet. Private activities were not
included. Reliability measured with the Kuder­Richardson estimate was suf-
ficient (KR-20 ¼ .74).
Focal Independent Variables. Hostile opinion climate was measured
with three items tapping exposure to disagreement (not incivility, for a similar
approach, see Parsons, 2010; Sotirovic & McLeod, 2001; Wojcieszak et al.,
2010). People were asked the same question with respect to (a) close friends
they had contact with in the past month, (b) people they interacted with in
their neighborhood, and (c), people they interacted with in their workplace (or
school, for respondents still going to school; or past job for respondents with-
out a job). Respondents answered to the question ``About how many of them:
Have different political views from yours?'' (1 ¼ ``none'' to 9 ¼ ``almost all'').
Since these three items can be used to describe the ``overall'' opinion hostility
that people experience, the three items are summed up to an index. A PCA
with oblique rotation proved one-dimensionality (explained variance: 61.42%).
Thus, an index was calculated ( ¼ .68; M ¼ 3.94, SD ¼ 1.30). In total, 62
respondents not answering one of those questions were treated as missing
cases.
Social trust was measured with three standard items, originally developed
by Rosenberg (1956). The items were ``Generally speaking, would you say that
most people can be trusted, or that you can't be too careful in dealing with
people?'', ``Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or are
they mostly looking out for themselves?'', and ``Do you think that most
people would try to take advantage of you if they got a chance or would
they try to be fair?''. Respondents were invited to place themselves on a
11-point rating scale. PCA with oblique rotation proved one-dimensionality
(explained variance: 68.58%), thus, a mean index was computed ( ¼ .76;
M ¼ 5.30, SD ¼ 1.93). To ease interpretation, social trust and opinion
climate were mean-centered (for critical discussion, see Hayes, Glynn &
Huge, 2012).
Controls. To avoid underspecified regression models, a number of stat-
istical controls were included. Beside some indispensable standard measures
such as sex (2 ¼ female, 1 ¼ male), age, highest completed education
(0 ¼ ``none'' to 6 ¼ ``postgraduate training''), socio-economic status (inter-
viewer assessment, ranging from 1 ¼ ``unskilled, unemployed'' to 4 ``upper,
middle class'') was included because it has been found to impact participation
(see e.g., Pattie & Johnston, 2009). Religiousness (``how religious would you
say you are?'', 0 ¼ ``not at all'' to 10 ``very religious''; M ¼ 6.09, SD ¼ 2.59)
was added because religious orientation has been found to be a central variable
in explaining political behavior (e.g., Layman, 1997).
H OS TI L E O P IN I O N EN VI RO NM E NT S 29
As another central variable that positively influences participation (see
Campus et al., 2008; McClurg, 2006; Mutz, 2002; Nir, 2011; Nir &
Druckman, 2008), respondents' interest in politics was added (``How inter-
ested would you say you are in politics'', 1 ¼ ``not at all'' to 4 ``very'';
M ¼ 2.24, SD ¼ 0.90). Moreover, strength of political ideology was controlled
(see McClurg, 2006; Nir, 2005, 2011; Nir & Druckman, 2008; Pattie &
Johnston, 2009). Respondents were asked, ``Would you call yourself a strong
(Republican/Democrat) or not a very strong (Republican/Democrat)?''
(1 ¼ ``strong'', 0 ¼ ``not very strong''). As a standard measure of conservative
ideology, people were asked to place themselves on a 10-point scale, ranging
from 0 ¼ ``extremely liberal'' to 10 ¼ ``extremely conservative'' (M ¼ 5.49,
SD ¼ 2.27). Following Sotirovic and McLeod (2001) exposure to political
TV news was included (``On an average weekday, how much time, if any,
is spent watching news or programs about politics and current events?'';
0 ¼ ``no time at all'' to 9 ¼ ``more than four hours''; M ¼ 3.67, SD ¼ 1.84).
Network size as a relevant variable for participation was also controlled. In
line with previous studies (e.g., Kwak et al., 2005), this was done with an
index of two questions (``How many close friends do you have?'', 1 ¼ ``none''
to 6 ``more than 20'', and ``How many adults in your neighborhood would you
know by name if you met them on the street?'' 1 ¼ ``none'' to 9 ¼ ``all'',
r ¼ .21, p < .001; M ¼ 3.86, SD ¼ 1.24).
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed with moderated regression including an interaction term
between social trust and exposure to a hostile opinion environment.
Participation clustered toward the lower bound of the scale, thus, negative
binominal regression was used (see Gardner, Mulvey, & Shaw, 1995).
Results
The results regarding the controls largely match with the findings of previous
research (e.g., Campus et al., 2008; Nir, 2005; Nir & Druckman, 2008). As can
be seen in Table I, higher educated individuals were more likely to participate
compared with lower educated individuals (b ¼ .17, p < .001). Socio-economic
status (b ¼ .20, p < .001), ideology strength (b ¼ .22, p < .01), TV exposure
(b ¼ .05, p < .05), and political interest (b ¼ .51, p < .001) were positively
related to participation. However, age, sex, conservative ideology, and network
size exerted no influence on the amount of political activities the respondents
engaged in.
More importantly, there were no significant effects of hostile opinion en-
vironments (b ¼ À.02, n.s.) and of social trust (b ¼ À.01, n.s.). Thus, there is
no simple, unmoderated relationship between exposure to hostile political
I N TER N A TI O NA L J OU R N A L O F P U B L I C O P I N I ON R E S E A R C H
30
opinion environments and participatory activities. As can be seen in Table I, a
significant interaction between both variables was present (b ¼ .03, p < .05).
The positive sign of the interaction term signals that exposure to hos-
tile opinion environments is more likely to foster participation for people
high in social trust compared with people low in social trust, and that
hostile opinion environments harm participation with decreasing levels of
trust.
The interaction led to a significant increase of .002% (p < .05) of the
adjusted Pseudo R. To interpret the interaction, it was probed (see Bauer &
Curran, 2005; Hayes & Matthes, 2009). When the value for trust was smaller
than zero (on a mean-centered scale), the effect of hostile opinion environ-
ments on political participation was significantly (b ¼ À.13; p < .05) negative.
In contrast, for higher levels of social trust, no significant effect on political
participation was observed.

Discussion
Findings of Study 1 confirm the hypothesized moderating role of social trust.
However, Study 1 was unable to model the underlying mechanism of this
moderation. It was argued that social trust equips individuals with a set of
behavioral expectations about how others will react to dissenting opinions.
These behavioral expectations, in turn, determine whether or not individuals
engage in politics when confronted with a hostile opinion network. Behavioral
expectations, however, were not operationalized in Study 1. Thus, a second
study is needed to test the theorized mediated moderation scenario with hos-
tility as the independent variable and behavioral expectations being the mod-
erator that is predicted by trust. That is, for individuals that have negative
behavioral expectations (about how others will react to dissenting views, as a
result of trust), network hostility will decrease participation (see Figure 1).
Furthermore, as another drawback of Study 1, conflict avoidance was not
controlled for. Since Mutz (2002) found that conflict avoidance moderates the
effect of network hostility on participation, we need to demonstrate that the
moderating role of trust does not vanish once conflict avoidance is controlled
for. Thus, the aims of Study 2 were to replicate the findings of Study 1 in a
mediated moderation model and additionally controlling for a conflict avoid-
ance scale.
Study 2
A sample of 250 participants was drawn from an U.S. online access panel in
August 2010 (field-time: 24 August­27 August). The survey was programed
and administered by Survey Sampling International. The response rate was
RR1 ¼ .03. The survey took $5 min to complete. Participants were given an
incentive by the polling company in exchange for their participation. A quota
sampling method was used to obtain a sample identical to the general U.S.
population in terms of gender, age, and education. In total, 13 respondents
aged <18 years were excluded (age ranging from 18 to 87 years, M ¼ 44.84,
SD ¼ 16.80; 50% male).
Measures
Most measures were identical to Study 1. Political participation was measured
with a summary index of the same eight public participation activities during
the past 12 months (M ¼ 0.90, SD ¼ 1.41; KR-20 ¼ .72). Hostile opinion cli-
mate was measured with the same three items (for a similar approach, see
Parsons, 2010; Sotirovic & McLeod, 2001). A PCA with oblique rotation
proved one-dimensionality ( ¼ .82; M ¼ 3.76, SD ¼ 1.64). In total, 19 re-
spondents did not answer these questions and were treated as missing cases.
Also, social trust was measured with the same three standard items as in Study
I N TER N A TI O NA L J OU R N A L O F P U B L I C O P I N I ON R E S E A R C H

1. PCA proved one-dimensionality (explained variance: 78.23%), thus, a mean
index was computed ( ¼ .86; M ¼ 4.91, SD ¼ 2.17). Behavioral expectations
about how others generally react to dissent were measured with two items,
``It's okay to disagree with friends on politics; they wouldn't turn their backs
on you because of that'', and ``Most people would not hold it against you if
you disagreed with them on something''. When entered into a PCA together
with the three social trust items, the two items formed an independent factor
(25.11% explained variance) with no substantial cross-loadings. Thus, an
index was created ( ¼ .54, r ¼ .37, p < .001; M ¼ 3.44, SD ¼ .84). Again, to
ease interpretation, behavioral expectations and network hostility were
mean-centered.
The same controls as in Study 1 were operationalized (if not mentioned
otherwise all on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5): sex (2 ¼ female, 1 ¼ male),
age, highest education (1 ¼ ``some high school'' to 7 ¼ ``doctorate, law or pro-
fessional degree''), socio-economic status (``I am satisfied with my income'',
M ¼ 2.12, SD ¼ 1.16), interest in politics (``I am interested in politics'',
M ¼ 2.92, SD ¼ 1.33), strength of political ideology (respondents that scored
4 or 5 either on ``I am a strong democrat'', or on ``I am a strong republican'',
47.3%), conservative ideology (``I am a strong republican'', M ¼ 2.22,
SD ¼ 1.47), exposure to political news (index of ``I frequently watch television
to stay informed about politics'' and ``I frequently read a newspaper to stay
informed about politics'';  ¼ .74, r ¼ .59, p < .001; M ¼ 2.69, SD ¼ 1.25), and
network size (two items as in Study 1,  ¼ .44, r ¼ .30, p < .001; M ¼ 3.17,
SD ¼ 1.27). Conflict avoidance was measured with three items similar to Mutz
(2002) (``I try to avoid getting into political discussions because they can be
unpleasant'', ``I don't like conflict when discussing with someone about pol-
itics'', ``I am sometimes reluctant to talk about politics because I don't like
arguments'', one-dimensional index, 72.75% explained variance,  ¼ .81,
M ¼ 3.40, SD ¼ 1.01). When entered into a PCA, social trust, behavioral ex-
pectations, and conflict avoidance formed three distinct factors with no
cross-loadings. Behavioral expectations was unrelated to conflict avoidance
(r ¼ À.09 p ¼ .17)
Data Analysis
A mediated moderation model using Mplus was estimated. The relationship
between hostility and participation was moderated by behavioral expectations,
whereas the latter was explained by trust. More technically, the moderating
effect of trust was mediated by expectations (Figure 1). Behavioral expect-
ations--as a continuous variable--was modeled with OLS regression, partici-
pation--a count variable--was modeled with negative binominal regression.

Results
As Table I indicates, social trust had a significant positive effect on behavioral
expectations about how others will react to dissent (b ¼ .07, p < .01). Similar to
Study 1, participation was explained by education (b ¼ .16, p < .001) and pol-
itical interest (b ¼ .50, p < .001). Most germane to the main hypothesis, the
interaction between network hostility and behavioral expectations was signifi-
cant (b ¼ .14, p < .01). The interaction led to a significant .01% (p < .01)
increase of the adjusted Pseudo R (Table I). There were again no main effects
of network hostility and behavioral expectations. The positive sign of this
interaction again signals that hostile opinion networks might weaken partici-
pation with decreasing levels of positive expectations. In fact, further probing
revealed that network hostility decreases participation (b ¼ À.73, p < .05) when
behavioral expectations about how others react to dissent were below À.5 on a
mean-centered scale. In contrast, there was no effect of network hostility when
individuals scored higher than this value. Thus, trust fueled behavioral ex-
pectations, and these, in turn, interacted with network hostility to explain
participation.
To estimate the conditional indirect effect of network hostility on partici-
pation (through positive expectations, predicted by social trust) a product
coefficient approach was applied (MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams,
2004). The conditional indirect effect was marginally significant (Goodman
test z ¼ 1.95, p ¼ .05; Sobel test z ¼ 1.88, p ¼ .06). As can be seen in Table I,
the direct effects of trust and network hostility on participation were not
significant (b ¼ À.03, n.s.). Thus, hostility was only relevant to participation
when there were negative behavioral expectations as a result of trust.
In an additional analysis, the same covariates that were used to explain
participation were added to predict behavioral expectations. As a result, the
effect of trust on behavioral expectations slightly decreased (b ¼ .06, p < .05)
but was still significant. However, since there were no theoretical grounds to

include all those different controls--like it was the case for participation--the
controls were not included in the model shown in Table I.
Furthermore, a different model was tested. Network hostility was
theorized to interact with trust on its effect on behavioral expectations. The
idea was that behavioral expectations might be more positive for high trust
individuals when confronted with a hostile opinion network than for low
trust individuals. However, this was not the case: There was no signifi-
cant interaction between trust and hostility (b ¼ À.01, n.s.), and no main
effect of hostility (b ¼ À.03, n.s.). All other effects shown in Table I remained
constant.
To directly replicate the results yielded in Study 1, an additional analysis
employed trust in exchange for behavioral expectations. It was expected, like
in Study 1, that trust interacts with network hostility to explain participation.
However, although the interaction effect pointed in the expected direction, it
did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (b ¼ .02, n.s.).2
A final model tested if the relationship between hostile opinion networks
and participation was moderated by conflict avoidance (see Mutz, 2002; Ulbig
& Funk, 1999). It could be theorized that especially conflict avoidant people
refrain from participation in the face of politically diverse others. However,
there was no such two-way interaction when tested in an additional model
(b ¼ .01, n.s.).
Discussion
Study 2 confirms the reasoning behind Study 1. Hostile opinion networks
harm participation when people score low on generalized social trust. The
reason is that social trust determines behavioral expectations about how
others will behave when they are confronted with politically dissimilar opin-
ions. Another aim of Study 2 was to control for conflict avoidance with a
reliable index of three items. It was found that the trust process theorized in
this article is independent from conflict avoidance.
General Discussion
This article argued that the relationship between hostile opinion environments
and political participation is moderated by individuals' level of generalized
social trust. Trust was conceptualized as a personality trait that tends to be
2Although this finding may seem puzzling, it is important to note that this is not necessarily a contra-
diction to Study 1. There can be a mediated effect even when there is no main or direct effect (see Hayes,
2009). Like in Study 1, trust had an impact on the relationship between network hostility and participation.
In Study 1, this effect was unmediated; in Study 2, this effect was fully mediated by behavioral expecta-
tions. One reason for this difference might be the smaller sample size in Study 2 dampening the explanatory
power of trust.

relatively stable over time, and is predictive of trust-relevant social interactions
across situations. Study 1 demonstrated that low trust individuals refrain from
participation when confronted with a hostile opinion network. Study 2 pro-
vided further evidence for this effect by unraveling the mechanism behind this
process. Social trust moderates the effect of network hostility on participation
because it fuels people's expectations about how network members react to
dissent. When individuals assume (because of their generalized social trust
beliefs) that others react in negative ways, when confronted with dissimilar
political opinions, participation in hostile opinion environments will be
thwarted.
Findings of both studies are in line with the social accountability explan-
ation holding that hostile networks discourage participation because individ-
uals are afraid to set their social relations at stake (see Mutz, 2002). The key
insight of both studies is: Not all individuals are equally involved in this
process. People who are generally high in social trust have no expectations
that opinion deviance sets social relations at stake. In short, they just do not
see the danger of voicing dissenting viewpoints. This process is conceptually
and empirically different from conflict avoidance which was controlled for in
both studies. Conflict avoidance, as an individual difference variable, can be
described as an internal motivation to avoid all situations involving conflict.
Generalized social trust, in contrast, explains individuals' expectations whether
or not opinion deviance will cause conflicts and negative sanctions by the
social network. Rephrased, trust explains individuals' generalized expectations
about how others will behave and react. In fact, conflict avoidance and social
trust were only weakly correlated (Study 2: r ¼ À.14, p < .05). It follows that
there can be people that are high in social trust and nevertheless very conflict
avoidant. Likewise, there can be people who generally tend to seek conflicts
but score very low on generalized social trust measures. However, it was
beyond the scope of this article to address the political ambivalence explan-
ation which holds that hostile networks induce attitudinal ambivalence which,
in turn, hampers political action. Ambivalence is mostly operationalized with
respect to two candidates or a policy issue (see Mutz, 2002). The measures
used in this study, in contrast, generalize about several policy issues.
Furthermore, it should also be stated that the results herein--specifically in
regard to conflict avoidance--are not directly comparable to Mutz (2002)
because network hostility was measured as a subjective assessment and not
by a name generator method.
Further data analysis revealed that generalized social trust and exposure to
hostile opinion networks were positively related in Study 1 (r ¼ .14, p < .001),
albeit not significantly in Study 2 (r ¼ .16, p ¼ .12). Thus, there was a (mar-
ginal) relationship between the focal independent variable and the moderator.
One might argue that trust impacts exposure to network hostility, which in
I N TER N A TI O NA L J OU R N A L O F P U B L I C O P I N I ON R E S E A R C H
36
turn influences participation. However, there was no main effect of network
hostility on participation in both studies. Thus, the unique role of trust lies in
its interaction with network hostility (through its impact on behavioral expect-
ations). Put in more abstract terms, a relationship between trust and network
hostility does by no means imply that the effect of trust on the relationship
between hostility and participation is spurious.
Implications
Since in most Western countries politics is largely confrontational and polar-
ized, cross pressures are very common in the course of campaigns, both in the
mass-mediated (see Matthes, 2012; Nir & Druckman, 2008) and in the inter-
personal realm (see Mutz, 2002). Thus, the question of how people react in such
situations is central to many communication processes as well as to the field at
large. In line with other recent research (Wojcieszak, 2011; Wojcieszak et al.,
2010), findings of the present two studies suggest that the relationship between
cross-pressures and participation is more complex than generally acknowledged.
In fact, it was not found that disagreement has a negative impact on participa-
tory behavior ``for all'' citizens. Only some individuals, however--those who
generally put less trust in others--are susceptible to this process.
For democracy, this is, of course, good news. Based on the findings of the
present research, we cannot say that disagreement harms participation per se.
On the contrary, disagreement is an important part of democratic behavior.
However, people need to develop skills to deal with such disagreement. These
skills are learned over one's life span and can be positively influenced, espe-
cially in early childhood and in political socialization. That is, according to
personality theory, generalized trust is especially built in early years in life. As
Uslaner (2004) puts it, ``how much one trusts others as a child largely deter-
mines how much one trusts others as an adult'' (p. 240). Democratic societies
that are high in generalized social trust (and therefore social capital), do not
need to fear disagreement as a danger to the functioning of democracy.
Combined with the findings of the present research, these insights point
somehow to the importance of (non)political socialization in explaining citi-
zens' political engagement. Political participation does not start with the eli-
gibility to vote but in infancy when children learn from their close interactions
that the generalized other can be trusted.
Finally, the role of trust in building a healthy democracy is--as all trust
processes (Luhmann, 1979)--twofold. Social trust fosters participation not
only through a higher likelihood of the trustee to engage in politics when
confronted with disagreement, but also through a lower likelihood of the
trusted to betray this trust. Put differently, if those that receive trust in dis-
similar opinion environments do share a trusting attitude, they are also more
likely to respond to disagreement in positive ways, that is, to cherish social
H OS TI L E O P IN I O N EN VI RO NM E NT S 37
bonds. Thus, if both sides of a trust relation are high in generalized trust,
trust will be paid back to the trustee.
Limitations and Future Research
There are limitations to this study that are worthy of careful consideration.
First, it might be argued that the measure of network hostility that was used
in both studies is a self-perceptual measure and thus prone to subjective biases
(for a discussion, see Wojcieszak et al., 2010). Although such biases cannot
entirely be ruled out, several variables that might impact perceptual bias (e.g.,
ideology strength, political interest, conflict avoidance) were controlled for in
both studies. Furthermore, perceptual hostility measures are quite established
in the literature (e.g., Parsons, 2010; Sotirovic & McLeod, 2001, Wojcieszak
et al., 2010). Nevertheless, a validation of these findings with nonperceptual
measures is needed.
Second, and more importantly, cross-sectional studies are unable to tackle the
problem of causality. If trust serves as a moderator between heterogeneous pol-
itical networks and participation, does generalized trust also depend on hetero-
geneous political networks, and does political participation also lead to more trust
in generalized others? Many scholars in political communication have pointed to
this rather severe chicken-and-egg problem in regard to a number of research
fields. Ultimately, panel studies or elaborate experimental settings are needed to
resolve this issue. However, it can be argued with leading theorists in the field of
generalized trust that there is a rather stable interindividual variance in trust
behaviors that cannot be explained by contextual factors (Uslaner, 1999).
Related to that, we have treated trust as a trait-like concept. The findings
herein should be replicated with state-oriented measures, perhaps in experimental
designs. This would help to understand the amount of variance that can be ex-
plained by state versus trait factors in this process.
Third, as common in research involving large survey data and a number of
significant controls, the effect of the interaction terms were rather small in both
studies, though statistically significant and meaningful. One reason for that might
be that trust was measured with regard to generalized others. More specific trust
measures and especially state-like measures, i.e., in regard to individuals' existing
social networks, might exert larger effects. A related drawback is that respondents
were not asked with respect to a policy issue or candidate, the questions generally
referred to political disagreement across time and issues. It can be assumed that
effects will be stronger when working with issue-specific measures. Related to
that, it is important to note that the present research did not investigate partici-
pation in an election context. Participation was measured with respect to people's
nonvoting activities in the past 12 months. Replication of these findings in an
election context is therefore warranted.

Finally, a few controls were tapped with single items. Although some of them
are standard measures (i.e., political interest), standardized and validated scales
would provide more reliable results. However, for all key dependent and inde-
pendent measures, reliable multi-item scales were used. Still, behavioral expect-
ations were operationalized with only two items that were moderately reliable,
though it should be noted that reliability increases with a rising number of items.
Moreover, one item of the behavioral expectations measure referred to ``friends'',
the other to ``most people''. Clearly, these items tap different facets of behavioral
expectations and thus they are not equally valid for all social networks.
Future research should not only attempt to replicate the present findings,
but also strive to apply more elaborate longitudinal designs or experimental
settings. Especially, experiments could help to model the causal mechanisms in
response to hostile opinion environments. Even though social trust can be
understood as an individual difference variable, trust attitudes could be trig-
gered in sound experimental settings. That is, by providing trust cues, gen-
eralized social trust--and as a consequence behavioral expectations--could be
manipulated. Then, it could be observed how people react when they are
confronted with politically dissimilar networks.
More central to the general literature on political disagreement and par-
ticipation, future studies should aim for a more extensive understanding of
several mechanisms that hamper or foster participation. In this study, the
focus was on interpersonal disagreement and social trust. The combined effects
of interpersonal disagreement and mass-mediated cross-pressures (see
Noelle-Neumann, 1974) in explaining political participation deserve more
scholarly attention (see Matthes, 2012). This could demonstrate whether the
mechanisms leading to participation and political withdrawal are similar in
these contexts or tell different stories.
