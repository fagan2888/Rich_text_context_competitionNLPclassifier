The historical and stigmatizing view of mental illness as a
mysterious and rare condition has evolved and, presently, is
now accurately seen as a more common occurrence. Much of
our society has become more knowledgeable about identify-
ing symptoms and more willing to seek help from mental
health professionals; we are gradually becoming more sensi-
tive to the fact that mental health and mental illness can be
everyday family issues. At the same time, however, the way
in which individual families experience and cope with men-
tally unhealthy members can vary greatly based on family
demographic variables. That is, ethnicity can have a signifi-
cant impact on how families perceive and treat mental ill-
nesses, and there is a need to increase our limited
understanding of mental health/illness issues among ethnic
and immigrant families (Takeuchi, Alegria, Jackson, & Wil-
liams, 2007). Some work has been done to identify links
between research variables among ethnic samples in the
United States (Mossakowski, 2007; Perez, Fortuna, &
Alegria, 2008; Takeuchi, Alegria, et al., 2007), yet plausible
explanations for existing findings and/or theoretical models
have yet to be presented. The purpose of this article will be
to discuss research findings using theABC-X Model of Fam-
ily Stress to highlight unique stressors, resources, and per-
ceptions that should be considered when studying how ethnic
families understand and seek treatment for mental health
issues. Future areas of research, and ideas for programmatic
and policy initiatives will also be presented.
The ABC-X Model of Family Stress
and Ethnic Families
Family stress research has a history dating back nearly a
century (Hill, 1949), and current family scholars continue to
refine the family stress model (Boss, 2002) and expand the
application of the theoretical perspective to a variety of fam-
ily transitions and circumstances (Price, Price, & McKenry,
2010). The theory proposes that
A (the provoking or stressor event of sufficient magni-
tude to result in chance in a family)-interacting with B
(the family's resources or strengths)-interacting with C
(the definition or meaning attached to the event by the
family)-produces X (stress or crisis). (Price, Price, &
McKenry, 2010, p. 6)

Ethnic Families and Mental Health:
Application of the ABC-X Model
of Family Stress
Angie M. Schock-Giordano1
Abstract
Mental health and well-being has become an increasingly important social concern today, and the manner in which families
perceive and respond to mentally ill family members is often directly linked to symptom management and treatment outcomes.
There has been a limited amount of research focusing on non-Caucasian families' mental health concerns, yet some emerging
evidence suggests that ethnicity may play a role in a variety of ways.The purpose of this article will be to apply the ABC-X
Model of Family Stress to organize the research on ethnic families and mental health issues. In particular, occurrence of the
stressor of mental illness among ethnic families, family resources that may be most relevant to ethnic families, and research
highlighting the unique ways in which ethnic families may perceive mental health and illness conditions will be discussed. In
addition, future research directions to better understand the interaction between ethnic families and mental health, as well
as programmatic and policy initiatives that can address potential family, community, and large-scale social obstacles in seeking
treatment will be presented.

The stressor can be classified using multiple dimensions
(e.g., chronic or acute, normative or nonnormative), may be
considered a positive or negative event, and will change
some form of the family system. Many different family
experiences have been discussed within the context of the
ABC-X Model, such as divorce (Fine, Ganong, & Demo,
2010), financial hardship (Bartholomae & Fox, 2010), death
(Murray, Toth, Larsen, & Moulton, 2010), and family vio-
lence (Gelles, 2010).
In their chapter on mental illness and family stress,
Schock-Giordano and Gavazzi (2010) noted that "society is
also becoming more sensitive to the fact that mental health
and mental illness are family issues as well as individual
concerns" and that "understanding the impact of daily stress-
ors and the ways in which individuals and family members
cope with stress are topics that must be integrated into any
discussion of mental illness" (p. 163). Therefore, they apply
the family stress theory and the ABC-X Model to review the
most recent research on the epidemiology and etiology of
mental illness, as well as the assessment of family resources
and community-based resources. However, these authors
note that there is far less information regarding ethnic indi-
viduals and their families, and that
research is needed to identify reasons for lower mental
illness rates among non-Caucasians in the United
States and what role certain protective factors such as
ethnic identity, religiosity, lifestyle choices and cul-
tural values might have in contributing to mental
health. (Schock-Giordano & Gavazzi, 2010, p. 169)
How can theABC-X Model of Family Stress (Boss, 2002)
be used to frame the discussion of ethnic families' experi-
ences of mental illness? By applying this useful theoretical
model, "A" refers to the stressor event, which would be the
family member's mental illness. Thus, it will be relevant to
discuss the number of ethnic families in the United States
who are affected by mental illness, as well as research related
to the causes of mental illness that might be unique to many
non-Caucasian families. The "B" factor represents available
resources that can exist within the individual, within the
family system, and within the community. Hence, it will be
valuable to identify family strengths that are characteristic of
ethnic families that can aid in the treatment of mental ill-
nesses. Also, community resources that exist for families
coping with mental illness, such as treatment programs,
community-based organizations, web-based support sys-
tems, and social policy efforts must be evaluated in consider-
ation of particular barriers that might exist for ethnic families.
The "C" element in the family stress theory model refers to
the family's perceptions of mental illness, recognizing that
the family members' views of mental illness translate into
behaviors and attitudes that have a direct impact on the well-
being of mentally ill family members. For instance, the
stigma that is attached to mental illness can be strongly
influenced by cultural and family belief systems, and these
views affect the manner in which family members show sup-
port to the mentally ill family member and display flexibility
in seeking nonfamilial treatment for the mental illness.
A: Mental Illnesses in Ethnic Families
The "A" element in the ABC-X Model represents the
stressor. According to the ABC-X Model, and borrowing
from family systems theory (Smith, Hamon, Ingoldsby, &
Miller, 2009; White & Klein, 2002), mental illness will not
only affect an individual, but it will also have an impact on
his or her family members. What do we know about the
overall occurrence of mental illness in this country? Current
patterns of mental illness in the U.S. population can be esti-
mated by using available information about the incidence
and prevalence of various disorders. Several large-scale
studies have been conducted in the United States to provide
estimations of the most current mental illness rates, such as
the National Institute of Mental Health's Epidemiological
Catchment Area Study (Regier, Burke, & Burke, 1990) and
the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R;
Kessler et al., 1994). Using the 2004 census data, it is esti-
mated that nearly 56 million people in the United States will
experience a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year
(National Institute of Mental Health, 2008).
However, there have only been a few recent large-scale
studies that have focused on collecting ethnic data; hence,
the limited information that is available concerning mental
illness rates among various ethnic groups in the United
States is based on very few national epidemiological studies.
For instance, the NCS-R collected data from Latinos and
African Americans, but the sample was limited to English-
speaking Latinos and did not disaggregate data among
Latinos based on important factors such as immigration sta-
tus or country of origin (Alegria et al., 2008). The National
Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) gathered data
from a sample of 2,554 Latinos and 2,095 Asian Americans
related to prevalence of mental illness disorders and mental
health treatment/service usage in the United States. The sam-
ple was stratified into ethnic subgroup categories (e.g.,
Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, Other Latinos, Chinese,
Vietnamese, Filipino, and Other Asians) to allow for within-
ethnic-group comparisons (Center for Multicultural Mental
Health Research, 2008). Data from these recent studies sug-
gest that many mental disorder rates are lower for most eth-
nic groups compared with Caucasians (Alegria et al., 2008;
Breslau et al., 2006; Kessler et al., 2005). Specifically,
Latinos and African Americans had lower rates of internal-
izing disorders (e.g., anxiety disorder, depression, social
phobia) and some externalizing disorders (e.g., oppositional-
defiant disorder, impulse control disorders) than did
Caucasians (Breslau et al., 2006).
Data on mental illness rates for Asian Americans, how-
ever, appear to be inconsistent and complex, and depend on
Schock-Giordano 3
factors such as gender, nativity, generation status, and
English-language proficiency (Takeuchi, Zane, et al., 2007).
Furthermore, among Latinos, mental illness rates have been
found to be lower for non-U.S. born Latinos versus those
born in the United States (Grant et al., 2004; Takeuchi,
Alegria, et al., 2007). These findings suggest that, in some
way, immigrants' assimilation into American culture may
have a deleterious effect on mental health, although exactly
how so remains unclear. In addition, when within group
comparisons among Latinos were investigated, differences
emerged based on country of origin, such that Mexicans
were at higher risk for anxiety and depressive disorder com-
pared with Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and other Latinos (Alegria
et al., 2008). Thus, it will be imperative to consider impor-
tant ethnic group variables, such as generation status and
birth country, when conducting studies of immigrants who
have and have not been born and raised in the United States.
In addition, although these current rates present a positive
outlook for many ethnic families, it still will be valuable to
further understand potential causes of mental illness that
may be uniquely related to ethnicity, such as economic hard-
ship, assimilation challenges, and social injustices (Grant et
al., 2004; Takeuchi, Alegria, et al., 2007).
B: Resources
According to the Model of Family Stress, resources can
exist at the individual, family, and community levels
(McCubbin & Patterson, 1985). Resources will contribute to
the "X" or outcome in the ABC-X Model, such that the exis-
tence and utilization of resources at multiple levels will
always relate to how families experience a stressor. Thus, to
further examine the possible reasons for lower mental illness
rates among non-Caucasians in the United States, future
research should consider the way in which these variables,
such as factors related to immigration, act as resources or
protective factors that might contribute to the mental health
of ethnic families. For instance, some findings have shown
that ethnic identity (e.g., sense of ethnic pride, cultural com-
mitment to an ethnic group, involvement in ethnic practices)
hasbeenrelatedtofewerdepressedsymptoms(Mossakowski,
2003). Similarly, several studies involving foreign-born and
U.S.-born Latinos (Grant et al., 2004; Vega et al., 1998) and
Filipinos (Mossakowski, 2007) have found that foreign-born
ethnic members have a lower risk of mental illness than
U.S.-born ethnicities. Based on these findings, it appears
that adhering to one's traditional family culture and having
a strong sense of personal ethnic identity serve as protective
factors against mental illness.
Protective factors can also be available through many
types of formal and informal social networks. In fact, in a
sample of Mexican migrant farmers, high levels of reported
instrumental support (e.g., financial and transportation assis-
tance) and emotional social support (providing comfort
when needed) were related to lower rates of depressive
symptoms (Alderete, Vega, Kolody, & Aguilar-Gaxiola,
1999). Research has also shown that residing in an ethnically
alike community can also serve as a protective factor, in that
living in a neighborhood that is populated with those who
share one's cultural background may translate into a greater
number of local social networks (Eschbach, Ostir, Patel,
Markides, & Goodwin, 2004; Perez et al., 2008).
Clearly, there is a need to specifically investigate the way
in which some protective factors, which are common among
many ethnic families, are related to rates of mental illness.
For instance, how influential is the strong emotional, psy-
chological, and financial support from immediate and
extended family members that is characteristic of many eth-
nic and immigrant families' cultural value systems in main-
taining mental health? What role do factors such as
socioeconomic status, location of residence, age at immigra-
tion, and community support play in mediating the relation-
ship between ethnicity and mental health?
C: Family Perceptions
In the ABC-X Model of Family Stress, perceptions are criti-
cal in determining the eventual impact of the stressor on the
family because they are important in understanding how a
family assesses the magnitude of a stressor, and also how the
family assesses the availability and utility of internal and
external resources. When focusing on non-White families in
the United States, there may be some particular types of
perceptions that are more common among ethnic families
and that are also related to how the family copes with
stressor events, such as perceived discrimination and the
stigma associated with mental illness.
It has been estimated that prevalence rates of discrimina-
tion experiences among Latinos and African Americans are
at 38% and 53%, respectively (Stuber, Galea, Ahern, Blaney,
& Fuller, 2003), and findings have shown that perceived dis-
crimination (e.g., self-reported experiences of everyday
unfair treatment) has been linked to the mental health of eth-
nic families living in the United States. Specifically, discrim-
inatory practices, in the form of job inequalities, inadequate
mental health, and lack of community supports have been
related to elevated depression rates in a sample of Mexican-
origin adults (Finch, Hummer, Kol, & Vega, 2009), and an
increase in perceived discrimination over time was related to
higher rates of depressive symptoms and poorer general
health among African American females compared with
Caucasian women (Schulz et al., 2000). Research also shows
that ethnic identification is related to less perceived discrimi-
nation, suggesting that "people with high levels of ethnic
identity may be more likely to associate with people of their
own ethnicity and therefore be less exposed to discrimina-
tion" (Perez et al., 2008, p. 430). Disentangling the associa-
tion between perceptions of self, perceptions of stressors
(e.g., discrimination), and mental health will be a valuable
direction for further research.
4 SAGE Open
The perceived stigma of mental illness that families
experience can have negative psychological consequences
for the mentally unhealthy individual, such as lower self-
esteem levels, reduced social contacts, job loss, and family
relationship difficulties (Mittleman, 1985; Wahl & Harman,
1989). Research shows that ethnic families may be more
concerned about stigma related to mental illness than Whites
(Cooper-Patrick et al., 1997). For instance, in a qualitative
study in which participants responded to vignettes about
mentally ill (i.e., schizophrenia) persons, non-Caucasians
were more likely to report less pity for the individual's
health condition and also perceive the condition of mental
illness to be more dangerous than did Caucasians (Corrigan
& Watson, 2007). Also, a sample of depressed African
Americans and Latinos were significantly more likely to
site social barriers (e.g., embarrassment of disclosing the
mental health problem and worry that one's employer would
find out) as reasons to not seek treatment when compared
with Caucasians (Ojeda & McGuire, 2006). Other similar
findings have shown that in a sample of Asian American
college students, the less acculturated students were more
likely to exhibit more stigmatized attitudes toward seeking
professional psychological assistance (Atkinson & Gim,
1989); again, it will be important to examine the relative
impact that level of acculturation has on ethnic families and
their mental health.
Why Does the Stigma of Mental
Illness Seem to Have a Greater
Impact on Ethnic Families?
Reflecting on their findings involving Asian American col-
lege students, Atkinson and Gim (1989) proposed,
It may be that some of the values common across these
ethnicities (e.g., fear of bringing shame to the family,
submergence of individuality, somatization of symp-
toms, self control to resolve problems, restraint of
strong feelings, and respect for authority) account for
the similar pattern across ethnicities of attitudes
toward professional psychological help. (p. 211)
In other words, a high value for self-reliance, a trait that is
characteristic of many ethnic families, actually contributes to
a negative view of mental illness by implying a weakness;
thus, individuals in the family do not want to admit to having
mental health problems, and the family does not allow for
nonfamilial persons to become aware of or help with any
mental illnesses that may exist within the family system
(Ortega & Alegria, 2002). In addition, a negative perception
could exist because ethnic families, especially new immi-
grants who may have difficulty with English-language profi-
ciency, do not understand or feel comfortable accessing
services in the U.S. mental health system. These possible
considerations can be especially helpful in proposing future
community and policy initiatives.
Religion
Affiliation with a particular religion is a common character-
istic of many ethnicities in the United States: "Religious
involvement is a vital factor in some ethnic minority groups
that enables people to retain cultural roots in a dominant
society that holds different values" (King, Weich, Nazroo, &
Blizard, 2006, p. 161). When studying the way in which
religion can aid ethnic families in coping with stress, such as
a mental illness, some researchers have posited that a multi-
dimensional conceptualization of religion must be used
because religion can be helpful in a variety of ways.
Specifically, religion can manifest as (a) religious/spiritual
beliefs and faith in a higher power, (b) religious affiliation
and membership in religious communities, and (c) increased
social relationships and interactions through church atten-
dance (van Olphen et al., 2003). Interestingly, then, in the
context of the ABC-X Model, religion can be viewed as both
a resource (social supports, personal relationships) and a
perception (faith, a sense of belonging to a group and/or
purpose).
Religious beliefs and experiencing faith in a higher power
through prayer can serve as a barrier to mental illness among
ethnic families. For example, findings have shown that
Mexican families are more likely to use religion, faith, and
reframing as a coping mechanism compared with Caucasians
(Farley, Galves, Dickinson, & Perez, 2005), and frequency
of prayer has been linked to fewer self-reported depressive
symptoms in a sample of African American women (van
Olphen et al., 2003). Furthermore, in the same study of
African American women, frequency of church attendance
and reported feelings of social support from within the
church were also related to fewer self-reported depressive
symptoms. Ellison, Boardman, Williams, and Jackson (2001)
found mixed support for several theoretical models that were
tested in their study that linked ethnicity, religion, stress, and
mental health; hence, the authors conclude that future studies
should identify which types of religious involvement are
related to particular mental health outcomes. Further research
must provide a more clear understanding of the mechanisms
by which ethnicity, religion, and mental health are related.
X: Outcome and Implications
According to the family stress model, when families are
experiencing mental health problems, the result, which will
be a function of the stressor, resources, and perceptions, can
end in numerous positive and negative outcomes. For
instance, negative outcomes that families may experience
could include dealing with objective burdens (e.g., cost of
providing medical care, housing, insurance) and subjective
burdens (e.g., exhaustion, reduced social contacts, family
Schock-Giordano 5
stigma), whereas positive outcomes may involve enhanced
family relationships, caregiver satisfaction, and advocacy
efforts (Schock-Giordano & Gavazzi, 2010).
Additional positive outcomes that the mentally ill indi-
vidual might experience, such as adaptive coping strategies
and symptom management, certainly could be facilitated
through service use and treatment adherence, yet research
has shown that some ethnic groups report lower rates of
utilization of mental health services than do Caucasians
(Abe-Kim et al., 2007; Alegria et al., 2007; Hodgkin, Volpe-
Vartanian, & Alegria, 2007; Wang et al., 2005). It has been
estimated that "among Latinos with a diagnosable mental
health disorder, fewer than one in eleven contact a health
professional for treatment, compared with one of every three
non-Hispanic whites" and "the percentage of African
Americans receiving mental health services is only half that
of whites" (Alegria, Pérez, & Williams, 2003, p. 53). This
trend might be explained by inadequate family resources in
the form of financial issues (e.g., cost of care, poor insurance
coverage, loss of pay from work) and social issues (e.g., dis-
comfort with English-language fluency) that serve as signifi-
cant barriers to accessing mental health services for ethnic
families (Ojeda & McGuire, 2006). Another practical obsta-
cle to seeking services for ethnic families may be geographic
accessibility. In fact, in their study of mental health outpa-
tient recipients, Kouzumi, Rothbard, and Kuno (2009) found
that Latino and African American clients were not as likely
as Caucasians to travel a large distance for treatment, sug-
gesting that geographic proximity to care will be an impor-
tant issue to consider in ethnic communities. Furthermore,
the authors note that "variation in provider quality by geo-
graphic location appears to be one of the mechanisms that
may generate racial disparities in quality of care, given the
previous finding that poorer quality programs were found in
high minority, low income neighborhoods" (Kouzumi,
Rothbard, & Kunop, 2009, p. 430).
To better understand the many different barriers that exist
for ethnic families coping with mental illness, it also will be
necessary to study the important links between ethnic fami-
lies' perceptions of mental illness as a condition, such as
whether the issue will resolve on its own and expectations
about the effectiveness of treatment (Anglin, Alberti, Link, &
Phelan, 2008), especially since many ethnic families may seek
out and rely on nonprofessional help (e.g., extended family
members, religious leaders) to ameliorate their mental health
issues (Blank, Mahmood, Fox, & Guterbock, 2002). In addi-
tion, it will be helpful to further investigate the preferred
method of treatment for various mental illnesses among ethnic
families (Givens, Houston, Van Voorhees, Ford, & Cooper,
2007) and these families' satisfaction with received services.
When ethnic families do seek mental health care, how
well do existing interventions translate among and resonate
with families' various culturally specific values, needs, and
perspectives? In their comprehensive review of existing
mental health treatments, Miranda et al. (2005) examined the
efficacy of evidence-based treatments when serving ethnic
families to determine whether culturally enhanced treat-
ments should be developed. Their review suggested that
existing treatments are effective with ethnic individuals, yet
the authors contend that "protocols or guidelines that con-
sider culture and context with evidence-based care is likely
to facilitate engagement in treatment and probably to enhance
outcomes" (Miranda et al., 2005, p. 22). In addition, they
propose two important areas for future research for clinicians
and professionals working with culturally diverse popula-
tions; that is, researches need to (a) develop a method for
ensuring that interventions include the unique concerns and
needs of ethnic families and (b) develop strategies to encour-
age ethnicities to engage in available mental health care
options.
Major mental health system and public policy efforts are
needed to improve service delivery to ethnic families. For
instance, initiatives could include a more comprehensive
public awareness educational campaign that addresses symp-
toms, course, and treatment plans related to mental illnesses;
greater variety in available services, including where and
when appointments are offered and languages used by pro-
fessionals; enhancing workplace tolerance for mental health
leave; and improvements with insurance coverage and use
(Ojeda & McGuire, 2006). Based on previously sited
research, expanding mental health locations within the eth-
nic communities for easier accessibility and perhaps the use
of religious places of worship as potential liaisons to link
mental health services with ethnic families might be poten-
tial avenues to explore. Educating extended family members
about mental illness etiology and treatment, especially those
who might adhere to negative stigmas toward mental illness,
will be an effective way to foster supportive family environ-
ments. Furthermore, larger scale social policy concerns that
exist for many ethnic families, such as income, housing, and
education inequalities, have an impact on mental health and
should be addressed as well (Alegria et al., 2003). Future
research and policy efforts that aim to better understand how
ethnic families approach factors related to elements in the
ABC-X Model will be valuable in identifying the most effec-
tive way to address their mental health issues and result in
positive outcomes for families and individuals.
