Abstract: Fearful faces are important social cues that alert others of potential threat. Even
backward masked fearful faces facilitate spatial attention. However, visual stimuli other
than fearful faces can signal potential threat. Indeed, unmasked snakes and spiders
modulate spatial attention. Yet, it is unclear if the rapid threat-related facilitation of spatial
attention to backward masked stimuli is elicited by non-face threat cues. Evolutionary
theories claim that phylogenetic threats (i.e. snakes and spiders) should preferentially elicit
an automatic fear response, but it is untested as to whether this response extends to
enhancements in spatial attention under restricted processing conditions. Thirty individuals
completed a backward masking dot-probe task with both evolutionary relevant and
irrelevant threat cues. The results suggest that backward masked visual fear stimuli
modulate spatial attention. Both evolutionary relevant (snake) and irrelevant (gun) threat
cues facilitated spatial attention.
Keywords: emotion, fear, evolution, backward masking, dot-probe.

Introduction
Threatening stimuli are theorized to elicit an evolutionary-based fear response that
increases an individual's likelihood of survival (LeDoux, 1996; Öhman and Mineka, 2001).
This response may be initiated through a subcortical neural system for rapid, relatively non-
discriminative, responses or a cortical based system for slow discriminative responses
(LeDoux, 1996). One aspect of this fear response is the automatic direction of visuospatial
attention to the location of potential threat. Threatening facial expressions are important
biological indicators of danger that enhance spatial attention both in unrestricted (Pourtois,
Grandjean, Sander, and Vuilleumier, 2004; Pourtois, Schwartz, Seghier, Lazeyras, and
Vuilleumier, 2006) and restricted (Carlson and Reinke, 2008; Fox, 2002; Mogg and
Masked threat modulates spatial attention
Bradley, 1999) processing conditions. However, facial stimuli are not the only significant
signals of threat in the environment. For example, poisonous and predatory animals such
as snakes, spiders, and sharks can inflict bodily harm and are commonly feared or avoided.
Restricted processing of threat images of this nature have been shown to enhance skin
conductance (SCR; Öhman and Soares, 1993, 1994) and amygdala (Carlsson et al., 2004)
responses. In unrestricted processing conditions these types of threat stimuli modulate
spatial attention (Blanchette, 2006; Öhman, Flykt, and Esteves, 2001). Yet, it is unclear if
visual threat related stimuli, other than facial expressions, elicit enhancements in spatial
attention under restricted processing conditions, such as backward masking.
Backward masking is a method in which the processing of visual threat stimuli can
be restricted. Previous research has demonstrated that fearful faces that are presented for 33
ms (or less) and immediately followed by a mask (neutral face) result in increased activity
in the amygdala, superior colliculus, and thalamic pulvinar (Liddell et al., 2005; Morris et
al., 1996; Morris, Öhman, and Dolan, 1999; Whalen et al., 1998; Williams et al., 2006).
Activity in this same pathway has been observed in cortically blind patients (who do not
experience "conscious vision") while viewing unmasked fearful faces (Morris, DeGelder,
Weiskrantz, and Dolan, 2001) suggesting this subcortical pathway supports crude visual
fear processing. Additionally, research has shown that backward masked snakes and
spiders enhance skin conductance responses (Öhman and Soares, 1993, 1994) and elicit
amygdala (Carlsson et al., 2004) responses relative to neutral stimuli in snake or spider
phobic individuals, respectively. Based on participants' objective and subjective behavioral
measures, some studies have reported that stimuli presented in this manner are not
consciously processed (Glascher and Adolphs, 2003; Whalen et al., 1998). However, other
findings indicate that the degree of awareness varies across individuals (Pessoa, Japee, and
Ungerleider, 2005) and an individual's level of awareness modulates the amygdala
response to fearful faces (Pessoa, Japee, Sturman, and Ungerleider, 2006). Therefore,
while the degree to which backward masked stimuli are processed subliminally is still
debated, backward masking does restrict the amount of relative visual information
compared to unmasked visual stimuli.
Several psychological theories argue for an evolutionarily prepared fear module,
which is involved in automatically orienting attention to threat stimuli (LeDoux, 1996;
Öhman, Flykt, and Esteves, 2001; Öhman and Mineka, 2001). Evidence for this model
comes from conditioning experiments that suggest phylogenetic or evolutionary relevant
fear stimuli are more sensitive to fear conditioning and are more robust to extinction effects
(Öhman and Mineka, 2001). Several studies that have directly compared the spatial
attention grabbing effects of unmasked phylogenetically and ontogenetically fear-relevant
stimuli indicate that fear-relevant stimuli in general facilitate spatial attention (Blanchette,
2006; Brosch and Sharma, 2005; Fox, Griggs, and Mouchlianitis, 2007). Additionally,
backward masked fear-conditioned snakes and spiders have been shown to grab spatial
attention (Beaver, Mogg, and Bradley, 2005). However, these phylogenetically relevant
threats were not compared to ontogenetically fear-relevant stimuli and it is unclear what
effect evolutionary relevant fear stimuli not presented in a conditioning paradigm would
have on spatial attention. While Öhman's (2001) evolutionary based theory allows for fear
learning and behavioral studies have shown conditioning-related spatial attention effects to
previously neutral stimuli (Koster, Crombez, Van Damme, Verschuere, and De Houwer,
2005) and evolutionary relevant fear stimuli (Armony and Dolan, 2002; Beaver et al.,,

Masked threat modulates spatial attention
2005) it might be expected that under limited and restricted processing conditions that the
evolutionary relevancy of a stimulus is more salient. That is, if backward masked fear
stimuli are processed through an evolutionarily older subcortical route, one might expect a
preference for phylogenetically, compared to ontogenetically, relevant threats under
restricted processing conditions. Indeed, this "older" subcortical amygdala, pulvinar, and
superior collicular network is hypothesized to specifically have evolved for the rapid
processing of and response to venomous snakes (Isbell, 2006). Therefore, it may be
expected that crude representations of phylogenetically and ontogenetically fear-relevant
stimuli would differentially influence behavior under the restricted processing conditions of
backward masking.
While fearful faces have been shown to enhance spatial attention under restricted
processing conditions (Carlson and Reinke, 2008; Fox, 2002), it is unclear if this threat
related facilitation of spatial attention extends to other types of visually threatening stimuli,
such as snakes, spiders, guns, and knives. Furthermore, it is unclear as to whether fear
modulated spatial attention in restricted processing conditions is sensitive to the
evolutionary relevancy of threatening stimuli. The purpose of the current experiment was to
address these issues by using evolutionary relevant and irrelevant threat images in the dot-
probe paradigm (see Figure 1). Each trial of the task consisted of two images (one
threatening and one neutral) simultaneously presented (33 ms) to the left and right of
fixation and immediately masked by neutral images (100 ms). Participants then responded
to a target dot appearing either on the left or right side of the screen, which could either be
spatially congruent or incongruent with the threat image. It was predicted that threatening
compared to neutral images would modulate spatial attention. Specifically, reaction times
were predicted to be faster on congruent (target and threat image located at the same spatial
location) compared to incongruent (target and threat image located on opposite sides of the
screen) trials. Additionally, given the theorized evolutionarily adaptive basis of this
attentional response (LeDoux, 1996; Öhman and Mineka, 2001), it was predicted that
evolutionary relevant fear stimuli would enhance spatial attention to a greater degree than
evolutionary irrelevant fear stimuli. That is, the facilitation of reaction times for congruent
compared to incongruent trials should be larger when the threat image is evolutionary
relevant rather than evolutionary irrelevant.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Thirty-two introductory psychology students from Southern Illinois University at
Carbondale with normal or corrected to normal vision completed a dot-probe task for
partial course credit. Participants were provided with informed consent and treated
according to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board. Two participants were
excluded from data analysis for having poor overall task performance ( 86% correct).
Overall accuracy scores for these participants were lower than two standard deviations (SD
= 4%) from the group mean accuracy score (96% correct), which suggests that these
participants were less compliant with task instructions. As noted in the results section the
exclusion of these 2 participants did not influence the results. The final sample included 30
participants (16 female, 14 male). Of these participants, three reported being left handed,
while the remaining 27 participants reported that they were right handed.

Masked threat modulates spatial attention
Stimuli and Material
Six evolutionary relevant threatening (1051, 1200, 1270, 1274, 1930, and 2100), six
evolutionary irrelevant threatening (6260, 6350, 6560, 9592, 9630, and 9911), and six
neutral from both evolutionary relevant (e.g., mushrooms and trees) and irrelevant (e.g.,
spoon and hairdryer) categories (2010, 5531, 5593, 5780, 7004, and 7050) color images
from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang, 1999) were used in the
current study. Comparisons between the normative valence and arousal ratings of the
IAPS images validate our threatening (M valence = 3.18, M arousal = 5.89) vs. neutral (M
valence = 5.89, M arousal = 3.25) image categorization (ps < .05). Evolutionary relevant
and irrelevant fear stimuli did not differ (ps > .10) in their overall arousal ratings (M
relevant = 5.52, M irrelevant = 6.27) or overall luminosity (M relevant = 73.16, M
irrelevant = 76.44). Examples of presumably evolutionary relevant fear stimuli consist of
snakes, spiders, and bugs, whereas knives, syringes, and guns are examples of evolutionary
irrelevant fear stimuli. Sixteen additional neutral stimuli were chosen as masks from both
evolutionary relevant (e.g., birds, bunny, trees, and shells) and irrelevant (e.g., basket, fan,
chair, and bus) subcategories (1450, 1603, 1731, 1740, 1750, 5030, 5532, 5535, 5720,
5760, 5800, 7002, 7010, 7020, 7037, 7060, 7140, 7235, 7496, and 7620). The experiment
was programmed with E-Prime and displayed on a 60 Hz 16" Dell computer monitor.
Responses were made with an Electrical Geodesics Inc (EGI) response pad.

Procedure
As depicted in Figure 1, each trial began with a white fixation cue (+) in the center
of a black screen for 1000 ms. Next, two images (subtending 6 x 8 and separated by 11.5
of visual angle) were simultaneously presented (33 ms) to the left and the right of fixation.
These initial images always contained one threat and one neutral image with the threat
image equally occurring in the left and right visual fields. The initial images were
immediately masked by a separate sample of neutral IAPS images for 100 ms (the same
neutral image mask was presented on each side of the screen to prevent potential

asymmetrical mask biases). We do not claim that these backward masking procedures
rendered the initial image subliminal or nonconscious per se, but did restrict the processing
of the initial image (relative to unmasked images). Finally, the target dot appeared either on
the left or the right side of the screen and participants indicated as quickly as possible the
location of the target dot, which remained on the screen until the participant responded.
Participants used their right index finger to indicate when the target appeared on the left
side of the screen and right middle finger to indicate the target appeared on the right side of
the screen. Half of the initial threat images were spatially congruent with the target dot,
while the other half were spatially incongruent (in this instance the neutral image precedes
the target). If the initial threat image automatically captures spatial attention (relative to the
competing initial neutral image) then threat congruent trials should produce faster reaction
times than incongruent trials. During each trial, the fixation cue remained in the center of
the screen throughout the entirety of the trial and participants were instructed to always
fixate on this cue. The experiment began with a brief (15 trial) practice block followed by
five experimental blocks of 64 trials.
Results
Similar to other dot-probe studies (Carlson and Reinke, 2008; Fox, 2002), only
correct responses between 100 and 750 ms were included in the analysis of reaction time
data, which therefore excluded incorrect (4%), premature (0.3%), and delayed responses
(0.7%), respectively. Reaction time analyses were performed on the remaining 95% of the
data. An Evolutionary Relevancy (relevant vs. irrelevant) by Congruency (congruent vs.
incongruent) by Visual Field (left vs. right) repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was conducted on participants' reaction time data. There was a significant effect
of congruency (F (1, 29) = 5.21, p < .05, p
2 = .15) where there were faster reaction times
for congruent (341.17 ms) relative to incongruent (345.48 ms) trials. The congruency effect
remained significant when the reaction time data for facial cues (angry and neutral) were
excluded from the analysis, F (1, 31) = 6.87, p < .05, p
2 = .19, congruent: 340.3 ms,
incongruent: 345.6 ms. This suggests that threat stimuli other than faces capture spatial
attention in restricted processing conditions. When poor performers were included in the
analysis the overall congruency effect still remained significant, F (1, 31) = 4.51, p < .05,
p
2 = .13. The Evolutionary Relevancy by Congruency interaction failed to reach
significance (F (1, 29) = 1.24, p = .27, p
2 = .04). However, given our a priori hypothesis
of a stronger congruency effect for evolutionary relevant threats, we performed follow up t-
tests to further explore this effect. Evolutionary relevant threats resulted in significantly
faster reaction times on congruent compared to incongruent trials (p < .05). While a similar
pattern was found for evolutionary irrelevant threats, this difference did not reach
significance (p > .05, see Table 1 for mean reaction times). The Congruency by Visual
Field interaction did not reach significance, F (1, 29) = 1.85, p = .18, p
2 = .06, nor did the
Evolutionary Relevancy by Visual Field and the Evolutionary Relevancy by Visual Field
by Congruency interactions (F's (1, 29) < 1). These results suggest that backward masked
threatening images modulate spatial attention.

corrected t-tests, which explicitly tested for faster reaction times in congruent compared to
incongruent trials (i.e., single-tailed), revealed that certain threat images such as an open
mouthed snake (t (29) = 2.86, pcorr < .05) and a pointed gun (t (29) = 3.18, pcorr < .05) were
more effective in capturing spatial attention than other threats. While there was a
difference between individual stimuli on the size of the congruency effect, these differences
did not align with evolutionary relevance.

Discussion
The present findings indicate that visual fear-relevant stimuli such as snakes and
guns have the capacity to modulate spatial attention under the restricted processing
conditions of backward masking. These results extend previous findings of enhanced
spatial attention to masked threatening faces in highly trait anxious (Fox, 2002; Mogg and
Bradley, 1999, 2002) and unselected populations (Carlson and Reinke 2008), suggesting
this behavior is not solely associated with facial cues of threat, but includes other types of
visual threat as well. These attention effects were not influenced by evolutionary relevancy
in the current study. That is, both evolutionary relevant (i.e., snake) and irrelevant (i.e.,
gun) backward masked visual threat stimuli enhanced spatial attention.
Although evolutionary relevancy did not influence spatial attention, certain images
such as the striking snake and the aimed gun were more attention grabbing than others (see
Table 2). Interestingly, both of these threats were directed towards (as opposed to away
from) the observer. Previous research has revealed larger SCRs for backward masked
images of snakes and guns directed towards participants (Flykt, Esteves, and Öhman,
2007). Thus, observer directed threats may be more efficient in automatically eliciting
spatial attention under restricted processing conditions. This is possibly due to the
relatively more immediate nature of directed threats, where a rapid automatic fear response
would greatly enhance an organism's likelihood of surviving such a threat. Given that the

Masked threat modulates spatial attention
present study was not explicitly designed to address this issue, future research should
explore the role of crude directed vs. undirected threat on spatial attention.
We provide evidence that in addition to facial expressions other backward masked
threat-related visual stimuli are capable of eliciting enhancements in visuospatial attention.
Our data provide a behavioral complement to physiological research revealing enhanced
SCRs (Öhman and Soares, 1993, 1994) and amygdala activity (Carlsson et al., 2004) to
these types of visual threat. Backward masked fearful faces appear to be processed through
a subcortical superior collicular, thalamic pulvinar, amygdala system (Liddell et al., 2005;
Morris et al., 1996; Morris et al., 1999; Whalen et al., 1998; Williams et al., 2006) and to
enhance spatial attention through a neural network consisting of the amygdala, anterior
cingulate, and visual cortex (Carlson, Reinke, and Habib, 2009). It is unclear whether these
same systems mediate the processing and facilitation of spatial attention to other types of
backward masked threat stimuli. Backward masked snakes and spiders have been found to
elicit amygdala responses (Carlsson et al., 2004) and evolutionary theories claim that the
amygdala-pulvinar system specifically evolved in response to our ancestors' interactions
with venomous snakes (Isbell, 2006). It is believed that this system allows for rapid
detection and response to visual threats. However, future research is needed to determine
the complete neural system involved in mediating the spatial attention response to
backward masked non-face threat stimuli.
Emotion processing theories claim rapid fear responses, based on little to no
conscious knowledge of the eliciting stimulus, are evolutionarily advantageous, and
enhance an organism's likelihood of survival (LeDoux, 1996; Öhman and Mineka, 2001).
However, in the current experiment both evolutionary relevant and irrelevant threats
enhanced spatial attention, which suggests that while organisms may have an innate or
biological predisposition to direct attention towards crude representations of threatening
stimuli, the types of stimuli that elicit this response can be evolutionarily or culturally
relevant. A rapid attentional response to culturally learned fear stimuli is consistent with the
human amygdala's known role in fear conditioning or learning (Knight, Nguyen, and
Bandettini, 2005). According to LeDoux (1996), it is important to have some
evolutionarily determined triggers of the fear response. However, it is also important, in our
ever-changing world, to be able to learn or acquire culturally relevant fear triggers. While
culturally relevant fear associations appear to be acquired through the amygdala (Knight et
al., 2005), it is unclear whether crude representations of these types of fear stimuli would
interact with the spatial attention network. Our research suggests that learned triggers may
involve the same spatial attention network given that backward masking, which results in
limited visual processing, did not differentially affect behavior for evolutionary or cultural
fear stimuli.
However, while in the current experiment there was not an evolutionary relevancy
by congruency interaction, it is inappropriate to make strong conclusions from null results.
More research is needed in this area to better characterize the role of evolutionary
relevancy in automatic threat-elicited spatial attention. Additionally, the size of the threat-
elicited attention effect in the current experiment was rather small. The 100 ms gap (mask
duration) between the initial threat image and the target could partially account for this
relatively small overall congruency effect. That is, after 100ms the initial orienting of
attention to the threat image may begin to be released or weakened. However, masked
fearful face dot-probe studies with similar threat-to-target onset differences have revealed

Masked threat modulates spatial attention
larger attention effects (e.g., Carlson and Reinke, 2008). Future research could use a
methodology where the target is included in the mask that immediately follows the cue and
thus provide an immediate sampling of threat-elicited spatial attention.
In sum, we found that backward masked threatening visual stimuli such as snakes
and guns modulate spatial attention. It appears that the evolutionary relevancy of these
threat stimuli did not influence their attention grabbing efficacy. Other potential factors,
such as the direction of threat, may play an important role in whether or not degraded non-
face threat images elicit enhancements in spatial attention.
