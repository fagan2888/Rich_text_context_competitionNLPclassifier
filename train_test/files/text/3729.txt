Abstract
Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a challenging global and public health issue,
raising bioethical challenges, considerations and strategies.
Objectives: This research protocol presents a conceptual model leading to formulating an
empirically based bioethics framework for antibiotic use, AMR and designing ethically robust
strategies to protect human health.
Methods: Mixed methods research will be used and operationalized into five substudies. The
bioethical framework will encompass and integrate two theoretical models: global bioethics and
ethical decision-making.
Results: Being a study protocol, this article reports on planned and ongoing research.
Conclusions: Based on data collection, future findings and using a comprehensive, integrative,
evidence-based approach, a step-by-step bioethical framework will be developed for (i) responsible
use of antibiotics in healthcare and (ii) design of strategies to decrease AMR. This will entail the
analysis and interpretation of approaches from several bioethical theories, including deontological
and consequentialist approaches, and the implications of uncertainty to these approaches.

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a chal-
lenging global and public health issue that
gives rise to bioethical challenges, consider-
ations and strategies. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), AMR
threatens the very core of modern medicine
and the sustainability of an effective, global
public health response to the enduring threat
from infectious diseases.1 Deciding whether
to use antibiotics in a responsible way and
the proliferation of multi-resistant micro-
organisms defy current global public health
approaches. Such a decision entails in-depth
bioethical analysis that can and should be
applied at both clinical and global public
health levels.
Our research protocol, entitled ``Toward
a bioethical framework for antibiotic use,
antimicrobial resistance and for empirically
designing ethically robust strategies to
protect human health: a research protocol'',
aims to develop a bioethical framework for
antibiotic use and for designing ethically
robust strategies to protect and promote
human health against AMR in community
and hospital settings. This research is part of
a larger project of the Instituto de Bioe
´ tica,
Universidade Cato
´ lica Portuguesa, entitled
``Developing a Public Health Bioethical
Framework for Antibiotic Use and for
Designing Ethically Robust Strategies to
Protect and Promote Health from AMR''.
The project objective is to address this
bioethical and societal issue and investigate
how decision-making processes for the use
of antibiotics occur in community and hos-
pital settings.
The project is currently in its initial stages
and this article aims to present the state of
the art, background and research protocol
of this study. Because this is a study proto-
col, we only report on planned and ongoing
research studies. It is our conviction that,
in the future, the results will be useful
for tailoring ethically framed strategies to
decrease the problem of AMR and help
to protect and promote health. This is of
foremost relevance as the WHO has recog-
nized that without harmonized and imme-
diate action at global scale, the world is
heading towards a post-antibiotic era in
which common infections could once again
be deadly.1
Antimicrobial resistance from a
bioethical perspective: the state
of the art
AMR is a challenging global and public
health issue that gives rise to several con-
cerns, challenges, considerations and strate-
gies. Much emphasis has been placed on the
implications for human health of increasing
antibiotic resistance in pathogens, which is
owing to imprudent antibiotic prescription
and consumption as well as to widespread
and common use of antibiotics in agricul-
ture.2­4 However, more attention is needed
on the decision-making processes underly-
ing these practices.
Humanity is facing the very real possibil-
ity of a post-antibiotic era.5­8 Urgent action
is therefore needed to maintain the effect of
antibiotics9 and ensure equity of access to
this type of medication. From a global and
public health perspective, while developed
societies are struggling with problems
related to AMR, less-developed societies
still face the paucity and lack of access to
antibiotics.

AMR poses particularly important chal-
lenges for human health. The development
of a bioethical framework for antibiother-
apy calls for careful analysis of the ethics
``behind the scenes''. Responsibility is of
utmost complexity in this context as it lies
with individuals, healthcare professionals,
managers, policy makers and health sys-
tems; all stakeholders are simultaneously
vulnerable to and responsible for AMR.
Several global and public ethical issues
have been raised about the use of antibiotics
and AMR with respect to human health. For
instance, according to Leibovici et al.10, a
central question can be posed, namely,
whether we could and should consider bene-
fits in the distant future for unidentified
patients as being more important than bene-
fits in the near future for an identified
patient. This must be discussed within a
broader ethical debate by considering
diverse ethical theories, principles and
values. Using Kass's11 definition, bioethics
can help healthcare professionals and public
policy makers to recognize the ethical dilem-
mas surrounding antibiotic use as well as
strategies to reduce the extent of AMR.
Currently, owing to diverse reasons (e.g.,
AMR, economic hardship, population
ageing), physicians must sometimes choose
between the welfare of an individual patient
and a healthcare system directive to restrict
antibiotics.12 Preventing harm, preserving
the public good and protecting individual
liberty can conflict with each other because
infectious diseases not only threaten indi-
vidual health but also the welfare of other
human beings.7 The lack of consensus on an
ethical framework makes these decisions
more difficult, transforming physicians'
decision whether to prescribe antibiotics
and/or design strategies for fighting AMR
into a complex phenomenon.
The various components, values, prin-
ciples and theories behind clinical and
ethical decisions become manifest in dif-
ferent ways with respect to AMR. This
depends on the degree of uncertainty sur-
rounding the consequences of antibiotics'
use for human health and has implications
for the moral intensity of the ethical deci-
sions to be undertaken. Interventions aimed
at promoting the proper and prudent use of
antibiotics, using an empirically based
and bioethically sound framework, should
encompass `upstream' policy-relevant
actions, both within and outside the health-
care system. By doing so, physicians will be
able to act more objectively when deciding
whether to prescribe antibiotics.
Why a bioethical framework
for AMR?
AMR is a challenging global and public
health issue, raising several concerns, chal-
lenges, considerations and strategies.1,8,13­15
Compelling questions from the domains of
global, population and public health ethics
and the bioethics of infectious disease will
therefore be posed. Responsibility, in this
context, is of utmost complexity; all parties
are simultaneously vulnerable to and
responsible for AMR.16,17
The use of antibiotics leads to the
increase of AMR. This has implications for
consumer safety18 and health, and consti-
tutes a global and public health issue, chal-
lenge and concern. In 2015, the World
Health Assembly passed a new global
action plan on AMR, and the topic was
discussed as a priority for policy actions
among the G7 countries.19
AMR is spreading rapidly in developed
societies worldwide, making it one of the
most serious threats to human, public and
global health. The WHO6 has stated that a
post-antibiotic era is a very real possibility.
Hence, urgent actions are needed to maintain
the effect of antibiotics.9 In contrast, under-
developed countries still do not have equity
of access to antibiotics, which maintains the
high risk of death owing to common infec-
tious diseases in these countries.

Antibiotic consumption is a major driver
of AMR and there is large cross-country
variation in AMR.2 This is mainly owing to
different patterns of antibiotic prescription
and consumption. Indeed, prescribing style
is an important source of variation, not only
across but also within countries.20,21
Prescribing style involves the subjective ten-
dency of physicians to be more or less
inclined to prescribe antibiotics.22,23
Variations in the prescription style some-
times suggest poor clinical practices and can
contribute to the inadequate use of health-
care resources. Resource allocation is a key
ethical issue in health organizations and
systems. Interventions aimed at promoting
the rational use (clinically and ethically
sound) of antibiotics should encompass
actions at the policy-making level. This
highlights a need for common clinically
and ethically sound frameworks, not only
at individual but also at public, global and
policy levels.
Bioethics owes its development to aware-
ness of the seriousness and magnitude of
ethical issues or problems that no society
can ignore, no matter its level of techno-
logical development. Ethical principles, such
as individual responsibility (autonomy),
social responsibility (solidarity), vulnerabil-
ity, integrity, privacy, reciprocity and equity
of resource allocation must be pulled
together to simultaneously ensure individual
interests, societal welfare and the sustain-
ability of future generations.16,24
Population and individual-level
approaches have been used extensively to
explain variations in prescription styles and
consumption. However, little is known
about any bioethical framework behind or
within the decision-making processes for
prescribing and using antibiotics and for
preventing AMR.
The present bioethical framework will
encompass and integrate two models: global
bioethics and ethical decision-making. In the
first model, the conceptual global bioethics
problem of AMR is built in three steps.
First, AMR is a global bioethics problem
because of its following characteristics:
(i) worldwide scale, (ii) interconnectedness,
(iii) persistence, (iv) general scope and
(v) need for global action.17 Second, AMR
is considered a bioethical problem because it
has specific relevance for health and human
life and poses normative challenges. Finally,
the problem of AMR has three characteris-
tics: ambiguity, situation and horizon.17 The
second model,24­26 which has been con-
cerned with ethical decision-making in
organizations,27­29 can be successfully
applied to healthcare settings. The following
relevant features will be addressed: (i)
awareness of the ethical and moral dimen-
sions posed by the use of antibiotics; (ii)
ethical and moral judgements associated
with the use of antibiotics in the provision
of human healthcare; (iii) the main ethical
risks associated with development of
strategies to fight antibiotic resistance of
bacteria; (iv) whether there is the intention
to prioritize ethical and moral consider-
ations when addressing the problems posed
by AMR; and (v) whether the actual behav-
iour displayed in the use of antibiotics is
ethically grounded and sound.
Moving from a bioethical
conceptual framework
towards an empirical one:
the research protocol
This research protocol presents a conceptual
model leading to the formulation of an
empirically based bioethics framework for
antibiotic use, AMR and for designing
ethically robust strategies to protect human
health.
Objectives
The main objective of the research project is
to develop a bioethical framework for
1790 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
antibiotic use and for designing ethically
robust strategies to protect and promote
human health against AMR in community
and hospital settings. To empirically study
this global and public health issue, we
defined the following specific objectives: (i)
To understand the ethical rationale and
decision-making processes behind anti-
biotics' use in community and hospital care
settings; (ii) to identify the main ethical
issues associated with AMR in these set-
tings; (iii) to evaluate ethically different,
scientifically sound strategies to fight AMR
and (iv) to comprehend micro-meso-macro
linkages of the decision-making processes
concerning AMR in human healthcare
provision.
The following research questions will
complement our bioethical analysis and
framework: Can post-modern societies
infringe upon individual rights to promote
the common good and public health when a
person is diagnosed with a multidrug-
resistant infectious disease? When they are
diagnosed, should individuals be allowed to
self-determine whether they are too infectious
to use public transport (e.g., airplanes,
subways, trains, buses)? What procedures
should be applied when individuals are
diagnosed with new diseases of unknown or
uncertain contagiousness? How should we
deal with patients and next-of-kin when they
decide not to take prescriptions correctly,
thereby allowing dangerous pathogens to
mutate and become resistant to antibiotics?
What implications exist and what burdens
are likely to result if health practitioners
and policy makers propose targeting public
health interventions only to certain groups?
To achieve the main objective of this
project, diverse research methods and tech-
niques will be used and operationalized.
Because this manuscript refers to the research
protocol of the abovementioned project,
which is currently in its initial stages, no
data and no findings will be presented here.
We foresee that, based on our findings and use
of a comprehensive, integrative and evidence-
based approach, we will develop a step-by-
step bioethical framework for antibiotic use
and the design of strategies to decrease AMR.
This will entail the analysis and interpretation
of various approaches from several bioethical
and ethical theories, including deontological
and consequentialist approaches, and the
implications of uncertainty in relation to
these approaches.
Methods
A mixed-methods approach will be imple-
mented to achieve the main objective of this
research project. Therefore, quantitative
and qualitative research methods, tech-
niques and instruments will be combined
to gather empirical data and information on
the perceptions, attitudes and practices of
primary and hospital care physicians con-
cerning the following aspects: (i) antibiotics
consumption; (ii) antibiotics prescription;
(iii) AMR; (iv) clinical pathways associated
with the diagnosis and treatment of multi-
resistant infections; (v) evidence-based
strategies to reduce the problem of resist-
ance; (vi) bioethical frameworks of anti-
biotics use; and (vii) bioethical frameworks
for designing strategies to decrease AMR.
This project will include the following
substudies: (I) Systematic literature review
on bioethics, ethical issues and antibiotics
consumption, prescription and resistance.
(II) Systematic literature review on strate-
gies to decrease the problem of AMR. (III)
Empirical studies embracing both quantita-
tive (survey of healthcare professionals'
attitudes) and qualitative (documentary
analysis of existing guidelines and protocols
in Portuguese hospitals) approaches, includ-
ing use of the Delphi technique to build an
expert consensus on empirically and bioethi-
cally framed practices for protecting and
promoting human health in the face of
AMR. (IV) Development of a bioethical
framework for antibiotic use in the
Herna
´ndez-Marrero et al. 1791
provision of human healthcare, by integrat-
ing substudies (I) and (III). (V)
Development of a bioethical framework
for the design of strategies to face the
problem of AMR.
Currently, abstract screening for substu-
dies I and II (i.e., the two systematic reviews)
is underway and the first results are expected
to be publicly available by mid 2017. A
summary of the reviewed materials will be
presented in tabular form complemented by
a narrative description. The results will be
classified into the main conceptual cate-
gories, which will be obtained during extrac-
tion of the results. We anticipate that the
results of these studies will enable the devel-
opment of instruments for data collection to
be used for substudy III (empirical study
using a mixed-methods approach).
All substudies will follow the correspond-
ing EQUATOR Network reporting guide-
lines. It is our conviction that these studies
will yield relevant data and information,
which will be useful to tailor the develop-
ment of a bioethical framework of antibiotic
use in human healthcare provision (sub-
study IV) and ethically framed strategies to
decrease the problem of AMR and to pro-
tect and promote health (substudy V).
Concluding remarks
AMR is a challenging global and public
health issue that gives rise to numerous
bioethical challenges, considerations and
strategies. Deciding whether to use antibio-
tics in a responsible way and the prolifer-
ation of multidrug-resistant microorganisms
defy current public health approaches.
This article reflects the research protocol
of a project aimed at developing a bioethical
framework for antibiotic use and for design-
ing ethically robust strategies to protect and
promote human health against AMR in
community and hospital settings. Based on
our ongoing data collection and future
findings and using a comprehensive,
integrative and evidence-based approach, a
step-by-step bioethical framework will be
developed for (i) responsible use of anti-
biotics in healthcare contexts and (ii) design
of strategies to decrease AMR. This will
entail the analysis and interpretation of
various approaches from several bioethical
and ethical theories, including deontological
and consequentialist approaches, and the
implications of uncertainty with respect to
these approaches.
