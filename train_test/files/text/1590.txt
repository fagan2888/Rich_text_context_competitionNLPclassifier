Education Level and Mortality in Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus (SLE): Evidence of
Underascertainment of Deaths Due to SLE in
Ethnic Minorities With Low Education Levels
MICHAEL M. WARD
Objective. To determine if socioeconomic status, as measured by education level, is associated with mortality due to
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to determine if these associations differ among ethnic groups.
Methods. Sex- and race-specific mortality rates due to SLE by education level were computed for persons age 25­64 years
using US Multiple Causes of Death data from 1994 to 1997. SLE-specific mortality rates were compared with all-cause
mortality rates in 1997 to determine if the association between education level and mortality in SLE was similar to that
in other causes of death.
Results. Among whites, the risk of death due to SLE was significantly higher among those with lower levels of education,
and the risk gradient closely paralleled the 1997 all-cause mortality risks by education level. However, in African
American women and men and Asian/Pacific Islander women, the risk of death due to SLE was lower among those with
lower education levels, contrary to the associations between education level and all-cause mortality in these groups.
Comparing the distribution of education levels among deaths due to SLE and all deaths in 1997, persons with lower
education levels were underrepresented among deaths due to SLE in African Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders.
Conclusion. Among whites, higher education levels are associated with lower mortality due to SLE. These associations
were not present in ethnic minorities, likely due to underascertainment of deaths due to SLE in less-well educated
persons. This underascertainment may be due to underreporting of SLE on death certificates, but may also represent
underdiagnosis of SLE in ethnic minorities with low education levels.

INTRODUCTION
In epidemiologic studies, higher socioeconomic status has
been consistently associated with lower all-cause mortal-
ity and with lower mortality due to cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disease (1­15). Similar associations have
been found for both whites and African Americans when
race-specific mortality has been examined (2­4,6­10,
12,14,15). In studies that used education level as the mea-
sure of socioeconomic status, mortality rates among those
with 12 years of education were often 1.5­2.0 times
higher than those of college graduates (1,4,5,8,13). Similar
associations have been reported for patients with rheuma-
toid arthritis (16­20).
Few studies have examined the association of socioeco-
nomic status with mortality in systemic lupus erythema-
tosus (SLE) (21­25). Most studies examined clinic-based
cohorts, which may be susceptible to selection bias and
have limited generalizability. Four of the 5 studies used
medical insurance status as the measure of socioeconomic
status, or inferred patients' socioeconomic status from the
economic characteristics of their area of residence, rather
than using more direct personal measures of socioeco-
nomic status, such as income or education level (21­24).
An ecologic analysis of national data from the United
States found higher mortality rates due to SLE in counties
with higher poverty rates (26). Previous studies also re-
ported higher mortality rates due to SLE among African
Americans and Asian Americans, but these studies did not

examine mortality by socioeconomic status (27­29).
Knowing if socioeconomic status is associated with mor-
tality in patients with SLE would indicate whether reports
of higher mortality among ethnic minorities were con-
founded by differences in socioeconomic status. This
question is important because although the health out-
comes of patients with SLE have improved over time,
10­20% of patients with SLE die within 10 years of its
onset (30).
In this study, I examined the hypothesis that socioeco-
nomic status, measured by education level, was inversely
associated with mortality due to SLE in whites, African
Americans, and Asian/Pacific Islanders in the United
States, using national data on deaths from 1994 to 1997.
Trends in SLE mortality by education level were also
compared with similar trends in all-cause mortality.
METHODS
Data on the number of deaths occurring in the United
States in persons with SLE were abstracted from Multiple
Causes of Death files of the National Center for Health
Statistics (31). These files include information on all re-
corded deaths occurring in the United States each year,
based on death certificates filed in each state. Records for
each death include the underlying cause of death and up
to 20 additional conditions listed as associated or contrib-
uting causes of death, by International Classification of
Diseases Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes (32). Each record
also includes the decedents' age, sex, race (white, black,
Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander), Hispanic ethnic-
ity, and place of residence, as well as information on the
time and place of death.
Information on the decedents' education level was first
included on the Standard Certificate of Death in 1989, but
this item was not immediately adopted by all states. In
1993, information on education level was not available for
deaths in New York City, Georgia, Oklahoma, Rhode Is-
land, and South Dakota, was missing for 20% of deaths
in Kentucky and West Virginia (and therefore considered
unreliable), and was missing for 9% of deaths in other
states. Beginning in 1994, information on education level
was available for deaths in 46 states, New York City, and
the District of Columbia. Georgia, Oklahoma, Rhode Is-
land, and South Dakota did not include education level on
their death certificates. Data on education level were miss-
ing for 20% of deaths in Kentucky. In the remaining
states, data on education level were missing for 4.2% of
deaths since 1994.
For this study, all deaths occurring in 45 states and the
District of Columbia (excluding Georgia, Oklahoma, Rhode
Island, South Dakota, and Kentucky) from 1994 to 1997 in
which SLE was included as either the underlying cause,
immediate cause, or contributing cause of death were in-
cluded. The study was limited to persons age 25­64 years
because SLE most often occurs in young adulthood or
middle age, because most people have completed their
formal education by age 25, and because death certificate
data on education level may be less accurate among per-
sons age 65 and older (33). For each death, data were
abstracted on age, sex, race, years of education, and place
of death.
Nephritis and renal failure are markers of severe SLE
and major risk factors for death (23,34­37), and likely
identify a subset of persons in whom the diagnosis of SLE
is made with greater specificity. Therefore, decedents
whose records included acute or chronic glomerulone-
phritis (ICD-9 codes 580­583), acute renal failure (ICD-9
code 584), chronic renal failure (ICD-9 code 585), or renal
failure, unspecified (ICD-9 code 586) as one of the multiple
causes of death along with SLE were also identified.
Mortality rates by education level for each sex and race
subgroup were computed using census counts as the de-
nominators. Counts by age (in 5-year age groups), sex, race,
education level, and state from the 1990 census were pro-
jected to 1994­1997, and the projections were added to
provide the population at risk of death in these years (38).
Counts for Georgia, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Da-
kota, and Kentucky were omitted from these totals. Al-
though information on deaths by both race and Hispanic
ethnicity was available, mortality by Hispanic ethnicity
could not be analyzed because census data on education
level by both race and Hispanic ethnicity were not avail-
able for each state. Therefore, Hispanics were not analyzed
as a separate category, but were included in either the
white, African American, or Native American racial
groups. For white and African American women, mortality
rates were computed for education levels of 0­8 years,
9­11 years, 12 years, 13­15 years, and 16 or more years.
Because fewer deaths due to SLE occurred in men and
Asian/Pacific Islander women, mortality rates for these
groups were computed for education levels of 0­11 years,
12 years, and 13 years. Because validation studies of
death certificate information have indicated that ethnic
minorities with 12 years of education were more likely to
be recorded as being high school graduates than recorded
with lower levels of educational attainment, comparisons
were also performed using only 2 categories of education
(12 versus 13 years) (33).
Sex- and race-specific mortality rates were age adjusted
using direct standardization, with the 1990 United States
population as the standard. For strata with 100 deaths,
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the mortality rates
were computed based on Poisson distribution. For strata
with 100 deaths, 95% CIs for the mortality rates were
computed based on z distribution (39). Poisson regression
models were used to estimate rate ratios for mortality due
to SLE among education groups, with the highest educa-
tion category as the reference group. P values  0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Analyses were per-
formed separately for each sex and race, and for persons
with SLE included as any category of cause of death (un-
derlying, immediate, or contributing), for those with SLE
as the underlying cause of death, and for those with SLE
who had renal disease included among the causes of
death. Analyses were performed using SAS programs (ver-
sion 8; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
To determine if the association between education level
and mortality due to SLE was similar to that of other
causes of death, these analyses were repeated using all
deaths in 1997. Consistency in the education-related risks
Education Level and Mortality in SLE 617
of mortality between deaths due to SLE and all-cause
mortality would support the validity of this association,
whereas inconsistency would suggest either that the edu-
cation-mortality association was modified in the setting of
SLE, or that there were deficiencies in the identification of
deaths due to SLE.
RESULTS
From 1994 to 1997, there were 4,779 deaths among per-
sons age 25­64 years for which SLE was recorded as the
underlying, immediate, or contributing cause. Data on ed-
ucation level were missing for 160 persons (3.3%), and
these people were excluded from analysis. These persons
did not differ from the 4,619 persons who had information
on education level in age, sex, race, or the likelihood that
SLE was the underlying cause of death. Persons with miss-
ing data on education level were more likely to have died
in 1994 (4.2%) than in 1997 (2.2%). Of the 4,619 persons
studied, 3,939 (85.3%) were women, 2,649 (57.3%) were
white, 1,755 were African American (38.0%), 187 (4.0%)
were Asian/Pacific Islander, and 28 (0.6%) were Native
American. Three hundred forty-seven persons (7.5%)
completed 8 years of education, 583 (12.6%) completed
9­11 years, 2,003 (43.4%) completed 12 years, 981
(21.2%) completed 13­15 years, and 705 (15.3%) com-
pleted 16 years. The mean age of death was 46.1 years.
SLE was the underlying cause of death for 2,852 persons
(61.7%). Renal disease was listed as one of the multiple
causes of death for 1,049 persons (22.7%), with the most
common diagnoses being unspecified renal failure (n 
564) and chronic renal failure (n  293). Table 1 shows the
distribution of deaths due to SLE in 1994­1997 and all
deaths in 1997 by education level (12 years versus 12
years). There were too few deaths due to SLE among
Asian/Pacific Islander men (n  24) and Native Americans
for meaningful analysis, and these groups were not ana-
lyzed further.
Among white women, the age-adjusted mortality rate
due to SLE (as an underlying, immediate, or contributing
cause of death) decreased from 20.9/million in those with
0­8 years of education to 7.4/million in those with 16
years of education (Table 2). White women with 0­8 years
of education were twice as likely to have died of SLE than
those with 16 years of education, and the risks decreased
progressively with increasing education level. Results
were similar for analyses of SLE as the underlying cause of
death and for the subgroup with renal disease, with some-
what stronger risk gradients for these outcomes. Findings
in white men were similar to those in women, with mor-
tality rates due to SLE as any cause of death or as the
underlying cause significantly higher among those with
12 years of education (Table 3). For both white women
and white men, the education gradient in risk of mortality
due to SLE closely paralleled the education gradient in
risk in all-cause mortality (Figure 1).
Among African American women, the age-adjusted mor-
tality rates due to SLE were similar among those with 12
years, 13­15 years, and 16 years of education (Table 4).
However, the mortality rates due to SLE were lower among
those with 0­8 years or 9­11 years of education. African
American women with 0­8 years of education were only
48% as likely to die of SLE as those with a college educa-
tion, and those with 9­11 years of education were only
76% as likely to die of SLE as those with a college educa-
tion. Results were similar in analyses of SLE as the under-
lying cause of death and for the subgroup with renal dis-
ease as a cause of death. These decreased risks of mortality
due to SLE contrasted with the increased risk of all-cause
mortality among less-well educated African American
women (Figure 1).
Results for African American men and Asian/Pacific
Islander women demonstrated a pattern similar to that of
African American women. Among African American men,
the risk of SLE-related mortality was 30% lower among
those with 0­11 years of education than among those with
13 years of education (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.70),
whereas all-cause mortality was approximately twice as
high in those with 0­11 years of education (Table 5 and
Figure 1). Among Asian/Pacific Islander women, the risk
of SLE-related mortality among those with 0­11 years of
education was only 72% of the risk of those with 13
years of education, whereas the risk of all-cause mortality
was slightly increased among those with 0­11 years of
education (Table 6 and Figure 1).
To limit the effects of any upgrading of education levels
to high school graduate, the data were also analyzed by
comparing those with 12 years of education with those
reported as having 12 years of education (Table 7). White
women with 12 years of education were 1.64 times more
likely to die of SLE than white women with 12 years of
education. This risk was similar to the all-cause mortality

risk of 1.51 associated with lower education levels in
white women. Among white men, the risk of mortality due
to SLE in those with 12 years of education (OR 2.12) was
almost identical to the all-cause mortality risk (OR 2.10).
However, among African American women (OR 1.03), Af-
rican American men (OR 0.92), and Asian/Pacific Islander
women (OR 0.90), there was no association between lower
education levels and mortality due to SLE, even though in
each group those with lower education levels had signifi-
cantly higher risks of all-cause mortality (ORs of 1.38, 1.76,
and 1.22, respectively). Results were similar for the sub-
groups with mortality due to SLE as the underlying cause
and mortality due to SLE with renal disease.
A possible explanation for the divergent association be-
tween education level and mortality risk due to SLE and
its association with all-cause mortality in ethnic minori-
ties, and for the differences in this association between
ethnic minorities and whites, may be found in the distri-
bution of education levels in these groups. In white
women and white men, two-thirds of deaths due to SLE

Education Level and Mortality in SLE 619
and two-thirds of deaths due to any cause occurred in
persons with 12 years of education (Table 1). However,
among African American women, African American men,
and Asian/Pacific Islander women, there were relatively
fewer deaths due to SLE occurring in those with 12 years
of education than deaths due to any cause. For example,
among African American women, 73.3% of all deaths oc-
curred in persons with 12 years of education, but only
61.3% of deaths due to SLE occurred in this education
group, representing an absolute decrease of 12% and a
relative decrease of 20%. This suggests a selective absence
of deaths due to SLE recorded among ethnic minorities
with 12 years of education.
DISCUSSION
This national, population-based study indicates that edu-
cation level has an important association with mortality
due to SLE among whites. Compared with those with 16
years of education, the risk of mortality due to SLE was
twice as high among white women with 8 years of edu-
cation. Mortality risks decreased with increasing educa-
tion level so that risks were similar between those with
13­15 years and 16 years of education. Among white
women, the mortality risk gradient with education level
was higher among those with renal disease, as might be
expected if renal disease was a marker of more severe SLE,

and if socioeconomic status was associated with the sever-
ity of SLE. Among white men, risks of mortality due to SLE
were twice as high among those with 12 years of educa-
tion, compared with those with 12 years of education.
The association between education level and mortality
due to SLE in whites paralleled that found for all-cause
mortality, and is consistent with many previous studies
that demonstrate that persons of higher socioeconomic
status have lower mortality rates (1­15). These associa-
tions support the validity of the analytic approach used
here, which merged information on education level from
death certificates with census data to compute mortality
rates by education level.
In contrast to the findings in whites, and in contrast to
the associations between socioeconomic status and all-
cause mortality in many prior studies, higher education
levels were not associated with lower mortality due to SLE
among African Americans or Asian/Pacific Islander
women. In fact, lower education levels appeared protec-
tive of mortality due to SLE among African American

Education Level and Mortality in SLE 621
women, and similar trends were evident among African
American men and Asian/Pacific Islander women. This
effect appeared to be specific for mortality due to SLE,
because all-cause mortality in these groups was higher
among those with lower education levels. There are sev-
eral potential explanations for the difference. It is possible
that SLE is more prevalent in ethnic minorities with higher
education levels and more prevalent in whites with low
education levels, and these differences in prevalence
translated into the differences in mortality rates that were
observed. However, this explanation seems unlikely, as
there is no evidence that the prevalence of SLE varies by
socioeconomic status differently in different ethnic
groups. Postponement of mortality past age 65 may also
influence these results, but for this explanation to account
for the ethnic differences detected, one would need to
postulate that high education levels lead to preferential
postponement of mortality in whites with SLE, whereas
low education levels lead to preferential postponement of
mortality in ethnic minorities with SLE, which seems im-
probable. Similarly, the findings could be explained by
high mortality before age 25 in ethnic minorities with 12
years of education, but low mortality before age 25 in
whites with 12 years of education, in those with onset of
SLE in adolescence or young adulthood. However, the
generally low mortality in this age group makes this ex-
planation unlikely (24,40,41).
It also is possible that the severity of SLE differs among
ethnic groups. The interpretation that ethnic differences in
severity account for the results would need to explain why
low education levels would be associated with more se-
vere SLE and higher mortality rates in whites but with less
severe SLE and lower mortality rates in ethnic minorities.
Similar associations were also present in the subgroup of
patients with SLE and renal disease as a cause of death.
The associations in this subgroup, which controls in part
for the severity of SLE, suggest that differences in severity
are unlikely to account for the findings. A differential

association between education level and mortality by race
would also conflict with the results of a cohort study that
demonstrated similar socioeconomic effects on mortality
in whites and African Americans with SLE (24).
A more likely explanation for the findings in African
Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders is underascertain-
ment of deaths due to SLE in those with 12 years of
education. This group was underrepresented among
deaths due to SLE, with relative decreases of 20­25%
compared with the proportion of deaths from all causes
among persons of similar education levels in these ethnic
groups. Such underrepresentation was not present among
whites, for which the proportions with 12 years of edu-
cation were identical in deaths due to SLE and deaths due
to any cause. Because of this underascertainment, it may
not be possible to report valid mortality rates due to SLE in
African Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders from this
source.
Bias in the reporting of education level on death certif-
icates results in more people with low education levels
being classified as having completed high school (33).
Although more common among decedents 65 years or
older, this misclassification also occurs in younger age
groups and is more common among African Americans.
Although this upgrading may have impacted our examina-
tion of risk gradients by education level in ethnic minori-
ties, racial differences in the associations between educa-
tion level and SLE-related mortality on one hand, and
between education level and all-cause mortality on the
other hand, persisted when results were compared be-
tween those with some college and those with high school
educations or less.
This study indicates that mortality due to SLE is higher
among whites with lower socioeconomic status, as mea-
sured by educational attainment. It is difficult to draw
conclusions about the association between education level
and mortality due to SLE in other ethnic groups because of
evidence suggesting possible underascertainment of
deaths due to SLE in ethnic minorities with lower levels of
education. This underascertainment may be due to more
frequent misreporting of causes of death among ethnic
minorities with low socioeconomic status, and specifically
underreporting of SLE among these patients. However, of
more concern is that this underascertainment could reflect
the underdiagnosis of SLE in persons of low socioeco-
nomic status, particularly ethnic minorities. Underdiagno-
sis would likely be associated with inadequate treatment.
Population-based prospective cohort studies with active
case findings are needed to investigate these possibilities,
and to investigate the role of limited access to medical care
in the diagnosis and treatment of SLE in ethnic minorities
of lower socioeconomic status. These findings also suggest
that SLE may be underrepresented in United States mor-
tality statistics (29).
