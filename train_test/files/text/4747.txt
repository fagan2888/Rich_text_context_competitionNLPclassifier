Abstract
Introduction: This study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of using the Perio-Flow
device (Electro Medical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland) adjunctively with mechanical instrumentation
on periodontal parameters and halitosis.
Materials and Methods: Sixty patients who presented with a 4- to 6-mm probing pocket depth
were recruited for the study. Patients were randomly assigned to scaling and root planing (SRP) or
SRP þ glycine powder air-polishing (GPAP). For both groups, the plaque index, gingival index,
pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and clinical attachment level scores were recorded at baseline
and 1 month. Volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) were measured by a Halimeter (Interscan Corp.,
Chatsworth, CA, USA) at baseline, immediately after treatment, and at 7, 14, and 30 days.
Results: Both groups showed significantly lower plaque index, gingival index, pocket depth,
bleeding on probing, and clinical attachment level gain scores at 1 month than at baseline.
No significant differences were found between the groups at any time point. The VSCs were
significantly different at 1 month compared with baseline in both groups. However, the intergroup
comparisons of VSCs were not statistically significant at any time point.
Conclusion: Within the limits of this study, SRP is effective for treatment of periodontitis and
halitosis. However, using GPAP adjunctively with mechanical instrumentation has no beneficial
effects on halitosis or periodontal parameters.

Introduction
Slightly more than a century ago, scaling
and root planing (SRP) appeared to be
necessary for the maintenance of periodon-
tal health. SRP was the only treatment for
periodontal disease. Despite recently devel-
oped techniques, SRP remains the most
important part of periodontal disease treat-
ment.1 The classic devices used for root
surface debridement are oscillating scalers
and hand instruments.2,3 The beneficial
effects of scalers and hand instruments
combined with personal plaque control in
patients undergoing SRP have been verified.
These benefits include reduction of clinical
inflammation, microbial shifts to a less
pathogenic subgingival flora, a decreased
probing depth (PD), and increased clinical
attachment. However, as the pocket depth
increases, the efficiency of plaque elimin-
ation may decrease.4 Dragoo5 and Clifford
et al.6 assessed traditional and `microultra-
sonic' scaling tips with respect to their
capacity to achieve the most apical extension
of the periodontal pockets; however, they
obtained contradictory results. Dragoo5
reported that only a few of the instruments
reached the most apical depth of the pocket.
In contrast, Clifford et al.6 reported that
both types of scaling tips could reach and
debride dental plaque in pockets with depths
of 4 to 6 mm and 7 mm. The literature
contains various reports supporting success-
ful long-term maintenance following trad-
itional air-polishing treatment.4
Dental plaque progresses from aerobic,
gram-positive colonisation to anaerobic col-
onisation favouring gram-negative growth.
As bacterial plaque develops, the oxygen
level drops to zero, favouring decreased
oxygen conditions and the production of
odoriferous volatiles.7 Oxygen is consumed
by bacteria that utilise oxygen to oxidise
substrates (anaerobes) from saliva and gin-
gival fluid. Studies have suggested that peri-
odontitis increases the severity of halitosis.8
The bleeding tendency of the periodontal
tissues may supply fundamental substrates
for odour production. When periodontal
tissues are inflamed, they provide more
methionine, which is changed into methyl
mercaptan at a higher rate than in healthy
gingival tissues. The increased gingival
crevicular fluid flow in the presence of
periodontitis may be a constant source of
methionine. Increased salivary putrefaction
may occur due to a higher concentration of
disintegrated epithelial cells.9 A few reviews
have suggested that the production of vola-
tile sulphur compounds (VSCs) by these
gram-negative bacteria may contribute to
the improvement of periodontal disease via
breakdown of the oral mucosa, prompting
bacterial invasion.10
Air polishing using a conventional air-
polishing device with fine-grain (DV90:
63 mm) glycine powder aimed directly into
the periodontal pocket has been demon-
strated to be efficacious and safe for remov-
ing the subgingival biofilm in periodontal
pockets. In one study, glycine powder air-
polishing (GPAP) reduced the total viable
bacterial counts in periodontal pockets with
PDs ranging from 3 to 5 mm and to a
significantly greater extent than SRP using
curettes.11 However, no studies have inves-
tigated the efficacy of using GPAP adjunc-
tively with SRP in the treatment of halitosis.
Therefore, the aim of this clinical study was
to evaluate the effect of using GPAP
adjunctively with SRP on periodontal par-
ameters and halitosis.
Materials and methods
In the present trial, 60 patients (age range,
28­68 years) who had at least three
teeth with 4- to 6-mm periodontal pockets
were recruited from patients undergoing
periodontal treatment at the Department
of Periodontology of our institution. The
exclusion criteria were acute infectious oral
Caygur et al. 1169
lesions, furcation defects, use of antibiotics
for any reason within the last 4 weeks,
periodontal treatment within the last 6
months, and pregnancy or lactation.
Patient standardisation
All patients were instructed to avoid spicy
food containing ingredients such as garlic,
onions, and peppers as well as alcoholic
drinks and mouthwashes for 2 days prior to
halimetry. On the day of the examination,
the patients were instructed to avoid coffee,
candy, chewing gum, breath mints, per-
fumes, deodorants, shampoos, creams, and
scented moisturisers. They were also advised
to have breakfast at least 2 h and no more
than 4 h before the examination.
Periodontal examination
The plaque index (PI),12 gingival index
(GI),13 clinical attachment level (CAL),
PD, position of the gingival margin, and
bleeding on probing (BOP) were measured
at baseline and 1 month after treatment by a
single calibrated examiner who was not
aware of the type of treatment applied.
The PI, GI, PD, position of the gingival
margin, and BOP were evaluated with a
periodontal probe at six sites on all teeth.
BOP was assessed by the percentage of sites
that bled after probing.
Evaluation of VSCs
A portable sulphide monitor (Halimeter,
#RH17K; Interscan Corp., Chatsworth,
CA, USA) was used to assess the VSC
levels. Measurements using the Halimeter
were taken according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Three Halimeter readings were
taken, and the calculated average was rec-
orded as ppd. Halimeter measurements were
performed at baseline, immediately after
treatment, and on days 7, 14, and 30.
Study design
This was a computer-randomised, single-
blind, controlled clinical study. After being
given verbal information about the treat-
ment plan and potential discomforts
and risks, the patients who provided written
informed consent were included in the
study. The study protocol and related
consent forms were approved by the
Ethics Committee of Near East University
(# NEU/2015/33-236). All patients had pre-
viously undergone and completed initial
periodontal therapy. The patients were
divided into two groups. In the control
group, SRP was performed using an ultra-
sonic scaler (Piezon Master 700; Electro
Medical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland) and
hand instrumentation. In the test group, in
addition to SRP with ultrasonic and hand
instrumentation, GPAP (Air-Flow Perio
Powder; Electro Medical Systems) was per-
formed for 10 seconds per periodontal
pocket using a Perio-Flow device (Air-
Flow Master; Electro Medical Systems).
Statistical analysis
The mean values of the clinical parameters
were calculated for all groups. One-way
repeated analysis of variance was used to
evaluate the changes in VSC values over
time within the groups. Post hoc compari-
sons were performed using Tukey's test
when significance was detected. A t-test
was used for comparison among groups
at each time point. Changes in periodontal
parameters after treatment were assessed
by paired t-tests in dependent groups.
Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistic-
ally significant.
Results
All 60 patients completed the 1-month study
period. The changes in the PI, GI, PD, BOP,
1170 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
and CAL in the control and test groups are
presented in Table 1. In both groups, the PI,
GI, PD, BOP, and CAL gain scores were
significantly lower at 1 month than at base-
line. However, there were no significant
differences in the PI, GI, PD, BOP, or
CAL at the intragroup comparisons. The
changes in the VSC values in both groups
are presented in Table 2. The VSC values
were significantly different between baseline
and 1 month in both groups. However,
the intergroup comparisons of the VSC
values showed no significant differences at
any time point.
Discussion
Dental plaque in the periodontal pocket and
on the root surface was recently shown
to cause changes in biological structure.
Bacterial exotoxins that penetrate the root
surface, antibody complexes, and microbial
metabolism lead to these changes.14 The
efficacy of periodontal therapy is directly
related to the percentage of bacteria in
the pocket.15 Mechanical debridement con-
stitutes the initial and arguably most critical
method of managing inflammatory peri-
odontal disease. Based on measurable end-
points, mechanical debridement is generally
recognised for its effectiveness. These
endpoints include CAL, PD, BOP, and
alterations in the subgingival microflora.4
Effective root surface debridement is diffi-
cult to perform because of anatomic limi-
tations.16 Therefore, the use of GPAP
may simplify periodic subgingival instru-
mentation and may be an alternative to
the conventional techniques of subgingival
biofilm removal.11
The present study revealed that mechan-
ical instrumentation and GPAP had the
same effect on PI scores when used in
periodontal pockets with moderate PDs.
Similarly, Flemmig et al.17 showed that
hand instrumentation and GPAP had the
same effect on PI when used in periodontal
pockets with PDs of up to approximately 3
to 5 mm.

Because the use of low-abrasive powder
led to a significantly higher reduction in
subgingival bacteria than hand instrumen-
tation, it may be speculated that the clinical
outcomes of periodontal maintenance ther-
apy using subgingival air polishing may be
equivalent to or even better than the clinical
outcomes of conventional modes of debride-
ment.18 In our study, the PD and BOP
scores decreased in both groups, but the
difference between the groups was not stat-
istically significant. Similarly, Mu
¨ ller et al.19
also found a significant decrease in the PD
and BOP in their ultrasonic and Perio-Flow
groups when used with SRP at 3-month
intervals, but no significant difference was
found between the two groups. GPAP has
been shown to be more efficient in debriding
deep periodontal sites than SRP using
curettes. The mean time needed to treat
one deep periodontal site was 0.5 minutes
for GPAP alone compared with 1.4 minutes
for SRP.20 Our results suggest that some of
the classic methods are already sufficient
because the pocket depths in the study were
moderately deep.
Some researchers have found that
intraoral bacteria metabolise desquamated
epithelial cells and blood cells, leading to the
production of VSCs from cysteine and
methionine and thus increasing the VSC
scores parallel to an increase in the gingival
bleeding scores.21­23 Many studies have also
shown that periodontal diseases cause an
increase in VSC values, which then decrease
after periodontal treatment.24 In the present
study, the decrease in halitosis values was
statistically significant at the end of treat-
ment in both groups.
Tonzetich25 reported that VSC produc-
tion is associated with the periodontal
pocket depth and the presence of deep
periodontal pockets. A periodontal pocket
is an ideal environment for VSC formation
with respect to current bacterial profiles
and sulphur sources.7 The amount of
VSCs in the mouth increases in proportion
to the depth of the periodontal pockets.
Koshimune et al.26 found a statistically
significant relationship between VSC values
and the presence of periodontal pocket
depths of >4 mm and BOP. In another
study, hydrogen sulphide production in
periodontal pockets was semi-quantitatively
measured and found to have a positive
correlation between the periodontal pocket
depth and the amount of hydrogen sul-
phide.27 In the present study, both treatment
modalities resulted in a significant reduction
in VSC values, and the PD was found to
be significant. Another study by Morita
and Wang7 revealed a statistically significant
difference between halitosis and BOP.
So
¨ der et al.28 reported a positive correlation
among halitosis, poor oral hygiene, peri-
odontal disease, and BOP. No study has
investigated the efficacy of GPAP in halitosis
treatment; thus, we could not conduct a
comparison. Additionally, the use of GPAP
for deep periodontal pockets may be more
effective in the treatment of halitosis, but
further information is needed.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that there is a positive
correlation between halitosis and periodon-
tal disease. Within the limits of the present
study, SRP is effective in the treatment of
periodontitis and halitosis; however, using
GPAP adjunctively with mechanical instru-
mentation has no beneficial effects on hali-
tosis and periodontal parameters.
