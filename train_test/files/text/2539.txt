Abstract
Physiological correlates of behavioral and emotional prob-
lems, substance use onset and initiation of risky sexual be-
havior have not been studied in adolescents with prenatal
drug exposure. We studied the concordance between base-
line respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at age 3 and baseline
cortisol levels at age 11. We hypothesized that children who
showed concordance between RSA and cortisol would have
lower neurobehavioral disinhibition scores which would in
turn predict age of substance use onset and first sexual in-
tercourse. The sample included 860 children aged 16 years
participating in the Maternal Lifestyle Study, a multisite lon-
gitudinal study of children with prenatal exposure to co-
caine and other substances. Structural equation modeling

cohol by age 16. Among boys, there also existed a significant
baseline RSA by baseline cortisol interaction. Boys with low
baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol had the highest lev-
els of behavioral dysregulation. This increase in behavioral
dysregulation was in turn related to initiation of alcohol use
by age 16 and lower age of first sexual intercourse. We found
sex-specific pathways to the initiation of alcohol use and
risky sexual behavior through the combined activity of para-
sympathetic and neuroendocrine functioning. The study of
multiple physiological systems may suggest new pathways
to the study of age of onset of substance use and engage-
ment in risky sexual behavior in adolescents.

Introduction
Children with prenatal drug exposure are more likely
to exhibit problems with behavioral and emotional regu-
lation, initiate the use of substances and engage in risky
sexual behavior earlier compared to their unexposed
counterparts [1, 2]. However, the underlying physiologi-
cal processes that may be contributing to this increased
risk of poor behavioral outcomes has not been well stud-
ied. Recent work highlights the importance of studying
multiple physiological systems in order to achieve a more
accurate picture of behavioral functioning compared to
studying one system in isolation [3]. In this study we fo-
cused on the parasympathetic and neuroendocrine sys-
tems, giving evidence that both are predictive of behav-
ioral regulation later in life [4­6].
Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is an index of the
parasympathetic nervous system and is a phenomenon
whereby the heart rate shows high frequency variability in
time with respiration [4]. High baseline RSA reflects the
functional relationship between the central nervous sys-
tem and the heart as mediated by the vagus [7, 8] and is
related to neural integrity and readiness to respond to en-
vironmental stressors [4]. It may be an important predic-
tor of behavioral and emotional functioning later in life [4,
9­11]. Cortisol is one of the hormonal products of the lim-
bic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system. The
neuroendocrine and parasympathetic systems do not op-
erate in isolation [12]. Both the neuroendocrine and auto-
nomic nervous systems are mediated by the limbic fore-
brain, hypothalamus and brainstem [13], thought of as the
central autonomic network [14]. This network regulates
the parasympathetic nervous system directly and HPA ac-
tivity via the amygdala. Only one study that we know of
has examined relations between baseline cortisol, baseline
RSA and measures of problem behavior in older children.
In this study, children with both high baseline RSA and
high baseline cortisol, or low baseline RSA and low base-
line cortisol, had low levels of depressive symptoms in 1 of
the 4 models tested, while in the other 3 models, children
with high baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol had the
lowest levels of depression and anxiety [12].
In previous work we found that prenatal cocaine expo-
sure predicted neurobehavioral disinhibition in adoles-
cents, which in turn was related to the initiation of sub-
stance use [1]. Neurobehavioral disinhibition is a singular
multiproblem dimension involving lack of behavior con-
trol and poor emotional modulation that has features of
disruptive behavior disorders, affective and anxiety disor-
ders, cognitive impairment, and poor self-control. Here,
we examine whether individual differences in parasympa-
thetic and neuroendocrine functioning predict neurobe-
havioral disinhibition and, in turn, drug use and risky sex-
ualbehavioroutcomes.Basedontheexistingliterature,we
hypothesize that children who exhibit concordance be-
tween their parasympathetic and neuroendocrine systems
will have the lowest levels of neurobehavioral disinhibi-
tion and, in turn, will initiate the use of substances later
and have a later onset of age of first sexual intercourse.
Given that both drug use and risky sexual behavior out-
comes may differ between the sexes [15, 16], we tested our
models separately for males and females.
Methods
Participants
We used data from 1,388 participants drawn from the Maternal
Lifestyle Study, a multisite investigation of the effects of prenatal
substance exposure in a longitudinal follow-up from 1 month to 16
years. In the present study data were used from the birth visit and
when children were aged 3, 11 and 13 years. Participants were re-
cruited from Detroit, Mich., Memphis, Tenn., Miami, Fla., and
Providence,R.I.,USA.TheMaternalLifestyleStudysampleincludes
children in the following racial and ethnic categories: African
American (77%), Caucasian (16%), Hispanic (6%), and children
whose parents identified other racial or ethnic backgrounds (1%).
Details on the enrollment and exclusion criteria are described else-
where [17]. In brief, the families were selected for the exposed group
(maternal report of cocaine or opiate use during pregnancy or gas
chromatography ­ mass spectrometry confirmation of presumptive
positive meconium screens for cocaine or opiate metabolites) or the
comparison group (maternal denial of cocaine or opiate use during
pregnancy and a negative enzyme multiplied immunoassay meco-
nium screen for cocaine and opiate metabolites). The exposed and
comparison youths were group matched on race, gender and gesta-
tional age within each study site. Background substances associated
with cocaine use (alcohol, tobacco and marijuana) were present in
both groups; thus, most participants were polysubstance exposed.

The study was approved by the institutional review board at
each study site, and written informed consent (from caregivers)
was obtained for all participants. Each site had a certificate of con-
fidentiality from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).
Examiners were blinded to group status.
Measures
Polysubstance Exposure
Prenatal substance exposure was measured as a summative in-
dex ranging from 0 to 5 for use of cocaine, opiates, marijuana, al-
cohol and tobacco during pregnancy, as previously reported [18].
Maternal report/meconium screen of drug use (1 = yes, 0 = no)
prenatally was computed; 1 point was assigned for each substance
used. Dichotomous measures are frequently used in testing prena-
tal substance exposure effects [18, 19].
Early Adversity
Early adversity was a summative risk index assessment from
birth to age 3 and included 9 risk factors. Each risk factor was
either a continuous scale or a count score that was dichoto-
mized to create an overall risk index (0 = no/none, 1 = yes/1 or
more).
Maternal Report of Postnatal Substance Use
Any maternal report of postnatal substance use of cocaine, opi-
ates, tobacco, alcohol or marijuana up to the year 3 assessment was
assessed using the Caretaker Inventory of Substance Use [20].
Chronic Poverty Status
Chronic poverty status was calculated as income below USD
10,000 for at least 75% of the visits.
Low Social Status
Low social status was scored from the Hollingshead Index of
Social Position [21]. Education and occupation were averaged over
annual visits. Participants received 1 point if their Index of Social
Position score fell 1 standard deviation (SD) or more below the
mean.
Primary Caretaker Changes
The presence of primary caretaker changes was assessed
annually.
Sexual or Physical Abuse or Neglect
Caregivers were interviewed about whether or not there had
been any reports of sexual or physical abuse and/or neglect annu-
ally from the birth to age 3 assessment.
Caregiver Depression
Children received 1 point on the cumulative risk index if assess-
ments of caregiver depression were 1 SD or greater above the mean
for averaged depressive symptoms on the caregiver-reported Beck
Depression Inventory [22] at ages 4 months ( = 0.88) and 2.5
years ( = 0.89).
Caregiver Psychological Distress
This risk item was calculated as present if assessments of care-
giver psychological distress were 1 SD or greater above the mean
for total psychological symptoms on the Brief Symptom Inventory
[23] at ages 4 months ( = 0.96) and 2.5 years ( = 0.96).
Home Environment
This risk item was coded as present if scores fell 1 SD or more
below the mean on the Home Observation Measurement of the
Environment [24] as assessed by a home visitor when the child was
10 months old ( = 0.83).
History of Child Protective Services Involvement
If the child had any history of Child Protective Services involve-
ment, assessed annually by caregiver report until the year 3 assess-
ment, then 1 point was given on this risk index.
Baseline RSA
Baseline RSA was measured at age 3 because of research sug-
gesting that RSA in early childhood is predictive of later behav-
ioral problems [25, 26]. RSA was derived from the R-R time series
collected from digitized ECG recordings using Porges algorithm
from MXEdit [27]. ECGs were recorded via three electrodes
placed on the child's chest and abdomen. The ECG signal was
sampled at 1 kHz and stored on a computer for later scoring. In-
terbeat intervals were defined by detection of R-waves to the near-
est millisecond.
Postprocessing of the data took place off-line by using a series
of automated algorithms. R-R intervals outside of expected values
were identified. Missed or spurious R-waves were flagged and cor-
rected by linear interpolation. A 21-point moving polynomial was
then applied to remove low frequency trends in the HR signal.
Next, a bandpass filter extracted the variance in heart period with-
in the frequency band of spontaneous respiration in young chil-
dren (0.24­1.04 Hz). This process removes periodicities in the
ECG signal that are outside the frequency range of the respiratory
cycle. The resulting measure of RSA is in the frequency range of
respiration. RSA was computed as the natural logarithm of heart
period variance and reported in units of milliseconds squared and
is one of several acceptable approaches for calculating RSA [28].
RSA data were calculated in 30-second overlapping windows and
then averaged within each episode (baseline and attention task).
The RSA data for an individual was used as long as there was a
30-second segment with less than 20% of segments identified with
artifact [29], which is the shortest duration recommended when
calculating RSA with children ­ 30-second epochs are frequently
sampled in studies of young children [30­33]. In addition, small
amounts of artifact can be expected to have a minimal effect on
measures of heart rate variability such as RSA [7].
Baseline RSA was assessed during a nonchallenge `control' task.
Specifically, children played with a toy alone or with an experi-
menter for an average of 164.8 s (range = 135.6­199.3) while sitting
at a table. Although this baseline required some attention, which
may evoke vagal withdrawal [34], the toy with which the child
played was simple and no task demands were placed on the child
during this time.
Baseline Cortisol
Baseline cortisol was measured at age 11 because by this age the
effects of early adversity and prenatal substance exposure may
have become biologically embedded to impact the limbic-hypo-
thalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical response to stress. Further-
more, the kind of problem behavior we examined in this study,
including the initiation of alcohol use and risky sexual behavior, is
more likely to manifest in adolescence as opposed to childhood.
Baseline cortisol was collected 20 min before the start of a social

stress task and involved children filling out questionnaires on top-
ics that were innocuous and familiar to the child from previous
visits (e.g. extracurricular activity, ethnic identity and nutrition
questionnaires). It took approximately 20 min to fill out these
questionnaires. We chose this task before the stress task because
we wanted to control for individual differences in the type of activ-
ity the child was engaged in before coming to the laboratory and
to control for differences in the car ride to the laboratory.
To collect the samples, the child deposited saliva through a
straw directly into a 2-ml vial. Ideally, the samples were 1.0 ml but
0.5 ml was accepted if the collection time was over 3 min. The vials
were prelabeled with study site, ID and sample type with unique
barcodes (provided by Salimetrics LLC). Samples were immedi-
ately placed in a ­20°C freezer until shipped on dry ice to Salimet-
ricsLaboratory[35]forassay.Allsampleswereassayedinduplicate

g/dl and a range of sensitivity from 0.007 to 1.8 g/dl. Mean intra-
assay and interassay coefficients of variation were less than 5 and
10% averaged duplicate scores were used in all analyses; 97% of
participants provided the prestress sample between 11:00 a.m. and
5:00 p.m. to address the diurnal cycle of cortisol that flattens be-
tweenlatemorningandearlyevening.Theearliestprestresssample
was 10:37 a.m. and the last was 5:10 p.m. We also collected infor-
mation on steroid medications, time of last meal or beverage in-
cluding dairy or caffeine, and vigorous physical exercise.
The raw cortisol values (microgram/deciliter) were positively
skewed and normalized using a log transformation. Outliers above
or below 3 SD in all 3 samples and the difference score were win-
sorized by replacing the value with the value at 3 SD (<1.5% of
cortisol values were affected).
Neurobehavioral Disinhibition
Based on previous work [1, 18], 2 construct scores were em-
ployed to assess neurobehavioral disinhibition at age 13/14. The
construct scores for behavioral dysregulation and executive dys-
function were computed from multimethod, multiagent, validat-
ed, well-established measures. The neurobehavioral disinhibition
construct has good predictive validity, particularly in its ability to
predict substance use onset, and good construct, discriminative
and concurrent validity, as well as good test-retest and internal re-
liability [36].
Behavioral Dysregulation. The behavioral dysregulation con-
struct was a composite score of 6 measures of internalizing and
externalizing problems: (1) problem behaviors reported by care-
givers on the Child Behavior Checklist [37] using the standardized
T scores for total problem behaviors at age 13; (2) oppositional
defiance disorder; (3) conduct disorder; (4) attention deficit disor-
der; (5) major depression symptom counts reported by the parent
from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children ­ IV [38] at
age 14, and (6) delinquency summary scores for the number of
self-reported crimes against people and acts of general delinquen-
cy and school delinquency from the Things That You Have Done
questionnaire [39, 40] at age 13.
The composite was computed as the average of the 3 indicators
with higher scores indicating more behavioral dysregulation.
Cronbach's alpha was 0.80 for the composite score of behavioral
dysregulation. Using principal components factor analyses, we ob-
tained a single-factor solution: an eigenvalue of 3.25, explained
over 50% of the variance.
Executive Dysfunction. This was measured with 2 computer-
ized tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automat-
ed Batteries [41] at age 13. There is variability in the indicators that
researchers use to measure executive dysfunction as a component
of neurobehavioral disinhibition. We chose tasks that assess spatial
working memory, thinking time and planning, all of which have
been shown to be related to brain areas related to deficiencies
among children exposed prenatally to drugs [42]. The spatial
working memory task is self-ordered and requires the respondent
to find a `token' in an array of colored boxes; we measured the to-
tal number of errors in the task. The Stockings of Cambridge task
involves spatial planning, and the respondents must use `balls' in
one display to copy the pattern shown in another display. Thinking
time includes 2 trials measuring the time to select the initial stim-
ulus. Shorter times have been related to impulsivity. We measured
the total number of correct solutions in the minimal number of
moves (reverse scored to indicate executive dysfunction). The
composite score was the average of the 2 indicators rescaled to 0­1,
with higher scores indicating more executive dysfunction.
Substance Use
Substance use was measured with the Things That You Have
Done questionnaire yearly from ages 8 to 16. Use of each substance
(alcohol, tobacco and marijuana) was coded as yes or no (dummy-
coded as 1 and 0, respectively); 3 dichotomous variables were com-
puted based on the subject's report of use at any age: alcohol only,
tobacco only or marijuana only.
Age of first sexual intercourse
Age of first sexual intercourse was reported by the adolescent
at age 16 using the Adolescent Sexual Behavior Assessment [43].
The age the adolescent first engaged in any type of intercourse
(vaginal or anal with the same or opposite sex) was recorded. Low-
er levels (compared to higher levels) of this variable indicate that
children were younger when they first engaged in sexual inter-
course.
Statistical Analysis
We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test pathways
between prenatal substance exposure, early adversity, physiologi-
cal functioning and our behavioral, drug use and sexual behavior
outcomes. All predictors were grand-mean centered and assump-
tions of normality were tested prior to inclusion in the model. As
our interest was in the concordance between parasympathetic and
neuroendocrine systems we only present SEM models in which the
interaction between baseline RSA and baseline cortisol was statis-
tically significant. Following Aiken and West [44], interactions
were probed at ±1 SD from the mean of baseline RSA and baseline
cortisol using the online-computational tools provided by Preach-
er et al. [45].
Covariates
Because of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol, we examined wheth-
er the time of prestress cortisol measurement was correlated with
the baseline cortisol value. Time of measurement was not signifi-
cantly related with the time-specific measurement of cortisol (r =
­0.05, p = 0.15). We also examined whether prescription and/or
nonprescription steroid medication impacted cortisol concentra-
tions. Steroid use within the last 12 hours was not significantly as-
sociated with baseline cortisol (r = 0.05, p = 0.16). No one reported

eating or drinking beverages within 1 h of the baseline sample or
vigorous exercise within 1.75 h of the baseline sample.
We also examined variables that have been shown in previous
studies to covary with baseline cortisol and/or RSA. These variables
include child sex, race and gestational age. Race, sex and gestational
age were not associated with baseline cortisol (all p > 0.13). Race and
sex were associated with baseline RSA (p < 0.03) so they were in-
cluded as covariates in our SEM models. We also included executive
dysfunction at age 9 or behavioral dysregulation at age 9 as covari-
ates. Because males and females may differ with respect to their drug
use and risky sexual behavior, we used a multiple group SEM frame-
work to test pathways between prenatal substance exposure, early
adversity, baseline RSA, baseline cortisol, and our outcomes. This
approach allowed us to examine whether the same structural model

Results
At age 11, there were 860 children with cortisol data.
From the original 1,388 children (assessed 11 years ear-
lier), 388 did not participate in the visit at 11 years. A fur-
ther 115 children did not participate in the cortisol reac-
tivity task due to chronic disability (n = 57), child or par-
ent unable or refusal (n = 14), or technical problems or
resource limitations (n = 44). Of the 885 who participated
in the cortisol reactivity task, 22 had an incomplete pro-
cedure or saliva collection and 3 were excluded because
the quantity of saliva was insufficient.
We analyzed whether there were differences in prena-
tal substance exposure or early adversity among children
with and without missing cortisol data. No differences
were found in exposure to substances prenatally or expo-
sure to early adversity between children with and without
cortisol data (all F  2.85, all p  0.09, all 2  0.002).
Missing data were accounted for using the full informa-
tion maximum likelihood feature of Mplus, which uses
all available information from the observed data to pro-
vide statistically appropriate standard errors.
Of the 860 total participants, there were 41 youths who
experienced no early adverse events and 178 youths with-
out prenatal substance exposure. Both the prenatal sub-
stance exposure and early adversity variables are continu-
ous. Inspection of data for outliers revealed that both
variables were normally distributed. That the prenatal
substance exposure variable was normally distributed is
not surprising given that we oversampled for substance
exposure in this study.
Model 1: Executive Dysfunction, Drug Use, and Risky
Sexual Behavior
In the first model we examined pathways from prena-
tal substance exposure, early adversity, baseline cortisol
and baseline RSA to executive dysfunction and drug use
and risky sexual behavior outcomes. The interaction be-
tween RSA and cortisol was statistically significant in fe-
males but not in males (fig. 1). The model fit was ade-
quate, with 2(28) = 67.31, p < 0.001, comparative fit in-
dex (CFI) = 0.91 and standardized root mean square
residual (SMSR) = 0.04.
Among females, greater levels of baseline RSA were
related to greater baseline cortisol at age 11. Greater ex-

ecutive dysfunction at age 9 and greater early adversity
were related to greater executive dysfunction at age 13.
The interaction between baseline RSA at age 3 and base-
line cortisol at age 11 was also a significant predictor of
executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction, in turn,
predicted the initiation of alcohol use by age 16 such that
greater executive dysfunction indicated an increased like-
lihood that the child had used alcohol by age 16. Race was
also a significant predictor of baseline RSA. Post hoc tests
revealed that African Americans had significantly greater
baseline RSA compared to Caucasians, Hispanics and
those who identified themselves as `other'.
We probed the significant RSA and cortisol interac-
tion at 1 SD above and below the mean for baseline RSA
and baseline cortisol (fig. 2). Executive dysfunction was
lower among girls whose baseline cortisol and baseline
RSA were concordant; that is, if both were high or both
were low. Girls with either high baseline RSA and low
baseline cortisol or low baseline RSA and high baseline
cortisol had the highest levels of executive dysfunction.
There were no differences in prenatal substance or early
adversity exposure among these groups.
Model 2: Behavioral Dysregulation, Drug Use, and
Risky Sexual Behavior
In the second model we examined pathways from pre-
natal substance exposure, early adversity, baseline corti-
sol and baseline RSA to behavioral dysregulation and
drug use and risky sexual behavior outcomes. Statistically
significant interactions between RSA and cortisol were
only found in males.
Initiation of Alcohol Use

in the males was adequate, with 2(28) = 73.91, p < 0.001,

nificant predictors of baseline cortisol. Race was a signifi-
cant predictor of baseline RSA at 3 years. Behavioral dys-
regulationatage9andgreaterprenataldrugexposurepre-
dicted greater behavioral dysregulation at age 13. Greater
levels of prenatal substance exposure were associated with
behavioral dysregulation at age 13. The interaction be-
tween baseline RSA and baseline cortisol predicted behav-
ioral dysregulation at age 13. Greater behavioral dysregu-
lation, in turn, was related to an increased likelihood that
the adolescent had initiated alcohol use by age 16.
We probed the significant RSA and cortisol interac-
tion at 1 SD above and below the mean for baseline RSA
and baseline cortisol (fig. 4). The lowest levels of behav-
ioral dysregulation were found among boys with both
high baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol. Boys with
low baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol had the high-
est levels of behavioral dysregulation. There were no dif-
ferences in behavioral dysregulation among boys with
low baseline cortisol, regardless of their baseline RSA lev-
els. There were no differences in prenatal substance or
early adversity exposure among these groups.

The model fit testing the pathway to age of first sexual
intercourse in the males was adequate, with 2(28) = 62.75,
p < 0.001, CFI = 0.93 and SMSR = 0.05 (fig. 5). There were

ioral dysregulation at age 9 and greater prenatal drug ex-
posure predicted greater behavioral dysregulation at age
13. The same interaction between baseline RSA and base-
line cortisol predicting behavioral dysregulation at age 13
also held for this model. Greater behavioral dysregulation,
in turn, predicted a lower age of first sexual intercourse.
There were no differences in prenatal substance or early

Discussion
We investigated whether physiological functioning
across the parasympathetic and neuroendocrine systems
would be predictive of neurobehavioral disinhibition and
maladaptive outcomes in adolescence among children
with prenatal substance exposure. The interaction be-
tweenbaselineRSAandbaselinecortisolpredictedunique
aspects of neurobehavioral disinhibition, separately for
males and females. Neurobehavioral disinhibition in turn
predicted the initiation of alcohol use and age of first sex-
ual intercourse. These results highlight the importance of
studying interactions between physiological systems to
predict important developmental outcomes. They also
demonstrate that unique developmental pathways to
these poor outcomes may exist separately for males and
females.
The interaction between baseline RSA and baseline
cortisol was predictive of both executive dysfunction and
behavioral dysregulation, though in different ways for
males and females. Females who exhibited discordance in
baseline RSA and baseline cortisol (those who exhibited
high levels in one system and low levels in another) had
the highest levels of executive dysfunction. Higher levels
of executive dysfunction in turn predicted the initiation
of alcohol use by age 16. The literature examining sex dif-
ferences in executive functioning is small and equivocal,
though some research suggests that planning may devel-
op later for girls than boys [46], which may have made
girls in this study more vulnerable to the initiation of al-
cohol use.
Discordance between baseline RSA and baseline corti-
sol was also found in the one other study that we know of
investigating baseline effects in both the parasympathetic
and neuroendocrine systems [12]. In this study, both
males and females were more likely to exhibit symptoms
of depression if discordant in baseline RSA and baseline
cortisol. It is not surprising that children with low base-
line RSA and high baseline cortisol would exhibit execu-
tive dysfunction, as this profile is reflective of poor emo-
tional regulation and greater physiological arousal, both
of which are associated with poorer performance on ex-
ecutive functioning tasks [47]. It is less clear why a pattern
of high baseline RSA and low baseline cortisol would be
associated with executive dysfunction, though it may be
that discordance across systems is a stronger predictor of
executive dysfunction rather than the specific pattern of
parasympathetic and neuroendocrine responding. For
instance, in their description of autonomic space, Bern-
tson et al. [48] note that when the parasympathetic and
sympathetic nervous systems are reciprocally activated
(when there is activation in the parasympathetic nervous
system and deactivation in the sympathetic nervous sys-
tem or vice versa) the organism may be better suited to
deal with survival challenges. Perhaps over the long term,
consistent with the theory of allostatic load, this recipro-
cal activation needed to manage challenge may lead to
wear and tear and subsequent `burn-out' of these systems,
which is observed functionally in this study by poorer ex-
ecutive function in girls. In addition, for girls only, great-
er early adversity was also associated with executive dys-
function. Therefore, the combination of wear and tear on
both the parasympathetic and neuroendocrine systems as
well as the experience of early adversity may have resulted
in poorer executive functioning and subsequently the ini-
tiation of alcohol use by age 16.
Among boys, there too existed a significant baseline
RSA by baseline cortisol interaction, though in boys this
interaction was predictive of behavioral dysregulation.
This increase in behavioral dysregulation was in turn re-
lated to initiation of alcohol use by age 16 and lower age
of first sexual intercourse. Again, the literature on sex dif-
ferences in behavior control and substance use is small
and equivocal. In one study, the relation between behav-
ioral regulation (in the form of self-restraint) and sub-
stance use was stronger for boys than girls [49], though in
another study this effect was stronger in girls [50]. Some
literature, however, suggests that girls mature more
quickly than boys in the domain of behavioral regulation,
such that by age 11 it may be that the boys who have not
`caught up' with the girls are at increased risk of initiating
alcohol use and engaging in risky sexual behavior. It is
interesting to note that behavioral dysregulation at age 9
was associated with behavioral dysregulation at age 13 in
males but not in females, suggesting that this cluster of
behavioral problems emerges earlier in males, which
could also reflect sex differences in maturation.
The interaction between baseline RSA and baseline
cortisol was significantly predictive of behavioral dysreg-
ulation, though in a slightly different way. Male children
with low baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol had the
greatest levels of behavioral dysregulation while children
with high baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol had the
lowest levels. These findings fit with the hypothesis posed
by El-Sheikh et al. [12] that poor physiological regulation
in the form of low baseline RSA and greater arousal in the
form of high baseline cortisol is a risk factor for poor be-
havioral regulation. In this study, we extend previous
work as we have found that this profile of physiological
responding was related to behavioral dysregulation, while

El-Sheikh et al. found this profile was related to internal-
izing behavior. It appears as though high baseline RSA
was protective in this sample, as high baseline cortisol in
addition to high baseline RSA was related to the lowest
levels of behavioral dysregulation for boys. Importantly,
these results replicate those of El-Sheikh et al. [12], who
found that this profile was related to the lowest levels of
internalizing symptoms. In these models prenatal sub-
stance exposure was also a significant predictor of behav-
ioral dysregulation. Prenatal substance exposure could
have affected the dopaminergic reward circuitry in the
brain and nucleus accumbens, affecting behavioral regu-
lation, cognitive control and impulsivity, all of which are
risk factors for the initiation of substance use and engag-
ing in risky sexual behavior [1].
A number of limitations should be acknowledged. Al-
though most of our physiological measures were evalu-
ated before symptom assessments, we still cannot infer
causality with these data. Future studies using a cross-
lagged approach will be helpful in understanding wheth-
er a physiological process at one point in time influences
behavior later in development. Furthermore, it is not
known whether baseline RSA and/or baseline cortisol are
related to our behavioral outcomes, over and above the
effects of baseline RSA and cortisol measured earlier in
life. We also did not isolate the effects of a single sub-
stance, such as cocaine, on our outcomes and instead used
a summary score approach, which may be a more eco-
logically valid indicator of prenatal substance use [51].
We acknowledge that the mechanism of action of these
drugs is different, and we cannot study the relative impact
of one drug over another. In addition, we chose measures
of executive dysfunction which have been shown to be
related to brain areas related to deficiencies among chil-
dren exposed prenatally to drugs [42]. However, there
may have been others (such as inhibitory control) that
could have been assessed.
This study reveals sex-specific pathways to the initia-
tion of alcohol use and risky sexual behavior through
parasympathetic and neuroendocrine functioning. These
results are important as they suggest that in order to bet-
ter understand which adolescents are more likely to initi-
ate substances and engage in risky sexual behavior we
should assess physiological functioning across a range of
systems, as opposed to studying them in isolation, as the
interaction between the parasympathetic and neuroen-
docrine system revealed which adolescents were more
likely to engage in these behaviors. Follow-up work
should continue to incorporate a multiple-levels-of-anal-
ysis perspective, focusing on physiological data from
multiple systems in addition to behavioral and even ge-
netic and epigenetic information to arrive at a more com-
plete picture of who may be at risk for the development
of substance use disorders and risky sexual behavior.
