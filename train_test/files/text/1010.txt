Objectives. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlates of religious participation among older Black
Caribbeans.
Methods. Data from the older Black Caribbean subsample of the National Survey of American Life were used to
examine selected measures of organizational, nonorganizational, and subjective religious participation.
Results. The findings indicated important demographic differences in the correlates of religious participation among
older Black Caribbeans. In particular, gender, marital status, income, immigration status, and denomination were
associated with religious participation.
Discussion. We discuss study findings in relation to available ethnographic data on Black Caribbeans and prior survey
research on religious participation among older African Americans. Although there were several similarities to the
research on older African Americans and religious involvement (e.g., marital status, gender, denomination), noted
departures from prior research findings (e.g., income effects) may indicate the influence of ethnic group membership and
the importance of the immigration experience in shaping distinctive life experiences for older Black Caribbeans.
BLACK Caribbeans constitute a significant percentage of
the African American population and represent a major
ethnic subgroup. According to the 2000 census, there were 1.5
million Black Caribbeans in the United States, which roughly
represents 4.5% of the Black population overall. This number
reflects an increase of 67% in the growth of the Black
Caribbean population from 1990 to 2000 (Logan & Deane,
2003). The Black Caribbean presence is especially evident in
several cities on the East Coast, such as New York, Boston,
Miami, and Fort Lauderdale, where at least 1 out of 5 African
Americans is of Caribbean descent (Logan & Deane, 2003).
Overall, Black Caribbeans currently outnumber Koreans and
Cubans and are growing at a faster rate than both of these
groups (Logan & Deane, 2003).
Black Caribbean immigration and settlement in the United
States has occurred continuously over a period of time dating
back to colonial era. Black Caribbeans represent a variety of
groups who, while having a shared heritage of African descent
and enslavement, differ with respect to national origin, lan-
guage, culture, and immigration history. The Black Caribbean
population in the United States, although undergoing signifi-
cant growth, is geographically concentrated in urban centers
on the East Coast and within so-called ethnic or immigrant
enclaves (neighborhoods with high percentages of Black
Caribbeans). Furthermore, as their immigration history sug-
gests, Black Caribbeans reflect a full range of experience in the
United States, from very recent arrivals to individuals who have
several generations of family (naturalized and native born)
who trace their ancestry to the Caribbean region. These factors,
coupled with their shared racial heritage and physical similari-
ties with native African Americans, have contributed to their
relative invisibility within American society.
Research on Black Caribbeans has been primarily restricted
to a limited number of qualitative and humanities-based studies.
As a consequence, researchers lack information concerning the
status of important subgroups (e.g., based on age, gender, socio-
economic position) within this population, and the perceptions
and unique life experiences of diverse members of this group.
For the purposes of this study, we were particularly interested
in the nature and pattern of religious involvement among
a specific subgroup of Black Caribbeans, that of older adults.
Investigating religious participation among older adults is par-
ticularly important because religious involvement provides
regular opportunities for interaction and informal support from
fellow church members, provides access to clergy and the
use of religiously based coping strategies (e.g., prayer) for
assistance with stressful life situations (e.g., health problems,
bereavement), and, overall, exerts a salutary influence on phys-
ical and mental health status and general well-being (see review
by Taylor, Chatters, & Levin, 2004).
Qualitative studies of Black Caribbeans have indicated that
the church has been an important institution and resource for
new immigrants and subsequent generations. Waters's (1999)
extensive qualitative study of racial and group identity among
Black Caribbeans in Brooklyn, New York, indicated that the
church plays a prominent role in Black Caribbean life. She
noted that many Black Caribbeans belong to an ethnically
rooted church in which the congregation is composed exclu-
sively of Black Caribbeans or, in some cases, individuals from
a specific Caribbean country. Black Caribbean churches fulfill
a dual function of providing spiritual and other forms of support
to members, as well as reinforcing social relationships and
connections with other immigrants. McEachern and Kenny
(2002) found that Black Caribbean women place great

emphasis on religion, arguing that these women share strong
religious ties and a sense of loyalty, moral obligation, and
respect for the church and its teachings (p. 55).
Systematic research on religious involvement among this
group is virtually nonexistent. Researchers currently have little
information regarding even the most fundamental aspects of
religious participation for the Black Caribbean population such
as denominational affiliation, rates of religious service atten-
dance and church membership, and types of prayer activities.
The situation is even more problematic with respect to
information about religious participation for the subgroup that
is of interest to this study, that of older Black Caribbeans.
Accordingly, the goal of the present study was to provide a
preliminary examination of the demographic correlates of reli-
gious participation among older Black Caribbeans. This article
builds upon recent work on race and ethnic differences in
religious participation (Taylor, Chatters, & Jackson, 2007).
METHODS
Sample
The Program for Research on Black Americans at the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research collected
the National Survey of American Life: Coping With Stress in
the 21st Century (NSAL). NSAL staff conducted a total of
6,082 face-to-face interviews with persons aged 18 or older,
including 3,570 African Americans, 891 non-Hispanic Whites,
and 1,621 Blacks of Caribbean descent (survey field period was
from 2001 to 2003). The NSAL includes the first major proba-
bility sample of Black Caribbeans ever conducted.
For the purposes of this study, we defined Black Caribbeans
as persons who (a) trace their ethnic heritage to a Caribbean
country but who now reside in the United States, (b) are racially
classified as Black, and (c) are English speaking (but may also
speak another language). There are 303 Black Caribbeans aged
55 and older who comprise the sample used in this study. The
overall response rate was 72.3%.
The African American sample is the core sample of the
NSAL. The core sample consists of 64 primary sampling units.
The Black Caribbean sample came from two area probability
sample frames: the core NSAL sample and an area probability
sample of housing units from geographic areas with a rela-
tively high density of persons of Caribbean descent. In both the
African American and Black Caribbean samples, it was
necessary for respondents to self-identify their race as Black.
Those self-identifying as Black were included in the Black
Caribbean sample if they answered affirmatively when asked if
they were of West Indian or Caribbean descent, if they said
they were from a country included on a list of Caribbean area
countries presented by the interviewers, or if they indicated that
their parents or grandparents had been born in a Caribbean area
country (see Jackson et al., 2004). The interviews were face to
face and conducted within respondents' homes. Respondents
were compensated for their time.
Measures
The present analysis investigated measures of organizational,
nonorganizational, and subjective religious participation. The
measures of organizational religious participation included
frequency of service attendance, church membership, and
frequency of participation in congregational activities. We
assessed frequency of religious service attendance by combin-
ing two questions: ``Other than for weddings or funerals, have
you attended services at a church or other place of worship
since you were 18 years old?'' (yes/no) and ``How often do you
usually attend religious services?'' The categories for this
combined variable were as follows: attend nearly every day,
attend at least once a week, a few times a month, a few times
a year, less than once a year, and never. We measured church
membership by the question ``Are you an official member of
a church or other place of worship?'' (yes/no). We measured
frequency of participation in congregational activities by the
question ``Besides regular service, how often do you take part
in other activities at your church? Would you say nearly every
day, at least once a week, a few times a month, a few times
a year, or never?''.
Nonorganizational religious participation comprised five
items: reading religious books or other religious materials,
watching religious programs on TV, listening to religious
programs on the radio, praying, and asking someone to pray for
you (Cronbach's a ¼ .74). Respondents indicated how often
they engaged in each of these activities: nearly every day, at
least once a week, a few times a month, at least once a month,
a few times a year, or never. Subjective religiosity comprised
four items: importance of religion while growing up, impor-
tance of parents taking or sending their children to religious
services, importance of religion in the respondent's life, and
how religious the respondent feels (Cronbach's a ¼ .88).
We included several demographic variables in this analysis
as independent variables, including age, gender, marital status,
education, family income, immigration status, and country of
origin. We imputed missing data for family income. Income
was coded in dollars and divided by 5,000 in order to increase
effect sizes and provide a better understanding of the net impact
of income. Immigration status had four categories: (a) respon-
dent was born in the United States, (b) respondent immigrated
to the United States less than 25 years ago, (c) respondent
immigrated to the United States between 26 and 35 years ago,
and (4) respondent immigrated to the United States 36 or more
years ago. Country of origin had four categories: Jamaica, other
English-speaking country (e.g., Barbados), Spanish-speaking
country (e.g., Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic), and Haiti.
We included denomination as an independent variable, mea-
sured by the question ``What is your current religion?''. This
sample of older Black Caribbeans mentioned more than 35
different denominations that were recoded into eight categories:
Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, Episcopal, Catholic, other
Protestant (e.g., Lutheran, Presbyterian), other religion (e.g.,
Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim), and none.
Analysis Strategy
We conducted this analysis using the svy:regress and the svy:
logit commands in Stata 9.2. All analyses were design based, in
that they (a) utilized sampling weights and (b) accounted for the
complex multistage design of the NSAL sample (i.e., clustering
and stratification) when computing standard errors.
RESULTS
Table 1 provides the distribution for the demographic and
denomination factors used in this analysis. Table 2 presents the

regressions of the religious involvement factors on the
demographic variables, controlling for denomination. Equation
1 is the regression for service attendance, Equation 2 presents
the logistic regression for whether the respondent was an offi-
cial member of a place of worship, Equation 3 is the regression
for frequency of participation in congregational activities, Equa-
tion 4 presents the regression for frequency of nonorganiza-
tional religious activities, and Equation 5 is the regression for
subjective religiosity.
As indicated in Equation 1, gender, marital status, education,
immigration status, and denomination were all significantly
associated with frequency of attending religious services.
Women attended religious services more frequently than men,
and education was positively associated with attendance.
Among the marital status groups, married respondents attended
religious services more frequently than separated, divorced, and
never-married persons. Immigration status differences indicated
that respondents who immigrated to the United States less than
25 years ago and between 26 and 35 years ago attended reli-
gious services more frequently than respondents who were born
in the United States. Baptists indicated attending religious
services more frequently than Catholics and persons who were
not affiliated with a denomination.
Equation 2 presents the results of the logistic regression of
demographic variables on whether the respondent was an
official member of a place of worship. Denomination was the
only variable that demonstrated a significant relationship.
Respondents who were Catholic and those who did not report
a denomination were less likely than Baptists to be official
members of a place of worship. Income, country of origin,
and denomination were significantly associated with frequency
of participation in congregational activities (Equation 3).
Respondents with lower incomes participated in congregational
activities more frequently than those with higher incomes.
Respondents from Jamaica participated in congregational acti-
vities more frequently than respondents from other English-
speaking countries. Denomination differences indicated that
Baptists participated in other activities at their place of wor-
ship more frequently than Episcopalians, Catholics, respond-
ents who identified other non-Christian religions, and those
who indicated that they did not have a religious denomination.
Gender, income, marital status, immigration status, and denom-
ination were all significantly associated with the frequency of
nonorganizational religious activities (Equation 4). Women and
respondents with lower incomes reported engaging in non-
organizational religious activities more frequently than men and
their higher income counterparts. Married respondents engaged
in nonorganizational religious activities more frequently than
their never-married counterparts. Respondents who immigrated
to the United States less than 25 years ago and those who
immigrated between 26 and 35 years ago reported engaging in
nonorganizational religious activities more frequently than older
Black Caribbeans who were born in the United States. Lastly,
Baptists reported less frequent nonorganizational activity than
respondents from Pentecostal churches but more frequent non-
organizational activity than Catholics, other Protestants, and
those who did not have a religious denomination. Income and
denomination were significantly associated with degree of sub-
jective religiosity (Equation 5). Respondents with lower incomes
indicated significantly higher levels of subjective religiosity than
their higher income counterparts. Lastly, Baptists reported
significantly higher levels of subjective religiosity than respond-
ents who were not affiliated with a religious denomination.
DISCUSSION
Overall, these findings are generally consistent with the
limited amount of previous research indicating that churches
and religion are an important aspect of the lives of Black
Caribbeans (McEachern & Kenny, 2002; Waters, 1999). This
article builds upon recent work of Taylor and colleagues
(2007), who found that overall, older Black Caribbeans re-
ported fairly high levels of religious participation similar to
those of older African Americans and higher than those of
older White adults. There were two significant gender findings
in the current analysis. Older Black Caribbean women
attended religious services and engaged in nonorganizational
religious activities more frequently than their male counter-
parts. This finding is consistent with previous research on both
older African Americans (Chatters, Levin, & Taylor, 1992)
and African American adults (Levin, Chatters, & Taylor,
1995). The finding that women demonstrated significantly
higher levels of religiosity is also consistent with research on

older Whites (Blazer & Palmore, 1976) and the American
population in general.
A pattern of significant marital status differences indicated
that married respondents reported higher levels of religious
participation than their nonmarried counterparts for selected
religious measures. Although previous research on marital
status differences in religious participation is somewhat
equivocal (Taylor et al., 2004), the present findings are
consistent with research indicating that marriage is associated
with higher levels of service attendance and other forms of
religious participation among African American adults and
African American elders (Chatters et al., 1992; Chatters &
Taylor, 1994; Chatters, Taylor, & Lincoln, 1999; Ellison &
Sherkat, 1995; Levin et al., 1995). Again, what is noteworthy
here is that marriage was associated with higher levels of
religious service attendance and, in limited instances, non-
organizational religious participation. Previous research has
speculated that the presence of a spouse encourages overall
social integration in religious settings. Religious settings, in
turn, often embody specific value orientations and program-
matic foci (e.g., family-life ministries) that reinforce marriage
and family life and have positive influences on involvement in
religious pursuits (Chatters & Taylor, 2005; Taylor et al., 2004).
We found several significant income effects: Income was
negatively associated with degree of subjective religiosity, as
well as participation in other activities at the place of worship
and participation in nonorganizational religious activities. The
negative direction of these relationships indicates that older
Black Caribbeans with lower incomes reported significantly
higher levels of religious participation than their higher income
counterparts. Interestingly, prior research among older African
Americans has generally failed to find any significant asso-
ciations involving income and religious involvement of any
type (Taylor, 1993; Taylor et al., 2004). The one exception

concerns a negative income effect for strength and intensity of
denominational affiliation and spiritual comfort (Chatters et al.,
1999). We can attribute the emergence of several negative
income relationships in this sample to several possible factors.
First, this set of findings is consistent with a deprivation­
compensation model (Glock, Ringer, & Babbie, 1967), which
suggests that among persons of lower socioeconomic status,
religion serves to compensate for blocked opportunities, limited
access to social institutions, and general social disadvantage. It
may be that religion does serve this specific purpose among
lower status older Black Caribbeans. Second, qualitative
portrayals of immigrant churches emphasize their important
roles in integrating individuals and families within the fabric of
the community (Waters, 1999). Particular characteristics of
immigrant communities (i.e., relative insularity, cultural differ-
ences) may heighten the role of religious institutions and
involvement as a means to procure needed material and social
resources (e.g., social capital). Persons of lower income status
may be particularly inclined to invest in the church and religion
to gain necessary resources. Finally, it is important to recall the
observed income effects for subjective religiosity, participation in
congregational activities, and nonorganizational religious activ-
ities. For lower income older Black Caribbeans, these religious
manifestations are an important means of defining a sense of self
within a religious context and of establishing organizational
involvement as a conduit for social capital. The single education
finding for church attendance (i.e., people with higher education
attend church more often) reflects greater participation in this
more perfunctory component of public religious behavior. Taken
together, the findings indicate that income and education do not
operate similarly in patterning religious involvement. Investi-
gating income and education effects within the entire adult
sample of Black Caribbeans may shed light on the nature and
extent of these status group differences.
Denominational differences in religious participation among
older Black Caribbeans are consistent with research on the
general population. In particular, recent research from the Gallup
Poll on the general American population reported that Baptists
indicated higher levels of service attendance than Catholics
(Newport, 2006), and that Catholics generally had lower levels
of nonorganizational and subjective religious involvement
(Gallup & Lindsay, 1999). Lower levels of participation in con-
gregational activities among Catholics is consistent with research
on congregational climate (Pargament, Silverman, Johnson,
Echemendia, & Snyder, 1983), characterizing Catholic churches
as having lower levels of emotional closeness and sense of
community. The less hierarchical nature of Baptist churches may
afford greater member involvement in congregational activities
(e.g., committees, church boards) and overall member participa-
tion. Alternatively, the findings of lower levels of attendance,
membership, and congregational activities could also indicate
that many older Black Caribbean Catholics may not have found
a church in which they feel comfortable.
There was only one instance in which Baptists had lower
rates of religious involvement as compared to other denomina-
tions. The higher rates of nonorganizational religious participa-
tion among Pentecostals as compared to Baptists are consistent
with general observations. For instance, members of Pentecostal
denominations have high rates of membership in prayer groups
and lay healing groups. In the present circumstance, a main
portion of the denominational difference was due to the fact that
Pentecostals reported that they were more likely than Baptists to
ask someone to pray for them (analysis not shown).
Country of origin was significantly associated with only one
religious participation variable. Older Black Caribbeans who
had emigrated from or traced their heritage to Jamaica
participated in congregational activities more frequently than
did respondents from other English-speaking countries. Older
Black Caribbeans who had emigrated from or traced their
heritage to Spanish-speaking countries and Haiti were no
different from those of Jamaican heritage with respect to
participation in congregational activities.
Immigration status was significantly associated with two of
the religious participation variables: religious service atten-
dance and nonorganizational religious participation. Older
Black Caribbeans who immigrated to the United States less
than 25 years ago and those who immigrated between 26 and
35 years ago both demonstrated higher levels of service atten-
dance and nonorganizational religious activities as compared to
respondents who were had been born in the United States
(persons who immigrated more than 35 years ago were not
significantly different than native-born older Black Caribbeans
in relation to these religious variables). The finding that these
relatively more recent immigrants (0­35 years) demonstrated
higher levels of religious participation than persons who were
born in the United States is consistent with Waters's (1999)
observations concerning the importance of churches and reli-
gious institutions in assisting the transition of Black Caribbean
immigrants into American life. That is to say, the higher levels
of religious service attendance and nonorganizational religious
activities among older Black Caribbeans may be indicative of
an overall pattern of strong connections to religious institutions
and involvement in religious pursuits as a means to structure
social and community life. This type of involvement is parti-
cularly important in aiding the transition of immigrant groups
as they adjust to living in large metropolitan cities.
It is important to recognize that one of the limitations of this
sample is that it excluded individuals who did not speak
English. Non-English-speaking Black Caribbeans (i.e., persons
who speak Spanish, Haitian-French, or Creole dialects) were
not included in the sample and, as a consequence, the study
findings are not generalizeable to these groups. Nonetheless,
the significant advantages of the sample provide an unparalleled
opportunity to begin important explorations into the nature of
religious involvement within this group.
In conclusion, the significant and growing presence of Black
Caribbeans in the United States suggests that this group
deserves more focused attention in the social and behavioral
sciences. Although prior research findings among older African
Americans served as the foundation for this preliminary
investigation, this is not meant to equate the experiences of
these two groups. A tradition of ethnographic research on their
experiences and life histories attests to the unique factors that
continue to shape the development of Black Caribbean
individuals, families, and communities. This study, along
with other recent work (Taylor et al., 2007), is an initial
attempt to develop a more nuanced understanding of religious
involvement among older Black Caribbeans and the role of key
status characteristics (e.g., age, gender, socioeconomic posi-
tion) among members of this group.
