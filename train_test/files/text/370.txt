The decision to develop rotavirus vaccines was predicated on the extensive burden of rotavirus
disease among children worldwide. US reports on nationwide hospitalizations (1979-1992) and
deaths (1968-1991) due to diarrhea and weekly reports of rotavirus infection by 74 laboratories
were reviewed to estimate the burden of rotavirus disease, identify epidemiologic trends, and consider
methods for evaluating an immunization program when a vaccine becomes available. From 1968
to 1985, diarrhea-related deaths among US children <5 years old declined from 1100 to 300/year.
This decline was associated with the disappearance of winter peaks for diarrhea-related deaths
previously associated with rotavirus infection among children 4-23 months old. From 1979 to 1992,
however, hospitalizations for diarrhea averaged 186,000/year and retained their winter peaks, which
have been linked to rotavirus infections. Each year an estimated 54,000-55,000 US children are
hospitalized for diarrhea, but < 40 die with rotavirus. A rotavirus vaccine program will require
improved surveillance, including the timely collection of data from sentinel hospitals, in which a
diagnosis of rotavirus can be established or ruled out for all children hospitalized for diarrhea.
The need for a rotavirus vaccine for children in developing
countries has long been evidenced by the tremendous burden
of rotavirus diarrhea [1, 2]. Many epidemiologic studies have
documented the high prevalence of severe rotavirus diarrhea
among children in developing countries, accounting for, on
average, one-third ofall hospitalizations for diarrhea worldwide
[3] and an estimated 873,000 deaths/year, which is equivalent
to 25% of all diarrheal deaths and 6% of all deaths in children
<5 years old. In 1985, similar information about diarrheal
disease was not available for developed countries, so the Insti-
tute of Medicine, in reviewing new vaccine priorities for devel-
oped countries, concluded that a rotavirus vaccine was not a
priority for the United States [4]. The decision was based on
the results ofa prospective study ofthe incidence ofhospitaliza-
tions for rotavirus diarrhea in a birth cohort of 126 children
followed for 2 years [5] and not on hospital-based studies that
had already documented that one-third of children admitted
for diarrhea have rotavirus infection [6]. While most rotavirus
diarrhea in American children is mild, nearly every child is
infected in the first 2- 3 years of life, and a percentage of these
episodes are severe enough to warrant a visit to a doctor or
hospitalization. By 1985, death, the most severe outcome of
rotavirus infection, had not been documented in a child in the
United States; better data were needed to quantify the more
severe and costly outcomes of rotavirus.

In 1987 in response to this challenge, we began a systematic
study of the epidemiology of rotavirus diarrhea in the United
States. The study was based largely upon mortality and hospi-
talization data that were freely available and in the public do-
main [7, 8]. Data also included some from the Rotavirus Sur-
veillance Network, an initial group of 88 North American
laboratories that were recruited to voluntarily report rotavirus
detections on a weekly basis to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) [9]. Our original goals were to under-
stand the epidemiology of rotavirus in the prevaccine era, to
examine the disease burden of rotavirus diarrhea, and to iden-
tify an indicator(s) of the disease in the epidemiologic data
that were available. For hospitalizations and deaths, the task
was a challenge, because no code from the ninth revision of
the International Classification of Diseases (lCD-9) existed for
rotavirus; we had to work with a collection of nonspecific
codes for diarrhea (e.g., diarrhea, presumed noninfectious) and
identify epidemiologic patterns that would specifically define
rotavirus disease. Besides providing retrospective information
on diarrheal hospitalizations and deaths in the United States,
we felt that this survey would help define methods to assess
the disease burden of rotavirus in other countries and to gain
experience with the feasibility ofdifferent surveillance methods
to monitor the impact of a rotavirus vaccine program when
such a program was implemented.
This paper reviews studies done primarily by the CDC that
laid the groundwork for our appreciation that rotavirus diarrhea
is an important cause of disease leading to hospitalization of
children in the United States. As a result of these studies and
others, we now have national measures of both morbidity and
mortality to estimate the disease burden of rotavirus diarrhea.
These data have been used to calculate the cost-effectiveness
S6 Glass et al. JID 1996; 174 (Suppl 1)
of a rotavirus vaccine program, identify unusual epidemiologic
features of rotavirus, such as the west-to-east dissemination
pattern of the disease, and document that the peak of winter
deaths in the United States attributed to rotavirus has declined
in recent years. From these activities, we have further identified
areas where improved surveillance could provide timely data
to assess the impact of an intervention program with vaccines.
Methods and Findings
Background. To estimate the disease burden of rotavirus
diarrhea, we quantified all clinically severe diarrheal events
(i.e., deaths, hospitalizations, and doctor visits) and tried to
identify, on the basis of our understanding of the epidemiology
of the disease, those events that might be due to rotavirus. We
turned to two national sources of data available from the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, CDC), the multiple
cause-of-death data [10] and the National Hospital Discharge
Survey (NHDS) data [11], and to data on the laboratory surveil-
lance of rotavirus that is linked with the National Enteric and
Respiratory Surveillance System [12]. Since no codes in the
ICD-9 or ICD-9-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) were
available for rotavirus diarrhea before 1993, we had to use a
collection of codes for diarrhea, even though we knew that
>90% ofdiarrheal events, even those leading to hospitalization
or death, are coded without an etiologic diagnosis [13, 14].
For analysis of diarrhea mortality, we included reports of
deaths that had diarrhea coded anywhere on the NCHS death
record. For analysis of hospitalizations, we included records in
which codes for diarrhea were listed in the first three positions
on the discharge record. Previous experience had shown us
that diarrhea would be listed as the first code on the record for
73% of the hospitalizations and as the third code for 95% [15].
Use of records with diarrhea recorded only as the first cause of
hospitalization seemed restrictive, since dehydration, a related
diagnosis, was often reported as the first cause of hospitaliza-
tion, and limiting diarrheal diagnosis to the top three positions
would exclude only 5% of key events that might be secondary
to the true cause of hospitalization.
NHDS data. Information on hospital discharges has proven
to be the most robust, sensitive, and important data available
to monitor rotavirus activity in the United States. Events re-
ported in these discharge reports are costly (>$1000/day) and
numerous, and our experience indicates that they not only re-
flect the level of rotavirus activity but reveal epidemiologic
trends that were previously unrecognized [7]. Earlier etiologic
studies ofchildren hospitalized for diarrhea in the United States
suggested that hospital discharge would be a strong predictor
of rotavirus activity: rotavirus-related diarrhea was the most
common cause of hospitalization for diarrhea among children
<5 years (~30%), rotavirus activity was highly seasonal (win-
ter months), and rotavirus diarrhea was limited to children
between 3 and 35 months of age [6, 16-18].
The first rotavirus studies by Ho et al. [7, 8] used NHDS
data from 1979-1984 with a variety of ICD-9-CM codes for
diarrhea, most of which were nonspecific, to look for national
trends in diarrheal hospitalizations by age, time, and geographic
region that might reflect rotavirus activity. The NHDS data
represent a systematic sample of patient discharges obtained
from hospitalized short-stay non-federal general and specialty
hospitals in the United States [18a]. To look more carefully at
age, geographic, and seasonal trends that required a larger data
set, Ho and colleagues [8] examined hospital discharge data
from the McDonnell-Douglas Automated Data Information
Systems, which represented a 16% nonsystematic sample of
all hospitalizations in the United States [7]. Results from the
two surveys were comparable, and the larger data set only
helped to decrease the confidence limits of the smaller data
set: ~21O,000 children 1-59 months of age were hospitalized
each year for diarrhea, representing ~9.5% of all hospitaliza-
tions among children of this age group. These hospitalizations
peaked from November through April, and these peaks ofactiv-
ity were primarily among children 3-35 months of age. More-
over, the peak ofthis activity began in the Southwest in Novem-
ber and moved across the United States, ending in the Northeast
in March and April. A 5-year national survey of the detection
of rotavirus by 88 US laboratories was done by LeBaron et al.
[9]. This study confirmed that the peak of rotavirus detections
followed the same geographic and temporal patterns as hospi-
talizations and deaths for diarrhea and suggested that the winter
seasonal peaks of hospitalizations for diarrhea were due to
rotavirus.
Since the original rotavirus study (Ho et al. [7]) ended with
data from 1984, Jin et a1. [19] repeated and updated the study
with data from 1979 to 1992, the last year for which hospital
discharge data were available, to see if hospitalizationfor diarrhea,
particularly in the winter, remains a problem (figure lA). After
reviewing information on 16,049 hospitalizations, representing a
weighted total of 2.6 million discharges (i.e., annual average of
186,000 hospitalizations for diarrhea/year), their findings were
comparable to those of Ho et al. [7] and others. While the annual
number of diarrheal hospitalizations decreased by 13% over time,
the winter seasonal peaks remained constant, and the geographic
and temporal appearance of these peaks-first in the Southwest
and later in the Northeast-was unchanged. Jin et a1. [19] found
that the winter peak for diarrheal diseases coded as "viral" (19%
ofthe total and many ofwhich are presumed to be due to rotavirus)
was mimicked by the larger number of diarrheal diseases that
were presumed to be noninfections (71% of the total) and by the
total group of diarrheal episodes, suggesting that these groups
shared a common etiology. Only the small number (5%) of diar-
rheal episodes caused by bacteria had a different seasonal pattern.
In the absence of hard data on laboratory-confirmed cases of
rotavirus diarrhea, we developed two distinct and independent
methods to estimate the proportion of hospitalizations that
might be attributable to rotavirus [19, 21]. The first method,

the residual estimate, defined rotavirus-related hospitalizations
as the excess number of hospitalizations in winter versus sum-
mer season. Summer was defined as the 6-month period without
rotavirus activity (May-October); winter included the months
November-April. Since the summer baseline would include
bacterial diarrheas not present in the winter, we felt this esti-
mate would be conservative, possibly underestimating the per-
centage of the excess peak due to rotavirus. The excess was
greatest during the month ofJanuary and was least in November
and April, representing the geographic hospitalization peaks in
the Southwest and the Northeast, respectively.
The second method, rate standardization estimate, was
derived by multiplying the month-specific rate of rotavirus
detection among children hospitalized for diarrhea over an
8-year period in Washington, DC, by the monthly rates of
diarrheal hospitalization in the United States over the 14-
year period taken from the discharge survey [6, 19]. While
other hospital-based surveillance studies have been done,
this study is the largest, and the data are reported by month,
allowing proper standardization of rates. Furthermore,
these rates do not differ greatly from those of other smaller
hospital-based studies. When these two estimates were
compared, they yielded time curves that were synchronous
and numeric predictions of the same magnitude-about
55,000 hospitalizations/year.
National mortality data. Since no child in the United States
had ever been reported to have died with a diagnosis of rotavi-
rus diarrhea, many pediatricians have felt that it is never severe
or fatal. A review ofnational mortality data, initially for 1972-
1983 and more recently for 1968- 1991, has provided cogent
but indirect evidence that rotavirus has been a cause of death
in American children (figure 1B) [8,20]. The NCHS's multiple
cause-of-death data were examined to extract diarrheal deaths
with a variety of ICD codes from the adapted ICD-8 (1968-
1978) and ICD-9 (1979-1991) [13,22]. Most of the deaths
(>90%) had no etiologic diagnosis, and since no ICD code
was available for rotavirus during this study period, none of
the deaths could be attributed directly to rotavirus.
Nonetheless, the analysis of data for 14,137 deaths due to
diarrhea that occurred from 1968 through 1991 provided some
insight into the role that rotavirus diarrhea may playas a cause
of death in American children [20]. In the United States, the
number of deaths due to diarrhea has declined continuously
from ,...., 1100 deaths/year in 1968 to ,....,300/year for each year
from 1985 to 1991. These deaths had a distinct winter seasonal
peak that was most marked among children 3- 24 months old,
epidemiologic characteristics similar to those observed for chil-
dren hospitalized for diarrhea. An unexpected finding of this
study was that this peak showed the same geographic and
temporal trend as hospitalizations and laboratory detections of
rotavirus beginning in the Southwest in November and ending
in the Northeast in March-April. Most (78%) of these deaths
were in children < 1 year old. Diarrhea appeared to be the
likely cause of death, since other diagnoses were most often
problems ofelectrolyte imbalance, dehydration, and other com-
plications of diarrhea.
The decline in deaths from 1968 to 1985 was associated
with a marked dampening of the winter peaks for diarrheal
disease. Since 1985, an excess of winter deaths associated with
diarrhea is still evident in children 3- 23 months old, but it is
much less prominent than before. Ho et al. [8] originally attrib-
uted the excess of winter versus summer deaths due to diarrhea
to rotavirus and determined they represented 75- 125 deaths/
year [8]. According to data for the most recent years for which
data on deaths due to diarrhea are available, 1985-1991, these
deaths now number about 20/year [20].
We hypothesized that this decline in winter deaths attribut-
able to rotavirus could be due either to a decrease in the overall
incidence ofsevere diarrhea in winter or to improvements in the
case management of diarrhea or access to care. The unchanged
number of winter hospitalizations indicates that the decline in
deaths must be due to other factors, such as improved case
management or access to care.
National laboratory surveillance. All data described so far
have been independent of a specific diagnosis of rotavirus. The
observation that the peak of winter hospitalizations and deaths
moved from the Southwest in November toward the Northeast in
March-April led us to establish the Rotavirus SurveillanceActiv-
ity to monitor this pattern retrospectively for 1985-1989 and
prospectively to the present [9, 12, 23]. The 5-year retrospective
survey confirmed for the first time the unusual geographic and
temporal trends of rotavirus detections, which represent unique
epidemiologic indicators for the disease. The fact that this pattern
occurs in a repeated fashion undermines simple explanations that
temperature or humidity caused the seasonal peaks of rotavirus.
The alternativehypothesis, that individual strains were migrating,
was also dismissed when Gouvea et al. [24] found multiple strains
emerging in different parts ofthe United Statesin the same season
and when strains from the same city in different seasons were
often similar,suggesting a common local reservoir. Similar obser-
vations were made by Matson et al. [25].
National reporting of rotavirus detections from 74 labora-
tories in the United States has been ongoing since the original
survey by LeBaron et al. [9]. The national surveillance has
identified summer peaks ofrotavirus activity that, when investi-
gated, were found to be due to poor laboratory practices (i.e.,
>6 different technicians doing the test) and to the use of a
commercial test that was sold without proper controls [23].
While reporting is weekly and on a voluntary basis, much
information that would be important for evaluating an interven-
tion program is not now collected. For instance, the laboratories
do not record the patient's age or underlying illness or whether
patients were hospitalized or seen as outpatients or whether
the infection was acquired in the community or in the hospital.
In addition, specimens are not submitted, so there can be no
assessment of rotavirus strains currently in circulation.

Estimates ofdisease burden. A major goal of these epide-
miologic studies has been to quantify the role played by rotavi-
rus as a cause of diarrhea among children in the United States.
Early longitudinal studies and recent placebo-controlled field
trials have indicated that if surveillance is conducted actively
with two or more home visits per week, the incidence ofrotavi-
rus diarrhea may reach 0.30 episodes/childlyear during the first
2 years of life, with a cumulative incidence approaching 0.80
episodes in a child reaching age 5 [5, 26-28]. Doctor visits
are less frequent (,...., 1/8 children) by age 5, but the national
robust and has the greatest margin of error [29]. On the basis
of NCHS hospitalization data for all diagnoses of diarrhea, we
estimate that 1 in 25 children will be hospitalized for diarrhea
during the first 5 years of life (as determined by the estimate
of 186,000 hospitalizations for diarrhea in children 1-59
months old in a birth cohort of 4 million children followed for
5 years). About 1 in 73 infants will be hospitalized for rotavirus
diarrhea, as determined using our estimate of 55,000 hospital-
izations. The 20 deaths per year (1 per 200,000 live births)
probably represent a subgroup of children with underlying ill-
nesses or conditions, such as prematurity [20].
These data on the national disease burden of rotavirus diar-
rhea must be placed in context of the other estimates that have
been made (table 1). First, the Institute of Medicine in 1985
estimated the number ofhospitalizations for rotavirus at 23,000
per year by extrapolating data from a longitudinal study of 126
children to the total population of children in the United States
[4]. Second, Ho et al. [7] estimated 65,000-70,000 hospitaliza-
tions/year by using the approach described in this paper with
hospital discharge data from 1979-1985. Third, Matson et al.
[17] used data for rotavirus hospitalizations at Texas Children's
Hospital to prepare broader estimates of 110,000 hospitaliza-
tions/year, one-third of which were associated with nosocomial
infections. Last, Smith et al. [30] estimated 104,000 rotavirus-
related hospitalizations/year by updating the figures of Ho et
al. with newer information on the growth of the birth cohort
over the intervening decade. The current figure is most similar
to that of Ho et aI., and the decrease in the total number of
hospitalizations reflects a 13% decline in the incidence of all
hospitalizations for diarrhea over the past decade.
Surveillance of laboratory strains. A number of surveys
have been done to examine rotavirus strains collected in the
United States [24, 25, 31, 32]. Rotavirus strains are character-
ized by the outer capsid proteins that are important for virus
neutralization: glycoprotein (G protein) encoded by gene seg-
ment 7, 8, or 9 and the protease-cleaved protein (P protein)
encoded by gene segment 4. The surveys indicate that only 4
strains are commonly circulating-P[8], Gl, P[4], G2, P[8],
G3, and P[R], <T4-although some unusual strains have been
documented on rare occasions and confirmed when both G and
P typing have been done [31, 33, 34]. Strains appear to have
a local reservoir, since the same strains are found from year
to year in the same location. Rotavirus infects older children
and adults routinely, and one might expect periodic outbreaks
with illness in older children or adults if strains with major
antigenic differences were to emerge. Clearly, surveillance of
laboratory strains will have to continue, with specific emphasis
on the identification of new circulating strains and examination
of their prevalence in the population.
Discussion
In the prevaccine era, the purpose of surveillance has been
limited to describing trends in rotavirus activity and obtaining
better estimates of the burden of rotavirus disease. Using na-
tional data for hospitalizations and deaths and additional infor-
mation from laboratory surveillance, we have been able to infer
that the winter peaks ofhospitalizations for diarrhea and deaths
in children 3- 23 months of age that appear first in the South-
west in November and move to the Northeast by March- April
are attributable to rotavirus. This finding has permitted us to
estimate the magnitude ofthe disease burden ofrotavirus hospi-
talizations (55,000/year) and deaths (20-40/year) in the United
States and assess the annual cost of this burden (> 1 billion
dollars) while identifying unusual seasonal and geographic pat-
terns that represent a unique epidemiologic indicator of this
disease. When we first examined diarrhea mortality in Ameri-
S10 Glass et at. lID 1996; 174 (Suppl 1)
can children through the year 1983, we were surprised to find
hundreds of deaths were occurring each year and that they had
a seasonal and geographic pattern consistent with rotavirus
disease. Since 1985, the total number of deaths due to diarrhea
has leveled off at --300/year, and the annual winter peak of
excess deaths in children 3- 23 months of age attributable to
rotavirus has nearly disappeared. The observation that these
winter deaths have decreased while hospitalizations have con-
tinued (i.e., an improved death-to-hospitalization ratio) is con-
sistent with the hypothesis that these improvements are due
either to better access to care or improved treatment ofchildren
with severe rotavirus diarrhea. Ofnote, this suspected improve-
ment in rotavirus mortality does not markedly alter the cost-
effectiveness results since most of the medical costs in the
analysis are due to hospitalizations [30]. The number of hospi-
talizations has declined only slightly over the past 14 years,
and the winter seasonal peak in children 3-35 months of age
remains a distinguishing feature.
A key epidemiologic feature ofrotavirus disease, which was
identified in our initial analyses of deaths and hospitalizations
and later confirmed in the surveillance of laboratory detection
of rotavirus, is the movement of the rotavirus season in time
and place, starting in the Southwest in November and moving
to the Northeast in March- April. This movement indicates that
neither temperature nor humidity alone can explain the trend.
Laboratory studies suggest that each community may have its
own local reservoir of strains, since there is not a single epi-
demic strain, and we have no credible hypothesis to explain
this unique trend.
Surveillance of laboratory detections of rotavirus infections
has provided information on rotavirus activity in the United
States that is inexpensive (voluntary reporting) and timely
(weekly reporting); however, it has not provided additional
information that could be of considerable epidemiologic use-
fulness (e.g., a breakdown of infections by patient age or status
[inpatient vs. outpatient] or whether the infection was commu-
nity- or nosocomially acquired). As we move closer to consid-
ering implementation of a rotavirus vaccine program, sentinel
surveillance will have to be established using indicator hospi-
tals, laboratory-confirmed illness, and patients who are specifi-
cally hospitalized for diarrhea, preferably at centers with a
defined population base. While laboratories are willing to vol-
untarily report detections ofrotavirus infections, the large-scale
collection and handling of rotavirus specimens for study of
strain variation or the emergence of unusual serotypes will
require a larger infusion of resources. In the interim, smaller
surveys have confirmed that the 4 main serotypes found in
repeated studies globally are also predominant in the United
States.
The determination ofdisease burden is fraught with potential
bias due to assumptions in estimating prevalence rates for ro-
tavirus disease. Weare confident that our estimates of the
number of hospitalizations due to rotavirus infections are rea-
sonable: They were determined by two completely different
and independent approaches, yet the estimates are nearly identi-
cal. They are midway between the initial low estimates of the
Institute of Medicine [4] and the highest estimates of Matson
et al. [17] and within 15% of similar estimates we derived 8
years ago [21], and they are based on true hospitalization fig-
ures rather than estimates using hospitalization rates adjusted
for the increasing population of children <5 years old [30].
They represent our best estimate made with an absence of data
on hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed rotavirus diarrhea
rather than a precise determination. Better data from longitudi-
nal studies would require that large cohorts of children
(> 10,000) be followed because the frequency of hospitaliza-
tions is relatively low (estimated at 1/73 children). Since a new
ICD code for rotavirus diarrhea was designated in 1993 and
will be included in the 10th revision of the lCD, it is likely
that in the near future we may begin having direct reports of
both hospitalizations and deaths due to rotavirus diarrhea.
The approach to surveillance that uses national or sentinel
data on hospital discharges and deaths and has identified sea-
sonal and age trends for diarrheal illnesses, provided estimates
of rotavirus prevalence, and proved to be a simple and eco-
nomic method to address the epidemiology and assess the dis-
ease burden of rotavirus diarrhea in the prevaccine era. The
method should be applicable in other countries that might con-
sider the use of a rotavirus vaccine and could provide informa-
tion critical to making national decisions and establishing na-
tional priorities [35]. At the same time, NHDSs provide data
with a 3-year delay and without information on 1aboratory-
confirmed cases. In view of the impending licensure of vac-
cines, a different approach to surveillance will be required that
will permit evaluation of the effectiveness of an immunization
program. This will require more intense surveillance in which
sentinel hospitals provide in-depth information on patients hos-
pitalized for rotavirus diarrhea confirmed by laboratory detec-
tion. Such sentinel hospital surveillance in larger-scale catch-
ment trials and on a regional or national basis will be critical
to monitor a decline in winter hospitalizations for diarrhea,
which would be anticipated after the introduction ofa rotavirus
vaccine program. At the same time, increased surveillance of
strains will be essential to determine if some new serotypes
escape vaccination and become predominant.
