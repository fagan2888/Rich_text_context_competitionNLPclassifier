Objective. We aim to investigate whether centenarians are significantly more resilient than younger elders and whether resilience
significantly contributes to exceptional longevity. Data. We use a unique dataset from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity
Survey with the largest sample to date of centenarians, nonagenarians, octogenarians, and a compatible group of young old
aged 65­79. Methods and Results. Logistic regressions based on the cross-sectional sample show that after controlling for various
confounders, including physical health and cognitive status, centenarians are significantly more resilient than any other old-age
group. Logistic regression analyses based on the longitudinal data show that nonagenarians aged 94­98 with better resilience have
a 43.1% higher likelihood of becoming a centenarian compared to nonagenarians with lower resilience. Conclusions. Resilience
significantly contributes to longevity at all ages, and it becomes even more profound at very advanced ages. These findings indicate
that policies and programs to promote resilience would have long-term and positive effects on the well-being and longevity for
senior citizens and their families.
1. Introduction
Extant literature has highlighted the particular relevance
of centenarians for healthy longevity research, given that
they have outlived most of their cohort peers by several
decades, and they represent a highly selected group. For
example, according to recent life-table data, the probability
of surviving from age 50 to age 100 is about 0.38% and 1.05%
for Chinese men and women, respectively, which is slightly
less than one-fifth of that in the U.S. As shown by Flachsbart
[1], only about 4.8% of 90-year-olds and 16.0% of 95-year-
olds in Germany are likely to reach the age of 100. A study
by Yi and Vaupel [2] showed that about 3.4% of 90-year-olds
and 14.9% of 95-year-olds in China are likely to survive to the
age of 100. These figures indicate that centenarians are highly
selected long-lived individuals, even among those who have
reached 90­95 years old. A focus on extreme cases is often
a good way to gain research leverage at reasonable expense;
thus, investigating centenarians (some of whom are healthy
and demonstrate successful aging) and comparing them with
other younger age groups is an efficient way to learn what
factors may contribute to healthy longevity.
Resilience, a psychological construct, has been defined
differently in extant literatures. In this paper, we adopt
the simplified and straightforward definition specified by
Lamond et al. [3]; namely, resilience connotes the ability to
adapt positively to adversity. Previous studies have demon-
strated that resilience is generally positively correlated with
cognitive function, physical health and self-reported health
among the elderly [4­6], as well as with self-rated successful
aging [3] in developed countries. Poon [7] discovered that
the common characteristics of the Georgia centenarians
sample are optimism and flexibility, which are documented
to be associated with resilience [8]. Based on a Swedish
sample, Nygren [9] found that mean resilience scores are
higher in their oldest old sample (over age 85) compared
to the scores of the younger adults. Selim [10] discovered
that U.S. centenarian veterans are psychologically resilient
despite their poor physical health. Jopp and Rott [11] also
demonstrated that psychological resilience is well preserved

Centenarian Study.
However, there are three major limitations in the pre-
vious research on centenarians and resilience. First, most
of the prior studies were based on small samples with
limited numbers of centenarians and nonagenarians, which
restricted estimation efficiency [11, 12]. After a careful lit-
erature search, we have discovered that among all published
studies concerning the characteristics and effects of resilience
among centenarians with a comparison to other age groups,
the largest sample was 272 Japanese centenarians by Yukie et
al. [13].
Second, though some studies compared resilience bet-
ween centenarians and young-old groups [7, 8, 10, 11], no
prior research (to our knowledge) has explored whether
resilience contributes to exceptional longevity at very adva-
nced ages 95+.
Third, almost all previously published studies in this
field dealt with developed countries; we found very few
studies on centenarians and resilience from developing
countries [2, 14, 15]. Shen and Zeng [15] reported on the
positive association between resilience and survival among
the Chinese elderly aged 65+, but they did not investigate
whether the association still held at extremely advanced
ages, for example, age 95 and older. As Ju and Jones [16]
noted, in high-mortality populations, the oldest old are
those highly selected individuals who have survived dangers
when being born, risks in infancy and childhood, and
hunger, sickness, and accidents at middle- and young-old
ages. As evidence of the high-mortality selection in China,
there were about five centenarians per million in China
in the 1990s, compared with 50 per million in Western
Europe [17]. Another important factor is that facilities to
assist oldest old persons in their daily life are less likely
to be available in developing countries than in industrial
countries. This may force the oldest old in developing
countries to perform daily activities by themselves, and
the frequent exercise may enable them to maintain their
physical capacities for a longer time than their counterparts
in developed countries. These factors may help to explain
why the elderly in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand have, in some comparative studies,
found to be more active than the elderly in developed
countries [16, 18]. Similarly, the functional capacity of
centenarians in the three cities of Beijing, Hangzhou, and
Chengdu in China has also been reported to be significantly
better than that of Danish centenarians [19]. Thus, research
on centenarians from developing countries including China,
where the oldest old individuals are highly selected from poor
early-life conditions and severe adversities, may be useful for
identifying what factors may affect exceptional longevity.
Based on the cross-sectional data from 2008-09 wave
of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey
(CLHLS) consisting of 16,566 elderly aged 65+ with 3,413
centenarians and 4,596 nonagenarians, as well as the follow-
up data from the exceptionally long-lived individuals in
the CLHLS 2002, 2005, and 2008-2009 waves, we test the
following hypotheses.
H1 after controlling for various potential confounders
including physical health and cognitive status, cen-
tenarians are significantly more resilient than the
younger elderly.
H2 better resilience significantly contributes to excep-
tional longevity at very advanced ages.
2. Data, Measurements, and Methods
2.1. Data Source. The datasets used in this paper are from
the CLHLS, which has been conducted in 1998, 2000, 2002,
2005, and 2008-2009 in a randomly selected half of the
counties/cities in 22 Chinese provinces, covering 85% of the
total population in China [20]. The 1998 baseline and the
2000 followup surveys interviewed the oldest old aged 80 and
above only; since the 2002 wave, younger-old respondents
aged 65­79 were also included in the sample. Careful and
systematic evaluations (such as reliability coefficients and
factor analysis, etc.) have shown that the data quality of the
CLHLS surveys is reasonably good [21].
Cross-sectional data from the newest CLHLS wave
conducted in 2008-2009, with a total sample size of 16,566
elderly aged 65 and above including 3,413 centenarians and
4,596 nonagenarians, is used to test hypothesis H1. Table 1
presents the sample distribution of the CLHLS 2008-2009
wave by urban-rural residence, age groups, and gender.
Comparative analysis on the resilience scores between
centenarians and the other age groups may only reveal
the "de facto" differences in resilience scores between the
centenarians and the younger elders. Such cross-sectional
analysis may not be suitable to examine the impact of
resilience on attaining exceptional longevity as proposed by
hypothesis H2. Thus, we conduct another set of multivariate
Current Gerontology and Geriatrics Research 3
analyses based on the follow-up data including those aged
94­97 in the 2002 survey and those aged 97-98 in the 2005
survey (we include the nonagenarians who were interviewed
in the 2002 and 2005 waves rather than the 1998 baseline
and 2000 wave of CLHLS, because two of the seven resilience
questions were not asked in the 1998 baseline and the 2000
wave). The rationale for these analyses is that we wish
to investigate whether resilience significantly contributes
to surviving to 100 years old before or in the 2008-2009
interview among the nonagenarians who are the potential
candidates and need to survive for at least two more years
to reach age 100. The eligible sample consists of 585 men
(38.3%) and 943 women (61.7%), all of whom were either
interviewed at age 94­97 in 2002 or interviewed at age 97-
98 in 2005. Among them, 1,049 (68.7%) died at ages <100
(failed to become a centenarian) and 479 (31.3%) survived
to age 100 before or in the 2008-2009 survey (successful in
becoming a centenarian).
2.2. Measurements
2.2.1. Variables of Interest
Resilience. As the datasets used in this paper are derived
from the CLHLS which is a typical demographic study on
determinants of healthy longevity rather than a detailed
psychological investigation, we use a simplified resilience
score (abbreviated as SRS hereafter) emphasizing coping
and adjustment among the elderly. Our SRS is theoretically
guided by the general framework of, but different from,
the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) [22]. The
SRS is based on the available data collected through seven
questions related to resilience in the CLHLS (See Table 2). In
general, the seven items reflect personal tenacity, optimism,
coping with negative mood, secure relationship, and self-
control, which are deemed as important factors of resilience
[22]. These items have their own counterparts in CD-RISC
which deliver similar meanings. For example, item 1 of SRS
corresponds to the item "Think of self as strong person" in
CD-RISC; item 2 corresponds to the item "See the humorous
side of things"; items 3 and 4 correspond to the item "Can
handle unpleasant feelings". In fact, some previous studies
have also proposed resilience scales with very limited number
of items focusing on one or two specific aspects of resilience.
For example, Smith [23] proposed a Brief Resilience Scale
(BRS), which included 6 items and focused on the ability
to bounce back or recover from stress. Sinclair and Wallston
[24] constructed a Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) with
4 items, emphasizing on the resilient coping process.
Items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 of SRS in the CLHLS carry a
five-point (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) range of the responses (see
Table 2). We dichotomize the scores of items 5 and 6, because
the rather detailed multiple choices of the answers for these
two items only allow us to do so. With such scores which
contain the maximum information, we can obtain from the
survey the total SRS ranges from 0 to 22, with higher scores
reflecting greater resilience.
The internal consistency of SRS measured by Cronbach's
alpha coefficient is 0.69, indicating its reliability is reason-

ably adequate [25]. Principle component analysis generates
three factors with eigenvalues >1, explaining 78.5% of the
total variance. These basic indicators of the psychometric
properties show that the SRS based on the CLHLS data are
reasonably acceptable.
If the respondents are able to answer the questions 5
and 6 regarding social support, they do so; otherwise, proxy
responses are allowed because spouses and close relatives
typically know respondents' sources of social support (proxy
responses are widely used in interviews with elderly [26].
The proportions of proxy answers for question 5 and 6 in
the CLHLS are 27.17% and 26.97%, respectively. We also
conducted regression analyses excluding the cases with proxy
responses, and found very similar results between excluding
and including the proxy responses). Questions concerning
resilience items 1­4 and item 7 (see Table 2) relate to the self-
feelings of the elderly and may not be judged accurately by
others; thus, they are required to be answered by the elderly
respondent him/herself in the survey. As a result, 17.1% of
the respondents are unable to answer these questions due
to poor cognitive ability. Simply, excluding these cases with
the missing values might lead to sampling bias. Thus, we
conduct multiple imputations for the missing values of these
five resilience items based on the respondents' age, gender,
race, education, physical health measured by Activities of
Daily Living (ADL), and cognitive status measured by Mini
Mental State Examination (MMSE) [27].
2.2.2. Potential Confounding Factors
Age Group. We categorize the continuous age variable into 4
groups: ages 65­79 (reference), ages 80­89, ages 90­99, and
ages 100.
4 Current Gerontology and Geriatrics Research
Demographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics. We include
gender (male or female), race (Han ethnicity or minority),
residential place (urban or rural), marital status (currently
married or unmarried including widowed, divorced, and
never married), education (literate or illiterate), and pension
status (with or without pension) as demographic and
socioeconomic controls. Each control variable is measured
as a dummy variable.
Health Status. Health status is measured by ADL and MMSE,
which are based on international standards and adapted
to the Chinese culture and social context with carefully
conducted pilot study tests. More specifically, ADL is based
on Katz's ADL index, representing the physical health of
the elderly [28]. If a person needs help to perform any of
the six daily tasks of bathing, dressing, indoor transferring,
going to the toilet and cleaning oneself afterwards, eating,
and continence, he/she is considered to be ADL dependent;
otherwise, he/she is regarded as ADL independent. MMSE
has been widely used for assessing cognitive mental status
both in clinical practice and in research [29, 30]. The MMSE
questionnaire includes 24 items with a total possible score
of 30. We define those who have a score of less than 24 as
cognitively impaired [30].
Resilience might have an indirect impact on survival
through health status of the elderly. Thus, we control
for health status in the models so that we can examine
whether resilience has a direct impact on survival among
the elderly. A similar design has been used in previous
studies. For example, to examine the effect of religious
attendance on mortality, Hill et al. [31] first ran the
regression without controlling for health status and then
included ADL, cognitive function, and other health measures
in the model to see whether the effect of religious attendance
on survival persisted and whether part of the effect of
religious attendance was mediated through health status.
2.3. Methods. In the empirical analyses, the original SRS
variable (ranging from score 0 to 22) is dichotomized into
two categories according to the mean of resilience scores:
higher resilience (with a resilience score 16) and lower
resilience (with a resilience score <16). We apply logistic
regression based on the cross-sectional data from the CLHLS
2008-2009 wave to test hypothesis H1 concerning whether
centenarians are more resilient than any other age group. The
independent variables of main interest are three age group
dummy variables: centenarians, nonagenarians, and octo-
genarians, with age group 65­79 as the reference category.
Potentially confounding variables including demographic
and socioeconomic characteristics and health status are
outlined above.
To test hypothesis H2"Better resilience significantly con-
tributes to exceptional longevity at very advanced ages,"
we apply the multivariate logistic regression model based
on the longitudinal data. The dependent variable of the
logistic regression is whether the nonagenarian aged 94­
97 in 2002 or aged 97­98 in 2005 survived to age 100
or died at age <100 before the CLHLS 2008-2009 survey.

The key independent variable is whether the elderly enjoy
higher resilience (with an SRS 16) or lower resilience (with
an SRS <16). We control for age, gender, race, residence,
marital status, and pension status as well as physical health
and cognitive status measured by ADL and MMSE. We also
adjust for the year of the interview and for dummy variables
indicating province.
3. Results
3.1. Descriptive Analysis. As shown by the descriptive statis-
tics based on the cross-sectional data presented in Table 3,
the mean SRS are the highest for the young-old aged 65­79
without controlling for other covariates, while there are very
little differences among the octogenarians, nonagenarians,
and centenarians. Men have better SRS than women. A
much larger proportion of the older men are literate and
enjoy pension compared to the older women, due to the
social background of gender inequality in China in the past.
Additionally, men are more advantaged in ADL and MMSE
than women in each of the age groups.
Figure 1 depicts the weighted average SRS by 5-year
age groups, gender, and urban-rural residence. Elderly men
are always more resilient than their female counterparts in
each of the age groups depicted in the figure. In general,
the average SRS in urban and rural among the young old
aged 65­69 is the highest and then decline as age increases.
However, the SRS remains relatively stable after age 85. The
Chinese elderly residing in urban area have higher resilience
scores than their rural counterparts (see Figure 1).
3.2. Centenarians Are Significantly More Resilient than Any
Other Elderly Adults, After Controlling for Various Con-
founders Including Health. Table 3 and Figure 1 have shown
that the average SRS of centenarians is lower than that of
the younger respondents aged below 85 (except the average
SRS of the female rural centenarians which is slightly higher
than that of female rural elderly aged 80­84). Table 4 presents
estimates of the odds ratios regarding the associations of
age-group dummy variables with better resilience among

Note: the mean SRS among the elderly aged 65­79, 80­89, and 90­99, presented in this table and in Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are weighted averages, using the
2000 census rural-urban-sex-age distributions and the corresponding CLHLS 2008-2009 sample distributions to compute the weights. The mean resilience
scores of the centenarians are unweighted as the CLHLS study tried to interview all of the centenarians in the sampled areas.
the elderly population. The results of model 1 indicate that
without adjusting for any confounders, the likelihoods of
enjoying better resilience for the octogenarians, nonagenari-
ans, and centenarians are 40.3%, 55.7%, and 69.7% (P < .01)
lower than that for the young old aged 65­79. After adding
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics into model
2, the odds ratios for the octogenarians, nonagenarians, and
centenarians (as compared to the young old aged 65­79)
increase substantially, but are still significantly less than 1.0,
indicating that the age difference is largely reduced with
the addition of these controls. Model 3 further adjusts for
physical health and cognitive mental status measured by ADL
and MMSE; once these health variables are controlled for,
centenarians are in fact, significantly more resilient than the
young old by a margin of 26.1% (P < .01), nonagenarians
also marginally enjoy better resilience than the young old by
a margin of 10.9% (P < .1), while there is no significant
difference in resilience between octogenarians and the young
old (we also ran ordinary least square regressions using the
original SRS scores (ranging from 0 to 22) as the continuous
dependent variable, and the results (data not shown due
to space limitations) support the same conclusion as the
logistic regressions do shown in Table 4). These results
show that centenarians are a highly selected and special
subpopulation with the best resilience after controlling for
various confounders including health.
We further estimate the odds ratios separately for men
and women in Model 4 and Model 5. We find that after
adjusting for all potential confounders including ADL and
MMSE, male and female centenarians are significantly
more resilient than the young old, and the difference is
substantially larger among men than among women.
The age pattern of resilience presented in Table 4 is, in
general, similar to the findings from the study by Nygren and
colleagues [9] on a Swedish oldest old sample aged 85 and
older and the research by Lamond and colleagues [3] on the
American elderly aged 65 and older, though both of these two
studies did not provide explicit estimates for centenarians.
We discover that centenarians' average SRS without adjusting
for confounders is lower than that of the young-old due to
their poorer objective health. After the health status variables
are controlled for, the centenarians are much more resilient
than the young old.
Regarding the confounding variables, we find that after
adjusting for various other confounders, men are signifi-
cantly more resilient than women; the elderly residing in
urban areas, having at least one year of schooling, and
enjoying pension benefits have significantly better resilience.
Marriage has a very strong positive impact on resilience.
Better physical health and cognitive status significantly
improve resilience (see Table 4).
3.3. Better Resilience Significantly Contributes to Exceptional
Longevity at Very Advanced Ages. As shown in Table 5, the
likelihood of surviving to age 100 for the elderly aged 94­
97 in 2002 or aged 97-98 in 2005 with higher resilience
score was 74.6% (P < .01) higher than the likelihood of
their counterparts with lower resilience scores in Model 1
with no controls. After the demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics are adjusted for in Model 2, the odds ratio
for high resilience slightly increase to 1.877, which indicates
that the nonagenarians aged 94­97 with a higher resilience
score have a 87.7% (P < .01) higher chance of becoming
a centenarian as compared to their peers with similar
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics but a lower
resilience score. After further adjusting for health outcomes,
the odds ratio substantially reduces from 1.877 to 1.431,
but remains highly significant (P < .01). This indicates
that resilience has a direct effect on achieving exceptional
longevity, while part of its total effect operates indirectly
through the pathway of health. We also further estimate
the odds ratios separately for men and women in Models
4 and 5, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics and health outcomes. It turns out that the
male and female nonagenarians with higher resilience scores
have about 51.5% (P < .1) and 40.4% (P < .05) higher
chances to become a centenarian, respectively.

To our knowledge, there are no published studies which
have investigated the association of resilience with surviving
to age 100+ among nonagenarians. However, the findings
of our present study can be explained by the general
literature on resilience as the ability to adapt positively to
adversity among old adults [3]. When individuals reach
very advanced ages, accumulated negative conditions such
as health deterioration and bereavement of loved family
members represent serious challenges. Thus, nonagenari-
ans who are more resilient may have stronger capacities
and potentials for dealing successfully with these serious
challenges, constraints, and adversities [11] to subsequently
survive to age 100+.
4. Discussions and Conclusion
Based on a cross-sectional dataset with the largest sample size
to date of centenarians, nonagenarians, and octogenarians
plus a compatible group of young-old aged 65­79, the
descriptive statistics show that the average resilience score
among centenarians is lower than that of the other elderly
age groups. However, our multivariate logistic analyses
based on the same dataset have confirmed the hypothesis
that after controlling for various potential confounders
including physical health and cognitive status, centenarians
are significantly more resilient than any other age group of
the elders.
We also investigate the role resilience played in con-
tributing to exceptional longevity based on the follow-up
(up to 2008-2009) data from nonagenarians aged 94­97
in 2002 or aged 97-98 in 2005. The results confirm that
better resilience contributes significantly to the likelihood of
becoming a centenarian (i.e., exceptional longevity) among
the nonagenarians.
A previous study based on CLHLS longitudinal data
showed that on average, better resilience reduced mortality
risk by about 15.5% among all elderly adults aged 65+,
adjusted for various confounding factors including physical
and mental health [15]. Our present multivariate analysis
focuses on centenarians and nonagenarians. We have shown

that the positive effect of the resilience on enhancing the like-
lihood of surviving to the age of 100 among nonagenarians
aged 94­98 is 43.1% (P < .01) for both genders combined
(51.5% (P < .1) for men and 40.4% (P < .05) for women). It
seems that the positive effects of the resilience on survival at
very advanced ages may be more profound.
Why is resilience positively associated with survival at
very advanced ages in China? One possible explanation is
that resilience is correlated with improved physical and psy-
chological health, and better health increases the probability
of survival. As shown in our logistic regression analyses,
the effect of resilience on the likelihood of becoming a
centenarian shrinks substantially after variables of initial
health status are included in the model. Prior investigations
also lend support to this explanation. For instance, Wagnild
[5] and Lamond [3] indicated that resilience was positively
associated with physical and cognitive function. Ong [32]
demonstrated that resilient individuals were more likely to
hold positive emotions, which promoted both resistance to
and recovery from stress and thus contributed to better
health and longevity.
While the study presented in this paper is unique in terms
of its largest sample size of centenarians and nonagenarians
and interesting findings about the remarkable and significant
effect of resilience on exceptional longevity at very advanced
ages in a developing country, it should be interpreted with
caution due to its inherent limitations. First, because the
CLHLS is a demographic survey focusing on the determi-
nants of healthy longevity such as demographic characteris-
tics, socioeconomic status, life style, and health status of the
elderly, we cannot assess as many resilience indicators as with
other specific psychological surveys. Future research that
collects more sophisticated psychological data could deepen
our understanding of the impacts of resilience on healthy
longevity in China. Second, we only examine the impact
of resilience on exceptional longevity at advanced ages,
rather than the mechanisms of how resilience works. Perhaps
resilience strengthens the positive function of the immune
system and certain gene(s) or ameliorates the negative
impacts of some other gene(s). More detailed phenotypic
and genotypic data and advanced interdisciplinary research
across social and biomedical sciences are called for to explore
the mechanisms.
In conclusion, the present study provides strong evi-
dence to support the hypotheses that after adjusting for
various confounders including current health, centenarians
are significantly more resilient than any other age group of
the elderly population and that better resilience contributes
significantly to exceptional longevity even at very advanced
ages. These findings are not only scientifically meaningful
8 Current Gerontology and Geriatrics Research
but also have policy relevance, indicating that policies and
programs aiming at the promotion of resilience among old
citizens ought to be put on the agenda. We may learn
from the successful practices in other countries, such as
resilience-promotion interventions conducted in Norway,
which involve promoting expression of feeling and encourag-
ing participants' attempts to make meaningful connections
between their past, present, and future lives [33]. Such efforts
would have long-term and positive effects on the well-being
and healthy longevity for elderly citizens and their families.
