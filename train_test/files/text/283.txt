Caregivers of Frail Elders: Updating
a National Profile
Jennifer L. Wolff, PhD,1,2 and Judith D. Kasper, PhD1
Purpose: Family caregivers comprise the backbone
of long-term-care provision in the United States, yet
little is known about how the composition and
experience of family caregiving has changed over
time. Design and Methods: Data are drawn from
the 1989 and 1999 National Long-Term Care Survey
and Informal Caregiver Survey to develop nationally
representative profiles of disabled older adults and
their primary informal caregivers at two points in
time. Results: The proportion of chronically dis-
abled community-dwelling older adults who were
receiving informal assistance from family or friends
declined over the period of interest, whereas the
proportion receiving no human help increased. On
average, recipients of informal care were older and
more disabled in 1999 than in 1989. Primary
caregivers were children (41.3%), spouses (38.4%),
and other family or friends (20.4%); children were
more likely and others less likely to serve as primary
caregivers in 1999 relative to 1989. Primary care-
givers provided frequent and high levels of help at
both points in time. A striking increase was found
(from 34.9% to 52.8%) in the proportion of primary
caregivers working alone, without secondary care-
giver involvement. Implications: In the context of
projected demographic trends and budgetary con-
straints to public health insurance programs, these
data underscore the importance of identifying viable
strategies to monitor and support family caregivers
in the coming years.
Key Words: Family caregiving, Informal
caregiving, Long-term care, Disability
It is well established that, in the United States,
family caregivers comprise the backbone of the long-
term-care workforce. Unfortunately, there is little
information to suggest how, in terms of composition
and experience, family caregiving has changed over
time. The National Long-Term Care Survey
(NLTCS) and its accompanying Informal Caregiver
Survey represent a rich, nationally representative
source of information regarding both caregivers and
the disabled older adults in their care. A national
profile of caregivers to frail elders was previously
published from this data source, although this profile
was based on data that are now more than 20 years
old (Stone, Cafferata, & Sangl, 1987). Since then, two
additional waves of the NLTCS and its Informal
Caregiver Survey have been fielded. In this study we
draw from the 1989 and 1999 NLTCS and Informal
Caregiver Survey to update the profile of primary
informal caregivers to disabled older adults, and to
examine changes in the composition and experience
of this group across a 10-year period.
At this juncture there is a particularly great need
for comprehensive information about caregivers
to older adults. First, increases in longevity (Fed-
eral Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics,
2004), declining household size (U.S. Census Bureau,
2005), and a general shortage of direct health care
workers (Buerhaus, Staiger, & Auerbach, 2000) col-
lectively point to fewer caregivers for growing num-
bers of older adults in the coming years. Recent
reports of declines in unpaid assistance and greater
reliance on paid help (Liu, Manton, & Aragon, 2000;
Spillman & Pezzin, 2000) underscore the practical
implications of this issue. Moreover, estimates of the
economic value provided by family caregivers range
from $45 billion to more than $200 billion annually
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
[DHHS], 1998; Arno, Levine, & Memmott, 1999)
and highlight potential financial consequences to
society should the efforts of family caregivers be
increasingly replaced with paid assistance.

A broad understanding of caregiver circumstances
also is essential to monitoring the effects of rele-
vant policy and legislation. For example, changes
to Medicare's acute and postacute reimbursement
have created incentives to discharge medically com-
plex patients back to the community (and, there-
fore, to their caregivers) ``quicker and sicker.'' The
1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and the later
Supreme Court Olmstead v. LC (1999) ruling repre-
sent a broad societal shift toward ``rebalancing'' the
long-term-care system to reduce institutional care and
shift resources to community settings. Related federal
initiatives, such as New Freedom and the National
Family Caregiver Support Program, have implications
for family caregivers (Feinberg & Newman, 2004;
Rosenbaum, 2001), yet without empirical data it is
impossible to monitor the collective impact of these
programs.
Recent studies have drawn on the NLTCS to
examine issues related to disability and personal
care; however, these studies have largely examined
the changing dynamics of disability, or the totality
of assistance received by recipients (Liu et al., 2000;
Manton & Gu, 2001; Spillman & Pezzin, 2000;
Stone & Kemper, 1989). This study is unique in
that its focus is on caregivers to disabled older
adults. Our goal is to describe, for the two time
periods of 1989 and 1999, the composition of
disabled older adults' primary informal caregivers,
including their sociodemographic characteristics; the
intensity, frequency, duration, and scope of assis-
tance they provide; the provision of help from others;
the competing demands for their time; and the recip-
ients to whom they provide assistance.
Methods
Data
Data for this study were drawn from two linked
national surveys that together provide information
regarding both disabled older adults (the NLTCS)
and their primary caregivers (the Informal Caregiver
Survey). The NLTCS is a nationally representative
survey of Americans aged 65 years and older that
was specifically designed to study the prevalence of
chronic disability (Manton, Corder, & Stallard,
1997; Manton & Gu, 2001). Medicare enrollment
files constituted the sampling frame, and screening
interviews were conducted to determine eligibility
for a detailed interview. Among individuals who
were screened, all who were identified as chronically
disabled (indicated by institutional residence or
having any problem with activities of daily living,
i.e., ADLs, or instrumental activities of daily living,
i.e., IADLs, that had lasted or was expected to last at
least 3 months) as well as a subsample of unimpaired
individuals were selected for a detailed interview.
The NLTCS was first conducted in 1982 and has
been repeated every 5 years since 1984.
The Informal Caregiver Survey was conducted
among informal primary caregivers to community-
dwelling NLTCS participants in 1982, 1989, and
1999. Eligible caregivers included relatives or unpaid
nonrelatives who had provided one or more hours
of help to NLTCS participants with ADL or IADL
activities in the week prior to the community
interview. When more than one helper met eligibility
criteria, the primary caregiver was designated as the
helper who provided the greatest number of hours
of ADL assistance to the participant in the previous
week, or if no ADL help was provided, the helper
who provided the greatest hours of help with IADL
tasks. Primary caregivers were questioned on a vari-
ety of topics, including the nature and intensity of
help provided to recipients, help provided by others,
perceptions of their role in providing help, living
arrangements, employment, and income.
Ideally, in our analyses we would have drawn on
all three waves of the Informal Caregiver Survey, but
several modifications to its design impede compar-
isons between the 1982 survey and later waves. Most
notably, the 1982 Informal Caregiver Survey was
restricted to ADL caregivers (i.e., IADL caregivers
were excluded), but it included both primary and
secondary ADL caregivers. The 1989 and 1999 waves
included both ADL and IADL caregivers, but these
waves were restricted to primary caregivers (i.e.,
secondary caregivers were excluded). For these
reasons, our analyses focus on a comparison of the
1989 and 1999 surveys.
Study Populations: Defining Disabled Elderly
Care Recipients and Their Primary Caregivers
Comparisons across the 1989 and 1999 waves
necessitate careful attention to the construction of
comparable study samples. One consideration for
cross-wave comparisons is that the 1989 Informal
Caregiver Survey targeted eligible caregivers only
for a subsample of NLTCS participants. Specifically,
in 1989, a subsample of all participants who were
screened (6,701 of 17,565 individuals) was designated
as the sample from which Informal Caregiver Survey
interview participants would be drawn (pending
eligibility). Given our interest in making compar-
isons between 1989 and 1999, it was important for us
to comprehensively understand sampling strategies
employed by the NLTCS and Informal Caregiver
Survey across the two time periods. To evaluate
and address potential threats to study-sample com-
parability, we undertook a careful review of per-
tinent issues.
In this study, we identified chronically disabled
care recipients as individuals who both (a) screened
into the NLTCS as chronically disabled and (b)
indicated that they received active or standby help
with at least one ADL activity (eating, bathing,
dressing, toileting, transferring, and moving about
Vol. 46, No. 3, 2006 345
indoors), or received help with at least one IADL
task (grocery shopping, transportation, laundry,
light housework, money management, meal prepa-
ration, telephone use, medication management,
and outdoor mobility) that they could not perform
as a result of a health problem or disability. We
specified these criteria because a proportion of
Informal Caregiver Survey respondents indicated
providing assistance to individuals who were not
identified as chronically disabled in the NLTCS
screener interview. Additionally, the Informal Care-
giver Survey eligibility criteria did not distinguish the
reason caregivers provided assistance, and some
Informal Caregiver Survey respondents were helping
NLTCS participants for reasons other than a health
problem or disability. Failing to clearly specify
chronic disability and the underlying reason for
help in defining the recipients of care could im-
pede consistency in study-sample selection across
years.
For the purposes of this study, primary caregivers
were identified as relatives or unpaid nonrelatives
providing ADL or IADL help to a chronically dis-
abled older adult as defined herein. As discussed,
caregivers were excluded in this study if they were
found to be providing help to individuals who were
not chronically disabled, or if they provided help
for reasons other than a health problem or disability.
However, in some instances caregivers were ex-
cluded from the 1989 and 1999 Informal Caregiver
Survey study samples but were considered primary
informal caregivers for the purposes of this study.
This discrepancy arose from two distinct data issues.
First, eligibility for the Informal Caregiver Survey
was contingent on the reported provision of one or
more hours of help in the week prior to the detailed
community interview. When information on hours
was missing, for example, if the number of hours was
unknown, otherwise eligible primary caregivers were
excluded from the Informal Caregiver Survey study
sample. In this study we have included otherwise
eligible primary caregivers with missing hours; they
are included with other nonrespondents (rather than
being considered ineligible) and weighted accordingly
in analyses of caregivers. This issue is relevant to
the comparability of estimates across years, because
missing helper hours was more pervasive and
therefore disproportionately influential in 1999 rela-
tive to 1989 (7.6% in 1989 vs 11.7% in 1999).
A second and more difficult challenge arose
concerning chronically disabled individuals who
reported receiving assistance but for whom helper
payment status and relationship were not recorded.
As a result, whether the primary caregiver was
informal could not be determined. The proportion of
chronically disabled community-dwelling elderly
with helpers of indeterminate eligibility status was
1.2% and 11.5% in 1989 and 1999, respectively.
These individuals were judged to be not eligible for
the Informal Caregiver Survey. In this study, we
addressed this issue by presenting two sets of
estimates regarding characteristics of chronically
disabled older people who received help: one that
excluded individuals with helpers of indeterminate
eligibility, and another set that included individuals
with helpers of indeterminate eligibility. Information
regarding caregiver characteristics necessarily ex-
cludes helpers of indeterminate eligibility.
Table 1 provides weighted and unweighted
estimates of chronically disabled community-
dwelling older adults and their helper status. These
data indicate that the overall population of chron-
ically disabled community-dwelling older adults
increased from 5.3 million in 1989 to 5.6 million
1999. The proportion of chronically disabled indi-
viduals who received no human help increased from
22.3% to 29.5%, and the proportion who relied on
help from a paid primary caregiver increased from
6.3% in 1989 to 7.6% in 1999. Applying this study's
eligibility criteria yielded a total of 2,552 chronically
disabled older adults who received assistance from
a primary informal caregiver in 1989 (of which 977
were in the designated subsample for Informal Care-
giver Survey interview) and 1,622 such individuals in
1999. These unweighted samples were representative
of 3,733,000 and 2,880,000 community-dwelling
disabled older adults with primary informal care-
givers in 1989 and 1999, respectively. Interviews were
completed with 814 of 977 eligible caregivers in 1989
(83.3% response rate), and 1,149 of 1,622 eligible
caregivers in 1999 (70.8% response rate).
Construction of Caregiver Weights for
National Estimates
Observations from the NLTCS and Informal
Caregiver Survey must be weighted to produce
nationally representative estimates of the number
and characteristics of primary caregivers, and to
account for the complex survey design of the NLTCS.
Caregiver weights were released with both the 1989
and 1999 Informal Caregiver Survey. Although the
NLTCS-detailed community weights served as the
starting point for the caregiver weights in both years,
the methods by which the caregiver weights were
constructed differed. Specifically, in 1999 a nonre-
sponse adjustment was made that accounted for
differences in response status by recipients' age,
gender, and disability. The 1989 caregiver weights
did not include a nonresponse adjustment but were
inflated by a constant factor to account for the
selection of a subsample of the NLTCS-screened
population from which those eligible for the Informal
Caregiver Survey were identified. In both years, the
caregiver weights released with the data included
weights for caregivers to individuals who were
unimpaired at the time of the screening interview as
well as individuals who were receiving help for
reasons other than disability.
346 The Gerontologist
To ensure comparability across time periods, new
caregiver weights were constructed for this study. In
both years, detailed community weights for NLTCS
respondents who met study disability criteria were
the starting point. A nonresponse adjustment was
applied to the weights in both years, using the 1999
approach (response status of recipients by age, i.e.,
65Â­74, 75Â­84, and 85 years or older; gender; and
disability level, i.e., IADLs only, one or two ADLs,
three or four ADLs, and five or six ADLs). In
addition, we defined nonrespondents to include not
only those caregivers who were targeted and did not
complete the Informal Caregiver Survey interview,
but also caregivers who were not designated as eli-
gible for interview because hours of help were not
recorded (discussed in earlier paragraphs and in
Table 1). Information on the original nonresponse
adjustment strategy for 1989 was obtained from the
Center for Demographic Studies at Duke Univer-
sity (R. Schwartz, personal communication, March
16, 2005).
Data Analysis and Estimation
The analysis first compared demographic char-
acteristics and the functional health of disabled
older adults who were receiving assistance from
family or friends in 1989 and 1999. We then examined
the composition, characteristics, and involvement of
primary caregivers for the two time periods. Given
the recognized importance of relationship to care-
giving dynamics (Shanas, 1979; Stone et al., 1987),
we stratified analyses of caregiver characteristics,
the assistance provided and received from others,
and competing demands by primary caregiver
relationship to recipient (spouse, child, other). We
observed striking changes in secondary caregiver
involvement during the decade of interest; there-
fore, we performed additional analyses to fur-
ther elucidate circumstances surrounding these
changes.

in the ``Source and Accuracy Statement'' released by
the Center for Demographic Studies to account for
the NLTCS sampling strategy. Estimates that cannot
be considered reliable (relative standard errors
exceeding 30%) are noted in our tables. Statistical
tests of difference were calculated for differences in
estimates across the two time periods. Unless
specifically mentioned in the text, we limited notable
differences to statistically significant findings at the
.05 level. Missing data were minimal for recipient
characteristics (, 1.0% for all measures) and were
generally low for spouse and child caregivers (0.0%
to 5.5%), but were somewhat higher for other
caregivers.
Results
Who Are the Care Recipients?
Table 2 shows the characteristics of chronically
disabled community-dwelling older adults overall, as
well as those receiving assistance from an informal
primary caregiver in 1989 and 1999. Two sets of
estimates are provided (excluding and including
primary caregivers of unclear eligibility), and al-
though both indicate declines in the number of
community-dwelling disabled older adults who re-
ceived assistance from family or unpaid friends, the
magnitude of the decline is smaller when all helpers
of unknown eligibility are assumed to be primary
informal caregivers (3.8 to 3.5 million vs 3.7 to
2.9 million). In both sets of estimates, the magnitude
of decline in the proportion of disabled older adults
with informal assistance was smaller among those
disabled in five or six ADLs (from 93.4% to 85.0%
among those with an eligible primary caregiver)
compared with those with IADL disability only
(51.9% to 26.3%; data not shown).
Sociodemographic characteristics of chronically
disabled older adults receiving assistance did not
vary for the most part between 1989 and 1999. The
exceptions were increases in age and disability level.
There was a significant decline in the percentage of
care recipients with IADL disability and an increase
in the percentage with five or six ADLs between 1989
and 1999. The magnitude of this change was smaller
but remained significant when we included individ-
uals with helpers of unknown eligibility, because
these individuals tended to be less disabled.
Focusing on older adults with primary caregivers
eligible for this study (the sample of interest for all
remaining analyses) in 1999, we found that recipients
were, on average, 80 years of age and were pre-
dominantly female (66.1%), married (45.4%), or
widowed (45.1%), and most often lived with a spouse
(35.7%), with a spouse or children (29.5%), or alone
(25.4%). Recipients reported a substantial burden of
disability; 72.4% received task assistance with one or
more ADLs and 25.6% received assistance with five
or six ADLs.
Who Are the Primary Caregivers?
The proportion of spouse primary caregivers was
relatively stable across the decade of interest, but the
proportions of child and other primary caregivers
shifted, with children being more likely to take on
this role (41.3% in 1999, up from 35.9% in 1989) and
others being less likely (20.4% in 1999, down from
24.3% in 1989; Table 3). By 1999, nearly 45% of all
primary caregivers were older than 65 years of age,
with 47.4% of spousal primary caregivers being
75 years or older. In 1999, approximately two thirds
of primary caregivers were female, although male
caregivers were increasingly represented across all
relationship types over the decade of interest (p ,
.10). The distribution of primary caregivers' marital
status, self-rated health, and distance to recipients'
residence was generally stable within relationship
types across the two time periods. More than 95%
of all primary caregivers lived within 30 min of
recipients in both years; this close proximity likely
reflects the high disability levels and related needs of
disabled older care recipients.
Types and Intensity of Caregiver Assistance
Although there was long-standing primary care-
giver involvement that required substantial time
commitments at both points in time, there were some
notable shifts (Table 4). In particular, there were
significant increases in the proportion of caregivers
providing help on a daily basis, and decreases in the
proportion providing help fewer than three days per
week, with both trends being most notable among
children. While fewer than one in five caregivers had
been providing help for less than 1 year at either time
point, a significantly greater proportion of arrange-
ments were of shorter duration in 1999, a trend that
was evident across all relationship types but that was
most pronounced among children (p , .10). Lastly,
although spousal caregivers continued to provide
help with the same frequency in both time periods,
they were generally less likely to provide more than
40 hr of help and more likely to provide fewer than
10 hr of help per week in 1999 relative to 1989.
Primary caregivers most commonly reported pro-
viding help with shopping or transportation (85.3%)
and household tasks (77.7%), but high levels of
assistance were evident across all tasks. Primary
caregivers were significantly more likely to provide
assistance with indoor mobility and medication
administration but were less likely to report pro-
viding help with household tasks and shopping or
transportation in 1999 as compared with 1989; these
trends were observed across all relationship types.
Competing Demands and Secondary Assistance
There was considerable variation in the pro-
portion of primary caregivers with competing
348 The Gerontologist
demands across relationship types (Table 5). For
example, 31.6% of primary caregivers were em-
ployed in 1999, but this ranged from a low of 8.2%
among spouses to a high of 50.4% among children.
Approximately half of the employed primary care-
givers experienced some level of work conflict in
terms of rearranging their work schedules, working
fewer hours, or taking time off without pay. These
trends were fairly constant during the two time
periods, with the exception of employment and work
conflict among spouses, both of which declined over
the decade of interest.
Perhaps the most notable secular trend was the
striking increase across all relationships in the
proportion of primary caregivers ``going it alone''
without help from family, friends, or paid caregivers.
The proportion of primary caregivers without any
help from others increased significantly from 34.9%
in 1989 to 52.8% by 1999. The proportion of care-
givers who received help from family or friends de-
clined from 38.5% in 1989 to 28.0% by 1999, and the
proportion who relied on paid assistance either alone
or in conjunction with unpaid help declined from
26.6% in 1989 to 19.2% in 1999. Although declines

in the proportion of primary caregivers with paid
help was evident across all relationship types, the
drop in assistance from family or friends was more
evident among spouses and children relative to other
caregivers. As in 1989, spouses in 1999 remained
most likely to serve as the sole caregiver (67.6%),
with other caregivers being least likely (33.9%).
Secondary Support by Type and Intensity of
Caregiver Assistance
To further elucidate circumstances surrounding the
shifts in secondary caregiver involvement between
1989 and 1999, we examined primary caregiver
involvement by presence of secondary caregivers
(Table 6). Not surprisingly, primary caregivers going
it alone were most likely to be caring for the least
impaired recipients (33.9%) and least likely to be
caring for the most disabled ones (18.8%). In contrast,
primary caregivers with paid help alone or in
conjunction with unpaid help were least likely to
care for the least disabled recipients (14.5%) and most
likely to provide help to individuals with disability
in five or six ADLs (40.1%). With that said, the shift
from lower to higher levels of recipient disability was
significant across all groups of primary caregivers,
regardless of secondary caregiver involvement.
Despite increases in recipient disability, primary
caregiver involvement was remarkably stable across
the two time periods within categories of secondary
help. Primary caregivers with unpaid help provided an
average of 29 hr of help per week, which is 1 hr less
than the average of 30 hr among those who served
as sole caregivers or who relied on paid help. An
examination of primary caregiver hours in con-
junction with overall hours from all helpers high-
lights the impact of secondary caregiver support.
Total hours of help in 1999 ranged from 30 hr within
arrangements where primary caregivers received no help,

to 43 hr within arrangements where primary care-
givers' efforts were supplemented with unpaid help
from family and friends, and 62 hr within arrange-
ments where primary caregivers' efforts were supple-
mented with paid help. Whereas assistance from all
helpers increased from 47 to 62 hr per week among
arrangements with paid help, there was a decline in
total hours from 46 to 43 hr among arrangements that
relied exclusively on unpaid secondary help.
Lastly, given the striking decline in secondary
caregiver involvement between 1989 and 1999, we
examined the extent to which this finding was robust
to varied assumptions regarding primary caregiver
eligibility. Relying on unweighted data (the 1989
sampling strategy precludes the use of sampling
weights) and making the most extreme assumption
that all helpers of indeterminate eligibility were in
fact eligible primary informal caregivers with sec-
ondary caregiver involvement, we observed an in-
crease in the proportion of primary caregivers going
it alone from 34.9% to 42.5% (as compared with
unweighted estimates of 35.3% to 51.9% when
helpers of unclear eligibility were excluded; data
available upon request). Thus, the finding regarding
declines in secondary caregiver involvement does
appear to be real, despite some uncertainty regarding
its magnitude.
Discussion
This study updates a profile of primary caregivers
to community-dwelling disabled older adults and
the individuals in their care and examines changes
across two time periods--1989 and 1999. Given that
family caregivers comprise the backbone of long-
term-care provision in this country, there is re-
markably little nationally representative information
about this group of individuals, and even less in-
formation about changes in their composition and
experience over time. Our objective in this study
was to fill this void, drawing from a well-defined
nationally representative sample of disabled older
adults at two points in time, a decade apart.

Although findings related to the composition of
caregivers and the assistance provided are in some
respects predictable and stable, several important
trends merit attention.
Declines in Secondary Caregiver Involvement
There were notable increases in age and disability
in this sample of disabled older adults living in the
community and receiving assistance from family or
friends. By 1999, nearly one third of recipients were
at least 85 years of age and more than one in four
recipients were disabled in five or six ADL activities.
In light of increases in the recipients' levels of
disability, the observed increases in the proportion of
primary caregivers who reported going it alone were
particularly striking. The percentage of primary
caregivers serving as sole caregivers increased from
34.9% in 1989 to 52.8% in 1999, with declines in
assistance from secondary caregivers evident for
family and friends, as well as paid helpers. These
findings must be interpreted with caution in light of
the high proportion of disabled older adults in 1999
who reported receiving help but whose helpers
were excluded from the study as a result of missing
information on payment status and relationship.
However, we found that this trend persisted even
under the conservative assumption that all uniden-
tified helpers were informal primary caregivers with
secondary caregiver involvement. Declining second-
ary caregiver involvement has been reported by
others (Spillman & Pezzin, 2000), and it has many
possible causes, including greater geographic mobil-
ity, greater female workforce participation, increas-
ing reliance on child primary caregivers who may
have previously provided secondary support, and
environmental and technologic changes (e.g., assis-
tive technology) that may generally diminish a
person's need for human help.
Declines in the proportion of primary caregivers
with secondary helpers who were paid also were
sizeable between 1989 and 1999, and seemingly are
inconsistent with earlier evidence suggesting greater
reliance on paid care among family caregivers (Liu
et al., 2000; Spillman & Pezzin, 2000). Although the
percentage of chronically disabled older adults
relying on a paid primary caregiver increased slightly
over this time period, after taking into account
trends in secondary paid help, we found that paid
help declined overall. The time period of interest in
each analysis is an important consideration. Studies
showing increased reliance on paid care (Liu et al.;
Spillman & Pezzin) examined time periods prior to
1997, when financing of Medicare's home-health
benefit shifted from cost-based to prospective re-
imbursement. There is strong evidence that changes
to the financing of Medicare's home-health benefit
decreased services overall and shifted the mix of
home-health services away from personal care
services and toward skilled care (McCall, Korb,
Petersons, & Moore, 2003; Murtaugh, McCall,
Moore, & Meadow, 2003). Although changes in
Medicare reimbursement may have contributed to
observed declines in paid help, establishing such
a relationship is beyond the scope of these data.
Changing Caregiver Experiences
The information presented herein confirms broad
differences in the caregiving experience by virtue
of relationship. In particular, spousal primary care-
givers were most likely to serve as sole caregivers

and to provide assistance with the greatest frequency
and intensity. Child primary caregivers were most
likely to face the challenge of juggling caregiving
responsibilities along with either work or child-
rearing. It has been posited that the role of primary
caregiver is typically assumed in a hierarchy: first
spouses, then children, and finally other relatives or
friends (Shanas, 1979). Our findings are generally
consistent with this hypothesized hierarchy, al-
though there was a shift over the decade of interest
toward representation of men and greater reliance
on children. Interestingly, these data also indicate
that other primary caregivers were more likely to
provide help of greater intensity, both in terms of
hours of care and types of tasks (e.g., personal
hygiene) in 1999 relative to 1989. Unfortunately,
little detail was available regarding the specific
relationship of these other primary caregivers to
recipients.
It is counterintuitive that, in the face of significant
increases in disability among recipients and decreases
in the proportion of primary caregivers with sec-
ondary helpers, the average hours of help provided
by primary informal caregivers decreased from
31 hr to 30 hr between 1989 and 1999. In fact, these
data indicate that given the greater task needs of
recipients, primary caregivers have shifted the nature
and frequency of assistance provided. Relative to
1989, primary caregivers were more likely to provide
assistance with greater frequency and to help with
administration of medicine and indoor mobility, but
were less likely to provide help with household
tasks, shopping, or transportation in 1999. Given the
generally high levels of care being provided, care-

givers may necessarily make trade-offs about what
types of assistance to supply within a finite amount
of time, shifting help away from what are perhaps
more time-consuming and discretionary tasks to
those deemed most essential.
We found a greater proportion of chronically
disabled older adults who received no help, along
with a decrease in the number who relied on
primary informal caregivers between 1989 and 1999.
Decreases in reliance on human help (Freedman
et al., 2004; Spillman, 2004) and informal help
(Wolf, Hunt, & Knickman, 2005) have been reported
by others and may be attributed to several factors.
First, there is evidence to suggest that there have been
declines in IADL disability among community-
dwelling older adults in recent years (Freedman
et al., 2004; Freedman, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002;
Manton & Gu, 2001; Spillman), which could reduce
the need for human help. Growth in assisted living
as a residential arrangement also could partially ac-
count for fewer caregivers in this particular study, in
that individuals living with three or more unrelated
individuals in settings with medical supervision were
targeted for the NLTCS institutional interview and
were therefore excluded from the Informal Caregiver
Survey. Other plausible causes include increased use
of technology or assistive devices, or changes to the
built environment that might simplify some tasks and
diminish a person's need for human help. Whether
these observed declines reflect increased unmet need
also is an important question and cannot be ruled out.
Limitations
It is important to emphasize that this study was
restricted to primary informal caregivers rather than
all informal caregivers who provide assistance to
disabled older adults. That said, it is recognized
that primary caregivers typically provide higher levels
of assistance than other caregivers (Donelan et al.,
2002; Spillman & Pezzin, 2000; Stone et al., 1987). To
the extent that primary caregivers provide help with
the greatest intensity, are more likely to coreside with
recipients (Stone et al.), and may serve as the critical
link in maintaining community residence, they are an
important target for government, health plan, or
employer policies that provide financial support or
other assistance to caregivers.
The findings of this study vary from other reports
of family care in several important ways. First, the
study is restricted to assistance provided to disabled
older adults living in the community rather than the
entirety of individuals of all ages and in all settings
who require assistance with daily tasks. Second, this
study draws from a well-defined target population of
individuals receiving assistance and primary care-
givers actively providing help. Because of these
issues, the number of caregivers identified here as
providing assistance is substantially lower than has
been reported elsewhere (DHHS, 1998; National
Alliance for Caregiving [NAC] & AARP, 2004).
Despite differences in definitions of family care-
giving, our findings are consistent with other
published reports in several respects. For example,
the disproportionate representation of women,
spouses, and children among primary caregivers as
well as the reported duration and intensity of
assistance are comparable with the findings of other
studies (Donelan et al., 2002; NAC & AARP, 2004;
Stone et al., 1987). Findings related to the extent to
which primary caregivers were employed (NAC &
AARP) or living at a distance are lower than has
been reported elsewhere (Donelan et al.; NAC &
AARP), but they are not unreasonable given the high
levels of disability in the sample population. The
finding that about half of all employed caregivers
experienced some level of work conflict is consistent
with other studies describing the considerable
economic and personal consequences that often
accrue to employed family caregivers (Covinsky
et al., 2001; Doty, Jackson, & Crown, 1998).
In order to compare data from 1989 and 1999, we
took care to construct comparable study samples
and to provide transparency in the treatment of po-
tential threats to comparability posed by sampling
and data-collection processes of the NLTCS and
Informal Caregiver Survey. Nonetheless, different
assumptions regarding the construction of the study
samples and the eligibility of helpers of indetermi-
nate eligibility could change the magnitude of study
findings. For example, weighted estimates indicate
that the proportion of primary caregivers without
secondary caregiver involvement increased from
34.9% to 52.8% between 1989 and 1999. Sensitivity
analyses based on the most extreme assumption that
all helpers of indeterminate eligibility were in fact
eligible informal primary caregivers and that all had
secondary caregiver involvement reduced the mag-
nitude of this difference from 18% to 8%. Similarly,
sensitivity analyses related to key findings regarding
declining numbers of primary caregivers and in-
creasing disability levels of chronically disabled older
care recipients persisted under the most conservative
assumptions, albeit reduced in magnitude (Table 1).
Thus, despite a number of important data issues,
we believe the general trends reported here are
robust to the most obvious concerns regarding cross-
wave comparisons.
Policy Implications
This comprehensive profile of primary caregivers
and the disabled older adults to whom they provide
assistance has considerable relevance to policy
makers charged with crafting sustainable long-
term-care systems. The cost of long-term care in
2000 was estimated at $123 billion, and this cost is
expected to more than double to $295 billion by 2030
354 The Gerontologist
(Congressional Budget Office, 1999). These figures
are particularly impressive in that they exclude all
accounting of family caregivers' efforts. The impli-
cations of reductions in family caregivers' help could
be enormous. Other countries have moved to ex-
plicitly recognize and reward family care as part of
the long-term-care continuum (Geraedts, Heller, &
Harrington, 2000). There is some momentum in this
country toward adopting consumer-directed models
that afford greater flexibility in directing payments
to nonagency caregivers, including family, though
efforts thus far have largely been concentrated
within the Medicaid program (Benjamin, 2001;
Foster, Brown, Phillips, & Carlson, 2005; Foster,
Brown, Phillips, Schore, & Carlson, 2003).
The National Family Caregiver Support Program
is the first federal initiative to explicitly recognize
and support family caregivers. Stated goals of the
program include dissemination of information to
caregivers so that they may better access supportive
services, organization of support groups, as well as
the provision of individual counseling, training, respite
care, and other supplemental services on a limited
basis. National program funding totals $155 million,
which is small relative to the estimated contributions
of family caregivers (e.g., Arno, Levine, & Memmott,
1999; DHHS, 1998). Preliminary reports indicate
considerable variability in the program administration,
design, and service delivery of the National Family
Caregiver Support Program, but that it has increased
awareness of family caregivers (rather than only
recipients) as legitimate consumers of community
services (Feinberg & Newman, 2004).
In fact, looking more broadly than the National
Family Caregiver Support Program, there is little
consensus regarding how to best support caregivers.
Numerous caregiver interventions have cumulatively
failed to generate a strong evidence base about how to
best train and support caregivers in their diverse roles
(Knight, Lutzky, & Macofsky-Urban, 1993; Soren-
sen, Pinquart, & Duberstein, 2002; Zarit, Gaugler, &
Jarrott, 1999). In addition, most intervention studies
have targeted narrow populations of caregivers who
provide assistance to individuals with a specific index
disease (Brouwer et al., 2004; Han & Haley, 1999;
Harding & Higginson, 2003; Schulz et al., 2002),
limiting the ability to translate study findings more
broadly. Fragmented financing, multiple points of
entry, variable service offerings, and lack of a stan-
dardized approach to caregiver assessment cumula-
tively impede family caregivers' access and use of
existing community services.
This study confirms the commitment and contri-
butions of primary informal caregivers to caring for
disabled older adults living in the community.
Moreover, findings indicate that despite substantial
increases in age and disability among care recipients,
there were striking increases in the proportion of
primary caregivers providing assistance alone. These
data, in conjunction with projected increases in the
numbers of older people living with chronic illness
and disability, underscore the importance of im-
proving our understanding of what approaches most
effectively sustain family caregivers. The findings
indicate a very real need to systematically and
comprehensively monitor family caregiving and the
impact of caregiver-support initiatives in the coming
years.
