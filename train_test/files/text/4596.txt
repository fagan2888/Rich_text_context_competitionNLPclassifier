What is the Impact of Political Theory?
Thom Brooks
Durham University
I am very grateful for the contributions by Andrew Vincent, James Alexander and John Dunn to this symposium
on `impact' and political theory. Their papers provide insightful perspectives and different critical engagements with
my recent piece for this journal. Their reflections force me to revisit my central argument that the impact agenda
unveiled in the United Kingdom's new Research Excellence Framework (REF) need not be the negative
development for political theorists that many fear ­ and perhaps even that it should be embraced.
Keywords: Research Excellence Framework REF; impact; political theory
Before I respond to the criticisms of Andrew Vincent, James Alexander and John Dunn,
it is necessary to clarify misconceptions about the REF's understanding of impact. The
Research Excellence Framework (REF) is an assessment of research quality of academic
departments (as `units of assessment') across three indicators. The first is the quality of
research outputs, such as monographs and journal articles. The second is the quality of
the research environment taking into account research activities such as external speaker
seminars, postgraduate students and research funding. These indicators count for 65 and
15 per cent, respectively, of an academic subject's final score.
The newest indicator is the impact of research beyond academia, which counts for
20 per cent of the final score. So the first myth we must dispel is that the REF is
mostly about impact ­ to be clear, it is not. Impact has attracted much attention,
perhaps because of its novelty coupled with the relatively brief period between its first
announcement in 2008 for use in a REF assessment that had already started. There was
understandable concern about whether this measure could be assessed reliably. Never-
theless, impact is only one of several factors assessing research quality; to argue that
impact is the main driver for research quality is to overlook the role it plays in the
overall assessment.
A second myth is that the inclusion of impact as an indicator of research quality in the
REF requires that all research-active academics demonstrate impact in their work. This
is manifestly untrue. Impact is assessed through narrative case studies describing impact
within a period from 1 January 2008 to 31 July 2013. Academic departments were to
submit roughly one impact case study for every ten full-time academic staff included in
the assessment (REF 2011; 2012). While departments had an interest in securing a
number of high-quality impact case studies, there is no requirement or need to submit
an impact case study for every member of staff.
A third myth is that impact is assessed only by non-academics. This is also untrue.
Impact might be about the impact of research beyond academia, but its assessment is not
placed entirely beyond the hands of academics. The impact case studies are scored by
members of the relevant assessment panel. The group judging impact in Politics includes

some of the leading political scientists ­ and political theorists ­ in Britain, including
Richard Bellamy, Chris Brown, Iain McLean and Judith Squires. The Politics and
International Studies REF Panel does include a few non-academics from organisations
such as the House of Commons and the Institute for Public Policy Research. However,
the seven panel members from non-academic institutions are well outnumbered by the
22 that are academics.
Exposing these myths is important because it clarifies misconceptions about the use
of impact in the REF. Alexander discusses impact `as measured by various govern-
mental and professional agencies' (Alexander, 2015, pp. 485­486). This leads him to
examine the relation of theory and practice where we should `recognise that the
possibility of adopting a political or a philosophical ground is always open' (Alexander,
2015, p. 492). Alexander is simply wrong to believe impact is determined by gov-
ernment and related organisations. Yes, government has supported its introduction, but
academics have developed how it was measured and led its assessment. Perhaps
Alexander thinks this was a poor decision and much can be debated about that.
Nonetheless, I suspect his concern about the inability of impact to capture certain
political or philosophical possibilities rests on his mistaken belief that ministers and not
academics ­ and especially not political theorists or philosophers ­ will lead on
assessing impact. So if his fellow theorists and philosophers are unconvinced by his
arguments, Alexander cannot blame non-theorists for how impact is understood. Much
of his critique rests on a mistake about how impact is assessed.
Dunn is critical of political theorists who aim `to affect the world for the better' for they
run a risk of `professional impropriety or self-deception' (Dunn, 2015, p. 497). But this
rests on his acceptance of the myth that political theorists `measure the value of their own
work by a metric devised by public officials' or `Treasury officials' (Dunn, 2015, pp. 496
and 498). It was not politicians who designed how impact could be scored, but academics.
Moreover, Dunn understands `impact' purely in terms of affecting political decisions. This
is a mistake: impact is about influencing non-academic users, including (but not exclu-
sively) public policy makers. Even if his critique is correct, it is a partial victory at best.
Vincent argues that the use of impact creates `the "Celebrity Come Dancing" genera-
tion of academics, rushing into TV studios or other assorted external media outlets, for
their REF impact narrative' (Vincent, 2015, p. 481). This mistakes media engagement with
impact: having an active, visible media presence is good public engagement, but does not
constitute `impact' for REF purposes unless there is some identifiable change in relation to
non-academic users of 2* or better graded research. If impact should be rejected because
it is thought to be nothing more than speaking to the media, then Vincent need not worry
because this is not included as `impact' in the REF. He cites a passage by Martha Nussbaum
in a 2010 book to claim REF impact `means above all economic impact' (Vincent, 2015,
p. 482). This was an understandable concern five years ago, but the REF panels' assessment
of research impact should now help put such concerns to rest.
The discussion thus far is not a defence of the use of impact in the REF assessment.
Instead, I seek only to highlight some common myths about what this impact is. It is
important to expose certain views as mythical fictions to help us separate criticisms aimed
at the target from those addressing concerns or issues that are based on mistakes. Each

of the authors in this symposium focuses at least some part of their discussion on
concerns that do not exist ­ or at least not in the form identified. My argument
is not that this renders their critiques irrelevant, but rather I want now to turn our
attention to some of their criticisms aimed at the use of impact and not myths about
its use.
Replies to Critics
Vincent (2015) raises two issues worth considering further. The first is that not all
impact is positive. I raised the concern that many may view the impact of political
theory with suspicion given that so many in the canon opposed democracy and political
values many of us cherish today (Brooks, 2013, pp. 209­10). The pursuit of impact is
not a good in itself. However, impact for REF purposes has a specific meaning: is the
potential impact linked to 2* or better quality research? I suspect many possible
counter-examples of essays that have contributed to negative consequences would not
meet this test. Nonetheless, I have no doubt we can find illustrations of research that
contributed to negative impacts, but recall that impact is one of several indicators of a
department's overall research quality where the greatest weighting is afforded to pub-
lications. We should be concerned about the kinds of impact that research can have,
but it is best judged by panels led by academics with less importance than the quality
of publications.
A second issue Vincent raises is that research should not be market-led. However, it
is unclear how the higher education system is market-led because of REF impact. It is too
early to tell if students choose universities because of a department's impact score in the
recent REF. This is also highly unlikely. Perhaps doctoral students will give extra weight
to a department's REF score, but it is difficult to imagine `impact' scores outweighing the
importance of the department's overall score (or that many students will consider and
compare the different scores departments receive on `impact'). This is not to disagree
with him that marketisation of higher education is taking root and problematic in
important respects. However, it is also worth noting context. Almost every Member of
Parliament I have spoken to tells me they do not know exactly why impact was missing
in earlier assessments as a means of assessing `value for money'. Future prophesies are
hostages to fortune, but it is a fairly safe bet that `impact' will remain in further REF
exercises for the foreseeable future.
I have already noted how Alexander's central concern about impact rests on a mistake
about how it is assessed.1 I now address two connected issues that relate more directly to
my original article for this journal. The first issue is Alexander's worry that my `argument'
that `theorists ought to welcome the requirement their "research" should have "impact" '
is a problem because `if taken seriously, [it] would, I think, lead to the death of political
theory in all but one possible sense' (Alexander, 2015, p. 485). Alexander again rests
his concern on a mistake. I do not argue that all political theory research `should'
have impact or that theorists ought to `imitate' those that do. My actual argument is
more modest: impact is something that `political theory may ­ and often does ­
possess' (Brooks, 2013, p. 209). Not all research in this area may have impact nor
should it be required to have it to be valuable. Remember that impact is only one of

several factors in an overall assessment of research quality where outputs will continue to
reign. It is an error to think that all of a subfield might die off because of some
requirement it simply does not have. Nor do I argue anywhere that this should not
be so.2
The second, related issue is Alexander's further mischaracterisation of me and `the
standard position of political philosophers and theorists today' as endorsing the view that
political theory can and should be `untainted by practice', as theorists develop their lofty
ideals for implementation in an imperfect world (Alexander, 2015, PP. 486; 489). First,
Alexander appears to overlook the significant rise of non-ideal theory that is increasingly
a part of any `standard' discussion in the mainstream literature. And second, Alexander's
characterisation of political theory may be at odds with how most might think about the
subject as theories about the political, and thus related to our practices and institutions.
There are then reasons to reject Alexander's characterisation.
Curiously, Alexander is critical of the view of the political theorist constructing
theories separately from worldly concerns while later embracing what he calls the
`phlegmatic' relation of theory and practice where he `lets the world go to the dogs
with equanimity and simply writes philosophy where he can' (Alexander, 2015, p.
491). This suggests not that political theory must lack practical relevance, but rather
that Alexander does not attribute too much importance or value to it. This is an issue
worth considering, but it seems to rest on a further mistake. In another accusation
towards me, he says that the `sanguine' relation of theory to practice `supposes that
theories can be framed like policies for implementation' (Alexander, 2015, p. 491) ­
and among such theorists he includes myself. But this is nonsense. A theory is not a
policy, as anyone who works in public policy-making can attest. I may have a theory
of citizenship and political justice; these may guide or inform policies relating to them
like citizenship tests and language requirements, but they do not serve as the policies
themselves. My conclusion here is that Alexander's interesting distinctions and state-
ments reveal more about his individual concerns about theorists and the possibility of
their practical relevance than the actual use of impact in British higher education or
how theory does, in fact, relate to practice.
Dunn rejects the pursuit of creating impact by political theorists focusing exclusively
on their potential influence on politicians. He is dismissive of the `bewildering indiscre-
tion of the leadership' in the UK and elsewhere, doubting that they have coped
`reasonably successfully over the last few decades with their responsibilities to most of
their own citizens' (Dunn, 2015, p. 495). Such sweeping statements are offered as
obviously true, which I would dispute.
Dunn says that `a lecture room is not a church' and that `[m]ost useful educational
advice must either be broadly exemplary or highly contextual and very specific'
(Dunn, 2015, p. 497). A political theorist might not be a preacher, but this does lead
to the conclusion that there is nothing for political theorists to contribute for revising
existing public policy or developing new policy. Perhaps Dunn is correct that theorists
move at a very different speed and perspective than the policy making world he finds
so poorly run. But this is no argument against trying `to do less badly' and it is unclear
he would disagree about this point. Dunn is either mistaken or overlooks how impact

is assessed, and what it measures. However, there is much else of good sense about the
distinctive kind of projects that many political theorists ­ and especially historians of
political thought ­ engage in that I readily accept in his well-presented and thought-
provoking piece.
Conclusion
My article `In Defence of Political Theory: Impact and Opportunities' was meant to
contribute to a debate about whether the UK's impact agenda sounds the death knell for
the subfield. I argued that we, as political theorists, should welcome the use of impact
and many of us have been creating it for some time. Perhaps I should reconsider my
claim that `the primary obstacle for political theorists is overcoming scepticism about
the kind of impact theorists may offer', which I directed at non-theorists (Brooks,
2013, p. 209). The essays in this symposium make clear that impact continues to be
greeted with suspicion and some degree of alarm. I hope this reply to critics highlights
that many of these suspicions focus on myths about what impact is and how it is
assessed that are unsupported by the reality. My point is not that there is nothing to
criticise in the REF and its use of impact (there is), but to argue a case rarely
considered: that impact is not bad news for political theorists. While the essays here are
useful in raising important issues, I am unpersuaded to change my conviction. At least
for now.
Many of the problems raised about impact relate to myths and other misunderstandings
about what it is. Political theorists have a talent for conceptual analysis and grasp the finer
details about how ideas of freedom or justice take different meanings from the perspec-
tives of different philosophers. Cicero, Hobbes and Fuller may each appeal to natural law,
but each does so in different ways and generates different meanings. Likewise, the
concept of REF impact refers to a specific practice that is not the same as more everyday
understandings of impact. Once we become clearer about what REF impact is, I believe
we find that many of the objections and concerns miss their targets and it is less
objectionable than often thought. This is not to claim that REF impact is unproblematic
­ this is certainly not my view ­ but rather it does not warrant the worry many have and
is not bad news for political theorists more generally.

Notes
1 Alexander makes other mistakes as well, such as attributing statements to me that I have nowhere said in lectures or writing
(see Alexander, 2015, p. 485­486).
2 In fact, much of my early interest in political theory and philosophy arose out of purely academic curiosity without any regard
for ­ if I may once more use the stale language found in REF documentation ­ potential impact on non-academic users.
