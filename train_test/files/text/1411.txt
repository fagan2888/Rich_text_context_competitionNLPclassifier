Lipids and Pulmonary Function Cirillo et al.
Lipids and Pulmonary Function in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey
Dominic J. Cirillo, Yuri Agrawal, and Patricia A. Cassano
Studies considering the association between total cholesterol and noncardiovascular mortality, particularly
from respiratory disease, yield inconclusive findings. To explore this question, the relation of lipids to pulmonary
function, specifically forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV
1
), was investigated in the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey. Conducted in the United States in 1988­1994 among adults aged 17 years,
this survey measured serum lipids, FEV
1
, and confounding factors including smoking and antioxidants. Multiple
linear regression analysis explored the relation of FEV
1
/height2 to low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and their respective apolipoproteins (apo) B and A-I. A standard deviation
increase in HDL cholesterol or apo A-I was associated with an FEV
1
increase of 43 ml (95% confidence interval
(CI): 30, 56) or 29 ml (95% CI: 11, 47), respectively, for an average-height adult. A standard deviation increase
in LDL cholesterol or apo B was associated with an FEV
1
decrease of ­24 ml (95% CI: ­43, ­5) or ­53 ml (95%
CI: ­74, ­32), respectively, adjusted for serum antioxidant status. The lipid subfractions were differentially
associated with FEV
1
consistent with the possibility that LDL cholesterol contributes to endogenous oxidative
burden while HDL cholesterol attenuates inflammatory tissue damage. Whether these associations are causal
remains to be determined. Am J Epidemiol 2002;155:842­8.

Plasma total cholesterol has been reported to have a U-
shaped association with all-cause mortality (1­4). Although
increased total cholesterol raises the risk of cardiovascular
disease, a lower level of serum cholesterol is associated with
an increased risk of noncardiovascular causes of mortality,
including cancer and respiratory disease (1­4). Several stud-
ies found that reverse causality, whereby subclinical disease
causes cholesterol lowering, accounted for the apparent
inverse relation between cholesterol and cancer risk (1,
5­7). A remaining question is whether the association of
cholesterol with other noncardiovascular outcomes, particu-
larly respiratory mortality, is causal.
An overview of 19 observational cohort studies reported
a 30­40 percent increase in the risk of noncardiovascular,
noncancer mortality among subjects with lower total cho-
lesterol (<160 mg/dl) and an inverse relation of total choles-
terol to respiratory disease mortality (4). The associations
were unchanged after deaths occurring early in the follow-
up period were excluded and after adjustment for age, dia-
stolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, body adiposity, and
alcohol intake. More recently, Iribarren et al. reported an
inverse association of serum total cholesterol with chronic
bronchitis and emphysema mortality (3). The associations
were somewhat inconsistent but remained after early deaths
were excluded and after adjustment for confounding factors.
Frank et al. observed an inverse association between total
cholesterol and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mor-
tality that persisted after eliminating the first 5 years of
follow-up. They found that the excess risk was limited to
subjects whose cholesterol levels were below about 160
mg/dl, but they observed no relation of cholesterol to chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease mortality over the rest of the
cholesterol range (6). On the other hand, the prospective
Whitehall Study found that the association of low cholesterol
levels with respiratory causes of death did not persist in
adjusted analyses (8). However, inclusion of pulmonary func-
tion (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
)) as a con-
founding factor may compromise the validity of this analysis
if the relation of cholesterol to the risk of respiratory disease
mortality is mediated by pulmonary function.
The evidence from clinical trials is equivocal. Early
overviews of clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering medication
(4) reported higher noncardiovascular mortality at lower cho-
lesterol levels (9). The associations were marginally statisti-
cally significant, spread over several causes of death, and
unrelated to the strength of the intervention, casting some
doubt on the likelihood of a causal relation (4). Two recent
meta-analyses reported no association of cholesterol-lowering
treatment with noncardiovascular outcomes (10, 11).

Thus, the relation of cholesterol to pulmonary outcomes
is unclear. While previous studies examined respiratory
mortality or hospitalization for respiratory disease, to the
best of our knowledge published studies have addressed nei-
ther the association of cholesterol with pulmonary function
nor the possibly distinct effects of the lipid subfractions.
Using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III), we investigated the
association between lipids and pulmonary function, specifi-
cally FEV1
. Both high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were considered inde-
pendently, as were their respective apolipoproteins (apo) A-
I and B.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
NHANES III was conducted in the United States from
1988 through 1994 on a nationwide probability sample of
approximately 33,994 persons aged 2 months. Complete
details of the survey design and examination procedures
have been published by the National Center for Health
Statistics (12). For this study, the sample was restricted to
adult subjects aged 17 years, yielding an initial sample size
of 18,162.
Data collection
Trained interviewers administered a detailed socioeco-
nomic and medical history questionnaire, including a com-
plete smoking history (number of years of smoking, current
number of cigarettes smoked per day, number of years since
quitting, etc.). Further measurements were taken at mobile
examination centers, including medical examinations and
blood sample collection.
Both serum total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were
measured throughout the duration of the survey
(1988­1994), the former enzymatically and the latter fol-
lowing precipitation of the other lipoproteins (13). Both
assays were performed by using a Hitachi 704 Analyzer
(Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
Indiana). LDL cholesterol was calculated by using the
Friedewald equation: (LDL cholesterol)  total choles-
terol ­ (HDL cholesterol) ­ triglyceride/5 (14). This calcu-
lation is valid for only those subjects fasting 9 hours prior
to blood collection, with serum triglyceride levels of 400
mg/dl; thus, calculated LDL cholesterol levels are avail-
able for a subgroup of the total sample. Apo A-I and B
were measured in phase I of the survey (1988­1991); both
were assayed by either radial immunodiffusion or rate
immunonephelometry (13, 15), and the results were
adjusted according to the World Health Organization­
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry method
(13). Serum vitamin C was measured by high-performance
liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, and
serum vitamin E (-tocopherol) and -carotene were mea-
sured by isocratic high-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy with detection at two different wavelengths (13).
Serum selenium was measured by using atomic absorption
spectrophotometry. C-reactive protein was quantified by
using latex-enhanced nephelometry (13) on a Behring
Nephelometer Analyzer System (Behring Diagnostics Inc.,
Somerville, New Jersey), with a lower limit of detection of
0.21 mg/dl.
The medical examination included spirometry assess-
ments that met the American Thoracic Society minimum
spirometry recommendations (16). The US National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health spirometry sys-
tem incorporated a customized Ohio Censored 822 or 827
dry rolling seal spirometer with breathing tubes and a cali-
bration syringe; an attached computer was programmed to
analyze the expiratory curves, calculate the key pulmonary
parameters, and determine the acceptability of the tests.
Subjects were excluded from testing if they had had chest or
abdominal surgery within the past 3 weeks or if they had a
history of myocardial infarction. Each eligible subject per-
formed about five trials, and reproducibility was checked
according to the American Thoracic Society standards.
FEV1
was recorded as the highest value from all acceptable
maneuvers.
Statistical analysis
For all models, the dependent variable was FEV1
divided
by height squared. For each lipoprotein component (serum
total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apo B,
and apo A-I), a series of regression models was considered.
Initial models assessed the association of the lipoprotein
component with FEV1
, adjusting for potential confounding
factors (age, race, sex, income, and cigarette smoking repre-
sented by eight variables to fully characterize length of
exposure and dose). Further models assessed mediating
variables and effect modification by considering, for exam-
ple, body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared), serum antioxidant nutrients, and C-
reactive protein. Finally, the lipoprotein subfractions were
included simultaneously in a single model to assess the
independence of their effects. Fasting status of the subject
was considered, and analyses of the subgroup that fasted 9
hours were compared with analyses including all subjects.
Limiting analyses to fasting subjects made no difference in
the regression results; thus, only those analyses that
included all subjects are reported in this paper (with the
exception of LDL cholesterol, which was calculated for fast-
ing subjects only).
All regression analyses were adjusted for the complex
survey design by using the PROC SURVEYREG procedure
in SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
Sample weights were generated in NHANES III to account
for oversampling in certain subgroups and for nonresponse.
As per National Center for Health Statistics instructions,
specific weight variables were used in each analysis: total
sample weights were used in HDL cholesterol analyses,
phase I sample weights were used in the apolipoprotein
analyses, and fasting sample weights were used in LDL cho-
lesterol analyses (12). The weights were incorporated into
all regression analyses by using the WEIGHT statement in
SAS software.

RESULTS
The initial sample for this analysis consisted of 18,162
adults aged 17­90 years. Subjects were excluded from fur-
ther consideration if they had an unreliable FEV1
measure-
ment (i.e., the second-largest FEV1
reading not within 5
percent or 100 ml, whichever was greater, of the largest
FEV1
reading), missing FEV1
data, or missing height data
(total excluded  1,678). To address the possibility of reverse
causality (i.e., disease per se causes an altered cholesterol
level), we excluded remaining subjects with a physician
diagnosis of prevalent respiratory disease (814 subjects
reported asthma only, 158 reported emphysema only, 529
reported chronic bronchitis only, and 381 reported some
combination). Subjects with cancer (all forms except non-
malignant skin cancer) were also excluded (some with res-
piratory disease had cancer, and 467 reported cancer only),
yielding a final study population of 14,135.
The excluded subjects were similar to the final study sub-
jects regarding most variables considered (table 1).
Excluded subjects were on average older, a finding not
unexpected since one of the reasons for exclusion was
prevalent disease. The differences between the two groups
concerning other variables were largely the result of the
older age and/or the disease status of excluded subjects.
Each lipoprotein component was first considered in a sep-
arate model. The baseline models were adjusted for con-
founding variables that were not postulated to mediate the
relation between lipids and FEV1
(table 2). Both HDL com-
ponents, HDL cholesterol and apo A-I, were positively asso-
ciated with FEV1
. Both LDL components, LDL cholesterol
and apo B, were inversely associated with FEV1
, although
the association of LDL cholesterol was weak before serum
antioxidants were considered. The association of total cho-
lesterol reflected the association of the LDL components.
Given that the low- and high-density subfractions were
associated with FEV1
in opposite directions, subsequent
analyses focused on the subfractions. The linearity of these
associations was assessed by adding square terms to the
regression models. Only the LDL components showed sta-
tistically significant nonlinearity, but the nonlinear compo-
nent was weak, suggesting a slight attenuation of the inverse
association at higher lipid levels.
In these data, serum antioxidants were positively associ-
ated with pulmonary function, as reported previously by Hu
and Cassano (17). Serum antioxidants had strong positive
associations with LDL cholesterol and apo B (correlation
coefficients, 0.2­0.6) and weak positive associations with
the HDL components (correlation coefficients, 0.0­0.2).
Thus, the association of lipids with FEV1
adjusted for
antioxidants was an important consideration (table 2), par-
ticularly for the lipid-soluble antioxidants vitamin E and -
carotene. Adjusting the regression models for serum antiox-
idants (vitamin E, -carotene, vitamin C, and selenium) had
little or no effect on the coefficients for either HDL choles-
terol or apo A-I but strengthened the association of the LDL
components with pulmonary function. The inverse associa-
tion of LDL cholesterol was strengthened about threefold
and the inverse association of apo B about twofold.
Negative confounding by the antioxidants partly masked the
inverse association of the LDL components with pulmonary
function.
Further models tested for modification of the lipid-FEV1
association by lipid-soluble antioxidants. Both vitamin E
and -carotene were statistically significant effect modifiers
of the apo B-FEV1
association. For subjects whose log vita-
min E levels were one standard deviation below the mean, a

standard deviation increase in apo B was associated with a
­69 ml change in FEV1
, whereas for subjects whose log vi-
tamin E levels were one standard deviation above the mean,
a similar increase in apo B was associated with a ­45 ml
change in FEV1
. Coefficients for apo B were similarly dif-
ferent across levels of -carotene. There was no evidence
that lipid-soluble antioxidants modified the association of
either LDL cholesterol or the HDL components with FEV1
.
Lifestyle factors, including alcohol intake, adiposity, and
exercise, were also considered as confounding variables.
Alcohol intake (assessed by questionnaire; answering yes or
no to the following question: "Did you drink on 12 or more
occasions in the past year?") was positively associated with
FEV1
and with slightly higher HDL cholesterol levels.
Adjustment for alcohol intake attenuated the association of
HDL cholesterol with FEV1
by about 30 percent. Adjusting
either physical activity (answering the following question-
naire query: "Compared with most (men/women) your age,
would you say that you are more active, less active, or about
the same?") or body mass index had little or no effect on the
HDL cholesterol-FEV1
association. In adjusted analyses,
none of the lifestyle variables had any effect on the associa-
tion of LDL lipoprotein components with FEV1
.
The possible differential association of lipids with FEV1
across demographic subgroups was considered, although
there was no strong a priori hypothesis for such effect mod-
ification. For men, there were slightly larger effects for all
the lipids, but, overall, the direction and approximate mag-
nitude of the coefficients were the same across race and sex
groups, as confirmed in stratified analyses. Similarly, slight
differences were found in the magnitude of the LDL choles-
terol-FEV1
and apo B-FEV1
associations across the age
range. The associations were strongest in the middle adult
years and were slightly weaker at younger and older ages.
Undiagnosed disease may cause changes in the lipid pro-
file, contributing to reverse causality. C-reactive protein, an
acute-phase reactant, was considered as a biologic marker of
an underlying pathophysiologic process (table 2). C-reactive
protein was strongly negatively associated with FEV1
(for a
person of height 1.7 m,   ­66 ml for each milligram-per-
deciliter increase in log
e
-tranformed C-reactive protein (95
percent confidence interval: ­79, ­55)). However, C-
reactive protein had little or no relation to lipids (all corre-
lation coefficients were <0.1), and adding C-reactive protein
to the model had little or no effect on the lipoprotein-FEV1
associations. Underlying, but undiagnosed respiratory dis-
ease can be predicted by low FEV1
(18); thus, further analy-
ses excluded subjects with the lowest pulmonary function
(the lowest 5 percent of FEV1
percent predicted, in which
observed FEV1
is compared with what would be predicted
based on age, height, and sex (16)). Both the HDL choles-
terol-FEV1
and LDL cholesterol-FEV1
associations were
only slightly attenuated, and there was little or no change in
either of the apolipoprotein coefficients.
HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol are inversely asso-
ciated (in these data, r  ­0.14); therefore, further analyses
considered the independence of their effects (table 3). When
HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were included in a
single model, both retained their respective positive and
negative associations with FEV1
. The apolipoproteins had
little or no correlation in these data; consequently, inclusion
of both apo A-I and apo B in a single model made little or
no difference in their respective associations with FEV1
.
We compared the full sample and the sample excluding
those subjects with low cholesterol (i.e., total cholesterol 
160 mg/dl; n  11,162). The lipid-FEV1
associations were
essentially unchanged, except that the effect size for LDL
cholesterol was reduced by a third (p  0.2). In both groups,
the lipid-FEV1
associations were about the same across the
age range (both age and age-squared interaction terms were
included). For the low-density components, the association
was slightly larger nearer the mean age, but the direction of
the effect was unchanged in all models. Next, we considered
the low-cholesterol group separately because several past
studies have suggested an increased risk of adverse respira-
tory outcomes in this region of the distribution (total cho-

lesterol < 160 mg/dl; the number of subjects with lipid data
ranged from 1,000 to 2,000). In the low-cholesterol group,
we found statistically significant effect modification by age
for HDL cholesterol, apo B, and apo A-I. In each case, the
direction of the effect was reversed among older persons. In
young and middle age, a lower apo B level was associated
with higher FEV1
; however, at older ages, a lower apo B
level was associated with lower FEV1
. In young and middle-
age subjects, a higher HDL cholesterol level was associated
with higher FEV1
, but, in older subjects, a higher HDL cho-
lesterol level was associated with lower FEV1
. The pattern
of results was similar for apo A-I. In simultaneous models
considering both HDL cholesterol and apo B, the associa-
tion of each variable was attenuated by about 25 percent.
DISCUSSION
Prior research has suggested an association between a low
level of serum total cholesterol and an increased risk of non-
cardiovascular mortality, particularly respiratory disease
mortality (3, 4). If such a relation does indeed exist, it might
operate through an association of serum lipids with pul-
monary function, given that FEV1
is an excellent predictor
of the risk of respiratory disease and respiratory disease
mortality (19). In the NHANES III data, the total choles-
terol-FEV1
association paralleled the LDL findings: both
were inversely associated with FEV1
(lower levels were
associated with better pulmonary function). Conversely, the
HDL components were positively associated with FEV1
(lower levels were associated with worse pulmonary func-
tion). Findings were similar for both of the cholesterol and
apolipoprotein components, and the density subfractions
were independently associated with FEV1
.
Although the literature suggests an increased risk of all-
cause and respiratory disease mortality with lower choles-
terol levels, we found that associations with total cholesterol
may be misleading. The correlation of total cholesterol with
LDL cholesterol was lower in the group with low choles-
terol compared with the full sample (0.67 vs. 0.93), and the
correlation of total cholesterol with HDL cholesterol was
higher (0.16 vs. 0.09). In the low-cholesterol group, these
associations also varied by age (for the HDL
cholesterol­total cholesterol association, r  0.20 in the
young, low-cholesterol group vs. r  0.02 in the older, low-
cholesterol group), suggesting that what is conveyed by total
cholesterol differs by both age and average cholesterol level.
Moreover, the lipid subfractions were differentially associ-
ated with FEV1
, suggesting that total cholesterol is a poor
summary variable in any case.
Could the differential associations of the lipid subfrac-
tions with pulmonary function reflect an underlying differ-
ence in the biology? LDL may have an adverse effect by
contributing to endogenous oxidative burden and hence to
the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (20). In contrast, HDL may have a positive effect
through its role in immune regulation. HDL has been shown
to bind to bacterial endotoxin as well as to relieve inflam-
mation (21, 22), suggesting a potential role for HDL in pre-
venting lung tissue damage. Cholesterol also is a constituent
of lung surfactant; however, the relation of surfactant prop-
erties to FEV1
, or the possibly distinct relations of the lipid
subfractions to surfactant, is unclear.
We stratified the sample by total cholesterol, since previ-
ous studies found an excess risk of noncardiovascular mor-
tality primarily for persons whose total cholesterol levels
were <160 mg/dl. In the low-cholesterol group, there was
heterogeneity by age: among young and middle-age persons
with low cholesterol, the findings were similar to those for
the total sample: higher LDL components were associated
with worse lung function, and higher HDL components
were associated with better lung function. However, for
older persons with low cholesterol, lower LDL components
were associated with worse lung function, a result consistent
with the finding that lower total cholesterol is associated
with a greater risk of respiratory disease (and, in this sub-
group, total cholesterol had little or no correlation with HDL
components so would mainly reflect LDL components).
There may be additional heterogeneity among the subgroup
of older persons with low total cholesterol, given that,
for some, levels may be stably low while for others they
may be acutely low and/or declining (23). If a biologic rela-
tion underlies observations that lower cholesterol increases
the risk of respiratory outcomes, advancing our understand-
ing rests on further consideration of effect modification by
age, lipid subfractions, and longitudinal patterns in lipid
subfractions.
These NHANES III findings may reflect a biologic
process or may have resulted from reverse causality and/or
confounding not adequately addressed in this cross-
sectional study. If preexisting disease that compromises pul-
monary function also affects serum cholesterol (23, 24), the
disease may induce the association of the lipid subfractions
with FEV1
. Although this issue cannot be fully addressed in
this cross-sectional study, analyses excluding all prevalent

Other analyses explored the extent to which these associa-
tions may be explained by confounding factors. The lipopro-
tein components may be markers for some other aspect of diet
or lifestyle that may affect both lung function and the levels
of HDL and LDL. A series of models addressed known pre-
dictors of both pulmonary function and lipid level to identify
confounding factors that might account for the associations
we observed. None of these models identified important
sources of confounding, although some lifestyle variables
were poorly measured in these data (for example, alcohol
intake); thus, residual confounding is indeed possible.
Confounding may also occur if an underlying condition that
led to pathologically high lipid levels might, through other
mechanisms, affect pulmonary function. Excluding subjects
with clinically abnormal total cholesterol levels (defined as
either the top 5 percent or higher than 220 mg/dl) had little or
no effect on the reported associations. Since chronic inflam-
mation has been shown to cause hypocholesterolemia in older
people (23), a proxy for inflammation (C-reactive protein)
was considered, but no changes were observed in any of the
lipoprotein-FEV1
associations.
Age significantly modified the association between LDL
and FEV1
. FEV1
declines with age, while LDL cholesterol
increases with age up to late middle age, after which it
plateaus and then declines. The LDL-FEV1
association was
strongest in the age range in which both lung function and
lipid levels are changing with age (in opposite directions,
hence the inverse association). HDL components do not
vary much by age, and no difference was found in the HDL-
FEV1
association by age. Further research should explore
this finding.
If the effect of lipoproteins on noncardiovascular mortal-
ity was due solely to cholesterol's correlation with antioxi-
dants, as suggested in a recent review (1), then controlling
for four serum antioxidants known to affect lung function
would be expected to attenuate the association of FEV1
with
the lipoprotein components. The dramatic increase in the
magnitude of the LDL-FEV1
association suggested that
there was in fact negative confounding by the serum antiox-
idants. In cardiovascular disease, the mode of action of LDL
involves oxidation of the LDL particle into a more potent
atherogenic agent (25), a process that can be reversed by
antioxidants (26). We hypothesized that, at lower levels of
antioxidants, there might be increased levels of oxidized
LDL contributing to the overall levels of endogenous oxida-
tive burden in the lung. Thus, we tested antioxidant-LDL
interactions and found that, at lower levels of both vitamin
E and -carotene, the association of apo B with FEV1
was
strengthened, as hypothesized.
From a measurement perspective, apo B is thought to
have less "noise" than LDL cholesterol as a measure of the
LDL subfraction because of the variable density of LDL
cholesterol on LDL particles (15). In addition, there may be
different levels of measurement error in the two constituents
given that apo B was measured directly, while LDL choles-
terol levels were calculated by using the Friedewald equa-
tion (14). Similarly, HDL cholesterol may have less noise
than apo A-I as a measure of the HDL subfraction because
of the dynamic exchange of apo A-I proteins between HDL
particles (15). In models that considered these lipoprotein
components simultaneously, apo B and HDL cholesterol
retained strong, significant, independent associations with
pulmonary function, perhaps reflecting the measurement
issues described above, although the degree of association
between the particle components (LDL cholesterol and apo
B: r  0.85; HDL cholesterol and apo A-I: r  0.76) pre-
cludes a definitive conclusion. Subsequent research should
consider whether there may be distinct functional roles in
lung tissue for the lipid versus protein component of the
lipoproteins.
A strength of this study is that it used data from a nation-
ally representative population sample with high-quality
measurement (13, 27). An interesting finding is that the
lipoprotein subfractions have differential associations with
pulmonary function. The fact that previous attempts to relate
serum total cholesterol levels with respiratory outcomes
were inconsistent may be partly explained by the lack of
consideration given to the lipid subfractions. Because a sin-
gle measurement of the lipid components contains noise
(i.e., random error) relative to the usual, long-term average
level, our findings may have been affected by regression
dilution bias, and the true magnitude of these associations
may be larger.
Further research should consider how the range of popula-
tion cholesterol levels affects the cholesterol-FEV
1
associa-
tion (e.g., by studying a naturally low cholesterol population).
Such research should also shed light on whether chronically
lower cholesterol levels are qualitatively different from
acutely lowered cholesterol levels achieved through drug
treatment. Future studies should also investigate the time
course of the cholesterol-FEV1
relation by using longitudinal
data (e.g., by studying changes in lipids in relation to the age-
related decline in pulmonary function).
