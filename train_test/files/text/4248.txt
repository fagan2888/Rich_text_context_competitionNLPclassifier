Introduction
Primary aldosteronism (PA), described by Conn in 1955,1
is one of the most common endocrine cause of secondary
hypertension. The prevalence of PA is more than 10% in
hypertensive patients.2 Moreover, PA patients tend to
experience more cardiovascular events than those with
essential hypertension (EH).3 Consequently, an accurate
and early diagnosis of PA is essential, as specific treatment
can alleviate its impact on mortality. As recommended by
the guidelines, the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) is cur-
rently used for PA screening.2 An elevated ARR indicates
the possibility of PA but further confirmatory testing is
required. Conventionally, the plasma aldosterone concen-
tration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA) are meas-
ured to calculate ARR (PAC/PRA). However, PRA
measurement is influenced by various factors, e.g. angio-
tensinogen concentration, incubation conditions, pH value,
and it shows poor inter-laboratory reproducibility.4 To
avoid these issues, the measurement of direct renin con-
centration (DRC) is appropriate to determine ARR (PAC/

Abstract
Objective: The accuracy of aldosterone/direct renin concentration ratio (ADRR) as a screening test in patients with
primary aldosteronism (PA) varies widely across the studies. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the
accuracy of ADRR.
Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library published between
April 1971­February 2016. Studies focusing on the accuracy of ADRR for PA screening were included. Two authors
independently extracted information regarding patient characteristics, antihypertensives status, true positives, true
negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The random-effects model was used for statistical analysis. Heterogeneity
was explored by subgroup analysis and meta-regression.
Results: Nine studies involving 974 patients were included. The overall sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, and
diagnostic odds ratio of ADRR were 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84­0.93), 0.96 (95% CI 0.95­0.98), 0.985 and
324 respectively, with substantial heterogeneity. Meta-regression showed that antihypertensive status affects the ADRR
and may account for the heterogeneity (p=0.03). Subgroup analysis of patients who discontinued the antihypertensives
revealed a sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95­1.00) and a specificity of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96­0.99).
Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of ADRR as a screening test for PA. However, as antihypertensive
drugs can interfere with the interpretation of ADRR, it is recommended to interrupt therapy or at least replace with
analogues that do not significantly affect the ADRR value.

DRC). The DRC assay provides several advantages com-
pared with PRA, e.g. specimen handing, shorter turn
around time, better reproducibility, and easier standardiza-
tion.5 Correlation between DRC and PRA is generally
good except when concentration of PRA is below 1 ng/
ml/h.5,6 Meanwhile, the diagnostic efficiency of plasma
aldosterone/direct renin concentration ratio (ADRR, PAC/
DRC) was varied in studies,7­19 and no general consensus
regarding the impact of antihypertensives on the measured
ADRR value is available.
Accordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess
the accuracy of ADRR, and the impact of antihyperten-
sives on PA screening.
Methods
Search strategy and study criteria
The electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and the
Cochrane library were screened for the following keywords:
"primary aldosteronism," "primary hyperaldosteronism,"
and "renin concentration."- The search was limited to publi-
cations in English on human subjects. The period fromApril
1971­February 2016 was included in the search; the related
bibliographies were screened for relevant additional studies.
The abstracts of the studies were independently evaluated
according to the inclusion criteria by two authors (XL and
RG). Studies were included when fulfilling the following
points: (a) studies using at least one of the four confirmatory
tests (oral sodium loading test, saline infusion test, fludro-
cortisones suppression test, and captopril challenge test)
recommended by guidelines2 or if a histopathological diag-
nosis for PA was made; (b) studies discussing the accuracy
of diagnosis forADRR in PAscreening and a 2×2 table with
a certain cut-off could be constructed; and (c) the availabil-
ity of a full text publication.
Data extraction
Two reviewers (XL and RG) independently performed the
data extraction of all selected studies. The extracted data
consisted of information about the first author, year of
publication, sample size, gender, original cut-off for a pos-
itive result, antihypertensives status, blood sampling con-
ditions, potassium concentration, and a 2×2 table of true
positives, true negatives, false positives, and false nega-
tives. For a better comparison the ADRR units (pmol/l)/
(mU/l) were divided by 1.76 to convert to (ng/l)/(ng/l) as
per the guidelines.2 Disagreements were resolved by dis-
cussion until consensus was reached. Authors were con-
tacted for additional information if the required data were
unclear or were not presented in the full article.
Quality assessment
The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies
(QUADAS-2) criteria recommended by the Cochrane
Collaboration was used to evaluate the methodological
quality of each included study.20 QUADAS-2 criteria con-
sist of four key domains: the patient selection, the index
test, the reference standard, and the flow and timing of
samples/patients along the study. Each is assessed in terms
of risk of bias and the first three in terms of concerns
regarding applicability. Each key domain was graded as
"low," "high," or "unclear," if information for accurate
judgment was lacking.
Statistical analysis
First, the threshold effect was evaluated by the Spearman
correlation coefficient. Meanwhile, I² was used to evaluate
the influence of heterogeneity between studies caused by
inconsistencies instead of chance. The quantity I² ranges
from 0­100%, where 0% indicates the unobserved hetero-
geneity and more than 50% may represent substantial het-
erogeneity. The random effects model was used when I²
was more than 30%. Pooled sensitivity and specificity esti-
mation points with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated for PA screening. Forest plots were used to dis-
play sensitivity and specificity in this study. For each out-
come, the summary receiving operation characteristic
curves and the respective area under the curve (AUC) were
constructed for accuracy. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR)
is the ratio of the odds of a positive test result in a patient
with disease compared with the odds of a positive test result
in a patient without disease. It is the best indicator of test
performance. To explore the causes of heterogeneity among
the studies, meta-regression as well as subgroup analysis
was performed. More than four studies in a subgroup were
selected to achieve more credible results. For meta-regres-
sion, the residual maximum likelihood method was used to
estimate between­study variance, and the discontinuation
of antihypertensives was included as a covariate. Funnel
plots were constructed to allow visual inspection for poten-
tial publication bias.21 All analyses were performed with
Meta-Disc version 1.4. The funnel plots were constructed
by STATAversion 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station,
Texas, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided, with a p
value of 0.05 denoting statistical significance.
Results
The literature search identified 1043 articles (Figure 1).
The titles and abstracts of all articles were screened.
Twenty-one articles were retrieved for full text evaluation.
Nine articles7­15 of these, met our inclusion criteria for
final meta-analysis as summarized in Table 1. From all
reviewed studies, the most common reasons for exclusion
were the following: (a) the study was unable provide the
basis for a 2×2 table with a specific cut-off (n=6); (b) the
study did not use any confirmatory tests in diagnosing PA
(n=5); and (c) the study used the post-captopril DRC
(n=1). In total, nine studies including 974 subjects were
selected; PA patients were recruited as patient groups in all
Li et al. 3
of the studies whereas one study included only patients
with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), a subtype of
PA, as their patient group. However, the definition of con-
trol group varied in the studies. EH patients were
assigned as controls in six studies.7,9,10,13­15 Normotensive
and EH subjects were recruited as controls in the study
conducted by Corbin et al.8 Normotensive subjects were
also used as controls in the study conducted by Perschel
et al.11 Lastly, in the study by Tzanela et al.,12 the control
set comprised 79 subjects without suspected adrenal dis-
eases, 27 members were hypertensive and the other 52
were normotensive. The cut-off of ADRR ranged from
26.35 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)) to 59.66 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)). Five stud-
ies8,9,11­13 interrupted antihypertensive-therapy, ranging
from three days to six weeks, before blood sampling. An
upright posture was used for blood sampling in most stud-
ies,7­9,11­14 while in one study blood samples were col-
lected in the supine position.10
Risk of bias and applicability judgments
The risk of bias is shown in Table 2. In the risk of bias,
only one study used normotensives as a control group and
thus had a high risk of bias in the selection of patients. As
to the index test, most studies had high risk, as they did not
pre-specify the cut-off values for ADRR. Regarding the
reference standard as well as flow and timing, none of the
studies showed a high risk. In applicability bias, a high risk
of bias was not found in applicability except for one study,
which recruited normotensive subjects as its control group.
Overall analyses and publication bias
There was no threshold effect because the Spearman
correlation coefficient showed no correlations between
sensitivity and specificity (r=-0.33; p>0.05). The pooled
sensitivity and specificity of the studies overall were 0.89
(95% CI 0.84­0.93) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.95­0.97), respec-
tively (Figure 2(a)). The I² for sensitivity (90.1%) and
specificity (90.6%) was more than 50%, representing a
high level of inconsistency among studies. In the random
effects model, the symmetric area under the curve (SAUC)
of nine studies was 0.985 (Figure 2(b)). In addition, the
DOR was 324.
No evidence of publication bias was found (p=0.195),
as shown in Figure 3.
Meta-regression and subgroup analysis
The meta-regression analysis showed that the status of
antihypertensives had a significant influence on heteroge-
neity (p=0.03). Five studies regarding discontinuation of
antihypertensives were analyzed to evaluate the impact of
discontinuing antihypertensives on the diagnostic accu-
racy of ADRR. The pooled sensitivity increased to 0.99
(95% CI, 0.95­1.00), while the specificity increased to
0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), respectively (Figure 4(a)). In
addition, the I² of sensitivity and specificity decreased to
32% and 81%, respectively. The SAUC showed an
enhanced accuracy (SAUC=0.993). However, pooled sen-
sitivity and specificity of the four studies where antihy-
pertensives were not discontinued decreased to 0.73 (95%
CI, 0.62­0.82) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90­0.96), respectively
(Figure 4(b)). Six studies that set EH patients as the con-
trol group showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI
0.76­0.89) and specificity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91­0.96)
(Figure 4(c)).
Discussion
The reported accuracy of ADRR in the screening of PA was
inconsistent (the sensitivity ranged from 0.28­1.00 and the

specificity ranged from 0.56­1.00). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis designed to evalu-
ate the accuracy of ADRR in PA screening. This meta-
analysis demonstrated that for PA screening, ADRR had a
sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI 0.84­0.93), a specificity of 0.96
(95% CI 0.95­0.98) and SAUC of 0.985, respectively. The
diagnostic accuracy is at least comparable with previous
studies where ARR was based on the PRA.16 Furthermore,
the DOR of 324 also showed ADRR to be an efficient test.
The quality of the studies was good according to the

valuable.

The analysis also demonstrated a massive heterogeneity,
especially for sensitivity. Various reasons clarify this high
degree of variability. Firstly, the cut-off of nine studies was
variable and ranged from 26.35 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)) to 59.66
((ng/l)/(ng/l)), which may be due to different populations,
confirmatory criteria, and approach to cut-off decisions.
Secondly, the control selection might induce heterogeneity.
Regarding inclusion criteria of the control groups, one
study included normotensive people whose average ADRR
was lower than that of EH patients,11 which inevitably led
to an overestimated diagnostic accuracy, with elevated sen-
sitivity and specificity. As our study showed, the pooled
sensitivity and specificity of the six studies that used EH
patients as controls were decreased compared with the total
pooled sensitivity and specificity. Thirdly, regarding the
patient groups, there were several inconsistent factors such
as age, gender, confirmatory test, subtype of PA, and con-
centration of potassium, which might also induce hetero-
geneity. The influence of potassium on aldosterone and
vice versa cannot be ignored.22 Moreover, the potassium
levels of PA subjects were low in most studies, leading to
inhibition of aldosterone secretion and low PAC levels.
Lastly, the status of antihypertensive drugs and blood sam-
pling positions varied among the nine studies. Yin et al.
showed that the accuracy of ARR fluctuated with the dif-
ferent blood sampling positions.23 Consequently, it can be
easily inferred that ADRR accuracy varied with changes of
blood drawing position as ARR did. However, studies on
this issue are rare.
Furthermore, discontinuation of antihypertensives and
cut-off selection might be possible interpretations for the

of sensitivities and specificities of the four studies without discontinuation of antihypertensives. (c) Forest plot of sensitivities and

outliers of the forest plots. Jansen et al. enrolled persistent
hypertensive patients on several antihypertensives, and the
proportion of diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers,
and calcium channel blocker nearly reached 80% in PA and
EH groups, which resulted in a relatively lower sensitivity.14
Fischer et al. selected 31.54 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)) as the cut-off,
which might lead to a relatively lower specificity.15
There are some studies that discuss the effects of anti-
hypertensives on ADRR.14,15,24­27 In theory, -blockers
lead to a significant suppression of renin and less signifi-
cantly altered aldosterone, which results in an elevated
ADRR. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
and angiotensin II receptor blockers increase renin levels
and decrease aldosterone concentration. It is well known
that these molecules increase the ADRR, yet their effects
in terms of influence on the AUC and the cut-off are still
under investigation.14,24,28 In addition, it is dangerous to
stop antihypertensives in PA patients who have various
complications or severe hypertension. In this study, ADRR
in subjects who discontinued antihypertensives had sig-
nificantly increased sensitivity (0.99 vs 0.72) and specific-
ity (0.98 vs 0.94) compared with those who continued the
antihypertensives. It is highly recommended to stop anti-
hypertensives before PA screening or at least substitute the
drugs with less interfering ones as per recommendations of
the screening test.
Five studies16­19,29 were excluded as they used confirm-
atory criteria not recommended in the guidelines.2 They
showed cut-offs of 50 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)),18 90 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)),19
43.5 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)),17 19 (pg/U) (as 30 ((ng/l)/(ng/l))),29
100 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)) in cases of blood sampling in the supine
position, and 164 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)) in cases where subjects
were ambulant,16 respectively. The sensitivity ranged from
0.60­1.00, whereas the specificity ranged from 0.91­1.00.
The poor sensitivity of 0.60 is probably due to the continu-
ation of antihypertensives, the inappropriate cut-off, the
improper confirmatory criteria, and the incorrect measure-
ment procedure. It should be noted that two studies com-
bining ADRR with aldosterone concentration are more
accurate,18,19 which requires further research. One study
was excluded due to measurement of ADRR after the use
of captopril, it showed a sensitivity of 0.75 and specificity
of 0.86 under the cut-off of 35.5 (pmol/ng) (as 12.82
((ng/l)/(ng/l))).30
This analysis has several limitations. The lack of a
golden standard for PA diagnosis and consistent study
design lowered the power of this study. The fact that we
used the sensitivity and specificity rather than positive and
negative likelihood ratios as main outcome measures is a
limitation, strictly, due to the various cut-offs used.
However, sensitivity and specificity are easy to understand
and widely used by clinicians.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis reveals that ADRR
has a sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI 0.84­0.93) and the speci-
ficity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.95­0.98) at cut-offs ranging from
26.35 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)) to 59.66 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)). This suggests
that the determination of ADRR is an effective and con-
venient screening tool for PA. The discontinuation of anti-
hypertensives is necessary when using ADRR for PA
screening, and further clinical investigation is required.
Over all, DRC may be widely used due to its easy meas-
urement and standardization.
