Geographic Distance and Contact
Between Middle-aged Children and Their Parents:
The Effects of Social Class Over 20 Years
Lisa Greenwell and Vern L. Bengtson

This research derives and tests hypotheses from two alternative conceptual models: the modified extended family
model, and the changingfamily constraints model, which takes into account recent changes in work andfamily life.
The hypotheses address social class differences in geographic distance and contact frequency between middle-aged
children and their parents over time. Simultaneous probit models are used to analyze distance and contact as jointly
determined outcomes with datafrom the USC Longitudinal Study of Generations and Mental Health. Results from
these analyses indicate that children'sl971 educational aspirations and social classposition predict 1991 distance and
contact between generations. Parents who have lower 1991 incomes, however, livefarther from children and talk with
them on the telephone less frequently than higher-income parents. Thus, the effects of early social class position
support the modified extendedfamily model, whereas the effects of current social class position support the changing
family constraints model.
AS parents age, they may depend more on their children
L for social support (Ingersoll-Dayton and Antonucci,
1988), and thus rely more on children being close by or in
frequent contact with them. A family's social class position,
however, may have long-term effects on both geographic
distance and frequency of contact between generations.
Social class has enduring effects on changes in family
resources and relationships over the life course (Oppen-
heimer, 1981). These changes may affect aging parents'
future proximity to, or contact with, their adult children.
The modified extended family model, proposed by Litwak
(1960a, 1960b, 1985), suggests that middle- and working-
class families have different ways of adjusting distance and
contact in order to fulfill commitments to family members
while also meeting the achievement demands of modern
society. The model, however, assumes that both middle- and
working-class people will have stable careers and families,
which will give them the resources to adjust geographic
distance or frequency of contact with their parents later in
life. Yet the availability of stable careers has decreased in
recent decades (Marshall, 1995; O'Rand, 1996) while fam-
ily instability has risen (Bumpass and Raley, 1992; Wilkie,
1991). Such changes may have particularly adverse effects
on aging working-class parents, since they depend a great
deal on immediate kin for social support (Litwak, 1985).
Despite these changes in work and family life, researchers
in the sociology of aging have yet to investigate whether the
modified extended family model still accurately predicts the
effects of early social class position on both geographic
distance and frequency of contact between generations.
Often, in fact, researchers estimate the effects of distance on
contact without considering the possibility that early social
class position may influence both distance and contact
(Frankel and DeWit, 1989; Hoyert, 1991; Kivett and Atkin-
son, 1984; Spitze and Logan, 1990a; Waite and Harrison,
1992). Research that does not take this possibility into
account, however, may produce biased estimates of the
relationship between distance and contact (Wolf, 1994).
In this article, we analyze the relationships between fam-
ily social class position and the kind and degree of contact
between middle-aged children and their parents, as well as
the relationship between contact and geographic distance.
Two alternative sets of hypotheses are tested. The first,
derived from the modified extended family model (Litwak,
1960a), predicts that social class is related to distance and in-
person contact; the second predicts that social class is no
longer strongly related to distance or in-person contact due to
changing constraints on family resources. Data from the
1971 and 1991 waves of the University of Southern Califor-
nia Longitudinal Study of Generations and Mental Health
are used to examine social class effects over a period in
which substantial changes in work and family life occurred.
The conceptual models assume that early social class posi-
tion and family commitments may affect both later geo-
graphic distance and later contact frequency. Thus, the
statistical techniques used in the research adjust for this joint
determination of distance and contact.
BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES
In his landmark studies of families and aging, Litwak
(1960a, 1960b, 1985) takes issue with Parsons' (1953)
position that "there is a basic disharmony between modern
democratic industrial society and extended family relations"
(Litwak, 1960a, p. 9). While Litwak (1960a) shares Par-
sons' structural-functional theoretical perspective, he con-
tends that, due to the different needs of middle-class families
and working-class families, different extended family struc-
tures provide important functions in each social class. Speci-
fically, Litwak (1960a) is concerned with how particular
family structures help individuals balance the achievement
S13
S14 GREENWELL AND BENGTSON
demands placed upon them by modern, industrial society
with the needs of their family members for social support.
He argues that this balance is best achieved among people in
middle-class occupations and among those who are occupa-
tionally mobile by the modified extended family, in which
there is greater geographic distance but fairly frequent con-
tact between generations. The balance is best achieved
among people in working-class occupations by the tradi-
tional extended family, in which there is geographic proxim-
ity (or coresidence) and frequent contact between genera-
tions (Litwak, 1960a).
The modified extended family model, however, was for-
mulated at a time when it was more commonly assumed that
middle-class careers promised upward mobility, and that
long-term working-class jobs, while not universally avail-
able (e.g., Komarovsky, 1967), could realistically be as-
pired to due to the presence of a strong industrial sector
sustaining relatively stable working-class communities
(Bluestone and Harrison, 1982; Rubin, 1994). Members of
both middle and working classes could thus expect to ad-
vance their careers while accumulating sufficient resources
to help their close kin in times of need. These expectations,
however, may now be unrealistic, particularly among mem-
bers of the working class. Accompanying deindustrializa-
tion, decreases in unionization, and the decline of working-
class communities (Bluestone and Harrison, 1982), real
wages have stagnated, especially among working-class men,
for over two decades (Wilkie, 1991). Employers have
moved away from offering jobs that promise lifetime careers
(O'Rand, 1996). Divorce has increased, and continues to do
so among those with low education levels (Bumpass and
Raley, 1992). Education has become more expensive, but
provides a less certain route to job advancement (Rubin,
1994).
The modified extended family model may not adequately
account for these recent changes, or for their disproportion-
ate effects on the working class. Consequently, this study
proposes an alternative, the changing family constraints
model, which takes into account the cumulation of disadvan-
tage (Crystal and Shea, 1990; O'Rand, 1996) that might now
better describe social class differences in the prospects for
balancing individual achievements with family support
needs over the life course. In describing these two models,
we conceptualize social class, based on Max Weber's (1972
[1946]) work, as a set of positions, defined primarily by
education, occupation, and income, that shape people's
chances for attainment and well-being over the life course
(Western and Wright, 1994).
Our analysis focuses on middle-aged children and their
parents. Middle-aged people typically are at the peak of their
work careers, but are approaching a time of life when their
provision of care to both younger and older family members
may be required (Brody, 1981; Spitze and Logan, 1990b).
Thus, they may have begun anticipating the need to adjust
distance from or contact frequency with their parents. Also,
those who are currently middle-aged are members of the baby
boom cohort, and thus were exposed to recent changes in
work and family life in the early stages of their adult life
(Wilkie, 1991). Consequently, their situation should provide
a good test of whether the modified extended family model or
the changing family constraints model best describes current
patterns of distance and contact between generations.
The following sections lay out the implications of the
modified extended family and changing family constraints
models in greater detail; first for distance, and then for
contact. These are summarized in two alternative sets of
hypotheses. The relationship between distance and contact is
then examined in order to specify an analytic model appro-
priate to test the hypotheses.
Geographic Distance and Social Class
Socioeconomic attainments and early plans for these at-
tainments made by both parents and children are likely to be
major influences on the geographic distance between genera-
tions over the life course. When children reach early adult-
hood, a primary goal of their leaving home is the pursuit of
socioeconomic attainment through education, work, and
family formation; these are goals that parents also are likely
to share. In addition, however, the theory of intergenera-
tional solidarity (Bengtson and Roberts, 1991; Silverstein
and Litwak, 1993) implies that geographic distance will be
adjusted over time based on the changing needs and re-
sources of both generations. In fact, recent studies find that
adult children's economic needs have strong influences on
proximity to, or coresidence with, parents earlier in the life
course. Parents' economic and health needs, however, be-
come stronger influences on geographic proximity later in
the life course (Aquilino, 1990; Crimmins and Ingegneri,
1990; Silverstein, 1995; Speare and Avery, 1993; Spitze and
Logan, 1990a).
According to the modified extended family model, the
pursuit of individual attainment itself brings about the condi-
tions needed to actualize this apparent reciprocity between
generations over the life course (Litwak, 1985). The model,
however, suggests that social class differences operate
through the life course such that middle-class adult children
will live farther away from their parents than will those in
the working class (Litwak, 1960a). Training for highly
skilled middle-class occupations typically involves a spe-
cialized education, which may not be available near home,
and requires several years to complete. Also, many middle-
class occupations are located in geographic-specific labor
markets that may be far from parents' homes (Litwak,
1985). Middle-class parents, however, typically are still
working, have earnings that continue to increase, and are in
good health until late in life (House et al., 1994; Oppen-
heimer, 1981; Preston and Taubman, 1994). These parents
may thus have no need for their adult children to move closer
to them until the children reach late middle adulthood. By
this time, the children's careers should be sufficiently estab-
lished to allow for greater geographic mobility (in the form
of lateral job changes) should parents' needs increase (Kulis,
1991; Litwak, 1960b).
Working-class occupations, by contrast, are assumed by
the modified extended family model to be available in the
local community. Such jobs are often acquired through
friends and family members, and since they typically do not
require a college education, are begun early in life
(Granovetter, 1974; Litwak, 1960a, 1985; Wilson, 1987).
Consequently, by the time they reach middle age, working-
SOCIAL CLASS, DISTANCE, AND CONTACT S15
class children will often have stable, well-paying jobs. The
health of their parents, however, may begin to decline
around this time (House et al., 1994; Oppenheimer, 1981;
Preston and Taubman, 1994), suggesting that parents may
need a geographically proximate child's assistance. Indeed,
even at later life-course stages, intergenerational proximity
seems to be more common among those in lower social class
positions than among those with more income or education
(Crimmins and Ingegneri, 1990; Hoyert, 1991; Litwak,
1960a; Soldo, Sharma, and Campbell, 1984; Wolf and
Soldo, 1988; but see Spitze and Logan, 1990a, for some
contrasting findings).
In contrast to this scenario, the changing family con-
straints model suggests that in both the middle and the
working class, it has become more difficult to accumulate
the career and financial resources that lead to control over
one's geographic location by middle age. In the middle
class, however, such changing family constraints may be
adjusted to more easily than in the working class. The life-
style practices of middle-class young adults, which include
late marriage and childbearing (Oppenheimer, 1981; U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1991), facilitate the acquisition of
advanced education, which has become increasingly neces-
sary for socioeconomic attainment in recent decades (Op-
penheimer, 1981). Further, these life-style practices have
helped compensate for stagnating wages in the baby boom
cohort (Easterlin, Macunovich, and Crimmins, 1993). Liv-
ing with parents for a longer period of time may also
facilitate the pursuit of advanced education, and does not
unduly tax parents' relatively high resources (Avery, Gold-
scheider, and Speare, 1992; Rubin, 1994).
In the working class, by contrast, there has been even
greater wage stagnation than in the more highly educated
middle class (Wilkie, 1991). The greater prevalence of
earlier marriage and childbearing in the working class (Op-
penheimer, 1981) discourages educational attainment (Plot-
nick, 1992); at the same time, there has been a decrease in
high-wagejobs for people with less than a college education,
particularly those living in less affluent communities (Blue-
stone and Harrison, 1982; Wilson, 1987). Consequently,
working-class parents may be less effective in finding stable
local employment for their children than was the case 20 to
30 years ago (Biblarz, Bengtson, and Bucur, 1996). These
changing family constraints may cause working-class youth
to settle for low-wage jobs in their communities; to remain in
the parental home where, in some cases, they may attempt to
pursue an expensive college education; or to seek a better-
paying job in another locale. Apart from job constraints,
rising real estate prices may eventually necessitate a more
distant move from parents than in the past (Rubin, 1994).
Such changes suggest that working-class adults will accu-
mulate few resources by middle age (Rossides, 1990), and
thus will find it difficult to move closer to parents when the
needs of the latter change. The changing family constraints
model therefore suggests that there will not be a strong
relationship between social class and geographic distance
from parents.
Intergenerational Contact and Social Class
Frequent intergenerational contact is closely linked with
the need for social support (Hogan, Eggebeen, and Clogg,
1993; Krause and Borawski-Clark, 1995). Enduring com-
mitments to family members, however, also appear to
strongly influence the frequency of contact between adult
children and their parents, independently of social support
needs (Bengtson, Olander, and Haddad, 1976; Crimmins
and Ingegneri, 1990; Kulis, 1991; Litwak, 1985; Silver-
stein, Parrott, and Bengtson, 1995; Whitbeck, Hoyt, and
Huck, 1994). In particular, gender, marital status, number
of siblings, and number of children indicate stable family
roles that reflect long-term commitments, and also affect
contact frequency (Bengtson, Rosenthal, and Burton, 1990;
Cooney and Uhlenberg, 1990; Komarovsky, 1967; Uhlen-
berg and Cooney, 1990; Waite and Harrison, 1992).
The relative salience of needs, versus commitments, as
determinants of contact depends partly on having sufficient
resources to allow greater contact when desired, and also on
life-style characteristics (Litwak, 1960a). According to the
modified extended family model, technology such as the
telephone and rapid means of transportation allows frequent
intergenerational contact, even at great geographic dis-
tances. This suggests that middle-class adults, who live
farther away from parents but can afford to use this technol-
ogy, need not have less contact with parents than do
working-class adults. What more clearly differs between
social classes, according to this model, is the type of in-
tergenerational contact most often used.
Middle-class life styles usually involve considerable in-
person contact with friends and relatives other than immedi-
ate kin, which may substitute for in-person contact with
these kin (Fischer, 1982; Krause and Borawski-Clark, 1995;
Litwak, 1960a). Incumbency in middle-class occupations,
however, typically requires a high standard of living (e.g.,
purchase of a home). Thus, well into adulthood, middle-
class children may require transfers of money from their
parents (e.g., a down payment on a home), which parents
can typically afford; children also may need emotional
support during the early stages of a career (Litwak, 1960a).
Both transfers of money and emotional support are easily
arranged by telephone (Silverstein and Litwak, 1993).
Later, when the income and health of aging middle-class
parents begin to decline, they are more likely than those in
the working class to use purchased services or those pro-
vided by friends and relatives other than their children
(Litwak, 1985). Thus, the telephone may still be a means of
frequent contact with children at this life-course stage, but
contact will tend to be based more on parents' needs than it
previously was (Litwak, 1985). Both parents and children,
however, will probably have sufficient resources at both of
these life-course stages so that long-term family roles and
commitments will influence contact independently of needs.
In contrast, because of their earlier move to independence
(Oppenheimer, 1981), working-class young adults may not
require the prolonged financial transfers from parents that
those in the middle class do. They may have other social
support needs, however, such as child care that would
facilitate the employment of working-class wives. Working-
class adults, compared to those in the middle class, rely
more on close kin for such services (Krause and Borawski-
Clark, 1995; Litwak, 1960a, 1985). For this reason, and also
S16 GREENWELL AND BENGTSON
to actualize long-term family commitments, working-class
adult children may have frequent in-person contact with their
parents. Frequent telephone contact may also be conducted,
partly to arrange in-person visits.
In working-class occupations, earnings tend to reach their
peak during middle age; after this time, however, income
may decline due to stagnating earnings or early retirement
(Oppenheimer, 1981). Consequently, aging working-class
parents may be more likely than middle-class parents to
require frequent assistance with services that otherwise
would have to be purchased. Such assistance often requires
in-person contact. Due to the close correspondence over the
working-class life course between earnings peaks in one
generation and greater needs in the other, however, scarce
resources are not likely to limit intergenerational communi-
cation once children attain adulthood. Thus, as in the middle
class, long-term family roles and commitments should in-
fluence contact independently of needs, despite the transi-
tion over time from children's to parents' needs as determi-
nants of contact.
The changingfamily constraints model, in contrast to the
above scenario, suggests that in both social classes, limited
resources and changing life styles will increase the effects of
needs compared to commitments, and the effects of middle-
aged children's needs compared to parents', on intergenera-
tional contact frequency. Again, however, these constraints
may be more easily adjusted to in the middle than in the
working class. Indeed, there has been considerable financial
success in the upper socioeconomic strata of the baby boom
cohort (Easterlin, Macunovich, and Crimmins, 1993). It is,
however, likely that the careers of many middle-class baby
boomers have gotten off to slow starts due to stagnating
wages and the decreasing availability of stable jobs (Mar-
shall, 1995; O'Rand, 1996). High rates of divorce in this
cohort may also delay financial independence (DaVanzo and
Goldscheider, 1990). Consequently, even in middle age,
children's needs may still prevail as determinants of in-
tergenerational contact.
Nevertheless, contact may still be frequent, especially
since middle-class adult children and their parents are not
likely to have substantial conflicts over life-style differ-
ences. It seems evident that changes in family and gender-
role attitudes have occurred since the 1960s (Bane and
Ellwood, 1994; Thornton, 1989). These changes, however,
relate to life-style issues on which middle-class parents and
their children may not clearly disagree (Gordon, 1978;
Rubin, 1994).
In the working class, deferral of careers among young
adults means that they may not have reached the peak of their
earnings by the time the needs of their aging parents begin to
increase. Also, unlike in the middle class, delayed careers
will probably not lead to post-middle-aged prosperity; in-
deed, income inequality is greater in the baby boom cohort
than in their parents' cohort (Easterlin, Macunovich, and
Crimmins, 1993). Additionally, if working-class children
live farther from their parents than in the past, they may have
less frequent in-person and telephone contact with them
(Crimmins and Ingegneri, 1990; Frankel and DeWit, 1989).
When contact does occur, it is likely to result from children's
needs as much as from parents' needs. Divorce, for instance,
is likely to increase children's needs, and while it has
stabilized in the middle class, divorce continues to increase
among those with low education levels (Bumpass and Raley,
1992).
The resources that parents can make available to children
are less plentiful in the working class than in the middle
class, however. Moreover, the changes in family life styles
and values that have occurred in the past 30 years may create
conflict between middle-aged children and their parents in
the working class, since family values tend to be more
traditional in this social class than in the middle class (Kulis,
1991; Rubin, 1994). Both scarcity of resources and conflicts
over life-style differences may thus reduce the frequency of
intergenerational contact in the working class, relative to
that in the middle class.
Hypotheses
The previous discussion of the modified extended family
model implies that, despite different means to individual
achievement and needs for family support in the middle and
working classes, families in both social classes will be able to
attain sufficient resources over the life course to fulfill long-
standing commitments to their adult children and parents.
Based on that model, we propose the following hypotheses:
(la) Middle-class children will, in middle age, live far-
ther away from their parents than those in the working class,
and will have less frequent in-person contact with them,
though they will have a similar level of telephone contact.
These relationships will be found with both early and current
measures of social class, and measures of both parents' and
children's social class.
(lb) Among middle-aged children, geographic proximity
and contact frequency with parents will be positively in-
fluenced by both parents' and children's needs, indepen-
dently of the effect of distance on contact. Long-term family
roles and commitments will also be significant determinants
of contact.
The changingfamily constraints model, by contrast, em-
phasizes changes in work and family life in the past two to
three decades that appear to have disproportionately affected
the working class. Based on this model, we propose the
following alternative hypotheses:
(2a) Social class will be unrelated to geographic distance
or in-person contact frequency between middle-aged chil-
dren and their parents. Telephone contact will be more
frequent in the middle than in the working class.
(2b) Geographic proximity and both forms of contact
frequency will be positively influenced more by children's
than by parents' needs, and contact will be less strongly
related to long-term family roles and commitments than to
needs. These relationships will be found with both early and
current measures of social class, and measures of parents'
and children's social class.
The Relationship Between Geographic Distance
and Contact Frequency
The previous discussion has assumed that geographic
distance between generations results, in large part, from
SOCIAL CLASS, DISTANCE, AND CONTACT S17
long-term plans for socioeconomic attainment, which are
nevertheless sanctioned by long-term intergenerational com-
mitments. This assumption is generally supported by pre-
vious findings on migrants within the U.S. (Litwak, 1960b;
Tilly and Brown, 1967); by evidence from other societies
suggesting that migration decisions are based on plans for
long-term exchanges between parents and adult children
(Stark and Lucas, 1988); and by literature on adaptive family
strategies (Moen and Wethington, 1992; Oppenheimer,
1981). Plans for socioeconomic attainment, however, are
not likely to directly affect frequency of contact at a later
point in time. Rather, this relationship is likely to be indi-
rect, occurring through the effects of distance on contact.
Contact, instead, appears to be more directly affected than is
distance by long-term family roles and commitments (Crim-
mins and Ingegneri, 1990), which are likely to manifest
themselves when future needs arise.
These assumptions imply that early social class and early
family commitments are important influences on later geo-
graphic distance and contact frequency between generations.
Generally, however, these early factors have not been taken
into account previously by researchers. Rather, based on the
increase in the temporal and monetary costs of contact
accompanying greater geographic distance, researchers have
assumed that distance is determined prior to and indepen-
dently of contact, and hence, that distance is an exogenous
determinant of contact (DeWit, Wister, and Burch, 1988;
Frankel and DeWit, 1989; Hoyert, 1991; Kivett and Atkin-
son, 1984; Spitze and Logan, 1990a; Waite and Harrison,
1992).
Empirical findings based on this assumption of exogeneity
consistently show that geographic distance is one of the
strongest predictors of in-person or telephone contact. Find-
ings on the relationship between social class and contact are
not as consistent, however. Some researchers find that
middle-class individuals -- those with more education or
higher income -- have less frequent intergenerational con-
tact than others (Crimmins and Ingegneri, 1990; Lawton,
Silverstein, and Bengtson, 1994; Spitze and Logan, 1990a).
Other researchers find the opposite (Kivett and Atkinson,
1984; Uhlenberg and Cooney, 1990; Waite and Harrison,
1992). Still others find that the relationship between income
and geographic distance accounts entirely for that between
income and contact (DeWit, Wister, and Burch, 1988;
Frankel and DeWit, 1989). The discrepancies among these
findings may be partly due to the use of measures that do not
distinguish in-person from telephone contact (e.g., Kivett
and Atkinson, 1984; Waite and Harrison, 1992). However,
these discrepancies, and the strength of the estimated effect
of distance on contact, may also be partly due to the assump-
tion that distance is exogenous to contact.
In contrast to this assumption, our argument that early
social class and long-term commitments affect both distance
and contact implies that distance and contact are endoge-
nous, as suggested by Wolf (1994). Such endogeneity would
produce a correlation between the error terms of the separate
models used to predict distance and contact, and thus may
bias the estimated coefficients. In a regression model, bias
due to endogeneity is likely, at minimum, to inflate the
estimated effect of distance on contact; it may also affect the
sizes of other estimated effects in the model. Consequently,
in the analyses reported below, we use statistical techniques
that adjust for the possibility of endogeneity bias.
METHODS
Sample
The data analyzed are from the University of Southern
California Longitudinal Study of Generations and Mental
Health (LSOG). LSOG sample members were selected ran-
domly in 1971 from grandfathers aged 55 years and over
who were members of an 840,000-member Southern Cali-
fornia health maintenance organization, had a living child,
and had a grandchild between ages 16 and 26 (Bengtson,
1975). Respondents were surveyed by mail in 1971. In more
than 300 families, members of all three generations re-
sponded, producing a baseline sample of 2,044 individuals.
Respondents were followed up in 1985, 1988, 1991, and
1994. The sample overrepresents White middle- and
working-class people in the Los Angeles area (Silverstein
and Bengtson, 1991) and their descendants, partly because
many of the grandfathers were enrolled in the health plan as
labor union members during the 1950s and 1960s.
The sample for analysis is restricted in four ways. First,
we analyze only non-coresident parent and child dyads (the
children [G2s] and grandchildren [G3s] of the original sam-
ple members) in order to focus exclusively on middle-aged
children and their parents who do not share households.
Second, in accord with the longitudinal analyses, the sample
only contains children who responded both in 1971 and 1991
and who, at both of these time points, were "study chil-
dren" -- the first child in each family to complete the 1971
survey, and the referent of the parent's responses. Third, to
minimize the effects of unobserved, family-specific factors,
one parent per child is randomly chosen to form a single
dyad for each family. Parents who are siblings, however, are
included along with their study children who are first cous-
ins. Fourth, individuals are excluded from the analyses when
they have missing values on the dependent variables. These
restrictions produce a sample of 161 parent-child dyads.
Measures
We describe in this section the variables that were initially
included in the analytic models. However, due to sample
size limitations, we retain only the most substantively im-
portant or significant variables in the final models. These are
presented in Table 1; procedures used to select variables for
the final models are described below.
Dependent variables: geographic distance and contact
frequency. -- Measures of distance are dichotomized to
indicate whether adult children and parents live more than
50 miles apart. This distance roughly corresponds to an
hour of transportation time, which is a commonly used
measure (e.g., DeJong et al., 1995; Silverstein, 1995). At
this distance, frequent visits are possible without requiring
an overnight stay; thus, 50 miles may represent a threshold
(Frankel and DeWit, 1989) beyond which frequent contact
begins to become prohibitively costly. Since contact is
measured only at the ordinal level in the LSOG, measures

·Numbers of cases for children's reports differ from those for parents' reports due to differing numbers of missing values on these variables.
bUnless otherwise noted, independent variables referring to parents are reported by parents; others refer to children and are reported by them.
of in-person and telephone contact are dichotomized to
indicate having at least weekly contact. Dichotomizing
distance and contact measures minimizes the effects of
extreme values, which can distort results, and also produces
categories with fairly evenly-split numbers of cases, keep-
ing cell sizes relatively high.
Social class and economic resources. -- Following
Litwak (1960a, 1960b), occupation is used as the primary
indicator of middle-aged children's current social class posi-
tion. If either children or their spouses are in a blue-collar or
service occupation, they are categorized as being from a
working-class family; all others are categorized as middle
class. Included in the middle-class category are a very few
cases where neither spouse reported an occupation; forming
a separate category from these cases did not change the
results. Also initially included was an analogous measure of
father's occupation when the child was a teenager, in which
the few farmers were classified as working-class individuals.
Too few parents were working in 1991 to include a measure
of their current occupation.
Income is another indicator of social class position, espe-
cially for retired parents, but also represents an economic
resource that strongly constrains changes in distance and
contact frequency. Dichotomous measures of family income
are used. These represent families having less than $13,000
in 1971 (adjusted with the CPI-U-X1, about $30,000 in
1982-1984 dollars); parents having less than $30,000 in
1991 (about $22,000 in 1982-1984 dollars); and children
having less than $60,000 in 1991 (about $44,000 in 1982-
1984 dollars). These categories were chosen partly to obtain
adequate cell sizes; trichotomies were initially used, but
their use did not change the results.
Education is a third measure of social class, which also
indicates economic and social resources. We initially used
several measures of education in each generation, but re-
tained only children's 1971 reports of their fathers' educa-
tion (dichotomized to indicate having more than a high
school education). Additionally, we included a measure of
children's 1971 educational aspirations, dichotomized to
indicate aspiring to less than a college education; when
children reported having finished school by 1971, their
educational aspirations were coded as the level of education
they had completed. Adolescents' educational aspirations
help to explain major life-course decisions (Plotnick, 1992),
and may also reflect family members' consensus about the
affordability and necessity of children's occupational and
geographic mobility (Litwak, 1960b).
Family roles and commitments. -- We included several
measures of parents' and children's family roles in initial
models: gender; marital status; previous experience of di-
vorce; number of children; whether children lived with
parents year-round in 1971 (this would have determined
geographic distance and influenced contact frequency at that
time); whether children lived in Southern California (i.e.,
near grandparents) in 1971; and whether an older extended
family member lived with parents' or children's families
SOCIAL CLASS, DISTANCE, AND CONTACT S19
when they were growing up. We selectively included three
measures of family commitments: children's measures of
1971 affectual and normative solidarity (Bengtson and
Roberts, 1991); and whether children identified themselves
as Catholic in 1971.
Noneconomic needs and resources. -- Three measures of
health needs were initially used: self-reported health com-
pared to others one's age; number of chronic conditions; and
age in years. A strong ethnic identification may also encour-
age proximity to parents (Angel and Tienda, 1982; Litwak,
1960a, 1985), particularly since it may measure limited
access to institutional resources. The ethnicity measure indi-
cates whether respondents identified themselves as White in
1971.
Data Analysis
To analyze distance and contact, we estimate simultane-
ous probit models with LIMDEP Version 6.0 (Greene,
1992). Simultaneous probit is a dichotomous dependent
variable analogue to two-stage least squares. This technique
is appropriate given our assumption that long-term family
plans, based on both social class and family commitments,
jointly determine distance and contact. Specifically, because
family plans are not directly measured, we assume that the
error terms of the models for distance and contact are
correlated; this necessitates their simultaneous estimation
(Greene, 1993, p. 596; Pindyck and Rubinfeld, 1991, p.
298). Because we assume that, when measured at the same
point in time, distance affects contact but not the reverse, we
use a recursive model, rather than a nonrecursive one in
which contact would also cause distance.
In the first stage of this two-stage technique, a reduced
form model is estimated in order to construct predicted
values of distance. These are independent of the error terms
in both the distance and contact models, and therefore can be
included in the second-stage model of contact without risk of
endogeneity bias. The standard errors of the second-stage
estimates are adjusted using the procedure described by
Maddala (1983, pp. 246-247).
To identify the model of contact, we include in the model
of distance the child's 1971 educational aspirations and 1971
report of their father's education. These indicate, respec-
tively, children's plans for socioeconomic attainment, and
parents' plans for their own and their children's attainments.
These variables are assumed to directly affect later distance
from parents, but only to affect later contact frequency
indirectly, through their effects on distance.
Sample means are substituted for missing values on ex-
planatory variables. Because of sample size limitations,
initial specifications included only incomes of both genera-
tions and educational aspirations in the model of distance;
and incomes and predicted distance in the model of contact.
Control variables were included in final models only if they
approached statistical significance when added, one by one,
to these minimal models, and either remained near statistical
significance once other variables were included or were
substantively important. To assess whether long-term family
commitments accounted for any social class effects we
observed, measures of affectual and normative solidarity
were added, one at a time, only to final models.
Sample selection biases. -- To account for possible biases
due to attrition and to the method of selecting the longitudi-
nal analysis sample, models adjusting for the effects on
distance and contact of selection into the sample are esti-
mated. Previous studies have found that retention in longitu-
dinal surveys is related to higher socioeconomic status and to
nonminority status (Kalton et al., 1990; Streib, 1966). Also,
having greater family commitment may affect retention, as
might the fact that multiple households in the same families
are surveyed (Lillard, 1989, discusses an analogous effect
among members of the same household).
To analyze the determinants of selection into the analysis
sample, we randomly chose one child from every family that
did not get included in the analysis sample, but did have a
child responding in 1971. There are 285 such children,
resulting in a total of 446 children in the selection analysis
when combined with the 161 in the analysis sample. Of these
285 children, 29% refused to participate sometime between
1971 and 1991; 27% could not be located in 1991; 12% died,
were incapacitated, or were dropped due to an inadequate
family response pattern; and 32% participated. The partici-
pants presumably either were not study children, or could
not be matched with a participating parent.
Bivariate probit models are used to analyze selection into
the analysis sample. This technique is a dichotomous depen-
dent variable analogue to seemingly unrelated regression. It
is used when there is no joint determination of two outcomes
(e.g., selection does not cause distance in 1991, nor does
distance cause selection), but there are common unobserved
causes of both outcomes that produce a correlation in resid-
uals of the two models predicting them. The technique can
be used to determine whether analyses of distance or contact
are affected by the nonrandom selection of observations
from a larger sample (Greene, 1993).
The predictors of distance and contact are identical to
those used in the simultaneous probit models, except the
contact models do not control for distance. This is because
the analysis of a simultaneous probit within a bivariate probit
model would entail dubious statistical assumptions (William
Greene, personal communication, July 10, 1995). Although
selection models of contact that do not control for distance
are subject to omitted variable bias, they do provide some
indication of how much the size and significance of coef-
ficients are likely to change due to selection effects.
The intergenerational stake bias. -- Bengtson and Kuy-
pers (1971) suggested that parents have more of a stake than
do their children in believing that they are emotionally close
to each other. This reasoning may also apply to geographic
distance and contact, which are also forms of closeness
between generations. Accordingly, parents' and children's
reports of distance and contact, and the models predicting
these, may differ according to their different experiences and
investments in their mutual relationship. Therefore, we
analyze both parents' and children's reports of distance and
contact. Our primary substantive interest, however, is in
parents' perceptions of the availability of children to them.
S20 GREENWELL AND BENGTSON
RESULTS
Table 1 provides information on mean levels of geo-
graphic distance and contact between the middle-aged chil-
dren and parents in our sample. Consistent with the in-
tergenerational stake hypothesis (Bengtson and Kuypers,
1971; Giarrusso, Stallings, and Bengtson, 1995), parents
perceive more contact with their children than the children
do with them. While 28 percent of the parents report weekly
in-person contact, only 18 percent of the children do; 53
percent of the parents report weekly telephone contact,
compared to only 42 percent of the children. Both of these
differences are statistically significant (p < .05).
To further elaborate the descriptive findings, tabulations
showing the interrelations between social class, distance or
contact, and gender are briefly discussed (not shown). These
indicate that working-class adult children are more likely to
live within 50 miles of their parents (p < .10) and to have in-
person contact with parents at least weekly (p < .10) than are
those in the middle class. There is no significant social class
difference in the frequency of telephone contact. In the
bivariate tabulations, women are more likely than men to
engage in weekly in-person contact with their parents (p <
.05), but there are no significant gender differences in either
geographic distance or telephone contact. These findings all
are consistent with the modified extended family hypothesis.
It should be noted that there is greater geographic distance
between generations in the LSOG analysis sample than in
nationally representative data. While 56 percent of the adult
children in our sample live more than 50 miles from their
parents, only about 40 percent of adult children in a nation-
ally representative sample live more than an hour from their
parents (Lawton, Silverstein, and Bengtson, 1994), which is
a roughly comparable distance. Findings from the National
Survey of Families and Households show that adult children
live about 35 miles, on average, from their parents (the
antilog of the mean natural log reported by Hogan, Egge-
been, and Clogg, 1993), while in our analysis sample, the
comparable figure is about 70 miles. It should also be noted
that, consistent with these greater distances, the intergenera-
tional dyads in our sample appear to have somewhat less
contact than in other studies; 56 percent of the parents
reported any type of contact weekly, compared to 69 percent
in a nationally representative sample (Lawton, Silverstein,
and Bengtson, 1994).
Multivariate Analyses of Geographic Distance
and Contact
This section reports results of multivariate analyses that
test the modified extended family hypotheses (la and lb)
against the alternative changing family constraints hypothe-
ses (2a and 2b). Models include measures of early social
class position, current social class position, and family roles
and commitments; initial models included measures of both
parents' and children's needs. Due to sample size limita-
tions, the final models contain only statistically significant or
substantively important variables; other findings, not shown,
are discussed when they are relevant to the hypotheses.
Geographic distance and in-person contact. -- The modi-
fied extended family model predicts that working-class,
middle-aged children and their parents will live closer to
each other and have more frequent in-person contact than
those in the middle class (hypothesis la). Table 2 shows that
this hypothesis is supported, but only by the effects of early
social class measures. The analysis of distance (Model 1 in
Table 2) shows that middle-aged children who, in 1971, had
lower educational aspirations and less highly educated fa-
thers lived closer to their parents in 1991 than did others.
These findings indicate that the linkage between early plans
for attainment and later distance from parents not only
endures over time, but also appears to be stronger than the
linkage between current attainments and distance. While
Model 1 shows that adult children currently in the working
class live closer to their parents than those in the middle
class, this finding is not statistically significant. Parent's
previous occupation also is not significant in this model (not
shown).
Though unanticipated, the dominance of early, compared
to later, social class effects on distance is consistent with the
modified extended family hypothesis. The dominance of
these effects may suggest that, despite changing family
constraints, early plans for attainment have been carried out
while also taking into account the needs of other family
members. Moreover, to the extent that early educational
aspirations proxy for later occupational mobility, their ef-
fects on distance are entirely consistent with the modified
extended family model (Litwak, 1960a).
Early social class effects are also revealed by Model 2 of
Table 2, which shows that parents who had lower income in
1971 have more frequent in-person contact with middle-
aged children in 1991 than did those who had higher income.
This finding implies that early parental disadvantage affects
later contact with children independently of plans for attain-
ment. Thus, this finding also supports the modified extended
family hypothesis (la).
Hypothesis lb states that long-term family commitments
will affect distance and contact independently of social class
position, as will both parents' and children's needs when
children are middle-aged. Some support for this hypothesis
is found in Model 2 of Table 2. When parents have a greater
number of children, the children in the analysis sample are
less likely to be in frequent contact with them (p < . 10). This
implies that adult siblings coordinate their in-person contacts
to ensure that parents have potential support available
(Uhlenberg and Cooney, 1990; Waite and Harrison, 1992).
Women are also more likely to be in frequent in-person
contact with their parents, suggesting some influence of a
kin-keeping role (Bengtson, Rosenthal, and Burton, 1990;
Komarovsky, 1967). Controlling for the child's marital
status does not change this finding (data not shown), as
research on coresidence suggests that it might (Crimmins
and Ingegneri, 1990; Wolf and Soldo, 1988). Contrary to
hypothesis lb, however, neither parents' nor children's
noneconomic needs affect distance or in-person contact (not
shown).
As expected, early plans for socioeconomic attainment
appear to have no direct effects on later in-person contact,
but may have indirect effects through distance. Distance is
strongly and negatively related to in-person contact, even
after the endogeneity of distance and contact is accounted for

(Table 2, Model 2). But the size of the estimated effect of
distance, although the largest among all the variables in the
model, is only about one-third of what it is in the model
without the adjustment for endogeneity (not shown). More-
over, compared to this model, the estimated effects of other
variables in Model 2 of Table 2 are generally smaller and
have different significance levels. These findings imply that
it is essential to jointly analyze in-person contact with
geographic distance if its relationships with other factors are
to be accurately estimated.
In contrast to the findings discussed thus far, the models
displayed in Table 2 also provide support for the changing
family constraints hypothesis (2a). Based on the assumption
that working-class people will have difficulty maintaining
geographic proximity between generations, this hypothesis
predicts that geographic distance and in-person contact will
be unrelated to social class. The findings, however, provide
even stronger support for this hypothesis. Parents with low
income in 1991 report living farther away from their chil-
dren than those with higher income. This finding could
represent an effect of children moving far from home due to
job constraints or rising real estate prices (particularly
among Southern California residents [Rubin, 1994], who are
disproportionately represented in this sample); alternatively,
it may represent the effect of parents moving to areas with
low costs of living (DeJong et al., 1995), where there are
few jobs available to their adult children. The finding never-
theless suggests that parents in the greatest financial need
may have the least-available children.
The several effects of long-term family roles on in-person
contact, discussed previously, contravene the changing fam-
ily constraints hypothesis (2b). This hypothesis, however,
also predicts that parents' needs will be less important than
those of children in determining distance and in-person
contact. Thus, it is consistent with hypothesis 2b that par-
ents' noneconomic needs have no significant effects on in-
person contact or distance, despite the fact that children's
needs also have no such effects (not shown).
Geographic distance and telephone contact. -- The mod-
ified extended family hypothesis (la) predicts that there
will be no social class difference in the frequency of tele-
phone contact, whereas the changing family constraints
hypothesis (2a) predicts that this form of contact will be
more frequent in the middle than in the working class. The
findings for telephone contact in Model 2 of Table 3 provide
unexpectedly strong support for hypothesis la. Working-
class children are more likely than middle-class children to
be in weekly telephone contact with their parents (p < .10).
The difference of 16 percentage points between social
classes in the predicted probability of frequent telephone
contact indicates that resource limitations and life-style con-
flicts have not discouraged frequent parental telephone con-
tact with working-class children. This effect does not appear
to be due to children's economic needs, since their income is
controlled in the model. It thus may represent effects of
family commitments specific to the working class. Indeed,
when a measure of the child's 1971 affectual solidarity with
the mother is added to this model, the effect of being in a
working-class family drops from .48 to .41 and becomes in-

significant (not shown). This is consistent with the findings
of Kulis (1991) that working-class adult children express
unqualified affection for their parents more frequently than
those in the middle class, and also have more frequent
telephone contact with them.
Further support is provided for the modified extended
family hypothesis (lb) by findings indicating that family
roles and commitments affect contact more than do needs.
Mothers are more likely than fathers to report having weekly
telephone contact with their children, suggesting effects of a
kin-keeper role that is more often found among women
(Bengtson, Rosenthal, and Burton, 1990; Komarovsky,
1967). Children who, in 1971, reported being Catholic are
also more likely than others to have weekly telephone
contact. This may be an effect of family commitment;
alternatively, however, Catholicism in urban areas may also
predict more general social involvement (Fischer, 1982).
Additionally, parents with more children have less frequent
weekly telephone contact with the child in the sample than
do those with fewer children. This, like the similar finding
for in-person contact, suggests a division of labor among
several children in keeping contact with parents. Though
neither parents' nor children's noneconomic needs signifi-
cantly predict telephone contact, the estimated effect of
parent's age is positive, in keeping with hypothesis lb.
Consistent with the modified extended family hypothesis
(la), telephone contact is not affected by distance, suggest-
ing that the greater costs imposed by greater distance are not
prohibitive of such contact. Without adjusting for endoge-
neity, the effect of distance on telephone contact is far larger
and highly significant (not shown), which would be consist-
ent with the changing family constraints hypothesis. Adjust-
ing for endogeneity also changes several other estimated
effects in this model and their significance levels.
Support for the changing family constraints hypothesis
(2a), however, is also provided by Table 3. Parents with
lower 1991 income report less frequent telephone contact
with their children than do those with higher income (p <
.10). This finding implies that parents with greater economic
needs do not have frequent telephone contact with their adult
child, suggesting that such parents may not be receiving
needed social support. The fact that there are few discernible
effects, and no significant effects, of parents' noneconomic
needs on telephone contact provides further support for this
interpretation.
Analyses of potential bias: selection into the sample and
children's reports. -- We thought it necessary to test for
several sources of potential bias in the analyses. First, we
examined whether nonrandom selection into the analysis
sample affected the analyses of geographic distance and each
type of contact. The selection analyses (which are available
upon request) were based upon the 161 dyads in the analysis
sample plus 285 additional cases that were excluded from
this sample, as previously discussed. It is important to note
that the sample selection model has significant predictors
that identify the models of distance and contact; this purpose
is served in the model of distance by the variable indicating
SOCIAL CLASS, DISTANCE, AND CONTACT S23
Catholicism, and in both models of contact by the variable
indicating having had a highly educated father. This gives us
confidence that the models adequately represent the effects
of selection. Due to statistical considerations noted above,
distance is not included in the selection models of contact.
When the model of distance is adjusted for selection, the
effects of being White and father's education are reduced to
insignificance, and the effects of parents' 1991 income and
educational aspirations become less significant. The correla-
tion between the unobserved predictors of distance and
selection (-.50), however, is insignificant. This implies that
no unobserved factors significantly relate selection to dis-
tance (Kuate Defo, 1992).
The unobserved factors predicting selection are, by con-
trast, significantly correlated with those affecting both types
of contact. For in-person contact, this correlation is .98 and
is significant at/? < .001. This positive correlation could, for
example, indicate having greater commitments to one's
family, which might increase the chances both of participat-
ing in the survey and of having more frequent in-person
contact with parents. Geographic proximity, not included in
this model, might have similar effects. Despite the signifi-
cant correlation, however, other estimated effects in this
model are not changed a great deal by adjusting for selec-
tion. Generally, the sizes of the effects are smaller, and their
significance levels differ slightly from those of the model not
adjusted for selection.
The correlation between the unobserved predictors of
telephone contact is -.74 and is significant at p < .05.
Factors such as unobserved needs that are communicated by
telephone but also constrain participation in the study may
lead to this negative correlation. Adjusting for selection has
a greater impact on the model of telephone contact than on
that of in-person contact. The estimated effects of all varia-
bles are reduced, in some cases, by about a third of their
original size. The effects of parent's 1991 income, and of
being Catholic, no longer significantly predict telephone
contact in this model; also, the significance-of the effect of
children's working-class status is reduced.
A second possible source of bias is the inclusion in the
analysis sample only of children who were selected as
"study children." These children were the first to return
their 1971 questionnaires. Since more rapid response may
indicate greater family commitments, we conducted f-tests
of several indicators of family roles and commitments,
comparing these children with others. There were no signifi-
cant differences between the two groups of children in these
analyses.
Third, we examined possible biases resulting from the use
of parents', rather than children's, reports of distance and
contact; as Table 1 indicates, children report less frequent
contact with their parents than parents do with those same
children (the intergenerational stake phenomenon). Speci-
fically, we estimated models of children's reports of distance
and contact using the same variables as those in the models
of parents' reports. Findings from these analyses show that
the predictors of children's reports do not differ markedly
from those of parents' reports (analyses are available upon
request). The findings for geographic distance change only
slightly when children's reports are analyzed. In the analysis
of in-person contact reported by children, the effect of
gender becomes insignificant and much smaller than in the
analysis of parents' reports. Other estimates change only
slightly in significance level; these changes do not affect our
substantive conclusions. In the analysis of telephone contact
reported by children, however, the negative effect of dis-
tance increases to--.493 and becomes significant (p < .05).
The effects of being in a working-class family, of having
parents with low income, of being Catholic, and of number
of siblings become less significant or insignificant. These
findings suggest that the cost constraints of distance become
more salient in children's perceptions of contact, and that
these constraints account for the effects of current social
class position, and of family roles and commitments, on
telephone contact.
In sum, accounting for possible biases produces very few
changes in the results. When selection is accounted for, the
effects of early social class on distance become somewhat
less pronounced, and the effect of parents' 1991 income on
telephone contact becomes insignificant. When children's
reports of distance and contact are analyzed, gender no
longer has a significant effect on in-person contact, and the
effect of distance on telephone contact becomes significant
while the effects of social class on telephone contact become
insignificant.
DISCUSSION
In his landmark research, Litwak (1960a) predicted that
the modified extended family, typified by relatively great
distance but fairly frequent contact between adult children
and their aging parents, would continue to be the dominant
model for middle-class and occupationally mobile individ-
uals in the U.S. He also argued that the traditional extended
family, typified by close geographic proximity and frequent
contact between generations, was more characteristic of the
working class. This research investigated whether such so-
cial class differences in distance and contact between
middle-aged children and their parents persisted between
1971 and 1991, or how, alternatively, they might have
changed in response to social-structural changes in work and
family life during that period.
The Modified Extended Family Model
The findings provide considerable support for the mod-
ified extended family model, but only when the effects of
early, rather than current, measures of social class are
considered. In particular, middle-aged children who, in
1991, lived at a greater geographic distance from parents or
had less frequent in-person contact with them were more
likely than others to have had parents with higher education
or income in 1971, or to have themselves had high 1971
educational aspirations. These results also provide strong
empirical support for the assumption that early plans for
socioeconomic attainment have enduring direct effects on
geographic distance between adult children and their par-
ents, but only affect contact indirectly.
Also consistent with the modified extended family hy-
potheses are findings suggesting that enduring family roles
and commitments (represented by being female, number of
children, Catholicism, and early affectual solidarity with
S24 GREENWELL AND BENGTSON
one's mother) affect both in-person and telephone contact
between adult generations. These results show that needs are
not the sole determinants of contact with parents. Yet, by the
same token, they also suggest that those who had weaker
intergenerational solidarity or weaker family commitments
20 years earlier may have trouble obtaining social support as
their needs increase with age. Such an inference is supported
by other recent studies (Cooney and Uhlenberg, 1990;
Silverstein, Parrott, and Bengtson, 1995; Whitbeck, Hoyt,
and Huck, 1994).
The Changing Family Constraints Model
The changing family constraints model predicts that inten-
tions to adjust intergenerational distance and contact have
been constrained by increased economic instability and fam-
ily disruption, particularly among middle-aged children in
the working class. Support for this hypothesis is provided
primarily by findings for parents' current, rather than past,
measures of social class and needs. Parents with low in-
comes in 1991 live farther away from their middle-aged
children than those with higher incomes, and also have less
telephone contact with them (though the latter finding may
be an artifact of sample selection). Furthermore, middle-
aged children's current social class position is not signifi-
cantly related to their distance from their parents.
These findings indicate that the potential for social support
among aging parents represented by close geographic prox-
imity and frequent telephone contact is limited by their low
income. The findings may represent the effects of a decline
in the availability of stable working-class jobs in less affluent
communities (Bluestone and Harrison, 1982; Wilson, 1987);
a greater availability of such jobs would have better enabled
the children of lower-income parents to live close to them.
The findings may also reflect the inability of parents to reside
in higher cost-of-living areas where their children are work-
ing (DeJong et al., 1995). Both of these interpretations
imply that parents with greater financial needs may not
receive needed social support. A possible alternative inter-
pretation, however, is that more affluent parents are more
able to "purchase" proximity to and contact with their
children (Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers, 1985). Indeed,
since the average age of the parents in this sample is less than
65 years, many of them may not have disabling conditions
requiring children's geographic proximity.
Overall, the findings support Wolf's (1994) contention
that distance and contact between adult generations are
jointly determined. Adjusting for this endogeneity has im-
portant substantive implications. Without the adjustment for
joint determination, the findings for telephone contact re-
ported by parents would support the changing family con-
straints hypothesis; with the adjustment, they support the
modified extended family hypothesis. Most research on
distance and contact has not included measures of early
social class position or early aspirations, and therefore may
erroneously attribute a portion of the effects of early social
class to a family's current social class position or to distance
itself. Separating earlier from later effects of social class
may be especially important during a period of history when
substantial changes in family economic support have oc-
curred (Wilkie, 1991).
Three potential limitations to these findings should be
noted. First, the conceptualization of social class used in this
research emphasizes distinctions between the middle and
working classes, and emphasizes the effects of occupational
mobility. Some scholars, however, argue that a simple blue-
collar/white-collar dichotomy does not adequately reflect
social class differences (Hout, Brooks, and Manza, 1995).
Others argue that social class position is relatively perma-
nent in U.S. society; this argument has special relevance to
the life-course perspective. Substantial occupational mobil-
ity, for instance, is entirely "compatible with a high rate of
ascriptive transmission of class position from one generation
to the next" (Rossides, 1990, p. 405). The income and
occupation measures used in this research are transitory; the
education measures, while relatively stable, do not fully
reflect the enduring and cumulative effects of social class.
Second, our results are based on a sample that, while unique
in its longitudinal assessment of family solidarity among
several generations, overrepresents White, middle- and
working-class families, and families with members in Los
Angeles, compared to the national population. Because it
was drawn from the 1971 membership of a health mainte-
nance organization, the sample excludes the very wealthy
and very poor; thus, the findings may understate the relation-
ship of social class to geographic distance and contact. Very
poor adult children and parents probably would live closer to
each other than do the relatively economically stable fami-
lies in this sample. Additionally, geographic distance be-
tween generations in this research is greater than in research
based on nationally representative samples, also implying
that we are not observing the full range of the interrelations
between social class, distance, and contact. Third, the sam-
ple originally was selected from grandparents in a very
limited range of occupations -- those, for instance, whose
members had employer-provided health maintenance orga-
nization coverage in 1971. It is possible that this concentra-
tion in specific occupations resulted in intergenerational
correlations of specific factors, such as attitudes toward
educational attainment or toward family contact, that might
affect the interrelations between social class, geographic
distance, and contact frequency.
Despite these potential limitations, the findings provide
new information about the effects of social class on adult
intergenerational relationships over time. In particular, the
findings suggest the value of further research in this area
using alternative conceptualizations of social class, and of
further assessment of the adaptive strategies provided by
different intergenerational family structures. Additionally,
the two conceptual models examined here are amenable to
testing by other researchers using larger and nationally
representative samples.
In conclusion, our results show that social class position
and early aspirations affect geographic distance and contact
frequency between adult children and their parents over 20
years. The effects of early factors are consistent with the
modified extended family hypothesis. The effects of parents'
current social class position, however, tell a different story.
Parents who currently have great financial needs may have
little proximity to or contact with their middle-aged children.
These complex effects of social class suggest the need for
SOCIAL CLASS, DISTANCE, AND CONTACT S25
greater understanding of how cumulative stratification
(O'Rand, 1996) takes place, and what its effects are on the
adequacy of social support systems among the elderly.
