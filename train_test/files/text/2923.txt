Abstract
This paper investigates whether the new Basel Accord will induce a change in bank
lending to emerging markets using a comprehensive new data set on German banks`
foreign exposure. We test two interlinked hypotheses on the conditions under which the
change in the regulatory capital would leave lending flows unaffected. This would be the
case if (i) the new regulatory capital requirement remains below the economic capital and
(ii) banks' economic capital to emerging markets already adequately reflects risk. On both
accounts the evidence indicates that the new Basel Accord should have a limited effect on
lending to emerging markets.

Non-technical Summary
The new Basel Accord on capital requirements for banks (Basel II) defines regulatory
capital requirements in line with the underlying risk of lending and therefore marks a
substantial modification from previous regulation. This will raise regulatory capital
requirements for higher risk asset classes, which include the emerging markets. Higher
regulatory capital has an impact on lending flows only if regulatory capital requirements
become binding. In other words, if banks have already calculated economic capital based
on similar risk models in the past and these remain binding no further change should occur.
This paper tests these two interlinked hypothesis. We expect that lending patterns will
remain unchanged if:
(1) regulatory capital requirements remain below the economic capital and
(2) banks' lending is already based on risk modelling.
To test the first hypothesis we calculate the economic capital of the foreign portfolio of
German banks as unexpected loss using a Value at Risk model. We find that economic
capital seems to be binding.
The second condition is tested by estimating the influence of unexpected loss in explaining
lending to emerging markets. We find that unexpected loss is a significant determinant of
the banks' loan decisions, in particular for Large Banks as well as Landesbanken and in
recent years also for other banking groups. Thus, it appears that risk modelling has already
guided lending decisions.
Overall, the evidence from both tests points in the same direction and we conclude that the
new Basel Accord should have a limited effect on lending to emerging markets.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Mit Inkrafttreten der neuen Baseler Eigenmittelvereinbarung (Basel II) werden sich die
regulatorischen Eigenkapitalanforderungen, die an eine Bank gestellt werden, an den
Kreditrisiken des Portfolios orientieren. Als Konsequenz werden die regulatorischen
Eigenkapitalanforderungen für Kredite mit hohen Risiken, z. B. Kredite an
Schwellenländer, steigen. Ob diese Erhöhung eine Reduktion der Kreditvergabe zur Folge
haben wird, hängt davon ab, ob die neuen Anforderungen bindend sein werden. Keine
Änderungen in der Kreditvergabe sind zu erwarten, wenn Banken das ökonomische
Kapital bereits in der Vergangenheit auf der Grundlage ähnlicher Modelle berechnet haben
und das ökonomische Kapital auch nach der neuen Regelung bindend bleibt. Im
vorliegenden Diskussionspapier werden die Ergebnisse aus einem Test beider miteinander
verbundenen Hypothesen präsentiert. Wir erwarten keine Veränderung in der
Kreditvergabe, sofern
(1) das regulatorische Eigenkapital kleiner ist als das ökonomische Kapital der Banken
(2) und Banken die Kreditvergabe bereits auf der Basis von Risikomodellen steuern.
Die erste Bedingung wird getestet, indem das ökonomische Kapital für die Auslandsport-
folien der deutscher Banken als unerwarteter Verlust anhand eines Value-at-Risk-Modells
berechnet und anschließend mit dem regulatorischen Eigenkapital verglichen wird. Die
Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass das ökonomische Kapital bindend ist.
Zur Überprüfung der zweiten Bedingung wird der Einfluss des unerwarteten Verlusts zur
Erklärung der Kreditvergabe an Schwellenländer geschätzt. Die Ergebnisse bestätigen,
dass der unerwartete Verlust einen signifikanten Beitrag bei der Erklärung der Kreditver-
gabeentscheidungen hat. Das gilt besonders für Groß- und Landesbanken und in den
letzten Jahren auch für andere Bankengruppen. Die These, dass Banken schon in der
Vergangenheit bei der Kreditvergabe Risikomodelle herangezogen haben, wird daher
gestützt.
Zusammenfassend deuten beide Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass die Einführung des neuen
Baseler Akkords nur eine geringe Auswirkung auf die Kreditvergabe an Schwellenländer
haben wird.

How will Basel II affect bank lending to emerging markets?
An analysis based on German bank level data#

1 Introduction
Since 1999 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has been working on a revised
Capital Accord, which should align regulatory capital requirements with the actual risk
associated with banks' assets calculated with modern risk management techniques. The
new Accord will increase regulatory capital for lower rating classes and, as a consequence,
many observers feared that bank lending to emerging markets would decline.1 The aim of
this paper is to investigate this claim bringing to bear a new and comprehensive dataset of
German bank lending.
At the outset it is worth mentioning that the series of revisions of the new Accord have
already contributed to dampening fears of a large impact on lending to high risk lenders.
After the first consultative proposals for Basel II were released in June 1999 and January
2001 the Committee received a large number of responses.2 Concerns about a negative
impact on lending to lower rating categories, a characteristic shared by most small and
medium sized firms and emerging markets, lead to a reduction of these risk weights in the
subsequent revisions.3 Nevertheless, the third Quantitative Impact Study 3 (QIS 3)4
revealed that capital requirements for sovereign exposures will still rise by 28 per cent
under the Advanced IRB5 and 47 per cent under the Foundation IRB for Group 1 banks.6

4 During the development of the new capital framework, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
carried out a number of impact studies to assess the effect that it would have on banks' minimum capital. The
most extensive study, QIS 3, was carried out in 2002/2003 and the results were published in May 2003, see
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 2003a and 2003b. This included data from 365 banks from 43
countries.
5 The Committee proposes to permit banks a choice between two broad methodologies for calculating their
capital requirements for credit risk. One alternative will be to measure credit risk in a standardised manner.
Under the other alternative, banks that have received supervisory approval to use the Internal Ratings-Based
Approach (IRB) may rely on their own internal estimates of risk components in determining the capital
requirements. For many asset classes, the Committee has made available two approaches within the IRB
framework: a foundation and an advanced approach. Under the foundation approach, as a general rule, banks
provide their own estimates of probability of default (PD) and rely on supervisory estimates for other risk
components. Under the advanced approach, banks provide their own estimates of PD, loss given default
- 2 -
Given the prominent role of Group 1 banks in lending to emerging markets, this rise in
requirements might potentially lead to large adjustments in international bank lending to
emerging markets.
Furthermore, even in the absence of large changes in capital costs, Basel II might have a
significant impact on bank lending flows since small spread changes may induce large
portfolio reallocations. And, in a market characterised by credit rationing, spread increases
may lead to the exclusion of borrowers.7
Fewer possibilities for regulatory arbitrage might lead to shifts in the pattern of flows to
emerging markets. The simple categorisation under Basel I gave banks leeway for capital
arbitrage by choosing higher-risk assets within a given risk category.8 In particular, the
OECD/non-OECD distinction in principle allowed banks to hold risky assets (e.g. Mexico)
without commensurate capital. The lower risk weight for short-term lending may have
contributed to large inflows of short-term capital before the Asian crisis.9
The existing literature initially predicted very large effects of Basel II on emerging markets
spreads (see Reisen (2001), Griffith-Jones (2003)). However, this result was mainly due to
a somewhat unrealistic assumption about required rates of return for high-risk assets.
Using a more realistic assumption of a hurdle rate for risk adjusted returns Powell (2002)
and Weder and Wedow (2002) find much smaller changes in credit spreads.
However, the critical questions in assessing the impact of Basel II is the relationship
between regulatory and economic capital and which of them is the binding constraint. In
this paper we test these two interlinked hypothesis: Is economic or regulatory capital the
binding constraint? And: have banks already based credit decisions according to economic
capital in the past? To the extent that the new Accord succeeds in aligning regulatory
capital requirements with economic capital, which are based on modern risk management
techniques, it should have no impact on credit decisions of banks already using these
techniques.10

Group 1 banks are large, diversified and internationally active with Tier 1 capital in excess of EUR 3bn, and
Group 2 banks are generally smaller and, in many cases, more specialised.

Weder and Wedow (2002) address this question by computing a measure of economic
capital and testing its' influence on lending flows of BIS reporting banks. The advantage of
that approach is that it included most lenders, however, this comes at the cost of an
extremely aggregate perspective.
In this paper we adopt a micro view, which allows us to control for individual bank and
group characteristics. We compute bank level measures of economic and regulatory capital
for a sample covering roughly 95% of total foreign lending by German banks. The data set
has recently been compiled at the Deutsche Bundesbank and includes about 50 banks and
all credits from 1996 to 2002, thus representing on average 95% of German banks' total
foreign lending. To quantify the risk positions in German banks' foreign lending we
calculate unexpected loss using a Value at Risk model.11 This measure is then tested in a
dynamic panel model on the determinants of lending to emerging markets.
We find that Basel II regulatory capital would not have been binding in the past, which is a
prerequisite for the hypothesis of the neutrality of Basel II. Our results also support the
hypothesis that banks already base their lending decisions on credit risk models if we
restrict our sample to the more recent period and to Large Banks and Landesbanken. Given
that these banks provide the lion's share of bank lending to emerging markets, and more
banks are in the process of adopting modern risk management techniques, we conclude that
by the time Basel II will be adopted (year-end 2006) it will have only a negligible effect on
German banks' loans to emerging markets.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the model of bank
lending and the empirical strategy. Section 3 describes the data set, section 4 presents the
results. Section 5 concludes.
2 How do capital requirements impact on bank lending flows?
Our approach to estimating the impact of Basel II on banks' lending to emerging markets
is to model banks' lending decisions. For this purpose we need to establish a model of
international bank lending. Most of the existing literature on international capital flows has
taken a macroeconomic approach, focusing on push and pull factors as determinants of
11 We adopt a credit portfolio model following CreditMetrics, see J.P Morgan (1997).
- 4 -
capital flows.12 Thus these studies use aggregated data by creditor country and do not
permit a detailed analysis of individual bank behaviour. One exception, Goldberg (2001),
uses bank-level data for lending to emerging markets but likewise focuses on
macroeconomic push and pull determinants of capital flows. In contrast, our aim is to
model and test individual bank behaviour and therefore we propose a microeconomic
approach, using bank-level data for the determinants of lending flows. An advantage of
studying the effects of capital regulation at the individual bank level is that it permits
differentiation between size and ownership structure.
In what follows, we focus on the supply side of the international credit market based on the
assumption that emerging countries are mostly constrained by the supply side.13 This
implies that demand should have only a limited role on flows14 and that bank lending can
be modelled by a loan offer curve. We use a general loan offer curve by which credit
decisions depend on the expected yield over a minimum margin. The minimum margin is
the total sum of all costs that a loan causes for a bank. Consequently, credits which are
priced below the minimum margin are not profitable and will thus not be supplied. The
components of the minimum margin are the risk-free interest rate, handling charges, the
expected loss of the loan, and opportunity costs for the capital allocation associated with
the loan. The opportunity costs for the capital allocation refer to regulatory capital if the
regulatory capital requirements are binding. Otherwise they refer to economic capital
which usually is measured with the unexpected loss. Accordingly the loan supply function
is:
( , , , )
ib ib ib ib ib
L L R H EL UL
= if RCCib
 ULib
and (1)
( , , , )
ib ib ib ib ib
L L R H EL RCC
= if RCCib
> ULib
, (2)
where Lib
is the amount of credit supplied by bank b to borrower i. R is the risk-free
interest rate which is equal for all banks, Hib
are bank and country specific handling
charges and ELib
is the expected loss of a loan to country i. ULib
is the unexpected loss for a
loan to country i. It is also called marginal risk contribution. Finally, RCCib
are regulatory
capital requirements, alternatively under Basel I (RCC_Iib
) or under Basel II (RCC_IIib
).

From (1) and (2) it is apparent that regulatory capital requirements will drive banking
behaviour only if they exceed economic capital. This means that the increase of capital
costs predicted in the context of Basel II will not be relevant for bank lending to emerging
markets, provided that they remain below the unexpected loss. It is the explicit intention of
the Basel Committee to bring regulatory capital into line with economic capital from
below, and not to top it. Hence, if the Basel Accord achieves its purpose, our model
predicts that bank lending to emerging countries on average will be unaffected by Basel II.
Although (1) and (2) constitute a quite general model, there may be some practical
problems related notably to the calculation of economic capital. The methods used to
calculate unexpected loss are rather complex, and therefore it is not certain whether it is
common business practice to measure economic capital by means of the unexpected loss.
Alternatively, banks could proxy economic capital by regulatory capital. If so, according to
(1) and (2), banks' lending to emerging economies will decline irrespective of the amount
of unexpected loss, simply because under Basel II the regulatory costs for loans to risky
countries will rise. Capital arbitrage considerations may also pose a problem in this set-up.
Banks may simply base their decision to lend on regulatory capital whenever it falls below
economic capital. As a consequence, Basel II would have an impact on lending to countries
which see their regulatory capital requirements rise compared with their current treatment.
Consequently, Basel II will not affect banks' lending if economic capital exceeds
regulatory capital (under Basel I and Basel II) and, additionally, if the banks consider the
unexpected loss in their lending decisions.
The condition that economic capital exceeds regulatory capital can be formulated as a test,
either separately for each country i,

The assumption that banks measure economic capital by means of unexpected loss when
calculating their minimum margins will be tested in a panel regression framework.
Following equations (1) and (2) and the assumption that bank lending to emerging markets
is constrained by the supply side, we model credit flows as follows:

where Libt
is the first difference of credit supplied by bank b to borrower i in period t, and
Zj,ibt
is a set of control variables which in our case are the first two lags of the stock of bank
lending, time dummies and dummies for large banks and Landesbanken. ibt
is iid with
mean zero and constant variance and µib
is not correlated with the other right-hand
variables. The individual effect µib
captures unobservables at the bank level such as
handling charges, but also time-invariant characteristics that may drive credit to foreign
countries, such as cultural affinity or geographical distance.15 If banks incorporate
unexpected loss in their decisions, we would expect that the estimation of (5) results in a
coefficient for 3
which is significantly negative.
15 There are three possible panel dimensions available in the present data set: time, banks and countries. Out
of the latter two we created a new bank-country dimension which allows us to combine both dimensions and
to capture the specific lending relation within the individual effect µib.
- 7 -
16 See appendix for the sources of the data.
17 See Nestmann et. al. (2003) for a detailed description of the data set. The concept of credit exposure
applied by the credit register is regulated in section 19 of the Fifth Act amending the Banking Act, which has
been in force since the end of 1995. Accordingly, foreign country exposure covers on-balance sheet and off-
balance sheet positions. Off-balance sheet items include derivatives (other than written option positions),
guarantees assumed in respect thereof, and other off-balance sheet transactions. The following items are
deemed not to be exposures according to section 20 (6) of the Banking Act: shares in other enterprises,
irrespective of how they are shown in the balance sheet, and securities in the trading portfolio. Additionally,
exposures to German public authorities (central, state and local government) and exposures to the European
Communities are not reported. The credit risk with respect to the off-balance sheet items such as swaps,
options and futures is captured by using the credit equivalent amount measured by the marking-to-market
method. Thus, the creditor does not carry the full risk for the principal amount but only for the replacement
costs.
18 Banks included under "other banks" consist mainly of private banks. They do not dominate the sample
since these banks maintain exposures to a relatively small number of countries.
19 The information on the currency composition of German bank lending was obtained from the
Bundesbank's External Economics division. Flows were consistently corrected for Euro-US$ exchange rate
fluctuations. The procedure for exchange adjustments is as follows. First, stock data are converted from
Deutsche Mark into Euro to obtain a consistent series in Euro for the whole period. In a second step the
respective shares for bank claims in Euro, US dollar and other currencies are obtained. We then convert the
3 Empirical Strategy and Data
In order to test (3) and (4) and estimate (5) we have to deal with the fact that most of the
variables involved cannot be observed directly. The exception is the risk-free interest rate,
which we measure by the German capital market interest rate.16 In the following we
describe how we estimate credit flows (L), and proxies for the regulatory capital (RCC),
the expected loss (EL) and the marginal risk contribution (UL).
3.1 Estimating credit flows
We calculate Libt
from the Deutsche Bundesbank's credit register. The credit register
reports loans of 1.5 million Euro (formerly 3 million Deutsche Mark) or more at a
quarterly frequency.17 Since the raw data are not consolidated at banking group level and
because of various structural changes, we restrict the sample to large banks (all big banks,
Landesbanken and a large number of private banks) and the time period 1996Q3 to
2002Q2. Our sample provides on average 95% of German banks' total foreign lending
over the time period. Table A1 in the appendix provides a list of the number of banks used
in the analysis.18
Data for Libt
can be obtained by taking first-order differences of the credit stock data.
Since changes in stocks can be attributed to credit flows as well as to currency changes, we
corrected the stocks for currency fluctuations before taking differences.19
- 8 -
3.2 Estimating the regulatory capital
The regulatory capital costs under Basel I are based on the criterion of OECD membership.
Therefore, in our regression framework, RCC_Iib
is a dummy-variable with the value one if
the country is a member of the OECD and zero otherwise.
RCC_IIibt
is calculated according to the Basel II foundation internal ratings based (IRB)
calibration as formulated in the fourth consultative paper. 20 It is expected that many of the
German banks will use the foundation IRB approach once Basel II is implemented. For this
reason we concentrate on this approach and neglect the alternatives (standardised or
advanced IRB methods). We use Standard & Poor's (S&P) sovereign ratings as proxies for
banks' internal ratings and match them with the corresponding probabilities of default for
corporates. The literature has argued that the rating criteria of German banks for sovereigns
are very similar to those used by the international rating agencies.21 Therefore, S&P ratings
should be a close proxy for banks' internal ratings of public creditors. Due to a lack of data
we use sovereign ratings for the private sector, too. In this case sovereign ratings can be
regarded as an upper limit for the true ratings of the private sector.22 The regulatory capital
charge is then obtained by applying the probability of default to the Basel II formula. Since
no information on the respective maturity or loss given default rate (LGD) is available, we
use benchmark values with a maturity of 2.5 years and an LGD of 45%.
3.3 Estimating the expected loss
Expected loss ELit
is measured by an index based on the S&P ratings described in the
previous section. The rating should reflect the expected loss of the exposure for a given
loss given default and thus be closely related to the risk spread of a given borrower. Cantor
and Packer (1996) were the first to propose a numerical rating score. In their paper, ratings
were assigned a score from 1 for AAA to 20 for a selective default. Since then a number of
US dollar share (still denominated in Euro) back into US dollar at the respective end-of-quarter exchange rate
(et
) before applying the exchange rate of the previous period (et-1
) to obtain the US dollar share again in Euro
and free of exchange rate movements between the two periods. While we recognise that Euro exchange rates
against other currencies may be relevant, it should be noted that exposures in Euro and US$ are predominant
for German bank lending (see Nestmann et. al. 2003). Additionally, regressions on the flows without
currency corrections did not exhibit any different results.
20 The revision of the risk weight function focusing on unexpected loss only has been taken into account (see
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2004a).
21 Krahnen (2000), see Brunner et. al. (2000) for a discussion of internal rating procedures of German banks;
the difference between banks' and rating agencies' ratings should lie in the soft information internal to banks
acquired through banks' relationship with borrowers.
22 To obtain an idea of the possible bias arising in this context we also performed separate estimations for the
public sector, but the results did not differ.
- 9 -
studies have followed and extended their proposal. For example, Bartholdy and Lekka
(2002) additionally include rating outlooks and thus achieve an even finer distinction of
risks. In their approach each rating is assigned a score Sit
ranging from 1 for an AAA rating
to 58 for a selective default. Further, they applied a logit-type transformation of the rating
score:
ln
59
it
it
it
S
S
S
ì ü
= í ý
-
î þ
 .
We extended their approach by additionally taking Credit-Watches into account.23
Consequently, a rating change should be more imminent when a rating is under credit
watch than under a rating outlook. For this reason, we attempt to take this additional
information into account by adding (subtracting) a 2 to a given rating score when a rating
is under positive (negative) credit watch, while only a 1 is added (subtracted) when a
positive (negative) outlook is assigned to a given rating. As a result, the rating score is
considerably expanded and allows for more variation (see Table A4 for details). It should
be noted, however, that different specifications and transformations of the rating scores
lead to similar results in the regression.
3.4 Estimating the marginal risk contribution
Uibt
is the marginal risk contribution of a loan to the unexpected losses of the whole credit
portfolio. Hence in a first step the unexpected loss has to be determined at the portfolio
level and in a second step it is disaggregated at the country level.
The most widespread gauge of a portfolio's unexpected loss is the Value at Risk (VaR).
VaR is the maximum loss over a target horizon such that with a pre-specified high
probability, pc, the actual loss will be smaller. It can be determined from the distribution of
the portfolio losses at the target horizon as the difference between the mean of the portfolio
value and the value at the pc-percentile. To obtain the marginal risk contribution, the VaR
is weighted by the ratio which divides the covariance between the portfolio loss (PLbt
) and
the loss to country i (PLibt
) by the portfolio's variance of the portfolio loss. Note that these
weights ensure that the marginal risk contributions add up to the VaR:
23 Standard & Poor's (2003b) define a credit watch as "..highlighting the potential direction of a short- or
long term rating where the focus is on identifiable events and short term trends that cause the rating to be
placed under special surveillance".

and cov (sdv) stand for the covariance (standard deviation) operator. The values for the
weights and for the VaR have to be taken from the distribution of the portfolio value.
The credit portfolio's value distribution can be estimated using a credit risk model. Our
database lends itself to using a simplified version of CreditMetrics.24 The basic
assumptions of CreditMetrics are that the returns of a creditor are normally distributed,
further, that a default occurs when the returns of a creditor fall under a certain threshold,
and that the probability of the default event can be taken from the probability of default
associated with the creditor's rating. As for the estimation of RCC, here we also use the
Standard & Poor's country ratings and the one-year probabilities of default for corporates
to compute default thresholds.25 We further assume that the correlation between the returns
of a country can be measured by the returns from stock market indices and compute a
correlation matrix of the returns for all countries in the sample with the stock market total
return indices provided by Morgan Stanley. It should be noted that the index is only
available for a total of 51 countries (see Appendix for a list of country names).
The current value of a bank's overall portfolio at the beginning of a period is given by the
sum of the bank's individual exposures to each country Libt
which we take from the credit
register as described above.26 We then simulate returns using a multivariate normal
distribution with mean zero and the correlation matrix from the stock market total return
indices. Default occurs when the simulated return falls below the threshold given by the
critical value that is derived from the default probability. In line with the Consultative
Paper 4, we assume that loss given default (LGD) is constant and equals 45%27 and
calculate the simulated portfolio value at the end of the period. We then repeat this exercise
100,000 times in order to obtain the simulated loss distribution of bank b in period t. In
24 J.P. Morgan (1997)
25 The Basel Committee (1999) notes that most banks apply a one-year time horizon across all asset classes.
26 It should be noted that the country exposures have been corrected by deducting public guarantees, since the
risks are transferred to a guarantor which exhibits practically zero risk.
27 We further assumed that the correlation between probabilities of default and LGD is constant and equal to
zero. The same applies to LGD between borrowers. This is consistent with the assumptions of the Basel
- 11 -
order to obtain a panel of observations for Uibt
we also calculate class distributions for each
banking group and each period in our sample.
Summary statistics and a correlation matrix are given in Appendix Tables A6 and A7.

We start by analysing the question of whether economic capital is binding when compared
with a hypothetic regulatory capital according to Basel II over the last 6 years. This will be
the case if economic capital exceeds regulatory capital (RCC_II). We first test the
hypothesis of equation (4), that is comparing the means of UL and RCC_II, both calculated
over all periods, countries and banks. The results of the t-test are reported in Table 1.

The tests indicate that regulatory capital is not binding, because the mean of economic
capital exceeds or equals the regulatory requirement. This result still holds when choosing
a confidence level of 99.5%. To our knowledge banks typically do not work with
confidence levels lower than 99.5%.
However, the outcome of the test could be driven by single countries or quarters. To check
the robustness of our results, we also computed test statistics according to equation (4), i.e.
for individual countries at the 99.9% confidence level and, additionally, for individual
quarters (see Tables A2 and A3 in the appendix). We find only a few countries and no
period for which regulatory capital is binding. So overall, the data confirm our thesis that
(at least on average) economic capital exceeds regulatory capital.

migration ("mark-to-market").

One caveat in interpreting this result is that of the test might depend on the specific model
we used to proxy the marginal risk contributions, namely CreditMetrics. There are other
models in use like Credit Risk + (Credit Suisse First Boston 1997), Credit Portfolio View
(Wilson 1998), or KMV (Kealhofer 1995) and it would be interesting to experiment with
them. The first best choice would be to use data on the actual marginal risk contributions in
each bank, however, such data has not been collected.
As a second condition for the neutrality of Basel II we test whether banks' lending
decisions are influenced by the marginal risk contribution. To this end we estimate the
regression given in (5). Since we use the lagged endogenous variable as explanatory, we
apply the Blundell/Bond system GMM estimator.28 We show the results for the full bank
sample, and separately for Large banks, Landesbanken and remaining other banks, which
are mainly small private banks.29
Table 2 presents the results. For the full sample of banks neither of our variables of interest
is significant. This seems to be mainly due to the heterogeneity between banking groups.
When differentiating between banking groups the following picture emerges: The
coefficient for marginal risk contribution (UL) is negative and significant at the 1 percent
conficence level for Large Banks and other banks. Unexpected loss seems to have
determined lending by these banking groups. For the Landesbanken, on the other hand,
unexpected loss is not statistically significant.
Somewhat surprisingly, the interest rate and expected loss are insignificant in most
estimates. A possible reason for the latter might be that banks use internal ratings, which
differ significantly from the ones of S&P. For instance Krahnen (2000) argues that internal
ratings of German banks are more volatile than ratings of external rating agencies, which
may be due to soft factors that are not publicly known and part of banks' informational
lead and thus represents the value added of internal ratings. However, to our knowledge,
this argument applies mostly for internal ratings of firms and less so to sovereign ratings.

#Hansen test for over-identifying restrictions.
It is important to note that the results are largely based on data before the first Basel II
proposals were published. Since then Landesbanken (like many other banks) may have
been modernizing their risk management taking the proposals into account. We test
whether this "phasing in" is important by limiting the estimation for the time after the first
Consultative Paper was published by the Basel Committee in June 1999. Now the results
(given in Table 3) confirm that overall banks have based their international lending
decisions on unexpected loss considerations. The variable unexpected loss enters
significantly in the lending equation for the full sample, Large Banks and Landesbanken.
30 Only asymptotically more efficient two-step Blundell-Bond system GMM estimates are reported. To
compensate for the downward bias in two-step estimates of the standard errors the finite-sample correction
derived by Windmeijer (2000) is applied. Regression results have been obtained combining the columns of
the instrument matrix and thus use only one instrument for each variable and lag distance, rather than one for
each time period, variable and lag distance.
- 14 -
This results support the view that lending has increasingly been determined by economic
capital in preparation for Basel II.

#Hansen test for overidentifying restrictions.
Next we check whether the result is robust to the inclusion of regulatory capital according
to Basel I (RCC_I). Recall from above that under Basel I all OECD countries have a zero
capital requirement, while non OECD countries have a risk weight of one hundred. Given
the results of Table 2 we would expect that regulatory capital had no influence on lending
decisions. We now test the question from another angle by including both Basel I
regulatory capital (which is simply an OECD dummy) and unexpected loss in the lending
equation. The results in the Appendix Table A5. In none of the cases regulatory capital is
positive and significant. Thus Basel I does not seem to have impacted lending decisions,
- 15 -
and regulatory arbitrage opportunities under Basel I seem to have played a minor role only.
The result further corroborates our hypothesis that the introduction of Basel II will not lead
to considerable adjustments in the banks' portfolios. Finally, it should be noted that the
significance of unexpected loss is not robust to the inclusion of the OECD dummy for the
overall results and other banks. Since the correlation between the variables of interest is
low (see Appendix Table A7) we cannot attribute this finding to the collinearity among the
variables, but rather to the heterogeneity among the group of other banks.
5 Conclusion
The empirical evidence presented in this paper suggests that Basel II will have a limited
effect on loans to emerging markets, as least if German Banks are representative of other
banking systems. According to the evidence presented here the Basel Committee seems to
have achieved the goal of bringing regulatory capital in line with economic capital from
below. It seems to be that the capital costs will not rise on average and, additionally, that
most internationally active banks have already adopted modern risk assessment tools for
their decisions.
Specifically we showed that on average economic capital is higher than regulatory capital
under Basel II. This is true for plausible levels of confidence in calculating economic
capital based on a Value at Risk Model. We then proceeded to estimate a dynamic panel
regression of determinants of lending to emerging markets. We find that economic capital
is a significant determinant of the Large banks' loan decisions. When we restrict the
sample to more recent years economic capital enters significantly for all banks. Further, we
find no evidence that banks have biased their lending towards OECD emerging markets for
which capital costs are zero under Basel I. We therefore expect that by the time the Basel II
rules will become effective they will have only a negligible effect on German banks' loans
to emerging markets.
