Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in industrialized
societies and is becoming increasingly prevalent in the United
States. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) indicates that the prevalence of obesity
(body mass index [BMI] 30.0) increased from 14.5% in 1976­
1980 to 22.5% in 1988­1994.1 This increase was observed in
both women and men, and in black, Mexican­American, and
white ethnic groups.1 High prevalence of obesity, as well as
increasing prevalence, have been documented by other studies
conducted in the US and internationally.2­5 These trends are im-
portant given the association between obesity and adverse
health outcomes, including all-cause and cardiovascular disease
(CVD) mortality.6,7 Furthermore, there is evidence that abdom-
inal obesity is associated with CVD risk factors, as indicated by
high serum insulin, non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM),
high blood lipids, and hypertension.8­10

Country of birth, acculturation status and
abdominal obesity in a national sample of
Mexican­American women and men
Jan Sundquista,b and Marilyn Winklebya
Background Few studies have examined the influence of country of birth and acculturation
status on indicators of obesity using national samples of Mexican­American women
and men.
Methods We analysed data for 1387 Mexican­American women and 1404 Mexican­
American men, ages 25­64, from the third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (1988­1994). We examined whether waist circumference and
abdominal obesity varied by country of birth and acculturation status (primary
language spoken), and whether among those with abdominal obesity, number of
associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors varied by country of birth and
acculturation status.
Results Both country of birth and, to a lesser degree, acculturation status were signifi-
cantly associated with waist circumference and abdominal obesity. Mexican-born
women and men had the smallest waist circumference (90.4 cm, 94.0 cm
respectively), US-born English-speaking women and men had intermediate waist
circumference (93.6 cm, 97.3 cm), and US-born Spanish-speaking women and
men had the largest waist circumference (96.9 cm, 97.7 cm), after accounting for
age, education, per cent of energy from dietary fat, leisure-time physical activity,
and smoking. All women had high prevalences of abdominal obesity, particularly
US-born Spanish-speaking women (68.7%). In addition, US-born Spanish-speaking
women with abdominal obesity were significantly more likely than their counter-
parts to have one or more of the following CVD risk factors: high serum insulin,
non-insulin dependent diabetes, high blood lipids, and/or hypertension.
Conclusions These findings illustrate the heterogeneity of the Mexican­American population
and suggest that country of birth and lack of acculturation to the majority
culture, as well as secondary lifestyle changes, may explain the significant clinical
differences observed in abdominal obesity within Mexican­American population
subgroups.

There are large differences in the prevalence of obesity across
ethnic groups,1,11 with the problem being particularly import-
ant in the Mexican­American population,2­17 which it is increas-
ing rapidly. Between 1980 and 1990 the Hispanic population, of
whom 63% are Mexican­American, increased by 45% com-
pared with 7% for the overall population, with projected
increases in population size from 31.4 million people in 2000 to
96.5 million people in 2050.18,19
There are also differences in the prevalence of obesity within
the Mexican­American population, indicating a heterogeneity
that is important to examine further. For example, the San
Antonio Heart Study showed that Mexican­American women
living in more affluent suburbs had a mean BMI of 24.5 while
those living in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged
neighbourhoods had a mean BMI of 28.3.13 Corresponding
BMI levels for Mexican­American men in these areas were 26.9
and 27.8, respectively.
There are additional variations in obesity among populations
that have migrated to new countries, suggesting that factors
associated with the migration process (e.g. change in diet, exer-
cise, and stress) may adversely influence body weight. Prospec-
tive studies have shown significant BMI increases following
immigration to a new country. A prospective study of 654 adult
Tokelauans who migrated to New Zealand because of a natural
disaster showed that their BMI levels increased from 24.1 to
28.7 between 1968 and 1982 compared with non-migrants
whose BMI levels increased from 24.8 to 26.1.20 Moreover, an
8-year prospective study from Sweden showed a significant net
increase in BMI levels among men who immigrated from South
Europe to Sweden compared to a reference group of men who
had not immigrated (BMI levels for immigrant men increased
from 25.5 to 27.0 compared to 24.6 to 25.0 for non-immigrant
men, after adjustment for age, leisure-time physical activity,
smoking, education, and health status).5
In addition to the possible adverse effects of migration on
body weight, several studies have suggested that the degree to
which people acculturate to the majority culture following
migration may influence weight. A cross-sectional analysis of
Mexican­American women and men from the Hispanic Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) showed that
preference for speaking Spanish (indicating a lower level of
acculturation) was associated with a significantly higher BMI in
women but not in men.21 Hazuda et al.22,23 examined the
multidimensional aspects of acculturation and its association
with body weight by constructing the following three accultura-
tion scales: functional integration with mainstream American
culture, worth placed on conserving Mexican culture, and
attitudes toward traditional family structure. The scales showed
different associations with body weight, with the first scale (low
functional integration) showing the strongest association, but
only for women and not for men.23 In contrast, the well-known
study on acculturation and weight, which involved a cohort of
4653 men of Japanese ancestry living in Hawaii, found that
men who were most traditional had significantly lower levels of
BMI (mean of 23) than those who were more acculturated
(mean of 26).24
In this analysis we used data from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a large
national sample of women and men living in the US. We
examined whether abdominal obesity differed among three
groups of Mexican­American women and men who reflect
different stages of migration and acculturation: those born in
Mexico, those born in the US whose primary language was
Spanish, and those born in the US whose primary language was
English. We also examined whether among those with
abdominal obesity, risk of associated CVD risk factors (indicated
by high serum insulin, NIDDM, high blood lipids, and hyper-
tension)25­27 varied according to the three migration/
acculturation groups.
We chose waist circumference as our measure of abdominal
obesity for the following reasons. First, waist circumference is
more strongly related to the metabolically active visceral adipose
tissue and therefore more biologically interpretable than the
more widely used measure of abdominal obesity, the waist to
hip ratio (WHR).28,29 Second, several studies have concluded
that waist circumference alone is more closely associated with
the amount of abdominal, visceral obesity than the WHR, and
recommend that waist circumference should be used to esti-
mate risk of CVD28,30 and NIDDM.31 Third, a 7-year prospec-
tive study revealed that waist circumference was the best
predictor of NIDDM compared to BMI, WHR, triceps and sub-
scapular skinfolds in Mexican­American women and men.32
Methods
The NHANES III study, conducted between 1988 and 1994 by
the National Center for Health Statistics, was designed to collect
information to assess the health status of the US civilian non-
institutionalized population aged 2 months.33 The NHANES
III sample design is similar to that of the previous NHANES,
which used a stratified multistage probability design.34,35 It
included an oversampling of both the Mexican­American and
black American populations so that the sample could produce
statistically reliable health estimates for the two largest ethnic
minority groups in the US.
The NHANES III data were collected via standardized ques-
tionnaires administered by bilingual interviewers and exam-
iners at participants' homes, and laboratory tests conducted at
NHANES mobile examination centres. Of the 40 600 people
invited to participate, 86% completed the home questionnaire,
and 78% completed both the medical examination and the
home questionnaire (n = 33 994).
The sample for our analyses includes 1387 Mexican­
American women and 1404 Mexican­American men, 25­64
years of age, who completed both the home questionnaire and
medical examination. We used age 25 as our lower age cut-
point because educational attainment (a covariate in our multi-
variate regression models) is often not completed before this
age. We used age 64 as our upper age cut-point because of life-
style changes associated with retirement and ageing after 65.36
We excluded data for pregnant women (n = 69) and surveys
coded as unreliable (n = 3). Missing data were as follows for the
outcome variables; waist (4.0%), BMI (0.4%), serum insulin
(3.6%), NIDDM (0.2%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(4.3%), serum triglycerides (3.7%), and hypertension (4.4%).
Definition of variables
Migration and acculturation status were indicated by country
of birth and primary language spoken at home. Race-ethnic
groups were based upon combinations of the race and ethnicity
ABDOMINAL OBESITY IN MEXICAN­AMERICAN ADULTS 471
reported by the participants. Respondents who chose Mexican
or Mexican­American ethnicity are included in this analysis.
Waist circumference was measured with the person in the
erect position, with an inelastic tape at the level of the natural
waist (the most narrow part of the torso).37 Abdominal obesity
was defined as a waist circumference of 102 cm for men and
88 cm for women, these cut-points representing a substan-
tially increased risk of future adverse health outcomes and CVD
risk factors.10,38 As a measure of general obesity, a risk factor
associated with CVD, we used BMI.
The CVD risk factors were defined as follows. Non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus was defined as having an 8-hour
fast and plasma glucose levels 126 mg/dl and/or a medical
history of diabetes (other than during pregnancy) with an age
of onset 25 years.39 Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(non-HDL-C) was calculated as the difference between total chol-
esterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Non-HDL-C,
which may be a better indicator of atherogenic lipoprotein par-
ticles than indirectly estimated low-density lipoprotein chol-
esterol,40 does not require fasting blood samples and therefore
allowed the use of the entire NHANES III sample. Non-HDL-C
(mmol/l), insulin (U/ml), and triglycerides (mmol/l) were
measured from serum specimens. All blood specimens were
obtained by a venipuncture. High insulin levels were defined as
mean + 2 standard deviations (SD) for the entire NHANES III
sample. High non-HDL-C cholesterol and high triglyceride
levels were defined as 4.0 mmol/l and 2.26 mmol/l, respec-
tively.41 Blood pressure was measured on the right arm by
health examiners or physicians while the participant was seated
during the medical examination; the mean of the second and
third of three blood pressure readings was used. Hypertension
was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg and/or
diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg and/or current use of
antihypertensive medications.42
Data analysis
Primary analyses, using linear models, were carried out in
SUDAAN, to adjust for the complex sample design of NHANES
III.43 All analyses incorporated sampling weights that adjusted
for unequal probabilities of selection. Sample weights were also
adjusted for non-respondents' characteristics. Analyses were
run separately for women and men. The primary outcome vari-
able was waist circumference; the predictor variables were
country of birth and acculturation status (three groups--born in
Mexico and used as the reference group, born in the US and
Spanish-speaking, born in the US and English-speaking). The
following potential confounding factors were included as
covariates in the linear models: age (in years, centred at the
sample mean to aid in the interpretation of the regression
coefficients), years of education (continuous and centred), per
cent of energy from dietary fat (based on a single 24-hour
dietary recall and administered by trained dietary interviewers);
no leisure-time physical activity (based on whether individuals
had engaged in any leisure time physical activity in the past
month, including exercises, sports, or physically active hobbies--
those who reported no leisure-time activities were considered
physically inactive); and current cigarette smoker (determined by
self-report and based on whether individuals had smoked 100
cigarettes during their lifetime and whether they were current
smokers). We validated self-reported smoking by examining a
biochemical measure, serum cotinine, and found that under-
reporting did not differ significantly between the three groups
for either women or men. We included all first order inter-
actions between predictor variables in the linear models.
Results
Individuals born in the US who were Spanish-speaking were
older, less likely to live in urban areas, and more likely to live
in the South (predominantly Texas), than their counterparts
(Table 1). Mexican­Americans born in the US who were English-
speaking had substantially higher levels of education, lower
levels of poverty, and higher employment rates than the other
two groups. Although all groups reported moderately high
percentages of energy from total fat, those born in Mexico
reported the lowest percentages. Women born in Mexico
reported the lowest levels of leisure-time activity and were the
least likely to be current cigarette smokers.
Both country of birth and, to a lesser degree, acculturation
status (indicated by primary language spoken) were signifi-
cantly associated with waist circumference in the linear model
(Table 2). After adjustment for age, education, per cent of energy
from dietary fat, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking,
waist circumference was significantly larger in US-born women
and men who spoke English or Spanish than Mexican-born
women and men, indicating an influence of country of birth.
There was also a significant difference in waist circumference
between Spanish- and English-speaking US-born women
(P-value = 0.04), indicating an influence of acculturation
(evident when examining further contrasts in the linear model).
There was no significant difference between Spanish- and
English-speaking US-born men.
The magnitude of the differences in waist circumference by
country of birth was large; for example the beta coefficient of
6.5 for the comparison of US-born Spanish-speaking women to
Mexican-born women indicates that the former group had, on
average, a waist circumference that was 6.5 cm larger than the
Mexican-born women having comparable age, education, smok-
ing, leisure-time physical activity and energy from fat. There
were two modestly significant interactions for men, but when
examined in more depth, neither were clinically meaningful.
Table 3 presents the unadjusted and adjusted means for waist
circumference and BMI by country of birth and acculturation
status. After adjustment for age, education, dietary fat, leisure-
time physical activity, and smoking, Mexican-born women and
men had the smallest waist circumference (90.4 cm, 94.0 cm
respectively), US-born English-speaking women and men had
intermediate waist circumference (93.6 cm, 97.3 cm), and US-
born Spanish-speaking women and men had the largest waist
circumference (96.9 cm, 97.7 cm). The corresponding adjusted
levels for white women and men (presented for reference only)
were 87.9 cm for women and 96.8 cm for men.
Using the recommended cut-points for abdominal obesity
(88 cm waist circumference for women and 102 cm for
men)10,38 we found a gradient effect (Figure 1): US-born
Spanish-speaking women and men had the highest levels of
abdominal obesity (68.7% and 39.5% obese, respectively),
US-born English-speaking women and men had intermediate
levels (58.6% and 31.8% obese), and Mexican-born women
and men had the lowest levels (55.6% and 21.4% obese). The

corresponding percentages for white women and men were
45.4% and 31.4%, respectively. It is important to note the sub-
stantially higher levels of abdominal obesity in women than
men for all subgroups.
High insulin levels, NIDDM, elevated cholesterol and trigly-
cerides, and hypertension are among the main risk factors asso-
ciated with CVD.44 In Table 4 we present the percentages with
high serum insulin (mean + 2 SD), NIDDM, high non-HDL
cholesterol (4.0 mmol/l), high triglycerides (2.26 mmol/l),
and hypertension among those with abdominal obesity.10,38
Although there were some inconsistencies among the indi-
vidual risk factors, women born in the US who were Spanish-
speaking and who had abdominal obesity were significantly
more likely to have one or more CVD risk factors than their
counterparts. Among men, there were no significant differences.
Discussion
In this analysis of a large national sample of Mexican­American
women and men living in the US, we found important and sig-
nificant clinical differences in waist circumference and abdom-
inal obesity among three population groups, suggesting that
country of birth (for both women and men) and acculturation
status (for women only) are associated with the pathogenesis of
obesity. We found that Mexican-born women and men had the
smallest waist circumference, English-speaking US-born women
and men had intermediate waist circumference, and Spanish-
speaking US-born women and men had the largest waist cir-
cumference, when age, education, per cent of energy from dietary
fat, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking were taken into
account. The prevalence of abdominal obesity paralleled these
findings, and showed that 68.7% of Spanish-speaking US-born
women and 39.5% of Spanish-speaking US-born men had
abdominal obesity, indicating substantial risk of CVD.
It is well-known that obesity is strongly associated with
behavioural, cultural, and societal factors.5,45­48 This associa-
tion has been established, in part, by migration studies that
have shown increasing levels of obesity among populations that
migrate, as well as those that have low levels of acculturation to
the majority culture.5,20,49 Mechanisms proposed as possible
explanations are lifestyle changes,5,50 dietary changes,51,52 lack
of educational or occupational opportunities,47,48,53 and/or other
structural inequalities.50
Our findings of an association between country of birth and
abdominal obesity (waist circumference) are consistent with
findings from the Hispanic HANES that showed that BMI was
larger for second and third generation Mexican­Americans than
for first generation Mexican­Americans.21 In addition, Hispanic
HANES found that Mexican­American women with a prefer-
ence for the English language had significantly lower levels of
BMI than those with a preference for the Spanish language, a
finding which agrees with the present study. The San Antonio
Heart Study also demonstrated that Mexican­American women
with lower acculturation levels (low functional integration) had
higher levels of central obesity (subscapular-to-triceps skinfold-
thickness ratio) than women with higher acculturation levels.23

Underlying mechanisms
It is possible that the biological pathway between migration,
acculturation, and abdominal obesity may be mediated by a
long-term stress reaction.54­56 Stress can result in either an
acute fight or flight reaction, the first leading to control and the
second leading to a long-term defeat reaction, characterized by
depression or helplessness.57,58 Abdominal obesity has been
shown to be associated with the long-term defeat reaction, in
which the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is activated with
an increase of cortisol levels, which changes fat metabolism and
can result in a central distribution of fat.26,59­61 Migration,
whether forced by poverty or persecution, leading to settlement
in a different social, political and cultural context, might result
in a long-term defeat reaction regardless of previous health. In
addition to migration stress, not speaking the language of the
majority culture may indicate a separation from the majority
culture and create long-term acculturative stress.
It is unlikely that the differences in abdominal obesity that we
found between the three migration/acculturation groups can be
explained solely by genetic differences. Although it is estimated
that genetic factors may explain from 30% to 70% of cases of
obesity in the US, the rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity
over the last two decades is likely due to environmental factors
since the gene pool has been stable over the same time inter-
val.62 Furthermore, in a population of Mexican­American
adults from the San Antonio Heart Study, it was estimated that
genes accounted for only 15% to 30% of the phenotypic varia-
tion in measures of obesity.63 Although genes may play an
important role in the metabolism of adipose tissue, the large
differences in weight-related outcomes that we observed within
a single ethnic group of Mexican­Americans suggests that the
current epidemic of obesity is largely environmental, either
directly or via an interaction with genetic influences.
Our findings that a high proportion of women and men have
abdominal obesity suggest that many Mexican­Americans may
be at risk for additional CVD risk factors and metabolic compli-
cations.64 Björntorp26 suggested that the primary factors in the
`syndrome of visceral obesity' or the metabolic syndrome, are
overeating, physical inactivity, smoking, and stress. These may
act via neuroendocrine pathways to induce insulin resistance,
increased serum insulin and abdominal obesity, which can lead
to diseases such as diabetes. The Metabolic Syndrome could be
called a `Civilization Syndrome' because of its strong relation-
ship with an urban sedentary lifestyle and a positive energy
balance (overeating and lack of leisure-time physical activity).10
We suggest that the severe stress that can be associated with
lack of acculturation to the majority culture and secondary life-
style changes may induce an increase in weight, consistent with
the findings in the present study.
Strengths and limitations
The NHANES III study is one of the most comprehensive
national surveys to date. Extensive and complete data are avail-
able from both the home survey and medical examination, includ-
ing standardized measures of waist circumference. As noted
previously, response rates were high and there was minimal
missing data. Unlike many surveys, NHANES III represents a
sample of the US population and therefore results are generaliz-
able to the population of Mexican­Americans living in the US. It
also included an oversampling of Mexican­Americans to ensure
that large numbers would be available for analyses. In addition,
NHANES III assessed BMI as well as waist circumference, which
may be a stronger predictor of obesity complications than BMI.65
Despite these strengths, there are several limitations to the
NHANES III survey. First, it is based on a cross-sectional survey
design that does not allow one to draw inferences about causal
pathways. Second, there were limitations to several of the
variables we used, including our outcome measure, waist cir-
cumference. Although exact methods exist for measuring the
visceral adipose tissue accumulation, such as magnetic reson-
ance imaging and computerized tomography, NHANES III did
not use these more exact methods. However, studies of
anthropometric correlates have found that waist circumference
is the preferred clinical and epidemiological method to use
because of its association with visceral adiposity, low cost and
ease of measurement.10,28,38

a Source: National Center for Health Statistics, NHANES III, 1988­1994. Abdominal obesity defined as 88 cm for women, and 102 cm for men.
b If there was a significant difference among the three Mexican­American groups, then pairwise 2 tests were conducted to identify which groups were
different. An asterisk indicates a significant (P  0.01) difference for the indicated group compared to the group with the highest value.
c Data for white, non-Hispanic women and men are presented for reference and not included in the pairwise 2 tests.
In addition, NHANES III lacks measures of physical activity at
work, which may influence the gender differences that we
found for leisure-time physical inactivity (significant for women
but not for men, Table 2). Finally, our measure of acculturation,
indicated by primary language spoken at home, is a static factor
that does not measure core beliefs and practices in relation to
specific CVD risk factors or medical conditions, and does not
consider the social context of behaviour.66,67
In summary, we found substantial variation in waist cir-
cumference and abdominal obesity among three subgroups of
Mexican­Americans living in the US, distinguished by country
of birth and acculturation status. All women, but in particular
US-born Spanish-speaking women (68.7%), had high preval-
ence of abdominal obesity. The variation we found in abdominal
obesity illustrates the heterogeneity of the Mexican­American
population and suggests that both country of birth and
acculturation status influence indicators of obesity. To address
these variations, social and economic interventions are needed
as well as lifestyle and public health policy interventions, such
as those that influence food consumption patterns and stim-
ulate physical activity.66,67 As with all interventions, there is a
need for primary prevention efforts that begin early in life that
are linguistically and culturally appropriate.
