Revised Prevalence Estimates of Mental Disorders
in the United States
Using a Clinical Significance Criterion to Reconcile 2 Surveys' Estimates
William E. Narrow, MD, MPH; Donald S. Rae, MA; Lee N. Robins, PhD; Darrel A. Regier, MD, MPH
Background: Current US mental disorder prevalence
estimates have limited usefulness for service planning
and are often discrepant. Data on clinical significance
from the National Institute of Mental Health Epi-
demiologic Catchment Area Program (ECA) and the
National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) were used to pro-
duce revised estimates, for more accurate projections
of treatment need and further explication of rate dis-
crepancies.
Methods: To ascertain the prevalence of clinically sig-
nificant mental disorders in each survey, responses to
questions on life interference from, telling a profes-
sional about, or using medication for symptoms were ap-
plied to cases meeting symptom criteria in the ECA
(n=20861) and NCS (n=8098). A revised national preva-
lence estimate was made by selecting the lower estimate
of the 2 surveys for each diagnostic category, account-
ing for comorbidity, and combining categories.
Results: Using data on clinical significance lowered the
past-year prevalence rates of "any disorder" among 18-
to 54-year-olds by 17% in the ECA and 32% in the NCS.
For adults older than 18 years, the revised estimate for
any disorder was 18.5%. Using the clinical significance
criterion reduced disparities between estimates in the 2
surveys. Validity of the criterion was supported by asso-
ciations with disabilities and suicidal behavior.
Conclusions: Establishing the clinical significance of dis-
orders in the community is crucial for estimating treat-
ment need. More work should be done in defining and
operationalizing clinical significance, and characteriz-
ing the utility of clinically significant symptoms in de-
termining treatment need even when some criteria of the
disorder are not met. Discrepancies in ECA and NCS re-
sults are largely due to methodologic differences.

AMONG THE issues facing the
field of psychiatric epide-
miology are 2 challenges
for future research. The
first relates to limitations
in currently available surveys as tools for
mental health service planning. Two large
community surveys, the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health Epidemiologic
Catchment Area Program (ECA) and the
National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), have
been the main sources for estimates of
treatment need in the United States.1-3
These surveys showed overall 1-year men-
tal and addictive disorder prevalence rates
approaching 30% and lifetime rates ap-
proaching 50%. If these prevalence rates
are taken as a proxy for mental health treat-
ment need, the mental health system
would have to expand enormously to meet
this need, with attendant increases in
workforce deployment and overall costs.
Alternatively, the clinical significance of
these community-based rates, and there-
fore their suitability as a proxy for treat-
ment need, has been questioned.4,5 The
high disorder rates in the ECA and NCS
were accompanied by low service use rates,
with less than one third of persons with
an active mental disorder using mental
health services in a 1-year period.6,7 The
extent to which the untreated cases rep-
resent unmet need for treatment as op-
posed to absence of need for treatment
because of mild or transient symptoms is
not clear.8-11 A closer examination of the
clinical significance of community preva-
lence rates is warranted.
The second challenge is methodo-
logic, having to do with explaining the
differences in the prevalence rates of
individual disorders between the ECA
and the NCS. Reconciling these differ-
ences is important for policy and plan-
ning purposes, in that more consistent
results will lead to less confusion among
the end users of the data and more

confidence in the reliability of the methods and the
diagnoses themselves. Recent work4 showed that the
differences could be partially reconciled by accounting
for changes in diagnostic criteria between DSM-III and
DSM-III-R (particularly for the anxiety disorders), and
the different age ranges in the 2 surveys. Several factors
could not be controlled for, including different sam-
pling frames, the use of a "commitment question" in
the NCS, and stem question placement and other differ-
ences (eg, a more complete assessment of phobias) in
the NCS diagnostic interview. Another factor that has
been raised but not empirically examined is whether
the cases identified by these different survey methods
differ in the clinical significance of their symptoms.
That is, do higher rates indicate an improved sensitivity
of the methods and instrumentation to identify clini-
cally significant cases, or an oversensitivity, in that the
excess cases meet symptom criteria but are not clini-
cally significant?
The concept of clinical significance of mental dis-
orders plays a role in both of these issues. Clinical sig-
nificance has been a part of the DSM definition of men-
METHODS
EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEYS
The National Institute of Mental Health ECA has been
described at length in previous publications.1,2,18 It was
conducted from 1980 to 1985 in 5 sites, which provided
18571 household and 2290 institutional residents 18
years and older. Two face-to-face interviews were done 12
months apart (wave 1 and wave 2). A telephone interview
(face-to-face in New Haven, Conn) of the household
respondents was conducted 6 months after wave 1. Ques-
tions on use of health services were asked at each inter-
view. Diagnostic data were obtained at waves 1 and 2
only. The data were weighted to account for unequal
probabilities of selection for each person sampled and for
nonresponse. The data were also weighted on the basis of
the age, sex, and race or ethnicity distribution of the 1990
US Census. The DSM-III psychiatric diagnoses were
assessed with the DIS.
The NCS3 was a cross-sectional survey of a nation-
ally representative household sample of 8098 adoles-
cents and adults aged 15 to 54 years, conducted from
1990 to 1992. Data were weighted to account for nonre-
sponse and unequal probabilities of selection, and to
adjust the data to national population distributions on
the basis of the 1989 US National Health Interview Sur-
vey. The UM-CIDI was used to obtain DSM-III-R diag-
noses. Although generalized anxiety disorder and post-
traumatic stress disorder were assessed only in the NCS,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, somati-
zation disorder, and cognitive impairment were assessed
only in the ECA.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE QUESTIONS
In the ECA DIS, the clinical significance questions were
as follows: Did you tell a doctor about (symptom[s])? Did
you tell any other professional about (symptom[s])?
Did you take medicine for (symptom[s]) more than once?
Did (symptom[s]) interfere with your life or activities a lot?
The NCS included the following clinical significance ques-
tions: Did you ever tell a doctor other than a psychiatrist
about (symptom[s])? Did you ever see a mental health spe-
cialist about your (symptom[s])? Did you ever see any other
professional about (symptom[s])? Did you ever take medi-
cation more than once because of (symptom[s])? How much
did your (symptom[s]) ever interfere with your life or ac-
tivities--a lot, some, a little, or not at all?
Although the questions assessing clinical signifi-
cance were similar in the 2 studies, they were applied
differently. In the DIS, for anxiety disorders, dysthymia,
schizophrenia, somatization disorder, anorexia nervosa,
and antisocial personality disorder, the clinical signifi-
cance of a symptom was determined by using a decision
tree of clinical significance questions posed to the
respondent. When the respondent acknowledged talking
to a physician or other professional, or taking medicine,
or that the symptom interfered with his or her life a lot,
then the symptom was treated as clinically significant.
For these disorders, the diagnostic algorithms were con-
structed so that only clinically significant symptoms
were considered. For ECA diagnoses of major depres-
sion, mania, and drug use disorders, and for virtually all
of the NCS diagnoses, individual symptoms were not
assessed for clinical significance. Rather, at the end of
each diagnostic module, clinical significance questions
were posed to those respondents who had sufficient
symptoms for a potential diagnosis. The results of these
questions could then be applied, independently of the
diagnostic algorithm, to the persons who met symptom
criteria for a disorder.
SERVICE USE
Service use during a 1-year period for mental health or sub-
stance use problems was assessed. For the ECA, treatment
data came from the initial interview, or from the 6-month
and 12-month follow-up interviews, depending on when
the respondent's mental disorder was detected.6 For the NCS,
a retrospective report of treatment during the year before
the interview was used. Ambulatory settings were catego-
rized into specialty mental and addictive or general medi-
cal sectors. Combined, these 2 sectors are referred to as the
health systems sector.6
CRITERION VALIDITY
To provide a test of the validity of the clinically signifi-
cant mental disorders, several variables indicative of
clinical severity and disability were chosen. From both
surveys, lifetime history of suicidal ideation and suicide
attempts, and whether the respondent was in full-time
work or school, were used. From the NCS only, an item
was used that inquired whether in the past month the
respondent had been unable to work or had had to cut
back on work or usual activities for 2 or more days.
From the ECA only, receipt of disability compensation
was used.

tal disorder starting with DSM-III.12 Currently, DSM-
IV13 defines a mental disorder as
a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome
or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated
with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e.,
impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or
with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, dis-
ability, or an important loss of freedom.13(pxxi)
The concept was further highlighted in DSM-IV by its
inclusion in the diagnostic criteria for many disorders,
in the context of distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.13(p7)
For example, criterion E of generalized anxiety disorder
states: "The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of function-
ing."13(p436)
Despite the prominence of clinical significance in
diagnostic criteria, there is currently no consensus as to
how it should be defined or operationalized. In large
epidemiologic surveys, direct clinical judgment is rarely
DETERMINING RATES OF CLINICALLY
SIGNIFICANT MENTAL DISORDERS
IN THE ECA AND NCS
To maximize comparability, comparisons between the ECA
and NCS were limited to the population aged 18 to 54 years.
As in previous analyses, we focused on 1-year prevalence and
used the single wave of data from the NCS and 2 waves of
data from the ECA to maximize case ascertainment.4 Preva-
lence rates of clinically significant disorders were deter-
mined by identifying the percentage of the population that
met all criteria for diagnosis, including clinical significance.
The ECA disorders with symptom-level assessment of clini-
cal significance did not need revisions. To determine rates
of clinically significant disorders when questions were asked
for the syndrome as a whole, rather than symptom by symp-
tom, we considered a positive response to any of the ques-
tions (for the NCS life interference question, "a lot") to in-
dicate a clinically significant syndrome. Standard errors were
calculated by Taylor series linearization19 and 95% confi-
dence intervals were constructed. Table 1 summarizes the
revisions to the diagnostic variables that were necessary for
limiting cases to those with clinical significance.
Because no diagnostic algorithm was available for bi-
polar II disorder in the NCS, it was constructed de novo. We
also created a past-year prevalence rate for the ECA's diag-
nosis of dysthymia. This rate is likely to be an overestimate,
since persons with lifetime histories of both major depres-
sion and dysthymia were asked in the ECA to date only their
most recent depressive "spell," whether it was due to dys-
thymia or major depression.
To approximate nontransient conditions of cognitive
impairment in the ECA, such as dementia and mental re-
tardation, respondents were selected who met criteria for
"definite" or "possible" severe cognitive impairment at both
waves of interviews. Assuming that proxy interviews were
due to cognitive impairment in the respondent, persons with
definite or possible severe cognitive impairment at wave 1
and a proxy interview at wave 2 were also chosen.
For DSM-III alcohol abuse, impairment in function-
ing was a required criterion. The DIS assessed this through
questions about school or job problems, arrests, family ob-
jections to drinking, and other social problems. The stan-
dard clinical significance questions were not asked. For al-
cohol dependence, DSM-III criterion A required either
pathological use or impairment in functioning. To esti-
mate a clinically significant rate of alcohol dependence in
the ECA, impairment in functioning was required whether
or not there was a pattern of pathological use.
In the NCS, previously published rates of substance use
disorders were based on "broad" definitions of disorder. For
the clinically significant rates of substance abuse and depen-
dence, the "narrow" definitions of disorder were used. The
narrowabusedefinitionrequiredmeetingabusecriteriawithin
the past year and having no history of substance depen-
dence. The narrow dependence definition required ever hav-
ing had a substance dependence disorder, having had symp-
toms in the past 12 months, and having had 3 or more
substance-related problems during the past year. Clinical sig-
nificance questions were asked in the NCS for both alcohol
and other drug use disorders. For these analyses, questions
were also taken from the UM-CIDI that most closely corre-
sponded to the alcohol-related impairment questions in the
DIS. If any one of the clinical significance or other impair-
ment questions was answered positively for the narrowly de-
fined substance use disorders, then the clinical significance
criterion was met.

To obtain revised prevalence rates for persons 55 years
or older, a group not interviewed in the NCS, rates in the
ECA were accepted if ECA rates for ages 18 to 54 years were
lower than NCS rates for that age group. If the NCS had
the lower rate, the NCS rate that would have been ob-
tained for the older age group was estimated by multiply-
ing the NCS rate for the younger group by the ratio be-
tween estimates for younger and older subjects in the ECA.
Finally, to obtain prevalence rates for all adults older than

used because of the high cost of clinical time and the
large number of subjects, so proxy measures are
used.14 The developers of the Diagnostic Interview
Schedule (DIS) used in the ECA, and the related Uni-
versity of Michigan version of the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview (UM-CIDI) used in the
NCS, placed structured questions in the interviews to
address the clinical significance of symptoms and
syndromes.15-17 With these questions, clinical signifi-
cance was assumed if the respondent's symptoms led
him or her to mention them to a doctor or other pro-
fessional, or if the symptoms interfered with his or her
everyday life, or if the respondent took medication for
the symptoms. Thus, clinical significance was related,
if imperfectly, to concepts of symptom prominence or
severity (and possibly the resulting distress), impair-
ment in functioning, and treatment (including self-
treatment) with medication.
The question arises, then, as to whether these ques-
tions, if applied to the existing prevalence estimates, will
produce more realistic rates for policy and service plan-
ning, and to what extent differences in clinical signifi-
cance affect prevalence differences between the ECA and
the NCS. This article presents revised prevalence esti-
mates of clinically significant mental disorders, with evi-
dence of their validity, as an initial attempt to address
these questions.
RESULTS
EFFECT OF THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
CRITERION ON PREVALENCE RATES
In both the ECA and the NCS, prevalence rates were re-
duced when the available clinical significance questions
were applied. For the NCS, these reductions were gen-
erally in the 30% to 40% range (Table 2). The largest
change in NCS prevalence was 50% for social phobia
(7.4% without the clinical significance questions and 3.7%
with the questions), and the smallest change was 18%
for generalized anxiety disorder (3.4% without the clini-
cal significance questions and 2.8% with the questions).
Overall prevalence rates for NCS "any mental disorder"
and "any disorder including substance use disorders" were
reduced by about one third when the clinical signifi-
cance questions were applied.
Changes to the ECA prevalence rates (Table 3)
were less striking than in the NCS, because for rela-
tively few disorders in the ECA was symptom informa-
tion collected independent of the clinical significance
questions. For example, there was no change in the
prevalence of anxiety disorders from previously pub-
lished rates because only clinically significant symp-
toms were included in the diagnostic algorithms. In
contrast, the prevalence of ECA unipolar major depres-

sion, for which clinical significance was asked at the
syndrome level, was reduced by 23% when clinical sig-
nificance questions were used, compared with a 39%
decrease in the NCS. Severe cognitive impairment and
drug use disorders among 18- to 54-year-olds in the
ECA showed large decreases in prevalence when clini-
cal significance data were applied. Table 3 also shows
that the previous usage of a lifetime estimate of dysthy-
mia without the clinical significance criterion grossly
inflated the previously published 1-year estimates for
any mood disorder in the ECA. The large reduction in
dysthymia prevalence contributed to a 44% reduction
in the rate of any mood disorder with clinical signifi-
cance compared with previously published rates. Over-
all, the ECA prevalence rates for any disorder and any
disorder including substance use disorders were
reduced by about 17% in the 18- to 54-year age range.
In the group aged 55 years and older in the ECA,
rates for mental disorders were generally lower than in
the 18- to 54-year-old group, particularly for substance
use disorders, panic disorder, and antisocial personality
disorder. As expected, rates were higher for severe cog-
nitive impairment in this age group. Overall, 15.2% of
persons older than 54 years had a clinically significant
mental disorder, and 17.3% had either a mental or sub-
stance use disorder. When age groups were combined
in the ECA, 17.2% of the adult population had a mental
disorder, and 22.5% had a mental or substance use dis-
order.
EFFECT OF THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
CRITERION ON ECA-NCS DISCREPANCIES
Comparisons between the 2 surveys are not straightfor-
ward because of their different methods for assessing
clinical significance. However, the 95% confidence
intervals in Tables 2 and 3 show that, after the clinical
significance criterion is applied, the NCS rates are usu-
ally the same or lower than the comparable ECA rates.
The exceptions to this are social phobia, which had a
significant change in criteria between DSM-III and
DSM-III-R and was assessed in a different manner in the
NCS, and bipolar disorder. Notably, differences in
major depression rates are not statistically significant
after the clinical significance criterion is applied,
although the ECA point estimates remain lower than
those of the NCS.
REVISED PREVALENCE ESTIMATES
USING DATA FROM BOTH SURVEYS
Table 4 shows the revised estimates of clinically sig-
nificant mental disorders. With the use of the conserva-
tive method of accepting the figure from the survey with
the lower prevalence estimate when both surveys cov-
ered the disorder, the NCS was chosen for the supraor-
dinate anxiety and substance use disorders categories, and
the ECA was chosen for mood disorders. When only 1
survey covered the disorder, its estimate was used, so gen-
eralized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress dis-
order were taken from the NCS; obsessive-compulsive
disorder, antisocial personality disorder, anorexia ner-
vosa, somatization disorder, and severe cognitive im-
pairment were taken from the ECA. For schizophreniaÂ­
nonaffective psychosis, we used the ECA estimate because
the NCS's unique clinical reassessment method was
applied to no other disorder in either survey. After ac-
counting for comorbidity and combining the chosen es-
timates, the overall revised 1-year prevalence rate for 18-
to 54-year-olds was 16.5% for any mental disorder not
including substance use disorders and 20.9% for any men-
tal or substance use disorder (Table 4). For all persons
older than 18 years, the overall prevalence of any men-
tal or substance use disorder was 18.5%, reflecting the
lower prevalence of disorders in persons older than 54
years.
SERVICE USE FOR MENTAL HEALTH
OR SUBSTANCE USE REASONS
The percentage of persons with a clinically significant
mental or addictive disorder who used services in the
health systems sector was remarkably similar for the ECA

and the NCS (Table 5). With the clinical significance
criterion in place, the ECA showed slightly higher over-
all rates of use in the general medical sector and lower
rates of use in the specialty mental and addictive sector
compared with the NCS. The major disparity in overall
use between the 2 surveys was among persons with mood
disorders because of differences in general medical use.
Compared with previous analyses of the 2 surveys that
did not use the clinical significance questions,6,7 service
use rates increased more for the NCS disorders than for
the ECA disorders when clinical significance was re-
quired. As expected given the nature of the clinical sig-
nificance questions, reported ambulatory service use was
significantly lower for those who met symptom criteria
without meeting the clinical significance criterion than
for those who met the clinical significance criterion.
INDICATORS OF VALIDITY
The usefulness of the clinical significance indicators was
evaluated by their association with suicidal ideas and be-
havior and indicators of disability (Table 6). Higher lev-
els of suicidal ideation and attempts were associated with
clinically significant disorders in both surveys for anxi-
ety disorders and unipolar major depression, but not for
substance use disorders. Indicators of disability (ie, re-
ceiving disability compensation and problems with work
in the past month) showed similar trends for anxiety
disorders and substance use disorders in the NCS.
Comorbidity between clinically significant and nonÂ­
clinically significant disorders may have obscured dif-
ferences in the validity comparisons. For example, fur-
ther analyses showed that half the persons in the NCS
whose substance use disorder did not meet the clinical
significance criterion had another disorder that was clini-
cally significant. In both surveys about one third of those
with a disorder that did not meet the clinical signifi-
cance criterion had a comorbid disorder that did.
COMMENT
The prevalence rates of mental and substance use disor-
ders were substantially reduced by using data generated
from the ECA and NCS clinical significance questions.
These revised rates represented a group of persons with
higher levels of disability and suicidal ideation than in
previous estimates, which we consider preliminary evi-
dence of the validity of the data. We also found a high
degree of comorbidity between clinically significant and
nonÂ­clinically significant syndromes. Discrepancies in
the rates of mood disorders between the ECA and the NCS,
a source of scientific controversy in the past, were brought

For anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and somatization disorder in the ECA, clinical significance was assessed at the symptom level, so rates without clinical
significance could not be determined. In the "before clinical significance" columns, rates for those disorders with clinical significance are included in italics, and are also
included in the rates of "any disorder" and "any disorder including substance use," to facilitate comparisons with previously published estimates (Regier et al6).
For dysthymia, clinical significance was assessed at the symptom level, so rates without clinical significance could not be determined. The rates presented in the
"before clinical significance" columns are lifetime rates, to facilitate comparisons with previously published estimates (Regier et al6).

significantly closer together with use of the clinical sig-
nificance data.
These analyses raise several methodologic issues. Al-
thoughwefoundsignificantdifferencesbetweenthosewho
met and did not meet clinical significance criteria as op-
erationalized by the developers of the DIS and the CIDI,
assessment methods need further study. For example, is it
preferabletoassessclinicalsignificanceatthesymptomlevel,
aswiththeECAanxietydisorders,oratthesyndromelevel,
as with the ECA and NCS mood disorders? Furthermore,
it is not yet clear whether survey questions assessing clini-
cal significance should be uniform across disorders, as in
the ECA and NCS, or tailored to distinctive clinical char-
acteristics and impairments of individual disorders. For ex-
ample, the degree and quality of life interference experi-
enced by persons with drug dependence will likely differ
on aggregate from the life interference experienced by per-
sons with social phobia. Such differences are not picked
up by the current clinical significance questions. The use-
fulness of global assessments of functioning and their re-
lationships to disorder-level assessments also need fur-
ther clarification.21
The ongoing experience of comparing and recon-
ciling the 2 surveys points out the importance of having
explicit criteria for all aspects of mental disorders, in-
cluding clinical significance, functional impairment, and
subjective distress. This methodologic work also points
out the complexity of community surveys of mental dis-
orders and the large effects that seemingly small modi-
fications can have on their results. It is not until these
changes are understood that we can have a good idea
whether rate differences are real or methodologic arti-
facts. It now appears that many of the differences in ECA
and NCS rates are due to differences in methods.
The policy implications of epidemiologic survey re-
sults continue to resonate as mental health systems, both
publicandprivate,struggletocompeteforshrinkinghealth
care dollars. Even relatively modest changes in the preva-
lence rate of mental disorders will have an impact on the
planning of service systems. For example, in this study the
change in overall prevalence of mental disorders from
29.6% in the ECA and 30.2% in the NCS, to 20.9% with
the use of our conservative point estimates represents a
decrease of about 13.3 million and 13.9 million Ameri-
cans, respectively. For all adults older than 18 years, the
revised estimate of 18.5% represents a decrease of about
19.2 million people from the ECA estimate of 28.0%. The
good news is that these lower numbers are likely to rep-
resent a group more needful of services. Unfortunately,
even when disorders are restricted to those with clinical
significance,theirnumbersarestilloverwhelmingforplan-
ning purposes. There are several unremediable sources of
imprecision in our current data, which, if remedied, might
haveproducedfurtherreductionsinprevalencerates.These
include the lifetime time frame of the DIS and UM-CIDI,
whichdoesnotallowforassessmentofthepresenceofeach
symptom in the past year. Similarly, the clinical signifi-
cance questions were asked only on a lifetime basis. In-
corporating more specific dating of this information would
probably reduce the prevalence rates, although at the ex-
penseofincreasedrespondentburden.Theimperfectspeci-
ficity of the diagnostic instruments likely also contrib-
utes to overestimates of true prevalence rates. Finally, the
clinical significance question about life and activity inter-
ference was different in the 2 surveys. The ECA used a di-
chotomous response option (yes [a lot] or no [not a lot])
and the NCS used a scaled response ("a lot," "some," "a
little," or "not at all"). Persons who answered yes to the
ECA question may have answered "some" if the NCS ques-
tion had been used, and therefore would not have met the
clinical significance criterion as we defined it.
As psychiatric epidemiology moves into its next gen-
eration, a major goal will therefore be to establish more

precise and clinically relevant prevalence estimates than
did the ECA and the NCS, the seminal surveys of this
generation. Several challenges lie ahead. First, the field
has progressed to a point where large, expensive "catch-
all" surveys will be replaced by surveys targeted to spe-
cific goals. Unmet treatment need is sure to be one goal;
causal and protective factors are sure to be another, but
the ideal design for one goal is not the same as that for
the other. Second, efforts to improve the validity of the
DIS and CIDI disorders should continue. Third, ad-
vances in the operationalization of disability constructs
and their translation into survey instruments should be
incorporated into research plans. Future population-
based surveys should include full assessments of
functioning and link level of functioning to the course
of mental disorders over time. The development and psy-
chometric testing of the second World Health Organi-
zation Disability Assessment Schedule for administra-
tion by lay interviewers holds promise in this regard.22,23
Further work also needs to be done in defining treat-
ment need, beyond current diagnostic notions. Persons
with subsyndromal psychiatric symptoms can have

significant disability and therefore may require treat-
ment.24-26 These subsyndromal cases represent persons
who may never meet disorder criteria, who may be in the
prodromal phase of a full-blown mental disorder, or who,
because of treatment or spontaneous remission, no longer
meet full criteria for a disorder.27 Longitudinal descrip-
tive and experimental studies would help clarify this het-
erogeneous group's characteristics and need for mental
health services. Very little is known about the clinical sig-
nificance and treatment needs for disorders that are not
currently included in epidemiologic surveys, such as most
personality disorders, adjustment disorders, and im-
pulse control disorders. In addition, estimates of treat-
ment refusal by those with clinically significant disor-
ders would be helpful to complete the picture of unmet
need. Finally, the lack of any definitive epidemiologic
study of the mental health needs of children in the United
States has been a hindrance. Estimates of treatment need
in this group vary widely, and all are based on limited
samples.28 The developmental consequences of childhood-
onset disorders, including their persistence into adult-
hood, are necessary to form a clinically and developmen-
tally sensitive epidemiology of mental disorders.
