Individuals labelled as having hypertension tend to
report poor self-rated health (SRH), but it is unclear
whether this association is independent of actual
hypertension, socioeconomic status and adiposity,
and extends across racial and ethnic groups. In a
cross-sectional study we compared hypertensive and
normotensive individuals (N ¼ 19 057) who varied in
whether they had ever been labelled hypertensive.
Blood pressure was measured in participants' homes
and mobile examination centres in the United States as
part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey, 1988­1994. The main outcome measure was
global SRH. Hypertensive labelling was associated with
poorer SRH and was independent of established SRH
predictors, antihypertensive medication use, body mass
index, and hypertension status (adjusted odds ratio
(OR) ¼ 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.61­1.99).
Hypertension was also associated with poorer SRH
(OR ¼ 1.26; 95% CI 1.09­1.46) but this association was
eliminated by adjustment for hypertensive labelling (OR
1.06; 95% CI 0.92­1.22). These effects were consistent
across non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and
Hispanic subgroups. Individuals labelled hypertensive
are more likely to have lower SRH and this labelling
effect predominates over that of actual hypertension.
Public health efforts to increase the number of indivi-
duals screened for high blood pressure may success-
fully detect the presence of hypertension but may also
reduce health-related quality of life as measured by
global SRH.

Introduction
Screening and detection of hypertension is an
enormous and important task. Hypertension is an
asymptomatic condition that affects 30% or more of
adults and strongly predicts risk of stroke, coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure and renal
failure.1,2 Many millions of hypertensive individuals
remain unaware of their condition3 and, in re-
sponse, public health guidelines recommend in-
creasing the proportion of adults screened for high
blood pressure.4 However, screening and detection
leads to the labelling of individuals as hypertensive
and such labelling may adversely affect some health
indices. For example, some studies show that
labelling increases work absenteeism5­7 while others
show that labelled hypertensives have lower self-
rated health (SRH) than normotensives.8­15 This
apparent SRH effect of labelling has been reported
in comparisons of labelled and unlabelled (unaware
hypertensive) persons11 and may occur in indivi-
duals mislabelled (i.e., normotensive persons mis-
diagnosed as hypertensive).9 Therefore, even though
screening and detection of hypertension is neces-
sary to prevent the complications of hypertension,
it may also adversely impact global SRH through
labelling effects.
The potential sensitivity of global self-health
ratings to hypertension labelling is particularly
important. First, SRH has a prominent role in
clinical investigation because subjective ratings of
health and well-being are considered to be primary
end points.16 Further, global SRH is an integrative
measure of health status that has established
criterion validity impacting major objective health
outcomes. For example, global SRH covaries with
functional ability,17,18 prospectively predicts physi-
cian use19 and mortality across socioeconomic
strata20 even after adjustment for objective dis-
ease.21­23 The predictive utility of SRH is in part

why it is routinely collected in public health
surveys.24 For example, the global SRH assessment
­ `How would you rate your health, poor, fair, good,
very good or excellent?' ­ is a benchmark for quality
of life in the national strategy for health promotion
in the US.4 In fact, the first goal of this effort `y is
to help individuals of all ages increase life expect-
ancy and improve their quality of life [emphasis
in original]' (p 20).4 Thus, quality of life on a
population level is operationally defined in part by
global self-health appraisals like those shown to be
sensitive to hypertension labelling.8,9,11­13,25 If blood
pressure screening and concomitant hypertensive
labelling reduce SRH, then success in some ele-
ments of public health promotion (blood pressure
screening and hypertension control) may erode
progress in others (quality of life), particularly for
those who are mislabelled.
Our understanding of the scope and character of
hypertensive labelling effects on SRH is limited for
several reasons. Prior studies have utilized clinic10,25
or otherwise restricted samples,9,12 enrolled unu-
sually hypertensive subgroups,25,26 lacked normo-
tensive controls,27 and/or did not covary potential
confounding factors such as antihypertensive treat-
ments,8 socioeconomic status,10,12,27 body mass
index (BMI),26,28 and concurrent chronic disease.10,25
Population-based studies with adequate controls
were either small11,13 or lacked independent blood
pressure measurements,8,15 and none have enrolled
sufficient numbers of racial/ethnic subgroups to
evaluate the consistency of labelling effects across
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and
Hispanic subpopulations. Finally, in order to
distinguish labelling effects from the effects of
hypertension status it is necessary to examine large
samples including hypertensive and normotensive
individuals, both labelled and unlabelled (or mis-
labelled, as the case may be).
The present study evaluated hypertension label-
ling effects on global SRH in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III),29,30 a large, ethnically diverse, prob-
ability sample of US residents. These data contain
detailed demographic assessments, medical his-
tories, as well as objective measurements of physical
characteristics including blood pressure and BMI.
Its large scope (over 19 000 adult participants)
provides a unique opportunity to address labelling
effects independent of actual blood pressure levels,
antihypertensive treatment and potential confound-
ing factors. This disaggregation of measured blood
pressure from hypertension labelling permits eva-
luation of the relative impact of risk labelling and
actual health risk status. We tested the following
hypotheses: (1) Is hypertensive labelling associated
with poor SRH?, (2) Is hypertension status (actual
blood pressure) associated with poor SRH?, (3) Is the
effect of hypertensive labelling similar among normo-
tensives and hypertensives?, and (4) Are these
relations consistent across racial/ethnic groups?
Materials and methods
NHANES III utilizes a complex, stratified multistage
sampling design that represents the civilian non-
institutionalized population of the US.30 Blacks,
older adults, and Mexican­Americans were over-
sampled. Participants were interviewed in their
home in English or Spanish by NHANES staff, and
following the interview physical measurements
were obtained by a trained health professional.
Additional blood pressure measurements were
obtained for most (80%) participants by a board-
eligible physician during a second physical exam at
a mobile examination centre. The second assess-
ments took place within 4 weeks of the home
interview.
Blood pressure was measured with a mercury
sphygmomanometer using protocols established by
the American Heart Association. Household and
mobile examination centre examiners initially re-
ceived a day and a half of blood pressure measure-
ment training, were recertified quarterly and
retrained annually.29
Of the 20 050 participants in the adult survey
(17­90 þ years old), we restricted our analyses to
those 18 years and over (N ¼ 19 618) who had at
least one valid blood pressure measurement
and responded to the question about previously dia-
gnosed hypertension (N ¼ 19 057; 97% of those X18
years old). All participants provided informed
consent for both the home and mobile examination
centre evaluations. The data used for this study are
publicly available from the US National Center for
Health Statistics.
Measures
Sociodemographic characteristics. We used sev-
eral sociodemographic variables as covariates in all
analyses. They included age (in seven categories;
18­24, 25­34, 35­44, 45­54, 55­64, 65­74, 75 þ
years), gender, education (in five categories; 0­9,
10­11, 12, 12­15, 16 or more years), annual house-
hold income (approximate quartiles in US dollars;
0­$12 999; $13 000­$19 999; $20 000­$34 999;
$35 000 þ ), race/ethnicity (three dummy codes
to represent non-Hispanic white (N ¼ 8121), non-
Hispanic black (N ¼ 5243), Mexican-American
(N ¼ 4965), and `other' race/ethnicity categories
(N ¼ 728)). Approximately 10% of household in-
come responses were missing. Rather than reducing
our sample via casewise deletion, missing income
values were imputed using age, education, gender,
ethnicity, and smoking status. The direction and
significance of analyses were insensitive to this
imputation, so we retained the imputed income
variable for all analyses.
Health characteristics. BMI was calculated as
weight in kg/height in m2. Measurements were
obtained by physical examination. We created five
BMI categories as follows: underweight (BMI

o18.5), normal (BMI 18.5­24.9); overweight (BMI
25­29.9) obese (BMI 30­39.9) and extreme obesity
(BMIX40).31 Four dummy codes were used to
represent these five categories. The number of
physician visits in the last 12 months (during the
past 12 months, about how many times did you
see or talk to a medical doctor or assistant?) were
recoded into four categories (none, 1, 2, 3, or more).
Physician visits are higher among labelled normo-
tensives and may explain differences in health
perceptions.32 Chronic disease was assessed by the
self-reported presence or absence of cancer, stroke,
heart attack, and diabetes. Smoking status was
coded as never, former, or current. A very small
number (o0.5%) of missing values for health
characteristics were imputed using age, gender,
ethnicity, education, household income, and smok-
ing status. Analyses were insensitive to these
imputations so we report statistics using the 19 057
adult participants described above.
Hypertensive status and hypertensive label status.
We created a binary hypertension status variable
(hypertension if systolic blood pressure (SBP)X140
or diastolic blood pressure (DBP)X90; otherwise
normotensive) based upon the average of blood
pressure readings obtained during the home and
mobile examination centre exams. In over 80% of
participants this average was derived from six blood
pressure measurements across the two sessions, and
over 99% of the sample had at least three readings
from one session. A binary hypertension label
variable was created based upon each participant's
answer to the question `Have you ever been told by a
doctor or other health professional that you had
hypertension, also called high blood pressure?'
These two variables were used to create a 2 Â 2
matrix from which specific pairwise comparisons
were conducted (see Table 1). A final binary variable
representing current prescription medication use for
hypertension was available for 3999 of the 5305
participants who reported being labelled as having
hypertension.
Statistical analyses
The primary dependent variable was SRH, assessed
with the question `Would you say your health in
general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?'
Since SRH is an ordered categorical variable, we
used an ordinal regression model, the cumulative
odds model33,34 to evaluate differences in SRH as a

function of hypertension status and labelling. This
model, an extension of logistic regression, provides
odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
that summarize the predictive association over all
possible binary SRH cutpoints.34,35 All ordinal
regressions reported below controlled for socio-
demographic variables, comorbid diseases, smoking,
BMI, and accounted for the complex survey design.
Analyses were conducted using Stata 8.2 (Stata
Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Across all participants, those labelled as hyperten-
sive were 1.79 times more likely to have poorer
SRH than unlabelled persons (95% CI 1.61­1.99,
Po0.001). This association was not affected by
adjustment for blood pressure (OR ¼ 1.77; 95% CI
1.59­1.97, Po0.001) and was appreciably stronger
than the association with low household income
(OR ¼ 1.26; 95% CI 1.20­1.33) and low education
(OR ¼ 1.43; 95% CI 1.37­1.50). Hypertension status
based upon measured blood pressure was also
associated with poorer SRH (OR ¼ 1.26; 95% CI
1.09­1.46, Po0.01), but this association was elimi-
nated by adjusting for hypertensive labelling
(OR ¼ 1.06; 95% CI 0.92­1.22, P ¼ 0.40). Among
normotensives, those labelled as hypertensive were
1.79 (95% CI 1.57­2.04, Po0.001) times more likely
to have poorer SRH, an association that was
unaffected by controlling for blood pressure. Indi-
viduals with normal measured blood pressure but
who had been labelled as hypertensive include
persons with controlled hypertension (i.e., on
treatment) and persons mislabelled (i.e., `false
positives'). To examine the effects of mislabelling
among normotensives, we identified the subset of
labelled normotensives who were not receiving
antihypertensive medication (N ¼ 391) and com-
pared them to unlabelled normotensives. Among
unmedicated normotensives the presence of a label
was strongly associated with poorer SRH (OR ¼ 2.01;
95% CI 1.37­2.94, P ¼ 0.001).
Among those with high blood pressure, labelled
individuals were also more likely to report poorer
SRH than unlabelled individuals (OR 1.70; 95% CI
1.42­2.03, Po0.001). This association was un-
affected by adjustment for blood pressure (OR 1.68;
95% CI 1.38­2.04, Po0.001) and persisted when the
analysis was restricted to hypertensive individuals
not receiving hypertensive medication (OR 1.88;
95% CI 1.50­2.34, Po0.001). Finally, we repeated
these analyses within the three racial/ethnic groups.
The pattern of poorer SRH for labelled individuals
was consistent for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispa-
nic blacks, and Mexican­Americans, while SRH was
insensitive to actual hypertension status when
labelling was controlled (see Figure 1). This pattern
was also observed within normotensive and hyper-
tensive participants (see Figure 2). Similar patterns
were observed for men and women separately (data
not shown).
Discussion
We found a consistent and substantial association
between hypertension labelling and lower SRH in
a large, ethnically diverse sample representative of
the US population. Individuals with hypertensive
labels had consistently higher odds of poorer self-
health ratings compared to individuals not so
labelled. This relation persisted when comparing

normotensives who differed only in their label
status, that is, likely false positives (those who were
labelled but normotensive without medication)
versus true normotensives. Labelling effects were
insensitive to actual hypertensive status and,
furthermore, hypertensive status based on measured
blood pressure did not predict SRH independently
of labelling. The labelling effects we observed were
not explained by concurrent chronic disease, having
more contact with the health care system/medical
providers, or medication use. Further, these associa-
tions were consistently of a larger magnitude than
factors such as education and income, and were
observed across non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Mexican-American subpopulations.
These data suggest that efforts to increase hyperten-
sion screening and awareness may inadvertently but
broadly undermine other health benchmarks, that is,
health-related quality of life as measured by global
SRH.4,24
This work contributes to the literature in several
ways. First, we replicated a number of similar
studies testing labelling effects.9­14,25 Second, we
extended this work by showing that labelling effects
on SRH are independent of potential confounding
by known SRH predictors, such as concurrent
chronic disease,36 SES,37 and BMI. Since high BMI
is associated with hypertension and poorer SRH,
it is an especially potent rival hypothesis for
labelling effects.38,39 Third, the NHANES data
provide multiple blood pressure measurements to
define hypertensive status, reducing the possibility
of misclassification error.40 In addition, the rigorous
training of examiners likely provided more reliable
blood pressure measurement than those obtained in
typical hospital or clinic settings.41,42 Finally, the
sample was substantially larger than in previous
reports and representative of the adult US popula-
tion, reinforcing findings from other population-
based studies showing adverse hypertensive label-
ling effects on quality of life.13,15
To the extent that a hypertensive label negatively
affects SRH, among truly hypertensive individuals
this is offset by the health benefits of subsequent
antihypertensive treatment. On the other hand,
normotensive persons mislabelled as hypertensive
enjoy no such benefit. Based upon this population
sample, we estimate that 12.6% of normotensive
US adults are labelled as having hypertension.
Although most of these people are on antihyperten-
sive medication, some are mislabeled due to factors
such as blood pressure variability, poor measure-
ment technique and miscommunication. The poten-
tial for adverse labelling effects may be exacerbated
by recent guidelines which recommend labelling
those with lower blood pressure (i.e., 120­
139 mmHg SBP or 80­89 mmHg DBP) as prehyper-
tensive.1 In any case, the potential negative con-
sequences of mislabelling remain unaddressed in
public and private health screening initiatives.
Several limitations of the present work should be
considered. The cross-sectional design cannot ad-
dress the causal direction of this association, and we
relied upon self-reports to assess prior hypertension
diagnosis (i.e., labelling). However, error in these
reports would probably bias the analyses towards
the null hypothesis. Looking ahead, longitudinal
studies could prospectively document the effects of
hypertensive labelling on SRH, and also assess
whether such labelling affects clinical outcomes.
In this regard, one prospective study found that the
adverse effects of labelling on SRH were limited to
those taking medication 1 year postlabelling.27
However, that report was based upon hypertensive
participants enrolled in a clinical trial of blood
pressure treatment. Other SRH predictors were
uncontrolled in the analyses and, in general,
participants in clinical trials often report gains in

What is known on this topic
Hypertension screening is part of health promotion and disease
prevention programmes in industrialized countries.
Individuals labelled as having hypertension tend to report low
health-related quality of life but this association could be due to
other sociodemographic and health risk factors.
What this study adds
Hypertension labelling, but not high blood pressure, is associated
with poorer self-rated health in a diverse US population sample.
This association persisted after adjustment for socioeconomic
status, body mass index, and self-reported hypertension
medication use and was observed within non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic subpopulations.
Hypertension screening and subsequent labelling may have broad
adverse effects on global self-rated health.

SRH probably resulting from the close medical care
that they receive. Although we would anticipate
different labelling outcomes among the general popu-
lation, such work may provide the antidote to
unwanted labelling effects ­ more intensive counsel-
ling and follow-up. It is possible that if clinicians
establish collaborative and empathic relationships
with hypertensive individuals the potential negative
effects of hypertensive labelling could be diminished.1
Trials in naturalistic settings using current hyperten-
sion guidelines can address this important question.
