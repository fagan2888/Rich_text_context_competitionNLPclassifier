Objective. Sugar-sweetened soft drinks contain large amounts of fructose, which may significantly increase serum uric
acid levels and the risk of gout. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between sugar-sweetened soft drink intake,
diet soft drink intake, and serum uric acid levels in a nationally representative sample of men and women.
Methods. Using data from 14,761 participants age >20 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (1988­1994), we examined the relationship between soft drink consumption and serum uric acid levels using
linear regression. Additionally, we examined the relationship between soft drink consumption and hyperuricemia (serum
uric acid level >7.0 mg/dl for men and >5.7 mg/dl for women) using logistic regression. Intake was assessed by a
food-frequency questionnaire.
Results. Serum uric acid levels increased with increasing sugar-sweetened soft drink intake. After adjusting for covari-
ates, serum uric acid levels associated with sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption categories (<0.5, 0.5­0.9, 1­3.9, and
>4 servings/day) were greater than those associated with no intake by 0.08, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.42 mg/dl, respectively (95%
confidence interval 0.11, 0.73; P < 0.001 for trend). The multivariate odds ratios for hyperuricemia according to the
corresponding sweetened soft drink consumption levels were 1.01, 1.34, 1.51, and 1.82, respectively (P  0.003 for trend).
Diet soft drink consumption was not associated with serum uric acid levels or hyperuricemia (multivariate P > 0.13 for
trend).
Conclusion. These findings from a nationally representative sample of US adults suggest that sugar-sweetened soft drink
consumption is associated with serum uric acid levels and frequency of hyperuricemia, but diet soft drink consumption
is not.
INTRODUCTION
Hyperuricemia is considered the precursor of gout,
which is the most common inflammatory arthritis for
adult men (1). The doubling of the prevalence (2) and
incidence (3) of gout in the US over the last few decades
(4) coincided with a substantial increase in soft drink
and fructose consumption (5). For example, soft drink
consumption in the US increased by 61% in adults from
1977­1997 (5), and sugar-sweetened soft drinks repre-
sent the largest single food source of calories in the US
diet (5,6). Conventional dietary recommendations for
gout have focused on restriction of purine and alcohol
intake, but not on sugar-sweetened soft drink intake
(7,8). Although these soft drinks contain low purine
levels, they contain large amounts of fructose, which is
the only carbohydrate known to increase uric acid levels
(9­13). This led us to hypothesize that sugar-sweetened
soft drink consumption is positively associated with
serum uric acid levels, but that diet soft drink intake is
not. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-
sectional study based on the US Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III) (14,
15). In addition, we examined whether the intake of
orange juice, a common source of naturally occurring
fructose, was associated with serum uric acid levels in
this study.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study population. Conducted between 1988 and 1994,
the NHANES-III included a representative sample of the
noninstitutionalized civilian US population, which was
selected by using a multistage, stratified sampling design
(14). After a home interview, participants were invited to
attend examination sessions where blood and urine spec-
imens were obtained. For participants unable to attend the
examination for health reasons, a blood sample was
obtained during the home interview. Our analysis was
limited to participants age 20 years who attended the
medical examination, and only included the 14,761 par-
ticipants (6,906 men and 7,855 women) with complete
information. We repeated our analyses among 14,317 par-
ticipants after excluding those who self-reported gout or
were taking allopurinol or uricosuric agents (n  444).
In addition, we analyzed the NHANES-III Supplemental
Nutrition Survey (SNS) of Older Americans (16), because
total fructose intake was estimated only in this subpopu-
lation. The NHANES-III SNS was conducted to estimate
usual dietary intake in a sample of older subjects (age 50
years), and to identify the characteristics that influence
dietary survey collection. Our analysis of these data was
limited to the 2,570 participants with complete informa-
tion.
Uric acid measurement. Serum uric acid levels were
measured by oxidization with the specific enzyme uricase
to form allantoin and H2
O2
(Hitachi Model 737 Multichan-
nel Analyzer; Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, India-
napolis, IN). Details about quality-control procedures have
been published elsewhere (15). Values are reported in
milligrams per deciliter; to convert to micromoles per liter,
multiply by 59.48.
Assessment of sweetened soft drink and diet soft drink
intake. During the home interview, intakes of sugar-
sweetened soft drinks, diet soft drinks, and orange juice
were determined from responses to the food-frequency
questionnaire that was administered to participants to as-
sess their usual consumption over the prior month. Food-
frequency questionnaire assessment of dietary intake has
been shown to be a valid and reliable method for assessing
average dietary consumption (17,18).
Assessment of covariates. The average daily intakes of
total meat, seafood, and dairy foods were derived from
responses to the food-frequency questionnaire (19,20). In-
take of total energy and fructose was calculated from a
24-hour dietary recall. Total caffeine intake was calculated
using US Department of Agriculture food composition
sources (21). We estimated that the caffeine content of the
individual beverages was 137 mg/cup of coffee, 47 mg/cup
of tea, and 46 mg/bottle or can of cola beverage (21,22).
The NHANES-III collected information on body measure-
ments (including height and weight), medication use
(including diuretics, antihypertensives, allopurinol, and
uricosuric agents), medical conditions (including self-
reported hypertension and gout), and serum creatinine
levels. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by
using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
study equation (23­25):
GFR (ml/minute per 1.73 m2)  186 
(serum creatinine level [mg/dl])1.154 
(age)0.203  [0.742, if female] 
[1.212, if African American]
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing a par-
ticipant's weight in kilograms by the square of their height
in meters.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were com-
puted using survey commands of Stata statistical software
(e.g., svymean and svyreg; Stata Corporation, College Sta-
tion, TX) to incorporate sample weights and adjust for
clusters and strata of the complex sampling design.
We used linear regression modeling to evaluate the re-
lationship between beverage and fructose intake and se-
rum uric acid level. Sweetened and diet soft drink con-
sumption were each categorized into 5 groups of average
daily servings: 0, 0.5, 0.5­0.9, 1­3, and 4 servings/day.
Fructose intake in the NHANES-III SNS was categorized
into 4 groups: 10, 10­49.9, 50­74.9, and 75 gm/day.
These cut-points were chosen, considering the distribu-
tion of the data, to ensure sufficient sample size for each
category according to the Analytic and Reporting Guide-
lines of the NHANES-III (26). Multivariate models for sug-
ar-sweetened soft drink consumption were adjusted for
age; sex; smoking status; total energy intake; BMI; use of
diuretics, beta-blockers, allopurinol, and uricosuric
agents; self-reported hypertension; GFR; and intake of
meat, seafood, dairy foods, coffee, tea, total caffeine, diet
soft drinks, and orange juice. Multivariate models for fruc-
tose intake were adjusted for the same variables, except for
intake of diet soft drinks and orange juice. Trends in serum
uric acid levels across categories of intake were assessed in
linear regression models by using the median values of
each category to minimize the influence of outliers. We
also performed logistic regression with a dichotomous out-
come of hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level 7.0 mg/dl
in men and 5.7 mg/dl in women) (15), adjusting for the
same covariates. We examined the potential impact of an
alternative definition of hyperuricemia (serum uric acid
level 6.0 mg/dl regardless of sex) in these regression
models.
We explored potential interactions by sex, age group
(60 years versus 60 years), BMI (25 kg/m2 versus 25
kg/m2), and alcohol use (abstainer versus drinker) by test-
ing the significance of interaction terms added to our final
multivariate models. For all difference estimates and odds
ratios (ORs), we calculated 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs). All P values were 2-sided.
RESULTS
Characteristics. The population's mean age was 45
years. The mean serum uric acid level was 5.32 mg/dl
(6.05 mg/dl in men and 4.63 mg/dl in women) and 18%

were hyperuricemic (19% of men and 17% of women).
The relevant characteristics according to sweetened soft
drink, diet soft drink, and orange juice intake are shown in
Table 1. With increasing sweetened soft drink intake, meat
intake and the proportion of men tended to increase, but
age and frequency of hypertension and diuretic use tended
to decrease. With increasing diet soft drink intake, BMI
and frequency of hypertension tended to increase. With
increasing orange juice intake, dairy intake tended to in-
crease.
Serum uric acid levels and sweetened soft drink, diet
soft drink, and orange juice intake. Serum uric acid level
increased with increasing sweetened soft drink intake, as
shown in Table 2 and Figure 1. After adjusting for age,
BMI, sex, and nondietary variables, serum uric acid levels
associated with sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption
categories (0.5, 0.5­0.9, 1­3, and 4 servings/day) were
greater than the levels associated with no intake by 0.12,
0.20, 0.38, and 0.45 mg/dl, respectively (95% CI 0.18, 0.71;
P  0.001 for trend). After further adjusting for dietary
variables, the differences were slightly attenuated but re-
mained significant (P  0.001 for trend). In contrast, diet
soft drink intake was inversely associated with serum uric
acid levels after adjusting for age, BMI, sex, and nondietary
variables (P  0.001 for trend) (Table 2). After additionally
adjusting for dietary variables, the inverse association was
attenuated and became insignificant (P  0.13 for trend).
There was a modest association between increasing orange
juice intake and serum uric acid levels (Table 2). After
adjusting for covariates, serum uric acid levels in individ-
uals with orange juice intake 1 serving/day were greater
than those with no intake by 0.17 mg/dl (95% CI 0.01,
0.34; P  0.009 for trend) (Table 2).
The results of logistic regression with hyperuricemia as
a dichotomous outcome were similar. The multivariate
ORs for hyperuricemia according to sugar-sweetened soft
drink consumption categories (0.5, 0.5­0.9, 1­3, and 4
servings/day) as compared with no intake were 1.01, 1.34,
1.51, and 1.82, respectively (P  0.003 for trend). In con-
trast, diet soft drink consumption was not associated
with hyperuricemia (P  0.46 for trend). The multivar-
iate OR for hyperuricemia according to orange juice
consumption categories (0.5, 0.5­0.9, and 1 serving/
day) as compared with those with no use were 1.12, 1.30,
and 1.39, respectively (P  0.005 for trend). An alternative
definition of hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level 6.0
mg/dl, regardless of sex) did not materially alter these
results.
Serum uric acid level according to sex, age group, BMI,
and alcohol use. We also conducted stratified analyses to
evaluate whether the association between sweetened soft
drink consumption and serum uric acid level varied ac-
cording to sex, age group, BMI, and alcohol use (Figure 2).
There was no significant interaction with these variables
(P for interaction 0.1) except for sex (P for interaction 
0.001) (Figure 2). The multivariate differences for soft
drink consumption categories (0.5, 0.5­0.9, 1­3, and 4
servings/day) were 0.15, 0.21, 0.40, and 0.52 mg/dl, re-
spectively, for men (P for interaction 0.001) and 0.04,

Fructose intake and serum uric acid levels in the
NHANES-III SNS. Among the participants of the NHANES-
III SNS (age 50 years; n  2,570), increasing fructose
intake was associated with increasing serum uric acid
levels. After adjusting for all covariates, serum uric acid
levels associated with fructose consumption categories
(10­49.9, 50­74.9, and 75 gm/day [the latter being
equivalent to 5 cans of cola/day]) were greater than those
associated with 10 gm/day by 0.05, 0.43, and 0.88 mg/dl,
respectively (95% CI 0.24, 1.53; P  0.003 for trend). The
multivariate ORs for hyperuricemia according to the cor-
responding fructose consumption levels were 1.03, 2.05,
and 4.11, respectively (P  0.003 for trend).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative sample of US men and
women, we found that serum uric acid levels significantly
increased with increasing sugar-sweetened soft drink in-
take. The association was independent of dietary and other
risk factors for hyperuricemia such as age, sex, BMI, alco-
hol use, renal function, hypertension, and diuretic use.
The association persisted across subgroups stratified by
sex, age, BMI, and alcohol use, and it tended to be greater
in men. We also found a modest association with orange
juice intake. In contrast, there was no significant associa-
tion between diet soft drink consumption and serum uric
acid level.
The difference in serum acid level between the extreme
categories of sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption was
0.4 mg/dl. This magnitude of a population mean difference
in serum uric acid level (20,27) can be translated into a
clinically relevant difference in the risk for incident gout,
as demonstrated in our previous studies (19,28). For ex-
ample, an increase of 1 daily serving in beer intake was
associated with a mean serum uric acid level increase of
0.4 mg/dl in a cross-sectional analysis of the NHANES-III
participants (19), and with a 50% increased risk of inci-
dent gout in our prospective analysis of the Health Profes-
sionals Follow-Up Study (27). This potentially significant
impact on the eventual risk of gout is also supported by
our results using hyperuricemia as a dichotomous out-
come, and when using various definitions for hyperurice-
mia.
Sugar-sweetened soft drinks contain large amounts of
fructose from added sugars, whereas orange juice and
other sweet fruit juices contain naturally occurring fruc-
tose. Fructose induces uric acid production by increasing
ATP degradation to AMP, a uric acid precursor (4,9,29­
31). Fructose phosphorylation in the liver uses ATP, and
the accompanying phosphate depletion limits regenera-
tion of ATP from ADP, which in turn serves as a substrate
for the catabolic pathway to uric acid formation (32). Thus,
within minutes after fructose infusion, plasma (and later
urinary) uric acid concentrations increase (9). In conjunc-
tion with purine nucleotide depletion, rates of purine syn-
thesis de novo are accelerated, thus potentiating uric acid
production (33). In contrast, glucose and other simple
sugars do not have this effect (13). Furthermore, fructose
could indirectly increase serum uric acid levels and the
risk of gout by increasing insulin resistance and circulat-
ing insulin levels (34). Both experimental studies in ani-
mal models and short-term feeding trials among humans
Figure 1. Multivariate adjusted serum uric acid levels according to categories of A, sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption, and B, diet
soft drink consumption. Error bars indicate standard errors. Serum uric acid levels are adjusted for the same covariates included in the final
multivariate model in Table 2. Data are presented incorporating sample weights and adjusted for clusters and strata of the complex sample
design of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Soft Drinks and Uric Acid 113
suggest that higher fructose intake contributes to insulin
resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperinsulin-
emia (35­38).
There are important practical implications of our re-
sults. It was over 100 years ago that Osler prescribed diets
low in fructose as a means to prevent gout (13). In his 1893
text (39) he wrote, "The sugar should be reduced to a
minimum. The sweeter fruits should not be taken" (13).
However, conventional dietary recommendations for gout
have focused on restriction of purine intake, although
low-purine diets are often high in carbohydrates, includ-
ing fructose-rich foods (7). Our data provide evidence that
fructose poses a substantial risk for hyperuricemia, thus
supporting the validity and importance of Osler's ap-
proach. Furthermore, because fructose intake is associated
with increased serum insulin levels, insulin resistance,
and adiposity (35­38,40,41), the overall negative health
impact from fructose is expected to be larger in gout pa-
tients, who often have the metabolic syndrome (63%) (42)
and are overweight (71%) (43). Conversely, the conven-
tional low-purine diet approach that allows fructose con-
sumption may have contributed to the high prevalence of
the metabolic syndrome observed in cross-sectional stud-
ies (42,44,45). Our findings support the importance of
reducing fructose intake in dietary recommendations for
hyperuricemia in order to reduce the patient's serum uric
acid levels, as well as to improve long-term outcomes.
We found that the increase in serum uric acid level
associated with sugar-sweetened soft drink intake tended
to be larger among men than women. This could be due to
differences in sex hormones. Studies in rats have shown
that female sex hormones protect against the development
of hyperinsulinemia associated with high fructose intake
(46­48). Because hyperinsulinemia results in decreased
renal excretion of urate and correlates with higher serum
uric acid levels (49­51), the protective effect of estrogen
may lead to an attenuated effect of fructose on serum uric
acid levels. Confirmation of these findings by future stud-
ies would allow more refined dietary recommendations for
both men and women with hyperuricemia or gout.
The strengths and limitations of our study deserve com-
ment. This study was performed in a nationally represen-
tative sample of US women and men; thus, the findings are
likely to be generalizable to the US adult population. As
opposed to prospective studies, a cross-sectional study
design tends to leave uncertainty regarding the temporal
sequence of exposure­outcome relations, and is also vul-
nerable to recall bias. For example, if some participants
switched their alcohol consumption to nonalcoholic bev-
erages based on previously identified gout or hyperurice-
mia before the NHANES study, the previous alcohol effect
might theoretically lead to a positive association with the
nonalcoholic beverages. However, exclusion of individu-
als with self-reported, lifetime history of physician-diag-
nosed gout, or of those who were taking medications to
treat hyperuricemia, did not materially alter our results.
Furthermore, the fact that the positive association existed
with sugar-sweetened soft drinks but not with diet soft
drinks argues against this potential scenario. Given the
absence of existing conventional recommendations on soft
drink consumption for hyperuricemia and gout, it is un-
likely that some participants changed their sweetened or
diet soft drink intake based on previously identified hy-
peruricemia or gout. In the NHANES-III, the health exam-
ination component including serum uric acid measure-
ment (outcome) was performed after the household
interview that inquired about intake of these beverages
during the past month (exposure). Thus, it appears im-
plausible that the serum uric acid levels measured in this
study would somehow systematically influence the re-
ported intake of these beverages. Similarly, differential
effects between the beverages would not be explained by
these potential methodologic limitations.
In conclusion, our results suggest that sugar-sweetened
soft drink intake is associated with a higher level of uric
acid and frequency of hyperuricemia, but that diet soft
drink intake is not. Furthermore, orange juice intake may
also be associated with a higher level of serum uric acid.
These data support strategies to reduce fructose consump-
tion in the dietary recommendations for individuals with
hyperuricemia and gout.
