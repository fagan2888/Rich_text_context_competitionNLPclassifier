Introduction
Obesity and smoking are the leading preventable causes of
morbidity and mortality in the United States (1). In fact, an
overweight smoker's life expectancy is, on average, 13 years
shorter than a normal weight nonsmoker's life expectancy (2).
The associations between obesity and smoking are complex. In
general, smoking is associated with lower body weight (3­6). It
is hypothesized that smoking lowers body weight set-point (7),
which leads to increased energy expenditure until the nicotine-
induced set-point is achieved (8). In addition, smoking gener-
ally extends satiety, which may decrease between-meal snacking
and caloric intake (7). An alternative hypothesis is that smoking
delays the usual age-related weight gain (9,10). Smokers' body
weight also may vary depending on frequency of smoking and
socioeconomic status. It has been shown that individuals who
smoke heavily are typically more overweight than light smok-
ers (11­13) and lower socioeconomic status is associated with
increased likelihood of being overweight (14). Finally, although
on-going smoking may be related to lower body weight, smok-
ing cessation is often followed by weight gain (3,15).
To our knowledge, this is the first report to compare the
prevalence of obesity in smokers seeking treatment as part of
a smoking cessation trial with a general population sample of
never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers. This will
illuminatewhetherthemostat-risksmokers,thosewithcomor-
bid obesity, are especially likely, or unlikely, to volunteer for
cessation treatment. In addition, it is important to characterize
the nature of the risk posed by the concurrent risk factors of
obesity and smoking. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to
compare the prevalence of obesity and other health character-
istics among treatment-seeking smokers using participants in
the Wisconsin Smokers' Health Study (WSHS), with a 
general
population of smokers participating in the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005­2006.
Methods and Procedures
From the study's total sample of 1,504 smokers, 1,428 subjects with
complete baseline BMI, smoking, and demographic characteristics
from the WSHS were selected. These individuals, aged 20­85, are
currently completing the follow-up segment of a smoking cessation
clinical trial conducted in Madison and Milwaukee, WI, that began

Obesity and smoking represent the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States.
This study compared the prevalence of obesity among smokers seeking cessation treatment (n = 1,428) vs. a
general population (n = 4,081) of never smokers, former smoker, and current smokers. Data from treatment-seeking
smokers in the Wisconsin Smokers' Health Study (WSHS) and individuals who completed the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005­2006 were pooled and obesity rates and other health characteristics
were compared. The prevalence of obesity was significantly higher among WSHS treatment-seeking smokers
(36.8%) vs. NHANES current smokers (29.6%), but the obesity rates of WSHS treatment-seeking smokers did not
differ from NHANES former smokers (36.5%) or never smokers (36.5%). Treatment-seeking smokers were more
likely to be female and to have higher educational attainment compared to NHANES participants. Analysis of health
characteristics revealed that treatment-seeking smokers had higher levels of dietary fiber and vitamin C and lower
blood levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose compared to NHANES current smokers. Results
suggest that treatment-seeking smokers may have a different health profile than current smokers in the general
population. Health care providers should be aware of underlying heath issues, particularly obesity, in patients seeking
smoking cessation treatment.

Epidemiology
in 2005. Adult smokers were recruited via television, radio and

newspaper advertisements, flyers, earned media including press con-
ferences, and television and radio news interviews. Inclusion criteria
included smoking >9 cigarettes per day on average for at least the past
6 months and being motivated to quit smoking. Exclusion criteria
included using any noncigarette form of tobacco, currently taking
bupropion, medical contraindications for any of the study medica-
tions (bupropion, nicotine patch, or nicotine lozenge), high alcohol
consumption (6 drinks per day on 6 or 7 days of the week), history of
seizure, schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder, an eating dis
order,
a recent cardiac event, or allergies to the medications. (M.E. Piper,
S.S. Smith, T.R. Schlam et al, unpublished data).
To compare treatment-seeking smokers with a general 
population
of smokers, we selected participants, age 20, from the NHANES
2005­2006 data set. The NHANES 2005­2006 is a complex, multi-
stage probability sample of the noninstitutionalized population of
the United States. Certain population subgroups were oversampled,
including adolescents aged 12­19 years, African Americans, and
Mexican Americans, to allow for precise estimates from each group.
From the NHANES sample with complete data for BMI, smoking, and
demographic 
characteristics (n = 4,081), we identified three classes
of smokers: never smokers (n = 2,371), former smokers (n = 1,122),
and current smokers (n = 588, defined as smoking >10 cigarettes per
day). Thus the combined NHANES and WSHS final sample (n = 5,509)
included 4,081 individuals (never, former, and current smokers) from
the NHANES sample and 1,428 treatment-seeking smokers from the
WSHS sample.
For both the WSHS and the NHANES samples, BMI was calculated
using participants' clinically measured weight and height (kg/m2). A
BMI of <18.5 was classified as underweight, a BMI of 18.5­24.9 was
classified as normal weight, a BMI of 25.0­29.9 as overweight, and a
BMI of 30.0 as obese (16). Seventy-seven participants were classified
as underweight. Because these individuals made up a small proportion
of the total sample (1.4%), we combined these individuals with the
normal weight category.
In addition to BMI, we used demographic, dietary, blood lipids and
glucose, and smoking behavior variables collected from the WSHS and
NHANES to further compare health characteristics among the groups
of smokers.
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC), where standard descriptive statistics (mean or %) were used
to describe demographic, physical, and lifestyle variables. For signifi-
cance testing, 2-tests were used to compare categorical variables and
general linear models were used for continuous variables. An  of 0.05
was used to identify significant differences between treatment-seeking
smokers, current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers. This
study was approved by the University of Wisconsin­Madison Human
Subjects Institutional Review Board.
Results
Figure 1 shows that obesity was significantly more prevalent
among treatment-seeking smokers in the WSHS than current
smokers in the general population (36.8 vs. 29.6%, P < 0.0001).
Combined overweight/obesity rates in treatment-seeking
smokers were similar to NHANES never smokers (70.7 and
70.8%, respectively), while NHANES former smokers had the
highest rates (74.4%) and NHANES current smokers had the
lowest rates (58.5%).
Table 1 shows selected demographic, smoking, diet, and
biochemical characteristics among smokers in the WSHS and
NHANES samples. The majority of 
treatment-seeking 
smokers
was white/Caucasian (84%) and had a higher 
educational
attainment than the NHANES sample. Data on smoking
behaviors revealed that treatment-seeking smokers were
similar to current smokers in their time to first cigarette after

waking, but tended to smoke more heavily than current smok-
ers in the NHANES sample (>21 cigarettes/day: 39.7 vs. 22.5%,
P < 0.0001). Current smokers in the NHANES sample, com-
pared to treatment-seeking smokers, had lower intakes of
dietary fiber (13.1 vs. 15.9mg/day, P < 0.05) and vitamin C
(70.2 vs. 87.5mg/day, P < 0.05), both markers of fruit and
vegetable intake, and higher blood levels of total cholesterol
(202.5 vs. 183.8mg/dl, P < 0.05) and triglycerides (158.0 vs.
142.2mg/
dl, P < 0.05). Treatment-seeking smokers had lower
fasting glucose levels and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels than any of the groups in the NHANES sample.
Discussion
We found that treatment-seeking smokers were significantly
more likely to be obese than current smokers in a general

population sample. In addition, these treatment-seeking smok-
ers reported healthier dietary behavior and lower-risk lipid and
glucose profiles than current smokers in the NHANES general

population sample of smokers. Finally, current smokers in
the NHANES general population sample had the lowest com-
bined rates of overweight/obesity compared to never smokers,
former smokers, and treatment-seeking smokers. Data from
current smokers in the NHANES sample support the finding
that smokers tend to have lower body weight than nonsmokers,
possibly due to differences in body weight set-points (3­7). We
had originally anticipated a similar finding among treatment-
seeking smokers, but this was not the case. One possible expla-
nation for why the sample of 
treatment-seeking smokers was
actually more obese than the sample of current smokers is that
the treatment-seeking sample was drawn from smokers living

in Wisconsin. This regional sample may have higher obesity
rates in general than national estimates. However, this expla-
nation is unlikely because the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System found that obesity rates for Wisconsin are
similar to the national rates (24.4%) (ref. 17).
One last possible explanation involves the current study's
finding that the treatment-seeking smokers smoked at a
heavier rate than the current smokers in the general popula-
tion. It may be that individuals who smoke at a higher rate
(i.e., smoke more cigarettes per day) are more likely to seek
cessation treatment due to their inability to quit (18,19). In
addition, individuals who smoke more may be more over-
weight (11­13), possibly due to weight cycling (20­22) from
previous quit attempts (23).
In the present study, current NHANES smokers appeared
to have poorer lifestyle behaviors than never smokers, former
smokers, and treatment-seeking smokers. This finding was
expected, as risk behaviors (low intake of fruits and vegeta-
bles, low physical activity, and high alcohol consumption)
typically cluster together in smokers (24). However, this trend
was not found in treatment-seeking smokers who appeared to
have healthier diet habits than current smokers. Treatment-
seeking smokers may not only be motivated to quit smoking,
but may also be more likely to adopt other healthy behaviors.
This possibility is supported from our data which show that
treatment-seeking smokers have higher intakes of vitamin C
and fiber, and lower levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides,
and fasting glucose compared to current smokers in the gen-
eral population, which may reflect healthier eating.
This study should be interpreted with certain caveats.
First, we compared a national sample (the NHANES) with
a regional sample (the WSHS), and differences in the eth-
nic composition of the two samples may have affected our
results. The representation of African Americans, Hispanics,
and other ethnicities was lower in the WSHS sample than
in the NHANES sample, and therefore care should be taken
in extrapolating the findings for the WSHS sample beyond
white treatment-seeking smokers. Second, this study only
examined dependent smokers who smoked 10 cigarettes per
day. This inclusion criteria may have resulted in an under-
representation of African-American smokers in both samples
because African-American smokers often smoke relatively
few cigarettes per day (25,26). Finally, the higher prevalence
of obesity among the WSHS treatment-seeking smokers
than among the NHANES current smokers could reflect that
smokers willing to participate in cessation trials, in which
they are compensated for their time, may have certain char-
acteristics (such as low socioeconomic status) associated
with negative health outcomes, such as obesity. However, in
a recent study, lifetime characteristics such as socioeconomic
status, education, and ethnicity were similar between smok-
ers who participated in a smoking cessation trial and those
who did not (27).
In conclusion, we found that treatment-seeking smok-
ers are more likely to be obese compared to a general pop-
ulation of smokers. Our data further revealed that despite
the increased health risks due to obesity, treatment-seeking
smokers had healthier dietary habits and better blood lipid
profiles and blood glucose control than current smokers in
the general population, possibly due to making other lifestyle
changes, in addition to seeking smoking cessation treatment.
Health care professionals should be aware that patients seek-
ing smoking cessation treatments may be at particular risk for
obesity related outcomes and providing patients with weight
management or interventions after cessation treatment may
be important.
