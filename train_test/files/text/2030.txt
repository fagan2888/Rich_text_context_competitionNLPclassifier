persist in adolescents with type 1 diabetes

Abstract
Background: Menarche delay has been reported in adolescent females with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), perhaps due
to poor glycemic control. We sought to compare age at menarche between adolescent females with T1DM and
national data, and to identify factors associated with delayed menarche and menstrual irregularity in T1DM.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study and females ages 12- 24 years (n = 228) with at least one menstrual
period were recruited during their outpatient diabetes clinic appointment. The National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2006 data (n = 3690) for females 12-24 years were used as a control group.
Results: Age at menarche was later in adolescent females with T1DM diagnosed prior to menarche (12.81 +/- 0.09
years) (mean+/- SE) (n = 185) than for adolescent females diagnosed after menarche (12.17 0.19 years, p = 0.0015)
(n = 43). Average age of menarche in NHANES was 12.27 +/- 0.038 years, which was significantly earlier than
adolescent females with T1DM prior to menarche (p < 0.0001) and similar to adolescent females diagnosed after
menarche (p = 0.77). Older age at menarche was negatively correlated with BMI z-score (r = -0.23 p = 0.0029) but
not hemoglobin A1c (A1c) at menarche (r = 0.01, p = 0.91). Among 181 adolescent females who were at least 2
years post menarche, 63 (35%) reported usually or always irregular cycles.
Conclusion: Adolescent females with T1DM had a later onset of menarche than both adolescent females who
developed T1DM after menarche and NHANES data. Menarche age was negatively associated with BMI z-score, but
not A1c. Despite improved treatment in recent decades, menarche delay and high prevalence of menstrual
irregularity is still observed among adolescent females with T1DM.
Background
The delay in menstruation in females with type 1 dia-
betes (T1DM) was appreciated well before the more
recent improvement and advances in diabetes treatment
introduced by the Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial DCCT [1-3]. As a result of the DCCT trial [4],
intensive treatment has become the standard of care.
However, little research has been done post DCCT to
see the effect of improved glycemic control on menar-
chal timing and menstrual regularity in adolescent
females with T1DM, and recent data are limited and
often conflicting. Some studies show that menarche is
still delayed [5-9], but others have found no delay [10].
Most studies have found that there is a delay in the
age of menarche if the onset of diabetes occurs before
10 or 11 years of age or near the onset of puberty
[11-15] and that this delay increases with poor glycemic
control [16]. However, one study did not find any asso-
ciation between age at menarche and age of onset of
T1DM [7]. Another study conducted a retrospective
evaluation of 62 adolescent male and females followed
longitudinally from the onset of T1DM until final height
was reached and found that pubertal development and
progression occurred independent of the age at onset of
T1DM and glycemic control [17].
It is important to better understand the relationship
between T1DM and onset of menarche because men-
strual delay can be associated with decreased bone
mineral density [18,19] and irregular menses [15,20-24].
Also, women with T1DM have been reported to have
earlier natural menopause, fewer pregnancies, more still-
births [9] and a higher frequency of hyperandrogenism
and polycystic ovarian syndrome [25,26] than women
without diabetes. Furthermore, women with T1DM are
more likely to have 21- hydroxylase autoantibodies (21-

OH antibodies), a marker of adrenal autoimmunity,
which also are associated with premature ovarian failure
[27].
We investigated the effect of type 1 diabetes (T1DM)
on age at menarche and menstrual history and sought
to identify factors associated with menarche and irregu-
larity in menses. We evaluated factors including A1c,
BMI z-score, presence of 21-OH antibodies, episodes of
severe hypoglycemia, and episodes of diabetic ketoacido-
sis (DKA) since these factors have an impact on diabetes
management and metabolic outcomes. We sought to
identify their potential role in delayed menarche and
menstrual irregularity in adolescents with T1D. Addi-
tionally, since level of regular physical activity can affect
menstrual regularity [28], we also assessed level of phy-
sical activity in study subjects.
Methods
Subjects with T1DM were recruited from the Barbara
Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes (BDC). The recrui-
ter was blinded to the presence or absence of menarche
prior to approaching the subjects for participation.
Females of all ethnicities and ages who had at least one
menstrual period and received their care in the pediatric
department of the BDC were enrolled in the study. Sub-
jects with a preexisting diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroi-
ditis were included if their initial diagnosis was made by
close surveillance and if they had a longstanding history
of being clinically and biochemically euthyroid. Subjects
with celiac disease and any other chronic disease in
addition to TIDM were excluded from the study. A
total of 233 subjects between the ages of 12 and 24
years of age were enrolled in the study between Novem-
ber 2008 and May 2009. Of the 233 subjects with
T1DM, complete data on age at menarche and age at
T1DM diagnosis were available for 228. The age of diag-
nosis of T1DM was not available in four subjects and
two subjects, both 15 years of age, had not yet started
their menstrual periods. These six subjects were
excluded from the analysis. There were 23 subjects with
stable, treated hypothyroidism included in the analysis.
Characteristics of the study participants are shown in
Table 1. Of the 228 females with T1DM, 185 partici-
pants had diabetes onset prior to menarche and 43 were
diagnosed with T1DM after menarche.
Study approval was obtained from the institutional
review board at the University of Colorado Denver and
participants provided written informed consent and
assent, if appropriate, at enrollment.
The National Heath and Nutrition Examination Sur-
veys (NHANES) 2001-06 reproductive health survey was
used as a population-representative comparative control
sample of women. The survey is designed to assess the
health and nutritional status of the non-institutionalized
civilian US population using a complex multi-stage, stra-
tified, clustered sampling design [29]. The 2001-2006
time period was specifically selected as it is the most
recent set of data available and the time period is similar
to the time of onset of menarche for our subjects.
NHANES data are available in 2-yr sets. We selected
the three latest sets of data in order to have enough
power to analyze the groups by ethnicity.
Data collection
The clinical diabetes type assigned by the health care
provider was obtained from the medical records and

categorized as T1DM if the provider assignment was
type 1, type 1a or type 1b diabetes [30]. Height, weight,
and A1c were measured. A1c was measured on a DCA
2000 (Bayer Diabetes Care, Tarrytown, NY). The refer-
ence value for healthy persons is 4-6%. Weight was
measured in kg using a Detecto (Webb City, MO) scale.
Height was measured in centimeters using a Holtain
Limited Stadiometer (Crosswell, UK). Physical examina-
tion including Tanner staging was performed by a
pediatric endocrinologist. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as kg/m2, and BMI z-score was determined
using age and sex specific BMI percentiles from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Demographic data, including race and ethnicity, was
collected by self-report. Physical activity was obtained
using the Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity Screen-
ing Measure (MVPA) and was categorized as the number
of days subjects had accumulated 60 minutes of MVPA
during the past 7 days and for a typical week [31]. Age of
the first menstrual period and menstrual cycle pattern
and length was obtained by self-report using a question-
naire adapted from the NHANES reproductive health
questionnaire. Questions regarding cycle pattern and
length were based on times when the subject was not
taking hormone therapy (oral contraceptives, depo pro-
vera, norplant, etc). Subjects were asked to recall their
age at the time of their first menstrual period. Probing
questions were asked to help the subjects if they had dif-
ficulty remembering the exact age, such as remembering
the season, grade or proximity to a birthday [32]. An
Insulin Record Questionnaire was used to collect insulin
regimen and dose. Insulin dose was analyzed as average
units of insulin used per kilogram of weight per day.
A retrospective review of the chart was performed to
obtain the A1c and BMI within 3 months of the age of
menarche on the 185 subjects diagnosed with T1DM
before menarche. As an additional measure of glucose
control and variability, data were also obtained through
retrospective review of the chart on the number of epi-
sodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), defined as ph < 7.3
and serum bicarbonate < 15, and severe hypoglycemia
(defined as documented blood glucose < 50 mg/dl and
requiring assistance of another person or associated with
loss of consciousness or seizure like activity requiring
treatment with glucagon or IV dextrose) within the two
years prior to menarche. In addition, 21 OH antibodies
are routinely measured on all patients with TIDM receiv-
ing their care at BDC and were collected as part of the
retrospective chart review.
Results
Statistical analysis
An independent samples t-test was used to test the dif-
ference in age at menarche between study participants
who developed T1DM before menarche and those who
developed T1DM after menarche. Due to the complex
sampling strategy used for NHANES 2001-2006, sample
weights were used in PROC SURVEYMEANS (SAS ver-
sion 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to obtain sample esti-
mates and confidence intervals. A one sample Z-test
was used to compare the study sample to the NHANES
data. An independent samples t-test was used to test the
difference in age of menarche between study partici-
pants who had 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies compared
to those without, and to compare age of menarche
among study participants with a history of diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia compared to
those without. A Chi-square test was used to compare a
history of menstrual irregularity between study partici-
pants with and without a history of DKA, and between
adolescent females diagnosed with T1DM pre- vs. post-
menarche.
Linear regression analysis was used to examine rela-
tionships of age at menarche with clinical factors,
including body mass index (BMI) and A1c at the time
of menarche, and to examine age at menarche between
study participants who developed T1DM before
menarche vs. study participants who developed T1DM
after menarche, adjusting for age at visit.
Average age of menarche in adolescents with T1DM
Characteristics of study participants with T1DM are
shown in Table 1, by diagnosis of T1DM before vs. after
menarche. There was no difference in age at visit, A1c,
BMI, BMI z-score, prevalence of overweight, race/ethni-
city, Tanner Stage, or menstrual irregularity between
these groups. Adolescent females diagnosed pre-
menarche had a longer duration of diabetes and a
higher daily insulin dose per kg than the group diag-
nosed with T1DM after menarche.
The overall mean age of menarche among females with
T1DM was 12.69 ± 0.08 years. Adolescent females who
developed diabetes before menarche had an average age of
menarche of 12.81 ± 0.09 years compared to 12.17 ± 0.19
years, p = 0.0015 (Figure 1) in those who developed dia-
betes after menarche. In multivariable linear regression
analysis further adjusting for age at visit, the average age
of menarche among adolescent females diagnosed with
T1DM before menarche remained significantly older than
the age of menarche among adolescent females diagnosed
with T1DM after menarche (least square means 12.82 ±
0.09 years vs. 12.13 ± 0.18 years, p = 0.0006).
Comparison of T1DM to NHANES 2001-2006
NHANES 2001-2006 data from female participants
interviewed using the Reproductive Health Question-
naire and who were between 12 and 24 years of age
(mean ± SE age = 18.2 ± 0.09) showed that the average

age of menarche among adolescent females without dia-
betes (n = 3667) was 12.27 ± 0.038 years, which was sig-
nificantly earlier than adolescent females with T1DM
diagnosed prior to menarche (12.81 ± 0.09, p < 0.0001),
and similar to adolescent females diagnosed after
menarche (12.17 ± 0.19 years, p = 0.6993) (Figure 1). As
the mean age of the NHANES cohort was older than
the T1DM cohorts, we performed a linear regression
analysis adjusting for current age, and found that the
least square mean age of menarche among NHANES
study participants at a current age of 15.8 was 12.27 ±
0.03, which remained significantly younger than the
T1DM group diagnosed prior to menarche (12.81 ±
0.09, p < 0.0001), while the least square mean age of
menarche among NHANES study participants at a cur-
rent age of 16.5 was 12.28 ± 0.03, which was not signifi-
cantly different from the T1DM cohort diagnosed after
menarche (12.17 ± 0.19, p = 0.6922). A further analysis
was conducted using only adolescent females who were
at least 16 years of age (e.g. without primary amenor-
rhea), to ensure that differences in ascertainment of
younger adolescents didn't explain the observed differ-
ences in age of menarche. The average age of menarche
among adolescent females with T1DM diagnosed before
menarche and age 16-24 at the visit (n = 101) was 13.0
± 0.13 years, which was significantly older compared to
the average age of menarche among female NHANES
participants (n = 2272) of 12.5 ± 0.05 years (p = 0.001)
and adolescent females with T1DM diagnosed after
menarche (n = 30) of 12.32 ± 0.22 (p = 0.007).
Age at menarche and clinical factors
A1c at menarche was available for 165 of 185 subjects
with T1DM prior to menarche. A1c was not associated
with age at menarche, although mean A1c (9.3%) was
well above the recommended target for optimal diabetes
control. Out of the 165 girls, 30 (18%) had an A1c at or
below the target (A1c  7.5%) at the time of menarche.
However, there was no difference in age of menarche
between those who achieved the target A1c (12.61 ±
0.21) and those who had not (12.91 ± 0.10, p = 0.20).
When those with menarche within one year of diagnosis
with T1DM were eliminated from analysis in order to
avoid bias due to the `honeymoon' period, 21 (15%), of
the remaining 136 adolescent females had A1c  7.5%.
Although those adolescent females who reached the tar-
get A1c in this subset tended to have an earlier age of
menarche (12.63 ± 0.21) than those who did not (12.99
± 0.10), the difference did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (p = 0.12).
There was a significant negative correlation between
age of menarche and BMI z-score at menarche (r =
-0.23, p = 0.0029). In multivariable linear regression
adjusted for age at T1DM onset and A1c at menarche,
BMI z-score remained significantly associated with age
of menarche (b = -0.32, p = 0.005), as was age at T1DM
onset (b = 0.06, p = 0.02), but not A1c (b = 0.08, p =
0.15)
Race/ethnicity
Age at menarche by race/ethnicity for the BDC sample
and NHANES data are shown in Figure 2. In the BDC
sample, females of Hispanic origin (n = 34) reported
earlier menarche than non-Hispanic white (NHW) (n =
185) females (12.25 ± 0.20 vs. 12.77 ± 0.09, p = 0.0232).
In multivariable linear regression analysis adjusting for

of menarche persisted for Hispanic vs. NHW adolescent
females (least square means 12.33 ± 0.24 vs. 12.94 ±
0.09, p = 0.019)
In the NHANES sample, NHW (n = 1114) females
without diabetes had an average age at menarche of
12.42 ± 0.05 years, which was significantly younger than
the age of menarche in NHW girls in the BDC sample
(p < 0.0001). In the NHANES sample, those of Hispanic
origin (n = 1290) without diabetes had an average age of
menarche of 11.95 ± 0.09 years, which was not signifi-
cantly different from the age at menarche among Hispa-
nic adolescent females in the BDC sample (p = 0.0653).
In the BDC sample, NHW girls with premenarchal pre-
sentation of T1DM (n = 151) had a later age of menarche
than those who developed T1DM after menarche (n =
34) (12.92 ± 0.09 vs 12.32 ± 0.18, p = 0.0062). Subjects in
the BDC sample who were of Hispanic origin and who
developed T1DM before menarche (n = 25) also had
later menarche than those who developed T1DM after
menarche (n = 7) (12.25 ± 0.23 vs. 11.91 ± 0.64, p =
0.5461), although this did not reach significance. NHW
girls who had a premenarchal presentation of T1DM (n
= 151) reported a later age of menarche than Hispanic
girls who developed T1DM prior to menarche (n = 25)
(12.92 ± 0.09 vs 12.25 ± 0.23, p = 0.0083).
21 Hydroxylase autoantibodies
21-Hydroxylase (OH) autoantibody titers were obtained
through retrospective review of the chart. Results were
available on 212 subjects and of those only 8 subjects
had positive titers. The age of menarche in those nega-
tive for 21-OH antibodies (12.69 ± 1.20 years, p =
0.4405) was not different from those with positive 21-
OH antibodies (13.02 ± 0.85 years, p = 0.4405). Since
only 8 subjects had positive 21 OH antibodies the sam-
ple size did not allow for any further analysis.
Severe hypoglycemia and/or episodes of DKA
There was no difference in age at menarche among girls
with a history of at least one episode of DKA (n = 20)
compared to girls without any DKA episodes (12.9 ± 1.1
vs. 12.8 ± 1.2 years of age, p = 0.78) or among girls with
at least one episode of severe hypoglycemia (n = 11)
compared to girls without any hypoglycemic episodes
(12.7 ± 0.9 vs. 12.8 ± 1.2 years of age, p = 0.72) occur-
ring within the two years prior to the start of menarche.
There was a trend towards more irregular menses
among the adolescent females who had one or more
episodes DKA before menarche compared to those with
no episode of DKA (53% vs. 32%, p = 0.08)
Menstrual regularity
Analysis of menstrual regularity was limited to adoles-
cent females who were at least 2 years past menarche.
Among the 181 adolescent females analyzed, 63
reported usually or always irregular cycles (35%) and the
remaining 118 reported regular or very regular cycles.
There was no difference in age of menarche, age of
T1DM diagnosis, total physical activity, typical physical
activity per/day, total insulin units kg/day, A1c, or BMI
at the most recent visit between those who reported
regular (always or usually) compared to irregular (always
or usually) cycles. Total physical activity (OR = 0.973
[0.849-1.116], p = 0.6949) and typical physical activity
per/day (OR = 0.971 [0.845-1.116], p = 0.6801) were not
associated with irregular periods.
Discussion
The present study is the largest to date to examine age
at menarche and menstrual regularity among adoles-
cents and young adults with TIDM. There is conflicting
evidence as to whether the age at menarche in the gen-
eral population has remained the same [33] or has
declined [34]. The results from this study suggest that,
despite improvements and advances in diabetes treat-
ment and insulin regimens, the age of menarche in ado-
lescent females with premenarchal presentation of
T1DM continues to be delayed. Further, menstrual irre-
gularity is common in youth with T1DM, affecting more
than a third of the adolescent females studied.
We observed a negative correlation between age of
menarche and BMI z-score, consistent with other stu-
dies which have also found that pubertal development
[6] and menarche [8] tended to occur earlier in young
women with T1DM whose BMI z-score was high than
in those with a low BMI z-score. While this might sug-
gest that poor metabolic control predicts later
menarche, we found no correlation between age of
menarche and A1c at menarche. Alternatively, the rela-
tionship between BMI z-score and menarche in young
women with T1DM may mirror what has been shown
in the general population [35].
To further explore glycemic control and age of
menarche, we looked at episodes of DKA and severe
hypoglycemia two years prior to starting menarche as
measures of glycemic stability, and found that these fac-
tors were not associated with menarche delay, again
pointing away from glycemic control as the explanation
for delayed menarche.
Since the delay in menarche among adolescent
females with T1DM has not significantly changed in the
last several decades [13,15] despite improvements in dia-
betes management, this suggests that perhaps other fac-
tors besides glycemic control could be contributing to
the menarchal delay in adolescents with TIDM. We
examined whether the presence of 21 OH autoantibo-
dies was associated with menarche delay and did not
find a significant association, but since only a small

number of subjects had positive 21 OH antibodies we
are unable to draw any conclusions. To our knowledge
there have been no other studies that have looked at the
association of menarchal delay in adolescents with
T1DM and positive 21-OH autoantibodies. It is possible
that the presence of autoantibodies that have been
linked to the menstrual cycle disturbances experienced
in T1DM females [36] and premature ovarian failure in
non-diabetic individuals [37-40] could be contributing
to the delay in menarche. However, since positive 21-
OH antibodies were not common in our study popula-
tion, this mechanism is unlikely to explain the menarche
delay we observed.
It is possible that the significant period of weight loss
[41] and physiologic stress preceding the diagnosis of
T1DM could contribute to the delay in menarche. In a
study looking at 928 randomly selected adolescent school-
girls aged 12-18 years with malnutrition it was found that
menarche and start of puberty were delayed by approxi-
mately 1.5-2 years compared to a US reference population
[42]. It is also known that chronic medical diseases other
than TIDM, such as sickle cell disease [43] are associated
with menarchal delay. Thus, it's possible that the initial
weight loss period prior to diagnosis of T1DM, as well as
the presence of chronically abnormal metabolism asso-
ciated with T1DM could contribute to menarchal delay.
Approximately one third of young women with T1DM
of reproductive age will suffer some form of menstrual
dysfunction [44] and our results are consistent with this
finding. In contrast, reported rates of menstrual irregu-
larity in women without T1DM are 50% less than those
with T1DM [15,45]. We found that there was no differ-
ence in age of menarche or A1c at study visit between
those who had regular versus irregular menstrual peri-
ods. It is possible that other factors besides glycemic
control are involved in menstrual regularity in women
with T1DM. In a study looking at 53 T1DM girls, Snaj-
derova found ovarian autoantibodies in 67.9% of the
girls and speculated that the presence of these antibo-
dies and other autoantibodies could somehow be linked
to the menstrual cycle disturbances experienced in
T1DM females (36). However, in our study we found
that the presence of 21-OH autoantibodies was not
increased in subjects with menstrual irregularity (Data
not shown). However, even in patients with chronic spe-
cific organ specific autoimmune disease the presence of
21 OH antibodies is uncommon [45]. Thus, the young
age of our study participants and small sample size the
number of subjects with positive 21 OH antibodies were
limited, making these results difficult to interpret.
Others have speculated that the oligomenorrhea noted
in T1DM is principally hypothalamic in origin and may
represent intermittent (and perhaps reversible) failure of
the GnRH pulse generator [46].
There were some limitations to our study. First, the
participants were predominantly of NHW and Hispanic
race/ethnicity, and so we were not able to provide reli-
able estimates of age of menarche in other racial/ethnic
groups. Also, we did not have a non-diabetic control
group from our population with whom to compare
menstrual irregularity. In addition, there is also the
potential for recall bias with the use of self reported
questionnaires. However, the age of menarche has been
shown to be reliable by recall, as it is usually a date that
is well remembered [47]. Because the majority of our
subjects were adolescent and relatively close to
menarche, their recall may even be more reliable than
in older women. The small sample size for some groups
also limits the interpretation of negative findings, as it is
likely that some of these findings could be explained by
lack of power.
In conclusion, despite improved diabetes treatment
in recent decades, a delay in menarche, although clini-
cally modest, is still observed among girls with T1DM.
Adolescent females who developed T1DM before
menarche had a later onset of menarche than both
adolescent females who developed T1DM after
menarche and adolescent females those without dia-
betes from the NHANES 2001-2006 survey. This later
age of menarche was not associated with A1c, even
when comparing those with good control (A1C <7.5%)
to those with less adequate control. Menstrual irregu-
larity was common in our study participants, but was
not associated with age of menarche, age of T1DM
diagnosis, A1c, current BMI, physical activity or insulin
dose. There are most likely other factors involved in
the timing of menarche and menstrual regularity in
girls with TIDM, and more research is needed in this
area so that the etiology and consequences of delayed
age at menarche in this population can be better
understood.
