Traditional healer treatment of HIV persists
in the era of ART: a mixed methods study
from rural South Africa
Carolyn M. Audet1*, Sizzy Ngobeni2 and Ryan G. Wagner2
Abstract
Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) substantially contributes to the burden of disease and health care
provision in sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional healers play a major role in care, due to both their accessibility and
acceptability. In rural, northeastern South Africa, people living with HIV often ping-pong between traditional healers
and allopathic providers.
Methods: We conducted 27 in-depth interviews and 133 surveys with a random sample of traditional healers living in
Bushbuckridge, South Africa, where anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is publicly available, to learn: (1) healer perspectives
about which HIV patients they choose to treat; (2) the type of treatment offered; (3) outcomes expected, and; (4) the
cost of delivering treatment.
Results: Healers were mostly female (77%), older (median: 58.0 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 50­67), with
low levels of formal education (median: 3.7 years; IQR: 3.2­4.2). Thirty-nine healers (30%) reported being able
to cure HIV in an adult patients whose (CD4) count was >350cells/mm3. If an HIV-infected patient preferred
traditional treatment, healers differentiated two categories of known HIV-infected patients, CD4+ cell counts
<350 or 350 cells/mm3. Patients with low CD4 counts were routinely referred back to the health facility.
Healers who reported offering/performing a traditional cure for HIV had practiced for less time (mean = 16.9
vs. 22.8 years; p = 0.03), treated more patients (mean 8.7 vs. 4.8 per month; p = 0.03), and had lower levels
of education (mean = 2.8 vs. 4.1 years; p = 0.017) when compared to healers who reported not treating HIV-
infected patients. Healers charged a median of 92 USD to treat patients with HIV.
Conclusion: Traditional healers referred suspected HIV-infected patients to standard allopathic care, yet
continued to treat HIV-infected patients with higher CD4 counts. A greater emphasis on patient education
and healer engagement is warranted.

Background
In 2015, there were 19 million people living with HIV in
eastern and southern Africa, including nearly 1 million
people newly infected by the disease [1]. In rural sub-
Saharan Africa, people living with HIV frequently seek
allopathic clinical services while they concurrently receive
treatment from traditional healers [2­6]. In the rural
Bushbuckridge sub-district of Mpumalanga Province,
South Africa, 69% of HIV infected patients report rou-
tinely visiting both types of practitioners to treat their
HIV disease, opportunistic infections (Tuberculosis,
Kaposi's sarcoma), and side effects from antiretroviral
medication (ART) [2]. As knowledge about HIV transmis-
sion and allopathic treatment practices becomes more
widely understood, healers may be incorporating clinical
information about CD4 cell counts, virial load, or the de-
velopment of drug resistance into their own diagnostic
and treatment strategies.
Traditional healers in sub-Saharan Africa are thought
to be able to diagnose and treat physical and emotional

ailments resulting from sources such as social transgres-
sions, spirits, curses, and sorcery, that allopathic health
care workers are unable to address [7­10]. Despite allo-
pathic practitioner's concerns with traditional medicine
use, patients still seek, and often prefer, alternative treat-
ments. Healers generally speak the same local languages
as patients, spend more time with patients explaining
the source of the illness and the necessary treatments,
offer greater perceived compassion than clinicians, and
are oftentimes more easily accessible [11]. When experi-
encing illness, it is common for patients to go back and
forth between the allopathic health system and the trad-
itional health system [2, 11­13]. Medical pluralism is
common among patients dealing with a variety of
chronic and acute ailments, including HIV, leading to
poorer health outcomes among individuals who delay or
abandon allopathic treatment for biomedical conditions
[10, 14­18]. Although there is no legal framework to
control healer treatment of HIV, with those claiming the
ability to cure the disease censured by provincial or
district health offices and by their own healer
organizations.
Little work has been done to document HIV-related
treatment provided by the traditional health system cur-
rently functioning within the rural Bushbuckridge area
where the MRC/Wits Agincourt Research Unit has been
running a Health and socio-Demographic Surveillance
System (HDSS) since 1992. While we know some people
employ traditional services for their HIV care and treat-
ment, we know little of healer perspectives about which
HIV patients they choose to treat, the type of treatment
offered, outcome expected, and the cost of treatment.
This study was undertaken to address this paucity.
Methods
Study location
The study was conducted in the Agincourt sub-
district, Mpumalanga province, northeastern South
Africa. The MRC/Wits Agincourt Research Unit over-
sees the maintenance and operation of the Agincourt
HDSS. Roughly 500 km northeast of Johannesburg,
the unit has been engaged in population-based health
and demographic research since 1992 [19­21]. The
Agincourt HDSS population is comprised of roughly
115,000 individuals ­mainly xiTsonga-speaking­ spread
throughout 21,000 households in 31 research villages.
Roughly one-third of the permanent HDSS population is
comprised of former Mozambican refugees, who immi-
grated to South Africa during the 1980s. The study area
contains eight government run clinics, a public-private
community health center, and one large public health cen-
ter. Patients are referred to three district hospitals, each
located at 25­55 km from the site and relying primarily
on public means of transport. HIV testing and treatment
is available at all public health care facilities in the
Agincourt sub-district. Therapy initially became available
at district hospitals in 2007, with a complete roll-out of
ART to satellite clinics by 2010.
Study population
Traditional healers who are registered with Kukula
organization [22] were randomly selected using the ran-
dom selection function in Stata® (StataCorp, LP, College
Station, Texas, USA). The Kukula organization consists
of more than 300 traditional healers who have organized
to champion for healer rights and responsibilities in the
Bushbuckridge region. The majority of healers living in
the area are members. Of the 169 participants (from a
population of 280) selected to participate, four were no
longer living in the area and five had died. Of the 160
healers who were located and approached to participate
in the study, all accepted (100% acceptance rate).
Ethics, consent and permissions
This study was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional
Review Board (IRB # 140646), the University of
Witwatersrand Institutional Review Board (IRB #140547),
and the Mpumalanga Department of Health's Research
Ethics Committee. All participants provided written in-
formed consent.
Data collection
We conducted 27 in-depth interviews followed by 133
quantitative surveys between July 2014 and August 2015.
We used the in-depth interviews to inform and further
refine the development of the questionnaire used for the
survey. Open, semi-structured interviews were con-
ducted in xiTsonga by a trained qualitative field super-
visor (SN; the other co-authors participated in several of
the interviews) and were focused on generating data on
how healers diagnosed illness, how they learned to treat
HIV, how they decided which HIV-infected patients to
accept for treatment, and whether they believed they
could cure the HIV virus from infected patients. Trad-
itional healers were also asked about the ability of allo-
pathic medicine to treat HIV. Interviews lasted an average
of 61 min. Quantitative surveys, borne from the findings
of our qualitative interviews, asked healers how they diag-
nosed HIV, preferred treatment strategies, anticipated out-
comes, and costs charged to patients. Data was also
collected on the number and type of patient diagnoses in
the past seven and 30 days. Given limitations in healer lit-
eracy, survey data was collected via face-to-face interviews
with healers at their preferred location.
Data analysis
Survey participant characteristics and service uptake
were presented as frequencies with percentages or

medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). Multivariable
log-binomial regression was used to model the odds of
treating HIV. The model was adjusted for age and edu-
cation level.
Qualitative data were transcribed within two weeks of
the interview into xiTsonga and were subsequently
translated into English. Two researchers participated in
the thematic analysis, both with extensive experience
conducting qualitative research. Agreement in coding
was reviewed and discrepancies resolved by consensus.
A comparison of coding agreement on the first six inter-
views found 90% agreement using Cohen's Kappa in
MAXQDA® (VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany) software.
Results
Traditional healer demographics
Among healers who participated in the quantitative sur-
veys, healers in the rural Bushbuckridge were mostly fe-
male (77%), older (58 years [SD: 14]), had been
practicing traditional medicine for an average of21 years
(SD: 14)), and had low levels of education (mean3.7 years
[SD: 3]). Ninety-two healers (69%) self-identified primar-
ily as an Inyanga (herbalist), with the remaining healers
identifying as a Sangoma [divine treatment; 34 (26%)],
herbalist [2 (1%)], or "other" [5 (4%)]. Among all healers,
the mean number of patients treated in the past month
was 6; however, among active healers (those seeing a
least one patient per month), an average of 12 patients.
The majority of healers did not identify with any par-
ticular religion (n = 68, 52%), but the most common reli-
gious affiliations were Zion (n = 19, 15%), Apostolic
(n = 11, 9%), and Bandla Lama Nazaretha (n = 10, 8%).
Immigration from Mozambique (either themselves or
their parents) was reported by 94 (71%) of healers; how-
ever, only 4 (3%) reported speaking fluent Portuguese.
The most commonly reported languages spoken in-
cluded: xi-Tsonga (n = 130, 98%), isiZulu (n = 40, 30%),
English (n = 12, 9%), and Xhosa (n = 8, 6%).
Diagnosis and treatment
When initiating the diagnosis process, healers described
the legal rationale of accompanying the patient to the
allopathic health care facility for HIV and TB testing.
"Yes, it is a law that if a patient comes to us we have to
refer them to the hospital to be tested. We are not
allowed to treat a patient without being tested ..."
(female, unknown age). Despite the health regulation re-
quiring them to refer all patients suspected of having
HIV to clinical sites for HIV counseling and testing,
healers acknowledged that they might unknowingly treat
HIV if a patient lies about their status or refuses to test.
As such, traditional healers often offer treatment for
symptoms suggestive of HIV infection, without knowing
whether or not a patient is HIV-positive. One healer
noted, "The problem with HIV is that you don't know if
you are treating it or not; because when a patient has
diarrhea we give her treatment, when she is coughing or
she had sores or anything, we just give her treatment to
take. Then we end up not knowing if we are treating it
[HIV] or not" (female, 54 years).
Healers who claimed to cure HIV reported diagnosing
the illness through traditional practices (throwing the
bones, for example), while others discussed accompany-
ing suspected HIV cases to the clinic for testing. Healers
who brought patients to the health facility waited with
them, and, if they tested HIV positive, ascertained their
CD4 cell count from the patient. Qualitative interviews
revealed healers differentiating between two categories
of known HIV-infected patients: (1) those with CD4 < 350
cells/mm3 and (2) those with >350 cells/mm3. Healers
were less likely to treat patients with a low CD4 for fear
that they will die in their care: "If the person is not bed-
ridden I do treat her but when she comes to me being
critical ill, I will not cure her because her CD4 count will
be very low and they [her immune system] are failing to
fight the virus" (female, 50 years). Among those sur-
veyed, only 18 (14%) reported successfully curing HIV-
infected adult patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/mm3,
while 39 (30%) reported successfully treating HIV-
infected adult patients with CD4 cell >350 cells/mm3.
Treatment strategies included providing herbal remedies
to be ingested and/or injected. One healer describes the
treatment process: "I will give him two liters of the treat-
ment [containing a mixture of six herbs]. He will take it
and after two or three days he will start to have diarrhea
and when he tells me that he has started to have diar-
rhea I will give him a due date; and I will ask him if they
have the tree that I want him to dig its roots and when
he says they have it I will tell him to dig or to eat its
leaves... his diarrhea will stop and I will also tell him to
stop taking the medication that I have given him. He has
to come back and collect another treatment that will
cure him. All the powers of things that will create AIDS
will be gone after taking the treatment and having diar-
rhea." (Male, 78 years).
Healers who reported treating HIV-infected patients
with >350 cells/mm3 (versus those who did not) treated
more patients (8.7 vs. 4.8 per month; p = 0.03), had been
practicing for less time (16.9 vs. 22.8 years; p = 0.03),
and had lower levels of education (2.8 vs 4.1 years;
p = 0.017) (Table 1). Inyangas had higher odds of treat-
ing someone with HIV versus Sangomas (OR: 2.49), but
this was not statistically significant (p = 0.068). Modified
Poisson regression using robust errors revealed Inyangas
were more likely to treat (RR: 2.20 [CI: 1.00­4.83]
p = 0.049) (Table 2). Being above the median age and in-
creased educational attainment reduced the risk of treat-
ing HIV-infected patients but fell short of the 0.05

threshold for significance. Qualitative interviews re-
vealed that leaves and roots from the Ximuwana, Gashu,
and Nkompa trees were most commonly used to treat
HIV symptoms. Healers charged a median of 92 USD
(IQR: 43­123) to treat HIV patients with high CD4.
Referral to and from allopathic care providers
Healers were generally confident in their ability to treat
certain conditions, but they also frequently referred pa-
tients to the health facility for HIV and TB testing, to
treat dehydration/blood loss, and to assist patients they
judged themselves as unable to cure. Among the healers
in this study, 113 (85%) had referred a patient for dehy-
dration or for a blood transfusion and 47 (36%) referred
a patient to a clinic because they could not successfully
treat them. While these transfers were common, they
also led to patients shuttling back-and-forth between the
two systems. One healer explains, "When looking at the
patient, I can see that this one doesn't have water in his
body because he will be very weak... What I do is to tell
him to go to the hospital and get tested and after testing
and have the results you will come back to me for treat-
ment" (Male, 67 years).
Discussion
Traditional healers in Bushbuckridge, where ART is
available at public hospitals and clinics, continue to treat
HIV-infected patients for both HIV and other opportun-
istic infections resulting from HIV. Inyangas, or herbal-
ists, were at higher risk of believing they could cure an
HIV-infected patient than a Sangoma, an unexpected
finding given the history of Sangomas treating HIV in
South Africa [23]. Our data revealed the increasing so-
phistication of healer practices: healers selected which
HIV-infected patients to treat based on CD4 counts.
Healers were avoiding the treatment of any perceived
end-stage terminal conditions, as the death of a patient
is bad for business. Furthermore, treating HIV-infected
individuals seemingly resulted in increased business.
Healers claimed that they could cure HIV, leaving pa-
tients with no negative health implications after treat-
ment, a potentially more tempting offer to patients than
ART for life. Engagement with healers may need to focus
on healer's ability to both appreciate and subsequently
advertise their own survival rates to gain entry into the
traditional system.
Traditional healers were universally hesitant to dis-
close their strategies and sources of medication to
treat, highlighted their concern with the theft of their
intellectual property [24]. They discussed the use of
unspecified herbs (ingested and injected), baths, and
ceremony to cure the patient from HIV. The use of
razors to inject herbs under the skin of patients is
concerning, given the risk of HIV transmission from
the patient to the healer [25].
The cost of traditional treatment is high, considering
both median income and that primary health care, in-
cluding antiretroviral therapy, [21] is free to the patient
in South Africa. A recent study from South Africa ex-
ploring the cost of traditional healer treatment among
people with epilepsy found costs to be somewhat lower
than HIV treatment, but still substantially higher than
allopathic health care costs [26]. While we cannot iden-
tify the number or proportion of HIV-infected patients
paying these high fees, qualitative interviews and previ-
ous research in Bushbuckridge suggest a large number
of patients do accept their treatment [2].
Traditional healers do refer patients to the allopathic
health care system to ensure that patients suspected of
being HIV-infected are tested and, in some cases, treated
for HIV. In this study, at least 85% of healers had previ-
ously referred patients to allopathic services. This inter-
action highlights, at least, some current level of
engagement between the two systems and while this
study suggests that this engagement is possibly a result
of fear of legal prosecution, further research on whether
voluntary engagement is warranted given the strong re-
lationship between community members and traditional

healers, and the large number of registered healers in
the Bushbuckridge area. Further engagement could fa-
cilitate the incorporation of their work into the allo-
pathic health system. If trained and effectively engaged,
traditional healers could help increase early diagnosis
and therapy uptake with prompt referrals, adherence
support, and avoidance of herb-drug interactions and
toxicity, [6, 9, 10, 27­33] ultimately improving health
outcomes for people with HIV in an region beset with
extremely high levels of HIV [19].
Efforts to increase healer knowledge about specific dis-
eases, improve relationships with allopathic practi-
tioners, and reduce delays to allopathic care have been
piloted with traditional healers in diverse countries, in-
cluding Brazil, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, Cameroon,
Lesotho, Gambia, Nepal, and India [33­48] with mixed
results.
Our random sample of traditional healers living in
northeastern rural South Africa allowed us to generate
data that reflects the source population. However, sev-
eral factors may limit our results. Recall bias may con-
strain a healer's ability to remember the number of
patients (and their diagnosis) treated in the past 30 days.
Social desirability bias may have resulted in fewer healers
reporting the treatment of HIV given healer's knowledge
that treating HIV through traditional means is viewed
negatively in South Africa. The interviewer attempted to
reduce this bias by assuring healers that the data would
not be reported to local authorities nor was she associ-
ated with any of the local health facilities.
Conclusion
Traditional healers in rural South Africa are continuing to
treat HIV symptoms in patients, often at prices much
higher than the free primary allopathic healthcare avail-
able in the area. Further understanding of commonalities
and differences between traditional and allopathic health
care systems, ways of ensuring risk reduction among the
traditional healers, and promotion of honest and targeted
dialogue between the two systems may allow for greater
coordination between the two systems and an ultimate
improvement in HIV patient care in rural South Africa.
