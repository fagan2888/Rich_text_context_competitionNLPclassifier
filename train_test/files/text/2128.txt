Background. Blood pressure (BP) percentiles in childhood are assessed according to age, gender, and height. Objective. To create
a simple BP/height ratio for both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). To study the relationship between BP/height ratios
and corresponding BP percentiles in children. Methods. We analyzed data on height and BP from 2006-2007 NHANES data. BP
percentiles were calculated for 3775 children. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to calculate
sensitivity and specificity of BP/height ratios as diagnostic tests for elevated BP (>90%). Correlation analysis was performed
between BP percentiles and BP/height ratios. Results. The average age was 12.54 ± 2.67 years. SBP/height and DBP/height ratios
strongly correlated with SBP & DBP percentiles in both boys (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.85, R2 = 0.86) and girls (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.85,
R2 = 0.90). The cutoffs of SBP/height and DBP/height ratios in boys were 0.75 and 0.46, respectively; in girls the ratios were
0.75 and 0.48, respectively with sensitivity and specificity in range of 83­100%. Conclusion. BP/height ratios are simple with
high sensitivity and specificity to detect elevated BP in children. These ratios can be easily used in routine medical care of children.
1. Introduction
Hypertension in children and adolescents is defined as sys-
tolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) above the 95th
percentile. BP between the 90th and 95th percentile is des-
ignated "high normal" or "prehypertensive" [1]. Currently
the available data to quantify hypertension in children is in
the form of a table reference matched by sex, age, and height
percentile that identifies the BP as 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th
percentiles [2].
In recent years the prevalence of hypertension in the
pediatric population in the United States has been increasing
[3]. Children and adolescents with primary hypertension
are frequently overweight or obese. The prevalence of
hypertension increases progressively with increasing body
mass index (BMI), and hypertension is detectable in over
30% of overweight children with BMI above 95th percentile
[4]. The increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity
and its strong association with hypertension make both
prehypertension and hypertension a major health problem
in the young [5].
Hypertension in childhood and adolescence can lead
to hypertension as adults [6, 7]. Although hypertension in
childhood has been thought of as an independent risk factor
for CVD (cardiovascular vascular disease), there are several
studies demonstrating the association of hypertension with
other risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyc-
eridemia, low HDL cholesterol, truncal (central) obesity,
hyperinsulinemia, and metabolic syndrome [8, 9].
The criteria for diagnosis of hypertension in children
and adolescents can be complex and challenging to apply in
clinical practice because of age-, gender-, and height-specific
reference values [10]. Both hypertension and prehyperten-
sion though prevalent and increasing in incidence remain
widely undiagnosed [11]. In 2010 Lu et al. evaluated, for
the first time, the feasibility and accuracy of the systolic

blood pressure-to-height ratio (SBP/height ratio) and the
diastolic blood pressure-to-height ratio (DBP/height ratio)
and proposed the optimal thresholds of SBP/height ratio and
DBP/height ratio for identifying hypertension in Chinese
adolescents. They concluded that the BP/height ratios are
simple, inexpensive, and accurate indices for identification
of hypertension in adolescents [12]. Subsequently BP/height
ratios and cutoffs were also proposed for Italian and Nigerian
adolescents [13, 14].
In order to validate the BP/height ratios in US children,
similar studies needed to be repeated and studied further.
Therefore, this formed the basis of hypothesis of our study.
In this study we tested that simple BP/height ratios can be
used as an accurate clinical tool to identify children and
adolescents at risk for hypertension. For this purpose we
have reported the simplified ratios of BP/height as an
accurate detection method of elevated BP. We also report
the correlation of BP/height ratios with commonly used BP
percentiles.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data Collection. We analyzed data on 3775 children
from NHANES 2007-2008 (National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey). Data on age, gender, ethnicity, height,
weight, and waist circumference was analyzed [13]. Systolic
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP),
were reported to be measured by a standard protocol used
by NHANES [14]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated
using the standard formula. BP percentiles were calculated
according to the standard formula provided in the following
referenced manuscript [2].
2.2. Statistical Analysis. Receiver-operating characteristic
(ROC) curve analyses were performed to calculate sensitivity
and specificity of SBP/height and DBP/height ratios as
diagnostic tests for elevated, that is, >90th percentile of SBP
and DBP, respectively. Correlation analysis was performed
between SBP percentile and SBP/height ratio. Similar corre-
lation was studied for DBP percentiles and DBP/height ratio.
ROC analyses and curve generation were performed using
Analyse-it Method Evaluation edition. For data analysis and
interpretation we used SPSS v.19.
3. Results
Data was generated from 1982 boys aged 12.5 ± 2.6 years old
and 1783 girls aged 12.5 ± 2.6 years old. The distribution by
ethnicity as defined in the NHANES Demographics Variable
List was accessed. The various ethnicities were as follows:
1069: Mexican Americans, 383: other Hispanics, 1083: non-
Hispanic Whites, 1047: non-Hispanic Blacks, and 183-other
Races. The BMI percentile in girls from all ethnic groups
was 67 ± 29 (Mean ± SD). Approximately 23 percent of girls
had BMI greater than 95th percentile. The BMI percentile in
boys from all ethnic groups was 66 ± 30 (Mean ± SD). The
proportion of boys with BMI greater than 95th percentile was
approximately 24 percent. The proportion of overweight girls
and boys with BP reading above 90th percentile was 11% and
10% respectively. The proportion of BP above 90th percentile
in all girls and boys was 6.3% and 5.2%, respectively.
SBP/height ratio strongly correlated with SBP percentiles
in both boys (Figure 1; P < 0.001, R2 = 0.85) and girls
(Figure 2; P < 0.001, R2 = 0.85). Similar results were
obtained for DBP/height ratio and DBP percentiles: boys'
P < 0.001, R2 = 0.86 and girls' P < 0.001, R2 = 0.90. ROC
analysis showed a very steep progression of sensitivity and
specificity above certain cutoff values. The cutoffs of elevated
SBP/height and DBP/height ratios in boys were 0.75 and
0.46; in girls the ratios were 0.75 and 0.48, respectively.
Above the cutoff values of the ratios the sensitivity and
specificity of detection of elevated BP (greater than 90th
percentile) was very high as shown in (Table 1). There
was no significant difference of BP/height ratios in various
ethnicities as demonstrated by an inter-group weighted t test
(data not shown).
The accuracy of this determination of ratios above the
95th percentile is diminished by the low number of children.
In this cohort there were only 50 boys (2.6%) who had SBP
percentiles above 95th percentile and only 6 (0.3%) had
DBP above this range. Similarly 46 girls (2.6%) had SBP
percentiles above 95th percentile and only 7 (0.4%) had DBP
percentiles in the hypertensive range.

4. Discussion
Hypertension in the pediatric and adolescent population
may remain undiagnosed. Although the BP charts for age,
gender and height are readily available, they are generally
not used in a busy pediatric practice. The diagnosis of
hypertension may be missed in some children [10]. In
2008 Cunningham reviewed data on 14,187 children and
adolescents. Overall, 507 children fulfilled the criteria for
hypertension, of whom 74% were undiagnosed. Prehyper-
tension was documented in 485 individuals, but 89% had not
been previously diagnosed. [11] The authors concluded that
the current practice of identifying the BP percentiles from
lengthy tables can be cumbersome, ineffective, and can often
miss the diagnosis of hypertension in children, which can
become detrimental to their long-term health [11].
In this study we have shown that BP/height ratios are
simple and accurate method of diagnosing elevated blood
pressure. Our findings are in complete agreement with the
preceding studies on this matter [12­14]. The authors in that
study clearly demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the
SBP/height and DBP/height ratios in their cohort of Chinese,
Italian, and Nigerian adolescents [12­14]. In our study the
cutoff for SBP/height ratio for both boys and girls is 0.75. The
cutoffs for DBP/height ratio in boys and girls are 0.46 and
0.48, respectively (Table 1). The sensitivities and specificities
of these ratios are from 83% to 100% in identifying elevated
BP above the 90th percentile. Our study is the first to report
the BP/height ratio for prehypertension, which can be used
as a reliable tool not only for diagnosis but also screening for
high BP in ambulatory care setting in children. Also, there
were no significant differences of BP/height ratios in various
ethnicities as demonstrated by intergroup weighted t tests.
Therefore, we have proven for the first time that these ratios
can be used universally in most ethnic groups represented
in USA In addition, we have shown that SBP/height and
DBP/height ratios strongly correlated with their respective
SBP and DBP percentiles in both boys and girls (Figures 1
and 2).
Our study has a large cohort of subjects derived from
the NHANES database. Hence the ROC analysis for the
calculated cutoffs generates good power and validation
(Table 1). In this cohort the incidence of BP above 95th
percentile was low (below 3% in both boys and girls).
Therefore it is our belief that more studies need to be done
with looking at a larger cohort of hypertensive children to
assess the reliability and reproducibility of the BP/Height
ratios. Although NHANES data focuses on US children and
adolescents without any particular pathology, the large num-
bers of subjects in this study make it possible to extrapolate
the results at a population level. Also this study is based on
cross-sectional data and does not imply target organ damage,
which would need standard diagnostic techniques such as
echocardiogram.
5. Conclusions
BP/height ratio is a simple, excellent screening and diagnostic
tool with high sensitivity and specificity to detect elevated
BP. The BP/height ratio can be easily used in routine medical
care of children. The BP/height ratios also correlated with the
corresponding BP percentiles in both genders. More studies
are needed in patients with proven hypertension to validate
the use of this proposed BP/height ratio in conditions with
severe elevations of blood pressure.
