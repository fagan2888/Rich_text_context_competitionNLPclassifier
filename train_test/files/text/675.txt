The responses of workers and their employers to the onset of work-limiting health impairments were investigated using
data from the new Health and Retirement Study. The results indicate that many workers who suffer from health
limitations are directly accommodated by their employers, and that those who do not receive direct accommodation
frequently adapt to their limitations by altering theirjob demands or by changing jobs. These findings point to the
potential for adjustments on both sides of the market: by employers, in the form of job accommodation, and by
employees, in theform ofjob change.
MAINTAINING individuals with health limitations in
the labor force is one of the primary goals of the most
recent United States policy concerning those with disabili-
ties(Jones, 1991;West, 1991). The Americans with Disabil-
ities Act of 1990 (ADA) requires employers with 15 or more
employees to make reasonable accommodations for individ-
uals with health problems unless such accommodation
would cause an unreasonable hardship on business opera-
tions (Jones, 1991; ADA 102(b)(5)(A) and ADA 101(10)).
One of the hopes underlying the ADA is that accommodation
at the onset of a health impairment will delay job exit and
subsequent movement onto the disability rolls.
Although the Americans with Disabilities Act was written
into law in 1990, very little is known about the factors that
influence an individual's ability to adapt to a health impair-
ment and continue working, or about the nature and the
range of accommodations and adjustments that individuals
and their employers make to health limitations. What is
known is that a sizable number of men and women nearing
retirement age report health limitations on their capacity to
work (Adams and Benson, 1992; Bound and Waidmann,
1992), and that while many of these individuals leave the
workforce (Bound and Waidmann, 1992; U.S. Department
of Commerce, 1973; Yelin, 1989, 1992), a large number
continue working in spite of their reported health impair-
ments (Burkhauser and Daly, 1996; McNeil, 1993).
Despite the fact that a majority of individuals who experi-
ence a work-limiting health impairment remain in the labor
market, little research has been done on the factors facilitat-
ing their continued work. Rather, most of the research on
health and labor force activity has focused on documenting
the importance of health in explaining early labor force exit
(Reno, 1971; Sammartino, 1987, reviews the literature;
Schwab, 1974; Sherman, 1985) and on understanding other
factors that contribute to early withdrawal (Bound, 1989;
Bound and Waidmann, 1992; Burkhauser et al., 1992;
Haveman and Wolfe, 1984; Parsons, 1980; Yelin, 1992). To
some extent the absence of research on labor market activity
following the onset of a health limitation can be attributed to
a lack of the necessary data. Until recently the only surveys
containing any information on such adjustments were the
Surveys of the Disabled conducted in the 1960s and 1970s
by the Census for the Social Security Administration.
The newly available Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
permits further examination of this issue. A retrospective
module in the first wave of the HRS contains detailed
questions about changes that a cohort of workers and their
employers made following the onset of a health limitation.
These data provide the information necessary to report the
prevalence of worker adaptation and employer accommoda-
tion among a cohort of men and women whose disabilities
occurred prior to the passage of the Americans with Disabili-
ties Act.
As noted, a large body of literature exists on the effects of
health on early withdrawal from the labor market. In con-
trast, relatively little research has been done on the factors
that facilitate continued work. This study focuses on this
issue and examines the extent to which workers, through
their own actions or those of their employer, adjust to their
health limitations and continue working in the labor market.
The sample drawn is based on self-reports about health
conditions that limit the amount or type of work that can be
performed. Analyses are performed separately for men and
women to account for potential differences in the nature of
the disabilities faced, and the opportunities for and rewards
of continued work.
METHODS
Sample Development
The analyses are based on data from the first wave of the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS contains
contemporaneous data on health, employment, income, and
family structure for a nationally representative sample of
individuals born between 1931 and 1941 and their spouses,
regardless of age. A total of 12,564 respondents from 7,703
S53
S54 DALY AND BOUND
households completed an interview in the first wave. (See
Juster and Suzman, 1995, for a detailed discussion of the
HRS data.)
In addition to contemporaneous health information, the
initial wave of the HRS (1992) includes a retrospective
module of questions about the onset of current disabilities.
These questions were asked of individuals who reported that
their health placed a limit on their current ability to perform
paid work. The 1992 retrospective module is similar to the
1978 Survey of Disability and Work; it includes questions
about the onset of the present health limitation; the respon-
dent's job characteristics before and after the impairment
began; the respondent's employment behavior, disability
benefit application and receipt; spouse's work effort; and
specific questions about employer accommodation follow-
ing onset. Based on this retrospective information about the
onset of disability and its impact on employment, pre- and
post-impairment work histories for all individuals impaired
at the time of the 1992 interview are created.
Because the focus of this analysis is on the post-onset
responses of working individuals and their employers, the
sample is restricted to those individuals who reported being
impaired at the time of the interview, became impaired
during their worklife, and were employed at its onset. After
these restrictions are applied and spouses and partners out-
side of the appropriate age range are removed, the analytic
sample contains 1,192 individuals -- 685 men and 507
women -- with complete information. Table 1 details the
development of the analytic sample.
Key Variables
Disability. -- An important concern in any study of the
circumstances and behavior of people with disabilities is
what definition of disability should be used to select the
study population. The Americans with Disabilities Act
defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record
of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an
impairment. This definition of disability is much broader
than ones based on the receipt of disability-related transfers
or on a purely objective set of medical criteria that do not
incorporate information about the individual's environment,
responsibilities, or human capital. Burkhauser and Daly
(1996) suggest that this broader definition is useful when the
research question focuses on individual responses to the
onset of a health impairment and the factors that affect these
responses. There are many methods of operationalizing a
broader definition of disability (see LaPlante, 1991), but in

most cases the selection depends largely on the availability
of data.
In most nationally representative surveys of income and
employment the data available on health are self-reported
and couched in terms of work limitations. The problems
inherent in these types of data are well-documented (see
Bazzoli, 1985; Bound, 1991; Parsons, 1980). Still, re-
searchers have shown these measures to be highly correlated
with more objective measures of health (see Bound, 1991;
Stern, 1989). In addition, self-reported work limitations are
known to be highly correlated with reports on either chronic
conditions or functional limitations (see, for example,
Burkhauser and Daly, 1996). Thus, while self-reported
measures of work limitations contain potential biases, they
do appear to adequately distinguish between those with and
without a health impairment.
Although an extensive set of contemporaneous health and
disability questions is available in the HRS, the retrospective
module used in this study relies on a single self-reported
work limitation question to separate those with and without
impairments. Specifically, the question used in this research
asks, "Do you have any impairment or health problem that
limits the kind or amount of paid work you can do?"
Individuals responding affirmatively to this question are
classified as being disabled. Throughout this article, disabil-
ity and impairment are used interchangeably to refer to
individuals who report that they have a work limitation as
specified in the above survey question.
Employment responses. -- HRS respondents with current
health limitations who were employed at the onset of their
impairment were asked whether, at that point in time, they
stayed with their employer, changed employers, or left the
workforce altogether. Individuals who remained with their
employer following onset are classified as having remained
with their employer; individuals who left their employer at
onset and subsequently worked somewhere else are clas-
sified as having changed employers; and individuals who left
their employer following onset and had not returned to work
by the time of the interview are classified as permanently out
of the labor force.
Job demands. -- Respondents with current health limita-
tions who were employed at the onset of their impairment
were also asked to indicate the extent to which theirjob prior
to onset required physical effort, lifting heavy loads, stoop-
ing, kneeling, or crouching, good eyesight, intense concen-
tration, keeping a pace set by others, or skills in dealing with
people. Those employed after the onset of their impairment
were asked a similar set of questions about that job. Respon-
dents were asked to report whether these descriptions were
true of their jobs all or almost all of the time, most of the
time, some of the time, or none or almost none of the time.
Individuals who reported that they performed the task all,
almost all, or most of the time were classified as having a job
with that characteristic.
In the multinomial logit analysis the detailed job demands
are collapsed into four summary categories. The categories
are designed to represent the four basic dimensions of job
tasks that can be described with the data. These categories
EMPLOYERS AND HEALTH IMPAIRMENTS S55
are: (1) job is physically demanding, i.e., requires physical
effort, lifting heavy loads, or stooping, kneeling, or crouch-
ing; (2) job is mentally demanding, i.e., requires intense
concentration or good eyesight; (3) job requires one to keep a
pace set by others; (4) job requires interaction with people. A
reduction in job demands is defined as a movement from
performing a task all, almost all, or most of the time to
performing the task only some of the time or none of the time.
Employer accommodation. -- As with the job demand
questions, the employer accommodation questions were
asked of individuals who were employed at the onset of their
impairment. Respondents were asked to report on whether
they received accommodation from their employer at onset,
first employer after onset, and their current employer. The
first of these questions asked, "At the time your health
started to limit your ability to work did your employer do
anything special to help you out so that you could stay at
work?" Those who changed employers following the onset
of their health impairment were asked, "Did your new
employer do anything special to make it easier for you to
work at the job?" In addition, each person who reported that
they were accommodated by their employer was asked to
provide information on the type of assistance they received.
Respondents were asked to report on eight specific types of
accommodation, including: provide someone to help with
job; shorten work day; allow schedule change; additional
breaks and rest periods; special transportation; alter the job
duties to something respondent could do; training for new
skills; and special equipment. Information from these ques-
tions is used to describe the adaptations of workers following
the onset of a health impairment.
Analytic Strategy
The responses of workers and their employers to the onset
of work-limiting health impairments are examined in stages.
For the first component of the analysis the sample is divided
into those who remained with their employer at onset, those
who changed employers, and those who left the labor force.
Multinomial logit analysis is used to investigate the correlates
of these three possible outcomes. This procedure is appropri-
ate for estimating the influence of the covariates on the
probabilities of being in one of the three choice groups. Under
this method the error terms are assumed to be independently
and identically distributed as a log Weibull distribution.
Previous researchers have found age, race, and education
level to be important determinants of health-related work
loss (Haveman and Wolfe, 1990). Thus, the set of regressors
includes the age at which the health condition first began to
limit work, and dummy variables for African Americans,
Hispanics, and level of schooling. Age at onset is the age the
respondent recalls first being bothered by the health impair-
ment that currently limits work. Education is a categorical
variable distinguishing among individuals without a high
school degree, high school graduates, individuals with some
college, and college graduates. The omitted category is
individuals without a high school degree. To account for the
employer side of the adaptation decision, information on
employer size and whether the employee was covered by a
union contract are also included as regressors. The employer
size variable is the respondent's estimate of the number of
workers the company employs in all locations. The analysis
variable is the natural logarithm of employer size. Union
status is the respondent's report that he/she is covered by a
union contract.
Other factors not captured by these variables, such as
income, occupation, and the severity of the impairment, may
also be important. Unfortunately, the HRS data contain very
little information about income and occupation at the time of
onset. The data do include each individual's reported health
condition at onset. Eight health condition categories are used
to account for differences in the types of impairments across
the sample. The categories are: Cancers and Tumors; Muscu-
loskeletal Conditions; Paralysis; Heart, Circulatory, and
Blood Conditions; Respiratory Ailments; Gastrointestinal,
Metabolic, and Endocrine Conditions; Neurological and Sen-
sory Conditions; Emotional and Psychological Conditions;
and miscellaneous health problems including: infectious dis-
eases, injuries and traumas, and reproductive health prob-
lems. The health condition-at-onset variables are included
only as controls and are not discussed as part of the analysis.
After the differences among those who remain with their
employer, change employers, and stop working are exam-
ined, the sample is restricted to those who continued to work
following the onset of their impairment. Within this sample,
the adjustments that both employers and employees made
following the onset of a health impairment are investigated
by examining the prevalence of changes in job duties and
employers, explicit employer accommodation, and their
interactions.
In all of the analyses, results are reported separately for
men and women. Previous research has shown that occupa-
tional differences and differences in job demands within the
same occupation produce different effects of disability
across men and women (Baldwin, Zeager, and Flacco, 1994;
Loprest, Rupp, and Sandell, 1995). In addition, men are
traditionally more attached to the labor force and may have
more incentives to adapt or seek accommodation than
women. These potential differences by gender suggest that
separate analyses are appropriate.
As part of the sampling scheme, the HRS oversamples
African Americans, Hispanics, and residents of the state of
Florida by a factor of 2. The sample weights provided on the
current release of the HRS are used to correct for this
oversampling of particular populations. Using the sample
weights, the HRS should be roughly representative of the
U.S. population 51 to 61 years old in 1992. To account for
the use of weighted data when performing the statistical tests
(Clogg and Eliason, 1987; Rodgers, 1992), asymptotic
results derived by Manski and Lerman (1977) are used. In
fact, because the effective sample size (for the purposes of
statistical tests; Kish, 1965) is only somewhat smaller than
the actual sample size, doing so makes little difference to the
reported results.
RESULTS
Table 2 reports the proportion of individuals who were
employed at the onset of their impairment and remained with
their employer, changed employers, or left the work force
and had not yet returned to the labor market by the survey

date. This table indicates that only about one-quarter of those
who became impaired while employed exited the labor force
and had not yet returned. A majority of individuals (just over
one-half) continued with their employer at onset. The re-
maining individuals continued to work but changed employ-
ers. The patterns are similar among men and women, al-
though a slightly larger proportion of women than men left
the labor market.
Table 3 reports the results of a deeper look into the
differences between those who remained with their em-
ployer, changed employers, or stopped working. It displays
the coefficients and standard errors for a multinomial logit
analysis in which remaining with the employer at onset is the
baseline response. The coefficients can be interpreted as the
fractional change in the odds of changing jobs or leaving the
labor force relative to the odds of continuing on the current
job associated with a one-unit change in the explanatory
variable in question. The estimated effects of a change in
each of the regressors on the probability of either changing
employers or leaving the labor force are reported in brackets.
The effects are evaluated at the mean of the dependent
variable. Descriptive statistics for the regressors are reported
in Table 4.
The data in Table 3 show that older workers are signifi-
cantly more likely to remain with their initial employer than
to change employers, but are also more likely to stop
working after the onset of an impairment. Among men, the
coefficients on age at onset indicate that a one-year increase
in the age at onset reduces the odds of changing employers
relative to remaining with the initial employer by .052, and
increases the odds of leaving the labor force relative to
remaining with their employer at onset by .033. Thus, the
effect of a one-year increase in age at onset is to decrease the
probability of changing employers by .01 percentage points,
and to increase the probability of leaving the labor market by
.009 percentage points.
In general, age at onset has a similar effect on the patterns
of response among women. However, in some cases the
magnitude of the responses is greater. A one-year increase in
age at onset among women reduces the odds of changing
employers by .087 and increases the odds of stopping work
by .031. This implies that a one-year increase in age at onset
decreases the probability of changing employers by .02
percentage points, but increases the probability of leaving
the labor force by . 12 percentage points, a magnitude almost
15 times as large as the response among men.
Men and women with at least a high school or college
degree are less likely to stop working than are high school
dropouts; having a high school education decreases the
probability of leaving the labor force by about .18 percent-

age points. Race and ethnicity have no significant effect on
the employment outcomes of men following the onset of an
impairment, but do seem to influence women. African
American females are less likely to change employers and
are more likely to leave the labor force than are their White
counterparts. Being an African American woman reduces
the probability of changing employers by .195 percentage
points but increases the probability of leaving the labor force
by . 186 percentage points. Job characteristics appear to have
no influence on the probability that individuals will leave the
labor force or change employers.
Among characteristics of the employment relationship,
characteristics of the employer are the most powerful predic-

tors of a worker's response to a health problem. Both men
and women employed in large firms are significantly more
likely to remain with their employer at onset than they are to
leave the labor force or change employers. This result is not
surprising, given that larger employers have greater re-
sources and a larger number of employment opportunities
than small employers and thus may be more able to accom-
modate employees with disabilities. In addition, women
covered by union contracts are significantly less likely to
leave their employer at onset. Being a union member de-
creases the probability that the mean woman will leave the
labor force by .04 percentage points. Union status has no
significant impact on the responses of men. One possible
reason for this difference in union effects on men and women
is that men and women covered by unions work in different
jobs, and the jobs that women hold are more conducive to
continued employment than those held by men belonging to
unions. However, since the retrospective module of the HRS
does not provide complete information about occupation and
industry at the onset of disability, a more thorough treatment
of this effect is beyond the scope of this study.
In Table 5 the sample is reduced to only those individuals
who worked at some point after the onset of their health
impairment. Table 5 focuses on job duties before and after
the onset of an impairment. The results are reported sepa-
rately for workers who remained with their employer at onset
and for workers who changed jobs. The proportions repre-
sent the fraction of workers who performed the listed tasks
all, almost all, or most of the time, before and after the onset
of their impairment. The net proportion reflects the change in
the proportion with a particular job demand following the
onset of an impairment. The results indicate that with few
exceptions a significant proportion of individuals working at
jobs with continual physical and/or mental demands reduced
these demands following the onset of a health impairment.
The net changes in physical job demands and working at a
fixed pace were higher for workers who changed employers
than for workers who remained with their employer after
onset. However, these differences were only significant for
women. Overall, men and women who changed jobs were
significantly more likely to report a reduction in job demands
along some dimension than men and women who remained
with their employer following the onset of a health condition
(odds ratios of 1.58 for men and 2.29 for women).

S58 DALY AND BOUND
Using the sample described in Table 5, Table 6 looks
more directly at explicit employer efforts to retain workers
with health limitations. Table 6 describes the prevalence of
reported employer accommodation and compares the experi-
ences of workers who remained with their employer with the
experiences of workers who changed employers. Signifi-
cantly more men and women who remained with their
employer after the onset of their health condition reported
receiving accommodation from their employer. About one-
third of the men and women who remained with their
employer indicated that they were explicitly accommodated.
A significantly smaller fraction (14.1%) of men who
changed employers reported explicit accommodation on the
part of their employer. The situation for women was slightly
different. Nearly one-quarter of the women with an em-
ployer other than their employer at onset reported that they
were accommodated.
Among workers who remained with their employer, ac-
commodation was most commonly provided in the form of
an alteration in job duties, assistance with the job, a change
in schedule or a shorter work day, and more breaks. There
were no clear patterns among workers who were accommo-
dated by a new employer. The least common type of accom-
modation for both groups was special transportation.
The results from Tables 5 and 6 suggest that individuals
who change employers are significantly more likely to
change the demands of theirjob than those who stay, but that
explicit employer accommodation is more common for
workers who remain than for those who move to a new
employer. However, changes in job demands and employer
accommodation are not mutually exclusive alternatives. In
fact, men and women who were accommodated by their
employer at onset were more than three times as likely to
report ajob change than were individuals who remained with
their employer at onset but did not report being accommo-
dated. Although this does not account for differences in
needs among those who were and were not accommodated,
the results do suggest that in some cases job demands and
reported accommodation go hand in hand.
DISCUSSION
As is well recognized (Nagi, 1965; Pope and Tarlov,
1991), work disabilities often reflect mismatches between an
individual's capacities and the physical or mental demands
of a job. Thus, many individuals with health limitations on
their capacities to work may be able to continue in the labor
market by overcoming this mismatch. This study has docu-
mented the kinds of adjustments that a cohort of workers and
their employers made following the onset of work-limiting
health impairments before explicit and comprehensive gov-
ernment protection of people with disabilities was in place.
The findings indicate that among those employed at the onset
of their health limitation, a majority continued to work and
that, of these, a majority continued to work for the same
employer. In addition, more than one-third of those who
continued to work for the same employer mentioned specific
ways in which their employer had accommodated them.
Not surprisingly, age and education play an important role
in determining the employment outcomes for workers fol-
lowing the onset of a health impairment. Older workers are
more likely to stay with their original employer if they
continue to work, but are less likely to continue in the labor
market. This result is open to a variety of interpretations.
Older workers who leave their employer may be more
severely impaired, may not have a marketable set of skills to
transfer to a job more suited to their capacities, or may see
the costs of unemployment until retirement as less than the
costs of retraining or an extensive job search. Unfortunately,
the retrospective module of the HRS does not contain suf-
ficient information to determine why older individuals leave
the labor market.
Education has little effect on the likelihood that workers
will change employers, but workers with at least a high
school education were less likely to stop working after the
onset of a health impairment. Like age, the lack of a high
school education may make it more difficult for workers with
impairments to find alternative employment that matches
their capacities. Baldwin and Johnson (1994) argue that
these individuals -- those with less than average work

EMPLOYERS AND HEALTH IMPAIRMENTS S59
experience or fewer skills -- face discrimination associated
with their impairment apart from any productivity losses.
Among women who become impaired, being African Amer-
ican reduces the likelihood of continued labor market work.
Like older workers, African American women are less likely
to change employers and more likely to stop working than
other women. Again, the retrospective data provide no
information about why these individuals stopped working.
Although other researchers have found differences in the
effects of disability on men and women, few of the results
presented here indicate gender-specific behavior. Men and
women who continue to work following the onset of a health
impairment appear to make similar adaptations and receive
corresponding levels of employer accommodation. One
result that does indicate potential gender differences is in the
decision to leave the labor market or continue working
following onset. The findings indicate that women are more
likely to leave the labor market after the onset of an impair-
ment than are men. Although the data do not permit a direct
investigation of the causes behind these findings, part of the
gender difference might be explained by the relative impor-
tance of male and female earnings in household budgets. In a
majority of households, particularly in this age cohort, men
remain the primary earners. Thus, labor market withdrawal
may be more of an option for women than it is for equally
disabled men. This is only one among many plausible
explanations that open to investigation as more waves of the
HRS data are collected.
While the retrospective data provide little information
about the causes of the differences reported here, they do
give an impression of the groups at risk for leaving the labor
market or changing employers following the onset of a
health impairment. From these descriptive results one can
speculate about why certain groups are more successful than
others in either remaining with their employer after onset, or
changing employers but remaining in the labor market.
Older workers and workers with less than a high school
education may be insufficiently skilled to gain employment
in an enterprise more suited to their post-onset capacities.
Presumably, younger workers and workers with more edu-
cation would have a larger set of opportunities and might
find it more beneficial to retrain in order to find new employ-
ment. To the extent that African American women face labor
market discrimination, these women may find their opportu-
nities for job change to be more limited. In general, these
results indicate that traditional factors associated with differ-
ential outcomes in the labor market also account for differen-
tial outcomes in the post-onset employment responses of
people with disabilities.
Among those workers who continued to work following
the onset of an impairment, the findings indicate that many
of those who remained with their pre-onset employer experi-
enced a combination of reductions in their job demands and
explicit employer assistance. For those who changed jobs,
adaptation occurred more often through changes in job
demands than through employer accommodation. The find-
ing that a significant fraction of employers made accommo-
dations for their employees prior to the passage of the ADA
is consistent with research done on the 1972 and 1978
Surveys of the Disabled (Burkhauser et al., 1992; Lando,
Cutler, and Gamber, 1982; Schechter, 1981) which indicate
that nearly one-third of those who experience a disability
report some form of employer accommodation. These find-
ings support recent anecdotal evidence that suggests that
employer accommodation following disability is not uncom-
mon (Chirikos, 1991) and may contribute to a worker's
ability to remain in the labor market.
The results presented here provide population-based de-
scriptive information to support the anecdotal evidence that
(a) employers often accommodate workers who suffer health
impairments, and (b) among workers who are not explicitly
accommodated, changes in employers and job duties often
occur. However, this does not imply that everyone who
experiences a health impairment will be able to continue
working. A large part of this determination will have to do
with the severity of the limitation (McNeil, 1993). This can
be true either because severity affects an individual's capac-
ity to continue working or because it affects an employer's
willingness and/or ability to make accommodations. Em-
ployers may be more likely to accommodate milder impair-
ments, while accommodation may be more essential for
those with more severe limitations. Although the retrospec-
tive portion of the HRS data does not permit an investigation
of the relationship between severity and accommodation or
employee adaptation, other research suggests that some
employers are willing to accommodate individuals with
impairments severe enough to qualify them for disability
benefits (Hennessey and Muller, 1994).
This study highlights the possibility of adaptations to the
onset of a disability on both sides of the labor market: by
employers (in the form of job accommodation) and by
employees (in the form of a reduction in job demands
through changes in jobs and/or employers). In addition, the
findings suggest that employers, particularly large employ-
ers, play an important role in protecting impaired workers
from work losses associated with the onset of a health
impairment. A natural next step to understanding the poten-
tial impact of the ADA is to ask whether the changes in job
duties and employer accommodations lengthen the active
working life of impaired workers. It will also be important to
investigate which workers receive accommodation and un-
der what circumstances. These are the types of questions that
need to be answered before the potential effectiveness of
laws such as the ADA can be evaluated.
