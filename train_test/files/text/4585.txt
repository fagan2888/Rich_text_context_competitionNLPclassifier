Abstract
This study sought to identify barriers and facilitators to delivery of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in schools. Four
focus groups were conducted with 28 staff members, from four National Health Service school-aged vaccination (SAV) teams
in London. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. School engagement and support, and understanding and education
about the vaccination (or conversely, a lack of) were identified as both barriers and facilitators. Limited school and team
resources, fear of the vaccination, and poor consent form return were identified as barriers. Explanations for why some girls
do not complete the vaccination series were provided. Individualizing approaches used to promote and encourage the vac-
cination was identified as a facilitating factor. Optimal delivery of the HPV vaccination program is dependent on school
engagement and the allocation of time for SAV teams to promote vaccination uptake. Immunization program providers should
work with schools to improve understanding and support of the HPV vaccination program.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually trans-
mitted virus. Most sexually active adolescents and women
contract HPV shortly after initiating sexual activity (World
Health Organization, 2014). For the majority of women,
the virus will spontaneously clear; however, in some cases,
it can cause cell abnormalities that can develop into cervi-
cal cancer (World Health Organization, 2014). Cervical
cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women world-
wide (IARC, 2012), and persistent infection with HPV is
known to cause almost all cases (World Health Organiza-
tion, 2014).
Since 2008, a national publicly funded immunization
program for HPV has been available in the United King-
dom. This program is commissioned by National Health
Service (NHS) England under Public Health England
(PHE) guidance and delivered by school-aged Vaccination
(SAV) or school nursing teams (SAV refers to the child flu;
HPV; meningitis types A, C, W, and Y; and teenage booster
Section 7a immunization programs). HPV vaccination is
offered to all girls aged 12­13 years (in School Year 8)
and is primarily offered in secondary schools--although
can also be received through community clinics or general
practice--up to the age of 18 years. The vaccine is free at
the point of delivery and is currently administered in a two
dose series (PHE, Department of Health, NHS England,
2014). HPV immunization programs have now been imple-
mented in 64 countries nationally, some of whom have
been delivering the vaccine for over a decade, for example,
United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. The vaccine
is delivered through schools in 42 countries (Bruni et al.,
2016). Adolescent boys are not currently included in the
UK school HPV immunization program (although this is
due to change in the future), but men who have sex with
men up to age 45 can be vaccinated in sexual health or HIV
clinics.
In the United Kingdom, uptake of the HPV vaccination is
high, with 87% of 12- to 13-year-old girls receiving at least

one dose in 2016/2017 and 84% of girls aged 13­14 receiv-
ing two doses (PHE, 2017a). However, there are pockets of
the population who remain unvaccinated, and there is huge
variability in uptake between areas; for example, uptake of
the first dose in Enfield is 74%, whereas in North Yorkshire
it is 98% (PHE, 2017b). More specifically, in London,
uptake of the vaccination is suboptimal at 84%, placing it
in the bottom 20% of areas in England (PHE, 2017b). This
variation in uptake has the potential to widen inequalities in
HPV-related disease.
Previous research has suggested that ethnicity may be an
important factor contributing to lower uptake of the HPV
vaccination. Girls from non-White British backgrounds are
less likely to receive the vaccination than White British girls
(Fisher, Audrey, Mytton, Hickman, & Trotter, 2014; Fisher,
Trotter, Audrey, MacDonald-Wallis, & Hickman, 2013). For
example, a study published in 2014 reported that 91% of
White British girls had initiated the series, compared to
89% of those from Mixed backgrounds, 81% from Asian
backgrounds, 79% from Chinese backgrounds, and 77%
from Black backgrounds (Fisher et al., 2014). This ethnic
disparity has been shown to remain even when controlling
for deprivation (Fisher et al., 2014). Parents from ethnic
minority backgrounds have reported concerns about the vac-
cine, including a lack of perceived need for it because they
teach abstinence from sex before marriage to their daugh-
ters, concerns that having the vaccination may encourage
promiscuity, and believing that 12­13 is too young to vac-
cinate their daughter (Forster, Rockliffe, et al., 2017; Mar-
low, Wardle, Forster, & Waller, 2009; Marlow, 2011).
However, other issues affect parental decision-making,
regardless of ethnicity. For example, concerns about side
effects, having a lack of knowledge about the vaccination,
and hearing negative stories about the vaccine from other
parents have all been reported as affecting the decisions
about the HPV vaccination of parents from all ethnic back-
grounds (Forster, Rockliffe, et al., 2017).
While we have some understanding of the factors affect-
ing parental decision-making, we have limited knowledge
about factors that may facilitate or inhibit delivery of the
HPV vaccination in the UK school context, which may sub-
sequently affect vaccination uptake. Of the research that has
been carried out in this area, interviews with nurses high-
lighted that commitment to the vaccination program from
schools and school staff has the potential to affect uptake
(Batista-Ferrer, Trotter, Hickman, & Audrey, 2016). Simi-
larly, other studies have cited additional barriers to delivery
including schools not prioritizing the vaccination and
schools not following up missing consent forms or schools
being unable to help organize the vaccination sessions
(Batista-Ferrer et al., 2016; Brabin et al., 2011). Other
reported barriers include the increasing workloads of immu-
nization nurses and small team sizes (Brabin et al., 2011;
Hilton, Hunt, Bedford, & Petticrew, 2011).
These aforementioned findings are not unique to delivery
of HPV vaccination, nor to a UK setting. A recent review of
studies focusing on the delivery of school based vaccination
programs in high-income countries found comparable results
to those previously reported (Perman et al., 2017); manage-
ment and leadership of vaccination programs at a school or
area level and interorganizational relationships (e.g., between
education and health sectors) were found to be important
factors influencing how effectively vaccination programs
were delivered. More specifically, however, the review high-
lighted the importance of strong professional relationships
and of the commitment and engagement of all school staff
in influencing program effectiveness (Perman et al., 2017).
The competing demands model (Jae
´n, Stange, & Nutting,
1994; see Figure 1) provides a framework of interrelated
factors that may create barriers to service delivery within
the context of clinical preventive services. The model was
designed to explain the delivery of preventive health ser-
vices in primary care with a focus on physicians; however,
concepts are relevant for understanding other health profes-
sionals' ability to deliver preventive health care. According
to the model, the factors that may create barriers to service
delivery involve health professionals, patients, and the ser-
vice environment. The model suggests that lack of time,
alternative demands, and workload will affect a health pro-
fessional's ability to deliver a preventive service. Similarly,
the service environment may affect delivery due to the way
in which it is organized, the involvement of other (allied)
health professionals, or the characteristics of the community
in which the service is set. In the context of HPV vaccina-
tion, this model may help to enhance our understanding of
the way in which the vaccination is delivered in schools and
of the multiple competing demands placed upon immuniza-
tion nurses, which may ultimately affect delivery and/or
uptake of the vaccination.
In the UK, there is a distinct lack of research exploring
issues affecting delivery of the HPV vaccination within the
school setting. Of the limited research that does exist, it has
either been conducted immediately after the introduction of
the vaccination, now almost 10 years ago, or not focused
exclusively on the views of the immunization nurses who
deliver the vaccination. Factors affecting delivery may
change over time, or as a consequence of changes made to
the vaccination schedule, for example, changes to the vac-
cine offered (from the bivalent HPV vaccine to quadrivalent
vaccine) and the number of doses required (from three doses
to two). Nurses' perspectives on delivery may also shed light
on ethnic and geographical disparities in uptake. It is there-
fore important to assess how the vaccination is being deliv-
ered at this point in time and to identify factors that may be
affecting delivery of the vaccination, to better understand
how uptake may be improved. The purpose of this study is
to explore the barriers and facilitators to delivering the HPV
vaccination within the school environment reported by
immunization nurses.

Method
This focus group study was conducted between February
and September 2017 in London, UK. Ethical approval was
granted by University College London (UCL) Research
Ethics Committee (7427/004).
Setting
In the UK, all routine vaccinations for school-aged children
are generally delivered in school by SAV providers or
school nurses. This approach has the advantage of facilitat-
ing vaccination of large groups of children at one time (with
parental consent), rather than children having to individually
visit a health provider, resulting in high vaccination uptake.
There are 11 SAV providers in London covering 32 London
boroughs. In 2016/2017, the average uptake rate for these
providers for the first dose of the vaccine ranged from 79%
to 89% (PHE, 2017b).
Sample and Recruitment
Four London-based NHS SAV teams were purposively
sampled. All members of the four SAV teams were eligible
to participate, as we wanted participants to contribute a vari-
ety of viewpoints. The SAV teams from which participants
were recruited were based in different areas of London, with
varying rates of vaccination uptake, to ensure a mix of views
and experiences. Recruitment was facilitated by collaborat-
ing researchers from NHS England (London) immunization
commissioning team (L.R. and a public health registrar),
who contacted SAV providers across London, requesting
their participation in the study. Those SAV providers who
agreed to participate invited their team members to take part
in the focus groups on our behalf.
Data Collection
Four focus groups were conducted with SAV team members
at their place of work. We used focus groups to facilitate
discussion and interaction between participants. It was not
feasible to conduct more than four focus groups given the
workload and time restraints imposed upon SAV teams.
However, this number of focus groups was deemed suffi-
cient, as it has been suggested that 90% of qualitative themes
are likely to be discoverable within three to six focus groups
(Guest, Namey, & McKenna, 2016). Each focus group com-
prised participants from the same SAV teams, who were
therefore familiar with one another.
Focus groups were facilitated by two researchers (L.R.
and a public health registrar) and took place in the partici-
pants' workplace. All participants provided written consent,
and all sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verba-
tim. Focus groups lasted an average of 1 hr. Participants
were also asked to complete a short questionnaire that gath-
ered information about participants' sex, job title, length of
time in current role, and date of qualifying as a nurse/immu-
nization nurse, if applicable.
A topic guide was used to direct the discussions and
focused on the perceived barriers and facilitators to the
delivery of the HPV vaccination in schools (delivery of both
dose one and two). We used the competing demands model
(Jae
´n et al., 1994) to help develop the topic guide and

included prompts relating to competing factors identified in
the model, where relevant. For example, prompts covered
topics such as workload (related to both the health profes-
sional and service environment), and knowledge and atti-
tudes (related to both the health professional and the
patient). The researchers took detailed notes following the
completion of each focus group and discussed the outcome
of each session to identify ways in which the facilitation of
the sessions could be improved (e.g., by improving interac-
tions with participants).
Analysis
Data were analyzed thematically by two researchers (L.R.
and A.F.), one of whom had conducted the focus groups.
Initially, these two researchers each generated codes for
half of the data to develop a basic coding frame. L.R. and
A.F. next discussed and refined this coding frame before
using it to recode all the data using the qualitative data
analysis software NVivo 11. Interpretations were made
by both researchers, and any discrepancies were resolved
through discussion.
The results present a summary of the themes derived from
the data. Quotes are presented to illustrate the themes and are
reported with focus group number and participant number.
Additional participant quotes can be found in Online Sup-
plemental Material.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Focus groups were conducted with a total of 28 participants
and comprised between 6 and 9 participants in each group.
Participants had worked in their respective roles for an aver-
age of 3 years, and most were female (n ¼ 27; 96.4%).
Participant job roles included nurse (17) and administrative
and managerial staff, some of whom were trained as nurses;
project officer (2); team assistant (2); administrator (2); clin-
ical lead (1); operations manager (1); project manager (1);
clinical director (1); and team lead (1).
Summary of Themes
Seven main themes emerged from the data relating to issues
that were perceived to either hinder or facilitate the delivery
of the HPV vaccine. Lack of school engagement and support
(Theme 1) was identified as a barrier to delivery, as was
limited school and team resources (2), and a lack of under-
standing and education about the vaccination from schools,
parents, and girls (3). Fear of the vaccination (4) and poor
consent form return (5) were also identified as barriers.
Explanations for why some girls do not complete the vacci-
nation series (6) were provided. Conversely, facilitating fac-
tors were identified as the engagement and support of
schools (1), and good understanding and education about
the vaccination (3). SAV teams adopting an individualized
approach (7) were also identified as a facilitating factor.
Barriers and facilitators that fall under the same theme have
been reported together.
School Engagement and Support
Participants discussed the challenges of engaging schools
that are unsupportive and less willing to facilitate the
vaccination program, particularly larger schools, those
in more deprived areas, and schools where the head
teacher does not support the vaccine. Several participants
found engaging certain faith schools particularly difficult;
participants experienced issues such as consent forms not
being handed out, alternative covering letters being
attached to consent forms discouraging vaccination, and
in a minority of cases, denial of entry into the school.
Participants felt that in some schools, the vaccination was
not prioritized due to pressures and competing demands
placed upon school staff.
Participants talked about the reluctance of some schools,
both faith and nondenominational, to have the SAV teams
visit, and about feeling as though they were viewed as an
inconvenience. Participants mentioned specific incidents
when schools had been uncooperative by denying them the
opportunity to carry out catch-up sessions, withholding par-
ental contact information and reluctance to allow teams into
the school for more time than the school deemed necessary.
One participant commented that some schools merely pay
lip service to vaccination.
What I'm finding is not all of the areas are, school-wise, sup-
porting us. [ . . . ] umm, I find that without the support of the
schools, that makes it a hard job. (FG1, P4)
Conversely, the provision of support from participating
schools was felt be an important facilitating factor; schools
that are on board with the vaccination program, that are
organized, and communicate well were felt to be easier to
work with, and it was suggested that these factors are
strongly linked to the number of returned consent forms.
At an individual-level, good working relationships
between immunization nurses and key members of staff was
perceived to be important, as is working with organized staff
members who are persistent and proactive at "chasing up"
(following up) unreturned consent forms. Furthermore, hav-
ing a school nurse available (in private schools), or a coor-
dinator, was perceived to be helpful, as was the cooperation
of the school in letting immunization nurses chase up girls
who have not returned their forms.
Some schools [ . . . ] as our relationships gained with them, the
uptake has got better and how they work in the school with
getting these girls ready and getting consent forms for us has,
like, increased the uptake. (FG2, P13)

School and Team Resources
School resources. Allocation of school staff to assist with the
vaccination was discussed by several participants who felt
that this responsibility is sometimes given to staff members
who are too busy to undertake such tasks such as heads of
year. Furthermore, participants discussed the inconsistency
of staff members with whom they liaised. Being unable to
maintain a relationship with one key member of staff was
perceived to be problematic; one participant explained that
where good relationships did not exist, it could be difficult
to encourage school staff to chase (follow up) consent
forms, to organize vaccination sessions, and to release par-
ental contact information.
There's one school that we go into where the receptionist is the
person that's getting the children to come down for the vaccina-
tion session [ . . . ] and they won't release other members of staff
to be with us during the vaccination session, so we have to allow
more members of staff in that school and rely on a person who's
already very busy and stressed during that time. (FG4, P28)
Team resources. Participants also discussed the pressures
they experienced as a team, in terms of their workload and
the labor intensity of some of the tasks they have to per-
form. Several participants described being limited for time,
which affected their ability to fully carry out certain tasks
such as making phone calls to all parents who have not
returned consent forms. Having few permanent staff mem-
bers within the SAV teams and small team sizes were felt to
compound these issues.
. . . doing the session is the easy bit, it's the preparation. It's the
consent forms. It's getting the consent forms back, and having
enough time to triage, `cause no one can write, fill a form in
properly. Y'know, they [parents] never answer questions,
y'know. I spent a day last week making 70 phone calls.
(FG1, P3)
Education and Understanding
Poor education about the vaccine was cited by a number of
participants as a barrier to vaccination. Firstly, it was sug-
gested that for some parents, and schools, the importance of
the vaccination was not paramount enough, which partici-
pants believed was due to a lack of understanding. Partici-
pants felt that negative parental attitudes toward the
vaccination were often based on poor understanding about
the nature of the vaccine. Secondly, participants gave exam-
ples of common misconceptions, which participants felt
influenced parents' decision-making. Misconceptions
included parents believing that the vaccination may promote
promiscuity, that girls are too young to have the vaccine, and
that promoting safe sex practices or abstinence before mar-
riage will prevent HPV infections.
Some participants felt that deprivation (a lack of mate-
rial benefits considered basic necessities in society) and
demographic factors affected parents' understanding, espe-
cially in areas of London that are particularly ethnically
diverse and where language barriers exist. Sources of inac-
curate information (e.g., some online sources) were also
highlighted by some participants as contributing toward
parents' lack of knowledge. A number of participants felt
that the way in which information is delivered is also
important, with accurate information sometimes hindered
by poor delivery methods; for example, providing informa-
tion in a lengthy format.
It's, that's just an education thing, isn't it? Umm, which, I think
is, is key, actually. That's where I think there is a massive gap,
not just from the parents' point of view, but also from the
schools' point of view. I don't think the schools really under-
stand the importance of that vaccine as well as the parents.
(FG1, P5)
Participants explained how they support parents with
educational barriers to become more informed about the
vaccination by providing information directly over the
phone and at school open evenings, signposting parents to
different sources of information and providing them with
written materials such as leaflets. The importance of tailor-
ing both the content and the delivery of information to dif-
ferent audiences was also discussed; the provision of
culturally sensitive materials (including having materials
in non-English languages) was viewed as important, as was
the tailoring of delivery approaches to the demographics of
different communities. Several participants discussed the
benefits of phoning nonresponsive parents, as it provides
an opportunity to answer questions, address misconceptions,
and challenge parents' decision-making.
And often they [parents] will say, you know, it's good to talk
rather than read the leaflet `cause the questions aren't often on
the leaflet that they want to discuss properly . . . . (FG3, P20)
Normalization and heightened awareness of the vaccina-
tion were perceived to act as facilitators to delivery of the
vaccination. Knowing other girls and older siblings, who
have received the vaccination, was viewed to be helpful in
reducing opposition from girls. Knowing someone person-
ally who had been affected by cervical cancer was also
identified as a facilitating factor for parents, when making
their decision regarding consent.
Furthermore, a number of participants discussed how
good communication with girls can be used to facilitate
vaccination. Participants talked about taking any opportu-
nity to talk to girls about the vaccination and to educate
them, as well as calming nervous girls down before the
procedure, and dispelling misconceptions and fears. These
approaches were discussed in addition to more formal
Rockliffe et al. 5
methods of communication such as delivering talks and
engaging in health promotion activities via the schools.
Fear of Vaccination
Participants reported that some girls' fears affected their
willingness to have the vaccine. Fear was perceived to be
related to the use of a needle, anticipation of pain, or in some
cases the belief that the vaccine is harmful. The social
impact of other girls' negative experiences of the vaccina-
tion was perceived to heighten levels of fear; it was reported
that some girls opt out after realizing other girls have done
so. Some participants believed that some parents mask their
own concerns about the vaccine by claiming their daughters
are needle-phobic.
Some children will give us all sorts of stories that they've been
told or they've heard, erm, some children will just refuse out-
right because they don't want to have it done [ . . . ] they're
scared . . . (FG2, P11)
Poor Consent Form Return
Participants explained that parents, girls, and schools can all
contribute to low rates of consent form return, which can
have a direct impact on vaccination uptake. Participants felt
that many parents who fail to return the forms may do so
because they are too busy or time restricted rather than mak-
ing an active decision to reject the vaccination. These par-
ents may be more likely to provide consent if contacted by
an immunization nurse, helping to address practical barriers.
However, contacting parents can be problematic in itself,
with many parents hard to get in touch with. A number of
participants believed that some girls were responsible for
missing forms, by not delivering them to their parents or
failing to return them to school. Furthermore, disorganiza-
tion within schools was felt to contribute to the problem, as
was having a lack of oversight over the consent form distri-
bution/return process within the school.
They won't even reach home, `cause they [the girls] don't
wanna have it and they don't want their parent . . . and if there's
no email that goes home, or anything that makes the parent
aware that that's gonna take place, then they might not even
see the consent form. (FG4, P27)
Explaining Why Some Girls Don't Finish the
Vaccination Series
A number of suggestions were made to explain why some
girls receive the first dose of the vaccine but not the second.
These reasons included girls being absent on the day of
vaccination, having a negative reaction after the first dose
(e.g., feeling unwell or developing a rash), or having a par-
ticularly negative experience (e.g., experiencing a lot of
pain). Furthermore, participants cited that girls moving
schools or leaving the country after receiving the first dose
was a particular issue in London. Participants also felt that
some parents may do more research into the vaccine after
consenting to the first dose and then change their mind.
Delays in delivering dose two means that on occasion deliv-
ered doses will not be included in the uptake figures, if they
are done in the next school year.
I think it has to be accounted for a little bit that if the girls leave,
because although we try and find out obviously where they've
gone to, it's sometimes out of our hands to be able to catch up
with that child that's left. (FG4, P26)
Individualizing the Approach
Owing to differences in the ways schools work and in the
varying maturity levels of girls, participants emphasized the
need for individualized approaches. This was sometimes to
help girls feel more comfortable with the process and
included offering them biscuits or chocolate, playing music
during the session, providing magazines for them to read,
and allowing them to bring a friend along for moral support.
. . . it's to have a nice, quiet area with, and also an area, when
you've got the really nervous ones, where you can take them
over as well, because those, y'know, don't forget, these kids
haven't had a vaccine without their mum for years, y'know. A
lot of them, y'know, they're mature, but some of them are very
immature . . . (FG1, P3)
Other approaches included providing incentives for the
girls (e.g., bracelets, food, pens), running catch-up clinics,
emphasizing the financial value of the vaccination to the
girls, and feeding back to schools on their performance.
Taking verbal consent was also found to be effective, and
participants from one focus group felt positively about their
experience of using electronic consent forms. Several par-
ticipants discussed the different approaches they have used
to vaccinate girls in schools, which opposed the vaccina-
tion, including gaining verbal consent from parents over
the phone and taking the girls off school premises to vac-
cinate them.
Participants had suggestions for other approaches that
they did not currently use that might improve uptake includ-
ing providing schools with monetary incentives, using name
and shame techniques with poorly performing schools and
celebrity endorsement of the vaccination. Going forward,
participants felt that they could have more help and support
from the NHS England/PHE immunization commissioning
team as well as backing from local authorities.
I personally think that if the local authorities were a little bit
more driving of the programmes, I think that more of the
schools would respond better because I think it's okay it coming
from us as a health issue, but it need to come from the local
authority, from the education department . . . . (FG2, P11)

Discussion
This study sought to understand the barriers and facilitators
to delivery of the HPV vaccination in schools, using the
competing demands model (Jae
´n et al., 1994) as a frame-
work to guide our exploration. Our analysis of focus groups
conducted with NHS SAV team members identified seven
main themes relating to factors that were perceived to either
hinder or facilitate the vaccination process. Engagement and
support of schools was felt to affect vaccination delivery. A
lack of resources within the school and within SAV teams
was also perceived to act as a barrier. Education and under-
standing was perceived to affect parents' attitudes and
schools' commitment to the vaccination program. Fear of
the vaccination and poor consent form return were also felt
to act as barriers. Participants provided explanations for why
some girls do not complete the vaccination series and dis-
cussed ways in which the SAV teams individualized
approaches to improve uptake.
Lack of support and engagement of schools participating
in the vaccination program was perceived to be one of the
main barriers to delivery of the vaccination. These findings
are reflective of issues raised by school nurses in previous
studies, who similarly experienced low levels of staff com-
mitment, cooperation, and prioritization of the vaccination
program (Batista-Ferrer et al., 2016; Brabin et al., 2011).
Conversely, school support facilitated delivery. These find-
ings support Perman et al. (2017) who identified that insti-
tutional relationships play an important role in the delivery
of school-based vaccinations, both in the United Kingdom
and abroad.
Our findings identified poor education and understanding
about HPV and the vaccination as another major challenge
for vaccination delivery. Previous research has shown that
both girls' and parents' knowledge about HPV and the vac-
cination is associated with uptake (Bartlett & Peterson,
2011; Kessels et al., 2012), and low levels of knowledge
have been found for both groups, in the United Kingdom
and abroad (Allen et al., 2010; Batista-Ferrer et al., 2016;
Bowyer, Marlow, Hibbitts, Pollock, & Waller, 2013; Dodd
et al., 2014; Hilton & Smith, 2011; Marlow, Zimet, McCaff-
ery, Ostini, & Waller, 2013). Our results lend support to
these findings but also identify that low levels of education
and understanding within the school are additional barriers
to delivery of the vaccine. The lack of knowledge of school
staff about the importance of the vaccination was felt to
affect levels of school engagement and commitment to the
vaccination program and is an issue that has not previously
been identified in the literature as a barrier to delivery.
Although participants believed that greater education for
parents and girls would further facilitate vaccination, there
is limited evidence that educational interventions for these
groups are effective at improving uptake (Fu, Bonhomme,
Cooper, Joseph, & Zimet, 2014). However, the use of edu-
cational interventions for school staff is a novel suggestion,
as research has not previously examined the impact of edu-
cation for this group on uptake of HPV vaccination. This is
an area that future research could usefully explore further.
The use of individualized approaches within the school
context, such as the use of electronic consent forms or pro-
viding culturally sensitive materials, may also better facil-
itate delivery of the vaccination. The use of incentives to
encourage vaccine receipt was also an approach favored by
some participants. However, there are ethical concerns
associated with incentivizing vaccination (McNaughton,
Adams, & Shucksmith, 2016), and therefore, incentivizing
vaccination consent form return instead may be a more
acceptable method. Financial incentives have shown great
promise as an approach to use to encourage consent form
return, as a means to increase vaccination uptake, with a
recent trial suggesting that it is both practical and feasible,
to offer such an incentive within the school environment
(Forster, Cornelius, et al., 2017). Although individualized
approaches are successfully used by some immunization
teams, these are not universal approaches. Further consid-
eration is needed about how sustainable such approaches
might be and whether these can be developed into workable
models of delivery.
These findings must be interpreted being mindful of the
limitations of this study. The focus groups comprised team
members who were familiar with one another, including
senior members of staff in some cases. Although the estab-
lished relationships between participants may have facili-
tated discussion, it is possible that some participants may
have been reluctant to voice their opinions on certain topics,
for fear of being judged negatively. Alternatively, some
participants may have provided answers that they perceived
to be socially acceptable within the group, rather than voi-
cing their own views, and therefore creating a social desir-
ability bias. This may also have been the case given the
involvement of NHS England (London), which commissions
and monitors performance of SAV services. However, focus
groups were conducted by a researcher external to the NHS,
and participants were reassured that their involvement in the
study was confidential. There may also have been a selection
bias in those who chose to participate in the study; it is
possible that some of those who participated did so because
they had issues or grievances that they wished to air, there-
fore providing a potentially skewed perspective of the issues
discussed. A further consideration is that while we believe
the findings of this study to be applicable and relevant to
schools throughout the United Kingdom, some of the issues
raised may only be of relevance to schools based in London.
Implications for School Nurses
Our findings suggest that barriers to delivery of the vaccina-
tion program may be minimized by nurses or program coor-
dinators attempting to educate and motivate schools
regarding the importance of HPV vaccination. However,
Rockliffe et al. 7
there is little evidence supporting the best approach to do
this, and evaluations of approaches used by school nurses
need to be documented to build an evidence base of ways to
overcome barriers to delivery of the vaccination program.
Efforts to improve consent form return, such as offering
rewards to adolescents, may also facilitate uptake.
Conclusions
Optimal delivery of the HPV vaccination program is depen-
dent on school engagement and the allocation of SAV team
time to promote uptake and completion of the vaccination
schedule. Those providing school immunization programs
should work with schools and local partners to improve
understanding and support of the HPV vaccination program.
Future research is warranted around the development of
educational training interventions for school staff, promot-
ing the importance of the vaccination.
