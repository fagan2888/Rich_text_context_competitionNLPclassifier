Forensic devices for activism: Metadata
tracking and public proof
Lonneke van der Velden
Abstract
The central topic of this paper is a mobile phone application, `InformaCam', which turns metadata from a surveillance risk
into a method for the production of public proof. InformaCam allows one to manage and delete metadata from images
and videos in order to diminish surveillance risks related to online tracking. Furthermore, it structures and stores the
metadata in such a way that the documentary material becomes better accommodated to evidentiary settings, if needed.
In this paper I propose InformaCam should be interpreted as a `forensic device'. By using the conceptualization of
forensics and work on socio-technical devices the paper discusses how InformaCam, through a range of interventions,
rearranges metadata into a technology of evidence. InformaCam explicitly recognizes mobile phones as context aware,
uses their sensors, and structures metadata in order to facilitate data analysis after images are captured. Through these
modifications it invents a form of `sensory data forensics'. By treating data in this particular way, surveillance resistance
does more than seeking awareness. It becomes engaged with investigatory practices. Considering the extent by which
states conduct metadata surveillance, the project can be seen as a timely response to the unequal distribution of power
over data.

Introduction
Increased access to digital technologies and distribution
networks has enhanced the potential for citizen jour-
nalism to monitor and report human rights abuses
(Center for Research Libraries, 2012). However, the
widespread use of these technologies, and that of
mobile devices in particular, has also raised a new set
of concerns. Firstly, these concerns relate to fears about
surveillance and security (WITNESS, 2011). Secondly,
digital reporting also raises the issue of authentication
because digital material is highly vulnerable to manipu-
lation (Center for Research Libraries, 2012: 64). This is
further complicated by the volume of images and video
that is captured and uploaded, which leads to a third
issue: a `fire hose' that needs to be sorted through,
evaluated and maintained (Center for Research
Libraries, 2012). The credibility of digital reporting is
not only an issue for activists but for (international
criminal) courts as well (The Human Rights Center at
the University of California, 2012: 13). According to
the Human Rights Electronic Evidence Study by the
Center for Research Libraries (2012: 64), `the resulting
profusion of digital documentation has created new
challenges of managing and authenticating vast
amounts of evidence, from a multitude of sources,
many of them unidentified.' Against the backdrop of
these concerns citizen journalists and human rights
activists and organisations are faced with the question
of how to investigate and document an event using
digital technologies whilst at the same time avoiding
the risks of traceability that might endanger the citizen
journalist. This paper discusses the ways in which the
InformaCam project tries to deal with these issues.

InformaCam is a mobile phone application for
managing metadata embedded in photo and video
files. It is aimed at resolving two, sometimes paradox-
ical, dimensions involved in documenting conflicts: the
need to document violence, and the need to protect
oneself from online surveillance. In one of the first art-
icles in this journal, Couldry and Powell argue that
`emerging cultures of data collection deserve to be
examined in a way that foregrounds the agency and
reflexivity of individual actors as well as the variable
ways in which power and participation are constructed
and enacted' (2014: 1). The InformaCam project is such
an example of how actors engage with data collection
and analysis for the very specific purpose of investiga-
tion and evidence production.
To highlight this investigatory dimension that is part
of anti-surveillance activism, InformaCam is intro-
duced as a `forensic device'. First of all, it is important
to stress that the term `forensic device' stems from a
particular reading of the term forensics, not as a discip-
linary practice of the forensic sciences, but as the `pro-
duction of public proof'. According to Weizman et al.:
`Etymologically, ``forensics'' is derived from a Latin
term meaning ``before the forum'' and refers to the
practice and skill of making propositions through
objects before professional and political gatherings or
courts of law' (2010: 59). In the reading of the term as
proposed by Weizman et al. the focus shifts from sci-
entific practices, which serve legal procedures, to the
skills and the (spatial) settings of evidence production
beyond the disciplinary institutions of the law only.
Secondly, the term `device' refers to a particular form
of action. A device, according to Callon and Muniesa
(2005), is a way of arranging things to make something
work. In other words, a device establishes what in
Actor Network Theory (ANT) is called a `translation'
(Latour, 1983; Law, 1992). I work in line of ANT-asso-
ciated studies on devices (Barry, 1999; Callon, 2004;
Callon and Muniesa, 2005) by looking at how connec-
tions are being made between elements from diverse
fields; in my case, these are connections between (meta)-
data and requirements from the domain of law. The
material for this case study consists of the (online) pub-
lications about the app and personal interviews with
developers of InformaCam. By not only looking at
the application itself, but by tracing the project back
to the philosophy of and writings of the developers, I
show how InformaCam is an assemblage in which tech-
nical practices are tied to the domain of the law in such
a way that something innovative emerges. In the case of
InformaCam, what is made to work is a particular form
of producing evidence with respect to digital images,
through a range of interventions. In his work on protest
sites, Andrew Barry has shown how activists re-orga-
nise public space for the demonstration of facts (Barry,
1999; Callon, 2004: 125). Analogously, I will point out
how the developers of InformaCam set the conditions
for metadata to gain evidentiary capacity. As I will
argue, InformaCam translates metadata from a poten-
tial surveillance risk into a method for the production
of public proof, and in that way, it acts as a `forensic
device'. Looking at InformaCam in this way allows one
to make explicit that activism in the context of surveil-
lance not only focuses on awareness raising and protec-
tion measures, but has an investigatory dimension as
well. Moreover, it shows how the metadata are not
ready made, nor do they speak for themselves, but
they are constructed in such a way that they gain
agency, that is, evidentiary capabilities.
In the following paragraphs, I will first explain the
basic idea behind InformaCam. Then I will provide
some background to the use of the term forensic
device. After that I will describe the metadata cate-
gories deployed in the project and the interventions
made by the developers. Concluding, I will state that
whereas metadata are initially seen as a risk, the
InformaCam project re-articulates this risky subject
matter as material that can be used for evidence
production.
What is InformaCam?
InformaCam is developed by The Guardian Project
(not to be confused with the newspaper The
Guardian). The Guardian Project is an open source
software company that helps mobile device users to
protect their communication from intrusion and moni-
toring. One of the developers describes the twofold
goals of the company as follows: `to give users control
over how much data they provide as they pass media
along the pipeline, and to increase awareness and visi-
bility of the various issues that converge around their
data as it circulates' (Holmes, 2011: 56). Part of the
project is to provide people with useful tools that can
be used by non-specialists. As stated on their website:
The Guardian Project aims to create easy to use apps,
open-source software libraries and operating system
modifications, and customized mobile devices that can
be used and deployed around the world, by any person
looking to protect their communications and personal
data from unjust intrusion and monitoring. (The
Guardian Project, 2013a).
For the InformaCam project, the developers of The
Guardian Project teamed up with WITNESS, a video
advocacy group in the context of human rights activism.
The organisation supports people to use video `safely,
ethically and effectively' (WITNESS, 2015). The project
was supported by the International Bar Association
2 Big Data & Society
(IBA). The IBA was established in 1947 and connects
more than 50,000 legal practitioners and 200 bar
associations (International Bar Association, 2015).
InformaCam is designed to support people in mana-
ging metadata that come with making images and
videos. In a general sense, metadata can be defined as
`data about data'. Metadata can be defined in a very
specified sense as well, depending on the setting in
which they play a role. In the digital context, the sim-
plest description would be data about the context in
which a file was produced, edited or stored. Metadata
can be distinguished on different levels, such as `system
metadata, file system metadata, application metadata,
document metadata, email metadata, business meta-
data, geographical metadata and many more'
(Raghavan, 2013: 101). The type of metadata that is
relevant for this article is `application metadata', data
that are embedded in the file which `describes and
moves with the file when it is moved or copied'
(Sedona, 2007: 4).1
Metadata can pose a surveillance risk. When an
image is created with a mobile phone, the image is
stored with an extra layer of information that can
include things such as the model of the phone and
GPS data. When posting images or videos online one
also uploads the metadata embedded in the file along
with it, creating an online `record', thus enabling those
with the right tools or expertise to extract the metadata
and gain certain information about the creation of the
file. This can prove highly risky for the producers of
documentary material in oppressive or security-
obsessed regimes, because they can potentially be
tracked down. (For example by connecting different
images made by the same device that is owned by a
journalist known by name or by using the GPS data
to determine the location of a person on a picture.)2
InformaCam is part of a larger project, SecureCam,
in which InformaCam's predecessor, the anti-
surveillance app ObscuraCam, allows users to remove
identifying metadata. ObscuraCam can strip metadata
and obscure faces. If somebody wishes to share an
image, ObscuraCam diminishes the chance that the
producer of the image, or the persons depicted in the
image, can be identified or located (The Guardian
Project, 2013b). Technically speaking, InformaCam is
based upon similar principles, but it makes an add-
itional and opposite move: metadata are not obscured
but deliberately captured and safely stored in case one
wants to make this information public in the future.
InformaCam enhances mobile devices with a `witness
mode', that is, an extra functionality that uses the
sensors of the mobile device in order to make the regis-
tration of contextual metadata available to, and man-
ageable for, the user. When activated, the app registers
`sensory and atmospheric data throughout the session'
(The Guardian Project, 2012). This includes data types
such as: current timestamp, user's public (PGP) key,
Image Regions created in the image/video, current
latitude and longitude, all cell IDs that are visible, alti-
tude, compass bearing, WIFI-networks (The Guardian
Project, 2012; personal communication).3 After having
made an image or video, one could add specific meta-
data about the setting in which the image was taken as
well, as for instance, information about the content and
the producer of the footage. The contextual metadata
and the annotations can be valuable for authenticating
the image.
The application therefore provides the possibility of
making two versions of the documentation: one version
is produced without the identifiable metadata and
another is safely stored with all the metadata. The
data-poor version (Figure 1) can be distributed to any
network of choice, whether that is YouTube, friends'
networks or (citizen) journalists. The data-rich
version (Figure 2) can be sent to a trusted party,

which could be for example one's own e-mail address, a
friend, or a support organisation such as WITNESS.
This happens automatically through an encrypted
channel via Tor.4
The layer of metadata and the images can be disen-
tangled when posted online, but they are stored
together if one ever needs them in court or for other
evidentiary purposes. In this way, InformaCam has
merged two of the problems mentioned at the start of
this paper, that of mobile tracking and that of digital
authentication. (The third problem, the one of sorting
through a large volume of images, will be addressed
later in the paper.) The developers have produced a
tool that allows users to take control over the circula-
tion of data by intermediating between two different
settings that have different requirements, the risky
environment of public space and the evidentiary setting
of public proof. In other words, the tool allows two
different ways of `making data public'. It is the
second setting that I will focus on now. For it is here
that the app enters the world of forensics.
Forensics as the production of public
proof
Forensics is usually understood as `forensic science'. It
refers to the scientific practices, methods and tech-
niques that are related to the investigation of crime.5
The forensic sciences are those sciences that investigate,
on behalf of the court, the principal investigator, or on
behalf of the defence (depending on the legal system),
specific material assumed to be related to a criminal
offence. The forensic sciences can offer potential evi-
dence for a decision that is subsequently to be made
by the court. Forensics are hence associated with
highly specialized laboratory work conducted by
experts that make material, which is relatively invisible
for `untrained eyes', visible for the public in court
(Jasanoff, 1998b). However, studies into how scientific
and technologically mediated data become witnessed
facts tell us that the objects of the forensic sciences
never speak for themselves. Scientific and technologic-
ally mediated data are in need of particular translations
to become convincing in the courtroom when data are
presented in front of the judge and jury (Jasanoff,
1998b: 719).
Although studies into science and law have shown
that the forensic sciences do not operate isolated from
publics or social practices (M'charek, 2008; Toom,
2010), forensics can be understood in an even broader
sense. This interpretation of forensics goes back to the
etymological understanding of the term. The Latin
word `forensis' refers to `the art of the forum'
(Forensic Architecture, 2015), and can also be trans-
lated as `public speaking'. Weizman explains how the
meaning of forensics has shifted over time:
The Roman forum to which forensics pertained was a
multidimensional space of politics, law, and economy,
but the word has since undergone a strong linguistic
drift: the forum gradually came to refer exclusively to
the court of law, and forensics to the use of medicine
and science within it. This telescoping of the term
meant that a critical dimension of the practice of foren-
sics was lost in the process of its moderniza-
tion--namely its potential as a political practice.
(Weizman, 2013: 9).
Weizman et al. (2010) speak in terms of `forensic archi-
tecture'. This reading takes the practices and settings of
evidence giving as a central point of departure ­ and
not the scientific or legal institutions. From this per-
spective, forensics refers to a relational practice in
which evidence giving can be organised and so it
widens up the range of actors and sites in which foren-
sics can arguably take place. Forensics can therefore be
reframed, as suggested by Latour (2012) in a response

to the Forensic Architecture project, as the production
of public proof.
As the practice of forensics centres around a piece of
material, the concept also invites one to take questions
concerning the relevance of this material very seriously.
To explain this point better I draw on the work by Susan
Schuppli on forensic media (forthcoming). Schuppli
shows how technical objects can contain `trace-
evidence': inscriptions of (violent) events. Her examples
include documentary material that is degraded by radi-
ation (Chernobyl documentary by Shevchenko in 1986),
film material that has been copied and edited (the `Loshi
video' depicting a massacre in Kosovo in 1999; for an
analysis see Schuppli, 2014), and video footage that has
metadata embedded (an anonymous execution video
shot in Sri Lanka in 2009). In her framing, the object
becomes `informed material', a term inspired by the
philosopher of science Isabelle Stengers, and it denotes
the way `their internal composition is enriched by infor-
mation' (Schuppli, 2013). Such material can depict
events not only in representative terms, but the mater-
ials themselves become enriched as well through the
inscriptions along the way. Schuppli shows the different
ways in which matter that has archived traces of events
articulates itself as a witness of these events. Her con-
cern is with how matter that is `informed' takes on the
role of a witness, that is, how matter can speak and
testify. She uses the concept of `material witness' as an
operative concept to describe the process by which that
happens. This term is rooted in legal jargon (from the
US context). When a witness becomes `material' to a
case it means it holds crucial information (Leonardi,
2010). In Schuppli's case studies, the question about
the material witness becomes one that is concerned
with the inscriptions being made along the trajectory
of material becoming a piece of relevant evidence.
These inscriptions can be accidental influences, but
they can also be legal formats with which materials
need to comply in order to gain credibility in court.
What I take from the reading of `forensics' as pro-
posed by Weizman et al. is the displacement of forensic
practices, which allows one to grasp the participation of
actors other than scientists and lawyers in the investi-
gation of affairs. Schuppli's work directs attention to
how material, including digital material, changes along
a trajectory and how that requires us to rethink pro-
cedures of evidence giving. InformaCam is concerned
with practices of archiving trace evidence and with
the issue of how to make documentary material rele-
vant through particular inscriptions. However,
InformaCam is also an experimental application: it is,
at the time of writing, `in the making'. That also means
that it does not (yet) deal with passed events that it can
document. In fact, it is the organisation of public proof
in future that the application directs itself towards. It is
also the organisation of public proof about which
ANT-scholars have produced fruitful studies.
Devices for arranging the production of
public proof
Classic examples of ways to organise public proof are
legal trials and scientific demonstrations (Jasanoff,
1998b; Latour, 1983; Shapin and Shaffer, 1985).
These are endeavours, or `devices' as in social-material
arrangements, constructed to prove particular states of
affairs. These devices require solidity because they build
on rules or protocols that stay more or less the same
and which allow a replication of testing and decision
making (Callon, 2004: 125). A less procedural way of
thinking about public proofs, and therefore relevant to
this case study, is Andrew Barry's understanding of the
`demonstration' (1999). Barry starts with drawing an
analogy between scientific demonstrations and political
demonstrations. The scientific demonstration has
always been an important object of study in science
studies. These studies have shown that scientific dem-
onstrations heavily depend on the participation of wit-
nesses and controlled behaviour, and thus, on a
controlled public space (Epstein, 1995; Latour, 1983;
Shapin and Schaffer, 1985). According to Barry, polit-
ical demonstrations share a family resemblance with
scientific demonstrations because they require a similar
reorganisation of public space. In Barry's understand-
ing, `to conduct a political demonstration can be a
matter of making visible a phenomenon to be witnessed
by others' (1999, 77).
One of Barry's examples is an extra-parliamentary
action: an occupation in a forest against potential road
constructions. The site of the occupation, the land-
scape, was not just the background for the protest.
As a `setting' it became part of the protest itself because
it exposed a potential truth claimed by the protesters. It
showed `the fact that humans, land were mutually
implicated' (1999: 81) and the emerging reality of envir-
onmental destruction. In this way, the activists crafted
a space in which there emerged something to point to.
As can be taken from the title of Barry's piece, `site' and
`sight' become interconnected. Barry describes at length
the style of conflict resolution between the activists, the
literature they produced and the material and social
discipline needed to organise the camp. He also
describes how the protest involved an `art of demon-
stration' and a careful orchestration of how (electronic)
media participate in the way the demonstration is
witnessed.
In sum, Barry shows that devices for public proof
can also be displaced from the formal arenas of public
proof giving. At the same time he describes that,
although these settings might be less protocolised,
van der Velden 5
spaces for public proof giving still need a lot of work to
be established. Barry's take on the matter provides
useful pointers for analysing InformaCam. The
InformaCam project is, in an experimental way,
involved with a range of interventions through which
it tries to establish such spaces and connections. Thus,
in line with more `formal devices' such as the trial and
the experiment, InformaCam can also be seen as a
device that is engaged with creating the conditions for
the production of public proof. As InformaCam is
experimental, it provides insights into how a forensic
device is being set up.
Enriching and ordering metadata
As will be explained in more detail, the InformaCam
project turns metadata from a risky matter of surveil-
lance into something that is expected to have evidential
value. Metadata can have evidential value because
`[m]etadata refers to data about the data that is
stored within a source of digital evidence' (Raghavan,
2013: 101). Metadata offer a narrative potential: a piece
of evidence can tell something about itself through its
metadata because contextual information is captured
within the (digital) object itself. However, as mentioned
earlier, data often need narrative techniques to become
witnessed as facts. Framed in more philosophical terms,
following Schuppli (forthcoming), capturing data by
which material becomes `informed' is not always suffi-
cient to turn it into a `witness': the material has to be
able to articulate its relevance to a case. Similarly,
InformaCam does more than merely `capturing' data.
The specific way by which data are captured and orga-
nised is crucial for turning it into a witnessing machine.
The following paragraph describes in more detail
through which categories the InformaCam project
organises code and why. It also shows how software
developers draw together concepts about digital net-
works, law and ethical perspectives, into the same
project.
The lead developer of the project, Harlo Holmes,
reflects upon The Guardian Project's app development
in her master's thesis. She describes how EXIF data
contain various specified fields and allow for free com-
ments. EXIF stands for `Exchangeable image file
format' and is the standard used for specifying and
annotating image files by digital cameras. She argues
that a large amount of the EXIF data fields are filled up
with intellectual property data. Referring to
Manovich's concept of `cultural transcoding', a concept
that addresses the translation of cultural formats into
computer code (Manovich, 2001: 64), she states that:
The EXIF specification's treatment of the copyright tag
is a remarkable example of the process of `cultural
transcoding' posited by Lev Manovich. In the specifi-
cation, the EXIF tag descriptions are usually no more
than 3 lines in length; the copyright section, however,
occupies quadruple the space. (Holmes, 2011: 30)
It is this insight, that metadata are formatted in relation
to an intellectual property regime, that for Holmes
opens up the question about possible alignments with
other regimes ­ such as that of human rights. If EXIF
metadata take part in a particular material legal cul-
ture, why wouldn't this be extended to other domains
of legal culture as well? Holmes refers as well to the
anthropological research of Gabriella Coleman on
how software developers approach code and intellec-
tual property law. Coleman has shown how the soft-
ware community has contributed to a form of
`jurisgenesis' (2009: 421). The concept of jurisgenesis,
originally defined by Robert Cover in 1983, refers to
`the collective construction of new legal meanings and
artefacts that diverge from statist or dominant inter-
pretations of the law' (Coleman, 2009: 421). Holmes
situates The Guardian Project's app development in
this context. She states: `This interaction with justice
through technology can be viewed as a form of digitally
enabled jurisgenesis' (Holmes, 2011: 57). But in her
view `technological laws' undergo similar processes of
re-appropriation:
Obscura openly challenges the law of the smartphone
by overriding its unencrypted media database and by
allowing users to rein control over the embedded EXIF
data. To interact with the app encourages direct expos-
ure to the new laws of images, allowing users to actively
participate in the politics newly embedded into the
photographic act. (Holmes, 2011: 57­58)
One can now begin to sense how Holmes and her co-
developers creatively appropriate the role of metadata
by reaching out to formats that are directed at eviden-
tiary settings. In making this move, the developers
relate to the human rights arena specifically.
The interaction between human rights and software
is of central concern to the Project Director of
WITNESS (which is the NGO that collaborates on
InformaCam), Sam Gregory. Gregory (2012) presents
some of his ideas in a publication that discusses alter-
native ways of making human rights visible. One exam-
ple is a proposal for a new kind of licensing system, one
that `recognizes intentionality'. His proposal is to give a
twist to digital material, but one that is different from
copyright or Creative Commons licenses that deal with
intellectual property rights and the possibility for
remixing. His type of license would embed a proposed
human rights use into the metadata. His second exam-
ple relates to rethinking witnessing in the digital age `in
6 Big Data & Society
line with the primary principle that every human being
is possessed of ``inherent dignity'' ­ a concept that runs
through every right included in the UDHR' (2010: 11).
An important concern in this context is the avoidance
of re-victimization of victims on film through the wide-
spread circulation of media. Gregory continues to
argue that this comes with an ethical obligation for
the one who is witnessing to do so carefully with respect
for the victim: `Contemporary thinking on testimony,
witnessing and trauma also places a heavy emphasis on
the responsibility of the witness to abuse to represent it
responsibly and with ethical integrity ­ to be, so to
speak, the ``ethical witness''' (2010: 11­12). WITNESS
wants to contribute to ethical forms of witnessing by
translating professional notions of informed consent
(inspired by medical practices, social science and inter-
national human rights and humanitarian law) into the
practice of technological devices (2010: 12).6
InformaCam is an implementation of some of the
ideas mentioned above. This is done by what one
could call `enriching metadata': InformaCam structures
how metadata are embedded in the image. An (early)
blog post on the project mentions four metadata cate-
gories: Data, Consent, Intent, Genealogy.7 The cat-
egory `Data' sounds very general, but it represents the
data that `captures the moment of capture'. As
explained by The Guardian Project's website: `This cat-
egory includes all standard metadata (timestamp,
acquired sensory data, location and movement data)
that have been collected during the lifetime of the
image, from the moment it was opened to the instant
it was saved' (The Guardian Project, 2012).
InformaCam does not capture traffic but only publicly
visible identifiers. `Consent' resonates most explicitly
with human rights culture. A user of the application
can add free text to images indicating whether the sub-
ject has given consent to be filmed. As touched upon
earlier, the approach of WITNESS is to translate ideas
of consent into technical devices, by for example tools
giving `prompts on consent during those filming/upload
processes' (Gregory, 2010: 15). This is an implementa-
tion thereof. `Intent' is more experimental and is dir-
ected to the circulation of digital material. It indicates
`information about the media's creator and the permis-
sions for sharing' (The Guardian Project, 2012), and
could therefore be considered as a materialisation of
what Gregory (2012) proposed: `a licensing system
that recognizes intentionality'. This `tag of intent' will
say something about what kind of `use' the producer
envisions with a particular digital object and is an
attempt to create `human rights media' as a particular
piece of media and bring that into circulation (Gregory,
2013, personal communication). `Genealogy' refers to
the main indicator of the chain of custody (or `data
integrity', which means that data should be left in tact
until it reaches the court). This is addressed through a
digital hash embedded into the file on the moment the
image was made to indicate its original state.8
Besides these main categories, the developers make
use of an ordering device entitled J3M (JSON
Evidentiary Mobile Media Metadata), which is
described as `a format that can be used to easily
describe the origins, context, and content of any
image or video taken with a mobile device' (j3m.info,
2013). This is to be understood as a way of structuring
metadata. The aim of J3M is to:
[m]aintain a trusted record of a media object's chain-of-
custody (. . .); Express the context surrounding the
media object's capture (. . .); Embed extra user input
from forms or surveys into the media object as signed
metadata (. . .); Provide metrics for analyzing the con-
tent of the media object to mathematically determine
that it was created by the device indicated in its meta-
data. (j3m.info, 2013).
Figure 3 is an example of what this would look like in
code. Technical specifications are given on the website
of the Guardian Project including a java library to help
developers to use J3M.
The above mentioned categories and J3M show a
first insight into how the people involved with
InformaCam actively shape metadata. They do so in
a way that would help forms of narration firstly with
respect to the context of the event, secondly with
respect to the content of the material, the relation
between the producer of the image and the people
depicted, and, finally, his or her relation with the digital
object itself. It is an example of an emerging culture of

data collection in which actors on the ground exercise
their agency by constructing and curating data for par-
ticular purposes (Couldry and Powell, 2014).
Organising conditions of public proof
At the time of writing, InformaCam just released its
beta-implementation. Therefore, real life experiences
of how InformaCam is put into use are not yet avail-
able. However, InformaCam allows for organising the
settings for the production of public proof in multiple
ways. I discuss three of these ways below.
A first intervention has already been discussed,
which consists of tying images to regimes of evidence.
As highlighted in the previous paragraph, the cate-
gories of InformaCam show how the project developers
pull in different kind of formats into the application.
The chain of custody, an important issue for investiga-
tory purposes in legal settings, is accommodated with a
digital hash that J3M embeds in the file. In addition,
notions of ethical witnessing from the human rights
arena are redesigned as an awareness prompt. In this
way, in Holmes' words, the developers are `ingraining'
categories borrowed from legal and human rights dis-
course into the metadata (Holmes, 2013, personal com-
munication). It is interesting to see how these
inscriptions organise the capturing of data before the
images are even being made. This has its analogy in
other legal practices. In his work on the workings of
law (2010), Latour explains how, in the context of the
French Council of State, some (governmental) docu-
ments are prepared for legal use before being used in
a legal setting. They are, in other words, already `pro-
filed' before making it to the court. Files, according to
Latour, are `made ripe for use' (2010, 70). The oper-
ation of law, he argues, cannot be understood without
these preparations. Similarly, software developers are
undertaking preparatory work to `ripen up' digital
data for legal use.
Whether this material will make it in the end to the
international human rights courts is most difficult to
foresee. In the context of this discussion, it is import-
ant to take note of the different legal systems with
respect to the admission and evaluation of evidence
(Jasanoff, 1998a; Van Koppen, 2007). In the adversar-
ial system in the United States exist specified legal
requirements with respect to scientific evidence (the
Daubert Criteria).9 It has been claimed that these
admissibility rules, together with the litigation struc-
ture in the United States, provide opportunities for the
critical evaluation of science and technology, espe-
cially when compared to inquisitorial systems found
in many continental countries (Jasanoff, 1998a; Van
Koppen, 2007). In inquisitorial systems, the prosecu-
tor is responsible for the `dossier work' and the
admissibility of scientific and technological data is
less subject to public discussion in the courts.
International human rights courts consist of a mixture
of legal systems, but tend to follow civil (continental)
law in relation to the admission of evidence. This
implies that the threshold for the admissibility of evi-
dence is low. With respect to electronic evidence the
international tribunals require no particular standards
and in terms of admissibility trial chambers are rela-
tively free in their assessment (O'Neill et al., 2011).
The rules for (electronic) documentary evidence there-
fore vary from court to court and the development of
standards proceeds very slowly (Center for Research
Libraries, 2012: 65): `[R]equirements are better estab-
lished for national and local courts than for inter-
national courts and tribunals' (Center for Research
Libraries, 2012: 51). In their review of a series of
human rights O'Neill et al. state that `procedural
rules at international courts and tribunals offer little
guidance on what must be shown to authenticate new
forms of E-evidence' (2011: 9).10 The number of cases
in which metadata have played a role is still rather
limited, and hence there is little case law to draw con-
clusions from about what to expect in the near future.
A request by the International Criminal Court
Prosecutor for a protocol for `born-electronic evi-
dence' was denied by the Chamber (O'Neill et al.,
2011: 51). However, as explained in the same report
(p. 42), the authentication of e-evidence can play an
important role in opening up investigations into
human rights violations. Despite the lack of existing
standards, there is a realization that they might
develop in the years to come. According to the
authors of the same review, the potential future devel-
opment of restrictive demands concerning e-evidence,
which might be inspired by the more extensively docu-
mented (commercial) US litigation context, could be
dangerous for international human rights proceedings,
since the burden placed on people bringing in evidence
may preclude those without access to equipment of
sufficiently high standards. That is the reason why
InformaCam is a significant project: whereas require-
ments for metadata in the legal domain of inter-
national human rights procedures are not yet
defined, the developers of the project are already
working towards developing a specific socio-technolo-
gical standard of which they hope it will also become
accessible for activists.
In this context it is important to know that The
Guardian project will soon launch the InformaCam
system as the `CameraV App'.11 And in June 2015 the
IBA launched a spin-off called `Eyewitness for Atrocities
App'. This app is built on the open source implementa-
tion that was made in collaboration with the Guardian
Project. That means that the concepts behind the project
8 Big Data & Society
are now being brought into practice. Next to offering
the tools, the developers of InformaCam do also try to
find ways to familiarize courts with their techniques.
According to Sam Gregory, they are looking for what
they call `demonstration projects' that can help demon-
strate the evidentiary value and applicability of J3M
data and the InformaCam project (Gregory, 2013, per-
sonal communication). At the same time they are aware
of the dangers of putting a very heavy weight on people
bringing in evidence whilst not everybody has access to
the right equipment to secure such standards: `We're
also cautious though not to create a situation where
there is an insistence on extra metadata for proof since
we know that there will be many contexts where valuable
evidence is missing this' (Gregory, 2013, personal
communication).
A second intervention is related to the insight that
mobile devices have capabilities that can organise forms
of witnessing on the ground. Through Bluetooth the
app can detect other devices that have InformaCam
activated nearby. In this way the app can show that
multiple devices were present at the same place at the
same time, or that people have made similar documen-
tation at the same time with regard to the same event
(Holmes, 2013, personal communication). One poten-
tial user group is the Georgia Legal Services Program
that helps migrant workers (Making Cameras Count,
2013). It happens that bosses deny that people came to
work, leaving workers without payment. It is for such
situations that InformaCam could mobilize self-
tracking: through the simultaneous use of Bluetooth
detection, people would be able to try to prove their
presence, or at least that of their phones. Therefore, the
application does not only aim to produce images of
events, it would also put oneself, or one's collective,
on the map. So one way in which InformaCam invites
material to become more `informed' is by capturing
(collective) presence. It captures not only contextual
metadata that refers to location, device number, etc.,
but it enacts a collective body of witnesses. Figure 4 is
an example of how the presence of devices can be
mapped through Bluetooth.
With a third intervention, the J3M-library makes a
particular form of forensic data analysis possible.
According to Harlo Holmes, it is not the app itself
that she expects to do all the work: it is the openly
available library that opens up the perspective to dis-
tribute J3M to other applications and platforms such as
YouTube (Holmes, 2013, personal communication).12
Gregory adds that the distribution of J3M into the
public domain aims to open up research possibilities
through J3M itself. The library is inscribed into the
files and subsequently read out again. So the device
works by structuring data in such a way that material
can be pulled together after capturing it. According to
Gregory, multiple J3Msources embedded in
InformaCam material can be used for timeline mapping
and comparison between multiple angles. It could
enhance constructing a chain of explanation of what
happened in an event (2013, personal communication).
There are already several projects that map events on
the basis of (EXIF) metadata online. See for instance
`The Rashomon Project', an open-source online toolkit
that assembles and analyses videos and photos from
`contested events'. Their aim is to enhance a nuanced
understanding by providing multi-perspective timelines

van der Velden 9
and interactive viewing features (The Rashomon
Project, 2015). The approach of the InformaCam devel-
opers is therefore an example of how actors `on the
ground' challenge `conventional data collection'
(Couldry and Powell, 2014: 4). Figure 5 below presents
the InformaCam System Architecture. From the left to
the right it shows the app, the two versions of the docu-
mentary material that the app produces, the methods
for verification, and lastly, the analysis dimension in the
project (`J3MScan Advanced Search and Analysis').
A forensic device for activism
InformaCam takes part in an emerging trend of pro-
jects that aim to enhance the verification of online
information. There exist websites for tracking users'
location footprint on the basis of GPS data, tools
for revealing EXIF data attached to images, and tools
for showing whether images have been altered. (See, for
instance, the website of the Verification Handbook for
an overview (Silverman, 2014).) On the other side of the
spectrum there are plenty of tools that help users to
protect their identity, to browse anonymously or to
securely encrypt their data. (See for instance, http://
prism-break.org.) According to the developers,
InformaCam is, as far as they know, the only app
that combines this many capabilities (`enhanced meta-
data through sensors, cryptographic verification/hash-
ing/signing, secure storage and transmission') and that
is offered as a free and open source app that runs on
inexpensive smartphones (Freitas, 2013, personal
communication).
Moreover, InformaCam is prefigurative to legal
standards. As mentioned earlier in the paper,
Andrew Barry has shown how activists can be
involved in carefully modifying and constructing
spaces that allow proof to emerge, and how they
can invent new forms of demonstration. The actors
involved with the InformaCam project do a similar
thing with respect to networked technologies. They
actively engage with how data can be handled by
making InformaCam intervene in different parts in
the trajectory of an image. By transcribing law into
code before the event, controlling how data is cap-
tured on the ground, and by the enhancing research
capabilities for post-event analysis, the InformaCam
project invents a form of what we could call `sensory
data forensics'. Mobile phones, sensory data, users'
interaction with technology, legal formats and code
are tuned in such a way that together they allow for
the production of public proof, and hence operate as a
forensic `device' in the ANT sense of the word. It also
indicates a medium-specific collaborative practice to
witnessing, which can be better understood when
taking into consideration that particular software
communities have particular approaches to code
(Coleman, 2009; Kelty, 2008). The people behind
InformaCam are not waiting until jurisprudence
catches up with new evidentiary modes, but are
already intervening through the media landscape.

10 Big Data & Society
There seems to be a paradox to the idea that images
should remain `in tact' to retain the chain of custody
on the one hand and the practice of adding data-points
to structure images for analysis on the other hand.
But as we can read in the work of Kelly Gates, this
paradox characterizes the practice of video forensics
by forensic experts as well. Looking at the disciplinary
practice of video forensics in particular, Gates describes
how in preparing CCTV video material, forensic inves-
tigators use narrative techniques such as annotating,
zooming and composing timelines, sometimes with the
use of sophisticated software. Metadata can also be
attached to images to enhance search and retrieval
and cross-referencing (2013: 251; 255). As Gates
critically points out, the practice of video forensics
points to a new conceptualization of (computational)
objectivity:
Here I want to suggest that the use of digital imaging
technologies to make visible what is invisible and invest
images with indexicality points to a new conceptualiza-
tion of objectivity. This way of thinking about object-
ivity holds that neutral, scientific results can be
achieved through the application of computational
forms of analysis ­ automated, algorithmic techniques
performed by computers. (2013: 252.)
Just like forensic investigators, the developers of
InformaCam invest images with indexicality to condi-
tion computational analysis. Whether projects such as
InformaCam, just like forensic state investigators, also
participate in the establishment of what Gates calls a
`computational objectivity' (Gates, 2013: 252) would be
an interesting topic for future research. Especially
because the developers don't hide the fact that the com-
putational analysis of data requires an extensive prep-
aration including choices, concepts and ethics.
Concluding remarks
The InformaCam project signals an innovative way of
thinking about surveillance risks: surveillance risk is
not just something to be `informed of' or to be avoided;
it is something that can be hacked in order to become
an empirical object. The project has re-articulated
what used to be a problem into its working material.
For the people involved in the InformaCam project,
the circulation of data is a problem but at the same
time it is material that can be analysed and used for
other things.
InformaCam shows in what direction activism in the
context of surveillance can develop. It seems to do away
with the gaze as a central organising principle. Instead
of being primarily concerned with what can be seen (on
an image), the project shows how attention shifts to the
`art of looking', which is concerned with how to organ-
ise which data counts (including one's own position,
location, etc.). In short, it becomes engaged with inves-
tigatory practices through code. It is what Thomas
Keenan (inspired by the use of the concept by the pho-
tographer Sekula) calls `counter-forensics'. This con-
cept refers not to countering forensic investigations,
but to the tactical adoption of forensics in the context
of activist struggles (Keenan, 2014: 69).13
This investigatory dimension raises a few critical ques-
tions: Doesn't the project become too much of a surveil-
lance project itself? Doesn't it perform analytic work in
service of authorities that attempt to monitor people? Do
people who use this tool, by collectively mapping events
and their devices, endanger themselves? When asked
about this, Harlo Holmes admitted this constitutes a
potential risk, but she also argued that many states
have access to this kind of data already (as
InformaCam captures only public data) and many
people are not aware of it yet. She regarded using
InformaCam as taking a step forward in terms of the
`equality of arms' (Holmes, 2013, personal communica-
tion). Recent developments have underlined the invasive-
ness of state surveillance. The National Security Agency
(NSA)-disclosures by Edward Snowden in 2013
(Greenwald, 2014) have shown that the NSA uses many
techniques for metadata analysis. This includes pro-
grammes such as `HAPPYFOOT' for collecting mobile
phone location data and `Co-Traveler Analytics', which
detects devices being present together at particular loca-
tions (Soltani and Gellman, 2013). Tools such as
InformaCam, therefore, can be seen as a timely response
to the unequal distribution of power over data.

Notes
1. Application metadata is often contrasted with system
metadata: ```system metadata'' is not embedded within
the file it describes but stored externally. System
van der Velden 11
metadata is used by the computer's file system to track
file locations and store information about each file's
name, size, creation, modification, and usage' (Sedona,
2007: 4).
2. A famous example: John McAfee's location was revealed
accidently by Vice Magazine through the location data
embedded in the photo (Honan, 2012).
3. Current timestamp: record date/time; User's public
(PGP) key: algorithmically generated key that functions
as a digital signature; Image Regions created in the
image/video: user-demarcated regions in the visual
image (or: Regions of Interest) Current latitude & longi-
tude: geographical coordinates; Cell ID: Identification
GSM base station; Altitude: (vertical) distance measure-
ment; Compass bearing: orientation camera; WIFI: wire-
less local area network.
4. Tor is a free software and open network also known as
`onion routing' used for anonymous browsing. Data
packets travel through virtual tunnels in such a way
that a receiver only knows one node it is communicating
with, but not the one before or after the neighbouring
one. Therefore, the trajectory of communication between
sender and receiver is obfuscated. Communication at the
end nodes is not encrypted (TOR, 2015).

6. Whilst acknowledging that full informed consent can
never be assured, and training and the provision of train-
ing material is invaluable (Gregory, 2010: 15).
7. It is good to keep in mind that these are working concepts
and InformaCam will have different deployments for dif-
ferent settings, so not all of them will be implemented in
final use.
8. Please note that in the end, the data integrity should be
decided upon by an analyst reviewing the J3M-data
(Gregory, 2013, personal communication).
9. These requirements were formulated in the landmark
1993 decision on Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which determined the admissibility
standards for scientific evidence in court, giving the judge
greater agency in determining the validity of the testi-
mony of the expert witness. See the website of the Legal
Information Institute (2013).

13. If situated in a different theoretical framework, one could
as well analyze the project as a form of `sousveillance'
(Mann et al., 2003), as a set of `grassroots' surveillance
practices. However, because the project very explicitly
aims at proof giving (and not at the monitoring of popu-
lations in the Foucauldian sense), I prefer the vocabulary
of forensics, despite the fact that the notion of sousveil-
lance does not exclude instances of evidence production
(Mann et al., 2003: 333).
