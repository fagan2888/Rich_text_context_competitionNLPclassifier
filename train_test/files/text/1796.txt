Objective. Chronic pain is a common reason for seeking medical care. We estimated the prevalence
of chronic regional and widespread pain in the United States population overall, and by age, sex, and
race/ethnicity.
Setting. We examined the data from 10,291 respondents who participated in the 1999­2002
NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and completed a pain question-
naire. Items allowed classification of chronic (3 months) pain as regional or widespread. We used
regression models to test the association of sex and race/ethnicity with each pain outcome, adjusting
for age.
Results. Chronic pain prevalence estimates were 10.1% for back pain, 7.1% for pain in the legs/feet,
4.1% for pain in the arms/hands, and 3.5% for headache. Chronic regional and widespread pain
were reported by 11.0% and 3.6% of respondents, respectively. Women had higher odds than men
for headache, abdominal pain, and chronic widespread pain. Mexican-Americans had lower odds
compared with non-Hispanic whites and blacks for chronic back pain, legs/feet pain, arms/hands
pain, and regional and widespread pain.
Conclusion. The population prevalence of chronic pain in the United States was lower than previ-
ously reported, with smaller sex-related differences and some variation by race/ethnicity.

Introduction
Chronic localized and widespread pain affect
about 50% and about 10% of Americans,
respectively [1,2]. It is, therefore, not surprising
that chronic pain is the most common symptom
for which patients seek medical care [3]. Chronic
pain is associated with substantial psychological
distress, functional impairment, and disability
[4­6]. For example, chronic back pain is one of the
major causes of absence from work in people
under 45 years of age [7], and over a quarter of
patients with chronic widespread pain receive
some form of disability or injury compensation [8].
In the United States, 13% of the working popula-
tion experienced pain in the last 2 weeks that
reduced their ability to work [9], and chronic pain
results in an estimated annual $61bn of lost pro-
ductivity [9]. Although there are some successful
treatments for chronic pain caused by cancer,
treatment for other chronic pain is often difficult
and unsuccessful [10­12]. This is especially true
for chronic widespread pain [13].
Reviews of the literature have documented
striking variations in the prevalence of chronic
pain all over the world (e.g., [6,14]), including a
World Health Organization multicenter study
that reported baseline estimates of nonminor pain
ranging from 5% to 41% for women and from 4%
to 29% for men [15,16]. In addition to variations
between different countries, prevalence estimates
are heavily influenced by the methods used to
assess pain and the conditions under which data

are collected. For example, telephone surveys tend
to result in lower rates of pain than mailed ques-
tionnaires [17­20]. Self-reported pain in the
United States also differs by race and ethnicity,
with most studies showing higher rates of pain for
African Americans compared with non-Hispanic
white people [21­23], but lower rates in African
Americans and Hispanics have also been reported
[2]. The underlying reasons for this variation are
not well understood [24,25]. A study examining
four methods of experimentally induced pain did
not detect any difference in the pain threshold
between African Americans, Hispanics, and non-
Hispanic white people, although pain tolerance
was somewhat higher in the latter group [26]. For
example, non-Hispanic white people left their
hands in very cold water (5°C) for an average of 47
seconds, compared with 42 seconds for African
Americans and Hispanics. Most likely, a variety of
cultural, socioeconomic, and biological factors, as
well as interactions with the health care system,
converge to affect the pain experience among
Americans [24,25].
Previous population-based estimates of pain
in the United States have relied on data from
the National Health and Nutrition Survey
(NHANES), a series of surveys initiated in 1971 to
assemble national data on health and nutrition
outcomes. Based on the NHANES data collected
from 1971 to 1975, the overall population preva-
lence of musculoskeletal or joint pain lasting 1
month during the previous year was estimated at
14% [27]. When the same cohort was reinter-
viewed 8­10 years later, the prevalence of muscu-
loskeletal or joint pain was 20%, with higher rates
in women than men, and in older compared with
younger respondents [28]. No differences by race/
ethnicity were noted in either analysis. We used
NHANES data from 1999 to 2002 to estimate the
population prevalence of nonminor chronic local-
ized and widespread pain in the United States, and
to examine whether the pattern of chronic pain
differs by age, sex, or race/ethnicity.
Methods
Survey and Sample
The NHANES is a series of large population-
based health surveys that have been administered
to representative samples of Americans since 1971
and made available for public use. All surveys
have oversampled racial/ethnic minorities to
ensure adequate representation in the datasets, but
the NHANES does not oversample women. The
first three surveys are referred to as NHANES I
(1971­1975), NHANES II (1976­1980), and
NHANES III (1988­1994). Since 1999,
NHANES has been administered continuously,
with data released to the public every 2 years.
From 1999 to 2002, a random subsample of 10,291
respondents 20 years old completed an addi-
tional miscellaneous pain questionnaire in English
through personal interviews. With respect to sex,
age, socioeconomic status, and rural vs urban resi-
dence, the NHANES is a representative sample of
the general United States population, with an
oversampling of ethnic minorities. It should be
noted, however, that the NHANES is a household
survey, and institutionalized subjects are excluded.
In addition, homeless people and households
without telephones are less likely to be included.
The miscellaneous pain questionnaire, the dataset,
and further details about the 1999­2002
NHANES cohorts are available at http://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.
Demographics
The 1999­2002 NHANES data include self-
report information on age in years, sex, and race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white people, African
American, Mexican-American, and Other). The
Other category includes non-Mexican Hispanics,
people reporting >1 race/ethnicity, and diverse
small subgroups with insufficient numbers for reli-
able analysis. We have included the Other cat-
egory primarily to provide complete data [29].
Assessment of Pain
The miscellaneous pain questionnaire collected
information on the location and duration of self-
reported pain. Respondents were first asked if they
had a problem with pain within the last month
(yes/no). Those endorsing pain were asked about
the duration of the pain (<1 month, 1 month but
<3 months, 3 months but <1 year, 1 year), and
which of 32 body regions were affected. They were
instructed to only report pain that lasted 24 hours
and was not "fleeting or minor." For this analysis,
we defined chronic pain according to the American
College of Rheumatology criteria as pain of 3
months duration [4]. Hence, all outcomes in this
analysis refer to current, chronic, nonminor pain.
We analyzed the following seven specific pain
locations from the miscellaneous pain question-
naire: [1] back pain (lower back, upper back, spine,
shoulder, and neck) [2], pain in the legs/feet [3],
pain in the arms/hands [4], headache [5], abdomi-
nal pain [6], pain in the face/teeth, and [7] chest

pain. These seven NHANES pain location out-
comes were coded as binary variables (present/not
present). Additionally, we created a three-level
variable based on American College of Rheuma-
tology criteria (no chronic pain, localized but not
widespread pain, widespread pain) [4]. Localized
pain was defined as pain in 1 of the 32 body
regions that did not meet the American College of
Rheumatology criteria for widespread pain. Pain
was classified as widespread if it was experienced
above and below the waist, on both sides of the
body, and at 1 axial location (spine, chest, upper
or lower back). The full wording of the question-
naire is available on the Internet ([30], and a short
version is provided as an appendix).
Statistical Analyses
We calculated unweighted means and percents to
describe the demographic and pain outcomes for
the NHANES sample, and weighted means and
percents to make inferences to the total United
States population. We also described all pain out-
comes stratified by sex and race/ethnicity, and
calculated prevalence estimates for the seven
NHANES localized pain locations and three
American College of Rheumatology pain types
stratified by 10-year age categories and sex. All
inferential prevalence rates and means are pre-
sented as point estimates with 95% confidence
intervals.
We used regression models to test the associa-
tion of sex and race/ethnicity with each pain
outcome, adjusting for age. Because previous
research has suggested a nonlinear relationship
between age and pain [31], we included a quadratic
term for age in all models. Men were the reference
category for sex comparisons, and the non-
Hispanic white group was the reference category
for race/ethnicity comparisons. We used binary
logistic regression to evaluate the association of
sex and race/ethnicity for the seven binary
NHANES pain location outcomes, and multino-
mial logistic regression for the three-category
American College of Rheumatology pain type
outcome. We considered an a rate of 0.05 as the
threshold for statistical significance.
We weighted the data using the 4-year (1999­
2002) weight strata and masked variance units
(pseudo-primary sampling unit [PSU]) variables
available in the NHANES public release data. All
analyses were conducted with the SVY commands
in Stata version 8.1 [32], which use the Taylor
series method to calculate properly weighted vari-
ance estimates for the general population.
Results
Twenty cases were excluded due to incomplete
data, leaving 10,271 subjects for analysis. Table 1
shows the unweighted demographic and chronic
pain characteristics of the respondents who com-
pleted the miscellaneous pain questionnaire,
and the weighted inferential statistics for the
U.S. general population. The unweighted age and
sex distributions in the sample were similar to
the weighted population estimates. NHANES
respondents were, on average, 50 years old, com-
pared with a population mean of 45 years of age.
Approximately 50% of respondents and of the
overall population were female. Due to the over-
sampling of racial/ethnic minorities, the sample
contained higher percentages of black people
(19% vs 11%), Mexican-Americans (23% vs 7%),
and a lower percentage of white people (50% vs
72%) than the general population. The highest
population prevalence estimates for the seven
NHANES pain location outcomes occurred for
back (10%) and legs/feet (7%), followed by arms/
hands and headache (both 4%). Abdominal, face/
teeth, and chest pain had the lowest prevalence

Prevalence of Chronic Pain in the United States 805
(all 1%). The population prevalence estimates for
chronic widespread and chronic localized pain
were 4% and 11%, respectively.
Table 2 reports the population prevalence esti-
mates for the NHANES pain location and Ameri-
can College of Rheumatology pain type, stratified
by race/ethnicity within sex. In general, Mexican-
Americans had a lower prevalence than other
racial/ethnic groups. The NHANES pain location
outcomes for both men and women were lower
among Mexican-Americans than among non-
Hispanic white people and non-Hispanic black
people for back pain, pain in the legs/feet, and pain
in the arms/hands. For the American College
of Rheumatology pain types, Mexican-American
women and men had a lower prevalence of both
chronic localized and chronic widespread pain
than non-Hispanic white and black people. Point
estimates of localized and widespread chronic pain
were lower in non-Hispanic black people than in
non-Hispanic white people, except for chronic
widespread pain in men.
Table 3 shows the results of the logistic regres-
sion models for the pain outcomes, simultaneously
adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, and age. Women
had higher odds than men for all pain sites, but
these were statistically significant only for head-
ache, abdominal pain, and chronic widespread
pain. Mexican-Americans had lower odds for all
pain outcomes compared with the other races.
The differences were statistically significant com-
pared with non-Hispanic white and black people
for chronic back pain, pain in the legs/feet, and
pain in the arms/hands, as well as for chronic
localized and widespread pain.
A nonlinear age effect was evident in all pain
outcomes except for those with very low preva-
lence estimates (abdomen, face/teeth, and chest).
In general, pain rates increased up to 50­59 years
of age, then declined for people 60 years of age
and older. The exception to this pattern was
headache, which showed the highest rates for 30-
to 59-year-olds, with lower rates for respondents
in their 20s and 60s, and the lowest rates
reported by people 70 years of age. Figure 1
graphs the trends for chronic localized and wide-
spread pain across 10-year age categories, strati-
fied by sex.
Discussion
We found that the overall population estimates for
nonminor current localized and widespread pain
of 3 months duration were low compared with
previous reports. This holds true in the interna-
tional comparison [7,14­16], with United States
surveys [2,33], and with reports from previous
NHANES investigations [27,28,34­36]. In spite
of the generally lower prevalence rates, the confi-
dence intervals around our estimates do not
explicitly rule out rates that correspond to the
range of values observed in these other studies.
The low rates detected in our analyses could be
explained by the method of data collection used by
the NHANES. For instance, in-person interviews
as opposed to mailed questionnaires [17­20], or
the wording of the questions, could result in lower
pain rates. Furthermore, the rates reported here
reflect estimates for current chronic pain. Other
studies typically did not require pain to be current
or even recent, and likely captured any lifetime
occurrence of chronic pain, resulting in higher
rates. Finally, the NHANES items focused on
nonminor pain. Previous epidemiological investi-
gations that inquired about pain intensity and dis-
ability found that only 8­30% of participants rated
their pain as nonminor [18,37­40].
We found that the associations with age were
nonlinear for almost all chronic pain conditions.
The prevalence for both localized and widespread
pain increased from younger to middle ages, then
leveled (localized pain) or decreased (widespread
pain) among older people. This pattern has been
previously reported for back pain, shoulder/arm
pain, headache, and chronic widespread pain
[9,20,31,33]. In contrast, other studies have
described an almost linear increase of pain preva-
lence with age [41,42]. Our analysis might not
reflect older adults who suffer from nonminor pain
and do not live in private homes, because the
NHANES is a household survey and does not
solicit information from institutionalized indi-
viduals or those in assisted living situations. Thus,
our results are not necessarily inconsistent with
the observation that pain increases with age.
Except for headaches, we did not observe mean-
ingful differences in the rates of pain between
women and men, even though some other differ-
ences were statistically significant. This pattern
corresponds to most previous studies, which have
observed a 2:1 female predominance for headache,
but not for back and chest pain [17,43­45].
Women also more often experienced abdominal
and facial pain, but these differences were less pro-
nounced, inconsistent, and not always significant.
Likewise, only one other study has detected sex
differences for all pain regions [46]. However,
our results did not reflect the striking female

Prevalence of Chronic Pain in the United States 807
predominance reported in virtually all previous
investigations of chronic widespread pain
[1,31,33,47­52]. Although we found that women
had significantly higher odds of chronic wide-
spread pain than men, the sex-related difference
was less than in other surveys. The reasons for this
are unclear, but the personal interview and focus
on nonminor pain may differentially influence the
reporting of pain in men and women.
Back pain is the most frequently cited region of
nonminor pain, affecting at least half of those who
report any localized pain [6,38]. This pattern was
evident in our analysis. Chronic pain in other loca-
tions typically occurs less frequently; however,
prevalence estimates are strongly dependent on
the criteria or definitions used [7,53,54], preclud-
ing direct comparisons of our rates to those
reported by others. Finally, although not entirely
comparable in terms of pain duration or severity,
data from previous NHANES cycles are notewor-
thy. The population prevalence of low back pain of
1 month duration in the 1976­1980 NHANES
was estimated at 10.3% [55], but in 1988­1994 the
rates had increased to 20% [56]. The 1-month pain
duration in these studies was less stringent than the
3 months required by the American College of
Rheumatology criteria, and is probably responsible
for the higher prevalence of pain in the earlier
NHANES cohorts compared with the 1999­2002
data. Pain of 1-month duration may not be chronic,
and our lower rates represent more accurate esti-
mates of current, nonminor, chronic pain.
One aspect of this study that deserves special
mention is our estimates for pain syndromes by
race/ethnicity. Mexican-Americans had lower
odds of reporting chronic pain in the limbs and
back than either black or non-Hispanic white
people. Black and non-Hispanic white people did
not have significantly different odds of reporting

any chronic pain outcome. In a comparable study,
a cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted
on a nationally representative probability sample
of non-Hispanic white subjects, non-Hispanic
black subjects, and Hispanic subjects of any race
to explore relationships between chronic pain and
race/ethnicity [36]. About 33% of each group
reported "frequent or persistent pain" for 3
months during the past year, but the pain experi-
ence and treatment preferences differed by race/
ethnicity. Others have observed differences in the
rates of pain in various regions between white,
black, and Mexican-American adults [2,2,36], and
international investigations have reported that
pain differs by race/ethnicity or cultural group.
For example, one study reported that the preva-
lence of back pain was lower among Mexicans and
New Zealanders than among Americans, Japanese,
Colombians, and Italians [57]. In contrast to our
findings, British researchers found that muscu-
loskeletal pain was more common among ethnic
minorities than among white people [25], and
white people more often experienced face/jaw pain
than black people, a finding we cannot address
as NHANES did not include an analogous pain
question. Lastly, another study in the United
States found that rates of headache, back pain and
pain in various other sites did not differ between
white and black people [58]. Taken together,
these studies underscore the need to incorporate
methods into survey research to better understand
the meaning of pain and the pain experience in
well-described, diverse, population-based samples.
This study has several limitations. First, our
results may not be directly comparable to previous
efforts, as estimates vary as a function of the inten-
sity, duration, episodic or recurrent nature of the
pain, and the number of body sites involved.
Regarding the latter, individuals with localized pain
may have had pain in >1 area, but did not meet
the American College of Rheumatology criteria
for widespread pain. A related issue is that the data
collected did not allow us to ascertain the intensity
or frequency of the pain or its impact on function.
Second, pain was assessed in the 1999­2002
NHANES by personal interview--a method not
often used in epidemiological studies of chronic
pain and thus may not be directly comparable to
data obtained from other study designs. Third,
because the NHANES did not perform physical
examinations or medical chart reviews, subjective
complaints could not be correlated with objective
findings. Fourth, some individuals with recurrent
chronic pain, such as migraine headaches, were
likely not detected by the definition of chronic pain
used in the NHANES. Fifth, some observations,
such as the lower rates of chronic pain among
Mexican-Americans, could not be attributed to a
single component cause or easily explained by the
data collected by the NHANES [59]. Sixth, smaller
ethnic groups were collapsed by the NHANES into
the category "Other," and we could not analyze
them separately. Nonetheless, our estimates of
clearly defined current, nonminor, chronic pain
were based on a large and representative American
sample and are likely to be among the most stable
estimates available for many of these conditions
overall, as well as by race/ethnicity.
In conclusion, this is a large national epidemio-
logical survey that encompasses diverse nonminor
chronic localized and widespread pain conditions
and includes adequate numbers of minority
respondents. Our findings suggest that the preva-
lence of chronic pain at various locations is lower
than previously reported. Over 85% of the popu-
lation did not report any current, nonminor,
chronic localized or widespread pain. Further-
more, in contrast to previous reports, we found
strikingly fewer sex differences, and with the pos-
sible exception of Mexican-Americans, generally
similar rates of chronic pain among racial/ethnic
groups. Future research should use more stringent
and carefully crafted pain assessments to facilitate
comparisons across pain severity, duration, and
body sites.
