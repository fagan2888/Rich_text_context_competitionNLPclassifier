ABSTRACT
In order to examine the potential involvement of ganglio-
sides in AD (Alzheimer's disease), we compared the gan-
glioside compositions of the brains of a double-transgenic
(Tg) mouse model [APP (amyloid precursor protein)/PSEN1
(presenilin)] of AD and a triple mutant mouse model with
an additional deletion of the GD3S (GD3-synthase) gene
(APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ). These animals were chosen since it
was previously reported that APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - triple-
mutant mice performed as well as WT (wild-type) con-
trol and GD3S- / - mice on a number of reference mem-
ory tasks. Cholinergic neuron-specific gangliosides, such
as GT1a and GQ1b, were elevated in the brains of
double-Tg mice (APP/PSEN1), as compared with those
of WT mice. Remarkably, in the triple mutant mouse brains
(APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ), the concentration of GT1a was el-
evated and as expected there was no expression of GQ1b.
On the other hand, the level of c-series gangliosides, includ-
ing GT3, was significantly reduced in the double-Tg mouse
brain as compared with the WT. Thus, the disruption of
the gene of a specific ganglioside-synthase, GD3S, altered the
expression of cholinergic neuron-specific gangliosides. Our

cholinergic-specific ganglioside, GT1a, in the triple mutant
mouse brains (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) may contribute to the
memory retention in these mice.

INTRODUCTION
Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing GSLs (glycosphin-
golipids) expressed primarily, but not exclusively, in the outer
leaflet of the plasma membrane of cells of all vertebrates
[gangliosides are abbreviated using the nomenclature rules
of IUPAC-IUB (1977) and according to Svennerholm (1963)].
Those GSLs are particularly abundant in the nervous sys-
tem. Ganglioside metabolism is closely associated with brain
development, and in some cases with the pathology of neu-
rodegenerative diseases such as AD (Alzheimer's disease). AD
is the most common type of dementia with clinical symp-
toms that include deficits in memory, judgment, thinking and

behaviour. The accumulation of As (amyloid -proteins) is
one of the major pathological hallmarks in AD. Although the
functions of gangliosides in the pathogenic mechanisms of
AD are not completely understood, evidence has accumu-
lated to indicate a critical role for gangliosides in binding
to and aggregation of As, the toxic peptides in AD brain.
Thus, gangliosides are frequently used as biomarkers associ-
ated with the pathological events of AD (Ariga et al., 2011;
Yanagisawa, 2011).
We recently examined the ganglioside composition of
the brains of a double-Tg (transgenic) mouse model [APP
(amyloid precursor protein)/PSEN1 (presenilin-1)] of AD that
co-expresses mouse/human chimeric APP with the Swedish
double-mutation and human PSEN1 with a deletion of exon
9 (Ariga et al., 2010). Although the accumulation of A was
confirmed in the double-Tg mouse brains and sera, the con-
tent and composition of the major ganglio-N-tetraosyl-series
gangliosides in the brains were not significantly different be-
tween the double-Tg mice and WT (wild-type) mice (Ariga
et al., 2010). This latter finding was in line with that re-
ported by Sawamura et al. (2000), who also did not detect
any changes in the major ganglioside patterns in the mu-
tant PSEN2 double-Tg mice as compared with those in WT
mice. The most interesting finding of our previous study was
the increased expression of the Chol-1 antigens, GT1a
and GQ1b, especially GQ1b, in the brains of double-Tg
(APP/PSEN1) mice as compared with those in WT mice.
A2B5 antigens, including the c-series gangliosides such as
GT3, GT1c and GQ1c, are well-known marker molecules of
glial precursor cells, O-2A progenitor cells, which differenti-
ate into type-2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Raff et al.,
1983; Zhang, 2001). GT3 was detected in the developing em-
bryonic mouse brains using A2B5 mAb (monoclonal antibody)
and the expression of GT3 was significantly diminished during
later development (Ngamukote et al., 2007).
In a previous study, we established the triple-Tg mouse
(APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) by cross-breeding the double-Tg
(APP/PSEN1) mouse model of AD with GD3S- / - mice
(Bernardo et al., 2009). GD3S (GD3-synthase) is responsi-
ble for the biosynthesis of GD3, a key intermediate for the
biosynthesis of b- and c-series gangliosides, including two of
the major brain gangliosides: GD1b and GT1b. Surprisingly,
A plaques and the associated neuropathology were almost
completely absent in the triple-Tg (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - )
mice, resulting in cognitive improvement. These triple-Tg
mice performed as well as WT controls on all behavioural
tests of sensorimotor function, anxiety and cognition. We
reasoned that there must be a correlation between the patho-
genesis of AD and the unique ganglioside composition in the
GD3S knockout animals. For this reason, we undertook a de-
tailed analysis of the minor gangliosides, particularly GT1a,
GQ1b and GT3, in the brain of the double-Tg and triple-Tg
mice and found that these minor gangliosides were signifi-
cantly altered. The elevated expression of GT1a in the triple-
Tg animals was particularly pronounced. Our data suggest
that the elevated cholinergic-specific ganglioside, GT1a, in
the triple-mutant mouse brains (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) may
contribute to diminished plaque formation and, concomi-
tantly, functional recovery in these mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gangliosides and antibodies
Chol-1 gangliosides, GQ1b and GT1b, were isolated from
bovine brains (Ando et al., 1992; Hirabayashi et al., 1992).
GD3 ganglioside was isolated from buttermilk (Ren et al.,
1992). A mouse mAb, A2B5, was originally derived from a
mouse immunized with 8-day chicken embryo retinas (Eisen-
barth et al., 1979); the hybridoma cells were obtained from
ATCC (Manassas). Mouse Chol-1 mAb (GGR-41) was ob-
tained by immunizing mice with a GQ1b-enriched gan-
glioside fraction extracted from bovine brain according to
conventional procedures (Kusunoki et al., 1993).
Animals
The double-Tg mouse model of AD (APPswe
+ PSEN1) was
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor; stock
#004462) and propagated in our laboratories. The mice
express the chimeric mouse/human APP gene harbouring
the Swedish double-mutation (K595N/M596L) and a human
PSEN1 gene with a deletion of exon 9. The triple-Tg
mouse model of AD (APPswe
+ PSEN1 lacking the gene
encoding GD3S (ST-II; ST8 -N-acetyl-neuraminide, -2,8-
sialyltransferase 1; St8sia1) was prepared as previously
described (Bernardo et al., 2009). All animals, both male
and female, used for ganglioside analysis were from 7
to 9 months of age. The use of animals for this study
was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees at the Georgia Regents University and University
of Tennessee Health Sciences Center.
Ganglioside isolation
Gangliosides were isolated from brain slices containing hip-
pocampal/cortical tissue from WT, GD3S- / - , double-Tg and
triple-Tg mice (n = 3 per group) as previously described (Yu
and Ledeen, 1972) with some modifications (Ariga et al.,
1988). Briefly, total lipids were extracted from brain tis-
sues with 5 volumes each of chloroform­methanol (1:2, 1:1
and 2:1, v/v) and chloroform­methanol­water (30:60:8, v/v;
Solvent A). Then, the combined extracts were evaporated
and dissolved in 5 ml of Solvent A, and applied to a DEAE-
Sephadex A-25 column (acetate form, 2-ml bed volume), fol-
lowed by elution with 20 ml of solvent A to remove the neu-
tral lipids. The acidic lipid fraction, containing gangliosides,
was then eluted with 20 ml of chloroform­methanol­0.8 M

by desalting using Sep-Pak Cartridge column chromatogra-
phy (Waters Assoc.) (Kubo and Hoshi, 1985). The lipid-bound
sialic acid [NeuNAc (N-acetylneuraminic acid or sialic acid)]
content in the acidic lipid fraction was determined by the
resorcinol­HCl reagent (Svennerholm, 1957). A portion of
the acidic lipid fraction, equivalent to 1.5 g of NeuNAc,
was applied to an HPTLC (high-performance thin-layer chro-
matography) plate and developed with the solvent system

After the plate was dipped in chloroform to remove excess
polymer, ganglioside bands were visualized by spraying with
the orcinol­sulfuric acid reagent at 100C.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
GD3-synthase (STII; GD3S) is responsible for catalysing the
biosynthesis of GD3, a key intermediate for the synthesis
of other b- and c-series gangliosides (Figure 1). In GD3S
gene knockout mice, all b-series gangliosides, including
GD3, GD2, GD1b, GT1b and GQ1b, are deleted, and a-series
gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a and GM2 show accretion
(Okada et al., 2002). Chol-1 gangliosides are normally
minor species in the brain and serve as unique markers of
cholinergic neurons (Ando et al., 1992; Hirabayashi et al.,
1992). They have also been shown immunocytochemically
in human central nervous system (Obrocki and Borroni,
1988; Whittaker et al., 1992) and may find applications
in human neuropathology. The expression of Chol-1
gangliosides in rat brain regions such as the hippocampus
is developmentally regulated, and their concentrations
increase with aging (Derrington and Borroni, 1990). Ando
et al. (2004) further showed that treatment of anti-Chol-1
mAb inhibited the release of acetylcholine from synapto-
somes. Interestingly, the memory and learning abilities of
rats given anti-Chol-1 mAb were remarkably suppressed.
On the contrary, treatment of Chol-1 gangliosides of
the synaptosomal preparation induced choline uptake and
enhanced acetylcholine synthesis. Thus, Chol-1 gangliosides
may participate in maintaining cognitive functions such
as memory and learning. In addition, Chol-1 gangliosides
were shown to alleviate the decreased synaptic functions of
aged brains (Ando et al., 1998). These findings suggest that
Chol-1 antigens may play an important role in cholinergic
synaptic transmission and participate in cognitive function.
In our current study, we confirmed the expression of Chol-1
antigens in GD3S- / - mice (Figure 2A, lane 2). As expected,
there was no expression of GQ1b in the brain of GD3S- / -
mice, but the levels of GT1a were significantly elevated
(Figure 2A, lane 2). In contrast, the concentrations of both
Chol-1 ganglioside, GQ1b and GT1a, were increased in
the brains of double-Tg mice as compared with those in the
brains of WT mice, as shown in Figure 3(B), lane 2 and 3(C).
The APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - triple-mutant mice lack b-
series gangliosides, which was compensated by a correspond-
ing increase in the a-series gangliosides, GM1 (63.8%) and
GD1a (50.8%), as compared with those of WT mice (Bernardo
et al., 2009). In the present study, we found that the triple-
mutant (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) mice expressed GT1a, but
not GQ1b; the lack of GQ1b was clearly because of the
deletion of the GD3S gene (Figure 3C). Remarkably, we found
that deletion of the gene encoding GD3S actually resulted in
a significant overexpression of GT1a ganglioside (Figures 2
and 3).
Another interesting aspect of the ganglioside composi-
tion in the brains of double-mutant (APP/PSEN1) and triple-
mutant (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) mice was the expression of
the c-series gangliosides. It is known that mouse mAb A2B5
recognizes the c-series gangliosides (GQ1c, GT1c, GT3, etc.)

GT1a in triple-Tg AD mouse brains
Figure 3 HPTLC analysis of ganglioside expression in the brains of double-mutant, triple-mutant and WT mice
Gangliosides were separated by HPTLC using the solvent system of chloroform/methanol/0.2% CaCl2
(50:45:10, v/v) and bands were
visualized by staining with the resorcinol-HCl reagent (A) or immunostaining with anti-Chol-1 mAb (GGR-41) (B). Each lane (1­3)
contained 3 g of lipid-bound sialic acid except lane 4. Lane 1, gangliosides of the brain of WT mice; lane 2, gangliosides of the
brain of double-mutant mice; lane 3, gangliosides of the brain of triple-mtant mice; 4, authentic GT1a (20 ng) and GQ1b (20 ng),
respectively. Please note that in lane 4, the amount of the two standards was too low to be revealed by the resorcinol-HCl reagent. (C)
The concentrations of GT1a and GQ1b, present in the total gangliosides in each sample, were estimated by densitometric analysis of
(B) (n = 3). In triple-Tg mice, the concentration of GT1a was significantly elevated compared with those in the WT and double-mutant
mice. No detectable amounts of GQ1b was present in the triple-mutant mouse brains.
(Bieberich et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2004). c-Series gangliosides
are normally present in very low abundance in adult
brain, but are robustly expressed in embryonic brain (Yu
et al., 2004); during brain maturation the biosynthesis
of gangliosides is switched from the c- to the a- and
b-series gangliosides (Yu et al., 2004). For this reason, A2B5
immunoreactivity has been widely used as an indicator of
immature neurons and glia. In contrast with the Chol-1
antigens, a c-series ganglioside, GT3, was significantly
reduced in double-mutant (APP/PSEN1) mouse brains as
compared with that in WT mouse brains (Figure 4). This
finding is different from previous immunohistochemical
results found in human AD brains (Takahashi et al., 1991;
Tooyama et al., 1992) in which A2B5-positive antigens were
found to be increased in AD brain. This discrepancy may be
owing to the specificity of the mAb A2B5, which has been
reported to cross-react with sulfatide in AD brains (Majocha
et al., 1989). It is possible that the immunoreactivity of the
mAb A2B5 used in their study could arise not only from
c-series ganglioside, but also from sulfatide, resulting in an
overestimation of the immunohistochemical intensity.
Recent advances on the disruption of genes encoding
glycosyltransferases for ganglioside biosynthesis have facil-
itated studies on the functional role of these glycolipids in

the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases (Yu
et al., 2012). In AD studies, Oikawa et al. (2009) established
Tg mice expressing human APP having Swedish and London
mutations with GM2-synthase knockout mice. The mutant
mice did not express GM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b, but ro-
bustly expressed GM3 and GD3, as reported by Takamiya et al.
(1996). The mutant mice also showed a significant increase
of A accumulation in vascular tissues and formation of a
severe dysphonic form of amyloid angiopathy in the brain.
Most recently, Wu et al. (2011) reported that in mutant mice
with a disrupted gene encoding GalNAcT, -synuclein ex-
pression was significantly elevated in the substantia nigra
pars compacta of the brains. These mice showed overt motor
disability on aging, loss of dopaminergic neurons and aggre-
gation of -synuclein, resulting in Parkinson-like symptoms.
On the other hand, Okada et al. (2002) established a GD3S
gene knockout mouse in which all b-series gangiosides were
deleted. Interestingly, these mice showed no morphologi-
cal changes in the brains and apparent abnormal behaviour.
Moreover, no differences in Fas-mediated apoptotic reac-
tion in lymphocytes compared with the WT mice were found.
However, the mutant mice exhibited reduced regeneration
of axotomized hypoglossal nerves compared with the WT
mice, suggesting that b-series gangliosides are more impor-
tant in the repair of damaged nerves than in the differ-
entiation of the nervous system. In our previous study, we
(Bernardo et al., 2009) established the triple-mutant mouse
model of AD (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) in which all b-series
gangliosides, including GD3, were absent, but GM1 and GD1a
were significantly increased. Interestingly, A plaques and the

associated neuropathology were almost completely absent
in the triple-mutant mice, which showed no impairment of
cognitive functions. These observations suggest that b-series
gangliosides derived from the action of GD3S are one of the
major causes of A accumulation and AD. Analysis of these
triple-mutant mice may contribute to our understanding of
the neurobiological and behavioural characteristics of A-
ganglioside interaction as an essential step toward eluci-
dating the early pathological events in AD. Thus, inhibition
of GD3S may be a useful therapeutic target to restore the
cognitive deficits, amyloid plaque formation, and neurode-
generation observed in AD (Bernardo et al., 2009). Several in-
vestigators have described aberrant ganglioside metabolism
may be participated in the pathogenesis in AD (for review, see
Ariga et al., 2011). In this regard, it is interesting to note that
chronic infusion of GM1 into the lateral ventricle of patients
with AD for 1 year resulted in remarkable improvement of
their memory function (Svennerholm et al., 2002). The un-
derlying mechanism of the GM1-induced effect is a sub-
ject of considerable speculation. Nonetheless, an increased
level of GM1 in the triple mutant mice is consistent with the
above observation and may also contribute to the observed
improved cognitive improvement in these mice.
In conclusion, Chol-1 antigens and A2B5-positive c-
series gangliosides are normally found as minor components
in mouse brains and their expression is developmentally reg-
ulated (Ngamukote et al., 2007). At present, the functional
role of those gangliosides, especially Chol-1, in the patho-
genesis of AD is still unknown. Our current findings that those
gangliosides are overexpressed in the triple Tg model of AD,
which also exhibits improved memory function and no amy-
loid formation, could provide some important directions for
future research.
