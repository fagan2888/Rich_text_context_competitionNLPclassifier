Related Dementias, Disability, and Comorbidities on
Cost of Care for Elderly Persons

Objectives. Our primary objectives were (a) to determine the relative impact of Alzheimer's disease and related de-
mentias (ADRD), disability, and common comorbid health conditions on the cost of caring for community-dwelling el-
derly person and (b) to determine whether ADRD serves as an effect modifier for the effect of disability and common
comorbidities on costs.
Methods. Participants were drawn from community respondents to the 1994 National Long Term Care Survey. The
authors compared total cost of caring for persons without ADRD with that of those who had moderate and severe
ADRD. Using regression analysis, the author identified the adjusted effect of ADRD, limitations in activities of daily
living (ADLs), and common comorbidities on total costs.
Results. Persons with severe ADRD had higher median total costs ($10,234) than did persons with moderate ADRD
($4,318) and those without ADRD ($2,268, p  .001). However, disability measured by ADL limitations was a more
important predictor of total cost than was ADRD status in both stratified and multivariate analyses. Comorbidities such
as heart attack, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also increased costs. Severe ADRD was an effect
modifier for ADL limitations, increasing the positive impact of disability on total costs among persons with severe
ADRD, but not for comorbidities.
Discussion. Disability, severe ADRD, and comorbidity all had independent effects that increased total costs. Thus,
any risk adjustment procedure should account for disability and comorbidity and not just ADRD status.
LZHEIMER'S disease and related dementias (ADRD)
has been estimated to be the third most expensive dis-
ease to treat in the United States; causes substantial disabil-
ity to afflicted persons; and has a major impact on family
members, who often provide a substantial amount of infor-
mal care (Ernst & Hay, 1994; Meek, McKeithan, & Schu-
mock, 1998; Small et al., 1997). The cost of ADRD in-
cludes the cost of formal personal health services provided
in a variety of settings--nursing homes, hospitals, physi-
cians' offices, and in homes--as well as informal care pro-
vided by families and paid caregivers (Coughlin & Liu,
1989; Ernst & Hay, 1994; Hay & Ernst, 1987; Hu, Huang,
& Cartwright, 1986; Huang, Cartwright, & Hu, 1988; Max,
1993; Meek et al., 1998; Ostbye & Crosse, 1994; Rice et
al., 1993; Stommel, Collins, & Given, 1994; Weinberger et al.,
1994). Prescription drugs and assistive devices such as du-
rable medical equipment are also factors. Intangible costs
such as reductions in quality of life or reduced life expect-
ancy are difficult to measure. The effect of ADRD on the cost
of caring for elderly persons is important because of the in-
creasing numbers of persons diagnosed with ADRD in the
United States (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1997).
Estimates of the prevalence of ADRD vary from 2.7% to
11.2% of the population aged 65 and older across U.S. stud-
ies (Bachman et al., 1993; Beard, Offord, & Kurland, 1991;
Evans et al., 1990; R. I. Pfeiffer, Afifi, & Chance, 1987),
and a recent U.S. General Accounting Office (1997) meta-
analysis placed the figure at 5.7% of the population aged 65
and older. Study populations and methods of diagnosis dif-
fered across studies, contributing to the uncertainty, but the
prevalence of dementia has even been found to differ within
the same study population when multiple diagnostic criteria
are used (Erkinjunti et al., 1997). However, there is consen-
sus that ADRD prevalence rises with age, making it of great
concern as the population of the United States continues to
age (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1997).
Ernst and Hay (1997) reviewed the literature on the cost
of ADRD and found that estimates varied by a factor of 4
across studies. They pointed out that drawing conclusive
cost estimates from the existing literature is made difficult
by the localized nature of many samples, differences in con-
trols for severity of ADRD, lack of control for other impor-
tant patient characteristics, and uncertainty regarding the
period of data collection in some studies. The clearest find-
ings from the cost literature are as follows: (a) Caregiver
time is a large portion of the cost of caring for persons
with ADRD in community settings; (b) costs rise with in-
creased dementia and limitations in activities of daily living
(ADLs); and (c) the cost and distribution of cost among for-
mal and informal care categories varies according to resi-
dential location. Demented individuals living in nursing
homes tend to receive more paid caregiving and to incur
A

higher total costs, whereas those living in community set-
tings tend to cost less overall but receive a larger proportion
of their care from informal, unpaid caregivers.
Recently, Leon, Cheng, and Neumann (1998) found that
monthly total costs (formal and caregiving services) of car-
ing for a person with ADRD were lower for community res-
idents and that increased disability was an important predic-
tor of higher cost, in a sample that included persons from
several states. Five studies have focused on the cost to the
Medicare program of caring for persons with ADRD by
studying Medicare claims records (Cano, Hennessey, War-
ren, & Lubitz, 1997; Gutterman, Markowitz, Lewis, & Fil-
lit, 1999; Newcomer, Clay, Luxenberg, & Miller, 1999;
Taylor & Sloan, 2000; Weiner, Powe, Weller, Shaffer, &
Anderson, 1998). These studies showed that persons with
ADRD use more Medicare-financed care compared with
controls without the disease and suggested that prior re-
search based on localized samples that did not have admin-
istrative claims data probably underestimated the magnitude
of such care. Comparison of these studies is also made diffi-
cult because of different controls used across studies, and
there is still much that is unclear about cost of care and
ADRD. Ernst and Hay (1997) pointed out in their review of
the literature that "despite the studies that have been done,
there is clearly room for new work on AD costs, ideally
with national instead of small and geographically limited
samples" (p. 139).
Our study was designed to provide more information on
the total cost of caring for elderly persons living in commu-
nity settings, including the distribution of cost among differ-
ent types of care, by using a national sample that included
persons over the age of 65 who lived in the community. Per-
sons living in nursing homes were excluded from our analy-
sis because the major cost driver of such persons' care is be-
ing in a nursing home per se, and not the mixture of
disabilities and/or diseases that they have. There were two
main goals of our study: (a) to determine the relative impact
of ADRD, disability as measured by ADL limitations, and
comorbidities on the total cost of caring for elderly persons
living in the community, and (b) to determine whether the
presence of ADRD serves as an effect modifier of the rela-
tionship between disability and comorbidity on total costs.
These analyses are relevant to current policy discussions re-
garding the incremental burden on society of a rise in the
prevalence of ADRD and help answer questions regarding
whether ADRD per se or comorbidity and disability are bet-
ter variables that might be used as risk adjustors for policy
purposes.
METHODS
Sample
Our sample consisted of 4,834 respondents to the com-
munity portion of the 1994 National Long Term Care Sur-
vey (NLTCS), all of whom were aged 65 and older. A total
of 1,742 were continuing respondents, meaning they re-
sponded to the 1989 NLTCS. A further 2,193 persons were
newly screened into the sample in 1994, meaning they were
aged 65 years and reported at least one limitation in an ADL
or instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) that had
lasted or was expected to last for at least 90 days at a
screener interview, and subsequently completed a full com-
munity interview. Another 894 respondents were given a
complete community interview even though they did not re-
port any limitations in IADLs or ADLs on a screener inter-
view; this group was included to allow for analyses that in-
cluded "successful agers." Multivariate analysis samples
were reduced slightly by item nonresponse of some vari-
ables.
Method of Diagnosing ADRD
We defined persons as having ADRD if they had low
cognition as measured by the Short Portable Mental Status
Questionnaire (SPMSQ; Pfeiffer, 1975). The SPMSQ "is
intended to offer a rapid screen for cognitive deficit in the
community-dwelling elderly" (Fillenbaum, 1988, p. 120).
Researchers have used a variety of cutoff points with the
SPMSQ to define persons with impaired cognition, and we
used a variant of what was suggested by Fillenbaum without
defining different standards for persons of different races or
educational levels because of a relatively homogenous
study sample in terms of race and because of incomplete
data for education. We placed all respondents into three
groups on the basis of their answers to the SPMSQ. Persons
who got zero to three items correct on the SPMSQ were
classified as having severe ADRD. Those who got four to
six items correct were classified as having moderate ADRD,
and those who had seven or more items correct were classi-
fied as not having ADRD. Persons who responded via a
proxy were assigned to the severe ADRD group if the rea-
son for a proxy response was noted as being due to cogni-
tive limitations; when a proxy was due to other reasons, the
person was assigned to the "none" category. Descriptive
analyses were stratified by this variable, and ADRD status
was controlled for in multivariate models directly as well as
interacted with ADL limitations and the presence of four se-
rious health conditions.
Defining the Cost of ADRD
We took a broad perspective of cost and included costs
that were paid for by the Medicare program, costs paid out
of pocket by families for items such as caregiving and pre-
scription drugs, and costs that were not reimbursed such as
caregiving provided by family members. Intangible costs
such as pain and suffering associated with disability were
not measured in this study, but we did quantify levels of dis-
ability to provide context for cost figures. The period for
which we measured costs was the 365 days prior to the 1994
NLTCS interview. For Medicare-financed costs we identi-
fied the services that were provided to an individual for the
365 days prior to the 1994 NLTCS according to Medicare
claims. For other cost items, we annualized costs that were
measured in terms of utilization in the month or week prior
to the 1994 interview. For example, respondents reported
the number of hours of assistance for ADL limitations that
they received in the week prior to the 1994 NLTCS. We
multiplied this figure by 52 to obtain an estimate of the
number of hours of ADL assistance that a respondent re-
ceived in the year prior to the 1994 NLTCS, which we then
multiplied by an hourly wage rate.
COST OF ADRD AND DISABILITY S287
Nursing home costs.--Given that a person answered the
1994 community NLTCS survey, it was rare that they re-
ported having been in a nursing home in the previous 365
days. Only 3 persons reported having spent time in a nurs-
ing home in the year prior to the 1994 NLTCS. For this rea-
son, we did not include nursing home costs in our total costs
estimates based on self-reports. Our Medicare costs noted
previously did include Medicare-financed stays in skilled
nursing facilities.
ADL helper cost.--For community respondents, we
used the self-reported number of hours of ADL help an indi-
vidual reported receiving for the week prior to the 1994
NLTCS. We multiplied this by 52 to devise an annual esti-
mate of hours of ADL help received. We then multiplied
these hours by the $6.95/hr figure used by Leon and col-
leagues (1998) to estimate the cost of caregiving for persons
with ADRD. When the number of hours of ADL support
was missing, we assigned zero ADL help hours if the per-
sons had no ADL limitations, because in such a case they
had missing ADL help hours because of the skip pattern of
the database. If they had at least one ADL limitation, we im-
puted the ADL help hours received if they had a missing
value for this item as follows. For respondents with valid re-
sponses for ADL hours, we estimated a median regression
model with number of ADL hours in the previous week as
the dependent variable. The explanatory variables used
were number of ADL limitations, male gender, and married.
Using the coefficients obtained from estimating this model
on persons with valid responses, we then predicted the value
for number of ADL hours in the previous week for persons
with missing ADL hours. The predicted values ranged from
2 hr/week to 13.5 hr/week. We then multiplied the predicted
hours for persons with missing values by 52 to develop an
estimate of the number of ADL support hours received in
the year prior to the 1994 NLTCS. A total of 1,117 persons
had their ADL hours of help imputed in this manner.
Assuming that the ADL hours from the week prior to the
survey held constant for the entire 365-day period may have
resulted in an overestimation of the mean and median ADL
helper cost and, therefore, the total annual cost of ADRD.
We chose this approach over projecting forward (e.g., as-
suming costs in the week prior to the survey held constant
for the 365 days after the interview) because it ensured that
we measured costs for the same period of time for each per-
son, whereas going forward would have meant differential
cost follow-up periods because of mortality. In multivariate
analyses, the assumption we made had no effect in deter-
mining the relative importance of explanatory variables in
explaining total cost, because the annualization approach
we used simply multiplied a weekly cost by a constant for
each person.
To provide information regarding the sensitivity of our
findings to these imputation methods, our data show results
when all cases (including those with imputed ADL hours)
were used and when only cases in which no imputation was
necessary were used. The overall multivariate results were
robust and did not differ when cases with imputed ADL
helper hours were used.
Medicare cost.--The amount actually paid by Medicare
for all services provided by Medicare for the 365 days prior
to the 1994 interview date was measured for all respon-
dents.
IADL helper cost.--The approach was identical to that
used for ADL helper cost, including the imputation of miss-
ing values for IADL helper hours among persons with some
limitations after those with no IADL limitations had their
IADL helper hours set to zero. We multiplied the number of
hours reported for the week prior to the 1994 interview by
52 to get annual hours. The hourly price of $6.08 for IADL
helper hours was used following Leon and colleagues
(1998). Some 331 persons had their IADL hours of help im-
puted on the basis of their reported limitations in IADLs
with the same regression model approach that was used
for missing ADL hours and the same explanatory model.
The predicted hours of IADL support ranged from 4 to 25
hr/week.
Prescription costs.--Respondents were asked how many
prescription drugs they had taken during the past month. We
multiplied this number by 12 to obtain the annual number of
prescription medications being taken. We used the average
cost per prescription medication used by Ostbye and Crosse
(1994) to obtain annual prescription drug costs.
Controlling for Disability and Comorbidity
A distinction should be made between the cost of caring
for a person with a particular condition, such as ADRD, and
the incremental cost that a condition such as ADRD adds
to the total cost of caring for an individual above and beyond
the otherwise expected cost. We wanted to identify any ad-
ditional cost associated with having ADRD after accounting
for disability and comorbidities. If comorbidity and disabil-
ity are not separately accounted for, then it is likely that the
cost effect of ADRD will be biased. Therefore, we con-
trolled for these factors in our multivariate models in addi-
tion to a limited number of demographic variables.
Disability.--Disability was measured by the number of
limitations in the following six ADLs: dressing, bathing,
eating, getting in and out of bed, moving around inside the
home, and using the toilet. A limitation meant that a person
either needed help doing the activity or used equipment to
help them do the activity. We used number of ADL limita-
tions to stratify the sample for descriptive purposes and in-
cluded number of ADL limitations as a linear control vari-
able, on the basis of descriptive findings that hours of help
and overall cost rise with increasing number of ADL limita-
tions. We also used the number of limitations in IADLs and
behavioral problems, such as getting lost, forgetting to do
important things, and losing one's temper frequently, to
characterize the sample and illustrate differences among the
three ADRD groups (severe, moderate, and none). We did
not control for limitations in IADLs in multivariate models
because of their high degree of collinearity with limitations
in ADL.

Comorbiditiy.--The presence of certain diseases has
been found in past work to be important in explaining varia-
tions in costs of health care generally (Bass, Looman, &
Ehrlich, 1992; Ellis, Pope, & Iezzoni, 1996; Gruenberg, Ka-
ganova, & Hornbrook, 1996), and costs for caring for per-
sons with ADRD specifically (Gutterman et al., 1999). We
used self-reported information from the 1994 NLTCS on
the presence of four common conditions both to control for
severity of illness and to investigate whether having ADRD
altered the total costs of caring for an individual with a par-
ticular condition given the presence of ADRD. The pres-
ence of the following four conditions was measured at the
1994 NLTCS: heart attack, cerebrovascular event/stroke,
cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
For heart attack and stroke, the survey asked whether either
had occurred during the past year, so a person answering yes
experienced this adverse health event during the period for
which we measured total costs. For cancer and COPD, the
survey asked whether these chronic conditions were present
at the time of the survey, so the onset of the disease was not
clear if they reported that they had the condition. We in-
cluded binary variables equal to 1 if a respondent self-reported
a condition, zero otherwise. We controlled for these four
conditions separately as well as interacted them with se-
vere ADRD to determine whether the presence of severe
ADRD altered the total cost of caring for a person with one
of these diseases compared with the costs of caring for a
nondemented person with one of these conditions.
Analytical Methods
For much of our analysis, we compared persons across
the three ADRD groups (severe, moderate, and none), either
in terms of disability or cost, then estimated multivariate
models to more fully adjust for multiple predictors of total
cost. For the descriptive statistical analyses, we compared
the median total cost of care stratified by the three ADRD
categories and the number of limitations in ADL, catego-
rized as follows: no limitations, one or two limitations, three
or four limitations, and five or six limitations. We compared
the median values of the total cost variable because of the
right-skewness of the total cost of care. To determine
whether there were any significant differences between the
median annual cost of care among the severe, moderate, and
no ADRD groups, we conducted a nonparametric signifi-
cance test of the null hypothesis that the sample medians in
all three groups were equal (severe  moderate  none),
with the probability of equality calculated using Fisher's ex-
act test and operationalized in Stata version 7.0 (StataCorp,
2001).
For the multivariate models, we used median regression
with bootstrapped standard errors (Chernick, 1999; Efron &
Tibshirani, 1993; Gould, 1992; StataCorp, 2001). As previ-
ously mentioned, the total cost of care variable displayed a
right-skewed distribution, and for that reason we chose to
focus our analyses on the median. In comparison with ordi-
nary least squares (OLS), median regression analyzes varia-
tion in the median of the dependent variable over the inde-
pendent variables (rather than variation in the mean) and
median regression fits a regression surface that minimizes
the sum of the absolute residuals (rather than minimizing
the sums of squares of the residuals). We calculated stan-
dard errors via the bootstrap method (with 3,000 replica-
tions) to minimize the effects of heteroskedasticity (Gould,
1992; Rogers, 1992). Although we present only the results
of the median regression analyses, we also estimated a stan-
dard OLS model with bootstrapped standard errors and ro-
bust regression that downweights the importance of outliers.
The substantive results of the median regression did not dif-
fer from the results of these alternative models.
RESULTS
Prevalence and Disability
Prevalence of severe ADRD was 22.2% (n  1,074),
with 322 persons (6.7%) having moderate ADRD. Persons
with severe ADRD were generally more disabled than were
persons with moderate or no ADRD (Table 1). Persons with
severe ADRD were older (81.4 years vs. 77.0 years, p 
.001) and had more limitations in ADLs than did persons
with the highest level of cognitive awareness (2.5 limita-
tions vs. 1.2 for persons with the highest cognition, p 
.001). They also had more limitations in IADLs and re-
ceived more hours of caregiving support for both ADL and
IADL support. Persons who had complete data for hours of
ADL and IADL support reported more hours compared
with those whose hours of support had to be imputed.
Therefore, our imputation method, although it produced a
similar distribution of responses, may have underestimated
hours of caregiving support used. Further, although the
mean number of hours of caregiving for ADL help was at
least doubled among the severe ADRD group relative to the
moderate and no ADRD groups, the percentage of the sam-
ple receiving at least some ADL help hours was more simi-
lar, suggesting that some severely demented community-
dwelling persons may not have received needed services.
Several behavioral items related to ADRD were more
common among those classified as having severe ADRD,
lending credence to our classification scheme. Persons with
severe dementia were more likely to report sometimes get-
ting lost (7.2% vs. 1.3% for those with best cognition, p 
.001), forgetting things (22.1% vs. 11.3%, p  .001), and
sometimes losing their temper or having an outburst (14.2%
vs. 8.1%, p .001). Although the percentage of respondents
answering affirmatively to these behavioral questions was
never more than one fifth of the population even among the
severe ADRD group, the pattern observed was consistent
with what would be expected if the ADRD classification re-
liably measured dementia, namely that those with severe
ADRD were much more likely than controls to report symp-
toms. However, the low overall rate of reporting suggests
systematic underreporting, in part due to missing values that
we did not try to impute for these variables; missing cases
were noted as not having the problem in question.
Persons with severe ADRD had median annual total costs
that were nearly 10 times as high as those for persons who
did not have ADRD ($10,234 for severe, $4,318 for moder-
ate, and $2,268 for none, p  .001, Table 2). Mean costs
showed a similar pattern whereby mean total costs were
higher among the severe ADRD group compared with the
none group, with costs for the moderate ADRD group in be-
COST OF ADRD AND DISABILITY S289
tween. Item-specific costs were greater for persons with se-
vere ADRD compared with those without ADRD for all
cost items except prescription drugs. Thus, the level of costs
among groups differed more than did the relative contribu-
tion of cost items to total costs.
Caregiving costs for both ADL and IADL limitations
were the largest contributors to total costs across the ADRD
groups, with care financed by Medicare generally the next
largest component of total costs. The median cost of ADL
help was higher when we considered only persons with no
missing information compared with median costs calculated on
the entire sample ($5,849 vs. $5,102 within severe ADRD).
Comparing the median and mean item-specific costs within the
moderate and no ADRD strata illustrated the skewed nature
of the cost variables; for example, the median Medicare cost
for persons with no ADRD was $0, whereas the mean was
$2,606.
Disability, Comorbidities, and Cost
There was a hierarchical ordering on total cost by the
number of limitations in ADLs, classified into four groups
and stratified by ADRD status. The number of limitations in
ADLs had a stronger effect on total costs than did ADRD
status. Within a given ADRD stratum, the median total
costs were more than 10 times greater for persons with five
or six limitations in ADLs relative to persons with no ADL
limitations (Table 3). However, total costs always varied by
a factor of 5 or less when we compared severe versus no
ADRD within a given ADL limitation strata. For example,
median costs were $552 for the nondemented group versus
$2,634 for those with severe ADRD within the strata of per-
sons who had no ADL limitations. The same comparison of
no ADRD (median costs $16,486) versus severe ADRD
($28,302) among persons with five or six limitations in
ADLs showed a similar relationship.
The presence of a serious health condition had an impact
on the total cost of caring for an individual, but the effect
was neither as great nor as clear as that between ADL limi-
tations and cost (Table 4). The median total cost of caring
for a person with any of the four major health conditions
highlighted (cancer, stroke, COPD, and heart attack) was 3Â­4
times higher when that person had severe ADRD com-
pared with no ADRD. For example, among the 223 persons
who experienced a stroke during the previous year, median
costs for those who also had severe ADRD were $17,197,
compared with $7,056 for those with moderate ADRD and
$6,660 for those without ADRD (p  .001). A similar rela-
tionship was shown among persons with more than one of
these chronic conditions as well as for persons with none of
them, the latter group having the lowest median total costs
in each ADRD strata (severe, $8,852; moderate, $3,991;
none, $1,806, p  .001).
Determinants of Adjusted Cost
Increased disability, comorbid health conditions, and se-
vere ADRD were all important determinants that increased
total annual costs. Each additional limitation in an ADL in-
creased costs by $2,210 (p  .001). Persons with severe
ADRD had costs that were $1,175 (p  .001) higher than
those of persons with good cognition. However, the costs of
those with moderate ADRD did not differ from those with
good cognition. When an individual experienced a heart at-
tack or stroke in the year prior to the 1994 NLTCS, or if
they reported a chronic lung disease at the 1994 survey,
their costs were significantly higher compared with persons
without these ailments. The magnitude of the effect on costs
differed among the four conditions, with a recent heart at-
tack increasing costs by $2,945 (p  .003), stroke by $1,680
(p  .02), and the presence of COPD by $459 (p  .04).

aADRD status was defined by the number of items a person got correct on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. Severe ADRD was zero to three items
correct and moderate was four to six items correct; persons getting at least seven items correct were classified as not having ADRD. Cells represent the mean value for
each variable, stratified by ADRD status.

NLTCS had higher costs ($356, p  .26), but the difference
did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance.
The lack of effect of prevalent cancer on costs is probably
due to the heterogeneity of the precise conditions and stage
that respondents had. Age and race had small effects on to-
tal cost.
Severe ADRD not only had a direct effect on total costs,
but also served as an effect modifier for the impact of dis-
ability, but not for comorbid health conditions, on cost (Ta-
ble 5). The interaction of severe ADRD and the number of
ADL limitations showed an increase in total cost of $2,180
(p  .001) for each limitation in an ADL experienced by a per-
son who was severely demented. None of the interactions
between comorbidities and severe ADRD were significant.
Thus, for these conditions severe ADRD did not serve as an
effect modifier of cost.
DISCUSSION
In some past work on the cost of ADRD, researchers have
measured the cost of caring for persons with ADRD, but not
the cost of ADRD per se. Our approach was an attempt to
avoid misattributing cost increases to ADRD and to tease
out other key determinants of cost. It is difficult for us to di-
rectly compare our results with other work because the stud-
ies in question differ in many respects, most notably in
how ADRD was identified, the samples used (particularly
whether they included community and nursing home resi-
dents), and the types of costs measured (Coughlin & Liu,
1989; Ernst & Hay, 1994; Hu et al., 1986; Huang et al.,
1988; Max, 1993; Ostbye & Crosse, 1994; Rice et al., 1993;
Stommel et al., 1994; Weinberger et al., 1994). Because the
sample we used oversampled disabled elderly persons, our
primary contribution is not calculation of per capita costs by

aADRD status was defined by the number of items a person got correct on
the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. Severe ADRD was zero to three
items correct and moderate was four to six items correct; persons getting at least
seven items correct were classified as not having ADRD.
bMedicare-financed care included physician care financed by Part B pay-
ments, durable medical equipment, hospital care, outpatient institutional care,
home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and hospice care.
cCells represent median cost of care (in 1994$) received in the 365 days prior
to the 1994 NLTCS. A nonparametric significance test of the null hypothesis
that the sample median in all three groups are equal (severe  moderate  none)
was performed; significance calculated with Fisher's exact test.
dCells represent mean cost of care (in 1994$) received in the 365 days prior

COST OF ADRD AND DISABILITY S291
ADRD status, but identification of the relative impact on
cost of ADRD, disability, and comorbidity. Further, we
show that the presence of ADRD serves as an effect modi-
fier for limitations in ADLs, a finding worthy of more
study.
Disability is a more powerful predictor of total costs than
is ADRD severity in both descriptive and multivariate anal-
yses. It is likely that ADRD is related to level of ADL limi-
tations, but our study cannot shed light on any causative link
between severe ADRD and disability because of our cross-
sectional measurement of these two variables. Not surpris-
ingly, both recently occurring comorbid conditions (heart
attack and stroke occurring within the past year) and COPD
prevalent on the interview date increase total annual costs
among persons who have no or moderate ADRD. We esti-
mated the effect of these conditions on cost because they are
common causes of morbidity and mortality, and as the pop-
ulation continues to age, their effect on costs both individu-
ally as well as in conjunction with ADRD will be important
determinants of the overall cost of caring for community-
dwelling elderly persons.
We tested whether severe ADRD serves as an effect
modifier of the relationship between four common health
conditions and cost. Some past work has shown that persons
with ADRD receive less Medicare-financed health care
compared with others with similar conditions, raising the
possibility that demented individuals receive less intensive
formal health services as a result of their mental status (Tay-
lor & Sloan, 2000). We do not find that this is the case, us-
ing a broader definition of costs.
Our study replicates in a national sample what has previ-
ously been found in local samples regarding composition of
costs for persons with ADRD: Medicare-financed health
care services do not compose the majority of total costs of
caring for community-dwelling elderly persons: Caregiving
services do. Although the magnitude of such costs differs by
ADRD status, the relative composition of cost items is
roughly the same. We find this to be true in spite of two fac-
tors that both work in the opposite direction. First, we used
fairly conservative hourly price estimates for caregiving
hours taken from other studies because the self-reported in-
formation on whether care was paid for or not, and if yes,
how much, is too incomplete to be reliable. The magnitude
of the average cost estimate per person by ADRD status is
sensitive to the hourly price used, but the multivariate work
identifying the relative importance of individual character-
istics on costs is not. Second, we have fairly precise mea-
surement of payment by Medicare for formal health ser-
vices because we used Medicare claims data. Other studies,
such as that of Hu and colleagues (1986), for example, did
not use such data. The use of Medicare claims plausibly re-
sults in a more precise estimate of cost of acute services
compared with estimates of such costs based on self-report,
but any undercounting of such costs by self-reports in past
studies was not sufficient to make such care a larger propor-
tion of total costs relative to informal care in our study.
Several limitations of our study should be noted. First, we
studied the costs of ADRD only among community-dwell-
ing persons aged 65 and older. Approximately 10Â­15% of
persons with ADRD are aged less than 65. Such persons

were not included in our sample. It is likely that cost differ-
entials between persons with and without ADRD would be
even larger for persons aged less than 65 because the age
impact on morbidity strengthens with age. Second, the
screening procedure used in the NLTCS resulted in a more
disabled sample compared to the entire population aged 65
and older making our per capita cost estimates in particular
likely overestimates. However, our models included more
than 1,700 community respondents who did not report a
limitation in an ADL in the 1994 NLTCS. Thus, we had a
substantial amount of variation in terms of disability in the
community sample. Having more healthy elderly persons in
our sample would likely serve to increase cost differences
between persons with ADRD and the no ADRD group and
would likely increase the relative impact of ADRD, disabil-
ity, and comorbidities on cost. Third, our cost estimates did
not account for the burden on caregivers in terms of physi-
cal and emotional strain, delay of care seeking, and reduced
employment, among other hardships involved in providing
care to demented individuals (Gwyther, 1998; Jones & Pe-
ters, 1992). Such costs are real, but they are very subjective
from the standpoint of monetizing them. Fourth, our cost
accounting approach ensured that each person had costs
measured for 1 year exactly, which is good but introduces a
survivor bias to the sample because costs just before death
are generally elevated, likely causing overestimates of the
point estimates of median annual cost of care. The annual-
ization procedure we used should not bias the multivariate
findings, because multiplying a weekly cost by 52 simply
introduces a constant to the dependent variable for each
case in the study. Finally, we were not able to assess costs in
institutions such as nursing homes in a similar manner to al-
low us to identify the effect of residential location on costs,
or to see what factors may predict cost variation within
nursing home.
Further work is needed that compares the adjusted cost of
caring for persons in community settings, traditional nurs-
ing homes, and other residential long-term care settings that
are specifically designed to care for persons with ADRD.
Work that analyzes the cost of caring for a person and also
considers any treatment benefits and/or benefits to care-
givers would be of the most use for families who must make
treatment decisions as well as for clinicians and policymak-
ers who are trying to hold down costs while maintaining an
appropriate level of care for persons with ADRD.
