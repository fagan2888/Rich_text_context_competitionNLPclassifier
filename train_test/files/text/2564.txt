Abstract
Background: Contextual factors, such as exposure to stressors, may be antecedents to IPV perpetration. These
contextual factors may be amenable to modification through intervention and prevention. However, few studies
have examined specific contextual factors. To begin to address this gap, we examined the associations between
financial stressors and three types of physical IPV perpetration.
Methods: This analysis used data from Wave IV of The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health.
We used logistic regression to examine the associations of financial stressors and each type of IPV (minor, severe,
causing injury), and multinomial logit regression to examine the associations of financial stressors and patterns of
co-occurring types of IPV perpetration (only minor; only severe; minor and severe; minor, severe, and causing injury;
compared with no perpetration).
Results: Fewer men perpetrated threats/minor physical IPV (6.7 %) or severe physical IPV (3.4 %) compared with
women (11.4 % and 8.8 %, respectively). However, among physical IPV perpetrators, a higher percentage of men
(32.0 %) than women (21.0 %) reported their partner was injured as a result of the IPV. In logistic regression models
of each type of IPV perpetration, both the number of stressors experienced and several types of financial stressors
were associated with perpetrating each type of IPV. Utilities nonpayment, housing nonpayment, food insecurity,
and no phone service were associated with increased odds of perpetrating each form of IPV in adjusted analysis.
Eviction was associated with perpetrating severe physical IPV but not threats/minor IPV or IPV causing injury. In
multinomial logit regression comparing patterns of IPV perpetration to perpetrating no physical IPV, the relationships
of financial stressors were less consistent. Food insecurity was associated with perpetrating only minor physical IPV.
Comparatively, overall number of financial stressors and four types of financial stressors (utilities nonpayment,
housing nonpayment, food insecurity, and disconnected phone service) were associated with perpetrating all three
forms of physical IPV.
Conclusions: Combined with prior research, our results suggested interventions to improve financial well-being may
be a novel way to reduce physical IPV perpetration.

Background
Intimate partner violence (IPV), defined as psycho-
logical, physical, or sexual violence within the context of
a current or former romantic relationship, is a significant
threat to the health and well-being of the United States
population (Coker et al. 2002). Up to a third of women
and a quarter of men report experiencing physical or sex-
ual assault by an intimate partner during their lifetime
(Black et al. 2011). Victimization of IPV is associated with
significant health burdens and has been linked to a number
of psychological (Shorey et al. 2011; Beydoun et al. 2012;
Próspero 2007; Próspero and Kim 2009; Okuda et al. 2011)
and physical (Coker et al. 2000; Campbell et al. 2002;
Carbone-López et al. 2006; Bonomi et al. 2007; Ellsberg
et al. 2008; Straus et al. 2009) health consequences.
Despite a growing evidence base on the prevalence,
risk factors, and intervention programs for IPV, much of
the literature focuses on risk factors and intervention ef-
forts for victims of IPV, with relatively little emphasis on
perpetrators. As a result, there are few empirically sup-
ported interventions for IPV perpetrators (Eckhardt
et al. 2006). Some researchers suggest that the limited
effectiveness of prevention and intervention efforts is
the result of the oversimplification of antecedents to per-
petration, especially the contextual factors at the time of
perpetration (Bell and Naugle 2008).
Stress, the individualized response to challenging situ-
ations, is associated with increased risk for IPV (Capaldi
et al. 2012; Cano and Vivian 2001; Mason and Smithey
2012; Roberts et al. 2011). However, few studies have
examined specific stressors, which are the events that
trigger the stress response, as antecedents to IPV perpet-
ration (Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al. 2012a; Elkins et al.
2013; Whitaker 2013; Byun 2012; Shortt et al. 2013).
The Catalyst Model of Aggression hypothesized individ-
uals develop a predisposition to violence as a result of
personal characteristics (e.g., genes, personality) and his-
torical environmental factors (e.g., exposure to violence)
(Ferguson and Dyck 2012). Individuals with a high pre-
disposition to violence are more likely to respond to en-
vironmental triggers (e.g., social interactions, stressors)
with violence, compared with individuals with a lower
predisposition to violence (Ferguson and Dyck 2012).
Although untested for IPV perpetration, there is some
evidence the Catalyst Model predicts other forms of vio-
lence perpetration (Ferguson et al. 2013; Ferguson et al.
2008b; Ferguson et al. 2008a).
Financial stress often impacts both individuals and the
couple (Mason and Smithey 2012) and is a commonly
cited antecedent to IPV perpetration (Byun 2012; Slep
et al. 2010; Neff et al. 1995). However, IPV is not more
prevalent in areas with low neighborhood income or
high socioeconomic deprivation, which may be indica-
tive of the financial stressors experienced by residents
(Khalifeh et al. 2013; Bonomi et al. 2014). This difference
in findings highlights the difference between stressors
(the event) and stress (the response). Individual stress
responses to environmental stressors vary as a result of a
wide range of factors, such as genes (Bouma et al. 2012)
and prior experiences (Lovallo 2013), so the relationship
between financial context and IPV perpetration may de-
pend on the distinction between financial stress and
stressors (Benson et al. 2003). Perceptions of financial
stress (individuals' processing of stressor events), are
significantly associated with IPV victimization among
women, but more objective measures of financial
stressors (the event which causes the stress response),
such as income to needs ratio, are not significantly
associated with IPV victimization (Benson et al. 2003).
Additionally, perceived financial stress is a significant
predictor of physical IPV perpetration among both men
and women in two studies (Neff et al. 1995; Slep et al.
2010). To our knowledge, there have been no studies of
the relationship between specific financial stressors and
IPV perpetration so it is unclear if exposure to financial
stressors is an antecedent to IPV perpetration.
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the extent
to which experiences of specific financial stressors are
associated with making threats of violence/minor
physical IPV perpetration, severe physical IPV perpet-
ration, and physical IPV resulting in injury, as re-
ported by perpetrators. Given the limited effectiveness
of IPV prevention and intervention efforts, it is im-
portant to understand modifiable risk factors, such as
stressors, and their relationship with IPV perpetration.
The results of this analysis may have important impli-
cations for the development and implementation of
IPV prevention and intervention activities, especially
those targeting social context at the time of IPV
perpetration.
Methods
We performed a secondary analysis of the Wave IV data
of The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to
Adult Health (Add Health). The Add Health study began
in 1994 and continued through 2008 with four waves of
data collection (Harris et al. 2009; 2013). The study
design included systematic sampling methods and
stratification to ensure the sample was representative
of the United States population of adolescents (Harris
et al. 2009; 2013). Of the 20,745 participants who en-
rolled in the study, 15,701 were interviewed during
the 2008 Wave IV when they were between the ages
of 24 and 32 years (Harris et al. 2009; 2013). Add-
itional information on the study design, including in-
formation on the institutional review board approval
and informed consent process, is available elsewhere
(Harris et al. 2009; 2013).
Schwab-Reese et al. Injury Epidemiology (2016) 3:6 Page 2 of 10
To be eligible for this analysis, participants must have
been in a relationship during the past year. IPV perpet-
ration was measured as occurring within the last 12-
months of the most recent relationship. Since measure-
ment of exposure to financial stressors was limited to
the 12 months prior to the interview, participants who
reported on relationship experiences more distant than
the prior 12 months were excluded. Additionally, partici-
pants who were incarcerated during the interview were
excluded because the outcomes for this analysis required
the ability to have physical contact with an intimate
partner. Participants were also excluded if they did not
respond to questions about IPV perpetration, financial
stressors, or study covariates.
A total of 15,701 participants completed data collec-
tion during Wave IV of the Add Health study. Of these
participants, 3320 (21.1 %) were excluded because they
were not in a relationship during the past twelve months
and/or were currently incarcerated. Of the remaining
12,381 participants, 882 (7.1 %) were excluded due to
missing data for IPV questions, financial stressors, or
other covariates, resulting in a sample size of 11,499.
As recommended by the Add Health research team,
we set the weight of any excluded participants to
0.000001, which ensures the weighting process is cor-
rectly completed, but excluded participants do not
contribute to the estimates produced by the models
(Chen and Chantala 2014). Dropping participants
from the weighting protocol would result in unrepre-
sentative weights and incorrect standard errors (Chen and
Chantala 2014).
Measurement
Intimate partner violence perpetration
The outcomes of this analysis were three forms of phys-
ical IPV: making threats of physical IPV/minor physical
IPV ("How often have you threatened [partner] with vio-
lence, pushed or shoved (him/her), or thrown something
at (him/her) that could hurt?); severe physical IPV (How
often have you slapped, hit, or kicked [partner]?); and
physical IPV resulting in injury (How often has [partner]
had an injury, such as a sprain, bruise, or cut because of
a fight with you?) (Harris et al. 2009; 2013).
Participants reported how frequently they perpetrated
each form of IPV on a scale ranging from "never" to
"more than twenty times in the last year". Each question
was dichotomized to categorize participants as perpet-
rating this form of IPV at least once in the prior year or
not perpetrating this form. Using these questions, we
created mutually exclusive categorizations of the pat-
terns of IPV perpetration, which were used in the
multinomial models: only threats/minor physical; only
severe physical; threats/minor physical and severe
physical; and all three forms including physical resulting
in injury. Thirty-two participants (0.2 %) reported perpet-
rating severe physical IPV and IPV resulting in an in-
jury but not threats/minor IPV. Given the small
number, these participants were excluded from the
multinomial models of patterns of IPV but were in-
cluded in all other analyses.
Financial stressors
Participants reported if they had experienced six types of
financial stressors at least once in the past twelve
months: nonpayment of utilities for financial reasons,
nonpayment of housing for financial reasons, fears of
food unavailability, phone disconnected due to financial
reasons, utilities turned-off due to nonpayment, and
eviction from housing (Harris et al. 2009; 2013).
We summed the total number of financial stressors
experienced by each participant, which ranged from zero
(no financial stressors in past year) to six (all forms of fi-
nancial stressors in the past year), which is consistent
with prior treatment of this measure (Halliday Hardie
and Lucas 2010). We created models using both the
total number of financial stressors and each individual
type of financial stressor. Additional information on the
treatment of the exposure and outcome variables is in-
cluded in Appendix.
Covariates
We considered a range of possible covariates with rela-
tionships to IPV perpetration and/or financial stressors.
We selected our covariates based on a literature review
and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) (Shrier and Platt
2008), a visual representation of the assumed relation-
ships between the variables of interest and their covari-
ates, which allows for careful selection of covariates to
avoid introducing bias through covariate selection. Se-
lected covariates included gender, race, health, neuroti-
cism, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. We also considered
controlling for perceived stress and relationship conflict,
but conceptualized those variables as part of the causal
pathway between financial stressors and IPV perpetra-
tion. We also considered controlling for education and
employment, but felt that the potential bias of those var-
iables was, in our conceptualization, controlled through
the selected covariates.
Gender and race were measured using participant
self-report. Perceived health was measured as partici-
pant self-reported general health. Neuroticism was
measured using the NEO-FFI scale (Harris et al. 2009),
which summed responses to twelve questions to create
a single measure of neuroticism. Alcohol abuse was
measured as self-reported experience of the diagnostic
criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse as defined by the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV) (American Psychological Association 1994)
Schwab-Reese et al. Injury Epidemiology (2016) 3:6 Page 3 of 10
such as increased tolerance, withdrawal symptoms,
and/or social or interpersonal issues related to alcohol
use. Drug abuse was measured using the number of
self-reported symptoms consistent with DSM-IV diag-
nostic criteria for drug abuse, including failure to per-
form role obligations, legal problems, and/or social or
interpersonal issues associated with drug use (American
Psychological Association 1994).
Statistical analysis
All analyses were weighted and clustered by school and
primary sampling unit to account for the survey design
of the Add Health study as recommended by the Carolina
Population Center (Chen and Chantala 2014). All descrip-
tive analyses reported the weighted point estimates and
95 % confidence intervals for the estimates. Chi-square
tests were used to determine if exposure to financial
stressors and rates of IPV perpetration were equal across
gender (Table 1).
Weighted, clustered, single-variable and multivariable
regression models were used to estimate the association
between each financial stressor, the total number of fi-
nancial stressors, and IPV perpetration. IPV perpetration
was modeled two ways. First, we modeled each form of
IPV separately in logistic regression, which models the
odds of perpetrating the specific form of IPV compared
with participants who did not perpetrate that form of
IPV (Table 2). In this analysis, categorizations were not
mutually exclusive and may have resulted in substantial
heterogeneity of the comparison group, because it in-
cluded participants who perpetrated no forms of IPV
but also those who perpetrated other forms of IPV.
To reduce this heterogeneity, we used multinomial
logit regression models, which modeled IPV as mutu-
ally exclusive categorizations of perpetration com-
pared to no IPV perpetration (Table 3). Although the
first method of analysis is more common in the lit-
erature, multinomial logit regression models may be a
more precise method of analysis when multiple out-
comes co-occur (Fulu et al. 2013).
We also examined gender as a possible modifier of the
relationship between financial stressors and IPV perpet-
ration. We assessed moderation by including an inter-
action term of gender and the exposure variable in the
final models and examining the significance of the inter-
action term.
Results
Descriptive statistics
Significantly more women (27.7 %) than men (22.9 %)
experienced at least one financial stressor (Table 1). A
higher percentage of women than men reported experi-
encing three of the six types of financial stressors. A sig-
nificantly higher number of women than men were
unable to pay their utilities (17.6 % vs 12.7 %), reported
food insecurity (14.0 % vs 9.9 %), and experienced dis-
connected phone service (10.4 % vs 7.8 %). Men and
women experienced housing nonpayment, having util-
ities turned-off, and eviction in approximately the same
proportions.

A significantly higher number of women reported per-
petrating threats/minor physical IPV (11.4 % vs 6.7 %)
and severe physical IPV (8.8 % vs 3.4 %). However,
among perpetrators of physical IPV, a significantly
higher number of men reported causing injury to their
partner (32.0 % vs 21.0 %). Overall, 92.9 % (95 % CI:
92.0­93.8) of men and 86.7 % (95 % CI: 85.5­88.2) of
women did not perpetrate any form of IPV in the
prior year.
Intimate partner violence and financial stressors
We did not find evidence to support significant moder-
ation of the relationship between financial stressors and
IPV perpetration by gender. Since stratification did not
significantly influence the results, we report only the
combined results. In short, although women experience
both IPV perpetration and financial stressors at a higher
rate, the associations of financial stressors and IPV per-
petration were not significantly different between men
and women.
Overall, the number of financial stressors was strongly
associated with each form of physical IPV, after adjusting
for gender, race, perceived health, neuroticism, alcohol
use, and drug use (Table 2). For each additional financial
stressor, the odds of perpetration increased 1.16 times
(95 % CI: 1.09­1.23) for threats/minor physical IPV, 1.22
times (95 % CI: 1.14­1.30) for severe physical IPV, and
1.27 times (95 % CI: 1.16­1.38) for IPV resulting in
injury.
Four of the six types of financial stressor were associ-
ated with significantly higher odds of perpetrating each
form of physical IPV compared to all others in the sam-
ple. In adjusted analysis, utilities nonpayment, housing
nonpayment, food insecurity, and disconnected phone
service were associated with increased odds of each form
of physical IPV. In addition, the odds of perpetrating se-
vere physical IPV were 2.39 times higher (95 % CI: 1.35­
4.23 %) among those who were evicted compared to
those who were not evicted.
In the remaining analysis, individuals who perpe-
trated each specific pattern of IPV were compared to
those who perpetrated no forms of IPV (Table 3). In
adjusted analyses, an increasing number of financial
stressors was not associated with significantly in-
creased odds of perpetrating only threats/minor phys-
ical IPV compared with perpetrating no IPV. However,
the odds of perpetrating only severe physical IPV (OR:
1.20; 95 % CI:1.05­1.38), both threats/minor and se-
vere physical IPV (OR: 1.19; 95 % CI: 1.08­1.32), and
for all three forms of IPV (OR: 1.29; 95 % CI:1.18­
1.41) significantly increased with each additional finan-
cial stressor, compared to individuals who did not
perpetrate IPV.
The relationships between individual financial stressors
and IPV perpetration were not consistent across pat-
terns of perpetration, although more severe patterns
of violence were associated with more of the individ-
ual financial stressors. In adjusted analysis, only food
insecurity remained significantly associated with per-
petration of only threats/minor physical IPV com-
pared to perpetrating no IPV. Comparatively, utilities
nonpayment, housing nonpayment, food insecurity,
and disconnected phone service were significantly as-
sociated with perpetrating all three forms of physical
IPV compared with individuals who perpetrated no
physical IPV.

Discussion
As hypothesized by the Catalyst Model of Aggression,
exposure to stressors, specifically financial stressors, was
associated with physical IPV perpetration among men
and women. Consistent with the prior literature on the
inequalities in wage and wealth acquisition by gender
(Autor et al. 2008; Ruel and Hauser 2013) and IPV per-
petration by gender (Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al.
2012b), a higher proportion of women reported experi-
encing financial stressors and perpetrating physical IPV.
With few exceptions, both the number of financial
stressors and the individual financial stressors were asso-
ciated with increased odds of making threats/minor
physical IPV, severe physical IPV, and IPV resulting in
injury. There were some differences in these relation-
ships when we examined specific patterns of perpetra-
tion. For example, the overall number of financial
stressors was a significant predictor of threats/minor
physical IPV perpetration when modeled as anyone who
had perpetrated this form of IPV compared with all
other participants, including perpetrators of other types
of IPV. However, the overall number of financial
stressors was not a significant predictor of threats/minor
physical IPV perpetration when modeled as people who
only perpetrated threats/minor IPV compared with indi-
viduals who perpetrated no IPV. This result suggests
that exposure to financial stressors did not increase the
odds of only threats/minor physical IPV perpetration. It
did, however, increase the odds of this form of IPV in
combination with other forms. These divergent findings
have significant implications for the measurement and
analysis of IPV perpetration. Although much of the lit-
erature has reported the results of separate models for
each type of IPV outcome, the difference in findings be-
tween the two methods may support the use of multi-
nomial models when predicting overlapping outcomes,
such as multiple forms of IPV.
An unexpected finding was the overall lack of associ-
ation between more severe forms of financial stressors
and IPV perpetration. For example, in the multinomial
model, eviction was not associated with perpetration of
only threats/minor physical IPV, only severe physical
IPV, or all three forms. Eviction was only associated with
perpetration of both threats/minor and severe physical
IPV. Similarly, having the utilities turned off was not as-
sociated with any of the patterns IPV perpetration, when
compared to individuals who perpetrated no forms of
physical IPV. This finding was unexpected because prior
research suggested financial issues related to housing are
more strongly associated with physical and mental mani-
festations of stress than food insecurity (Liu et al. 2014).
Additionally, individuals who experienced moderate
levels of housing strain (i.e., at least one late or incom-
plete payment) have reported substantially lower levels
of psychological and physical distress compared with in-
dividuals who have been removed from their home due
to nonpayment (Cannuscio et al. 2012). Additional re-
search is necessary to further examine if the limited as-
sociation between severe financial stressors and IPV
perpetration is limited to this dataset, if it is a function
of examining individual financial experiences rather than
patterns of experiences, or if other factors may be con-
tributing to this relationship.
Our results were, overall, consistent with the small
body of literature connecting experience with financial
stress to IPV. Our literature review identified nine stud-
ies on the associations between financial context and
IPV perpetration. Three of those studies focused exclu-
sively on male-perpetrated IPV as reported by the female
victims (Bonomi et al. 2014; Byun 2012; Golden et al.
2013). Economic abuse, defined as behaviors that control
a partner's ability to be economically secure, is common
among women who experience other forms of abuse
(Adams et al. 2008). In addition, economic abuse may
alter women's perceptions of financial stress, so those re-
sults were not directly comparable to the results of this
study (Postmus et al. 2011; Matjasko et al. 2013). How-
ever, each of these studies contributed to our general
understanding of the role of financial stress in IPV
perpetration.
One additional study examined the association of
socioeconomic deprivation and IPV victimization
among men and women (Khalifeh et al. 2013). Low
social class, measured as the occupational classifica-
tion of respondent, and low income were strongly as-
sociated with lifetime experiences of physical IPV
among women but not among men (Khalifeh et al.
2013). However, these results must be interpreted
with caution because it was unknown if current eco-
nomic status was consistent with economic status at
the time of the IPV victimization.
Two studies examined the association between finan-
cial stress and IPV as reported by the perpetrator. In a
sample of men and women from Texas, perceived finan-
cial stress was a significant predictor of physical IPV
perpetration among both men and women after adjust-
ing for income, traditional beliefs about gender roles,
and perpetrator and victim alcohol use (Neff et al. 1995.)
In a study of men and women enlisted in the US Air
Force, financial stress was also associated with physical
IPV perpetration among both men and women (Slep
et al. 2010). Generally, our findings were similar to these
two studies, but we further examined the role of specific
types of financial stressors, rather than overall percep-
tion of financial stress. Additionally, we expanded upon
these findings to include multiple forms of physical IPV
perpetration and found financial stressors were, overall,
not associated with only making threats of physical IPV
Schwab-Reese et al. Injury Epidemiology (2016) 3:6 Page 7 of 10
or minor physical IPV. However, overall number of
stressors and individual types of stressors were signifi-
cantly associated with more severe forms of IPV
perpetration.
Finally, one study focused on male perpetrated IPV
and included reports of both IPV and financial stress by
both partners (Benson et al. 2003). In this study, subject-
ive financial stress was strongly associated with in-
creased odds of male-to-female physical IPV, but
income-to-needs ratio, a more objective measure of fi-
nancial stressors, was not associated with IPV perpetra-
tion. Our analysis was unable to measure perceptions of
financial stress, defined as how individuals mentally re-
spond to financial stressors, but it did find that experien-
cing financial stressors was associated with increased
odds of IPV perpetration among men and women. The
discrepancy between our findings and the findings on
income-to-needs ratio may have important implications
for intervention strategies because it may indicate that
subjective financial stress and management of finances
are better predictors of IPV perpetration than overall
financial resources. Additional research examining the
relative contributions of financial stress, financial
stressors, and financial management may provide further
guidance on effective financial interventions.
Implications for intervention
In combination with prior findings, our findings have
implications for the development of interventions to
prevent IPV through improving the financial context of
couples. Among female victims of IPV, career counseling
has been shown to improve perceptions of financial
well-being (Chronister et al. 2011; Davidson et al. 2012),
however, it is not clear if career counseling would be ef-
fective to reduce exposure to financial stressors. Direct
economic intervention (i.e., providing funds) may be an-
other method of IPV prevention (Matjasko et al. 2013;
Kim et al. 2007). However, a systematic review of eco-
nomic interventions in low-income countries found
mixed results in reducing IPV (Yvas and Watts 2009) so
additional research is necessary before this type of inter-
vention is implemented.
Our findings suggest less severe forms of financial
stressors (e.g., utilities nonpayment) have a stronger as-
sociation with IPV perpetration than the more severe
forms of financial stressors (e.g., utilities turned off).
However, individuals often experience the less severe
forms of financial stressors prior to experiencing the
more severe forms so interventions may effectively pre-
vent IPV perpetration if they target individuals in the
early stages of financial stressor experiences.
Future interventions may be guided by additional re-
search into the differing relationships of IPV perpetra-
tion and perceptions of financial stress, specific financial
stressors, and overall financial resources. Disentangling
the relative contributions of financial stress resulting
from poor financial management compared with finan-
cial stress resulting from limited financial resources may
provide additional guidance into the most effective inter-
vention methods. The development of future interven-
tions may also be enhanced by additional information
on the financial experiences of perpetrators. Our litera-
ture review suggests victims and their experiences are
often the focus of this line of research so additional re-
search on the financial experiences of victims, perpetra-
tors, and victim-perpetrators may further guide the
development and tailoring of effective interventions.
Limitations
We relied upon self-report of IPV experiences by the
perpetrator. A recent study suggests the reported rates
of IPV vary significantly if IPV is measured based on re-
ports by only the perpetrator, the victim, or both, so in-
cluding reports of IPV by both partners would improve
the study design (Renner et al. 2015). Additionally, our
analysis is at the level of the individual, which limits our
ability to make temporal inferences about the experi-
ences of financial stressors and IPV perpetration. Since
exposure to financial stressors may change over time,
conducting an analysis at the event-level may be a better
method of determining the relationship between finan-
cial stressors and IPV perpetration. For example, a re-
cent study of the association between anger and IPV
perpetration asked participants to complete daily diaries
of their affect and their experiences with their partner
(Elkins et al. 2013). By collecting data every day, the re-
searchers were better able to determine the temporal as-
sociation between the two factors. Another possible
limitation is related to our treatment of the financial
stressor variables. Our analysis examined number and
type of financial stressors and did not examine patterns
of stressors. As these stressors may occur simultan-
eously, additional research on the co-occurrence of mul-
tiple forms of financial stressors and relationships of
patterns of co-occurring stressors with IPV perpetration
may further enhance our understanding of these rela-
tionships. Finally, our analysis used secondary data,
which limited operationalization of constructs to the
variables collected in the study.
Conclusions
Financial stressors are associated with physical IPV
perpetration, but the relationship between specific fi-
nancial stressors and IPV perpetration varies by the
type of IPV perpetrated. These findings suggest inter-
vention and prevention programs to reduce financial
stressors may be a novel way to reduce future phys-
ical IPV perpetration.
