Context: Recent recommendations to decrease the upper limit of the
TSH reference range from 4.5 to 2.5 mIU/liter, based on the high
proportion of normal people whose serum TSH is less than 2.5 mIU/
liter and the observation that those with TSH between 2.5 and 4.5
mIU/liter [upper reference range (URR)] have increased risk of pro-
gression to overt hypothyroidism (Whickham, 20-yr data), have not
been subjected to critical analysis.
Study Subjects: The study subjects were from the Reference Group
of NHANES III, 14,333 people more than 12 yr old, without known
thyroid disease or antithyroid antibodies; 85% had TSH levels below
2.5 mIU/liter, and 2.3% had subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). An
additional 9.7% had URR TSH, representing 20.6 million Americans,
who would also be identified as SCH if the upper TSH limit were
decreased. Many with URR TSH do not have thyroid disease.
Intervention: The time of phlebotomy is important, because the TSH
level varies throughout the day, with early morning values greater
than later ones, and is accentuated by sleep deprivation, strenuous
exercise, or working during the night or evening shifts. Repeated
measurements in the same individual vary considerably over months.
Results: About half of those with URR TSH probably have thyroid
disease, but most with thyroid disease, antithyroid peroxidase anti-
bodies, have TSH below 2.5 mIU/liter. Those with URR TSH with
thyroid disease probably have minimal thyroid deficiency, without
any reported adverse health consequences or benefit of treatments
with levothyroxine.
Conclusion: Because routine levothyroxine treatment is not recom-
mended for SCH, it is certainly not warranted in individuals with
URR TSH. For all patients with URR TSH, it is reasonable to deter-
mine serum TSH every 1­2 yr. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 90:
5489­5496, 2005)
PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM IS one of the most com-
mon endocrine disorders, affecting many millions
around the world. Although experienced clinicians may sus-
pect severe hypothyroidism, more often the symptoms and
signs of this disease are subtle and neither sensitive nor
specific for the disorder. Therefore, the diagnosis of hypo-
thyroidism requires measurement of serum TSH in conjunc-
tion with the serum free T4
concentration (1). The inverse
logarithmic relationship between free T4
and TSH means that
small changes in the serum free T4
concentration can, in turn,
lead to much more dramatic changes in serum TSH.
Hypothyroidism ranges from mild to severe. Overt pri-
mary hypothyroidism is characterized by decreased serum
free T4
and increased serum TSH levels. The term subclinical
hypothyroidism (SCH), also called mild hypothyroidism,
refers to a laboratory abnormality characterized by an ele-
vated serum TSH with a normal free T4
concentration (2­4).
Patients with these findings may or may not be symptomatic.
Other causes of elevated serum TSH should be excluded.
There is a continuum between the euthyroid state and hy-
pothyroidism, as there is between normal and elevated se-
rum TSH concentrations. Therefore, the distinction between
a normal and an elevated serum TSH level is somewhat
arbitrary. However, it has been used to distinguish individ-
uals with normal thyroid function, who may or may not have
underlying thyroid pathology, from those with SCH. In cur-
rent assays, the upper limit of the TSH reference range is
approximately 4.5 mIU/liter (5).
In 2003, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinol-
ogists issued a statement encouraging "doctors to consider
treatment for patients who test out of the boundaries of a
narrower margin based on a target TSH level of 0.3­3.0
mIU/liter (6). Respected authorities have echoed this rec-
ommendation and even suggested that the range be further
contracted to an upper limit of normal of 2.5 mIU/liter (7­
11). However, decreasing the upper limits of normal for
serum TSH may have enormous health and economic im-
plications and should not be undertaken without extensive
discussion and consideration. Comprehensive analyses, dis-
cussions, and debate preceded changes in criteria for diag-
nosing diabetes mellitus (12), hypertension (13), and hyper-
cholesterolemia (14). In each of these instances the guiding
principle for change was the firm knowledge that interven-
tions employing these guidelines would have important
health benefits that outweigh potential risks. Such data are

not available for individuals whose serum TSH is between
2.5 or 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter. Moreover, many individuals
with TSH concentrations in this range do not have thyroid
disease. Therefore, we do not support a lowering of the upper
limit of the normal range for serum TSH at this time and
detail our reasons in the following discussion.
Normal Range for Serum TSH
The normal or reference range for any parameter should
provide a framework for physicians to categorize patients as
1) normal, 2) those who may require closer observation or
intervention to detect and then treat a specific adverse health
outcome, and 3), those with disease who might benefit from
treatment. For example, using glucose tolerance testing, in-
dividuals are characterized as normal, prediabetic, or dia-
betic (12); for blood pressure measurements, normal, prehy-
pertensive, and hypertensive populations have been defined
(13). Health interventions (usually lifestyle) are indicated in
the intermediate groups.
Defining a normal range for serum TSH implies that any-
one outside of this range must be abnormal and, by inference,
is a candidate for therapy. Several important questions must
be considered when defining a normal range for serum TSH.
1) What is the distribution of TSH measurements in the
population? 2) What is the reliability and reproducibility of
a given TSH measurement within and between assays? 3)
What is the stability of the measurement? Does it vary over
the course of the day and from day to day? 4) Is a serum TSH
concentration between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter highly sensitive
and specific for thyroid disease? 5) What is the natural his-
tory of a person with a serum TSH between 3.0 and 4.5
mIU/liter? Does it inevitably rise to levels seen in overt
hypothyroidism or may it return to normal? 6) What are the
risks and benefits of levothyroxine treatment in individuals
with serum TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter? 7) What are
the consequences of narrowing the TSH normal range?
TSH Distribution
NHANES III (5) provides data on the distribution of TSH,
thyroid hormones, and antithyroid antibodies in 17,353 peo-
ple (total population) that represent the weighted racial dis-
tribution of 205,562,185 individuals at or over the age of 12
yr and designed to represent the United States population.
Individuals who reported thyroid disease, goiter, or taking
thyroid medication (820 people) were excluded from the total
population, leaving 16,533 people classified as the disease-
free population. A third group of 13,334 people (the reference
population) further excluded people who had antithyroid
antibodies; were pregnant, were taking estrogens, andro-
gens, or lithium; and were without laboratory evidence of
overt hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Free T4
was not
measured in this study. Because people who are pregnant, or
treated with estrogen or androgen (1,000 in NHANES III)1
do not have significant serum TSH elevations, their exclusion
makes the reference population less than optimal for deter-
mination of TSH distribution in a population without thyroid
disease or risk factors (possibly excluding family history) for
thyroid disease.
The disease-free group represents most patients who are
evaluated for hypothyroidism, because clinicians generally
do not measure anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibod-
ies before measurement of TSH. Thus, the disease-free pop-
ulation is most appropriate for assessment of the range of
TSH that is relevant to doctors in practice. We, therefore,
present analysis of the distribution of TSH in this population.
We also present data for a new subgroup from NHANES III
without risk factors for thyroid dysfunction [disease-free
without risk factors (DF-RF)]. For the latter group, we ob-
tained unpublished population data for the disease-free pop-
ulation, excluding only the subjects with antithyroid anti-
bodies, those taking lithium, or the few discovered
biochemically to have overt hyperthyroidism or hypothy-
roidism (see Footnote 1). This new group represents a pop-
ulation without self-reported thyroid disease and no risk
factors for thyroid disease, except, possibly, a family history
of thyroid disease.
Similar to the disease-free population, the non-log-trans-
formed distribution of TSH values of this new group is sig-
nificantly skewed toward higher TSH values (Fig. 1). When
log-transformed, the histogram is closer to a Gaussian curve,
but is still skewed toward higher TSH values (Fig. 2). The
geometric mean is 1.41  0.02 (sem) mIU/liter, the median
is 1.40 mIU/liter, and the 95% reference interval (2.5th to
97.5th percentiles) is 0.45­4.17 mIU/liter.
For the disease-free population not adjusted for risk factors
for thyroid disease, the geometric mean is 1.50  0.02 (se)
mIU/liter, the median is 1.49 mIU/liter, and the 2.5th and
97.5th percentiles are 0.5 and 5.52 mIU/liter, respectively (5).
The upper limit is clearly higher in the disease-free popu-
lation than in the DF-RF, probably due to the inclusion of
some patients with thyroid autoantibodies.
Based on the serum TSH distribution for the disease-free
and disease-free population without risk factors, represent-
ing approximately 200 million individuals in the United

States, an additional 6.4­7.9% of the U.S. population at or
above age 12 yr (12.8­16 million) would be diagnosed with
hypothyroidism if the upper limit of normal for serum TSH
was 3.0 mIU/liter (Table 1). If the upper limit were further
decreased to 2.5 mIU/liter, an additional 5.4­6.3% of the
population, approximately 10.8­12.6 million individuals
would be considered hypothyroid. Thus, a total of 22­28
million additional individuals would be diagnosed if the
upper limit of the TSH range were decreased to 2.5­3.0 mIU/
liter. By comparison, 2.3­4.3% of the population (4.6­8.6
million individuals) has SCH when defined as a serum TSH
level of 5­10 mIU/liter. Lowering the upper limit to 2.5­3.0
mIU/liter in these populations would result in a 300­400%
increase in individuals considered hypothyroid. Even in the
reference population, which excludes thyroid antibody-pos-
itive subjects as well as those who are pregnant or taking
estrogens or androgens, a decrease in the upper limit of the
TSH range to 2.5­3.0 mIU/liter would result in an approx-
imately 3-fold increase in the number of people newly des-
ignated as hypothyroid (12 million). These projections are
supported by an analysis of TSH values in patients without
a history of thyroid disease in a tertiary care practice (15).
Decreasing the upper limit of the TSH reference range to 3.0
mIU/liter resulted in more than a 4-fold increase in patients
classified as hypothyroid.
Some of those who suggest that the upper limit of the TSH
range should be 2.5 mIU/liter state that 95% of the subjects
in the reference group (9) or rigorously screened normal
euthyroid volunteers (8) had TSH levels between 0.5 and 2.5
mIU/liter. We cannot find support for these statements in the
NHANES III database. Unpublished data from NHANES III
(see Footnote 1) indicate that only 81.5% of the disease-free
group, 85.9% of the DF-RF group, and 85.9% of the reference
group had TSH levels below 2.5 mIU/liter (Table 1).
Reproducibility of TSH Measurements
TSH assay characteristics depend on the reagents, proto-
cols, and technical performance of the assay. These were
defined and described previously (8). High-quality labora-
tories should have intraassay variation of less than 5% for
TSH in the range of 1.0­4.5 mIU/liter. Fewer data are avail-
able concerning interassay variation in TSH concentration
performed on the same sample. Although it is somewhat
greater than the intraassay variation, interassay variation
should still be less than 10% (8, 16­18). Thus, in appropri-
ately calibrated assays, a single TSH determination should
reasonably reflect the TSH concentration in that sample.
Stability of TSH over Time in the Same Individual
The reference range applies to populations, but clinicians
must apply the results of a single TSH determination to an
individual patient. It is particularly important for clinicians
to know whether a single TSH measurement reflects the
individual's average TSH measurement over time. There-
fore, the stability or variability of repetitive TSH determina-
tions over short periods of time is critically important.
Although such measurements are not performed in clin-
ical practice, several studies provide data showing signifi-
cant variation in repeated TSH measurements over time in
the same individuals. Fish et al. (19) measured TSH 13 times
within a 6-d interval in five patients taking the same daily
dose of levothyroxine for at least 3 months. The initial serum
TSH was normal for these patients. Considerable variation
was found when TSH was measured repeatedly, with four
of the five patients having at least one TSH value move out
of the normal range. Others have made similar observations
(20­22). Andersen et al. (22) measured thyroid hormones and
TSH in 16 healthy men monthly for 1 yr. Each man seemed
to have a specific and unique set point for thyroid hormone
concentrations. TSH measurements in any individual varied
within 50% of the TSH distribution of the entire group's
samples. The variation in serum TSH concentration in re-
peated samples from the same individual was large and
clinically significant. For example, with a mean TSH of 1.4
mIU/liter, repeated measurements in the same subject could
vary between 0.7 and 2.1 mIU/liter; with a mean TSH of 2.4
FIG. 2. When log-transformed, the histogram is closer to a Gaussian
curve, but is still skewed toward higher TSH values.

mIU/liter, the variation could be between 1.2 and 3.6 mIU/
liter; and for TSH of 3.6 mIU/liter, the variation could be
between 1.8 and 5.4 mIU/liter. Even with a mean normal
TSH of 1.7­2.4 mIU/liter, some repeated TSH measurements
would be expected to exceed the newly proposed upper
limits of normal for TSH (2.5­3.0 mU/liter) (6­11). Those
values could classify patients incorrectly as abnormal, al-
though the mean concentration over time is quite normal.
The time of phlebotomy is also important. In a clinical
practice, serum TSH obtained at 0730­0900 h in fasting pa-
tients was significantly higher in 97 of 100 consecutive in-
dividuals than TSH determined at 1030­1200 h in the post-
prandial state (23). The average decline between 0730 and
0900 and 1030 and 1200 h was 26.4%. Of 10 patients classified
as having SCH based on the fasting sample, eight were re-
classified as normal (TSH, 4.5 mIU/liter) based on the late
morning sample. Ten of 15 individuals with fasting early
morning TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mU/liter had a late morn-
ing nonfasting TSH level below 3.0 mU/liter.2 Without ad-
dressing the etiology of the TSH variation, this study does
confirm that the time of day of blood TSH sampling may
influence the serum TSH concentration, resulting in misclas-
sification as either abnormal or normal. The more narrow the
reference range, the more likely that such misclassification
will occur.
A nocturnal surge in serum TSH is well recognized. Serum
TSH approximately doubles near bedtime and begins to de-
crease to lower values at the time of sleep (24­27). The
decline in serum TSH concentration may not be complete at
0800 h, when blood sampling generally begins, resulting in
a higher serum TSH than at later times during the day. Mean
TSH between 0800 and 0945 h was between 2.47 and 3.47
mIU/liter in five healthy subjects without thyroid disease
who were sampled every 15 min between 0800 and 1800 h.
Average TSH deceased 20­32% in one or more subsequent
2-h intervals in every subject.3 This effect is amplified after
sleep deprivation (28, 29) and exercise (30). Furthermore, the
peak in pulsatile TSH secretion occurs in the morning hours
in night-shift workers and also may be variable and delayed
in those who work during the evening shift, e.g. 1600­2400
h (31). The night-shift and evening-shift workers whose
blood samples are obtained for TSH measurement 0800­1600
h would have higher TSH concentrations than their 24-h
mean levels, and some could fall into the 3.0­4.5 mIU/liter
range. In large numbers of subjects whose time of sleep is
delayed to between 0400 and 1400 h, blood sampling could
occur at their bedtime peak TSH. In the United States, 3
million people work during the conventional night shift, and
4 million work evening shifts, e.g. 1600­2400 h (32). Thus, 7
million people, 5% of the U.S. workforce over age 16 yr,
would probably have their phlebotomy at a time when serum
TSH is at or near its highest level of the day. Results based
on that determination might result in misclassification.
Specificity of TSH between 3.0 and 5.0 mIU/liter
for Hypothyroidism
Before making any clinical decisions based on a single
serum TSH determination between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter,
TSH determination should be repeated within several weeks
to several months to exclude transient thyroid dysfunction or
other disorders (2, 3). Common causes of transient TSH el-
evations in a disease-free group include subacute, lympho-
cytic, or postpartum thyroiditis and recovery from a non-
thyroidal illness (2).
The presence of anti-TPO antibodies is prima facie evidence
of autoimmune thyroid disease and predicts an increased
risk for development of SCH or overt hypothyroidism when
serum TSH is greater than 2.0 mIU/liter (33). However,
many TPO antibody-positive individuals never develop
overt or subclinical hypothyroidism. We concede that many
patients with serum TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mU/liter have
anti-TPO antibodies and may have the very earliest stage of
subclinical hypothyroidism. However, among the 1719 in-
dividuals in the disease-free population who had anti-TPO
antibodies, 62.2% of them had serum TSH below 3.0 mIU/
liter (5) (see Footnote 1). Therefore, autoimmune thyroid
disease and thyroid dysfunction are not synonymous.
Anti-TPO antibodies were present in 17.5%, 24.9%, and
30.0% of patients whose TSH was between 3.0 and 3.49, 3.5
and 3.99, and 4.0 and 4.49 mIU/liter, respectively (see Foot-
note 1). Overall only 22.2% of those subjects with TSH be-
tween 3.0 and 4.49 mIU/liter in the disease-free group had
anti-TPO antibodies, whereas 77.8% did not. It is possible
that the true number of antibody-positive individuals was
underestimated in the NHANES III study, because the assays
were less sensitive than currently available tests. However,
even if the prevalence of anti-TPO antibodies were doubled,
the positive predictive value for autoimmune thyroid disease
with a TSH level between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter would still
be less than 0.5. More than 50% of individuals within this
TSH range would be anti-TPO antibody negative and mis-
labeled as having thyroid disease or hypothyroidism. In con-
trast, 56.8% of those with serum TSH between 5 and 10
mIU/liter had TPO antibodies. Because 77.8% of the disease-
free population whose serum TSH was between 3.0 and 4.49
mIU/liter did not have antithyroid antibodies, they would
probably not be at significant risk for hypothyroidism.
Given the inverse log-linear relationship between free T4
and serum TSH, the TSH response to even minor thyroid
hormone changes is markedly amplified (17). It is therefore
possible that some individuals with serum TSH near the
reference TSH median value (1.4 mU/liter) may have min-
imal thyroid dysfunction, because this value may represent
a small deviation from their own set point. A logical corollary
is that some individuals whose TSH is in the upper portion
of the reference range may not have thyroid disease, but may
actually be at their set points. Some recognized causes of
mildly elevated serum TSH concentrations in euthyroid in-
dividuals are circulating TSH variants of decreased biolog-
ical potency (34) and TSH resistance syndromes (35­37).
Spurious TSH elevations due to assay interference can also
occur with circulating heterophilic antibodies (38­40) or
antimouse IgG (41, 42).

Natural History and Consequences of Serum TSH
between 3.0 and 5.0 mIU/liter
The potential consequences of a serum TSH in the range
of 4.5­10 mIU/liter will be reviewed briefly to provide con-
text for the range of 3.0­4.5 mIU/liter. For individuals with
a serum TSH of 5­10 mIU/liter, there is an increased risk of
progression to overt hypothyroidism. The risk (33) is esti-
mated to be 2.6%/yr in the absence of anti-TPO antibodies
and 4.3%/yr in their presence. After 20 yr, hypothyroidism
developed in 33% of patients with mildly raised TSH and in
55% of similar patients who also had antithyroid antibodies
(33). Comparable results were reported in a study of patients
with elevated serum TSH levels after treatment with radio-
active iodine or thyroidectomy (43). Over a mean 9.2-yr in-
terval, overt hypothyroidism developed in 42.8% of those
with initial TSH levels greater than 6­12 mIU/liter, but in
none of the patients with initial TSH levels between 4 and 6
mIU/liter.
Not all individuals with SCH progress to overt hypothy-
roidism or even continue to have SCH. In one study of SCH
in individuals over age 55 yr, serum TSH returned to normal
in 37% during a mean follow-up period of 32 months (44).
TSH returned to normal in 61% of antibody-negative indi-
viduals and in 30% of those with positive antithyroid anti-
bodies. Of patients over the age of 60yr with TSH between
5 and 10 mIU/liter, serum TSH was normal 12 months later
in 4% of antibody-positive individuals and 11% of those
without antithyroid antibodies (45). In a recent report, 11 of
21 octogenarians with subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH,
4.7 mIU/liter) had normal thyroid function 3 yr later (46).
Thus, in treating individuals in an attempt to prevent hy-
pothyroidism, many patients who would spontaneously re-
turn to normal would be inappropriately treated.
Limited natural history data are available for individuals
with serum TSH between 2.5 and 5.0 mIU/liter. We obtained
unpublished data for rates of progression to overt hypo-
thyroidism for such patients from the Whickham study.4
Table 2 shows the 20-yr risk of developing hypothyroidism
in women within TSH levels from 1­5 mIU/liter in the pres-
ence and absence of antithyroid antibodies. When serum
TSH was between 3.0 and 5.0 mIU/liter in adults 20­40 yr
of age, the probability of developing hypothyroidism in 20
yr was less than 10%, whereas in adults 50­70 yr old, the
20-yr probability increased to 5­15%. When antithyroid anti-
bodies were present as well, the 20-yr prevalence increased to
15­30% in the younger adults and to 25­50% in the older age
group. Therefore, even in older patients, who have increased
probability of having SCH (2), the probability of developing
hypothyroidism during their life expectancy is 25­50%, and
normalization of TSH over time is common (44­46).
Other adverse health consequences have not been con-
firmed for individuals with serum TSH between 5 and 10
mIU/liter (2). An increased risk for development of athero-
sclerotic heart disease in SCH has been suggested by a cross-
sectional study that did not stratify serum TSH (47). No
progression of atherosclerosis was found in the longitudinal
component of this study. Another study (48) did not confirm
an increased risk for atherosclerotic heart disease. Several
studies of surrogate markers for heart disease suggest a pos-
sible increased risk for coronary heart disease in SCH (49­
52); other studies did not confirm significant abnormalities
when TSH was less than 10 mIU/liter (48, 53­55). Using
surrogate markers to predict outcome is fraught with hazard,
as was made painfully clear with recent data suggesting
increased risk for coronary disease with estrogens when
most surrogate studies pointed to a decreased risk. It is
therefore critically important to study the incidence of cor-
onary heart disease and mortality over time to properly
assess cardiovascular risk. Five prospective cohort datasets
are available for analysis. One 10-yr study showed an in-
crease in cardiovascular mortality only in yr 4­6 in men with
SCH, but no increase in women (56). Three studies with 4.6,
10, and 20 yr of observation did not show an increase in
adverse cardiac health outcomes when TSH was elevated (47,
57, 58). One study in octogenarians demonstrated increased
survival in patients with untreated hypothyroidism and SCH
(46). Although designed specifically to observe individuals
with low serum TSH, a 10-yr cohort study of individuals over
the age of 60 yr did not show an increase in mortality in those
with serum TSH over 5 mIU/liter; a nonsignificant trend
toward decreased mortality was found (46). No data are
available for incident atherosclerotic heart disease or mor-
tality in patients with TSH in the range of 3.0­4.5 mIU/liter.
However, it seems logical to conclude that the consequences
of TSH in this range would be even less than that for those
with TSH of 5­10 mIU/liter.
Benefits and Risks of Levothyroxine Treatment in
Patients When TSH Is 3.0­5.0 mIU/liter
There is no compelling evidence that treatment with levo-
thyroxine improves symptoms compared with placebo in
individuals with TSH in the 5.0­10 mIU/liter range (59).
Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism when serum TSH
is between 5 and 10 mIU/liter generally does not have a
beneficial effect on serum lipid profiles (60). The only doc-
umented adverse health outcome for individuals with TSH
levels between 3.0 and 5.0 mU/liter is progression to overt
hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine treatment would clearly
prevent that outcome, but at what price? As noted above,

many such individuals do not have hypothyroidism or au-
toimmune thyroid disease, and many of those who do will
spontaneously return to normal thyroid function (44­46).
Moreover, there are well-established consequences to being
labeled with an illness (61). Furthermore, levothyroxine ther-
apy is often not optimally controlled and may not be innoc-
uous. Individuals in the community who take levothyroxine
feel less well than controls who do not (62). Although the
explanation for this requires additional study, the observa-
tion is robust.
Twenty percent of levothyroxine-treated hypothyroid pa-
tients are undertreated, with TSH concentrations greater
than 5.0 mIU/liter. Twenty-one percent of levothyroxine-
treated patients are overtreated, causing subclinical hyper-
thyroidism with serum TSH below 0.4 mIU/liter. Only about
60% of levothyroxine-treated patients have serum TSH in the
target range (5, 63). These less than optimal results of levo-
thyroxine treatment may be due in part to its narrow ther-
apeutic range (64). Thus, small changes in absorption may
result in subclinical hypothyroidism or subclinical hyper-
thyroidism. Although undertreatment results only in lack of
full benefit of the drug in those who need it, overtreatment
may be associated with adverse health outcomes. Patients
with subclinical hyperthyroidism (particularly the elderly)
have a 3- to 6-fold increased risk for atrial fibrillation (65, 66).
Woman with subclinical hyperthyroidism, particularly those
who are estrogen deficient, suffer an increased rate of loss of
bone mineral and fracture (67, 68). Subclinical hyperthyroid-
ism in the elderly has also been associated with increased risk
of all cause as well as cardiovascular mortality (57). Current
estimates are that approximately 500,000 people are at in-
creased risk for these adverse outcomes of levothyroxine
treatment (69). The recent evidence that subclinical hypo-
thyroidism in the very old decreases mortality cannot be
ignored, but cannot yet be extrapolated to other age groups.
Some might suggest that educating physicians could sub-
stantially reduce these risks. However, experience teaches us
that practice patterns are very difficult to change. For exam-
ple, a recommendation not to employ the T3
resin uptake test
was made many years ago (70), but the test is still in wide use.
It is often interpreted incorrectly, leading to increased costs
of additional unnecessary testing and referral, and anxiety
for the patient and family.
Consequences of Narrowing the TSH Normal Range
In the disease-free group, 4.3% (representing 8.4 million
people) had subclinical or overt hypothyroidism (TSH, 4.49
mIU/liter; Table 1). Decreasing the upper limit of the refer-
ence range to 3.0 mIU/liter results in characterizing an ad-
ditional 7.9% of the population (15.4 million subjects) as
hypothyroid. Even when all risk factors are removed from
consideration (disease-free minus risk factors), 2.3% (3.9 mil-
lion subjects) had subclinical hypothyroidism (Table 1); us-
ing a suggested revised upper limit of 3.0 mIU/liter, an
additional 6.4% of the population (10.8 million subjects)
would be considered hypothyroid. Thus, decreasing the up-
per limit of the normal range to 3.0 mIU/liter would mark-
edly increase the number of individuals identified as hypo-
thyroid. Although labeling a patient with a TSH of 3.1 mIU/
liter as hypothyroid would not necessitate therapy, in
practice many or most nonspecialist clinicians and many
specialists are inclined to treat abnormal laboratory tests. The
low positive predictive value for thyroid disease of a TSH
level between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter, the absence of demon-
strated benefit with therapy, and the potential for harm with
therapy lead us to conclude that changing the normal TSH
range at this time is premature, unjustified, and unwise.
Conclusion
We conclude from the data at hand that the generally
accepted reference range for serum TSH, 0.40­4.2 mIU/liter
(5), should also be considered the normal range, because the
TSH range must 1) have clinical utility, 2) not result in in-
appropriate labeling of normal individuals as having SCH,
3) not result in unnecessary T4
treatment and potential ad-
verse effects of treatment, and 4) must predict a high like-
lihood of potential benefit with therapy. We concede that
some individuals with TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter
have the very earliest stage of hypothyroidism, but at the
present time, appropriate follow-up is the most prudent way
to manage these patients.
Recommendations
1) If serum TSH is between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter, the
determination should be repeated within several weeks to
months, depending on the clinical circumstances. 2) When
TSH remains in this range on repeated testing, the patient
should be carefully examined for an abnormal thyroid gland.
A family history and history of previous treatment for thy-
roid dysfunction should be obtained. These data help define
the risk of developing subclinical or overt hypothyroidism
over the long term. 3) Determination of anti-TPO antibodies
may be helpful in defining the risk of progression. However,
even in their presence, the rate of progression is 25­50% over
20 yr, depending on age. 4) With or without anti-TPO anti-
bodies, patients with TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter
could be considered at risk for hypothyroidism and should
have repeat TSH determination in 6 months to 1 yr, then, if
unchanged, about once a year. 5) Other than avoiding clinical
manifestations of overt hypothyroidism in those who would
have progressive decline in thyroid function, current data do
not support routine levothyroxine treatment in patients with
TSH between 5.0 and 10 mIU/liter. We do not, therefore,
recommend routine levothyroxine treatment of individuals
with TSH levels between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter.
