Is racial prejudice declining in Britain?1
Robert Ford
Abstract
This article employs two previously neglected indicators of racial prejudice from
the British Social Attitudes surveys to examine the social distribution of prejudices
against black and Asian Britons. Three hypotheses are proposed and tested: that
racial prejudice is declining in Britain; that this decline is principally generational
in nature; and that greater prejudice is shown towards more culturally distinct
Asian minorities than black minorities. Strong evidence is found for the first two
hypotheses, with evidence of an overall decline in prejudice and of a sharp decline
in prejudices among generations who have grown up since mass black and Asian
immigration began in the 1950s. Little evidence is found for the third hypothesis:
British reactions towards black and Asian minorities are broadly similar suggest-
ing racial differences may still be the main factor prompting white hostility to
British minorities.

Introduction
Racism and racial discrimination remain a part of everyday life for Britain's
ethnic minorities. Black and Asian Britons, who constitute nearly a tenth of the
population (Office for National Statistics 2003) are less likely to be employed
and are more likely to work in worse jobs, live in worse houses and suffer
worse health than white Britons (Modood et al. 1997; Blackaby et al. 2002).
Although some of these differences are the result of factors like lower quali-
fications and residence in more depressed parts of the country, academic
studies also find a consistent gap or `ethnic penalty' (Heath and Cheung 2007)
that cannot be explained by these. White racial prejudices are likely to be an
important explanation for these disadvantages, shown in experimental studies
where black and Asian job applicants with identical qualifications to white
applicants were disproportionately rejected by employers (Noon 1993; Esmail
and Everington 1993).

While the impact of racial prejudices on the lives on Britain's minorities
has been much studied, much less academic attention has been paid to exam-
ining the distribution of such prejudices among the white population, despite
their dramatic impact on the lives of black and Asian Britons. There have
only been two academic studies specifically attempting to examine the pat-
terns of white racial prejudice, and these have only undertaken limited
analysis using an unreliable measure of racial prejudice (Evans 2002; Rothon
and Heath 2003).2
This article utilizes two unexamined indicators of white racial prejudice to
analyse the trends in and the social distribution of racial prejudice among
white Britons. It makes three key contributions. Firstly, it shows how racial
attitudes in Britain are structured by generation, with a large decline in expres-
sions of prejudice among the cohorts who have grown up since immigration
began. Consequently, levels of racial prejudice are falling and are likely to fall
further. Secondly, it casts light on the social distribution of racial prejudice.
Levels of racial prejudice are much lower among the highly educated, the
professional classes and among women. The attitudes of these groups also
change more rapidly between generations, resulting in a divergence in racial
attitudes among the young. Thirdly, it shows that there are few differences in
the levels and social distribution of white prejudice against black and against
Asian Britons, suggesting the more distinctive cultural and religious practices
of British Asian communities do not attract greater hostility from the white
population.
Racism in decline?
Four major factors may be encouraging a decline in white racial prejudices in
Britain. Firstly, racial prejudices now lack the intellectual and cultural supports
they had in the past.Arguments about white biological, economic and cultural
superiority have lost legitimacy over the past fifty years. Claims of white racial
superiority have been thoroughly debunked by geneticists and biologists, and
have been politically and socially marginalized as a result of their strong
association with Nazi fascism and the Holocaust. The belief that white Euro-
pean cultures are economically superior has become harder to maintain in the
face of rapid economic development in East Asia, India and elsewhere.
Rudyard Kipling's `white man's burden' argument that only white rule can
produce stable and democratic governance in poor colonial societies, has been
dealt a severe blow by the manifold abuses and subsequent collapse of the
European colonial empires and the white minority regimes in South Africa,
Zimbabwe and the American South.3 While these biological, economic and
political arguments for white superiority are not the only bases on which racial

prejudices form, they are powerful supports for such prejudices as they all
make a strong and allegedly empirical case for the inferiority of non-white
groups.
Secondly, racially prejudiced arguments have also lost all elite political
support in Britain. The rapid increase in black and Asian immigration in the
1960s and 1970s was accompanied by a surge in support for openly discrimi-
natory politicians, such as Enoch Powell and his supporters within the Con-
servative party and the extreme right National Front (Schoen 1977; Husbands
1983). However since the early 1980s, when reforms to immigration policy
sharply reduced immigration rates4 and quelled public anxiety, expressions of
racial prejudice have become unacceptable among Britain's political elites.
The need to integrate Britain's growing ethnic minority populations and
combat the damaging effects of prejudice and discrimination have lead to a
political consensus built around the celebration of diversity (Solomos 1989;
Layton-Henry 1992). Public figures who make even mildly prejudiced com-
ments are now roundly condemned and swiftly despatched.
Thirdly, it has become harder to argue that Britain's ethnic minority groups
are not truly `British'. The white British are exposed on an everyday basis to
black and Asian Britons on the television, the radio and the sports field. As a
result, the ethnic minorities these elite performers represent occupy a much
more prominent place in the `imagined community' (Anderson 1991) of the
British nation. As Paul Gilroy puts it: `Nobody post-Lenny, Lennox and
Linford, Scarey, Denise and Naomi, could doubt that there is, after all, some
kind of black somewhere in or rather underneath the Union Jack.' (Gilroy
2002: xxiv). This argument is supported by empirical analysis of British
national identity beliefs, which show a sharp decline in the importance
accorded to whiteness and British ancestry as markers of `being British' (or
English, Scottish, Welsh) among those born since mass immigration began
(Tilley, Exley and Heath 2004).
Fourth, social contact with ethnic minorities has also become a much more
frequent occurrence for many white Britons. Britain's ethnic minority commu-
nities have grown rapidly and have become more geographically dispersed,
with large numbers migrating internally as they grow older and richer, moving
from the inner city areas where they first settled to the more prosperous and
previously all-white suburbs and rural areas (Simpson 2007). Ethnic minorities
have also become more socially dispersed. First generation migrants, who
often lacked British qualifications or English language skills, were concen-
trated in poorly paid manual jobs. Their British born children and grandchil-
dren are much better qualified and many more have succeeded in securing
white-collar jobs, despite continuing discrimination (Berthoud 2000; Heath
and Cheung 2007). As a result of these developments most white Britons are
now much more likely to regularly encounter black and Asian faces in their
neighbourhoods and in their workplaces. This increases the chances of

informal social contact in relaxed environments, which research has shown
helps to break down racial prejudices (Pettigrew 1997; McLaren 2003). These
four prominent social trends all suggest that levels of white prejudice against
black and Asian minorities should now be declining.
Hypothesis 1:White prejudice against ethnic minorities is declining in Britain.
Is racial prejudice an attitude or a `value'?
An important issue that has received relatively little attention in debates about
racism in Britain is the nature of racially prejudiced beliefs. Most beliefs
expressed in public opinion can be characterized as either attitudes or as
values. Attitudes are less stable than values, and often less informed. They are
`off the top of the head' opinions formed `on the basis of whatever consider-
ations are most immediately salient' (Zaller 1992: 266).Values are less respon-
sive to changes in current conditions, tending instead to be moulded by
conditions in an individuals' youth and early adulthood, and remaining stable
thereafter (Mannheim 1952; Inglehart 1997). While considerable controversy
exists about where most public attitudes fit on this spectrum it is generally
accepted that complex political issue debates, which tend to elicit less stable
and coherent responses from the public, fall more on the `top of the head' side
of the spectrum (Converse 1964; Zaller 1992). Core value orientations, such as
general ideological preferences for redistribution or the free market, tend to
fall more on the `stable, formed in youth' side (Evans, Heath and Lalljee 1996;
Tilley 2002).
We may expect racial prejudice to behave more like a value for two reasons.
Firstly, while policy debates about diversity and multiculturalism are complex
and multifaceted, the underlying division over race and racism is clear and
widely understood: an individual either holds negative views about an ethnic
group or she does not. Secondly, racial attitudes involve an explicit value
judgment: expressing prejudice means rejecting the right of a racially defined
group to equal regard and equal treatment. Racial prejudices may therefore be
more like core value orientations, with individuals retaining throughout their
lives the general views about ethnic minority groups that they formed in youth.
The kind of decline we can expect in racial prejudice will be affected by the
kind of belief it is. If racial prejudice is primarily an attitudinal response to
current circumstances, then the shift in attitudes should be more rapid and
more evenly distributed across all respondents, as they will all be sensitive to
the changed social environment. On the other hand, if prejudices against
minority groups resemble other core political values, we may expect them to
change more slowly, and to show a generational structure. The rapid ethnic
diversification of Britain since 1950 means younger generations are far more

exposed to black and Asian minorities during the years when values are
formed, both directly through social contact and indirectly through media and
political elites.We should therefore see progressive declines in racial prejudice
in generations growing up since the beginning of mass migration, as the
members of each successive cohort will have had progressively more con-
tact with minorities and minority culture during their impressionable years.
However, although shifts in attitudes between generations may be large, the
overall pace of attitude change will be much slower, as it will be primarily
driven by generational replacement.
Hypothesis 2: The pattern of change in racial prejudice will be affected by
whether prejudice behaves like an attitude or a value:
(a) If prejudice behaves like an attitude, responses will be evenly distributed
across age groups and changes in responses will be rapid.
(b) If racial prejudice is a value, responses will be structured by generation,
and the overall rate of change in responses will be slower.
The nature of British prejudice: aversion to `blackness' or cultural racism?
Much of the most insightful writing on race and racism in modern Britain has
been less focused on changes in the overall prevalence of racial prejudices than
with understanding the origins and content of racist beliefs and the related
development of anti-racist ideologies used to combat them (Centre for Con-
temporary Cultural Studies 1982; Gilroy 1987, 2002; Modood 1994, 2005).
Early studies of British racism, while acknowledging that cultural differences
also provoke hostility, were in no doubt that the most important factor pro-
voking hostility and discrimination was skin colour (Daniel 1968; Rose and
associates 1969). Reacting to these findings, anti-racist theorists of the 1970s
and 1980s argued that the cultural differences between black and Asian
minorities were less important than their common experience of white dis-
crimination and hostility as `black' groups.They believed that the best strategy
to combat racial prejudice was for all `black' minorities to mobilize against it
together (Gilroy 1987, 2002; Solomos 1989).
More recently, Nira Yuval-Davis,Tariq Modood and others have taken issue
with this approach (Anthias and Yuval-Davis 1992; Modood 1994, 2005).These
scholars argue that in modern Britain, where biological arguments about race
have lost all legitimacy, `colour racism' is a declining problem. Colour matters
as a means for identifying members of cultural minorities, and it is the percep-
tion of essential and irreducible differences in values and cultural practices
between such racially identified groups and the majority which generates
prejudice and discrimination, a phenomenon Modood calls `cultural racism'.
Modood argues that this cultural racism particularly affects Asian minorities,
Is racial prejudice declining in Britain? 613

whose cultures, languages and religious beliefs differ more from the majority,
and attract greater white hostility:
South Asians . . . are clearly visible as a non-white group: they are a prin-
cipal object of racist victimization, of negative treatment by whites on the
grounds that they are an undesirable `Other'. They suffer, therefore, from
color racism. But they also suffer from cultural racism: a certain culture is
attributed to them, is vilified, and is even the ground for discrimination-
. . . .The perception of Asians . . . is that their defects lie deep in their
culture rather than in a biology that produces their culture. This means
that Asians, more than blacks, suffer a double racism. (Modood 2005: 7,
emphasis added)
One of the original theorists of a unified `blackness' experienced by all British
minorities, Paul Gilroy, has in recent writing lamented this `turn away from the
simple efficacy of blackness'. He claims it has made `anti-racism less politically
focused and certainly more difficult if not impossible to organise' (Gilroy 2002,
p. xiv). Gilroy dismisses claims about the primacy of cultural markers of
difference as `an imploded, narcissistic obsession with the minutiae of ethnic-
ity', although he provides no empirical evidence for his claim that British
racism has been, and continues to be, primarily a dualistic black/white
phenomenon. Modood, by contrast, cites evidence from documentaries and
academic studies to support his contention that culture now matters as much
as colour, to the disadvantage of Asians, who are victims of a `double racism'
(Modood 2005: 33­7) as a result. Two competing predictions can therefore be
drawn from this debate about the nature of British racism:
Hypothesis 3 (a) If racial prejudice is primarily a matter of `blackness', there
should be little difference in the level of prejudice directed at black and Asian
minorities.
(b) If racial prejudice also has a significant cultural component,white Britons
will express more prejudice against Asians than blacks.
Social structural factors: education, class and gender
Three individual characteristics may also play an important role in attitudes
towards minorities: education, social class and gender. Previous work has
suggested that education, particularly higher education, encourages tolerant
attitudes on a range of dimensions (Sullivan, Piereson and Marcus 1982;
Sullivan and Transue 1999). More educated respondents are less likely to
perceive ethnic minorities as threatening and they are also less likely to hold
authoritarian values associated with racial prejudice (Hello, Scheepers and
Sleegers 2006). Educated respondents also pay more attention to the views

of political and media elites (Zaller 1992) and are therefore more likely to
adopt the elite norm against racial prejudice. As a result, prejudice levels are
likely to be lower among the highly educated. The second half of the twen-
tieth century saw large increases in spending on education in Britain.
Younger Britons are therefore much better qualified than their parents and
grandparents, which may contribute to generational declines in prejudice.
Ethnic minority immigrants to Britain have tended to concentrate in lower
status manual occupations. This is the result of the lower English language
proficiency and qualification levels of black and Asian immigrants, and the
prejudices of some British employers. If the perception that Britain's minori-
ties are an economic threat is an important source of hostility towards
minority groups (Bobo 1983) then such hostility is likely to be concentrated
in the lower social classes, with whom ethnic minorities have in the past
competed most directly for jobs and government welfare assistance. Hostility
may also be elevated among those who are directly dependent on govern-
ment assistance, such as the unemployed and those living in council housing,
who may also be concerned about competition for these resources from
minority groups.
There may also be a gender gap in racial prejudice. Some recent studies of
American racial prejudice have found higher levels of hostility to ethnic
minorities among men (Kuklinski, Cobb and Gilens 1997; Johnson and Marini
1998). Studies of the European radical right have also suggested that men are
over-represented among the support base for such parties, which focus promi-
nently on mobilizing xenophobic hostility to immigrants (Lubbers, Gijsberts
and Scheepers 2002; Norris 2005). Johnson and Marini (1998) suggest that this
effect could be the result of gender differences in socialized values: women are
socialized to be more `other oriented' than men.As a result they place greater
value on cooperation, interpersonal relationships and providing assistance to
those in difficulty ­ values which encourage more open and tolerant views
towards outgroups. This gender difference in racial attitudes has never been
quantitatively examined in a British context, but the socialized gender roles of
women and men are similar in Britain to those inAmerica,so we should expect
the effect to work similarly.
Hypothesis 4: (a) Prejudice levels will be lower among the highly qualified.
(b) The rapid rise in qualification levels between generations will contribute
to generational declines in prejudice
Hypothesis 5: Racial prejudice will be higher among those from lower status
manual occupations, those who are unemployed and those living in council
housing as they will perceive these groups as competitors for jobs and gov-
ernment assistance.
Hypothesis 6: Racial prejudice will be higher among men than among
women.

Data and methods
The data employed in this analysis comes from the British Social Attitudes
(BSA) surveys, a series of national surveys which have been carried out in
most years since 1983.5 The surveys used in this analysis were conducted
between 1983 and 1996, when a module of items on attitudes about immigra-
tion and ethnic minorities was repeated seven times. This analysis focuses on
two items dealing with how comfortable respondents feel about social contact
with ethnic minorities. They are worded as follows:
Ethnic minority boss:
(a) Do you think most white people in Britain would mind or not mind if a
suitably qualified person of black or West Indian/Asian origin were
appointed as their boss? (If mind) A lot or a little?
(b) And you personally? Would you mind or not mind? (If mind) A lot or
a little?
Ethnic minority spouse:
(a) Do you think that most white people in Britain would mind or not mind
if one of their close relatives were to marry a person of black or West
Indian/Asian6 origin? (If mind) A lot or a little?
(b) And you personally? Would you mind or not mind? (If mind) A lot or
a little?
The samples were randomly split so that half of white respondents were asked
about their views on blacks/West Indians and half were asked about Asians.
These racial categories ­ `black' and `Asian' ­ are rather crude and obscure a
great deal of potentially significant differences, for example between African
and Caribbean blacks, and between Muslim and Hindu Asians. Unfortunately,
British surveys have not regularly employed detailed ethnic categorizations,
so data are not available on attitudes towards these more disaggregated
minorities.The black and Asian categories, while crude, still allow us to broadly
gauge levels of hostility to racially distinct minorities, and to test Modood's
`double disadvantage' hypothesis.
These two social distance items are chosen for three reasons. Firstly, they
have been asked repeatedly over a 13 year run of data, allowing more detailed
analysis of the trends and distribution of racial attitudes than has hitherto been
undertaken. The only other racial prejudice measure available over a long
period in Britain is a question asking respondents to rate their own prejudice,
which was employed in two studies examining white racial attitudes (Evans
2002; Rothon and Heath 2003). This `self-rated prejudice' item is, however,
seriously flawed. While respondents who consider themselves prejudiced do
616 Robert Ford

hold distinctly more hostile attitudes towards ethnic minorities on a range of
other items, the conception of prejudice applied by respondents varies system-
atically with education and cohort: older cohorts and less educated respon-
dents express much greater hostility to ethnic minorities on other measures
while still rating themselves unprejudiced.7 As this analysis is concerned with
the change in attitudes over generations, and the effects of education on
expressed racial prejudice, these differences in the interpretation render this
item an unsuitable indicator.
The social distance measures employed here have a high level of theoretical
and empirical validity. Such items provide concrete examples of the kind of
irrational hostility towards a group that is considered to be the essence of
prejudice, but are also rooted in social situations that are easy for respondents
to comprehend. American studies have employed social distance items to
measure trends and patterns of racial prejudice for over seventy years and
have confirmed that these measures correlate closely with other racial atti-
tudes and measures of racial prejudice (Bogardus 1967; Firebaugh and Davis
1989; Kleg and Yamamoto 1998).
Evidence from the BSA surveys themselves provides further confirmation
that these measures are valid and substantively consequential. As Table I
shows, those who say they dislike social contact with ethnic minorities in the
workplace or the family are significantly less supportive of a range of policies
benefiting ethnic minorities. These differences in attitudes are largest when
the policies in question involve special provision of resources to minority
groups, such as aid to ethnic minority immigrants or special lessons for their
children.
The analysis begins by examining the trends in these social distance items
over time and the cohort structure of the attitudes, to test for generational
differences.Attitudes towards black and Asian minority groups are compared,
to see if there is any evidence of greater aversion to social contact with Asians
as a result of their greater cultural distinctiveness.
The second section conducts multivariate statistical analysis of the social
distance items. The third section introduces interaction terms to the models,
allowing the pattern of generational change in attitudes to vary across social
groups.
The responses to the social distance questions fall into three categories ­
`mind a lot',`mind a little', and `don't mind at all'.Although these answers have
a clear ordering, it is not obvious that the categories are equally distant from
each other. As such, linear regression of the responses is inappropriate. The
data are instead analysed using ordered logistic regression (Hoffman 2004:
ch.4; Long and Freese 2006: ch.5). Ordered logistic regression assumes that the
different response categories form part of a continuous unobserved variable,in
this case `aversion to social contact'. When the underlying level of hostility
passes a threshold, individuals' observed responses change from one category

to another.The ordered logit model estimates these threshold points from the
data, and presents them as a series of `cut point' coefficients, representing the
probability of a particular category occurring.8 The effects of independent
variables are assumed to operate equally on all categories, and are reported as
coefficients representing the effect of the independent variable on the likeli-
hood of any particular category occurring. These coefficients can then be
combined with the cut points to estimate the probability of each category
occurring for each value of an independent variable9. The raw coefficients
generated by ordered logistic regression models are not easy to interpret, so
the models are accompanied by tables and charts illustrating the effects of
particular variables on the probability of intolerant responses on the social
distance items.
The analysis examines period effects, the change in attitudes between
survey years and cohort effects, the change in attitudes between generations.
Respondents' attitudes could also, however, be affected by the ageing
process. Hostility towards outgroups is closely associated with authoritarian
values (Rowatt and Franklin 2004) which Altemeyer (1995) has argued
increase as people age, particularly after significant life cycle changes such as
marriage and having children. Older voters may also be more concerned
about perceived threats they associate with ethnic minorities, such as crime
and terrorism, which may encourage greater hostility. If such age differences
do exist, they should be separated from the effects of generational attitude
change. Thus the models should ideally include measures of age, period and
cohort simultaneously.
This task is complicated by the `identification problem': age, survey period
and birth cohort are logically linked, so that the effects of two are always
confounded (Mason and Fienberg 1985; Tilley 2002). Restricting assumptions
need to be made in order to estimate all three effects. Three different sets of
restricted models are estimated to address this problem. Firstly, period and
cohort effects are estimated with age effects restricted to the `social ageing'
factors found significant by Altemeyer in relation to authoritarian values
(Altemeyer 1995): marital status and the presence of children in the
household. Secondly, cohort and age effects are estimated with period effects
restricted to zero. Thirdly, age and period effects are estimated with cohort
effects restricted to four wide time bands. The reported effects of age, period
and cohort were robust across these different specifications, so only the results
from the first specification are presented.
The effect of education is tested using dummies for possession of a degree,
A-levels and GCSEs/O-Levels, with the unqualified as a reference group. Class
is measured using a 5 category Goldthorpe-Heath classification, with the
working class as a reference group. Controls for religious observance are also
included, with dummies for self-identified denomination and regularity of
church attendance. Gender is measured using a dummy for men.

Results
The trends in social distance attitudes over the period from 1983­96 are
plotted in Figure I. The solid lines indicate the total proportion of respon-
dents expressing opposition to each form of social contact, while the dashed
lines show the proportion who express strong opposition. Significant hostility
to contact with ethnic minority exists in the white British population.
Between 10 and 20 per cent of British survey respondents object to an ethnic
minority boss, and between 30 and 50 per cent object to a close relative
marrying someone black or Asian. Around half of these respondents register
strong objections.
As hypothesized, both measures of racial prejudice decline markedly over
the period under examination, particularly in the 1990s. Levels of overall
opposition to both forms of social contact nearly halve after 1989, with levels
of strong opposition falling even more steeply.There is little evidence of higher
prejudice against Asians. Respondents do express higher opposition to
working for an Asian employer throughout the series, but the difference in
attitudes is small. Attitudes to racial inter-marriage are almost identical for
both groups in every survey.
Figure II shows how levels of racial prejudice break down by birth
cohort, using data from all the survey years combined.10 There are large gen-
erational differences in prejudice levels, with the proportion of respondents
giving discriminatory responses falls steeply between cohorts on all four
items. The decline is linear for hostility to a black or Asian employer, but
non-linear for attitudes to racial inter-marriage. Hostility to relatives taking
a black or Asian spouse is fairly uniform among the oldest generations, then
falls rapidly among cohorts born after the mid-1930s. This pattern of genera-
tional change suggests prejudice may be a value-type attitude, primarily
influenced by conditions in youth. Generations brought up in an ethnically
homogenous Britain express high levels of prejudice, while those who have
come up since mass migration began express progressively more tolerant
attitudes.
The generational declines in racial prejudices are very steep. Opposition to
working for a black or Asian boss falls by half from 30 per cent in the pre-1920
cohorts to 15 per cent in the cohorts from the 1970s. Strong opposition falls
from 15 per cent to nearly zero. Opposition to racial intermarriage falls even
further, from over 60 per cent in the oldest cohorts to under 20 per cent in the
youngest, with strong opposition falling from 40 to 10 per cent. There is again
little evidence of elevated hostility towards Asians. The only notable diver-
gence in attitudes actually runs in the other direction: the oldest cohorts
express rather more opposition to working under a black boss and are
more likely to strongly oppose white­black intermarriage than white­Asian
intermarriage.

Multivariate analysis
Initial analysis thus suggests a declining trend in prejudice which is being
driven by generational change. Table II shows results of ordered logistic
regression analyses, which test the influence of a wider range of factors on
racial prejudice. Figure III plots the effects of the main significant variables in
the ethnic spouse models, showing how each variable changes the proportion
of respondents opposing racial intermarriage. All the other variables in the
model are held constant at their means. The grey bars show the proportions

expressing prejudice against Asians, the black bar the proportion expressing
prejudice against blacks. The figures employ different scales to make presen-
tation of the effects as clear as possible.
There is a significant period effect in all the models.A sharp shift in attitudes
occurs between the surveys from the 1980s and 1990s, with racial prejudice 5 to
10 percentage points lower in the 1990s surveys than in those conducted in the
1980s.11 There is little evidence that this change is a methodological artefact.
Question wordings, question orderings, and the placement of these questions
in the overall survey were not changed between the surveys from the 1980s and
1990s.12 Several factors may be contributing to this sharp decline in racial
prejudices in the 1990s. The political environment may have become more
tolerant, as the divisive Margaret Thatcher, who had made several controver-
sial statements on race and immigration issues in 1990s, was replaced in 1990
by the more conciliatory John Major. The main social development of the
period was a deep economic recession in 1990­1,which may have increased the
salience of economic over social issues in most white respondents' minds. We
might also expect that the controversy over the Satanic Verses in 1989 and
Britain's participation in the first Gulf War, fought against a Muslim nation,
may have increased the salience of religious divisions over racial ones
(Modood 1990).The period change in attitudes is somewhat larger for views of
blacks than it is for attitudes to Asians, but unfortunately no data are available
on attitudes towards Muslims specifically that might enable closer examination
of this question.
While prejudice does shift significantly downwards in surveys from the 1990s,
the most important predictor of hostility to minorities in all the models is birth
cohort.13 Younger generations consistently show much less hostility to social
contact with black and Asian Britons. This cohort effect is nonlinear for the
spouse item, with a significant widening of the generation gap in attitudes for
cohorts born after the 1930s.14 Predicted opposition to racial intermarriage falls
from over 60 per cent in the 1910 cohort to around 25 per cent in the 1970 cohort.
The proportion strongly objecting falls from over one third to around one tenth.
Cohort also has the largest impact on attitudes to a black employer, with
opposition levels falling from over a quarter of the 1910 cohort to under a tenth
of the 1970 cohort. Generational shifts in attitudes to an Asian employer are
smaller, though they remain the second largest effect in the model: opposition
falls 7 percentage points between these cohorts,from 20 per cent to 13 per cent.
There is little evidence that life cycle changes or ageing processes are
responsible for these cohort differences. Social ageing events such as marriage
and family formation have little impact on prejudice. Only those who are
single show any difference in attitudes, and these effects are only marginally
significant. Models including a continuous age term and a restricted cohort
term did not fit the data as well as the reported models. The size, significance
and robustness of these cohort effects suggest that racial prejudices are indeed

value-type attitudes: older generations have adopted the discriminatory views
about race which were prevalent when they grew up and retained them despite
their declining legitimacy and social unacceptability.
The level and social distribution of prejudices against black and Asian
Britons are very similar, suggesting that Gilroy and his colleagues may be right
to argue that visible racial differences are the most important factor driving
white reactions.The models do suggest some differential discrimination among
the oldest generations, but in the opposite direction to that expected by
Modood. Britons born in the 1930s or earlier tend to express more hostility
towards blacks than Asians on both items, with prejudice against blacks 5 to 10
percentage points higher than prejudice against Asians. This difference is
perhaps the result of more hostile stereotypes about the backwardness of
black cultures formed in the colonial era. Black prejudice declines more
rapidly between generations, eliminating this differential discrimination com-
pletely among the post-WWII cohorts.
As hypothesized, highly educated individuals express significantly less
prejudice on all items, with prejudice levels among degree holders between 5
and 15 percentage points lower than among the unqualified. The rapid rise in
qualification levels does not, however, account for much of the generational
shift in attitudes: the cohort effects are little altered by the introduction of
controls for education.There is a significant difference in how racial intermar-
riage is regarded by degree holders and the uneducated. Those with degrees
express greater opposition to white­black intermarriage, with opposition
levels 8 percentage points higher than to white­Asian intermarriage, while the
uneducated regard both groups similarly on this item.This difference is due to
the greater hostility shown to black­white intermarriage by older white degree
holders and will be discussed in greater detail in the next section.
Contrary to expectations, there is no evidence of elevated hostility to black
and Asian minorities among the working classes or those dependent on state
resources. The main effects of class are limited to one group: the salariat
consistently express significantly less prejudice than the other social classes.
Those in salariat occupations are more tolerant of their relatives taking a black
or Asian spouse, and of working for an Asian employer. Professional workers
in the salariat have the most secure and high status jobs in the economy,so they
are perhaps less worried about competition from ethnic minorities who tend to
be concentrated in lower status professions. Professional workers are also
more likely to work for large multinational firms that operate in and recruit
from many countries. Globally mobile professional workers are more likely to
have experience working in different countries, or dealing with foreign col-
leagues or customers, which may encourage them to develop a more cosmo-
politan outlook towards minority groups.
Men are more hostile to an ethnic minority employer, particularly an Asian
boss, but no gender difference is found in attitudes towards ethnic minority

spouses. However, looking only at the main effects of gender understates the
importance of gender divides in racial attitudes, as further analysis reveals
differing patterns of generational attitude change for men and women. Cohort
effects also depend on education and social class.These interaction effects are
discussed in the next section.
Religious identity and church attendance also have significant effects on
social distance attitudes.The substantive impact of these variables is relatively
small and so they are not shown in Figure III. Identification with the Church of
England encourages somewhat elevated levels of hostility to minorities, par-
ticularly towards Asians who are predominantly non-Christian. Actually
attending church, however, has the opposite effect: those who attend once a
month or more have significantly lower social distance on both items. Those
who attend church regularly may be internalizing the tolerant norms of Chris-
tian doctrine, or may at least feel a greater need to appear more tolerant
towards minorities in their public attitudes, perhaps due to greater awareness
of the social norm against racial prejudice.
Interaction effects: diverging attitudes among the young
The second set of models shown in Table III adds interaction effects between
cohort and social characteristics, enabling the pattern of generational change
to vary for different social groups.15 These interactions significantly improve
the fit of the models, suggesting important variations in the pattern of genera-
tional change between social groups. The main effect of cohort remains sig-
nificant in three of the four models, suggesting that a general generational
decline in prejudice occurs in these cases. Cohort has no significant main effect
on attitudes towards an Asian boss suggesting no general pattern of genera-
tional change in attitudes on this item.The main period and cohort effects are
larger for attitudes towards blacks. The gender interaction term is also larger
for attitudes towards blacks, suggesting more divergent patterns of genera-
tional change in attitudes towards blacks than in attitudes towards Asians.
Larger generational shifts are seen among the salariat and women in all four
models. In the ethnic spouse models, significantly larger generational shifts are
also found among those with degrees or A-level qualifications.
The meaning of these different patterns of change is illustrated in Table IV,
which shows the pattern of generational change in hostility to racial intermar-
riage for different social groups.16 The generational interactions fall into two
different patterns. The first is divergence from similar starting points, seen in
the education and class interactions. Levels of prejudice start off similarly for
all groups and then begin to diverge for cohorts born in the 1930s and after
who came of age after mass black and Asian immigration to Britain had
commenced.This pattern of divergence fits with the idea that the educated and

privileged are more responsive to the various social pressures encouraging the
adopting of tolerant views.The generational shift in these groups began earlier
and has progressed further than among the uneducated and the working
classes, though evidence from the youngest cohorts suggests that they too are
now adopting more tolerant views of minorities.
The interactions between generation and gender follow a different pattern.
Women start with higher levels of prejudice which decline rapidly while male
prejudices barely change at all.As a result, a gender gap is seen in attitudes to
racial intermarriage among pre-immigration cohorts which is then reversed
among the youngest cohorts. Female hostility to an Asian spouse declines by

25 percentage points between the 1910 and 1970 cohort, and opposition to a
black spouse falls by 38 points. Male hostility levels fall by 7 and 13 points
respectively, and show no change at all between the 1910 and 1950 cohorts.The
difference between growing female tolerance and more persistent male hos-
tility is just as pronounced in attitudes to an ethnic minority boss.This pattern
suggests that women are more responsive to prevalent social norms about
race.Women brought up when prejudice was socially acceptable express more
prejudice than men, while the youngest generations have more rapidly
adopted a tolerant view of ethnic minorities.
These interaction effects show that while racial prejudice is relatively evenly
distributed among older Britons, among the young it has remained prevalent
in some social groups and virtually disappeared in others. This social diver-
gence can be most clearly illustrated using combined social categories, as is
shown in Figure IV.This compares levels of prejudice among graduate women
with degrees with those of men with no qualifications. These are large social

groups ­ women with degrees constitute 5 per cent of the total sample (and 8
per cent of those born after 1960), men with no qualifications 28 per cent.
There is a dramatic difference in the generational structure of the two groups'
attitudes. Opposition to racial intermarriage among degree holding women
falls from over 60 per cent among the oldest cohorts to under 10 per cent
among the youngest, while unqualified male opposition remains flat at around
50 per cent for most generations, only beginning to decline among the very
youngest cohorts.
Discussion
The evidence from this analysis suggests that a large and growing segment of
Britain's white population is at ease with racial diversity. Opposition to contact
with black and Asian minorities in both family and workplace was markedly
lower in the mid-1990s than it was in the early 1980s. A major generational
shift in white attitudes towards ethnic minorities is the most important driver
of this trend. Older generations who grew up in an ethnically homogeneous
Britain before mass immigration began are much more hostile about social
contact with minority groups than their children and grandchildren. Racial
prejudices thus resemble core political and social values (Inglehart 1997; Tilley
2005): they are strongly structured by generation and seem to be primarily
influenced by the social conditions prevalent during an individual's youth.

While considerable evidence was found for a decline in discrimination based
on colour, little evidence was found to support the contention that race-based
discrimination is being replaced by new barriers based on perceived cultural
difference. British respondents did not express greater hostility towards Asian
minority groups, despite their greater cultural and religious distinctiveness.
There is a larger generational shift in attitudes towards black Britons, but this
is because they are regarded with greater hostility by older cohorts, not
because they enjoy greater acceptance from the young.While the groups asked
about here are rather simplified racial categories, they provide some evidence
to support the contention from Gilroy and others that racial difference
remains more salient than cultural difference as a source of prejudice. Further
research is needed to investigate whether this finding is robust when more
carefully defined groups, particularly groups defined by religion, are asked
about.
How does Britain's growing acceptance of ethnic minorities compare with
attitudes in other rapidly diversifying developed nations? Research examining
trends in attitudes to immigrant minorities in Europe has been relatively
limited, but recent studies have found significantly lower hostility to immigrant
minorities among younger cohorts in a range of immigrant receiving West
European nations (Pettigrew and Meertens 1995; Gijsberts, Hagendoorn and
Scheepers 2004). These findings suggest that the generational shift towards
more tolerance of diversity in Britain may be part of a general trend in
diversifying European democracies, although research in Holland suggests
that deteriorating economic conditions and high immigration rates can halt
or reverse such shifts (Coenders and Scheepers 1998). More comparative
research is needed to examine the extent of this general trend and how it is
affected by conditions within individual nations.
Trends in racial attitudes have been also been extensively researched in
America, where scholars have also found evidence for a similar generational
shift in attitudes towards ethnic minorities. While America has been racially
diverse since its foundation, black Americans only gained full acceptance to
the American political community following the Civil Rights reforms of the
mid-1960s.As in Britain, white American attitudes towards African Americans
are strongly influenced by conditions in a respondent's youth, with sustained
declines in many measures of prejudice against blacks among those coming of
age after the Civil Rights era (Firebaugh and Davis 1989; Kinder and Sanders
1996). Studies examining social distance from a range of minority groups over
a seventy year period have also found sustained falls in the hostility white
Americans express towards social contact with minority groups (Kleg and
Yamamoto 1998). The relative ranking of groups has remained the same over
time, but the difference in attitudes between most and least liked groups has
declined as hostility to contact with the least favoured groups has declined
most rapidly.
Is racial prejudice declining in Britain? 631

Evidence of persistent discrimination against African Americans despite the
apparent survey evidence of a sharp decline in prejudice in post-Civil Rights
America has lead some American scholars to question whether the survey
evidence is capturing a real shift in attitudes. Proponents of `new' or `symbolic'
prejudice theories have contended that the apparent decline in American
racial prejudice actually reflects a growing reluctance to express in public
racial prejudices which are no longer considered socially acceptable, while
private racial prejudices remain widespread and continue to motive discrimi-
natory behaviour and attitudes (Bobo 2001; Sears and Henry 2003). These
scholars point to evidence from more subtle survey measures which suggest
continuing opposition to providing assistance to African Americans (Gilens
1999), persistent negative stereotypes about blacks (Bobo 2001) and evidence
that survey respondents express elevated prejudice when they believe they can
do so anonymously (Kuklinski, Cobb and Gilens 1997).
The `new prejudice' arguments have been intensely debated in America
(Quillian 2006 provides an excellent summary), but they provide cause for
caution in interpreting the declining trend in British prejudice. The social
distance items employed here are similar to the `blatant prejudice' measures
which new racism scholars argue no longer accurately capture racial attitudes
in America.There is therefore a risk that part of the trend seen in this analysis
actually reflects a generational shift in the social acceptability of admitting to
racial prejudice. However, we can draw some confidence from the fact that
rising British acceptance of ethnic minorities is also reflected in the prefer-
ences revealed in the housing and marriage markets: Britain's ethnic minori-
ties are becoming less residentially segregated from the white population,
(Simpson 2007) and rates of intermarriage between whites and all minority
groups have risen rapidly (Coleman 1985; Muttarak 2004).17
While the indicators employed may not be perfectly reliable, the shifts in
attitudes examined here thus seem to reflect a genuine increase in the social
acceptance of British ethnic minorities. The generational basis to the trend
mean it is also likely to have continued beyond the end of the survey series
examined here, as younger and more tolerant cohorts replace the ageing and
highly prejudiced pre-immigration cohorts.18 While prejudice is therefore
likely to be less of a problem in the future, it is unlikely to disappear overnight.
Cohort replacement is a slow process, and significant levels of hostility to
ethnic minorities remain even in the youngest cohorts surveyed here. The
generational decline in racial prejudices is also not evenly spread. Genera-
tional shifts in attitudes have been most rapid among highly educated Britons,
those in high status occupations and among women. Younger generations of
these groups seem to have been completely socialized into a tolerant set of
`multicultural' norms, and rarely express any discomfort about social contact
with ethnic minorities. By contrast, significant pools of hostility to ethnic
minorities remain among less qualified, working-class young men. Researchers

and policymakers interested in understanding and combating prejudice should
focus on these groups, and particularly on examining how exactly education
encourages more tolerant attitudes, and on why British racial prejudice is
becoming an increasingly male phenomenon among the young.

Notes
1. This research was generously sup-
ported by an Economic and Social Research
Council doctoral studentship award. I would
like to thank Steve Fisher, Maria Sobo-
lewska, Anthony Heath, Geoff Evans, Jane
Green, Armen Hakhverdian, participants
at the American Sociological Association
annual conference and the Aage Sorenson
memorial conference, and the anonymous
reviewers for their helpful and insightful
comments on earlier drafts of this work. As
usual, responsibility for remaining errors lies
with the author alone.
2. The measure they employed asks
respondents to rate their own racial preju-
dice, without providing any explanation
of `prejudice'. Respondents interpret this
abstract term in very different ways, render-
ing the measure unreliable.
3. In America, the demise of the `Jim
Crow' regime of segregation and black
political disenfranchisement has been
accompanied by a sharp decrease in racial
prejudice, in both segregated and integrated
states (Firebaugh and Davis 1989; Bobo,
2001).
4. Immigration settlements from the pre-
dominantly black and Asian `New Common-
wealth' fell 30% from an average of 54,000
in the three years prior to Thatcher's elec-
tion to an average of 38,000 during the
first Thatcher administration. Settlements
remained stable thereafter at around
30­35,000 until the late 1990s, when they
began to rise again.
5. The British Social Attitudes surveys
are conducted by the National Centre for
Social Research. I thank the UK data
archive at the University of Essex for
making this data available. The data can be
accessed at their website: www.data-archive.
ac.uk. Full technical details of the British
Social Attitudes surveys are available at this
site, or in the annually published British
Social Attitudes reports.
6. For both items, the sample is randomly
split and half of the respondents are asked
about `blacks or West Indians' and half
asked about `Asians'.
7. For example, respondents from older
cohorts who consider themselves `unpreju-
diced' express much higher rates of opposi-
tion to race relations legislation, ethnic
minority immigration and assistance to
ethnic minorities than `unprejudiced' people
in younger cohorts. This pattern suggests a
generational shift in the standards of racial
tolerance, with younger generations being
stricter when they rate their own prejudice.
8. Technically, the log odds of a particular
category occurring, but it is straightforward
to derive the probability from this figure.
9. The ordered logit model makes an
important `proportional odds' assumption
which prevents the slopes from varying
between different categories. The validity of
this assumption was tested by comparing
the results with a multinomial logit model,
which does not assume constant slopes. The
model fit and results were very similar.
10. The chart shows a seven year moving
average of attitudes,to smooth out the varia-
tions between individual years.
11. Model fit was not improved by mea-
suring the period effect for each survey year
individually. The effect appears to be a shift
which occurred between the surveys from
the 1980s and the surveys from the 1990s.
Is racial prejudice declining in Britain? 633

12. There was one change made in 1994.
The social distance questions always appear
at the end of a battery of questions about
racism in British society, immediately after
a question about support for anti-
discrimination legislation. In 1994, three
questions were asked about anti-
discrimination legislation rather than one.
This may have encouraged respondents to
think of discriminatory attitudes towards
minorities as socially unacceptable, and
reduced admissions of prejudice. However,
the responses in the 1994 survey were not
significantly different from those in 1996,
when only one questions was asked about
anti-discrimination law.
13. Cohort is measured using a centred
year of birth variable, so the coefficients in
the model represent the effect of changing
the year of birth by one year.
14. Analysis of this nonlinearity using a
non-parametric smoothed regression (Fox
2000) suggests attitudes on this item are
roughly constant among generations born
before 1935, and become continuously more
liberal among generations born later.
15. Interactions between gender and
other social characteristics, and period and
other social characteristics were also tested
but were not found to be significant and
were dropped from the final model. Non-
linear interactions between the squared
cohort term and social characteristics were
also tested, and found to be insignificant.
16. Calculated using the Stata pro-
gramme Clarify (Tomz, Wittenberg and
King 2001). Levels of all other variables are
set to population means.
17. By contrast, rates of black­white
intermarriage remain low in America (Qian
1997) and black and white communities
remain highly geographically segregated.
18. The only social distance item asked
since 1996 ­ an item which asked if respon-
dents were troubled by the idea of a relative
marrying a Muslim, asked in 2003 ­ supports
this argument.The level of opposition ­ 27%
­ was considerably lower than the 1996
figure for black and Asian minorities (35%).
This low level of hostility is notable given
that we might expect particularly high levels
of hostility towards Muslims in a survey con-
ducted less than two years after the Septem-
ber 11th terrorist attacks.
