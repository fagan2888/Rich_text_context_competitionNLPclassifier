Introduction
The Bahraini people consist of an Arabian Peninsula popula-
tion with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
which occurs among 20­30% of the adults.1 This raises the
involvement of genetic risk factors with the disease and the
development of one or more of its long-term complications
including cardiomyopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy and neu-
ropathy. We have observed that some patients develop one or
more of the diabetes-induced complications despite the short
duration of their disease whereas others may have had the dis-
ease for 10 or more years without any of these complications.2
These initial observations prompted us to investigate whether
genetic risk factors may play a role in the development of
T2DM or subsequently acquiring any related complications.
Both of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and meth-
ylene-tetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) enzymes have
been previously suggested as potential candidate genes for the
pathogenesis of T2DM and its complications in addition to the
development of cardiovascular diseases.3­6

Abstract
Introduction: Bahrain has a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Previously, Angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism was found to be associated with T2DM in Bahrainis. The rela-
tionship between the disease progression in Bahraini T2DM population and the genetic polymorphism of methylene-
tetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) C677T is still under investigation.
Aim: The current study investigated the distribution of MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism among Bahraini T2DM
patients and examined the interaction between ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms on the risk of developing
T2DM and its long-term complications.
Materials and methods: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
were used to test for the presence of ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms in 171 patients with T2DM compared
to 188 healthy (non-diabetic) age-matched control subjects from Bahrain.
Results: The incidence of the DD genotype and D allele of the ACE gene was high among Bahraini T2DM patients.
MTHFR allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between patients and controls. No significant relationship was
identified between the combinations of ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms with T2DM.
Conclusions: The results clearly showed an association of the ACE I/D polymorphism with the progression of T2DM,
but when it interacts with MTHFR polymorphism no influence was detected on the increased risk of T2DM.

The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE
gene was the first candidate gene of the renin­angiotensin
system (RAS) for a predisposition to diabetic nephropathy.7
The gene was discovered and described in 1990 by Rigat et
al.8 and was shown to account for about half of the pheno-
typic variance of serum ACE concentrations in the normal
population.8 The human ACE gene is located on the long
arm of chromosome 17 (17q23) and includes 26 exons and
25 introns. The polymorphism is characterized by the pres-
ence (insertion) or absence (deletion) of a 287-bp Alu1 ele-
ment inside intron 16 of the ACE gene, producing three
genotypes (DD, II and ID heterozygote).8,9 The highest
serum ACE activity was seen in the DD genotype while the
lowest was seen in the II genotype.8 In addition to its role in
a predisposition to diabetic nephropathy, the ACE polymor-
phism has been suggested as associated with such diabetic
complications10 as coronary heart disease,11,12 stroke13 and
hypertension.14,15 Earlier studies have also demonstrated an
ethnic variation in the frequency of I/D polymorphism in
relation to diabetic nephropathy.7,10,16,17
Frosst et al.18 identified a C-to-T substitution at nucleo-
tide 677 that converts an alanine to a valine residue which
is responsible for the synthesis of a thermo-labile form of
MTHFR, a key enzyme in homocysteine metabolism.
Individuals with homozygosity for the T allele are predis-
posed to the development of hyperhomocysteinemia, espe-
cially with a low level of plasma folate.19 However, the
relationship between MTHFR polymorphisms and hyper-
homocysteinemia has not been well established yet,
although C677T polymorphisms of MTHFR variants have
been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular dis-
eases including hypertension.18
The association of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism
with Bahraini T2DM was published in 20112 followed by
another study20 in 2012. Collectively, the initial results
showed that the frequencies of D allele and DD genotypes
were high among the general Bahraini population.20
Moreover, there is a strong association of D allele and DD
genotypes with the high prevalence of T2DM,2 these initial
observations are in total agreement with most reports from
other populations, yet not shown to be a risk factor for the
development of T2DM.2 Meanwhile, the relationship
between the disease progression in Bahraini T2DM popula-
tion and the genetic polymorphism of MTHFR C677T is
still under investigation.
Therefore, the aim of the current study was to test the distri-
bution of MTHFR C677Tgene polymorphism among Bahraini
T2DM patients and to examine the interaction between ACE
I/D and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms on the risk of devel-
opment of T2DM and its long-term complications.
Materials and methods
Subjects
This case-control association study recruited a total of 171
unrelated adults amongst Bahraini T2DM patients and 188
age-matched, healthy control non-diabetic Bahraini adults.
The project had the relevant ethnical clearance from the
Ethics Committee of Arabian Gulf University and other
related institutions to undertake the study.
DNA extraction
Venous blood was collected by venipuncture both from
overnight fasting T2DM patients and healthy controls in
vacutainer tubes with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid
(EDTA) as anticoagulant. Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells were used as a source of genomic DNA. Extraction of
DNA was accomplished according to the protocol of the
QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Spin Column (QiageGmbH,
D-40724 Hilden, Germany).
ACE I/D polymorphism genotyping
Genotyping was performed on extracted DNA by the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a pair of oligonucleo-
tide primers: 50-CTGGAGACCACTCCCATCCTTTCT-30
and 50-GATGTGGCCATCACGTCAGAT-30 (Biobasic,
Markham, Canada). The reactions were performed with 5
pmol of each primer in combination with Taq PCR Master
Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA). PCR was used to
detect two alleles of the 190 bp deletion (D allele) and 490 bp
insertion (I allele) fragments. DNA was amplified using
primer and PCR cycling conditions as described earlier.21
Each sample that had the DD genotype was re-amplified with
an insertion-specific primer pair, which recognized an inser-
tion-specific sequence.22,23 The PCR products was analyzed
on 2% agarose gels after staining with TMVistra Green.
MTHFR C677T genotyping
The single point mutation in the gene that codes for MTHFR
C677T had been analyzed by PCR­restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) assay as described by Frosst
et al.18 The regions containing the 677 base of MTHFR
were amplified by PCR using a sense primer
(5-TGAAGGAGAAGGTGTCTGCGG GA-3) and an
antisenseprimer(5-AGGACGGTGCGGTGAGAGTC-3).
The presence or absence of mutation depended on the
restriction enzymes to recognize the restriction sequence
and then cut it into two bands which were analyzed on 2%
agarose gels after staining with TMVistra Green.
Statistical analysis
The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies between
patients and controls was determined by allele counting and
the statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version
20 statistical package for Windows, which also computed
the p value, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI). The distribution of alleles and genotypes between
patients and controls was determined using the
174 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)
goodness-of-fit test, and statistical significance was deter-
mined at p<0.05.
Results
Study groups
Table 1 shows the general characteristics of the study par-
ticipants including number, gender, age, duration of diabe-
tes, body mass index and diabetes-induced long-term
complications in both T2DM and control groups. Data are
represented as mean±standard deviation (SD). In this study,
patients were all diagnosed as T2DM and this was based on
the World Health Organization diagnostic and classifica-
tion criteria of 1998.24 The criteria for inclusion of T2DM
patients included insulin resistance (obesity, hyper-
insulinemia and hyperglycemia). None of the patients had
ever had keto-acidosis. The unrelated adult Bahraini T2DM
patients (n=171) comprised of 85 (52.1%) males and 78
(47.9%) females with a mean age (±SD) of 53±10.00 years
(Table 1). These patients also had a high incidence of dia-
betes-induced long-term complications. The control group
(n=188) comprised of 72 (58.1%) males and 52 (41.1%)
females with a mean age (±SD) of 55±10.00 years.
Moreover, the diabetic patients had the disease for over 11
years. Both groups were obese.
The genotype frequencies of I/D polymorphism of
the ACE gene inT2DM patients compared to
control subjects
The genotype and allele distribution of the ACE I/D poly-
morphism in T2DM patients (n=171) and control subjects
(n=188) are shown in Table 2. The frequencies of the II, ID,
and DD genotypes of the ACE gene in control subjects
were 18.1%, 47.3% and 34.6%, respectively, and in T2DM
patients were 12.8%, 39.2% and 48%, respectively. Both
groups were tested for the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
(HWE) at the ACE I/D locus by Chi square (²) test with
one degree of freedom. The frequency of DD genotypes
was significantly higher in T2DM patients than in control
subjects (p=0.01, OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.14­2.67). In addi-
tion, the frequency of the D allele was significantly higher
among patients than control subjects (p=0.01, OR=1.49,
95% CI=1.01­2.25).

combination.
Discussion
In view of the high incidence of T2DM among Bahrainis,1
the present case­control association study was undertaken
for the first time to investigate the distribution of ACE I/D
gene polymorphism together with MTHFR C677T gene
polymorphism in this population. At the beginning, this
study compared the allele and genotype frequencies of both
polymorphisms separately in Bahrain's T2DM patients
compared with age-matched non diabetic controls. The

176 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)
results of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism showed high
frequencies of the D allele and DD genotypes among
T2DM patients. In contrast, MTHFR C677T gene polymor-
phism was negatively associated with T2DM. In addition,
the data for gene combination with the ACE I/D polymor-
phism did not show any significant correlations with the
development of T2DM among Bahraini patients.
The Bahraini population is an Arabian Peninsula popula-
tion. The characteristics of Arabic populations make them
ideal for the study of complex, polygenic, multifactorial disor-
ders such as T2DM. The Arabic populations are characterized
by genetic homogeneity due to the tribal structure of their soci-
ety, large family size and extensive consanguinity1,2 which
indicates the need to increase the number of the samples.
In relation to ACE gene polymorphism and its associa-
tion with T2DM and its long-term complications in the
Bahraini people, we reported earlier that there was a high
level of the D allele and DD genotypes of the ACE I/D gene
among the general Bahraini population.20 In turn, this may
explain the highest prevalence of T2DM and its complica-
tions in addition to hypertension in Bahraini population.1
The mode of action of the ACE I/D gene was not known
until now, however, earlier reports showed that D allele is
associated with higher plasma ACE concentrations.9,21
Similarly, other studies have now shown that patients with
the DD genotype can develop cellular hypertrophy, prolif-
eration and disruption of the extracellular matrix and
secrete cytokine and growth factors. Collectively, these ini-
tial data suggest that ACE I/D polymorphism is a candidate
gene for increasing the incidence, pathogenesis and pro-
gression of several diseases including cardiomyopathy,25
hypertension26 and T2DM with its long-term macro and
micro vascular complications27 including diabetic nephrop-
athy.28 This is further supported by data in this and earlier
studies confirming the association of D allele and DD gen-
otypes with the risk of development T2DM.2 Moreover,
these observations are also in close agreement with other
population studies confirming the association of ACE I/D
polymorphismandincreasedriskofdevelopingT2DM.3,29,30
Although the current study did not show any effect of
the MTHFR gene and its combination with ACE I/D gene
in the progression of T2DM in Bahrainis, further investiga-
tion is required to support the current study. Yet, the rela-
tionship between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and
its exact action with T2DM worldwide is under question.
Several previous studies have shown no association
between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and T2DM
among Taiwanese,31 Tunisian,3,32 Brazilian,33 German34 and
Czech populations.35 In contrast, other data have indicated
a significant association with T2DM among Moroccan,36
Chinese37 and Polish38 populations with the possibility of
increased risks of cardiovascular disease and hyperten-
sion.39 In addition, ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T polymor-
phisms in combination have been reported to increase the
risk of developing T2DM in the Tunisian populations3 who
suffer from ischemic stroke6 and pregnancy-induced hyper-
tension.40 However, neither the ACE I/D nor the C677T
MTHFR polymorphism was reported to be associated with
risk of myocardial infarction in the Polish population.38
In conclusion, the present data confirmed the significant
association of T2DM with ACE I/D polymorphism but no
significant association with MTHFR C677T. Furthermore,
no influence was detected on the progression of diabetes
when both polymorphisms were combined.
