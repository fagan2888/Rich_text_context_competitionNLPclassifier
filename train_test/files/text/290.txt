Modest Wine Drinking and Decreased Prevalence of
Suspected Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
Winston Dunn,1 Ronghui Xu,2 and Jeffrey B. Schwimmer3
People at risk for coronary heart disease are often at risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD). The association of modest wine consumption with NAFLD has not been studied and
the recommendation of wine for patients at risk for both diseases is controversial. The aim is to
test the hypothesis that modest wine consumption is associated with decreased prevalence of
NAFLD. We included Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants
who either reported no alcohol consumption or preferentially drinking wine with total alcohol
consumption up to 10 g per day. Suspected NAFLD was based on unexplained serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) elevation over the cut point of the reference laboratory (ALT > 43) and
the cut point based on the 95th percentile of healthy subjects (ALT > 30 for men; ALT > 19 for
women). Multivariate analysis was adjusted for age, gender, race, neighborhood, income, edu-
cation, caffeine intake, and physical activity. A total of 7,211 nondrinkers and 945 modest wine
drinkers comprised the study sample. Based on the reference laboratory cut point, suspected
NAFLD was observed in 3.2% of nondrinkers and 0.4% of modest wine drinkers. The adjusted
odds ratio was 0.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.49). Using the healthy subject cut point,
suspected NAFLD was observed in 14.3% of nondrinkers and 8.6% of wine drinkers. The
adjusted odds ratio was 0.51 (95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.79). Conclusion: Modest wine
consumption is associated with reduced prevalence of suspected NAFLD. The current study
supports the safety of one glass of wine per day for cardioprotection in patients at risk for both
coronary heart disease and NAFLD. (HEPATOLOGY 2008;47:1947-1954.)
The beneficial effects of wine and wine-derived
chemicals have received a great deal of recent
attention. Moderate wine consumption has
been associated with reduced risk of coronary heart
disease (CHD).1 Therefore, some physicians recom-
mend moderate wine consumption to patients with
adverse cardiovascular risk factors.2 However, these are
the same individuals at increased risk for developing
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).3,4 NAFLD
is closely related to metabolic syndrome and therefore
shares many risk factors with CHD. Although the
threshold for alcoholic liver disease is thought to be
ingestion of 20 g to 30 g of alcohol per day for men and
10 g to 30 g of alcohol per day for women,5,6 the
threshold may be lower for overweight subjects who are
at risk for both CHD and NAFLD.7 The threshold for
patients with pre-existing liver disease is unclear. The
usual recommendation for patients with NAFLD is to
strictly avoid alcohol. Despite the potential for liver
injury, there is indirect evidence to suggest that modest
wine and alcohol may by protective against liver injury.
In an animal model, the wine polyphenol, resveratrol,
reduces steatosis in mice fed with a high calorie diet.8
Wine ameliorates many risk factors common to
NAFLD and CHD such as insulin resistance and dys-
lipidemia.9-11 These studies raise the possibility that
wine may actually be protective against NAFLD. In the
absence of concrete evidence, any recommendation re-
garding wine consumption in people at risk for both
CHD and NAFLD remains controversial. Therefore,

the current study aimed to test the hypothesis that
modest wine consumption is associated with a de-
creased prevalence of NAFLD.
Patients and Methods
Study Sample. Subjects were participants in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III). NHANES III was a cross-sectional
study conducted in the United States from 1988 to 1994.
The study used a stratified, multistage, probability cluster
sampling design to obtain a representative sample of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized population.12 This study
was approved by the institutional review board of The
University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.
We included participants age 21 years and older, eth-
nically white, black, or Mexican American. Although
fatty liver is common in older teenagers,13 we chose a
minimum age of 21 years because it is the legal drinking
age in the United States. We included participants who
either reported no alcohol consumption during the past
month, or reported drinking wine, beer, or liquor up to
one alcoholic beverage per day. We did not include higher
level of alcohol consumption because higher levels of al-
cohol consumption have already been reported to be
harmful in overweight and obese subjects.7
The primary disease under investigation was suspected
NAFLD, which was defined using unexplained serum ala-
nine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation. The use of ALT
with exclusion of causes other than NAFLD is justified by
several lines of reasoning. Among patients who are re-
ferred to a hepatologist and undergo a liver biopsy for
unexplained ALT elevation, up to 90% will have a clini-
copathological diagnosis of NAFLD.14-16 As opposed to a
clinical hepatology referral hepatology population, in a
population-based study such as NHANES, unexplained
ALT elevations may be even more likely to be due to
NAFLD.17 Therefore, we excluded subjects without data
on ALT and those subjects with identifiable conditions
other than NAFLD to account for ALT elevation. These
conditions include excessive alcohol consumption (1
alcoholic beverage per day), viral hepatitis (positive hep-
atitis B surface antigen, positive hepatitis C antibody),
iron overload (transferitin saturation 50%), and use of
medications associated with hepatotoxicity (androgens,
antivirals medications, antifungals medications, nitrofu-
ratoin, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trazadone, or tetracy-
cline). After exclusion of these conditions, unexplained
ALT elevation was strongly associated with adiposity and
other features of the metabolic syndrome, and thus con-
sistent with NAFLD.18 Moreover, those forms of chronic
liver disease not tested are sufficiently uncommon that
they were unlikely to contribute significantly to the cause
of ALT elevation.19 (Refer to the inclusion and exclusion
flowchart in Fig. 1.)
Suspected NAFLD. Given the lack of a single uni-
form cut point for ALT elevation we chose to use both the
higher cut point of the NHANES III reference laboratory
(ALT  43 U/L for both genders, referred to in this work
as the laboratory cut point) and the widely used gender-
specific lower cut point based on the 95th percentile of
healthy subjects (ALT  30 for men, ALT 19 for
woman, referred to in this work as the healthy cut
point).12,20 In addition to the bivariate cut points, the
log-transformed ALT was also analyzed as a continuous
variable.
Modest Wine, Beer, and Liquor Drinkers. The pri-
mary exposure of interest was self-report of modest wine
drinking versus no alcohol consumption. To distinguish
wine from alcohol more generally, the association of mod-
est beer and liquor drinking were also studied. The alco-
hol history was obtained by a trained interviewer in a
private room to ensure confidentiality. A nondrinker was
a person that reported no wine, beer, or liquor per month.
A beverage preference (for example, wine, beer, or liquor)
was defined as the type of alcohol whose consumption
accounted for the majority of the total alcohol intake.21
Participants who did not have a preferred alcoholic bev-
erage were defined as mixed drinkers. Modesty was de-
fined as alcohol consumption up to an average of one
drink per day. One drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer,
4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of liquor.7

Social, Demographic, and Lifestyle Confounders.
Social, demographic, and lifestyle confounders were con-
sidered to include age, gender, race, poverty income ratio,
neighborhood population density, years of education, caf-
feine intake, and activity level.12 In NHANES III the
prevalence of suspected NAFLD did not have a linear
relationship with age. Therefore, age was adjusted using a
categorical variable (21 to 40, 41 to 60, and 60 years).
Neighborhood population density was based on U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture Rural/Urban continuum codes.
Participants were also asked if they considered themselves
more active, less active, or the same as same-age sex peers.
Participants were asked about their monthly consump-
tion of caffeine-containing beverages. Total caffeine in-
take was calculated as (regular coffee  136 mg per cup 
regular tea  64 mg per cup  soda  46 mg per can or
bottle)/30.22 The caffeine intake was not normally dis-
tributed and therefore we used the loge
-transformed caf-
feine intake for analysis.
Metabolic Syndrome Features. NAFLD is closely as-
sociated with the metabolic syndrome23,24 and wine has
been shown to ameliorate many metabolic syndrome fea-
tures.9-11,25,26 Therefore, the following list of metabolic
syndrome features were studied as we explored the poten-
tial protective mechanisms of modest wine drinking:
body mass index (BMI) (weight [kg]/height [m]2), waist
circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), systolic blood
pressure (SBP), diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, diabetes,
triglyceride level, high density lipoprotein (HDL) level,
and insulin sensitivity. Participants were considered to
have diabetes if they reported having a diagnosis of diabe-
tes or if they had glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin
A1c
) above 6.5%.27 Triglyceride level and insulin resis-
tance were only considered only in subjects with 8
hours of fasting prior to phlebotomy. Triglyceride level
was not normally distributed and therefore the loge
-trans-
formed triglyceride level was used for analysis. Insulin
resistance was measured as quantitative insulin sensitivity
check index (QUICKI  1/[log(fasting insulin [lU/
mL])  log(fasting glucose [mg/dL])].28
Statistical Methods. NHANES III was based on a
complex, multistage, stratified, clustered probability sam-
pling that could not be treated as a simple random sample.
The SUDAAN 9.0 module (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC) was used to incorporate pri-
mary sampling unit (sdppsu6), strata (sdpstra6), and
weighting (wtpfhx6) into the analysis.12
Logistic regression was used to assess the association
between reported nondrinkers, modest wine drinkers,
modest beer drinkers, and modest liquor drinkers with
suspected NAFLD. The outcome variable was suspected
NAFLD based on each of the two ALT cut points. Our
first multivariate model aimed to adjust for potential con-
founders and included the entire social, demographic,
and lifestyle confounders listed above. Effect modifica-
tion of modest wine drinking with age, gender, race, and
BMI was tested using product variables (for example,
modest wine drinking  age). Linear regression was used
to estimate the association of modest wine drinking with
loge
(ALT) as a continuous variable.
Subjects identified with pre-existing conditions known
to be aggravated by alcohol might be less likely to con-
sume alcohol. Subjects may also stop drinking alcohol
because of illness related to alcohol. To reduce potential
selection bias, a separate analysis excluded nondrinkers
who reported a lifetime cumulative intake of more than
12 alcoholic drinks, and excluded subjects who reported
having a diagnosis of diabetes, gallbladder, liver, or pan-
creatic disease, and subjects counseled by their physician
to cut down on alcohol due to hypertension.
To explore the potential protective mechanism of
modest wine drinking, metabolic syndrome features were
included in the second and third multivariate model. The
mechanism of modest wine drinking was considered to be
independent of metabolic syndrome features if the odds
ratio (OR) of wine drinking remained unchanged after
correction for these metabolic syndrome features.22 Our
second multivariate model included all the variables in the
first multivariate model with the addition of BMI, WHR,
SBP, DBP, HDL, and diabetes status. Our third multi-
variate included all the variables in the second multivari-
ate model with the addition of triglyceride level and
QUICKI, which were only available in participants with
8 hours of fasting prior to phlebotomy (n  2,840).
Results
Study Sample. The study sample included 7,211
nondrinkers, 945 modest wine drinkers, 2,237 modest
beer drinkers, 688 modest liquor drinkers, and 673 mod-
est mixed drinkers. Refer to Fig. 1 for the inclusion and
exclusion flowchart. Table 1 illustrates the social, demo-
graphic, and lifestyle characteristics of the four groups. As
compared to nondrinkers, modest wine drinkers were
younger, more likely to be non-Hispanic white and fe-
male, to reside in a rural area, to have more years of edu-
cation and a higher income, and to consider themselves
more active than their same age-matched and sex-
matched peers.
Prevalence of Suspected NAFLD in Nondrinkers
and Modest Alcohol Drinkers. Based on the laboratory
cut point, suspected NAFLD was observed in 3.2% of
nondrinkers, 0.4% of modest wine drinkers, 3.5% of
modest beer drinkers, 2.3% of modest liquor drinkers,
HEPATOLOGY, Vol. 47, No. 6, 2008 DUNN, XU, AND SCHWIMMER 1949
and 2.6% of modest mixed drinkers. Using the healthy
cut point, suspected NAFLD was observed in 14.3% of
nondrinkers, 8.6% of modest wine drinkers, 12.4% of
modest beer drinkers, 14.9% of modest liquor drinkers,
and 10.3% of modest mixed drinkers. Table 2 lists the
prevalence and adjusted OR of suspected NAFLD in each
drinking category. Compared to nondrinkers, only mod-
est wine drinkers were consistently associated with a lower
prevalence of suspected NAFLD across both cut points.
After correction for all social, demographic, and behav-
ioral characteristics (multivariate model 1) (Table 3), the
adjusted OR for suspected NAFLD was 0.15 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.49) based on the laboratory
cut point and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.33-0.79) based on the
healthy cut point. There were no significant interactions
between wine drinking and age (P  0.97), gender (P 
0.99), race (P  0.84), or BMI (P  0.80). When treated
as a continuous variable, loge
(ALT) was significantly
lower in modest wine drinkers than in nondrinkers (uni-
variate analysis P  0.006, multivariate analysis P 
0.001).
In a separate, more restrictive, analysis that excluded
nondrinkers who reported more than 12 alcoholic
drinks in their lifetime, and excluded subjects who
were told by their doctors that they had diabetes, gall-
bladder, liver, or pancreatic conditions, or to decrease
their alcohol consumption due to hypertension (non-
drinkers n  1,841, modest wine drinkers n  903),
the protective association of modest wine drinking re-
mained unchanged (laboratory cut point adjusted OR
0.14, 95% CI, 0.03-0.73; healthy cut point adjusted
OR 0.51, 95% CI, 0.30-0.85).

When the four groups of modest drinkers were pooled
together, the prevalence of suspected NAFLD was 2.4%
using the laboratory cut point and 11.6% using the
healthy cut-point. After adjusting for social, demo-
graphic, and behavioral characteristics, the adjusted OR
for suspected NAFLD was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.36-0.96)
based on the laboratory cut point and 0.70 (95% CI,
0.53-0.93) based on the healthy cut point.
Metabolic Syndrome Features as Potential Protec-
tive Mechanisms. Compared to nondrinkers, wine
drinkers had lower BMI, WHR, SBP, DBP, triglyceride
level, and higher insulin sensitivity. Wine drinkers also
had a significantly lower prevalence of diabetes and met-
abolic syndrome. For men, but not for women, modest
wine drinkers had a smaller waist circumference and
higher HDL (Table 4). As reported,29 high BMI, WHR,
waist circumference, triglyceride level, and DBP, and low
HDL and QUICKI, as well as diabetes and metabolic
syndrome, were significantly associated with suspected
NAFLD. After controlling for the features of the meta-
bolic syndrome in multivariate models 2 and 3, the ad-
justed OR of wine drinking remained significant and
unchanged (Table 3).
Prevalence of Suspected NAFLD in Modest Wine
Drinkers Compared to Other Types of Modest Alcohol
Drinkers. Based on the laboratory cut point, both mod-
est beer drinkers and modest liquor drinkers were signif-
icantly associated with a higher prevalence of suspected
NAFLD compared to modest wine drinkers. After adjust-
ing for all social, demographic, and behavioral character-
istics, modest beer drinkers, modest liquor drinkers, and
modest mixed drinkers compared to modest wine drink-
ers had 4.18 (95% CI, 1.42-12.33) times, 4.77 (95% CI,
1.34-16.90) times, and 4.32 (95% CI, 1.39-13.42) times
the odds of having suspected NAFLD, respectively. Based
on the healthy cut point, the association was only signif-
icant between modest liquor drinkers and modest wine
drinkers (adjusted OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.17-3.30).
Discussion
This cross-sectional population-based study showed
that self-report of wine consumption up to one serving
per day compared to no alcohol use is associated with a
lower prevalence of suspected NAFLD. Both the higher
NHANES laboratory reference cut point and the lower
gender-specific cut point based on the 95th percentile of
healthy subjects were used. After adjusting for social, de-
mographic, and lifestyle differences, multivariate analysis
showed that modest wine drinking was independently
associated with lower prevalence of suspected NAFLD.

Subjects identified with pre-existing conditions known to
be aggravated by alcohol might be less likely to consume
alcohol. Subjects may also stop drinking alcohol due to
health problems from alcohol. Exclusion of these subjects
did not affect the result. Although modest wine drinkers
had fewer metabolic characteristics associated with
NAFLD, these metabolic characteristics do not appear to
explain the potential protective mechanism of modest
wine drinking.
NAFLD is the most common liver disease in the
United States. As many as one-third of adults in the
United States may have fatty liver based on magnetic res-
onance screening30 and living donor liver biopsy.31 It has
been demonstrated that at least 5% of adults with
NAFLD will develop cirrhosis.32 The current study sug-
gests that modest wine drinking is associated with a de-
creased prevalence of NAFLD. The cross-sectional design
of the current study cannot address whether this observa-
tion is causative or associative, and whether wine is pre-
ventive or therapeutic. Nevertheless, this study presents a
paradigm shift that modest wine consumption may not
only be safe from a liver perspective but may actually
decrease the prevalence of NAFLD. These data may be
considered preliminary evidence supporting prospective
studies of modest wine drinking in the prevention and
treatment of NAFLD.
NAFLD shares many risk factors with CHD and there-
fore people at risk for NAFLD are likely to be at risk for
CHD.3,33 From a cardiology and primary care perspec-
tive, the recommendation of alcohol use for cardioprotec-
tion in patients who are at risk for CHD, and thus at risk
for NAFLD as well, is controversial because excessive al-
cohol intake may lead to liver injury. The current study
suggests that modest wine consumption may be actually
be protective against NAFLD and therefore supports the
use of up to one glass of wine per day for cardioprotection
in people at risk for both CHD and NAFLD.
Interaction with age and BMI must be considered in
the study of alcohol's association with liver injury. Ruhl
and Everhart7 showed that overweight subjects have a
lower threshold for alcohol-induced liver injury than nor-
mal weight subjects. Suzuki et al.34 showed that the influ-
ence of alcohol on liver injury varies with age. The current
study specifically focused on wine, rather than all alcohol
drinking, and at a lower level than the studies by Ruhl and
Everhart7 or Suzuki et al.34 The protective association of
modest wine drinking was not different across age and
BMI. This finding is important because middle-age and
overweight people may benefit the most from the cardio-
protective effect and the potential liver protective effect of
modest wine drinking.
Our study adds to the body of evidence that supports
the liver protective role of modest wine drinking. The
Copenhagen cohort35 of 30,630 individuals followed for
417,325 person-years demonstrated that participants
who drank one to seven servings of wine per week had the
lowest risk of developing cirrhosis. A prospective Japanese
study34 following 326 male government workers for 5
years found that the incidence of hypertransaminasemia
was lower in subjects who drank 140 g to 280 g of alcohol
per week compared to subjects who drank none or up to
one drink per week. Although subjects predisposed36 to
alcoholic liver disease (for example, previous history of
hypertransaminasemia or alcoholic liver disease) were ex-
cluded from the study, the finding did suggest a potential
protective role of alcohol. In a small study of morbidly
obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery,37 any alcohol
consumption compared to no alcohol was associated with
decreased prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the
histologically severe form of NAFLD. However, these pa-
tients are not representative of the general population and
alcohol amount, frequency, and type were not clearly de-
lineated.
Both alcohol and nonalcohol components of wine may
each be responsible for the lower prevalence of some of the
metabolic syndrome features in the current study. Alco-
hol consumption has been reported to prevent diabetes
and improve insulin resistance.9,38,39 Nonalcohol compo-
nents of wine have been shown to lower serum triglycer-
ide levels.40,41 Both alcohol42,43 and nonalcohol wine
components40,41 have been shown to increase serum HDL
levels. Wine, but not other alcohol, has been shown to be
inversely associated with central obesity.44 Our study con-
firms that modest wine drinking is associated with a de-
creased prevalence of these metabolic syndrome features.
Despite the inverse association between modest wine
drinking and metabolic syndrome features, the improve-
ment in metabolic profile does not account for the liver
protective association of modest wine drinking. In multi-
variate analysis, correcting for all of those biological vari-
ables did not attenuate the OR, suggesting that the
potential protective mechanism of modest wine drinking
is independent of these biological features.22 Further-
more, both modest beer and liquor consumption were
also associated with improvement in metabolic syndrome
features but they were not associated with lower preva-
lence of suspected NAFLD. Although modest alcohol
drinkers pooled together as a group were associated with
lower prevalence of suspected NAFLD, it was modest
wine drinkers that accounted for the association. We pos-
tulate that the protective property of modest wine drink-
ing, if present, is mediated through its nonalcohol rather
than its alcohol components. The exact protective mech-

anisms cannot readily be measured in the NHANES III
database.
The current study has a number of important method-
ological characteristics that allow accurate assessment of
the association between modest wine drinking and sus-
pected NAFLD. Notably, the use of NHANES makes the
findings generalizable to the U.S. population. As such, the
use of unexplained ALT elevation as a surrogate of
NAFLD is imperfect but appropriate for a large popula-
tion-based study. Without excluding alternative diagno-
sis, in the Dallas Heart Study30 over half of participants
with abnormal ALT had fatty liver based on magnetic
resonance spectroscopy while nearly three-quarters of par-
ticipants with normal ALT did not have fatty liver. After
excluding alternative causes of elevated ALT and/or fatty
liver, population-based studies in Israel,45 Japan,46 and
Taiwan47 showed that the positive predictive value (60%-
90%) and negative predictive value (70%-90%) of ALT
were even stronger. Importantly, the current study made
use of strict exclusion criteria to exclude excessive alcohol,
viral hepatitis, iron overload, and hepatotoxic medica-
tions. When similar exclusions were applied in case series
of unexplained ALT elevation, liver biopsy revealed a pos-
itive predictive value of 65%-90%.14-16 Together, these
data support the contention that the majority of partici-
pants in the current study were accurately classified as
having or not having suspected NAFLD. Because the spe-
cific positive and negative predictive values will vary de-
pending on the ALT cut point being used, two well-
recognized cut points were used in this study. While the
possibility remains that the protective effect of wine ap-
plies to other forms of liver injury, it is most likely attrib-
utable to effects on fatty liver. Although imperfect, any
misclassification bias based on the ALT should affect wine
drinkers and nondrinkers equally and therefore would
only falsely diminish the size of the association observed.
The use of standardized methodology with trained inter-
viewers was important for the accuracy of the data but
cannot fully eliminate errors in the self-reported amount
and type of alcohol consumed. To adjust for confounders,
social, demographic, and lifestyle covariates were entered
into the multivariate analysis and the protective associa-
tion of modest wine drinking remained unchanged. This
minimized, although did not completely exclude, the pos-
sibility that self-report of modest wine drinking was a
surrogate marker of another unmeasured lifestyle factor.
Finally, the cross-sectional design cannot demonstrate the
safety of modest wine consumption in subjects with pre-
existing NAFLD. The preventive and therapeutic poten-
tial of modest wine drinking should be further explored
by prospective cohort and experimental studies.
The current study presents a paradigm shift that mod-
est wine consumption may not only be safe from a liver
perspective but may actually decrease the prevalence of
NAFLD. This can be considered initial evidence to sup-
port future prospective studies with either wine or nonal-
cohol wine components for prevention or treatment of
NAFLD. In patients at risk for both CHD and NAFLD,
up to one serving of wine per day for cardioprotection is
likely safe from a liver perspective, although wine con-
sumption for cardioprotection remains an important de-
cision at the discretion of the individual and the
physician. Finally, we must emphasize that the current
study does not support the use of wine or alcohol at more
than one serving per day. The adverse consequence of
excessive alcohol intake has been well established from
previous studies.5 Patients at risk for developing alcohol
abuse should not be advised to consume wine.
