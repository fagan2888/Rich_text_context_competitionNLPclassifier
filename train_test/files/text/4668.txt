Resources, Harshness, and Unpredictability:
The Socioeconomic Conditions Associated
With the Dark Triad Traits
Peter K. Jonason1, Adiba Icho1, and Katie Ireland1
Abstract
We sought to test the hypothesis that the Dark Triad traits are condition-dependent responses to a particular set of socio-
ecological conditions in childhood. In three cross-sectional studies (N ¼ 1,403), we examined how the Dark Triad traits were
correlated with measures of resource availability, harshness, and unpredictability in one's childhood and adulthood. The Dark
Triad traits were correlated with self-reports of an unpredictable childhood when using both the Short Dark Triad and the Dirty
Dozen measures. These effects were somewhat stronger in men than in women and were replicable across samples. We also
replicated sex differences in the Dark Triad traits but found none for our measures of socioecological conditions. Results are
discussed in terms of the recurrent unpredictability in evolutionary history necessitating the sensitivity and responsiveness to such
features to enable survival and reproduction. We contend that the Dark Triad traits might be condition-sensitive adaptations to
socioecological unpredictability that all people could have if properly motivated.

Introduction
For years, the personality psychology landscape has been dom-
inated by the Big Five traits (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness,
neuroticism, conscientiousness, and openness/intellect; Costa
& McCrae, 1995). While still important in understanding
sweeping aspects of personality, the taxonomy may fall short
in its ability to tap some of the ``darker'' and less socially
desirable aspects of individual differences. One stream of
research that has been quickly gaining momentum and addres-
sing this theoretical and empirical gap is the work on the Dark
Triad traits (e.g., Furnham, Richards, & Paulhus, 2013; Jona-
son, Webster, Schmitt, Li, & Crysel, 2012). The Dark Triad
traits are characterized by vanity and self-centeredness (i.e.,
narcissism), manipulation and cynicism (i.e., Machiavellian-
ism), and callous social attitudes and amorality (i.e., psycho-
pathy). The traits have implications for organizational
psychology (Spain, Harms, & Leberton, 2014), social psychol-
ogy (Hodson, Hogg, & MacInnis, 2009), clinical psychology
(Jonason & Tost, 2010; D. Jones & Paulhus, 2011), and health
(Jonason, Baughman, Carter, & Parker, 2015; Jonason, Koenig,
& Tost, 2010).
One reason for the momentum these traits have garnered
stems from their integration into an evolutionary or adaptionist
paradigm (Carter, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014; Jonason, Jones,
& Lyons, 2013). The integration into this paradigm has pro-
vided a new way of interpreting the many factors associated
with the Dark Triad traits, one that does not assume dysfunc-
tionality and encourages domain specificity in its predictions.
For instance, the Dark Triad traits facilitate a short-term
(Jonason, Li, Webster, & Schmitt, 2009) and exploitive (Jona-
son, Girgis, & Milne-Home, 2015) mating strategy in men and
a social strategy characterized by a protean approach to manip-
ulation (Jonason & Webster, 2012) and limited empathy which
could be instrumental in taking advantage of others (Jonason,

Lyons, Bethel, & Ross, 2013) in both sexes. However, what is
less clear is why these traits persist in the population and how
they can best be understood. Their persistence suggests an
evolutionary model might be useful in understanding these
traits.
Evidence is overwhelming. The Dark Triad traits are heri-
table with meaningful unshared environmental variance (Fig-
ueredo, Va
´squez, Brumbach, & Schneider, 2004; Petrides,
Vernon, Schermer, & Veselka, 2011; Vernon, Villani, Vickers,
& Harris, 2008). However, few attempts have been made to
understand what the environmental variance is. If we consider a
Gene Â Environment interaction, it may be that the disposi-
tions found in the Dark Triad traits might be condition-
sensitive adaptations to socioecological stress. That is, while
there is substantial genetic variance associated with individual
differences in the Dark Triad traits, genes are not sufficient to
explain the complete picture. It may be that all people could be
high or low on the Dark Triad traits if properly motivated.1
While prior authors have examined how childhood conditions
are related to personality traits like Machiavellianism (i.e.,
Slaughter, 2011) and narcissism (i.e., Lyons, Morgan, Thomas,
& Al Hashmi, 2013), few have examined all three traits simul-
taneously (an important task because they overlap and are
argued to be part of a coordinated system; Figueredo, Gladden,
Sisco, Patch, & Jones, 2015), have not taken an evolutionary
perspective, and did not assess general (albeit recalled) child-
hood conditions and socioeconomic status.
In understanding the role of the childhood conditions on the
development of personality, both the harshness (e.g., agree-
ment with the statement ``I grew up in a relatively wealthy
neighborhood''; Brumbach, Figueredo, & Ellis, 2009; Ellis,
Figueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer, 2009) and the predicability
(e.g., agreement with the statement ``Things were often chaotic
in my house''; Belsky, 2012; Belsky, Schlomer, & Ellis, 2012)
matter. For instance, the unpredictability of one's environment
appears to increase mortality salience, future discounting,
short-term mating strategies, and risk taking (Griskevicius,
Delton, Robertson, & Tybur, 2011; Griskevicius, Tybur, Del-
ton, & Robertson, 2011; Griskevicius et al., 2013), whereas the
harshness predicts withdrawal as a self-protective measure
(Bowlby, 1979). Consistent information about predictability
and harshness (or lack thereof) may be encoded through adap-
tive heuristics that are especially sensitive to feedback from the
world in one's childhood. Generally speaking, we expect the
Dark Triad traits to be more strongly and consistently corre-
lated with unpredictability as opposed to harshness.
Unpredictability is associated with various apparent mani-
festations of a fast life history strategy (e.g., short-term mating;
Belsky, 2012), and the Dark Triad traits have been identified as
capturing similar variance (Jonason et al., 2010; Jonason, Li, &
Teicher, 2010; Jonason et al., 2009). Unpredictability should
set a young person's brain to see the world as being capricious
and irregular, thus making investment in long-term, mutualistic
strategies seem limited in utility and payoff. This information
may allow people to develop preconceived notions (whether
accurate or not) about the kind of life to expect and to set their
approach to life to match.2 The Dark Triad traits may represent
solutions to life's challenges that are sensitive to this informa-
tion. In addition, men may be more likely than women are to
develop a ``Dark Triad response'' to unpredictability, as the
relative payoff is greater for men than for women.
That said, the Dark Triad traits do not fully overlap. The
portions of the traits that do not overlap may permit correla-
tions with measures of harshness as well. For instance, narcis-
sism and, to a lesser extent, Machiavellianism might be
activated in light of favorable economic conditions; in other
words, such conditions may create a sense of entitlement and
self-love that can accompany the presence and access to finan-
cial stability/abundance (i.e., spoiled brats). Finally, there may
be aspects of the psychopathy construct like criminality (i.e.,
factor 2) that may be sensitive to economic hardship (Harpur,
Hare, & Hakstian, 1989). Such information would make the
apparent payoff ratio sufficiently high that criminality might be
a reasonable response to the world.
The Dark Triad traits are associated with various kinds of
apparently socially undesirable behaviors and attitudes. Given
that generations of individual, societal, institutional, and gov-
ernmental efforts have attempted to reduce such behavior, it is
surprising (to some) that these traits persist. One reason may be
that they are present in all people, in their genetic background,
but are not necessarily activated to ``problematic'' levels in all
people. For those people who experience the right (or wrong,
depending on perspective) socioecological conditions, these
traits may be important in allowing some people to get what
they want out of what they perceive to be a capricious world.
Study 1
In this study, we examine whether the Dark Triad traits are
sensitive to individual differences in the quality of one's access
to financial and familial resources. We examine how the Dark
Triad traits are related to various indicators of socioeconomic
status and whether those associations are moderated by parti-
cipant's sex. Finally, we replicate sex differences in the Dark
Triad traits and test for equivalence in the sexes in relation to
socioecological indicators.
Method
Participant and Procedure
Two hundred and eighty four (46% female) Americans (83%
White/Caucasian) aged 18­71 years (M ¼ 35.63, SD ¼ 11.64)
participated in a larger online study concerning the Dark Triad
traits in exchange for US$1 on Amazon's Mechanical Turk
(i.e., mTurk; Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011). Only
those participants who completed the measures from unique
IP addresses were included. Participants were informed of the
nature of the study and were asked to give consent if they
wished to participate, and only those who gave consent were
included. They progressed through a series of self-report
2 Evolutionary Psychology
measures that assessed the variables of interest. At the end of
the study, participants were debriefed and thanked.
Measures
To measure the Dark Triad traits, we used the Short Dark Triad
(SD3; D. N. Jones & Paulhus, 2014). It is a concise, 27-item
personality inventory. Participants were asked to report their
agreement (1 ¼ Strongly disagree; 5 ¼ Strongly agree) with
statements measuring Machiavellianism (e.g., ``Most people
are suckers''), narcissism (e.g., ``I am an average person''), and
psychopathy (e.g., ``I like to pick on losers''). Items were aver-
aged to create indices of Machiavellianism (a ¼ .84), narcis-
sism (a ¼ .81), and psychopathy (a ¼ .79).3
We measured socioecological conditions with a multidi-
mensional measure (Griskevicius, Delton, et al., 2011; Griske-
vicius, Tybur, et al., 2011) that taps various aspects of
childhood and adult conditions. Participants completed the
measures of childhood socioeconomic status (e.g., ``I grew
up in a relatively wealthy neighborhood''; a ¼ .85), family
resources (e.g., ``familial support for food''; a ¼ .91), child-
hood unpredictability (e.g., ``Things were often chaotic in my
house''; a ¼ .80), and current socioeconomic status (e.g., ``I
feel relatively wealthy these days''; a ¼ .90). Participants also
estimated, on single-item measures, their household income
when they were a child and currently (1 ¼ Less than
US$15,000; 8 ¼ More than US$150,000). Correlations among
these items can be found in Appendix A.
We also measured the Big Five traits as controls, using the
20-item short International Personality Item Pool (Donnellan,
Oswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006). Participants were asked the
degree to which they agreed (1 ¼ Very inaccurate; 5 ¼ Very
accurate) with statements such as the following: ``Have a vivid
imagination'' (i.e., openness), ``Get chores done right away''
(i.e., conscientiousness), ``I am the life of the party'' (i.e.,
extraversion), ``Sympathize with others' feelings'' (i.e., agree-
ableness), and ``Have frequent mood swings'' (i.e., neuroti-
cism). Items were averaged to create composites of openness
(a ¼ .81), conscientiousness (a ¼ .58), extraversion (a ¼ .82),
agreeableness (a ¼ .84), and neuroticism (a ¼ .80).
Results
We replicated (Jonason, Li, & Czarna, 2013) sex differences in
the Dark Triad traits with men scoring higher than women in all
three cases (Table 1). There were no sex differences in the
various socioecological indicators including current income.
The Dark Triad traits were all correlated with an unpredictable
environment as a child (Table 2). Machiavellianism and nar-
cissism were associated with good current socioeconomic sta-
tus, whereas narcissism was correlated with good
socioeconomic conditions as a child. These correlations did not
differ much in men and women with one exception. That is, the
correlation between narcissism and income when growing up
was larger (Fisher's z ¼ 1.67, p < .05) in men (r ¼ .17, p < .05)
than in women (r ¼ À.03).
In hopes of saying something larger about the relationship
between socioecological conditions and the Dark Triad traits,
we adopted a Dark Triad composite (Jonason et al., 2009)
approach by averaging scores on each of the Dark Triad traits

(66.92% of the variance was accounted for; eigen ¼ 2.01;
Loadings .76­.86; Cronbach's a ¼ .75). The Dark Triad com-
posite was correlated with an unpredictable childhood (r[282]
¼.20, p < 01), current socioeconomic status (r[282] ¼.17,
p < 01), and current household income (r[282] ¼.15, p < 01).
These correlations did not differ across participant's sex, and
the omitted correlations did not differ from zero.
Finally, we sought to make sure that the relationships reported
in Table 2 were robust to the removal of variances associated with
the Big Five traits. The Big Five did show various associations
with the measures of resources in childhood and adulthood (see
Table 3). The associations generally remained. For instance, nar-
cissism was correlated with current income (pr ¼ .12, p < .05),
and Machiavellianism was correlated with current socioeco-
nomic status (pr ¼ .12, p < .05). Narcissism (pr ¼ .13, p < .05),
psychopathy (pr ¼ .20, p < .01), and the Dark Triad composite
(pr ¼ .17, p < .01) were correlated with an unpredictable child-
hood environment but Machiavellianism dropped out (pr ¼ .09).
Details concerning these analyses are available upon request.
Study 2
Study 1 suggests the Dark Triad traits are all correlated with
unpredictable childhoods, consistent with predictions derived
from Life History Theory. However, it is limited in three ways.
First, it relied solely on an mTurk sample. Second, it relied on
only one measure of the Dark Triad traits. Third, it failed to take
into consideration the possibility that people--narcissists in par-
ticular--might inflate self-reports of their income and other such
factors. Therefore, in Study 2, we extend Study 1 by collecting
data from both mTurk and a snowball sample, using two brief
measures of the Dark Triad traits to ensure the relationships
reported were not measurement or sampling artifacts, and ensure
that our results were robust to the partialing of variance associ-
ated with individual differences in social desirability.
Method
Participants and Procedure
Four hundred and five (46% female) Americans (81% White/
Caucasian) aged 17­70 years (M ¼ 32.49, SD ¼ 11.05)
participated in a larger online study concerning the Dark Triad
traits. Two hundred and twenty of the participants were paid
though mTurk (US$1), and the remainder were volunteers
through Facebook and Socialpsychology.org.4 Only those par-
ticipants who completed the measures from unique IP
addresses were included. Participants were informed of the
nature of the study and were asked to give consent if they
wished to participate, and only those who gave consent were
included. They progressed through a series of self-report mea-
sures that assessed the variables of interest. At the end of the
study, participants were debriefed and thanked.
Measures
Despite its limited validity and psychometric limitations
(Carter, Campbell, Muncer, & Carter, 2015; Maples, Lamkin,
& Miller, 2014; Miller et al., 2012), we wanted to test the
robustness of the correlations reported in Study 1 in another
brief measures of the Dark Triad, the Dirty Dozen (Jonason &
Webster, 2010). Participants were asked how much they agreed
(1 ¼ Not at all; 5 ¼ Very much) with statements such as ``I have
used deceit or lied to get my way'' (i.e., Machiavellianism),
``I tend to want others to admire me'' (i.e., narcissism), and
``I tend to lack remorse'' (i.e., psychopathy), and items were
averaged together to create an index of Machiavellianism
(Cronbach's a ¼ .76), narcissism (a ¼ .83), and psychopathy
(a ¼ .83).5
We also used the SD3 (D. N. Jones & Paulhus, 2014). It is a
concise, 27-item personality inventory. Participants were asked
to report their agreement (1 ¼ Strongly disagree; 5 ¼ Strongly
agree) with statements measuring Machiavellianism (e.g.,
``Most people are suckers''), narcissism (e.g., ``I am an average
person''), and psychopathy (e.g., ``I like to pick on losers'').
Items were averaged to create indices of Machiavellianism
(a ¼ .80), narcissism (a ¼ .79), and psychopathy (a ¼ .75).6
We measured socioecological conditions as we did in Study
1 (i.e., Griskevicius, Delton, et al., 2011; Griskevicius, Tybur,
et al., 2011). Participants completed the measures of childhood
socioeconomic status (a ¼ .85), family resources (a ¼ .91),
childhood unpredictability (a ¼ .80), and current socioeco-
nomic status (a ¼ .90). Participants also reported their esti-
mated household income when they were a child and
currently on single-item measures. Correlations among these
items can be found in Appendix B.
We measured social desirability with a short, homogenous
measure of the Marlowe­Crowne scale (Strahan & Gerbasi,
1972). Ten items (e.g., ``I always try to practice what I
preach'') asked participants in a yes/no format to test for indi-
vidual differences in social desirability. Items were summed to
create an index of social desirability (a ¼ .68).7
Results
We replicated sex differences in the Dark Triad traits (Jonason
et al., 2013), and effects were present in both measures of the
Dark Triad traits (Table 4). Importantly, the Dark Triad traits,

whether they were measured with the Dirty Dozen or the SD3
(with the exception of the SD3 measure of Narcissism), were
associated with increased unpredictability in childhood, con-
firming contentions that the Dark Triad traits are sensitive to
the unpredictability in one's childhood (Table 5). In addition,
narcissism (measured with the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen and the
SD3) was associated with greater socioeconomic status and
household incomes in childhood and currently. Machiavellian-
ism was associated with better childhood conditions, and psy-
chopathy was associated with fewer family resources as a child,
but both were localized only to the Dirty Dozen measure.
We compared these correlations across men and women.
Although there were apparent differences (available upon
request), only three were significant. The correlation between
Machiavellianism (SD3 measure only) and family resources
was more strongly (Fisher's z ¼ À2.72, p < .01) correlated in
men (r ¼ À.22, p < 05) than in women (r ¼ .05). The correla-
tion between Machiavellianism (SD3 measure only) and unpre-
dictability was more strongly (z ¼ 2.53, p < .01) correlated in
men (r ¼ .24, p < 05) than in women (r ¼ À.01). Finally, the
correlation between narcissism (SD3 measure only) and
unpredictability was more strongly (z ¼ 2.31, p < .01) corre-
lated in men (r ¼ .33, p < 01) than in women (r ¼ .11).
Although thin, these moderated correlations suggest men's
latent Dark Triad mechanisms might be more sensitive to
socioecological conditions than women's are.
Principle components analyses with Oblmin rotations8 sug-
gested that the three Dark Triad traits in the SD3 (64.72% of the
variance was accounted for; eigen ¼ 1.94; Loadings .70­.88)
and the Dirty Dozen (62.31% of the variance accounted for;
eigen ¼ 1.87; Loadings .69­.88) loaded on a single factor
(Jonason et al., 2009). Therefore, we created composites of all
the items (to maximize variance) of the SD3 (a ¼ .88) and the
Dirty Dozen (a ¼ .86). The Dark Triad composite, when mea-
sured by the SD3, was correlated with childhood socioeco-
nomic status (r[402] ¼ .13, p < .05), unpredictability (r[402]
¼ .16, p < .01), childhood household income (r[402] ¼ .13,
p < .05), and current income (r[402] ¼ .11, p < .05). The Dark
Triad composite, when measured with the Dirty Dozen, was
correlated with childhood socioeconomic status (r[402] ¼ .12,
p < .05), unpredictability (r[402] ¼ .19, p < .01), and childhood
household income (r[402] ¼ .14, p < .01). When these

correlations were examined in men and women, an interesting
pattern emerged (Table 6). Favorable socioecologies focused
around money and were associated with higher Dark Triad
composite scores in women, than in men. In contrast, unpre-
dictable environments were associated with higher Dark Triad
composite scores in men, than in women.
Study 3
Studies 1 and 2 provided reasonably consistent evidence for our
primary hypothesis that the Dark Triad traits should be linked
to (self-reports) an unpredictable childhood that was robust to
removing variance associated with the Big Five traits and
social desirability and measurement variance in the Dark Triad
traits. However, the results are reliant on a single measure of
childhood conditions, a measure that has not been fully vetted
for validity and psychometric properties. Therefore, in Study 3,
we attempt to replicate these effects with a series of author-
generated, single-item measures in hopes of further testing our
hypotheses.

The sample was composed of 705 American participants (48%
male), aged 18­76 years (M ¼ 32.54, SD ¼ 11.42), who were
paid US$2 for their completion of a series of measures on
mTurk. Ethnically speaking, 7% were African American,
77% were European Americans, 7% were Asian American, and
8% were Middle Eastern American. Upon completion partici-
pants were thanked for their participation and debriefed.
Measures
To measure the Dark Triad traits, the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen
(Jonason & Webster, 2010) was used as before. Items were
averaged together to create an index of Machiavellianism
(a ¼ .80), narcissism (a ¼ .81), and psychopathy (a ¼ .70).9
We also averaged all 12 items to create a measure of the latent
Dark Triad (a ¼ .87).
In order to measure childhood conditions, we generated
our own measure. It was composed of items assessing
socioeconomic status, predictability, and harshness. Instead
of treating the items as indicators of latent construct, we
opted to treat each independently to bolster the nuance we
can provide. The particular items can be seen in Table 7.
When asking about socioeconomic status, participants were
presented with a scale that ranged from lower class to upper
class. When assessing childhood conditions, participants
reported their agreement (1 ¼ Not at all; 5 ¼ Very much)
with each item. Appendix C has correlations among these
indicators.
Results
In Table 7, we replicated sex differences in the Dark Triad traits
(Jonason et al., 2013). Men scored higher than women did on
all of the traits. Consistent with that mentioned earlier, there
were few sex differences in self-reports of resource conditions.
There were, however, two sex differences, albeit small in mag-
nitude. Men reported better socioeconomic status today and a
better childhood than women did.
In Table 8, we report correlations between the Dark Triad
traits and indicators of (perceived) childhood conditions.
Machiavellianism was associated with (perceptions of) an
unstable, unpredictable, harsh, and privileged yet stressful
childhood. Narcissism was associated with (perceptions of)
good socioeconomic status today and a privileged, good, and
easy childhood. Psychopathy was associated with (perceptions
of) an unstable, harsh, and stressful childhood. These results
conceptually--albeit imperfectly--replicate results from Stud-
ies 1 and 2 using an alternative measure of childhood
conditions.
We tested whether the correlations between the Dark Triad
traits and indicators of childhood conditions differed in each
sex. Given the large number of tests, we only report those
differences (i.e., Fisher's z) that were significant (p < .01); a
full report of all the correlations is available upon request. The
correlation between psychopathy and socioeconomic status
today was absent in men (r ¼ À.05, ns) but present in women
(r ¼ À.12, p < .05) which were significantly different associa-
tions (z ¼ 2.92). The correlation between psychopathy and self-
reports of a good childhood was absent in men (r ¼ .01, ns) but
present in women (r ¼ À.19, p < .01) which were significantly

different associations (z ¼ 2.67). The correlation between
Machiavellianism and socioeconomic status today was absent
in women (r ¼ À.04, ns) but present in men (r ¼ .13, p < .05)
which were significantly different associations (z ¼ 3.26). The
correlation between narcissism and socioeconomic judgments
of a good childhood was absent in women (r ¼ À.05, ns) but
present in men (r ¼ .21, p < .01) which were significantly
different associations (z ¼ 3.48).
As there were two sex differences in resource indicators,
mediation tests were conducted. In accounting for the sex dif-
ference in ratings of having a good socioeconomic status today,
we entered participants sex (b ¼ .11, p < .01) into Step 1 and
narcissism (b ¼ .11, p < .01) in Step 2. We found partial
mediation, DR2 ¼ .01, F(1, 698) ¼ 5.10, p < .05, where the
sex difference shrunk to .09 (p < .05). When we tried to account
for sex differences in self-reports of a good childhood, the
partial mediation effect was the same but marginally signifi-
cant, DR2 ¼ .01, F(1, 698) ¼ 3.35, p < .07. Given our adoption
of item-level analyses, such effects should be interpreted with
caution.
Discussion
``Why does evil exist?'' is a classic question about the nature of
the universe and humankind. Despite considerable efforts to
remove antisocial personality traits from the population
through religions (e.g., threat of damnation), laws (e.g., threat
of imprisonment), social movements (e.g., encouraging self-
esteem), and institutional sanctions (e.g., threat of being fired),
these traits persist and, by all accounts, may have always been
present. They may be impossible to remove as they are, to some
extent, present in everyone. All people may have the potential
to be high or low on the Dark Triad traits. This potential comes
from the encoded potential in the human genotype. Over the
course of their lives, events narrow that potential and shape
one's personality and attitudes to create their effective

phenotype. This means that exposure to specific conditions is
the precipitating factor, which determines people's trait activa-
tion and position on the Dark Triad continuum. Experiences (or
at the very least, recollection of) of childhood unpredictability
may be some of the prerequisite conditions to activate the
dormant selfishness, competiveness, and antisociality found
in the Dark Triad traits. While by no means definitive, the
present results are consistent with a condition-dependent model
of the Dark Triad traits.
Our contention, albeit tentative, is that the Dark Triad traits
are part of the encoded genotype of at least humans (if not most
species that could benefit from opportunism, selfishness, and
exploitiveness at times), but given contextual factors, they are
only the effective phenotype in a few. The Dark Triad traits
may be condition-dependent adaptations to solve life's adap-
tive problems in the face of an unpredictable and harsh world.
From this perspective, the Dark Triad traits could be phenoty-
pic responses to predetermined and evolutionary relevant infor-
mation, responses that might be stronger and more important in
men given asymmetries and costs and benefits for living a fast
life (Jonason et al., 2010; Jonason et al., 2009). Natural selec-
tion is likely to have shaped adaptive heuristics to take in
information about the quality of one's world, process that infor-
mation, and formulate a solution. This solution acts as the
vector one takes to solving the problems of finding mates,
keeping mates, protecting kin, and finding food and resources.
In the case of the Dark Triad traits, that solution appears to be
mate with various partners and lower one's standards (Jonason
et al., 2011); abandon mates and do not try to keep them (Jona-
son, Li, & Buss, 2010); be competitive, selfish, and manipula-
tive (Jonason et al., 2010; Jonason & Webster, 2012); and seek
immediate payoffs over delayed ones (Jonason et al., 2010).
The clinical implications for this are important. It suggests
those high in the Dark Triad traits may be unfairly vilified and
that the model for treating such disorders (i.e., a categorical
model) may start with a faulty premise. Many researchers, lay-
people, and clinicians may implicitly treat those with disorders
as qualitatively different than others. Instead, a condition-
sensitive model allows for genetic tendencies to interact with
environmental contingencies, thereby making far more people
susceptible to going down the path to the ``dark side.''
Prior research suggests there may be a higher order latent
Dark Triad factor that accounts for the shared variance in the
traits (Figueredo et al., 2015; Jonason, Kaufman, Webster, &
Geher, 2013; Jonason & Lu´
evano, 2013; Jonason & Webster,
2010). When we examined the Dark Triad composite (Jonason
et al., 2009), as a means to understand the shared variance in
the traits, we revealed that it was slightly more strongly corre-
lated with an unpredictable childhood than socioeconomic
hardship in Studies 1 and 2 but not Study 3, but the way we
calculated the composite differed. Both of these approaches
may be problematic, as they conflate the various aspects of
each part of the Dark Triad traits into one. However, as we did
not solely rely on this, we were able to show that unpredict-
ability in one's childhood is really where the Dark Triad traits
link to socioecological conditions, while the traits may have
their own, less replicable, and strong links to economic harsh-
ness in childhood and adulthood.
Limitations and Conclusions
Despite the novelty and rigor of our study, it has some limita-
tions. First, one might criticize our reliance on Western, Edu-
cated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD; see
Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010). The possibility exists that
the associations we found between child/adulthood socioecolo-
gical conditions and the Dark Triad traits might be localized to
Western, online samples. As long as we confine ourselves to
Western samples, we are confident in our conclusions. However,
if we begin to examine various cultural factors, our results might
be attenuated or even exacerbated, given local conditions and
even display rules related to collectivistic cultures.
Second, we relied on brief self-report measures throughout.
While we mostly used validated scales, this creates a number of
potential problems. Most important, we used the Dirty Dozen
measure twice which has a number of detractors (Carter et al.,
2015; Miller et al., 2012). In addition, we are relying on retro-
spective reports of people's childhood conditions. As is well
known in psychology, memory is frail. However, we see no
reason to think that such biases will be particularly localized to
those high on the Dark Triad traits but call for longitudinal
work to be done on the Dark Triad traits. In addition, we failed
to experimentally manipulate the conditions we feel act as
precursors to the Dark Triad traits. While that is reasonable,
we feel that the amount of exposure needed to create such
dispositions might be longer than we can achieve in a labora-
tory setting. Instead, what might be more fruitful is to see how
conditions vary or moderate the associations between the Dark
Triad traits and outcomes like selfishness or aggressiveness
that are seen as pivotal downstream correlates of the Dark Triad
traits. Finally, as we used brief measures of the Dark Triad
traits, we were not able to examine subfactors of the traits to
provide further nuance to test whether different aspects of these
multidimensional traits are sensitive to different inputs from
one's life. That said, it might be argued that once we start
examining parts of each trait, we will no longer be examining
the trait itself but something else that is related to the global
construct in question. Nevertheless, future research might pro-
vide such further nuance.
Third, our results did not fully converge in Study 3 relative
to the first two studies, and the results are not identical through-
out. This should not be of serious surprise in that we adopted
item-level analysis and used a different measure as we used in
Studies 1 and 2, and sample size can affect the power to detect
effects. The results from Study 3, therefore, only partially sup-
port our hypotheses. Studies 1 and 2 were more inconsistent
which is of no surprise, given measurement invariance. It
appears that psychopathy and Machiavellianism are the most
sensitive to childhood stress in the form of harshness and
unpredictability. Narcissism was associated with childhood
unpredictability, but such a link was allusive in Study 3 and
dependent on the measure of the Dark Triad traits in Study 2.
8 Evolutionary Psychology
Narcissism and, to a less degree, Machiavellianism were sen-
sitive to current and childhood economic conditions. Psycho-
pathy was only associated with harsh childhood conditions in
Studies 2 and 3. Nevertheless, these effects, in general, were
somewhat moderated by participant's sex, and sex differences
in self-reports of having a good childhood might be mediated
by individual differences in narcissism.
We do not contend that the Dark Triad traits are ubiqui-
tously adaptive. Indeed, only a naive evolutionary psychologist
would make such a domain-general prediction. Instead, the
functional utility of the Dark Triad traits and their related dis-
positions and biases are directly tied to a particular environ-
ment or niche. As a society, we may perceive the traits as
``bad'' because for many of us, the socioecological conditions
of our childhood have changed to the point that we wish to
punish people characterized by these traits (i.e., we have a
vested interest in long-term, mutualistic strategies). However,
let us not forget that during most of evolutionary history,
human lives were characterized by considerable unpredictabil-
ity (e.g., food shortages, injuries, deaths, and diseases). We
would contend that recurrent unpredictability in our evolution-
ary history would have created sensitivities to such information
about the world and adaptive responses. Just because the world
is harsh, does not mean an organism gives up. As Jeff Gold-
blum said in the first Jurassic Park movie, ``Life finds a way'';
one of those ways might be found in the Dark Triad traits.

suggesting how one might experimentally manipulate conditions
and see how conditions moderate the relationships between the
