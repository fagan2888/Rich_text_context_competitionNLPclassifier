Disorders Among Adolescents in the United States
Li-Tzy Wu, ScD; George E. Woody, MD; Chongming Yang, PhD; Jeng-Jong Pan, PhD; Dan G. Blazer, PhD, MD
Context: While young racial/ethnic groups are the fast-
est growing population in the United States, data about
substance-related disorders among adolescents of vari-
ous racial/ethnic backgrounds are lacking.
Objective: To examine the magnitude of past-year
DSM-IV substance-related disorders (alcohol, mari-
juana, cocaine, inhalants, hallucinogens, heroin, anal-
gesic opioids, stimulants, sedatives, and tranquilizers)
among adolescents of white, Hispanic, African Ameri-
can, Native American, Asian or Pacific Islander, and mul-
tiple race/ethnicity.
Design: The 2005 to 2008 National Survey on Drug Use
and Health.
Setting: Academic research.
Participants: Noninstitutionalized household adoles-
cents aged 12 to 17 years.
Main Outcome Measures: Substance-related disor-
ders were assessed by standardized survey questions ad-
ministered using the audio computer­assisted self-
interviewing method.
Results: Of 72561 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, 37.0%
used alcohol or drugs in the past year; 7.9% met criteria
forasubstance-relateddisorder,withNativeAmericanshav-
ing the highest prevalence of use (47.5%) and disorder
(15.0%). Analgesic opioids were the second most com-
monly used illegal drugs, following marijuana, in all racial/
ethnicgroups;analgesicopioidusewascomparativelypreva-
lent among adolescents of Native American (9.7%) and
multiple race/ethnicity (8.8%). Among 27705 past-year al-
cohol or drug users, Native Americans (31.5%), adoles-
centsofmultiplerace/ethnicity(25.2%),adolescentsofwhite
race/ethnicity(22.9%),andHispanics(21.0%)hadthehigh-
est rates of substance-related disorders. Adolescents used
marijuanamorefrequentlythanalcoholorotherdrugs,and
25.9% of marijuana users met criteria for marijuana abuse
or dependence. After controlling for adolescents' age, so-
cioeconomicvariables,populationdensityofresidence,self-
rated health, and survey year, adjusted analyses of adoles-
cent substance users indicated elevated odds of substance-
related disorders among Native Americans, adolescents of
multiple race/ethnicity, adolescents of white race/
ethnicity, and Hispanics compared with African Ameri-
cans; African Americans did not differ from Asians or Pa-
cific Islanders.
Conclusions: Substance use is widespread among ado-
lescents of Native American, white, Hispanic, and mul-
tiple race/ethnicity. These groups also are disproportion-
ately affected by substance-related disorders.

PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL AND
drug use in adolescence has
a negative influence on the
affected individuals, their
families, and society.1 Be-
cause psychoactive drugs alter neurotrans-
mission in the brain, repeated use could
have long-lasting adverse effects on brain
development and overall health.2-4 Early
substance use confers a heightened risk for
addiction, psychiatric and medical disor-
ders, poor psychosocial functioning, treat-
ment needs, and mortality.1-9 Adoles-
cence marks the period of life with the
highest risk for initiating substance use10;
thus, adolescents constitute a high-risk
group requiring research to guide preven-
tion efforts and health policy making. Fur-
thermore, there is a growing need for un-
derstanding substance-related disorders
among adolescents of various racial/
ethnic backgrounds to track health statis-
tics, plan for and improve health ser-
vices, and identify vulnerable subgroups
for focused intervention. Children and
adolescents of nonwhite race/ethnicity are
the fastest growing population; by 2030,
adolescents of nonwhite race/ethnicity are
projected to represent more than half of
the US population younger than 18 years.11
Therefore, many adolescents at risk to be-
gin substance use will be of nonwhite race/
ethnicity. For example, young Hispanics,
the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in

the United States, have an elevated risk for substance
use.11-14
While eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in health
problems and their treatment is a mission of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, few data about substance-
related disorders exist for young groups of nonwhite race/
ethnicity. Investigations of adolescents have focused
primarily on substance use among students, and assess-
ments for substance-related disorders are not included
in school-based surveys; when researchers have exam-
ined substance-related disorders, data are frequently lim-
ited to alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine, resulting in a lack
of data on other drug use disorders.15-19 In addition, sample
sizes of studies are often inadequate for examining young
Asians, Native Americans, and groups of multiple race/
ethnicity. The 2000 Census was the first US Census to
include the classification of multiple race/ethnicity,12 and
data about substance-related disorders for this group are
lacking. Results about "substance use" also are limited
for discerning important differences in substance use prob-
lems across racial/ethnic groups. An improved measure
of substance use problems, such as that provided by the
DSM-IV,20 is needed to better inform research, interven-
tion, and health policy making.
Furthermore, although investigators have reported ra-
cial/ethnic differences in substance use, findings of racial/
ethnic differences in problems related to various sub-
stances are inconsistent and sometimes difficult to
interpret.15 These discrepancies relate to various defini-
tions of substance use and at-risk groups (the denomi-
nators) used.15 Some investigations have examined sub-
stance use problems in a total sample, while others have
compared them among subgroups of substance users.
These variations in study designs complicate efforts to
compare substance use problems among racial/ethnic
groups and across substance classes. Moreover, US sur-
veys have shown a shifting pattern of substance use. Data
suggest that from 1999-2000, nonmedical analgesic opi-
oid use has increased to become more prevalent than in-
halant use among adolescents; from 2002 to 2009, past-
month use ranged from 2.3% to 3.2% for nonmedical
analgesic opioids compared with 1.0% to 1.3% for in-
halants.10,21-23 In addition, marijuana use has been in-
creasing after a few years of decline; alcohol use and ciga-
rette smoking among adolescents have declined.10,24,25
These changing patterns warrant research to identify ra-
cial/ethnic groups disproportionately affected by pre-
scription drug or marijuana use and reveal a need to evalu-
ate the comprehensive patterns of substance-related
disorders affecting various groups.10,25
In response to the growing population of adolescents
of nonwhite race/ethnicity, the scarcity of substance-
related disorder estimates, and shifting patterns of sub-
stance use, we examine data from the 2005 to 2008 Na-
tional Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to fill
this critical gap in substance-related disorder estimates
for young racial/ethnic groups. The NSDUH is a large on-
going survey, serving as the primary source for national
estimates of substance use and substance-related disor-
ders for the noninstitutionalized US population.10 The se-
lected years included designs that allowed the use of
pooled data to examine alcohol and 9 drug use disor-
ders across racial/ethnic groups and to compare the con-
ditional probability of substance-related disorders among
adolescent substance users. Multiple years of substance-
related disorder data assessed by the same instrument help
identify the extent of overlooked substance-related dis-
orders (prescription drug use disorders) for understud-
ied groups (ie, Asian, Native American, and multiple race/
ethnicity). To address the limitation of studies with
complicated comparisons of racial/ethnic differences ow-
ing to various denominators or definitions of substance
use, we focus on past-year substance use and substance-
related disorders, as they are better indicators of recent
or active substance use and treatment needs than life-
time measures.
To better inform etiological efforts, we expand on stud-
ies of substance use by examining the frequency of each
substance used and conditional probabilities of substance-
related disorders to characterize use patterns and iden-
tify subsets of adolescent users showing elevated odds
of having the disorder. The conditional prevalence of sub-
stance-relateddisordersconsiderssubstance-specificvaria-
tions in use by restricting the denominator for each sub-
stance-related disorder to adolescent users of the
corresponding substance, thereby allowing compari-
sons across substances. To mitigate for the confounding
effects on associations between race/ethnicity and sub-
stance use status, included as control variables were ado-
lescents' age, sex, family income, population density of
residence (adjusting for potential effects associated with
community economic characteristics, drug-using peers,
and availability of substances), and self-rated health (ad-
justing for potential effects associated with adolescents'
substance use and health status), as well as the survey
year.10,14,26-30
The following 3 main questions are addressed: (1) Are
there racial/ethnic differences in the 1-year prevalence
of substance-related disorders? (2) Are there racial/
ethnic differences in the 1-year conditional prevalence
of substance-related disorders among past-year adoles-
cent users of each corresponding substance class? (3) To
what extent is racial/ethnic status associated with each
substance-related disorder among adolescent substance
users after controlling for potentially confounding ef-
fects of adolescents' age, sex, family income, population
density of residence, self-rated health, and survey year?
METHODS
DATA SOURCE
This study was approved by the Duke University Institutional
Review Board, Durham, North Carolina. Data were from the
public use NSDUH data file from 2005 to 2008, the only sur-
vey designed to provide ongoing national estimates of sub-
stance use and substance-related disorders in the United
States.31,32 The target population includes residents of house-
holds from the 50 states (including shelters, rooming houses,
and group homes) and civilians residing on military bases. Par-
ticipants are selected by multistage area probability methods
to ensure that each independent cross-sectional sample is rep-
resentative of persons aged 12 years or older. The design over-
sampled people aged 12 to 25 years; because of a large sample

size, there was no need to oversample racial/ethnic groups (as
was done before 1999).31,32 Detailed information on sample de-
signs is provided by Morton et al.33
Prospective respondents are assured that their names will
not be recorded and their responses will be kept strictly con-
fidential. All study procedures and protections are carefully ex-
plained. For adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the field inter-
viewer first seeks verbal consent from their parents or guardians.
Once parental permission is granted, field interviewers then ap-
proach the adolescents and obtain their agreement to partici-
pate in the study. Parents are asked to leave the interview set-
ting to ensure the confidentiality of their children's responses.
The interview uses computer-assisted interviewing to in-
crease the likelihood of valid respondent reports of substance
use behaviors.31,32 Sociodemographic questions are adminis-
tered by interviewers using computer-assisted personal inter-
viewing. Other questions of a sensitive nature (substance use,
substance-related disorders, and health) are administered using
audio computer­assisted self-interviewing, which provides re-
spondents with a highly confidential means of responding to
questions to increase honest reporting of sensitive behaviors.
Respondents read questions on the computer screen, or ques-
tions are read to them through headphones, and they enter re-
sponses directly into a computer provided by the interviewer.
From 2005 to 2008, approximately 67 500 unique persons
aged 12 years or older were interviewed annually (weighted in-
terviewing response rates for adolescents aged 12-17 years,
85%-87%).31,32 This study examined adolescents aged 12 to 17
years (18 678 in 2005, 18 314 in 2006, 17 727 in 2007, and
17 842 in 2008). Four years of data (n=72 561) were pooled
to allow the detection of differences in substance-related dis-
orders among racial/ethnic groups.
STUDY VARIABLES
Substance Use
The survey asked each respondent about his or her use of al-
cohol and 9 drug classes (inhalant use and illicit use of mari-
juana or hashish, cocaine or crack, hallucinogens, or heroin,
as well as nonmedical use of prescription analgesic opioids,
stimulants or amphetamines, sedatives, or tranquilizers). Non-
medical use was defined as the use without a prescription or
for the experience or feeling the drugs caused; the use of over-
the-counter drugs and legitimate use of prescription drugs were
excluded.22,31,32 Alcohol and drug classes were assessed by dis-
crete questions in 10 different sections. Each included a de-
tailed description of the substance class and a list of sub-
stances belonging to the class. For nonmedical use, respondents
were provided with pill cards showing color pictures of tablets
for analgesic opioids, stimulants, sedatives, or tranquilizers (the
computer screen prompts the respondent to obtain pill cards
from the interviewer). To determine the extent of co-use of
alcohol and drugs, users of both alcohol and a drug were
categorized.
DSM-IV Substance-Related Disorders
(Abuse and Dependence)
Respondents who reported alcohol or drug use in the past year
were asked a set of structured substance-specific questions de-
signed to operationalize DSM-IV criteria for abuse (role inter-
ference, hazardous use, problems with the law, and relation-
ship problems) and dependence (tolerance, withdrawal, taking
larger amounts or taking them for longer periods, inability to
cut down, time spent using the substance, giving up activities,
and continued use despite problems) in the past year.20,31,32 De-
pendence on a given substance class included users who met
at least 3 dependence criteria for that class in the past year. Abuse
applied to users who met at least 1 abuse criterion but did not
meet criteria for dependence on that substance class; abuse and
dependence were mutually exclusive.20,31,32 Assessments were
adopted from questions used in the National Comorbidity Sur-
vey; as part of an ongoing process to improve the survey, di-
agnostic questions were cognitively tested to determine how
well they were understood by respondents, were evaluated by
experts to determine how well the questions captured the
DSM-IV criteria, and were modified for DSM-IV criteria.34 The
substance-related disorder questions were implemented and as-
sessed using the computer-assisted self-interviewing method.
Sociodemographics
Examined were adolescents' age, sex, family income, popula-
tion density of residence, self-rated health, and self-reported
race/ethnicity (59.9% white, 18.2% Hispanic, 15.3% African
American, 4.4% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.7% multiple race/
ethnicity, and 0.6% Native American [American Indian or Alaska
Native]).12,26-30,32 Population density was based on 2000 Cen-
sus data and the June 2003 Core-Based Statistical Area classi-
fications and was categorized as large metropolitan (1 mil-
lion population), small metropolitan (1 million population),
or nonmetropolitan (not in a Core-Based Statistical Area). Ow-
ing to the nature of a national sample, population density of
residence (a proxy for community location) was included as a
control variable. Self-rated health (fair or poor vs excellent, very
good, or good) was assessed using a widely supported mea-
sure of general health ("Would you say your health, in gen-
eral, is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?").28-30
DATA ANALYSIS
The distributions of race/ethnicity by survey year and racial/
ethnic differences in sociodemographics were determined by
2 test. The prevalence rates of substance use and substance-
related disorders by race/ethnicity were determined. The con-
ditional prevalence rates of substance-related disorders among
adolescent users of each substance class were compared by race/
ethnicity. To evaluate conditional rates of substance-related dis-
orders among substance users, the frequency of substance use
among past-year users was calculated. Logistic regression analy-
ses estimated associations between race/ethnicity and each sub-
stance-related disorder among adolescent users of that sub-
stance. Age, sex, family income, population density of residence,
self-rated health, and survey year were adjusted in the analy-
ses to mitigate for their confounding effects on associations be-
tween race/ethnicity and each substance-related disor-
der.10,12,26-30 Analyses were conducted using commercially
available software (SUDAAN, Release 9.0; Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), consider-
ing the complex designs, such as weighting and clustering, of
the NSDUH.35 All results are weighted except for sample sizes
(unweighted).
RESULTS
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
There were no yearly differences in the distribution of
racial/ethnic groups among 72 561 adolescents. Com-
pared with other racial/ethnic groups, more adolescents
aged 12 to 13 years were among Hispanics and among
those of multiple race/ethnicity (eTable 1; http://www

(63.8%), Hispanics (56.7%), and Native Americans
(56.2%) were in the lowest annual income group
($40 000) compared with other racial/ethnic groups
(range, 25.7%-37.7%) (eTable 1). Most Asians or Pa-
cific Islanders (75.9%), African Americans (63.8%), and
Hispanics (63.5%) resided in large metropolitan areas,
while Native Americans were more likely to reside in non-
metropolitan areas (34.4%). More Native Americans
(6.8%), African Americans (4.9%), and Hispanics (4.9%)
reported poor or fair health than adolescents of white race/
ethnicity (3.1%).
PREVALENCE OF SUBSTANCE USE
Overall, 37.0% (n=27 705) of adolescents used alcohol
or drugs in the past year (32% any alcohol, 19% any
illicit or nonmedical drugs, and 15% alcohol and
drugs). Of all drug classes, the use of marijuana (13% of
all adolescents) or analgesic opioids (7%) was more
prevalent than the use of other drugs (range, 0.1%-4%).
Native Americans had the highest prevalence of
substance-related use (47.5%); Native Americans
(20.5%), adolescents of multiple race/ethnicity (18.1%),
and adolescents of white race/ethnicity (16.2%) had a
higher prevalence of using both alcohol and drugs than
other groups (Table). For all racial/ethnic groups,
there was an age-related increase in alcohol or drug use
(eTable 2).
PREVALENCE
OF SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS
Among all adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, 7.9% (n=6166)
met criteria for a substance-related disorder, and 2.0%
met criteria for both substance-related disorders in the
past year (5.4% any alcohol use disorder and 4.6% any
drug use disorder). Marijuana (3.4%) and analgesic opi-
oid (1.2%) use disorders were the most prevalent drug
use disorders. The prevalence of various substance-
related disorders is summarized in eTable 3. Native Ameri-
cans had the highest prevalence of substance-related dis-
order (15.0%), followed by adolescents of multiple race/
ethnicity (9.2%), adolescents of white race/ethnicity
(9.0%), Hispanics (7.7%), African Americans (5.0%), and
Asians or Pacific Islanders (3.5%) (Figure 1).
CONDITIONAL PREVALENCE
OF SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS
AMONG SUBSTANCE USERS
Conditional rates of substance-related disorders (the
prevalence of substance-related disorders among users
of the corresponding substance), suggesting the
substance-specific liability for having a substance-
related disorder among users, showed that 21.5% of
past-year alcohol or drug users met criteria for a
substance-related disorder (Figure 2). Marijuana
(25.9% of marijuana users), heroin (26.4%), cocaine
(23.4%), and sedative (22.8%) use demonstrated simi-
larly high conditional rates. Among alcohol users,
16.7% had an alcohol use disorder.
Substance-specific frequency of use helps in inter-
preting conditional rates (Figure 3). Marijuana users
on average spent the highest mean number of days per
year using the drug (79 days), followed by stimulant us-
ers (47 days), analgesic opioid users (39 days), alcohol
users (36 days), sedative users (35 days), heroin users
(33 days), tranquilizer users (33 days), cocaine users (31
days), inhalant users (29 days), and hallucinogen users
(20 days). Substance-specific frequency of use by race/
ethnicity is summarized in eTable 4.

Native Americans (31.5%) and adolescents of multiple
race/ethnicity (25.2%) exhibited comparatively high con-
ditional rates of any substance-related disorder
(Figure 4). Native American users had a higher condi-
tional rate of any substance-related disorder than ado-
lescents of white race/ethnicity (22.9%), Hispanics
(21.0%), African Americans (15.5%), and Asians or Pa-
cific Islanders (14.9%). Adolescents of multiple race/
ethnicity (19.4%), Hispanics (16.2%), and adolescents
of white race/ethnicity (14.3%) had higher conditional
rates of comorbid alcohol and drug use disorders than
African Americans (8.3%).
CONDITIONAL PREVALENCE OF ABUSE VS
DEPENDENCE AMONG SUBSTANCE USERS
In response to recent findings showing that nonwhite
adults are more likely than those of white race/ethnicity
to have dependence than abuse,36 conditional rates of
abuse were distinguished from conditional rates of de-
pendence to discern whether dependence disproportion-
ately affected adolescents of nonwhite race/ethnicity
(eTable 6). Among alcohol users, a higher prevalence of
alcohol abuse vs alcohol dependence was more com-
mon among adolescents of white race/ethnicity (11.4%

vs 6.5%, P.05) and Hispanics (10.4% vs 6.7%, P.05).
Among any drug users, Asians or Pacific Islanders (12.8%
vs 4.3%, P.05) and adolescents of multiple race/
ethnicity (18.4% vs 8.9%, P.05) were more likely to
have drug dependence vs drug abuse. White inhalant us-
ers were more likely to have inhalant abuse than inhal-
ant dependence (6.5% vs 3.2%, P.05). Given the scar-
city of information about substance-using adolescents of
multiple race/ethnicity, their sociodemographic charac-
teristics were explored (eTable 7).
ADJUSTED ODDS RATIOS
OF SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS
AMONG SUBSTANCE USERS
Logistic regression analyses were conducted to deter-
mine whether substance-using adolescents of white race/
ethnicity, Native Americans, adolescents of multiple race/
ethnicity, or Hispanics showed a higher likelihood of
having substance-related disorders than substance-
using African Americans, adjusting for age, sex, family
income, population density of residence, self-rated health,
and survey year (eTable 8). Adolescents of white race/
ethnicity, Native Americans, adolescents of multiple race/
ethnicity, and Hispanics had greater odds than African
Americans of having alcohol, any drug, and comorbid al-
cohol and drug use disorders (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]
range, 1.35-3.36). Multiple-race adolescents (aOR, 2.42;
95% CI, 1.21-4.81), adolescents of white race/ethnicity
(1.46; 1.02-2.07), and Hispanics (1.63; 1.07-2.49) also
had greater odds than African Americans of having an
analgesic opioid use disorder. Compared with those aged
16 to 17 years, these analyses also showed an age-
related increase in alcohol use disorders (aOR, 0.45; 95%
CI, 0.37-0.54 for ages 12-13 years; and 0.72; 0.66-0.79
for ages 14-15 years) and any drug use disorders (0.36,
0.29-0.44 for ages 12-13 years; and 0.83; 0.74-0.93 for
ages 14-15 years). Poor or fair health was associated with
increased odds of any substance-related disorder (aOR,
1.60; 95% CI, 1.39-1.86), comorbid alcohol and drug dis-
orders (1.36; 1.09-1.70), or any drug use disorder (1.69;
1.44-2.00). Large metropolitan residence was associ-
ated with reduced odds of alcohol use disorders com-
pared with nonmetropolitan residence (aOR, 0.83; 95%
CI, 0.70-0.99).
Finally, we explored whether the association be-
tween race/ethnicity and substance-related disorder might
be influenced by differences in frequency of use across
racial/ethnic groups by adjusting the frequency of use of
the corresponding substance for each model. All results
showed minimal changes on aORs.
COMMENT
This study documents national estimates of past-year sub-
stance-related disorders among adolescents aged 12 to
17 years. The findings should prove useful to con-
cerned citizens, health professionals, researchers, and
health policy experts. First, past-year alcohol or drug use
is widespread (37.0%), and about 1 in 12 adolescents self-
reported having a substance-related disorder, with Na-
tive Americans showing the highest prevalence of use and
disorders. Second, analgesic opioids have replaced in-
halants as the second most commonly used drug (fol-
lowing marijuana), and analgesic opioid use disorders
comprise the second most prevalent illicit drug use dis-
order. Third, close to one-fourth of adolescent alcohol
or drug users met DSM-IV criteria for a substance-
related disorder, and users of marijuana, heroin, co-
caine, or sedatives showed an elevated rate of abuse or
dependence on these drugs. Fourth, adolescents used
marijuana more frequently than alcohol or other drugs.
Fifth, adolescents of Native American, white, Hispanic,
and multiple race/ethnicity are disproportionately af-
fected by substance-related disorders.

HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE-RELATED
DISORDERS AMONG ADOLESCENTS
OF NATIVE AMERICAN, WHITE, HISPANIC,
AND MULTIPLE RACE/ETHNICITY
Prior school-based investigations have not assessed sub-
stance-related disorders; prescription drug problems were
not a major concern, and data for adolescents of mul-
tiple race/ethnicity were unavailable.17,18,37 The growing
sizes of racial/ethnic groups, plus the elevated rate of pre-
scription drug use problems, necessitate updated and sys-
tematic research to discern intervention needs across these
groups.11,13,38 This study expands on earlier studies by in-
cluding school dropouts and adolescents of multiple race/
ethnicity, examining substance-related disorders to im-
prove measures of substance use burden, and presenting
new data on all available substance-related disorders to
make direct comparisons of indicators of intervention
needs across racial/ethnic groups. In addition to sup-
porting a high prevalence of substance use among those
of Native Americans, white, and Hispanic race/
ethnicity,17,18,37 adolescents of multiple race/ethnicity were
found to have the second highest prevalence of alcohol
use (following those of white race/ethnicity) and any drug
use (following Native Americans). Close to one-tenth of
adolescents of multiple race/ethnicity self-reported hav-
ing a substance-related disorder, and one-fourth of sub-
stance-using adolescents of multiple race/ethnicity ex-
hibited a substance-related disorder. These estimates were
as high as those for adolescents of Native American, white,
and Hispanic race/ethnicity. These 4 groups are dispro-
portionately affected by symptoms of substance-related
disorders.
When distinguishing abuse from dependence,36 drug-
using adolescents of multiple race/ethnicity exhibited a
higher prevalence of dependence than abuse, suggest-
ing that substance use problems could be a unique chal-
lenge for research and intervention as this population
grows.11,12 While substance use is influenced by mul-
tiple peer, individual (depression and delinquency), fam-
ily (poor parenting), school (location), and community
(neighborhood deterioration) domains,39-42 research also
has identified cultural-specific risk (greater accultura-
tion) and protective correlates (cultural pride and ethnic/
racial identity) for substance use, suggesting that cultural-
specific issues should be addressed for interventions to
be effective.13,14,43-45 However, cultural-related factors have
yet to be investigated for adolescents of multiple race/
ethnicity. About 2% of the US population are of mul-
tiple race/ethnicity, which includes 3 subgroups of simi-
lar size (white and African American, white and Native
American, and white and Asian or Pacific Islander) and
a small subgroup self-identifying themselves as more than
3 races/ethnicities.46 Heterogeneous cultural back-
grounds of individuals of multiple race/ethnicity empha-
size the need for multidisciplinary approaches to disen-
tangle cultural related factors that can guide prevention
and treatment.12,14,47
NATIVE AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS
REQUIRE CONCERTED RESEARCH AND
INTERVENTION EFFORTS
Another concern is the high rate of substance-related dis-
orders among Native Americans. Consistent with ear-
lier studies,17,37,48 Native Americans showed the highest
prevalence of substance-related use (47.5%). Native
Americans also demonstrated the highest rate of sub-
stance-related disorder (15.0%); among past-year sub-
stance-using Native Americans, 31.5% met criteria for a
substance-related disorder. In a sample of 651 indig-
enous adolescents from a single culture in the northern
United States and Canada aged 13 to 15 years, Whit-
beck et al49 found that 12.7% self-reported having a past-
year alcohol use disorder, and 15.4% had a past-year mari-
juana use disorder. However, there is a scarcity of research
on young Native Americans who obtain addiction treat-
ment.50 Given that this population is generally younger
(39% are 20 years) and poorer than other ethnic/
racial groups,51 young Native Americans have great need
for intervention to reduce burdens from substance use.
There are 562 federally recognized American Indian tribes
in the United States; the cultural diversity and geo-
graphic dispersion of these tribes have important impli-
cations for research and service provision, requiring policy
support to develop culturally appropriate interventions
to improve their health.52-54
MARIJUANA AND ANALGESIC OPIOIDS
CONSTITUTE THE PRIMARY DRUGS OF ABUSE
The results also support rising concerns about adoles-
cent marijuana use.25 Marijuana use disorders consti-
tuted 74.0% of all illicit or nonmedical substance-
related disorders, and 25.9% of marijuana users exhibited
a marijuana use disorder, which (along with heroin, co-
caine, and sedatives) represented the highest condi-
tional rate of substance-related disorders. The high rate
can be related to frequency of use, as marijuana users (on
average) spent the most days using the drug compared
with other substance users. This is the first known study
to present such findings for all substance classes, and it
reveals cause for concern owing to the large number of
past-year marijuana users (13.0% of all adolescents), a
recent increase in marijuana use, increased levels of mari-

juana potency, and potential adverse effects on adoles-
cents' health and subsequent productivity.24,25,55,56 Re-
search is needed to closely monitor marijuana use and
associated disorders among adolescents and identify pre-
vention programs that truly work.
Lastly, analgesic opioids constitute the second most
commonly used illicit drug among all racial/ethnic groups,
with adolescents of Native American, white, and mul-
tiple race/ethnicity showing comparatively high rates of
use. The large sample helped identify analgesic opioid-
using adolescents of these racial/ethnic groups exhibit-
ing elevated odds of analgesic opioid use disorders. Com-
pared with results from earlier studies,17,37,48 findings
herein support an elevated rate of nonmedical analgesic
opioid use and analgesic opioid-related problems across
various racial/ethnic groups. This finding is consistent
with evidence showing that one-fourth of users of non-
medical analgesic opioids aged 12 to 17 years had never
used other illicit or nonmedical drugs22 and that adoles-
cents have generally considered analgesic opioids safer
and easier to get than illicit drugs, and reported parents'
medicine cabinets, family members, or friends as pri-
mary sources.57,58 Unfortunately, analgesic opioids are
among the most addictive and lethal drugs when used
improperly.59,60 Clearly, educational or prevention inter-
ventions should incorporate effective messages about
health risk for nonmedical use or abuse of prescription
drugs, and screening for nonmedical drug use should be
considered for high-risk adolescents.
LIMITATIONS AND STRENGTHS
These findings should be interpreted with caution. The
NSDUH relies on self-reports, which can be influenced
by memory error and underreporting. As in other sur-
veys, substance-related disorders are surveyed in the
NSDUH based on standardized questions designed to op-
erationalize DSM-IV criteria for substance-related disor-
ders; these rates are self-reported estimates, not clinical
diagnoses. Of note, the NSDUH-based past-year 6.7%
prevalenceofsubstance-relateddisorders(alcoholordrug)
among adults in 2000 resembled the 7.4% prevalence of
substance-related disorders among adults in the Na-
tional Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey.34 Find-
ings also do not apply to institutionalized or homeless
adolescents, who were not included in the NSDUH. Nico-
tine dependence is excluded because it was not based on
DSM-IV criteria; hence, adolescents' substance-related dis-
order problems are greater than our findings have sug-
gested. This study also does not address the influence of
community-level poverty or intraethnic differences (eg,
differences among Hispanic groups) in substance-
related disorders, as detailed measures are unavail-
able.13,39,43,61 Given the increasing cultural diversity of the
US population, the availability of data sets for specific ra-
cial/ethnic groups and community-level poverty in fu-
ture NSDUH would make it possible to monitor dispari-
ties in substance-related disorders for heterogeneous
racial/ethnic groups.
The NSDUH also has noteworthy strengths. These re-
sults have a higher level of generalizability than those of
a regional sample owing to high response rates and the
large sample consisting of students and nonstudents or
school dropouts. The 3.8% proportion of nonstudents or
school dropouts among adolescents aged 16 to 17 years
in this sample was similar to the 3.9% proportion of drop-
outs among US public high school students.62 While the
US Census does not provide detailed information about
racial/ethnic groups for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years,
this study's distributions resemble those of all ages in the
United States among groups of Native American (0.6%
vs 0.7%), Asian or Pacific Islander (4.4% vs 4.4%), and
multiple (1.7% vs 1.6%) race/ethnicity.46
Furthermore, based on continuous research efforts and
enhancements to improve national substance-related dis-
order estimates, the NSDUH uses the most sophisti-
cated survey methods available to improve the quality
of self-reported data (detailed probes, color pictures of
prescription drugs to augment assessments for sub-
stance use, and computer-assisted self-administration in-
terviewing and anonymous data collection to enhance
privacy).31 A large reliability study63 found substantial (for
abuse or dependence questions) to almost perfect (for
cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use questions) re-
sponse agreement for key NSDUH measures; another
NSDUH validity study64 revealed high agreement be-
tween self-reported use and urine drug test results (84.6%
for tobacco, 89.8% for marijuana, and 95.5% for co-
caine). The trend data of the NSDUH on various drug
use patterns among adolescents are remarkably consis-
tent with trend data from Monitoring the Future.10,31 Given
the growing diversity and size of the young population
and the scarcity of substance-related disorder indica-
tors, this study makes a unique contribution by provid-
ing new information to elucidate the magnitude of il-
licit and prescription drug use disorders for understudied
Asians or Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, Hispan-
ics, and African Americans.
CONCLUSIONS
Native Americans have the highest prevalence of sub-
stance use and substance-related disorders, adding to evi-
dence that young Native Americans are a vulnerable group
facing numerous stressors, trauma, and health dispari-
ties (eg, highest rate of suicide, underfunded systems of
care, and lack of access to appropriate care).65 The re-
sults herein highlight a critical need for intervention to
reduce their burdens from substance use and for poli-
cies to address presently underfunded systems of care and
improve infrastructures linking behavioral and primary
health care services.54,65 In addition, high rates of sub-
stance use and substance-related disorders among ado-
lescents of multiple race/ethnicity provide a rationale for
including them in research analysis and reporting find-
ings as appropriate. Furthermore, while health care pro-
viders who regularly see adolescents for periodic check-
ups can have a critical role in screening for substance use
and early intervention, substantial barriers to recom-
mended practices exist, and research is needed to iden-
tify incentives and means to promote screening and timely
intervention.66,67 Finally, many addiction treatment pro-
grams either exclude adolescents from treatment (eg, pro-

gram policies) or integrate adolescents into programs serv-
ing adults. Even within adolescent-specific programs, key
elements for effective treatment are often inadequately
addressed, and a lack of cultural competence is identi-
fied as a major gap, as insensitivity to cultural differ-
ences can limit the ability to treat and retain minority
adolescents.14,68-70 Taken together, these findings call for
efforts to identify and expand prevention measures that
are culturally effective and address the quality and ac-
ceptability of treatment for adolescents with substance
use problems.67,70
