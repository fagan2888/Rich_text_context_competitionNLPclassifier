Introduction
In the last several yearsAmazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
has surged in popularity in experimental and survey-based
social science research (Berinsky et al., 2012; Chandler
et al., 2014; Krupnikov and Levine, 2014; Paolacci and
Chandler, 2014). Researchers have used the results from
MTurk surveys to answer a wide array of questions ranging
from understanding the limitations of voters to exploring
cognitive biases and the strengths of political arguments
(Arceneaux, 2012; Grimmer et al., 2012; Huber et al., 2012).
As this type of work has grown in popularity, researchers
hear an increasing number of important questions at work-
shops and conferences about the external validity of the
inferences made drawing upon MTurk samples. Questions
such as: "Are your respondents all young White males?",
"Do any of them have jobs?" and "Where do these people
live?" are rightfully voiced. In this paper we seek to answer
some of these questions by unpacking the survey-specific
respondent attributes of MTurk samples.
Berinsky et al. (2012) take an important first step in
exploring the validity of experiments performed using
MTurk. They show that while respondents recruited via
MTurk are often more representative of the US population
than in-person convenience samples, MTurk respondents
are less representative than subjects in Internet-based pan-
els or national probability samples. Berinsky et al. (2012)
reach this conclusion by comparing MTurk to convenience
samples from prior work (Berinsky and Kinder, 2006; Kam
et al., 2007) and the American National Election 2008­
2009 Panel Study. In their paper, Berinsky et al. (2012)
assess numerous characteristics of MTurk respondents that
are of interest to political scientists. These variables include
"Who are these people?" Evaluating

and political preferences of MTurk

Abstract
As Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has surged in popularity throughout political science, scholars have increasingly
challenged the external validity of inferences made drawing upon MTurk samples. At workshops and conferences
experimental and survey-based researchers hear questions about the demographic characteristics, political preferences,
occupation, and geographic location of MTurk respondents. In this paper we answer these questions and present a
number of novel results. By introducing a new benchmark comparison for MTurk surveys, the Cooperative Congressional
Election Survey, we compare the joint distributions of age, gender, and race among MTurk respondents within the
United States. In addition, we compare political, occupational, and geographical information about respondents from
MTurk and CCES. Throughout the paper we show several ways that political scientists can use the strengths of MTurk
to attract respondents with specific characteristics of interest to best answer their substantive research questions.

party identification, race, education, age, marital status,
religion, as well as numerous other variables of interest.
The comparisons presented by Berinsky et al. (2012) pro-
vide an excellent foundation for exploring the relationship
between samples drawn from MTurk surveys and other
subject pools commonly used by political scientists.1
In this paper we present a number of results that contrib-
ute to a broader goal of understanding survey data collected
from platforms such as MTurk. In doing so we provide a
framework that will allow social science researchers, who
frequently use this platform, to better understand the charac-
teristics of their respondent pools and the implications of
this for their research. This paper builds upon Berinsky et al.
(2012) to make four contributions. First, in Section 2 we
present a new benchmark comparison for MTurk surveys:
the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey (CCES).2,3
The CCES is a nationally stratified sample survey adminis-
tered yearly from late September to late October. The survey
asks about general political attitudes, demographic factors,
assessment of roll call voting choices, and political informa-
tion.4 In this paper we present the results of a simultaneous
MTurk and CCES survey.5,6 Unlike in Berinsky et al. (2012),
this design allows us to focus our comparisons on the simi-
larities and differences between CCES and MTurk samples
at a common point in time.
Second, we provide a partial picture of the joint distribu-
tions of a number of demographic characteristics of interest
to social science researchers. Berinsky et al. (2012) take an
important first step toward understanding the racial, gender,
and age characteristics of MTurk samples by reporting the
percentage of respondents in each of these categories.
However, they do not explore the relationship between these
key variables of interest. By presenting the joint distribu-
tions of several of these variables we are able to analyze the
properties of MTurk samples within the United States as
they cut across these different categories. For example, we
show that MTurk is excellent at attracting young Hispanic
females and young Asian males and females. In contrast,
MTurk has trouble recruiting most older racial categories
and is particularly poor at attracting African Americans. We
focus on race, gender, and age as these are some of the most
prominent attributes of respondents across which research-
ers might expect to observe heterogeneous treatment
effects.7 This means that providing information about the
number of respondents within each of these categories of
interest, and how this differs from other prominent survey
platforms, can assist researchers in both the design and
interpretation of their experimental results.
Third, we compare the political characteristics of
respondents on MTurk and CCES. In Section 3 we show
how the age of respondents interacts with voting patterns,
partisan preferences, news interest, and education.8 We
demonstrate that, on average, the estimated difference
between CCES and MTurk markedly decreases when we
subset the data to younger individuals. In Section 4, we
compare the occupations of MTurk and CCES respond-
ents. We show that the percentage of respondents employed
in a specific sector is similar across both platforms, with a
maximum difference of less than 7%. For example, the
percentage of respondents employed as "Professionals" is
in the range of approximately 12­16% across both sur-
veys. These results show that MTurk and CCES have a
similar proportion of respondents across industry. In
Section 5, we present geographic information about
respondents. We show that the number of respondents liv-
ing in different geographic categories on the rural­urban
continuum is almost identical in MTurk and CCES. Both
MTurk and CCES draw approximately 90% of their
respondents from urban areas. Using geographic data from
the surveys, we map the county-level distribution of
respondents across the country.
Finally, we discuss how researchers can build "pools" of
prior MTurk respondents, recontact these respondents
using the open-source R package MTurkR,9 and then use
these pools to over-sample and stratify to create samples
that have desired distributions of covariates. This is a useful
tool for social science researchers because it allows them to
directly stratify on key moderating variables.10 By drawing
on the strengths and weaknesses of MTurk samples and
cutting-edge research tools such as MTurkR, researchers
can use similar sampling strategies to those of professional
polling firms to directly address concerns about the exter-
nal validity of their survey research.
Age, gender, and race: exploring the
joint distributions of key demographic
characteristics
In this section we compare distributions of basic demo-
graphic variables in a CCES team survey11 and a survey
conducted on MTurk at the same time during the fall of
2012. The MTurk survey had 2706 respondents and the
CCES had 1300. The questions in both surveys were asked
in the exact same ways, though the CCES survey respond-
ents were also asked additional questions.12
Obtaining a survey sample with the desired racial, age,
or gender characteristics is a difficult endeavor that has per-
sistently challenged the external validity of research. For
example, scholars have frequently debated the quality of
inferences when the results are drawn from college-age
convenience samples (Druckman and Kam, 2011; Peterson,
2001). Some argue that research must be replicated with
non-student subjects before attempting to make generaliza-
tions. Experimentalists push back and invite arguments
about why a particular covariate imbalance would moder-
ate a treatment effect. We argue in this paper that insofar as
this debate plays out with respect to MTurk, we should
have detailed information about what exact covariate
imbalances actually exist.
Huff and Tingley 3
In the survey research tradition there are a variety of
methods for achieving a "nationally" representative poll.
For example, the CCES creates a nationally representative
sample of US adults using approximate sample weights
from sample matching on registered and unregistered vot-
ers. This means that in order to generalize to the target pop-
ulation of US adults the CCES must weight respondents
with certain background characteristics more heavily than
others.13 Figure 1 shows the survey weights placed on indi-
viduals in different age brackets. The results demonstrate
how the CCES up-weights younger individuals while
down-weighting older individuals.14 The cutpoint for age is
found by taking the mean of all the data (including CCES
and MTurk). This method is used since we want to directly
compare individuals in the different age categories across
MTurk and CCES. The results do not change when using
other similar cutpoints. In the remainder of the paper we
will not use the CCES survey weights.15 Individuals could
always construct weights for MTurk samples. By ignoring
weights we get to observe the underlying differences in the
unweighted samples.
In Figure 2 we get a sense of the joint distributions of
three key variables: age, gender, and race. The mosaic plots
show, for each racial category, the proportion of respondents
that are male or female and young or old. For example, the
first row of mosaic plots show for individuals of all races,
the proportion that are older females, older males, younger
females, and younger males. If the width of a box under
female is larger than for male, this means that there is a large
proportion of females within that particular race. Similarly,
if a box is taller for younger than for older individuals, this
means that there is a larger proportion of younger than older
individuals of a particular race represented in the sample.
Figure 2 demonstrates that the young individuals
weighted most heavily by CCES are often the same catego-
ries that MTurk was best at attracting.16 We can see that
approximately 75% of all respondents in CCES and MTurk
were White. Figure 2 also demonstrates differences in the
CCES and MTurk samples with respect to African
American, Hispanic, and Asian respondents. For example,
MTurk is able to attract between 2% and 5% more Hispanic
and Asian respondents.17 In contrast, CCES is approxi-
mately 6% better at recruiting African-American respond-
ents. We can take this analysis a step further by exploring
the joint distributions of age, gender, and race. For exam-
ple, we can see that in all racial categories MTurk attracts a
large number of young respondents with this contrast at its
starkest among young Asian males.18
Researchers could leverage the differential abilities of
survey pools to attract respondents with demographic char-
acteristics most suited to answering their theoretical ques-
tion of interest.19 Just as scholars select the methodological
tools most suited to addressing their question, the same
logic can be applied to choosing between survey pools.
Recognizing the differential abilities of MTurk and CCES
to recruit specific individuals of particular demographic
characteristics is an important step. For example, Figure 2
demonstrates that MTurk is an excellent resource for
exploring the opinions of Young Asian and Hispanic Males.
However, CCES might be a better choice for exploring the
opinion of Male African-Americans. As experimental and
survey-based research continues to surge in popularity
political scientists can and should take advantage of these
strengths and weaknesses of MTurk survey pools.
Party ID, ideology, news interest,
voting, and education
In this section we explore the interaction between age and
several variables commonly used in political science
research. These include: (1) voter registration; (2) voter
intentions; (3) ideology; (4) news interest; (5) party identi-
fication; and (6) education. In doing so, we build upon the
work of Berinsky et al. (2012) by exploring the interaction
of these variables with age. Using regression we demon-
strate that, on average, the estimated difference between
CCES and MTurk decreases when we subset the data to
younger individuals. This means that when researchers are
considering the dimensions along which they might expect
to find heterogeneous treatment effects they should be cog-
nizant of the ways in which older respondents differ across
survey platforms. The regression estimates with standard
errors are presented in Figure 3.20
Figure 3 depicts several differences across the two sur-
vey platforms. First, voting registration and intention to
turnout patterns among younger respondents are very simi-
lar for both CCES and MTurk. In contrast, older respond-
ents in MTurk turnout and vote less than individuals of a

similar age from the CCES. For party identification, which
was measured on a seven-point scale ranging from Strong
Democrat to Strong Republican, we again observe that
younger respondents are more similar for both CCES and
MTurk. For older individuals the respondents in MTurk are
consistently more liberal than CCES. Somewhat similar
trends hold for ideology. The level of news interest, which
varies from most of the time to hardly at all, between
respondents in MTurk and CCES varies dramatically. Older
individuals in MTurk are less interested in the news than
older individuals from CCES. In contrast, younger MTurk
respondents are more interested in the news than younger
individuals from CCES. Finally, we can see that there are
not substantial differences in the levels of education between
younger and older MTurk and CCES respondents.
We can draw a number of conclusions from these
results. First, the similar registration and intention to vote
patterns of CCES and MTurk respondents shows that

MTurk could be an excellent means for exploring how
experimental manipulations could influence voting ten-
dencies. As we showed in the previous section, these
manipulations could be targeted at particular demographic
groups such as young Hispanic or Asian respondents.
Second, MTurk provides a useful means for attracting
young respondents interested in the news. This means that
MTurk could be used by political scientists to build upon
prior research exploring the complex relationship between
news interest, political knowledge, and voter turnout
(Philpot, 2004; Prior, 2005; Zaller, 1992). The regression
results presented in Figure 3 provide a means for political
scientists to more fully understanding the external validity
of MTurk surveys and also showing the strengths of MTurk
for exploring a number of substantive questions of interest
to political science researchers.
What do they do? The occupations of
MTurk respondents
One of the most common questions we hear at workshops
and conferences is about the occupational categories of
MTurk respondents. Many scholars are rightfully con-
cerned that MTurk respondents might all be unemployed
or overwhelmingly draw from a small number of indus-
tries. Depending on the particular research question, these
differences could interact with our experimental manipula-
tions in significant ways. Thus, the occupation of MTurk
respondents would be fundamentally different from that of
other sectors of the population about which they are trying
to make inferences. However, in this paper we show that
the percentage of MTurk respondents employed in specific
industries is strikingly similar to CCES.21 For example, we
can see that the percentage of individuals employed as
Professionals ranges from approximately 12% to 16% for
CCES and MTurk. Indeed, in the 14 sector-specific occu-
pation categories we compare the maximum difference
between MTurk and CCES is less than 6%. We can see this
difference in the "Other Service" sector of Table 1 where
16.01% of individuals are employed in "Other Service" in
MTurk while there are 21.47% in CCES.22 The results pre-
sented in Table 1 should be reassuring to political scientists
concerned that the occupation of MTurk respondents is
fundamentally different than other survey pools. Table 1

for older respondents and solid lines for younger.

demonstrates the occupational similarities between MTurk
and CCES.
Where do respondents live? The
urban­rural continuum
Researchers might also be concerned that MTurk respond-
ents are overwhelmingly drawn from either urban or rural
areas. This, again, may or may not matter for estimating the
effect of an experimental manipulation depending on the
research question, but as with employment characteristics it
is useful to know. In both the MTurk and CCES data we
have self-reported zip codes. We then link this data up with
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
rural­urban continuum classification scheme to analyze the
geographic characteristics of survey respondents.23 These
classification codes range from metro areas coded 1­3 in
decreasing population size, to non-metro areas coded from
4 to 9. In Table 2 we show that the number of respondents
living in different geographic categories on the rural-urban
continuum is almost identical in MTurk and CCES.24 Both
MTurk and CCES draw approximately 90% of their
respondents from urban areas with the remaining 10%
spread across rural areas. For example, we can see that
between 52% and 57% of respondents have a rural-urban
code of 1 which means they live in counties in metro areas
of 1 million or more. In contrast, less than 2% of respond-
ents have a rural-urban code of 9 meaning that they live in
a location that is completely rural. The rural-urban com-
parison of CCES and MTurk is presented in Table 2.
Table 2 shows that MTurk and CCES respondents live in
similar geographic locations on the rural-urban continuum.
This means that social science researchers should not be
concerned that MTurk respondents are overwhelmingly
drawn from either urban or rural areas in a way that might
bias their results, compared to what they would get from a
major professional polling firm. In Appendix B we present
a map showing the distribution of respondents at the county
level in the MTurk sample across the United States (Figure
5). Political scientists can explore the geographic distribu-
tion of their respondents using this paper's replication files
cross applied to their own studies. If, for example, an over-
whelming number of respondents are drawn from a particu-
lar state or county we will be able to view this on the map.
The similarities between the occupation and rural-urban
location of respondents from MTurk and CCES has impli-
cations for experimental and survey-based research. For
example, political economists exploring preferences over
trade, immigration, and redistribution, for which occupa-
tion and location are of critical importance, can consider
using MTurk and not be concerned that their respondents
are overwhelmingly drawn from particular occupations or
geographic locations that look different from what profes-
sional poll sampling would yield. These results provide a
first response to questions frequently raised at workshops
and conferences about whether the geographic and employ-
ment characteristics of MTurk respondents are fundamen-
tally different from other survey pools.
Developing survey pools
Researchers can use MTurk to build "pools" of prior MTurk
respondents that they can then use in several different ways
for future surveys. This is done by first having a MTurk
respondent take a survey where the researcher records vari-
ables of interest, such as age, race, gender, and party, and
then match these characteristics to the unique identification
number possessed by every MTurk respondent. Once this
pool is developed researchers can use the open-source R
package MTurkR to recontact their prior respondents.25
MTurkR has the potential to revolutionize online experi-
mental and survey research as political scientists can use
this package for over-sampling or stratifying on crucial
variables of interest such as party or gender.
There are two main techniques researchers can use to
build pools. In the first technique, researchers can pool

across respondents from their prior MTurk surveys. Since
researchers commonly ask the same battery of questions
about the demographic characteristics of their respondents,
they can use these characteristics to then stratify on varia-
bles of interest. For example, over time, we have collected a
large pool of MTurkers that have taken our surveys and told
us their gender, ideology, partisan affiliation, and zip code.
In this sample of 15,584 MTurkers, 54% were male, on a
one- to seven-point ideology scale the average was 3.35,
34% self-identified as Democrat, 22% as Republican, and
26% as independent (the remaining identified with "other"
parties), and the average age was 32.26 This technique of
pooling across multiple surveys is most useful for research-
ers that conduct a high volume of surveys on MTurk.27
A recent strain of research exploring the characteristics
of MTurk workers argues that what differentiates MTurkers
is their status as permanent participants (Chandler et al.,
2014; Krupnikov and Levine, 2014; Paolacci and Chandler,
2014). A potential concern with permanent participants is
that they have taken a number of similar studies which can
then subsequently affect the ways in which they both answer
questions and respond to treatment conditions.28 Moreover,
the use of high-volume survey takers has the potential
to undermine some of the assumptions of experimental
research methods.29 We view the ability to build pools of
respondents as a way to potentially address this concern.30
Since researchers that build pools have data on the number
of times an individual has taken their prior surveys, they
could build information into their pool about the types of
respondents that are "high-volume" takers and then test for
heterogeneous treatment effects. The assumption here is that
respondents that take a high-volume of surveys are less
likely to be naive workers, and more likely to appear in prior
surveys with a higher frequency. Researchers can then
incorporate this information about their respondents to test
for whether treatment differentially affects MTurk workers
that have taken a higher frequency of prior surveys.
In the second technique, researchers create a pool by first
creating a HIT that oversamples respondents and asks a
small battery of questions upon which the researcher would
like to subsequently stratify. They then use this new pool to
recontact respondents with the desired attributes of interest.
This technique is useful to researchers that conduct an infre-
quent number of surveys as they have likely not built up a
pool of adequate size to be able to pool across multiple sur-
veys to directly recontact respondents. Moreover, this two-
stage sampling procedure allows researchers to recruit
respondents over a relatively short timeframe. Gay et al.
(2015) provide a concrete example of how this could be
done in practice in order to address concerns about not being
able to obtain enough non-White respondents. Using a two-
stage sampling procedure, they first recruited 1940 respond-
ents to take a demographic survey. From these 1940
respondents, they then recontacted a sample that included
all of the Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents from this
initial survey, as well as 200 randomly drawn White
respondents. This technique allowed Gay et al. (2015) to
ensure that they obtained a final sample with variation
across their theoretically motivated respondent characteris-
tics of interest.
The ability to over-sample or stratify on variables of
interest can be a useful tool for social science researchers.
For example, this has been very helpful in our research on
climate change politics because we are particularly inter-
ested in individuals who deny climate change, which is rela-
tively rare in the liberally oriented MTurk population.
Scholars can now ensure that the samples they draw from
MTurk satisfy specific criteria of their choosing. Researchers
can use this tool to ensure that they obtain a sample with a
specified number of Democrats and Republicans. Or
researchers could stratify on other questions.31 Doing so
allows the researcher to obtain larger sample sizes of other-
wise hard to reach parts of the population that likely will
respond quite differently to experimental manipulations.
This then becomes very important for being able to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects which are interesting in
their own right. Furthermore, this marks a step toward
addressing external validity criticisms of research conducted
using MTurk samples since scholars can use similar sam-
pling strategies to those used by professional polling firms.
Finally, researchers can create panel surveys by recontacting
respondents in much the same way.
Conclusion
In this paper we took a step toward answering the fre-
quently voiced question of "Who are these MTurk respond-
ents?". In doing so we presented a number of results. First,
we compared the joint distributions of key demographic
characteristics of interest to political scientists. In doing so
we analyzed they strengths and weaknesses of MTurk sam-
ples as they cut across these different categories. For exam-
ple, we showed that MTurk is relatively strong at attracting
young Hispanic females and young Asian males and
females. Second, we showed how the age of respondents
interacts with voting patterns, partisan preferences, news
interest, and education. We demonstrated that, on average,
the estimated difference between CCES and MTurk
decreased when we subset the data to younger individuals.
Fourth, we compared the occupations of respondents from
MTurk and CCES. We showed that the percentage of
respondents employed in a specific sector were very simi-
lar, with a maximum difference of less than 7%. Fifth, we
showed that the number of respondents living in different
geographic categories on the rural­urban continuum is
almost identical in MTurk and CCES. Both MTurk and
CCES draw approximately 90% of their respondents from
urban areas. Finally, we discussed how experimental politi-
cal scientists can build "pools" of prior MTurk respondents
and recontact these respondents using the open-source
8 Research and Politics 
package MTurkR. Researchers can use these pools to over-
sample and stratify to build samples that are balanced on
theoretically motivated variables of interest.
The results presented in this paper provide a number of
comparisons that could be useful for further understanding
the external validity of research relying on MTurk samples.
This is important for social science researchers when we
have strong theoretical reasons to suspect that our experi-
mental manipulations will interact with characteristics of
the sample. We provided several examples of how experi-
mental researches can leverage the strength and weaknesses
of MTurk samples to their advantage. For example, we
show that MTurk is an excellent resource for attracting
young individuals interested in the news, Hispanics and
Asian respondents, as well as individuals from a number of
industries and geographic locations in ways that parallel
other professionally supplied samples. The results demon-
strated in this paper show that there are strong reasons for
researchers to consider using MTurk to make inferences
about a number of broader populations of interest.
There are a number of takeaways from this paper that are
useful for both academics and non-academics alike. First,
MTurk is a relatively inexpensive and easy to use survey
platform that allows researchers in both academia and the
private sector to gain access to a large number of survey
respondents. This means that MTurk can serve as a "democ-
ratizing" force by allowing researchers to field surveys that
might otherwise be difficult given the high costs often asso-
ciated with professional survey firms. Second, respondents
on MTurk are not all that different from respondents on other
survey platforms. These differences are even smaller as we
focus in on certain attributes of the worker pools such as
among younger respondents. This means that researchers,
policymakers, and journalists reading work that utilizes the
MTurk platform should not immediately dismiss the research
as being fielded on a non-representative sample, but instead
think carefully about how the MTurk worker pool differs
from other platforms and how we might theoretically expect
this to affect results. Third, the ability to build survey pools
and recontact respondents with particular attributes is a use-
ful tool for anyone attempting to survey individuals with a
specific set of characteristics. This is useful for researchers in
both academia and the private sector as they attempt to gain
access to a particular set of respondents.32 As experimental
and survey-based research continues to surge in popularity it
is important that political scientists, journalists, and policy-
makers alike continue to ask and answer the important ques-
tion of "who are these people?"

Notes
 1. The interest in using voluntary labor pools for survey research
is also made evident by Berinsky et al. (2013), who looked at
the use of mechanisms for detecting "rushing through" sur-
veys. Berinsky et al. (2013) shows that as many as half of all
respondents breeze through surveys without paying attention
and that Screener passage correlates with politically relevant
characteristics, such as education and race. They present a
number of ways of overcoming this inattentiveness. This
research is parallel to ours as it is an attempt to understand
the strengths and weaknesses of new sources of survey data.
2. Berinsky et al. (2012) examine the Current Population
Survey (CPS) and American National Election Studies
(ANES). Given the expanding set of viable platforms for
survey research in political science, contrasting to the CCES
is a helpful contribution given the many publications coming
out of the CCES project. See http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/
cces/publications for examples.
3. The refusal rates 1, 2, and 3, are 0.031, 0.033, and 0.070
for CCES, respectively. For more information on the CCES
response and refusal rates see Ansolabehere (2012). Given
that we used MTurk we cannot report a response rate for this
sample.
4. The CCES occurs in two waves during election years. We
focus on the first wave since this part of the survey asks about
the political attitudes and demographic factors which are cru-
cial in assessing the quality/characteristics of the CCES and
MTurk samples.
 5. MTurk survey participants were recruited to take a short sur-
vey (10­15 questions) on political attitudes using a pay rate
of $3. We required that respondents had a previous approval
rating of at least 95% and were registered in the United
States.
6. We assume in this paper that the MTurk respondents we
compare to CCES are representative of the broader popula-
tion of MTurk respondents. To check this we compared the
demographic characteristics of the sample presented in this
paper with a second set of simultaneous MTurk respondents
recruited using a similar advertisement and found them to be
extremely similar.
7. This paper is part of a growing strain of research seeking
to understand the characteristics of the MTurk worker pool
(Chandler et al., 2014; Krupnikov and Levine, 2014; Paolacci
and Chandler, 2014; Ross et al., 2010). Understanding the
demographic characteristics and political preferences of
MTurk workers provides a useful stepping stone for further
research exploring the costs and benefits of conducting sur-
vey research on MTurk.
8. Our motivation for interacting age with other variables is
that MTurk is commonly criticized for drawing from a dif-
ferent range of ages than other survey pools. Understanding
these interactions is crucial for the continued development of
experimental political science.

gender, political party, and occupation see Fischer and Shaw
(1999), Heo et al. (2005), Dreher and Cox (2000), Philpot
(2004), Zaller (1992), and Bamundo and Kopelman (1980).
11. We obtain similar results if we analyze the collection of team
surveys which has a sample size of over 50,000 respondents.
We analyze the team survey because its sample size is more
reflective of what an individual researcher might be able to
obtain either on MTurk or through other survey sources for a
single survey.
12. This feature is unavoidable. The CCES asks a "Common
Content" section of additional questions. While our survey
asked some of these questions, we did not ask others such as
questions about the individual's own elected representatives.
13. Additionally, YouGov/Polimetrix initially draws a larger
sample than is required for the target sample size. To mini-
mize the size of the survey weights, some individuals are
excluded from the final sample.
14. It is also notable that in a sample of 1300 people there are 32
with a survey weight over 5. Compared to others in the sam-
ple, these individuals are extremely heavily weighted. Some
suggest excluding these observations from analysis.
15. Contrasts using the CCES survey weights are presented in
Appendix A.
16. These results hold across a second simultaneous sample of
CCES and MTurk respondents.
17. This percentage is calculated by dividing the total number of
individuals within a particular racial category by the number
of respondents in the sample.
18. This trend is depicted in Figure 2 by the large height of the
light gray boxes in the column on the left.
19. Researchers should use weights that are calibrated to best
represent the populations for which they are attempting to
make inferences. We recommend that when using weights
researchers present both unweighted and weighted estimates.
See Ansolabehere(2012) for how CCES approaches this
problem.
20. Regression results weighting CCES respondents are pre-
sented in Figure 4 in Appendix A.
21. These percentages are calculated within each survey by
dividing the total number of individuals employed in a par-
ticular sector by the total number of individuals in all sectors.
Table 1 shows these sector-specific percentages.
22. In a second simultaneous study comparing respondents
from MTurk and CCES the percentage of respondents
employed in "Other Services" was extremely similar at
roughly 19%.
23. The rural-urban codes can be found at http://www.ers.usda.
gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes.aspx#.
Uy7xQvldV8E. In order to calculate the proportion of
respondents in a particular urban rural code we first merged
the zip code data with FIPS codes. We then aggregated this
new dataset sorted at the FIPS level according to the urban­
rural codes.
24. The percentages are calculated for a particular sample by
dividing the number of individuals within an rural-urban
category by the number of respondents in the sample.
25. This R package, which was developed by Thomas Leeper,
provides easy access to the MTurk Requester API and a
range of functionalities Leeper(2015), Leeper(2013). Other
tools are available for a similar purposes, but this particular
package is highly developed and within a software frame-
work many political scientists know.
26. In contrast, the 2012 Common Content CCES survey had
54,535 respondents. Unweighted, 47% were male, on a one
to seven point ideology scale the average was 4.27, 37%
self-identified as Democrat, 27% as Republican, and 30% as
independent (the remaining identified with "other" parties),
and the average age was 52.
27. This might not be as useful for researchers that conduct sur-
veys infrequently due to the high turnover of respondents on
MTurk and the inability to build large pools if the researcher
does not attract a large number of respondents.
28. As noted by Paolacci and Chandler(2014) this is in part driven
by the fact that workers choose the tasks they work on. This
means that workers might have incentives to participate in
studies using procedures that they have already seen.
29. As highlighted by Chandler et al.(2014), these assumptions
include that observations are randomly assigned and inde-
pendent from each other.
30. It should be noted that this technique will only be success-
ful if what differentiates MTurk respondents from those in
other survey platforms is an observable characteristic. For
example, Krupnikov and Levine (2014) observed different
results when replicating the same experiment on MTurk
and other survey platforms even after accounting for fac-
tors such as partisanship and savviness. While we view
our paper as a step toward better understand the moderat-
ing variables that differentiate respondents on MTurk from
other survey pools, further research is needed to both theo-
rize and empirically test other potential unobserved moder-
ating variables.
31. The decision to respond to the invitation will vary by com-
pensation level. Needless to say we and others have been sat-
isfied with the experience.
32. For example, private firms could build a pool of respondents
all of whom have previously used their product, and then ask
them a targeted set of questions of interest. The ability to
build a pool and recontact respondents would allow the firm
to do this in a cost-effective way that would be difficult on
other types of survey platforms.
33. We were unable to generate maps for Alaska and Hawaii due
to technical issues with the way the maps are generated.

Appendix A: Contrasts using CCES survey weights
In Figure 4 we use regression with the CCES survey weights to contrast several key variables of interest to political sci-
entists. For the CCES respondents we use the CCES weights while the weights are set at 1 for all MTurk respondents. The
results presented in Figures 3 and 4 are extremely similar for Party ID, News Interest, Ideology, and Education. In contrast,
there is a marked difference for whether individuals were registered to vote and whether they intended to vote in 2012.
This means that the CCES is more heavily weighting individuals with voting patterns that most closely resemble the popu-
lation about which they are making inferences.

Figure 4. Differences in means using the weighted values for CCES with 95% confidence intervals for proportion of respondents
registered to vote, proportion of respondents that intend to vote in 2012, party identification, ideology, level of news interest,
and education level in the CCES and MTurk modules. Positive values indicate that MTurk is greater than CCES. Dashed lines
correspond with the confidence intervals for older respondents and solid lines for younger.
Appendix B: Geographic distribution
Figures 5 and 6 show the proportion of survey respondents by county across the United States.33 Figure 5 presents the
proportions for the MTurk sample that was compared against CCES throughout this paper. Figure 6 shows the proportions
from the large pool of prior MTurk respondents. The proportions were calculated by dividing the number of respondents
in a county by the total number of respondents in the sample. Red points denote the 20 most populous cities within the
United States34 as well as state capitals. These points clearly show the urban clustering we presented in Table 2. For exam-
ple, we can see the high proportion of respondents around large cities such as Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and
Houston. Indeed, the urban clustering and the proportions of respondents in the cities represented in these figures stays
relatively constant across both the CCES and MTurk surveys. Our replication code will enable researchers to map the
geographic distributions of respondents for their own research.
