The Rise of Electronic Health Record
Adoption Among Family Physicians
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Realizing the benefits of adopting electronic health records (EHRs)
in large measure depends heavily on clinicians and providers' uptake and
meaningful use of the technology. This study examines EHR adoption among
family physicians using 2 different data sources, compares family physicians
with other office-based medical specialists, assesses variation in EHR adoption
among family physicians across states, and shows the possibility for data sharing
among various medical boards and federal agencies in monitoring and guiding
EHR adoption.
METHOD We undertook a secondary analysis of American Board of Family Medi-
cine (ABFM) administrative data (2005-2011) and data from the National Ambu-
latory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) (2001-2011).
RESULTS The EHR adoption rate by family physicians reached 68% nationally in
2011. NAMCS family physician adoption rates and ABFM adoption rates (2005-
2011) were similar. Family physicians are adopting EHRs at a higher rate than
other office-based physicians as a group; however, significant state-level variation
exists, indicating geographical gaps in EHR adoption.
CONCLUSION Two independent data sets yielded convergent results, showing
that adoption of EHRs by family physicians has doubled since 2005, exceeds
other office-based physicians as a group, and is likely to surpass 80% by 2013.
Adoption varies at a state level. Further monitoring of trends in EHR adoption
and characterizing their capacities are important to achieve comprehensive data
exchange necessary for better, affordable health care.

INTRODUCTION
Electronic health records (EHRs) are generally expected to improve
the quality of health care, lower health care costs, and provide
patients with more involvement in their own health care.1,2 Federal
efforts to increase adoption of EHRs have accelerated in recent years,
especially with the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic
and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which created the Health Informa-
tion Technology Regional Extension Centers (RECs). Sixty-two RECs
were set up across the nation and awarded $657 million in federal funding
in 2010.3 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also have
set up incentives for adoption and meaningful use of EHRs and penalties
for lack of provider engagement.4
The realization of EHR benefits depends heavily on health providers'
uptake of this technology. The Triple Aim initiative aspires to improve pop-
ulation health and health care delivery in the United States while control-
ling costs.5 The federal e-health directives outlined in the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) support the Triple Aim and complement
health delivery and payment reform initiatives specified in the Affordable

Care Act.6 Realization of the Triple Aim will require
data sharing and exchange that transects all aspects of
health care delivery and depend in part on widespread
adoption of EHRs, particularly by office-based physi-
cians. Family physicians constitute an important case
because they are the largest group of primary care
physicians, and they distribute themselves more pro-
portionately to the population than do other physician
specialists, providing frontline health services at the
community level.7
Considerable variation in EHR adoption has been
documented. Simon et al reported 18% of office
practices having an EHR in Massachusetts in 2005.8
Stream found a 58% adoption rate by family physi-
cians in Washington State in 2007.9 Menachemi et al
studied the increased use of EHRs by physicians in
outpatient practices in Florida10,11 and found the overall
EHR adoption rate in Florida rose from 23.7% in 2005
to 35.1% in 2008. Hsiao et al reported that the EHR
adoption rate for office-based physicians reached 57%
in 2011 nationally.12
In this study we used national data from 2 inde-
pendent sources to estimate EHR uptake by family
physicians and compared trends. We then compared
adoption rates by family physicians with rates by other
outpatient physicians and also investigated geographic
variation in EHR adoption at the state level.
METHODS
For this study, we used data from a census survey
completed by candidates applying for the American
Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) Maintenance of
Certification examination and the National Ambula-
tory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). Eighty-five per-
cent of family physicians are certified by the ABFM.13
Beginning with the December 2005 Maintenance of
Certification examination, the ABFM added a question
regarding EHR adoption to its demographic question-
naire, specifically asking all candidates: "Do you use
an electronic medical record system in your office?"
The 2005 ABFM sample size was smaller than usual
because the EHR question was first added for the
2005 winter examination. The 2010 and 2011 ABFM
sample sizes were also smaller than usual because
76% of family physicians who certified or recertified
in 2003 and 2004 successfully earned a full 10-year
Maintenance of Certification cycle and will not return
for recertification until 2013.14,15 No significant differ-
ence was observed in terms of age and sex, however,
for 2005, 2010, and 2011 candidates in our samples
compared with candidates in 2006 through 2009.
Because candidates cannot proceed to examination
otherwise, response rates are 100%.
The NAMCS, conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS), is an annual nationally
representative survey of visits to office-based physi-
cians and collects information on the adoption and use
of EHRs. NAMCS estimates are weighted to account
for nonresponse. Statistical testing involving NAMCS
data took into account the complex sample design. For
2001 through 2011, we compared NAMCS reports of
any EHR adoption among family physicians with that
of all other office-based physicians.
We tested for differences between EHR adoption
rates among family physicians in the NAMCS survey
(NAMCS-FP) and ABFM rates for family physicians
for 2005 through 2011, as well as for differences
between ABFM and NAMCS adoption rates for family
physicians (NAMCS-FP) and NAMCS adoption rates
for physicians other than family physicians (NAMCS-
NonFP) for 2001 through 2011. We compared these
data using a 2 independent samples t test. Statistically
significant differences were determined at P=.05 level.
We then examined the most recent data available
for variation in family physician EHR adoption rates
across states using 2010-2011 ABFM data and 2010-
2011 NAMCS data for office-based family physicians
and other specialty office-based physicians. We used
a 1-sample t test to compare state adoption rates by
family physicians and physicians from other special-
ties with their respective national averages. State rates
with a sample size of less than 15 or with a relative
standard error of greater than 0.3 were considered
unstable rates and thus omitted in state-specific com-
parisons. We then compared ABFM, NAMCS-FP, and
NAMCS-NonFP rates for each state using the 2 inde-
pendent samples t test.
RESULTS
The EHR adoption rates based on both ABFM and
NAMCS data rose steadily and doubled from 2005 to
2011 (Figure 1), reaching 67.8% for family physicians
in 2011. NAMCS-FP and ABFM adoption rates were
statistically similar between 2005 and 2011 (P >.05).
Adoption rates for family physicians were significantly
higher than for other office-based physicians (ABFM
rate since 2006 and NAMCS-FP since 2008; Table 1).
Significant variations in EHR adoption were observed
across states. Rates reported by the ABFM ranged
from a low of 47.1% in North Dakota to a high of
94.9% in Utah (Figure 2a). Georgia, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Wash-
ington, and Wisconsin had significantly higher EHR
adoption rates than the 2-year, pooled ABFM national
average of 62.6%. On the other hand, Florida, Illi-
nois, Michigan, and Ohio had significantly lower

EHR adoption rates than the ABFM national average.
NAMCS-FP rates (Figure 2b) ranged from a low of
44% in North Carolina to a high of 87.6% in Hawaii.
It also showed a strong regional clustering for adop-
tion. Although most states had rates similar to those
reported by NAMCS-FP and ABFM, significant dif-
ferences were observed for North Carolina and South
Carolina for adoption rates as estimated using ABFM
and NAMCS-FP data (Supplemental Table 1, available
at http://annfammed.org/content/11/1/14/suppl/
DC1). Significant state variations in EHR adop-
tion among other office-based physicians were also
apparent. States with higher EHR adoption among
family physicians generally had higher EHR adoption
for other office-based physicians, consistent with a
state-level effect.

DISCUSSION
EHR adoption by family physicians has steadily risen
reaching approximately 67% in 2011. Both NAMCS
and ABFM data indicated that the EHR adoption rate
by family physicians has more than doubled from
2005 to 2011. We project that it could surpass an 80%
threshold nationally by 2013 based on the current
trend. Adoption by family physicians exceeds that of
other office-based physicians as a group, conform-
ing to what many have reported--that primary care
physician adoption rate is higher than that of other
specialists.8,16,17 The NAMCS EHR adoption rate by
family physicians based on a random sample was not
significantly different from the ABFM adoption rate
based on recertifying family physicians, lending cred-
ibility to these estimates. Significant state variation in
the adoption of EHRs existed for both family physi-
cians and other office-based physicians, inviting fur-
ther research and policy making.
NAMCS has included data on EHR adoption since
2001, modified in 2005 to elicit information on spe-
cific features of computerized systems. Since 2010,
the sample size for the NAMCS supplemental mail
survey increased fivefold to provide overall state-level
estimates, but not by subpopulations, such as single
physician specialty, because of small sample sizes in
the subpopulations. ABFM's EHR survey question has
been consistent, with 100% response rates throughout
our study period, but it lacks a predetermined opera-
tional definition of an EHR and data about specific
features, precluding more granular comparisons. Hsaio
et al reported a 34% national adoption rate for all phy-
sicians having a system that met the criteria for a basic
EHR system in 2011,12 suggesting caution in assump-
tions about the capacities of adopted EHRs.
The multispecialty NAMCS survey allows exami-
nation of differential adoption trends among different
medical specialties, and the large sample sizes within
the ABFM data set allow adoption rate estimation at
smaller geographic units. Our study exemplifies how
a federally funded data set and medical board data
set with different capacities can be used together to
extend analyses relevant to important contemporary
issues.
What explains the significant variation in fam-
ily physician EHR adoption rates among states is

unknown. It is possible that initiatives may not exist
to help physicians adopt EHRs in low-adoption states.
Angst and colleagues identified 4 consistent themes
with regard to embracing health information technol-
ogy (HIT) among states.18 One of these themes was
"innovative HIT funding mechanisms," which offer
financial support for HIT adoption, such as EHR
implementation, prescription drug tracking, and qual-
ity data reporting. They found substantial variation
in states' commitment to these issues. Variation in
the penetration of health maintenance organizations
or other integrated health systems among states may
also explain some of the variation. Large practices and
organizations may be more prevalent in some states
and able to more easily adopt EHRs. Whatever the
explanation, the interstate variability could help iden-
tify areas for targeted interventions, eg, adjustments to
federal funding for various RECs.
Two independent data sets yielded convergent
results, showing that adoption of EHRs by family phy-
sicians has doubled since 2005, exceeds other office-
based physicians as a group, and is likely to surpass
80% by 2013. Adoption varies at a state level. Further
monitoring of trends in EHR adoption and character-
izing their capacities are important to achieve compre-
hensive data exchange necessary for health care. Now
that EHRs are common, important research is both
increasingly plausible and essential to determine how
EHRs can improve health care and population health
and help contain costs.
