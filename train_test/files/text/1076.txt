Background: Data on the prevalence and co-
occurrence of multiple somatic symptoms among US ado-
lescent females as they are influenced by sociodemo-
graphic, behavioral, and environmental factors is limited.
Objectives: To describe the health status of adoles-
cent US females measured by the prevalence, frequency,
and co-occurrence of headache, stomachache, back-
ache, and morning fatigue and to investigate associa-
tions between selected risk and protective factors.
Design, Setting, and Participants: School-based,
cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of ado-
lescents in the 6th through 10th grades in the US. Data
collected between 1997 and 1998.
Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of headache,
stomachache, backache, and morning fatigue.
Results: Among US adolescent girls, 29.1% experience
headaches, 20.7% report stomachaches, 23.6% experi-
ence back pain, and 30.6% report morning fatigue at
the rate of more than once a week. Co-occurrence of
somatic complaints is common. Among girls who expe-
rienced headaches more than once a week, 3.2 million
(53.3%) also reported stomach pain more than once a
week and 4.1 million (74.3%) reported morning fatigue
more than once a week. Heavy alcohol use, high caf-
feine intake, and smoking cigarettes every day were
strongly associated with all symptoms, while parent and
teacher support served as protective factors.
Conclusions: Somatic complaints of headache, stom-
achache, backache, and morning fatigue are common
among US adolescent girls and co-occur often. Effective
clinical treatment of this population requires compre-
hensive assessment of all female adolescents presenting
with seemingly isolated somatic complaints.

HEADACHE, STOMACH-
ache, backache, and
morning fatigue are fre-
quently reported so-
matic complaints among
children and adolescents.1-7 Studies of this
population in the United States, Israel, and
Scandinavia show that, compared with
boys, girls report higher prevalence of these
symptoms.2-9 Furthermore, at least 1 non-
representative US study and 1 Icelandic
survey indicate that girls are at greater risk
for experiencing symptoms concur-
rently.4,6 For all adolescents, the experi-
ence of chronic pain may have long-term
effects and contribute to functional limi-
tations, adversely affecting school atten-
dance, development of healthy social re-
lationships, and participation in a variety
of developmental experiences.10-16
Factors associated with somatic
symptoms include the following: socio-
demographic characteristics, social and in-
stitutional support, and health behav-
iors.2,3,17-21 Social and institutional support
measures may capture the protective role
of peer, teacher, and parental support as
well as risks associated with being bul-
lied.3,19,20,22 Research has also shown po-
tential biological links between some
health behaviors and the 4 symptoms in
question. For example, the relationships
between headache, stomachache, and back
pain and health behaviors such as caf-
feine consumption, heavy alcohol use, and
smoking have been documented, but as-
sociations with other symptoms and be-
haviors need further investigation.3,19,23,24

effects of these symptoms on social devel-

population.Thisinvestigationdescribesthe

prevalence, frequency, and co-occurrence of 4 somatic
symptomsand explores associations with psychosocial and
environmental factors.
METHODS
SAMPLE
Between 1997 and 1998, the National Institutes of Health, Na-
tional Institute of Child Health and Human Development con-
ducted a school-based, cross-sectional, nationally representa-
tive survey of adolescents in grades 6 through 10 as part of the
multicountry Health Behavior of School-aged Children study.
Study design and protocols are discussed elsewhere.26 Schools
were selected to ensure nationally representative estimates for
each grade and classes were selected from the target grade using
simple random sampling. All students in a selected class were
asked to participate with active parental and student consent.
Seventeen thousand students responded, resulting in a partici-
pation rate of 83%. If records were missing for key variables (eg,
age or sex) or had more than 75% missing responses, the re-
cords were dropped according to the study protocol require-
ments (n=835). Records were excluded if the participant's grade
was out of the target range, if the participant's age was outside
of the 99th percentile for the grade (n=440 students), or if either
the participant's grade or age was unknown (n=39). The result-
ing analytic sample was 15686 students in grades 6 through 10,
including 8370 girls. For the 4 dependent variables, headache,
stomachache, backache, and morning fatigue, a range of 13 to
120 records were excluded for each variable owing to missing
data resulting in a final analytic sample of 8250 girls, represent-
ing 10360601 US girls in grades 6 through 10.
VARIABLES
The 4 dependent variables were measured by asking how of-
ten a student experienced any of the symptoms in the last 6
months: rarely or never, about once every month, about once
every week, more than once a week, or about every day. The 5
categories were compressed to 4 levels for this analysis with
the responses for more than once a week and about every day
being combined; the resulting composite category was labeled
"more than once a week." Social and institutional support was
assessed using 3 composite variables: parent support, teacher
support, and student support, and frequency of bullying ex-
perienced during the past school term. Health behavior mea-
sures included the frequency of alcohol use in the past 30 days,
particularly binge drinking defined as 5 drinks or more con-
sumed consecutively on more than 3 days in the past month;
smoking; caffeine intake (including both coffee and soda); and
physical activity as measured by participation in nonorga-
nized sports. Sociodemographic characteristics included grade,
race/ethnicity, and mother's educational attainment.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Statistical analyses were performed using SUDAAN and SPSS
software.27,28 Principal components analysis and correlation ma-
trices (including varimax rotations29 and scree plots30) were used
to determine the selection of variables for inclusion in the com-
posite parent, teacher, and student support variables. SUDAAN
was used in all statistical analyses to obtain standard errors and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) that account for the complex
multistage design. Methods of analysis included univariate de-
scriptive analyses, bivariate comparisons, and multiple logis-
tic regression controlling for all predictors and grade level, race/
ethnicity, and mother's educational attainment. The significance
of the bivariate relationships between the 4 somatic com-
plaints and the predictors were tested using the 2 test. The in-
dependent variables in the logistic regression models were ex-
amined for evidence of multicollinearity and interactions with
grade, race/ethnicity, and mother's educational attainment. All
final analyses were weighted to be nationally representative.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the overall prevalence of headache, stom-
achache, backache, and morning fatigue among US girls
in grades 6 through 10. Within this population, about one
third experienced headaches or morning fatigue more than
once a week, one fifth reported stomachache more than
once a week, and almost one quarter experienced back-
ache more than once a week. Almost 40% of the girls re-
ported stomachache about once a month, while more than
onethirdreportedmorningfatigueaboutonceaweek.Only
one fifth of the respondents reported rarely or never ex-
periencing headaches or stomachaches and only 7% re-
ported rarely or never experiencing morning fatigue.
Race and ethnicity was not significantly associated
with the prevalence of reported symptoms, with one ex-
ception. Non-Hispanic black girls were significantly more
likely than other girls to report stomachaches more than
once a week. Girls whose mothers had not graduated from
high school were also at higher risk for frequent head-
aches (34.5%; 95% CI, 31.5-37.5) and stomachaches
(27.6%; 95% CI, 25.6-29.6) compared with those whose
mothers had at least completed high school (Table 2).
Therewasaconsistentandsignificantrelationshipbe-
tween grade and symptom prevalence. Morning fatigue 4
times or more a week increased from 26.9% among sixth
graders (95% CI, 24.5-28.3) to 36.5% among 10th graders
(95% CI, 34.3-38.6). More girls also reported experienc-
ing backache and stomachache once a month with each in-
creasing grade level, with the exception of the 10th grade.
The prevalence of stomachache reported once a month in-
creased from 30.5% (95% CI, 29.0-32.0) in sixth grade to
40.8% (95% CI, 39.1-42.4) in 10th grade (Table 2).
Co-occurring symptoms were common. About one
thirdofthegirlswhoreportedexperiencingheadachesmore
than once a week also reported experiencing at least 1 of
the other 3 symptoms at least once a week or more. Among
girlsreportingstomachachesmorethanonceaweek,about
40% also reported experiencing backaches or morning fa-
tigue once a week or more while more than 40% of those
withbackachesmorethanonceaweekreportedeitherhead-
aches or morning fatigue once a week or more (Table 3).
Multivariate analyses in Table 4 indicated that very
low levels of support, particularly from parents and teach-
ers, were associated with higher risk for the 4 symptoms
studied. Students who reported very low levels of paren-
tal support were 1.4 times (95% CI, 1.0-2.0) more likely
to experience headaches and 1.5 times (95% CI, 1.1-
2.0) more likely to report stomachaches once a week or
more while students reporting very low teacher support
were 1.9 times (95% CI, 1.3-2.9) and 1.8 times (95% CI,
1.3-2.5) more likely to experience stomach and back pain,
respectively, compared with students with high sup-
port. Prevalence data support these findings, with higher
levels of perceived support from peers, parents, and teach-
ers generally associated with reduced incidence of fre-
quent symptoms, particularly for stomachaches and back-

aches. The proportion of girls reporting a backache once
a week or more decreased from more than 50% with very
low levels of teacher or parent support to fewer than one
third with high levels of perceived support (data avail-
able on request). Girls who drank alcohol were more likely
to experience stomachaches (adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95%
CI, 1.0-1.5) than nondrinkers, while girls who reported
high caffeine consumption were 1.4 times more likely to
report headaches, stomachaches, and backaches com-
pared with those who consumed lower levels. Teens who
smoked were about 1.5 times more likely to report all
symptoms compared with nonsmokers. A dose-
response was also observed between the prevalence of
frequent symptoms and the increasing levels of sub-
stance use and caffeine consumption. For example, the
prevalence of stomachache once a week or more in-
creased from one third among nondrinkers to almost two
thirds among binge drinkers. Caffeine intake demon-
strated a similar pattern with the proportion of frequent
headache sufferers increasing 30 percentage points be-
tween low- and high-caffeine consumers (data available
on request). Bullying experienced at least once a week
increased the risk for all symptoms. Bullied girls were 1.4
times (95% CI, 1.1-1.8) more likely to report headaches
and 1.3 times (95% CI, 1.1-1.6) more likely to experi-
ence backaches once a week or more compared with girls
who were not bullied. Prevalence estimates supported
these findings with three quarters of the girls who expe-
rienced bullying at this rate also reporting morning fa-
tigue (data available on request). No evidence of either
multicollinearity or interactions were found in the mul-
tivariate models.
COMMENT
This first national study to report on multiple somatic com-
plaints indicates that US adolescent females are at particu-
larly high risk for headache, stomachache, backache, and
morning fatigue. While other studies have documented the
high prevalence of these symptoms among adolescents and
girlsinparticular,fewhavepursuedagender-specificanaly-
sis of multiple co-occurring symptoms.1-7,31 Adolescent fe-
males who report experiencing one symptom more than
once a week often experience at least one other symptom
at the same frequency rate. Among girls who experienced
headaches more thanonce a week, 3.2 million(53.3%)also
reportedstomachachesmorethanonceaweekand4.1mil-
lion (74.3%) reported morning fatigue more than once a
week. The high prevalence of these somatic symptoms ex-
periencedaloneandconcurrentlycouldhaveimportantim-
plications for this population's daily functional status and
clinical treatment.
This investigation found a generally positive asso-
ciation between grade level and symptom frequency or
intensity. Age effects reported for the prevalence of so-
matic symptoms vary by complaint and symptom fre-
quency in previous studies. Other studies found a strong
association between increased age and the prevalence of
backache,19,32 while Egger et al4 found no age effects for
headaches, stomachaches, or musculoskeletal pains. In
this study, significant grade-level effects were observed
primarily for symptoms occurring at least weekly and in
some cases monthly, possibly capturing the onset of men-
struation and associated symptoms.33-36 The variance in
age effects observed in previous studies may be attrib-
uted to different sample sizes, age groupings, and study
designs. Further research is needed to determine the ex-
tent to which somatic complaints can be explained by
pubertal developments such as menstruation.
Future research on the relationship between age and
somatic complaints may need to consider the degree to
which observed age effects are potentially a reflection of
girls' increasing participation in risky health behaviors and
reduced involvement in protective activities. A study

reported significant increases in the proportion of girls us-
ing alcohol and tobacco products between the 8th and 10th
grades.37 Increased participation in these risky behaviors
may be occurring in conjunction with decreased involve-
ment in potentially protective behaviors like physical ac-
tivity and activities that foster family connectedness. A re-
cent US study found that levels of physical activity decline
sharply among adolescent girls, with the median activity
score decreasing by 83% between the ages of 9 and 10 years
and18and19years.38 Physicalactivityamongyoungpeople
has been linked to higher-quality relationships with par-
ents, improved academic performance, and a lower preva-
lence of depression.39 This study did not find physical ac-
tivity to be a protective factor for somatic symptoms except
backache. This may be owing to the inability to measure
total physical activity in the survey. In addition to re-
duced physical activity, as adolescents age, less leisure time
may be spent engaged in family-related activities. Several
studies have found parent-child connectedness to be pro-
tective against a range of risk behaviors and conditions as-
sociated with somatic symptoms including emotional dis-
tress,suicidalthoughts,violence,andsubstanceabuse,even
among high-risk groups.22,40-42
Social and institutional support from peers and in-
structors may also have a significant effect on the health
of adolescent girls.19,20,22 In this study, both parent and
teacher support measures had a more notable association
with somatic symptoms than peer support. For both fac-
tors, a protective association was observed for most symp-
toms even at the low and moderate levels of perceived sup-
port (compared with very low). Previous studies have
documented the protective effects of parental support in
particular.22,40-42 Resnick et al22 reported that parent-
family connectedness was protective against several risk
factors for somatic symptoms including substance abuse,
violence, and emotional distress. These findings were ech-
oed in studies of 2 high-risk populations: overweight ado-
lescents and African American girls. Among overweight
adolescents, Mellin et al41 reported that high levels of fam-
ily connectedness were positively associated with better
school performance and lower levels of emotional dis-
tress. Among African American girls, Aronowitz and Mor-
rison-Beedy40 found that connectedness with mothers was
associated with fewer risky health behaviors and more
positive future aspirations. Similar protective effects have
been observed for teacher support.20 These findings sug-
gest that increased parent and teacher support may act
to help reduce risk behaviors shown to be related to health
symptoms among adolescent girls. Additional research
is needed to identify effective methods for fostering par-
ent- and school- connectedness within familial and com-
munity structures that may already be overburdened.
Although peer support appeared to play a less pro-
tective role than parental or teacher support in this study,
the proportion of girls reporting somatic complaints once
a week or more in this study decreased by almost 10% for
all 4 symptoms between those reporting very low levels
and those reporting high levels of peer support. These find-
ings are consistent with those of Natvig et al20 who re-
ported that increasing support from fellow students was
associated with decreased risk for somatic symptoms. In
particular, Natvig et al observed a protective effect be-
tween student support and depression, a symptom com-
monlylinkedtoarangeofsomaticsymptomsinotherstud-
ies.4,7,18 Additionalresearchisneededtodeterminewhether
some risk factors for somatic symptoms can be effectively
addressed through positive peer networks, and if so, what
mechanisms can be used to mitigate the negative effects
of poor peer relations associated with bullying.
In this study, girls who experienced bullying at least
once a week were more likely to experience headaches,
backaches, and morning fatigue compared with girls who
had not been bullied during that term. Previous studies
have documented the association between bullying and
both health behaviors and symptoms.21,43,44 These stud-
ies indicate that while being bullied is associated with
difficulty making friends and lower use of alcohol,21 per-
petration of bullying is associated with more time spent
with friends44 and increased use of alcohol and ciga-
rettes.21 This suggests that although adolescents who are
bullied may be at less risk for adverse health outcomes
associated with substance use, they may be at increased
risk for somatic complaints associated with poor peer re-
lationships.3,18 New initiatives such as the US Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, Health Resources
and Services Administration's Stop Bullying Now cam-
paign45 should be evaluated for their efficacy in raising
public awareness and reducing the prevalence of bul-
lying.
Binge drinking and frequent smoking were signifi-
cantly associated with all symptoms. Of note was the simi-
larity in prevalence of frequent headaches, stomach-
aches, and morning fatigue between girls reporting at least
weekly smoking and those reporting less than weekly
smoking. This suggests that even sporadic smoking may

be associated with somatic symptoms. Smoking among
adolescent girls has been associated with somatic symp-
toms,3 lower parent-family connectedness, and weight
control efforts.46 The reported relationship between weight
control and smoking is particularly salient to the health
status of adolescent girls. As they age, girls report in-
creased dissatisfaction with their bodies,47 participation
in dieting behaviors,48 and cigarette smoking.49 It is pos-
sible that some of the symptoms associated with adoles-
cent female smoking may also reflect negative health ef-
fects associated with the psychological pressure to fit social
body norms and the physical effects of food restriction
and disordered eating.
Alcohol consumption was modestly associated with
increased risk for headaches, stomachaches, and morn-
ing fatigue in this study. The association between alcohol
abuse and lifetime negative health effects has been docu-
mented.50,51 Adolescentalcoholusehasbeenassociatedwith
frequent physical symptoms ranging from headaches to
abdominal pain, risky health habits including poor diet,
smoking, low levels of regular physical activity, and de-
layed puberty.23,52 At least 1 study has suggested that de-
pression and anxiety among this population may be more
significantly associated with reported symptoms than the
physical effects of alcohol.53 Another study has reported
a strong association between somatic symptoms and "re-
lief" substance abuse among adolescent girls, a practice
characterized by substance use during stressful events.54
These findings suggest that the physical symptoms asso-
ciated with substance use may also be reflecting the so-
matization of concurrent emotional distress. Further re-
search is necessary to determine to what extent students
who report risky health behaviors may be otherwise prone
to somatic symptoms and, in particular, how stress and
depression, may impact health behaviors and outcomes.
Several limitations should be noted. The school-
based study population excludes high-risk teens not at-
tending school. Students in special education classes were
also less likely to be interviewed. Students with language
difficulties or learning disabilities may have been less likely
to complete the questionnaires. Students who were ab-
sent on the day of the survey may be more likely to have
chronic illnesses or have higher risks associated with tru-
ancy or other related factors assessed here. Assessment of
effects of absenteeism on adolescent reports of health be-
haviors has shown it may be a problem.55 Students in al-
ternative schools are excluded from the sample and have
been shown to have higher levels of health-related risk be-
haviors than high school students surveyed in the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior
Survey.56 Thus,thelevelsofriskreportedheremaybelower
than those of the adolescent population as a whole.
Assessment of the association between food intake
and restriction practices and somatic symptoms was omit-
ted because of concerns about the reliability of self-
report data for these measures. Self-reported data on risk
behaviors among adolescents have been found to be lower
for dietary behaviors compared with other health behav-
iors,57 while comparisons of self-reported energy intake
and expenditure have shown adolescents to underesti-
mate energy intake.58 Food restriction practices were also
omitted because data were unavailable on the intensity
or frequency of dieting behaviors.
The association between stressful life events, such
as familial illness and violence, on somatic symptoms ex-
perienced by adolescent girls was not addressed in this
study.54 Given the prevalence of sexual assault59 and part-
ner violence60 experienced by adolescent girls, subse-
quent studies of multiple co-occurring symptoms among
this population would benefit from inclusion of these mea-
sures.
Finally, a similar study of somatic symptoms among
adolescent boys would be valuable. Male adolescents do
not report suffering from somatic symptoms as fre-
quently as female adolescents, with the exception of morn-
ing fatigue26; however, further research is needed to de-
termine how social and environmental factors influence
the frequency and prevalence of this condition and oth-
ers among boys.
CONCLUSIONS
Somatic complaints of headache, stomachache, back-
ache, and morning fatigue are common among US ado-
lescent girls. These health conditions are reported fre-
quently and often in tandem with other conditions
affecting daily functional levels. These findings suggest
that effective clinical treatment may require comprehen-
sive assessment of all female adolescents presenting with
seemingly isolated somatic complaints to accurately iden-
tify and treat both the presenting symptom and any re-
lated conditions. While linkages may be drawn between
selected complaints and other biological functions such
as menstruation, most of these complaints seem to be as-
sociated more strongly with social, environmental, and
What This Study Adds
Headache, stomachache, backache, and morning fa-
tigue are frequently reported somatic complaints among
children and adolescents. Studies have shown that girls
report a higher prevalence of these symptoms and are at
greater risk for experiencing these symptoms concur-
rently. The disproportionate rates of symptoms experi-
enced by adolescent girls, in conjunction with the det-
rimental effects of these symptoms on social development,
suggest the need for a better understanding of the na-
ture, extent, and possible causes for frequent somatic
symptoms among adolescent girls in the United States.
This first national study to report on multiple so-
matic complaints among US adolescent females indi-
cates that this population is at particularly high risk for
headaches, stomachaches, backaches, and morning fa-
tigue and frequently experiences symptoms in tandem
with other conditions. Among girls who experienced
headaches more than once a week, 3.2 million (53.3%)
also reported stomachaches more than once a week, and
4.1 million (74.3%) reported morning fatigue more than
once a week. Analysis of selected social, environmental,
and behavioral factors found protective associations for
parent and teacher support, while cigarette smoking and
heavy caffeine and alcohol consumption were strongly
associated with symptom prevalence.
