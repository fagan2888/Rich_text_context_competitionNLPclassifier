Introduction
AT1
receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) have been shown to improve
the survival of patients both in the acute and long-term
phase of myocardial infarction (MI).1 ACEis have shown
to improve hemodynamic parameters and the functional
capacity in patients who have chronic infarct,2,3 but when
the renin angiotensin system (RAS) is active the recom-
mended doses of ACEi do not inhibit the enzyme com-
pletely.4 In case of the antagonist of the AT1
receptors,
although angiotensin II (Ang II) may be formed by differ-
ent routes, the benefits are caused by avoiding the Ang II
effect of interacting with AT1
receptors, a process that
ACEi does not.5 ACE contributes to the formation of Ang
II.6 The effect of Ang II depends on its biosynthesis from
Ang I through the catalysis of circulating and endothelial
ACE.2 Inhibition of ACE also affects the formation of
other components of the RAS.7 It has been reported that
ACEis are directly related to Ang (1­7) because these
drugs prevent the metabolism of Ang (1­7) on the inactive
peptide Ang (1­5)8 and inhibits the metabolism of brady-
kinin, which is a vasodilator potentiated by Ang (1­7).9
Ang (1­7) has central and peripheral actions.10 For exam-
ple, it generates vasodilation of the feline mesenteric
artery, and dog and pig coronary artery. Also, the hepta-
peptide potentiates the vasodilator effect of bradykinin in
the conscious rat.11 Additionally, it has been described that
Ang (1­7) plasma levels are increased in rats, dogs and
Ang (1­7) is a modulator of the
vasoconstrictor actions of
Ang I and Ang II

Abstract
Introduction: The role of angiotensin (Ang) (1­7) on the vasoconstrictor effect induced by angiotensins could be
different in the presence of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB because Ang II is formed through several pathways. Therefore,
the role of Ang (1­7) in Ang I and Ang II contraction was evaluated in aortas from Wistar rats after 48-hour coronary
occlusion treated with captopril or losartan.
Methods: Concentration-response curves to Ang I or Ang II were conducted in the absence or presence of Ang (1­7)
and A779: a) sham group; b) 48-hour coronary occlusion; c) treated with captopril or d) losartan (3.1 mg/kg, i.m.).
Results: Captopril caused a significant increase in the contractile effect of Ang I and Ang II, while losartan reduced it.
The presence of Ang (1­7) in the captopril group showed a reduction of the contraction compared to the sham group,
while the treatment with losartan did not show a significant difference. Ang (1­7) presents effects different from Ang I
or Ang II.
Conclusion: Ang (1­7) showed a modulatory role, suggesting Ang I did as well after treatment with an ACE inhibitor
but not with an AT1
receptor antagonist.

humans treated with captopril or losartan.12 To date it is
unknown whetherAng (1­7) has a role in the vascular con-
tractility of Ang I and Ang II in the aorta of infarcted
Wistar rats previously treated with an ACEi or ARB.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the
role of the Ang (1­7) on the vasoconstrictor effect induced
by Ang I or Ang II in aorta from rats treated with an ACE
inhibitor or an Ang antagonist after 48 hours of coronary
occlusion.
Methods
Animals
Wistar male rats (300­400 g) were used and obtained from
CINVESTAV-IPN (Sede Sur). Rats were placed in indi-
vidual boxes with light-dark cycles of 12 × 12 hours with
free access to food and water. Rats were grouped as fol-
lows: a) sham group with vehicle; b) 48-hour coronary
occlusion with vehicle; c) treated with captopril; d) treated
with losartan. Animals were euthanized 48 hours after cor-
onary occlusion, and aortic rings of all experimental
groups were incubated in the absence or presence of Ang
(1­7) 10-5 M13 and/or A779 10-5 M. Captopril or losartan
were administered at a dose of 3.1 mg/kg intramuscularly
(i.m.) 30 minutes before the occlusion and 24 hours after.
The experimental protocols were designed according to
the Federal Regulation for Animals Experimentation and
Care (SAGARPA NOM-062ZOO-1999, Mexico.).
Reagents
Captopril, losartan, Ang I, Ang II, Ang (1­7), ketamine
and xylaxine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.
Physiological saline solution (0.1 ml) was administered as
vehicle. Ang I, Ang II and Ang (1­7) were dissolved in
Krebs-Heinselet solution.
Induction of MI
To induce MI, the left anterior descending coronary
artery was ligated between the pulmonary outflow tract
and the left atrium using 5-0 silk suture under aseptic
conditions in anesthetized rats (ketamine HCl/xylazine,
80/12 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.); 150 mg/kg of ampi-
cillin subcutaneously (s.c.)). Onset of ventricular arrhyth-
mias and the presence of myocardial blanching distal to
the occlusion confirmed successful ligation of the artery.
Organs were returned to the thorax cavity and sutured
using 2-0 silk suture. Sham-operated animals were inter-
vened in the same manner but suture was not placed
around the coronary artery. The infarcted area was deter-
mined using blue tetrazolium, which stains healthy tissue
blue. The staining made it possible to measure the
infarcted area by planimetry.

at 37°C. The aortas were cleaned of surround-
ing tissue and cut into rings that were 4­5 mm long. The
aortic rings were mounted in 10 ml chamber tissue baths
filled with Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37°C (pH 7.4) and
they were continuously aerated with 95% O2
/5% CO2
. To
record the semi-isometric force development, the rings
were suspended on two wire hooks (NUBRYTE wire) and
fixed to the bottom of the chamber and a force transducer
(BIOPAC TSD105) connected to a BIOPAC MP100WSW
system (from BIOPAC Systems Inc, Santa Barbara, CA,
USA). The ring segments were adjusted to a tension of 3 g.
The integrity of the endothelium was evaluated by the vas-
odilator response after the administration of 10-5 M acetyl-
choline to aortic rings that had been pre-treated with 10-6
M phenylephrine.
The vasoconstrictor effect of Ang I and Ang II.Concentra-
tion-response curves to Ang I (10-12 to 10-6 M) and Ang

hours later.

Ang I (10-12 to 10-6 M) and Ang II (10-12 to 10-6 M) in the
absence or presence of Ang (1­7) 10-5 M and A779 10-6 M
10 minutes before generating the curves10 were obtained
using rat aortic rings with endothelium from the sham
group and the infarcted previously treated with the vehicle,

occlusion was made and 24 hours later.
Calculation of maximal response and ED50. The calculation
of both parameters was made by WinNonlin professional
2.1 software from raw data of each curve (n = 9) for all
experimental groups.
Statistical analysis
The concentration-response graphs were developed with
the GraphPadPrism5 software. To compare the infarcted
area, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was car-
ried out. The data obtained in the concentration-response
curves were analyzed through a two-way ANOVA, estab-
lishing a value less than p < 0.05 to report a significant
difference.

Results
Determination of the percentage of the
infarcted area
Table 1 shows the results of the infarcted area 48 hours
after the coronary occlusion was performed in all experi-
mental groups. The magnitude of the infarcted area was
significantly less in case of that observed with captopril or
losartan groups (p < 0.05).
Effect of Ang (1­7) on the contraction induced by Ang
I and Ang II after captopril or losartan treatments.
Figure 1 shows the effect ofAng (1­7) on the concentra-
tion-response curves of Ang I or Ang II in the aortic rings
from rats treated with captopril or losartan (both at 3.1 mg/
kg i.m.). The figure shows that both angiotensins induced a
concentration-dependent contraction and, compared with
the sham group, the contractile effect in the aortic rings
with 48-hour coronary occlusion shows no significant dif-
ference, while those obtained under captopril treatment
provoked a significant increase in the contractility (p < 0.01
in both angiotensins). Such an increase is related to an aug-
ment in the maximal effect (Emax
) value (Table 2, p < 0.05)
but not in the EC50 values (Table 3). The presence of Ang
(1-7) in the aortic rings from rats treated with captopril sig-
nificantly reduced the Ang II contractile effect to control
values but not in the case of Ang I (Figure 1(a) and (b));
such a reduction is related to an Emax
value reduction
(Table 2). The Ang (1­7) induced an increased PD2 value

(Table 3). On the other hand, the treatment with losartan
provoked a significant reduction of the contraction and Emax
value and an increase in the EC50 generated by Ang I and
Ang II compared with the sham group (p < 0.05 for all
cases). However, the incubation with Ang (1­7) did not
show a significant change (Figure 1(c) and (d)). The pres-
ence of A779 and Ang (1­7) generated an increase in the
vasoconstrictor effect of Ang II with both treatments. In the
case of Ang I, the presence of A779 and Ang (1­7) showed
a vasodilator effect with captopril treatment and no effect
with treatment of an AT1
antagonist.
Discussion
The present work demonstrated that Ang (1­7) showed a
biphasic role in the contractility induced by Ang I and Ang
II in the aortic rings of infarcted rats treated with captopril
or losartan. Although Ang (1­7) showed a modulatory
effect present when the ACE is inhibited, possibly by a
synergistic effect between the ACE inhibitor and Ang
(1­7), in the case of losartan it does not. Also, we found
that Ang I generates contractile effects different from Ang
II with captopril or losartan treatments.
The result of the infarcted area by the treatment with
captopril or losartan agrees with other studies14­16 that
found that ACEis do not reduce the infarcted area; it par-
ticipates in a process that limits the growth of the necrosed
area due to the interaction of bradykinin with B2
recep-
tors. This effect disappears with the administration of the
antagonist of these receptors, HOE140.15 Regarding the
reduction caused by losartan, it was published that ARBs
stop the ischemia process owing to the activation of AT2
receptors, bradykinin and prostaglandins in pigs (like-
wise, the effect is reversed by the administration of
HOE140, indomethacin or PD123319, respectively).15­17
Even when the sham and MI groups showed no statistical
differences to both angiotensins, the MI group generated
bigger maximal effect values. This can be explained by
the fact that the ability of nitric oxide (NO) to relax the
vascular tone is altered during MI. This effect is the result
of the reduction in the vascular response to NO, more
than the reduction of the liberation of NO.18 It is also
known that during MI the levels of Ang II are increased
with a vasoconstrictive effect, and that this is the most
important determinant for the generation of cardiac
remodeling.19 As observed with captopril treatment, the
contractile effect to both angiotensins increased, which
shows that the drug does not inhibit the enzyme com-
pletely.20 It also might exacerbate the activity of other
enzymes present in the system we know of: Chymase,
elastase and cathepsin G hydrolyze Ang I to Ang II5,21
and to act under hypoxic conditions as in MI or even in
Ang (1­12) discovered by Nagata.22 Therefore the grad-
ual increased in the contraction is due to the hydrolysis of
Ang I to become Ang II.
In contrast, the treatment with losartan generates a
reduction in the contractile effects after 48 hours, suggest-
ing it can be due to the blockade of theAT1
receptors. It has
also been reported that AT1
receptor blockade stimulates
the production of Ang (1­7) due to the increase in the con-
centration of Ang II (main precursor).23,24 It is important to
mention that Ang (1­7) generated a reduction in the vaso-
constriction of Ang II with the captopril treatment. Several
researchers have suggested that Ang (1­7) might act as an
endogenous ACEi and obtain a synergic effect with capto-
pril,25,26 preventing bradykinin hydrolysis in addition that
Ang (1­7) increases the vasodilating actions of it.8,9 Other
results obtained from our laboratory support it because,
when the rings were incubated with L-arginine methyl
ester (L-NAME), the vasodilating effect were reversed,
proving that this is due to the liberation of NO (not
reported). None effect between losartan and Ang (1­7)

was found as expected because other authors found that
this interaction is associated with the increase in the brady-
kinin plasma levels.9,27,28 The presence of A779 also dem-
onstrated that Ang (1­7) might be activated by another
modulator that is up Ang II. We propose Ang I to be this
modulator because depending on the presence of an ACE
inhibitor or an ARB, it leads Ang (1­7) to generate vaso-
constriction or vasodilation, possibly by the participation
of unknown peptides or enzymes. Even though it is
reported that Ang I has no effects by itself because it just
provides the substrate for the vasoactive peptides Ang II
and Ang (1­7), we might be mistaken.
