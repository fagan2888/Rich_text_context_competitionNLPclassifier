Introduction. In the United States, dietary supplement (DS) use is common, often takes place outside of the purview of health
care providers, and may involve DS in combination with pharmaceuticals. This situation has led to concerns about interactions
between DS and pharmaceuticals, as well as the risks from polypharmacy and polysupplement use. Methods. We used data from
the Midlife in the US study (MIDUS 2 Survey) to examine DS and prescription pharmaceutical use in 3876 study participants in
order to determine the demographics of high-users (5 or more) of DS and pharmaceuticals and the presence of DS-pharmaceutical
co-use. Results. Over 69% of study participants regularly used DS, 49.6% regularly used both DS and pharmaceuticals, and 6.3%
and 8.7% were high-users of pharmaceuticals and DS, respectively. High-users of DS, pharmaceuticals, and either were more likely
than the whole cohort to be female and of lower income. Conclusions. These findings corroborate those of other national studies
with respect to the demographics of DS users but add new information about people at risk of DS-pharmaceutical interactions, not
an insignificant proportion of the population examined by this dataset.
1. Introduction
In the United States (USA), the use of complementary and
alternative medicine (CAM) is common [1]. One component
of CAM is a category referred to as dietary supplements
(DS), which includes herbal medicines, vitamins, minerals,
and other substances such as amino acids and enzymes
[2].
Nationwide surveys, including Midlife in the United
States (MIDUS), have begun the process of delineating
the demographics of DS users, the prevalence of DS use,
and other related factors such as disclosure to health care
providers (HCP) and sources of DS information (Table 1).
The results of such surveys show that the use of DS is
not insignificant, with estimates of 20% of the US popu-
lation regularly using DS [1, 3]. These rates may be even
higher in some groups such as immigrant populations [4].
In recent years, the medical literature has also begun the
process of assessing DS efficacy and safety, including issues
surrounding the ingestion of numerous DS [5, 6], adverse
dietary supplement-pharmaceutical interactions [3, 7­9], and
specific DS-pharmaceutical combinations that warrant extra
caution on the part of HCP [10].
With respect to the use of multiple DS, there is no
generally accepted threshold at which extra risk is thought
to occur, though there is some guidance about this topic
in the polypharmacy literature. Polypharmacy is a situa-
tion of high risk for adverse interactions or drug effects,
often defined as the simultaneous ingestion of five or more
pharmaceuticals, though the most accurate determination of
risk for a given individual would also take into effect other
factors such as their medical history and the appropriateness
of a pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical dose [11, 12]. The
assessment of DS safety involves a careful examination of
interactions between DS and pharmaceuticals to identify any
adverse health outcomes associated with co-use [13, 14]. All
of these concerns are heightened when health care providers
are unaware of DS use, a common phenomenon in the USA,
with data showing that nondisclosure rates approach 70% in
some populations [7, 15­18].
From its inception, MIDUS, a longitudinal study of health
and aging, has included a wide array of demographic and

psychosocial measures as well as comprehensive assessments
of health (physical and mental) and health behaviors includ-
ing use of prescription pharmaceuticals (Rx) and over-the-
counter medications (OTC) [19, 20]. In the first longitudinal
follow-up (MIDUS 2, 2004­2006), assessments of medication
use were expanded to include DS, thus creating a dataset
containing detailed information about Rx, DS, and OTC
use.
The aim of this analysis was to add to the DS literature
by analyzing data from the MIDUS 2 survey in order to
(1) improve knowledge surrounding the characteristics of
users of DS, comparing these results to other large national
surveys, and (2) explore the presence DS-Rx co-use and the
demographics of people involved.
2. Participants and Methods
At baseline (MIDUS 1, 1995-1996) study participants ( =
7108) were noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults in
the continental USA, aged 25­74 years. As described else-
where [20], the MIDUS 1 sample was comprised of 3 subsam-
ples: the Main sample recruited using random-digit dialing
methods ( = 4244), siblings of Main sample participants
( = 950), and a national sample of twins ( = 1914),
all of whom were invited to complete telephone interviews
and self-administered questionnaires. Nine to ten years after
MIDUS 1 (in 2004-2005), these individuals were invited
to participate in the MIDUS 2 survey, which included a
phone interview and another self-administered questionnaire
[20]. Medication use is assessed in the self-administered
questionnaire, while the demographic data is obtained via
the telephone interview. Only a subset of individuals ( =
4,006) who completed both the telephone survey and the
self-administered questionnaire at MIDUS 2 were included
in the current analysis; this subsample is not significantly
different from the larger sample from which it is drawn [21].
Of the 4,006 study participants, only 3,876 completed study
questions pertaining to DS and Rx use.
The demographic variables of interest are age in years,
gender, educational level (less than high school or high school
graduate (HS) or equivalent (GED), some college, and college
graduate or more), and personal income, reported by the
respondent as wages over the last year, an estimate of a
person's financial resources and status.
The MIDUS 2 self-administered questionnaire included
two sets of items assessing Rx and DS use: (1) "During the
past 30 days have you taken prescription medicine for any
of the following conditions?" Individuals were classified as
pharmaceutical users if they said "yes" to at least one of
these items; (2) "Please check below any of the following
vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplements you take regularly--
that is, at least a couple of times a week." The DS checklist
included common herbal medicines, vitamins, and minerals
and provided study participants the option to add DS not
found on the list. Individuals were classified as DS users if
they checked at least one item on this list. In addition, the
total numbers of DS and Rx being used were tabulated.
Four categories of DS and Rx users were created: (1)
neither DS nor Rx used; (2) Rx only in the past 30 days; (3) DS
only used regularly; and (4) both DS and Rx used. Further-
more, three categories of "high-users" were created: (1) using
five or more Rx in the past 30 days (regardless of DS use); (2)
using five or more DS regularly (regardless of Rx use); and
(3) using five or more of either DS or pharmaceuticals. This
distinction is designed to capture study participants who were
in a polypharmacy and/or polysupplement situation.
3. Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics of individual and paired variables were
examined in tabular and graphic format. A chi-squared
analysis for proportion was utilized to compare variables
as detailed in Tables 2 and 3. Any z-test P value <0.05
was considered statistically significant; values meeting these
criteria were labeled as such in the relevant tables. Logistic
regression analysis was then used to evaluate the group
differences between high- and low-users of DS and Rx. All
analyses used SPSS (IBM SPSS Version 21, 2012). Missing
data was deleted from the cases of interest for the DS and
pharmaceutical variable analyses.

4. Results
Demographic characteristics for the full sample, as well as
categories of DS and pharmaceutical use, are summarized in
Table 2. The sample is predominantly female (55.7%), aged
56.2 years on average, with a mean income of approximately
$28,000 and having a high school education or less. In
addition, among the 3,876 study participants, 2,703 (69.7%)
were taking at least one DS recently, 2,622 (67.6%) were
taking at least one pharmaceutical in the last 30 days, 1,923
(49.6%) were taking both, and 474 (12.2%) were taking neither
(Figure 1).
When compared to the entire cohort ( = 3876), there
were statistically significant differences in the demographics
of study participants using neither, any Rx, any DS, or both
DS and Rx (Table 2, columns 3­6). Notably, when compared
to the whole cohort, people using neither were less likely
to be female (55.7% versus 43.3%, resp.) and were younger
(mean age 56.2 versus 48.7), with a higher income (about
$28,000 annually versus about $38,000). In contrast, users of
both DS and Rx were more likely to be women (62.3%) and
were older (mean age 60.2), with a lower income ($16,000­
$17,999). Those study participants who used any DS (column
5) were slightly older than the whole cohort (mean age 58.0
versus 56.2, resp.), more likely to be female (59.4% versus
55.7%, resp.), and had a slightly higher income ($32,500­
$34,999 versus $27,500­$29,999), though their education was
similar.
When neither category was used as the comparison, both
DS users and Rx users were older (average age 48.7 versus 58.0
and 58.6, resp.), while the Rx users had more people in the
high school or less education category (31.0% versus 36.2%,
resp.).
The number of DS and Rx taken by study participants is
shown in Figure 1. Study participants ingested between 0 and
15 DS and 0 and 12 Rx. As mentioned above, nearly half the
sample (49.6%) were taking both DS and Rx; a cluster exists in
the lower numbers of DS and Rx, though individuals populate
even the higher number combinations (Figure 2). Examples
of these higher number combinations are one person taking

nine Rx and 14 DS, one person taking five Rx and nine DS,
one person taking three Rx and 11 DS, and one person taking
two Rx and 11 DS (Figure 2).
The demographics of high-users (5) of DS ( = 333),
Rx ( = 241), or either DS or Rx ( = 546) are presented in
Table 3. When compared with the total sample ( = 3876),
people in all three categories were more likely to be female,
older (mean age 65 or greater), and with a lower median
income. The low annual income result for the high-user Rx
group was affected by respondents answering "zero" to wages
over the last year. With respect to education, DS users tend
to have more education and Rx users less education. In the
high-user Rx group, more people had high school or less
education, and less people had a bachelor's degree or more
education, when compared to the high-user DS group. Of
note, 28 individuals who were high-users of both DS and
Rx were identified, so 5 DS and 5 Rx (Table 3, column 6).
Exploring the demographics of the high-users of either DS or
Rx (Table 3, column 5), a logistic regression illustrated that
female gender, lower income, and higher age make it more
likely that a study participant is in the "high-use" category,
whereas amount of education was less of a determinant.
5. Discussion
Large national datasets provide information that can answer
questions of importance to health care delivery and decision-
making. This is no exception with MIDUS 2 survey, which
shows that people in this dataset use DS and pharmaceuticals
simultaneously and in multiple quantities. The results pre-
sented here both corroborate past research and provide an
expansion of the topic by exploring details behind DS and
pharmaceutical co-use. For example, this analysis illustrates
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5
that recent DS users (any quantity) are more likely to be
older and women, in line with other prior national surveys
such as the 2007-2008 update to the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) [1, 3, 22, 23]. In contrast, this
analysis showed a similar amount of education between the
DS cohort and the whole cohort; in other trials, DS users are
often more likely to be more highly educated. Of note, the
MIDUS study participants are considered highly educated at
baseline [20, 21], perhaps affecting any additional education
effect that might appear in subanalyses.
As presented in Table 3, the data on users of five or
more DS and/or Rx ("high-users"), considered to be an
important high-risk group, shows that high-users tend to
be older and female. Of the high-user groups, high-users
of DS and both DS and Rx had more education, whereas
high-users of pharmaceuticals had less education overall.
Picking apart the meaning and etiology of these trends, and
finding clinical relevance, is a challenge. Clearly, women,
in particular, women at a higher average age, are at risk
of adverse dietary supplement-pharmaceutical interactions
because they are users of both DS and pharmaceuticals in
high numbers; this is a demographic worthy of a clinician's
attention in this respect.
With respect to the income variable, there are several
reasons why it is more difficult to draw clinically relevant
conclusions. For example, more than for other variables, in
MIDUS 2 there is missing income information, affecting the
statistical significance of the results. Also, with increasing
age, income is replaced by retirement funds, not necessarily
captured by the survey questions which focus on reportable
wages; this would artificially convey that someone has a lower
income when they may, in fact, have significant regular retire-
ment income. Future analyses to examine other variables in
the MIDUS 2 survey dataset relevant to income, such as
retirement income, will help to further examine this variable
and allow a closer comparison to the NHANES results that
showed a higher income in DS users.
There are several additional study limitations that could
have affected the results presented and their generalizability.
For example, the MIDUS 2 survey has a small percentage
of people of nonwhite races and ethnicities, restricting its
generalizability to the US population. Furthermore, our
analysis did not include iron nor calcium supplements, even
those that have been included in some, but not all, other
national surveys. These variables were separate from the DS
data, though still part of the MIDUS 2 dataset, and there
is debate about whether or not such minerals should be
considered DS. If anything, the inclusion of calcium and iron
in our analysis would have further increased the DS use data
for women and older individuals, given that such products
are not uncommonly used in that population. Along the same
lines, the questions in this survey included multivitamins
as part of DS, similar to some, but not all, prior surveys
(Table 1). In MIDUS 2, it is not possible to separate out
multivitamin use from other DS; multivitamin users may in
fact represent a different demographic from other DS users,
though it is not possible to comment on this using these
results.
It was beyond the scope of this analysis to include
the use of over-the-counter medications, nor the specific
pairings of DS with diagnoses and health parameters. Some
of this data is contained in MIDUS 2, but an expansion
of this information exists in MIDUS 2 Biomarker data;
future analyses intend to explore these aspects of the DS-
pharmaceutical overlap. The specific DS being used and over-
laps with pharmaceuticals for individual study participants is
an important next step in focusing efforts in a targeted way on
decreasing the most concerning adverse dietary supplement-
pharmaceutical interactions. In addition, numerous other
variables could be involved with whether people use DS, RX,
or both. One example is insurance coverage; NHIS found
that DS use was higher in people with no insurance. Given
that the analysis presented here found differences between
the cohort as a whole and users ("any" and "high") of both
DS and Rx, future analyses are intended to determine which
other factors, such as insurance, are involved.
In summary, this analysis provides some insight into the
demographics of DS users, pharmaceutical users, high-users
or either, and those at risk of adverse DS-Rx due to co-use for
the MIDUS 2 survey dataset. This large national survey shows
that a not insignificant percentage of people are taking both
DS and Rx and that there are important contributions to this
group from gender status, age, education, and income. Merely
at the beginning of the process of identifying who might
be at risk for adverse dietary supplement-pharmaceutical
interactions, this study illustrates a method that could be
used in other large national surveys and datasets with DS and
pharmaceutical data and serves as a reminder to clinicians
to be aware of such co-use in some patients more than
others, but ideally in all demographics. With that being said,
the ideal way to prevent polypharmacy, polysupplement use,
and adverse dietary supplement-pharmaceutical interactions
would be to query every patient about DS use and have
an informed discussion about risks and benefits in the
context of their health cosmology, past medical history, and
pharmaceutical use. In that way, each of the data points in
Figure 2 would receive attention in the clinical setting.
