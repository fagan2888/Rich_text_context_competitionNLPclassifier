Objectives. This article examines the association between race and the timing of formal long-term care (LTC) service
use, both institutional and community based. It seeks to understand whether early parenthood predicts the timing of LTC
use later in life and whether it in turn mediates the association between race and LTC use. In particular, it explores whether
the lower rate of formal LTC use among African Americans is due in some part to the earlier inception of parenthood.
Methods. Linking measures from the 1989 National Long-Term Care Survey with Medicare claims (1989­1993), we
model age at first use of institutional (skilled nursing facility) care and home health as competing risks using a Cox
proportional hazards model.
Results. Early parenthood accelerates first use of home health for Whites but delays first use for Blacks. The likelihood
of any LTC use by race group converges as timing of parenthood increases.
Discussion. Differential effects of teen childbearing across race groups indicate differential vulnerability to LTC needs
among early parents.
PERSISTENT racial differences in formal long-term care
service utilization have been observed nationally, in area
studies, and across several decades. In general, the literature
indicates that African American older persons, who experience
higher rates of disability at each age, use formal long-term care
at a significantly lower rate than their White counterparts
(Kington & Nickens, 2001; Miller, McFall, & Campbell, 1994).
A number of explanations have been offered, including
differences in economic status and opportunity (Headen,
1992), in area-level segregation and the limited ability to obtain
formal long-term care services (Smith, 1993), and, most
commonly, in caregiving norms and expectations (Chatters,
Taylor, & Jackson, 1986; Miller et al., 1994; Murtaugh,
Kemper, & Spillman, 1990; Taylor, 1988; Wallace, Levy-
Storms, Kington, & Andersen, 1998). Of these, the role of
extended family and fictive kin is considered particularly salient,
that is, the composition of the caregiving network and the
likelihood that older African Americans may draw upon support
beyond the nuclear family as an alternative to the use of formal
services (e.g., Burton et al., 1995; Gibson & Jackson, 1987;
Taylor, Jackson, & Chatters, 1997).
The family is, indeed, key to a long-term care profile. Those
without a spouse or children, for instance, experience a much
higher risk of institutionalization (Morrow-Howell & Proctor,
1994). Research indicates that the availability and character-
istics of family members have important implications not only
for the use of any long-term care over a lifetime (Himes, 1992)
but for the timing and type of care ultimately used (Cagney &
Agree, 1999; Freedman, 1996). For instance, Cagney and Agree
(1999) found that, net of sociodemographic characteristics, both
children and grandchildren play a role in deferring the age at
which older African Americans use formal long-term care
relative to Whites. Apart from consequences for late-life service
use, these family characteristics also reflect distinctive trajecto-
ries of life-course events and opportunities experienced by each
group over their lifetimes. The information contained in these
life biographies typically is not the focus of long-term care
research. Children and grandchildren, for instance, are important
indicators of family resources, but counts of offspring alone
render analyses incomplete. To date, information about the
timing of parenthood--and the family-level implications of the
transition to parenthood--has not been examined.
Parenthood launches women and men into a new and
formative facet of their lives. It is the timing of this transition,
however, in combination with other factors--health, wealth,
social support--that may shape the trajectory these lives take.
The timing of parenthood has been linked to a diverse set of
social phenomena including educational attainment, employ-
ment opportunities, and health (De Wit & Rajulton, 1992;
Hardy, Astone, Brooks-Gunn, Shapiro, & Miller, 1998; Hotz,
Mullin, & Sanders, 1997; Martin, 2000). For the most part,
social science research on the impact of parenthood timing has
focused on the deleterious short-term effects of early parent-
hood, where fewer years of schooling, lower wages, and marital
disruption characterize the life experience of those who bear
children before age 20 (McCauley & Salter, 1995). A small
number of studies have examined later-life outcomes (Heck,
Schoendorf, Ventura, & Kiely, 1997), such as breast cancer
(Kampert, Whittemore, & Paffenbarger, 1988) and women's
labor force participation at older ages (Pienta, 1999). The timing
of long-term care use is yet another distal event that has not been
explored. There are several reasons to expect that the timing of
parenthood and the timing of long-term care use might be
related. First, those who have their first child early in life have
the opportunity to form larger families, which means that more
children may be available to provide informal care. Second, the
timing of parenthood determines the age, and often life stage, of
the child when the parent needs long-term care. Children born

to older mothers may be more likely to be responsible for the
care of their own young children when their parents need
assistance. Demographers have shown that the overall preva-
lence of this ``sandwiched'' generation is low. About three
fourths of the middle-aged population have living parents and
children, but obligations to each of these generations tend not to
coincide: When children are young, grandparents provide child
care and money; when grandparents are in declining health,
children are likely to be out of the home and financially
independent (e.g., Soldo,1996). However, this depends on both
the timing of the onset of disabling conditions among the elderly
and the timing of childbearing (Uhlenberg, 1995). Recent
research in the United Kingdom has shown that highly educated
women who delay childbearing are more likely to have children
at home and care for aged parents than others, implying a
potential increase in this role combination in the future (Agree,
Bissett, & Rendall, 2003). Yet another possibility is that the
timing of parenthood acts as a marker for the nature of
intergenerational relationships within the family (Jackson,
Jayakody, & Antonucci, 1996). Early parenthood, for instance,
may be associated with a constellation of family factors (e.g.,
shared households, proximal grandparents) that consequently
indicate a greater willingness of children to be caregivers.
Transmission of a normative orientation toward familial activi-
ties and obligations may later mean that informal caregiving acts
as a substitute for formal care or that it staves off use of formal
services until later ages.
We sought to understand whether the timing of parenthood
predicts the timing of long-term care use--institutional or
community based--and whether it in turn mediates the
association between race and long-term care. African Ameri-
cans have a lower average age of first parenthood than Whites
and higher levels of teen childbearing (Furstenberg, 1987;
Ruggles, 1994); this earlier timing of parenthood may account
in part for the racial difference observed in formal long-
term care use. We use the National Long-Term Care Survey
(NLTCS) to explore these questions, a nationally representative
survey of disabled people aged 65 years or older, and linked
Medicare claims files. To follow an older cohort with shared
fertility timing prospectively, with access to appropriate claims
data, we found it necessary to use the 1989 wave of the NLTCS
with Medicare claims from 1989 to 1993. Our outcome is the
age at which the respondent first enters a skilled nursing facility
(SNF) or begins to use Medicare home health services (i.e., the
first long-term care episode). First use of SNF care or home
health acts as an indicator--or point of initiation--into long-
term care; we include them under the broad rubric of health,
personal care, and social services that define long-term care
(Kane & Kane, 1987).
Conceptual Model
The life-course perspective provides a framework for
examining the use of long-term care as an age-related transition.
Life-course analysis recognizes that formative events are ex-
perienced over the entire lifespan. Individuals may face the same
decision at the same age, such as a choice among long-term care
options, but they will have arrived there through a unique set of
experiences (Burton & Bengtson, 1985; Dannefer, 2003;
O'Rand, 1996). The timing and sequencing of life experiences
are fundamental to the model; the use of early-life information
such as the timing of parenthood informs later-life outcomes
(Kertzer, 1989; Passuth & Bengtson, 1988; Riley, 1987).
As outlined above, early parenthood may affect family size,
the presence of competing obligations, and the nature of
intergenerational relationships. Thus, early parenthood affects
both the structure and the characteristics of the pool of potential
informal caregivers; these in turn influence the timing and type
of long-term care used. Within this framework (Figure 1), we
test whether the effect of early parenthood matters because it is
indicative of family size or because it determines the age and
life stage of the child. Our model recognizes the quality of
intergenerational relationships as another potential mechanism,
but our data preclude the possibility of investigating this
pathway. Our framework also considers the unique role of
social class, and additional features of family structure, in the
timing of long-term care use.
In this model, we treat SNF care or home health as the
beginning of a trajectory of long-term care service use. Both
programs were initially designed to deliver care post hospitaliza-
tion (Diwan et al., 1997). SNF care is the only type of nursing
home care covered by Medicare, with the stipulation that the care
follows, and is related to, a 3-day hospitalization (Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2002). Alternatively, the
Medicare home health benefit may be utilized if the beneficiary
is homebound, under a physician's care, and in need of skilled
nursing care and/or physical therapy on a part-time or intermittent
basis (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1996). Medicare re-
cipients who use these post­acute care benefits are initiated into
the world of long-term care delivery; this initial interaction may
be of short duration and of a different nature (e.g., rehabilitation),
but it marks the beginning of a relationship with long-term care.
Indeed, SNF or home health use often precipitates permanent
nursing home placement or extended use of long-term care
services within the community. We view this preliminary service
use as an important life event and one that heavily influences the
type of trajectory a long-term care user is likely to take.
METHODS
Data Sources
The 1989 NLTCS, our main data source, is a nationally rep-
resentative longitudinal survey designed to study changes in the
health and functional status of disabled older Americans aged 65
years and older. It also has detailed information on children who
do not live within the household, making it possible to examine
the influence of family structure apart from living arrangements.
The initial sampling frame was the population 65 years of age
and older drawn from Medicare enrollment files in 1982. Further
details on the sampling frame and survey design can be found in
the work by Manton, Corder, and Stallard (1993).
The NLTCS data were linked to Medicare claims information
for each respondent; both SNF and home health data were ab-
stracted. The files were prepared by the Center for Demographic
Studies at Duke University (Durham, NC) with data from the
Health Care Financing Administration. As the NLTCS sample is
drawn from Medicare beneficiary enrollment files, nearly 100%
of NLTCS respondents can be tracked longitudinally with both
Medicare Part A and Part B claims files.

The final analytic sample is restricted to those who identify as
Black or White, those with no use of either SNF or Medicare
home health services prior to interview, and those with children
(N ¼ 2,603 from the initial sample of 4,463 completed
community interviews). Although the proportion of Blacks
and Whites initially excluded for prior use of home health is
nearly equal (26.6% of Black respondents vs 25.2% of Whites),
a greater proportion of Whites than Blacks were excluded owing
to prior SNF use (1.6% of Black respondents vs 4.3% of
Whites). Although these numbers are small, they may indicate
that Whites at greater levels of disability have already left the
community or, if they remain, have already experienced long-
term care use (and thus are ineligible for an examination of first
use). If this is the case, then we are comparing healthier Whites
with Blacks at greater levels of disability. This implies that our
relative hazard estimates are conservative.
Variables
Dependent variable. --Age at first use is consistent with the
analysis of long-term care as a life-course transition. Measured
in days, the variable was created using the respondent's
birthdate and the first date of use from the Medicare billing
record for either home health or SNF care. Age at inception of
the survey ranges from 65 to 103 years (mean age ¼ 78 years).
Explanatory variables. --Race is coded as Black or White
and was determined from the Center for Demographic Studies
Analytic File. Social class is represented by education level and
several variables to assess financial resources. Financial
resources were defined as household income, Medicaid
coverage, and private insurance. The latter two are coded as
dichotomous. Total household income for the previous 12
months is available in 16 ranges from under $3,000 to $50,000
and above. A regression-based imputation for missing income
data used in previous analyses of the 1989 NLTCS (Burton et
al., 1995) was adopted here. Three income levels relative to
poverty were then created (, 100%, 100,200%,  200%), as
suggested by Liberatos, Link, and Kelsey (1988). These were
based on published federal poverty guidelines for 1989 (Social
Security Administration, 1993). Family structure--meaning
those related by blood, marriage, or adoption--consists of
spouses, sons, daughters, and others who are related to the
respondent. Family characteristics include number of living
children, timing of parenthood (, 18 years, 18­19 years, 20­24
years,  25 years), number of daughters, number of sons, and
whether any grandchildren live in the respondent's or the
child's household. Living arrangements also reflect the
structural availability of kin for caregiving; because they are
assessed at baseline, they temporally precede the outcomes of
interest. Living arrangement is coded as living alone, living
with a spouse, or living with others. The categories were chosen
so as not to be redundant with the family structure variables. A
categorical variable indicating the proportion of children
working full-time is also included to address potential
competing obligations among children.
Control variables. --Two dimensions of health--functional
status and cognitive status--are included in these analyses.
Functional status was determined from questions concerning
ability to function independently (without help) in activities of
daily living (bathing, dressing, eating, transferring, toileting,
getting around inside) and instrumental activities of daily living
(heavy and light housework, shopping, meal preparation, tak-
ing medications, managing money, using the telephone). The
assessment of cognitive status in the NLTCS was based upon
the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire score. The
variable used in this analysis is dichotomous, with a score of 
3 errors out of a possible 10 indicating impairment (Pfeiffer,
1975). Gender is also included as a control variable.

RACE AND USE OF FORMAL LONG-TERM CARE S139
Statistical Methods
We use Cox proportional hazards modeling and its extensions
(Cox, 1972) to model SNF care and home health use as
competing risks. This ``time-to-event'' framework allows us to
examine the age and stage of life transitions and to identify the
precise point of long-term care entry. Analyses were conducted
with unweighted data. Robust standard errors were used with the
Cox proportional hazards models to account in part for the
complex sampling design of the NLTCS.
Both the product-limit survival estimator and the Cox
proportional hazards models focus on age at the event. Although
the primary reason for choosing age, rather than time in study, as
the time scale is because age is best suited to test the hypotheses
derived from the theoretical model, there are analytic reasons for
choosing age as the outcome measure. First, if time from
interview date is used rather than chronological age, there is an
implicit assumption that the period of risk begins at the date of the
survey, rather than at some specified age or specific health event
(e.g., stroke, disability). Because the failure to properly identify
the risk period may bias hazard model estimates in an un-
predictable direction (Cnaan & Ryan, 1989), chronological age
may provide a better outcome variable than time from survey
date. Age as a measure offers a discrete, nonrecurring event for
assessing the point of transition (Freedman, 1996). Second, using
age as the outcome variable allows more flexibility in identifying
the age-specific risks of long-term care use because it does not
require age to be entered as either a continuous variable or a series
of dummy variables. Third, age as opposed to time on study is
preferred because it is recommended, for proportional hazards
models, to choose as the outcome the variable that has the largest
effect on the hazard (Korn, Graubard, & Midthune, 1997). It is
expected that the baseline risks for both SNF care and home
health use would change more as a function of age than as
a function of time over the survey interval.
As eligibility for the NLTCS is based on both age and the
presence of disability, persons who were in the community and
age eligible were not included in the survey if they were not
disabled. Thus, respondents who were older than 65 years at the
time of the community interview are left truncated. The
proportional hazards models are modified to account for left-
truncated data (Cox & Oakes, 1984).
The analysis focused on predicting the age at first SNF or
home health use as a function of three vectors of explanatory
variables--race, social class, and family structure--and one
vector of control variables.
The general model can be written in the following form:
log hðt; X; ßÞ ¼ ðtÞ þ ß1
RACE þ ß2
SOCCLASS þ ß3
FAMILY
þ ß4
X4
where (t) is a function of time [(t) ¼ log h0
(t)] and ß is the
coefficient.
The above model can be generalized to the competing risks
case. Usually called an analysis of the type-specific or cause-
specific hazard, a competing risks situation is characterized as
one where the occurrence of one type of event removes the
individual from risk of all other event types (Allison, 1995). For
example, a single model for the event of interest, such as death
from heart disease, can be estimated, treating all other death
types as censoring events. In this case, a single model for
SNF care can be estimated, treating first home health use as
a censoring event. The modeling process is the same as that
discussed above; however, the definition of the censoring event
and the consequent interpretation of the model change.
RESULTS
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics, stratified by race, of
the NLTCS population with no prior long-term care use and at
least one child (N ¼ 2,603). Column percentages and p values
of the chi-square statistic are presented for each variable. No
significant differences exist for age and gender, but functional
status and cognitive status do differ by race. Approximately
48% of the Black respondents show some cognitive impairment
as compared with 23% of Whites. Service use over the entire
interval is higher among Whites, but only marginally significant
for home health. All family structure variables differ signifi-
cantly by race, with the exception of number of sons. Timing of
parenthood indicates a trend toward an earlier inception of
family for the Blacks in this sample. All four measures tapping
education and financial resources differ significantly by race:
Black respondents have fewer years of education, are much
more likely to have incomes below the federal poverty level
(nearly 50% of this sample as compared with just under 19%
for Whites), and disproportionately are Medicaid recipients.
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the probability of first use of either
home health or SNF care by age, race, and whether or not the
respondent is an early parent (defined as younger than 18 years).
For home health, these descriptive results indicate that, with the
exception of some crossover between 70 and 74 years, Whites
regardless of parenthood status are more likely at eachage to avail
themselves of home health services. Interestingly, Blacks who
are early parents are less likely than others to use home health as
they age, whereas the converse is true for their White counter-
parts. For SNF care, it is difficult to distinguish patterns, but, in
general, Whites are more likely to utilize the SNF benefit. At later
ages, Blacks who are early parents may be higher users (but
smaller sample sizes at these ages preclude discerning an effect).
Coefficients from multivariate analyses of SNF and home
health care are shown in Table 2. Because age at first use of
SNF care or home health is the outcome of interest, the risk or
hazard of use is interpreted as a function of age. For example, if
the respondent has a lower risk of SNF use, this indicates that
age at first use will be later in life. Conversely, if the respondent
has a higher risk of SNF use, then the respondent will first use
SNF care at an earlier age. In a general sense, the outcome can
be viewed as the risk of use at each age.
The first set of models shows the risk of first SNF use,
treating use of home health as a censoring event. The second set
shows the risk of first home health use, treating use of SNF care
as a censoring event. This approach enables us to interpret the
covariates as factors that increase or decrease the risk of use, net
of any influence that prior contact with another type of long-
term care delivery system would yield.
Four models are presented for each outcome. The first model
includes the race variable only. The second introduces family
structure, social class, and control variables, apart from the
timing of parenthood variable. The third model then adds the
timing of parenthood variable (collapsed into three categories to
enhance estimate precision and parsimony). The fourth and

final model introduces interaction terms for race and the timing
of parenthood.
For the risk of first SNF use, Blacks are at nearly half the risk
of Whites. This narrows by just over 3% when family structure,
social class, gender, and health variables are entered into the
model. The introduction of the timing of parenthood variable,
found in Model 3, does nothing to close the gap between
Blacks and Whites--neither categorical variable is significant
in this model. The race and timing of parenthood interaction
term, introduced in Model 4, has no explanatory power in this
model. Across models, each additional daughter and, in
particular, each additional son appear to stave off SNF entry
until a later age. Of interest are the results for the presence of
grandchildren and the proportion of children working full-time.
Respondents with grandchildren are at a risk more than one and
one half times greater of entering SNF care than those without
grandchildren. In general, as the proportion of children working
full-time increases, the risk of entering SNF care increases
(with the exception of those who have between 0.76 and 1.0
children working full-time, where the risk decreases slightly).
For home health, Blacks are at a risk 26% lower than Whites
of entering home health care at every age. The gap between
Blacks and Whites narrows slightly (3%) when family structure,
social class, gender, and health variables are entered into the
model. Unlike the SNF analysis, the timing of parenthood
variable is important to the timing of home health use. Although
not markedly changing the race coefficient, those who are early
parents are at a risk of home health use twice as great as those

RACE AND USE OF FORMAL LONG-TERM CARE S141
who first had children at age 25 years or older. Those who
became parents for the first time between ages 18 and 24 are
at a risk nearly 1.3 times greater. The introduction of the
interaction term between race and timing of parenthood reveals
that timing of parenthood operates differently across race
groups. For instance, Whites who are early parents are at a risk
of home health use 2.2 times greater than those who first had
children later in life (25 years or older). For Blacks, however,
early parenthood lessens the risk of home health use; those who
had their first child before age 18 are at a risk 39% lower at each
age. Across models, the presence of grandchildren and the
greater proportion of children working full-time are predictive
of the use of home health at an earlier age, similar to the findings
for the SNF analysis.
Figure 4 offers an alternative perspective on the relationships
among race, the timing of parenthood, and the use of formal
long-term care services. It displays the predicted probabilities
for both home health and SNF care for the four parenthood

groups observed; it does so from a logistic regression model
that predicts any first use of care over the 5-year interval (with
the covariates as described in the model above and with age as
the categories shown in Table 1). These predicted probabilities
illustrate graphically that the pattern for Blacks and Whites
appears to converge as the timing of parenthood is delayed. For
Blacks, the probability of formal service use increases with
each shift to a later age of first parenthood; the probability for
Whites, on the other hand, decreases, although this is more
evident in the case of home health. For those who have a later
timing of parenthood ( 25 years), there is no residual racial
difference in the likelihood of entering home health or SNF
care, net of the demographic, social, and economic factors
included in the model.
DISCUSSION
We use a life-course framework to examine the timing of
parenthood and its influence on the timing of long-term care use.
We then explore whether racial differences in the timing of
parenthood contribute to racial differences in long-term care
utilization. We find that the timing of parenthood is important to
the timing of home health use, but not SNF care. We also find
that the race differential in service use is not fully explained by
the timing of parenthood. Our results suggest that the use of
formal in-home care is subject to the influences of care patterns
within the family, whereas the use of institutional care is driven
primarily by health factors. Although the timing of parenthood
did not fully explain utilization differences between Blacks and
Whites, it did reveal important distinctions. For instance, the
timing of parenthood had opposite effects for Blacks and Whites
in the risk of home health use, and results suggest a similar
pattern in the SNF case. Previous research has shown that family
resources operate differently across race groups in response to
the need for long-term care. For example, Cagney and Agree
(1999) found that each additional daughter increased the risk of
home health use for Whites but decreased the risk for Blacks; the
same was true for the presence of grandchildren. We may be
observing families--and family systems of care--that diverge
in their approach to long-term care assistance. White families
may use home health as a complement, where caregivers solicit
outside aid as an adjunct to their own service. Black families, in
contrast, may provide informal care in order to defer formal
assistance, drawing on a dense and extended family network to
supplement care by adult children.
The life-course framework suggests a number of potential
mechanisms. We do find that family size is significant for SNF
care, but not home health services, and that competing
obligations (grandchildren, proportion of children working
full-time) increase the risk of both types of formal care. Because
the timing of parenthood result is significant for home health,
net of these indicators, our results lend support to the possibility
that differences in the nature of intergenerational relationships
also are reflected in the timing of parenthood.
The convergence of timing effects across race groups (shown
in Figure 4) suggests that the importance of fertility timing is not
incremental. Those who begin childbearing before the age of 18
years, at least in the older cohorts studied here, are a unique
group. The meaning of early teen childbearing was quite
different for Blacks and Whites in this country in the 1930s and
1940s, when these cohorts were having children. Some research
suggests that early parenthood has historically been more
normative among Black families than White (Ruggles, 1994),
and teen birth rates for Blacks have been higher than those for
Whites, at least since 1960 (Heuser, 1976). This may indicate
lower levels of acceptance of early childbearing among White
families and potentially weaker ties across generations for teen
parents. In addition, the higher probabilities of premarital
conceptions and birth among Black women aged 15­29 years
have persisted since 1930 (Bachu, 1999) and imply that more
children born to teen parents may have been raised in extended
families with grandparents around. Documented differences in
the grandparent role across races, in either childcare or custodial
parenting, indicate a supportive extended-family context for
Blacks (and one that likely encourages caregiving behavior
by grandchildren as well; Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1985; Taylor,
Chatters, Tucker, & Lewis, 1990).
Speculating about the impact that parenthood timing has on
the nature of intergenerational relationships and by precept,
family caregiving and later-life long-term care service use helps
us to identify linkages between early- and late-life events. We
do not, however, have the opportunity to examine the nature of
intergenerational relationships directly. Our aim in this work
was to examine structural features of African American and
White families that would potentially explain racial differences
in long-term care use. We found some intriguing effects that
cannot readily be explained, indicating that unmeasured facets
of intergenerational relationships in African American and
White families may be an important mechanism by which
community-based long-term care services are combined with
family caregiving. The rich literature on African American
family life points to a number of potential pathways that might
influence the context of intergenerational relationships (Dil-
worth-Anderson, Williams, & Gibson, 2002; Jackson, Chatters,
& Taylor, 1993; Taylor et al., 1997). The higher rate of
extended-family households (twice as common as compared
with Whites; Farley & Allen, 1987) and the greater likelihood
of social exchange in an extended-family network (Taylor et al.,
1990) suggest linkages that likely contribute to the propensity
to provide care.
Important to our results are several caveats. We were unable
to test all potential interactions or to run separate models by race
owing to the small size of the African American sample. Future
analyses need to clarify the extent to which racial differences in
the effects of each set of factors contribute to racial differences

in service use. Further, we assume that the measures used in
our analyses operate effectively across race groups. Cognitive
performance measures, for instance, may not accurately capture
cognitive status in all groups, as Differential Item Functioning
analysis indicates (Jones, 2003). Alternatively, there may be
important confounders typically not included in social science
analyses (e.g., quality of education) that reduce differences
observed (Manly, Jacobs, Touradji, Small, & Stern, 2002). In
addition, the risks and consequences of early childbearing (e.g.,
lower educational attainment) may be experienced differentially
across race groups; the opportunity to, for instance, complete
high school or receive other training post parenthood may
have been more common for Whites in this sample (and may
indicate more subtle changes within the family than we are able
to identify). Additionally, because of data limitations, we were
unable to explore other characteristics of children (e.g.,
proximity, marital status, spouse's employment) or of other
relatives (e.g., siblings) that likely play a role in understanding
racial differences in the long-term care decision-making
process. Importantly, the inclusion of early life-course indica-
tors, also not possible with these data, could provide additional
information about the meaning of parenthood timing. We know
little about the extent to which early-life conditions, or changes
in life circumstances across the life course, affect health and
well-being in later life (Hayward & Gorman, 2004).
Divergence between these groups also may be due to variation
in access to health services, which is unmeasured here. A history
of reduced access to health and other social services for African
American respondents likely has cumulative effects on later-life
health. This raises the larger issue of social context. We are not
able to assess information about the community in which these
respondents are embedded. Churches, neighborhood social
networks, and other resources within the community can deliver
care directly or may contribute to an environment in which some
forms of care are more available or better integrated than others
(Cagney, Browning, & Wen, 2004; Krause, 1996). Availability
of these resources may be correlated with race in ways that we
cannot readily appreciate. Change in the community is important
to service availability and use as well, even if family members
remain. Gentrification in an urban context and the development
of agricultural lands into housing stock in a rural one mean that
the context of care may change regardless of change within the
family.
Why does the timing of parenthood mark Blacks and Whites
so differently? Is it a product of social circumstances at younger
ages, or is it a factor that determines social mobility over the
lifespan, implying different life-course trajectories? Information
about social mobility--for the parents and for their children--
may provide the linkage necessary to understand how and to
what extent early-life events such as the timing of parenthood
affect later-life changes, opportunities, and, ultimately, health
and later-life service use. Other research investigating the life
course and the evolution of family formation and family norms
suggests that the interplay between family and social opportu-
nity is complex (Taylor et al., 1990, 1997). Accrual of wealth,
for instance, for one generation and education for the next could
introduce important dynamic changes into the role of the family
and its relationship to formal long-term care use.
As future cohorts age, the importance of early parenthood is
likely to persist. Rates of teen childbearing rose over the course
of the twentieth century; although the 1990s have seen
a persistent decline in teenage childbearing, first birth rates to
teen mothers in 1999 are comparable with the levels of 1940
(National Center for Health Statistics, 1999). The aim of our
research was to examine this sentinel event and explore the extent
to which it might influence another important life transition.
Embedding these events in a life-course framework provided
a novel means to examine racial differences in long-term care and
a more general approach to understanding the highly differen-
tiated lives of older adults. The mechanisms by which the timing
of parenthood leads to later-life service use--particularly the
processes by which the family responds to need and the dynamic
nature of the family itself--merit further explication.
