Introduction
Obesity in adolescents and young adults is a major public
health problem with numerous consequences in adolescence
and adulthood. During the past three decades the prevalence
of obesity among adolescents has increased markedly, with
recent estimates as high as 17% for adolescents and 28% for
young adults (1,2). There is evidence that being obese in child-
hood and adolescence at least doubles the risk of obesity in
adulthood (3), and some studies have shown that the most
obese adolescents have a 17-fold greater chance of becoming
obese adults when compared to their nonobese peers (4,5).
Moreover, obese adolescents are 30% more likely to die prema-
turely compared to their normal-weight peers, although this is
largely explained by their increased risk for adult obesity (5).
Theburdenofobesityiscurrentlygreaterwithincertainracial
and ethnic groups in the United States. Among females, this
disparity is most pronounced in African Americans and some
Hispanic subpopulations (2,6­8). In the most recent National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Ogden et al. found
non-Hispanic black girls were twice as likely, and Mexican-
American girls were 1.5 times as likely, as non-Hispanic white
girls to be obese (1). In another National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey study, 50% of black women ages 20­39
were obese, compared to 36% of Mexican-American women,
and 24% of white women (2). There is evidence that this

disparity starts early (9). Kimm et al. found an increase in the
difference in median BMI between white and black girls from
0.4 to 2.3kg/m2 during the ages of 9 and 19 (10). This race dif-
ference is particularly worrisome as black girls who are obese
in childhood and adolescence are more likely than obese white
girls to remain obese as adults (9,11).
Health behaviors, such as dietary intake, physical activity,
and inactivity, have been a major area of focus in trying to
understand the origins of obesity. Television (TV) viewing has
been one of the health behaviors most consistently associated
with obesity (12,13). In their seminal paper linking TV and
obesity in children and adolescents, Dietz and Gortmaker note
that this relationship may be mediated by a direct displacement
of physical activity, as well as an increase in caloric consump-
tion induced by food advertisements and snacking time (14).
Although TV viewing is often associated with lower 
levels of
physical activity among girls (12,13,15,16), it appears to have

Previous studies have observed that television (TV) viewing is predictive of obesity and weight gain. We examined
whether the cross-sectional association between TV viewing and BMI varied by racial/ethnic subgroups among
young women in Wave III (collected in 2001­2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. We used
multivariate linear regression to examine the relationship between TV viewing and BMI among 6,049 females while
controlling for sociodemographic and health attributes. We stratified the sample by race/ethnicity to better understand
the association between TV viewing and BMI across different groups. Black and Hispanic females had higher BMIs
(black: 28.5kg/m2, Hispanic: 27.3kg/m2, white: 26.0kg/m2) than white females, while black females reported higher
numbers of hours spent watching TV (black: 14.7h/week, Hispanic: 10.6h/week, white: 11.2h/week) when compared
to their white and Hispanic peers. TV viewing was positively associated with BMI ( = 0.79, P = 0.003 for 8­14
vs. 7h/
week;  = 1.18, P = 0.01 for >14 vs. 7h/week) independent of race/ethnicity, age, maternal education, history
of pregnancy, parental obesity, and household income. However, in models stratified by race/ethnicity, increased TV
viewing was associated with increased BMI only among white females; TV viewing was not predictive of higher BMI in
black or Hispanic young adult females. Among black and Hispanic females, counseling to decrease TV viewing may
be important but insufficient for promoting weight loss.

an independent relationship with weight status even after

controlling for levels of physical activity (17). Furthermore,
several studies show a stronger correlation between obesity
and inactivity, including TV viewing, than obesity and physi-
cal activity (18­22). Although the association between TV
viewing and weight status has been found in both genders, the
relationship appears stronger and more consistent in females
(17­20,23).
There is evidence that adolescents and young adults
from racial and ethnic minority groups watch more TV
(7,16,18,24­26) and are less physically active (7,25,27,28) than
their white peers. Despite these consistent findings, several
studies of preadolescent to young adult females have found
that TV viewing and weight are not statistically related in black
girls. (16,25,26,28) In fact, the lack of a relationship between
TV viewing and BMI among black girls may be one reason
why some studies of TV and obesity using racially heterogene-
ous populations have had null findings (16). The reasons why
TV and weight are not as consistently related in females from
racial and ethnic minority groups as they are in white females
is not well understood.
Previous studies of how race and ethnicity affect the relation-
ship between TV and obesity have often been small, localized to
a few cities, and/or focused only on adolescents. The National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) offers
a unique opportunity to add to the current literature on eth-
nic and racial differences in TV viewing and obesity because it
contains data from over 7,000 young women from a variety of
race/ethnic groups surveyed both in adolescence and in young
adulthood. The study includes a wealth of information on per-
sonal and socioeconomic backgrounds and health behaviors.
Although Add Health has information about additional forms
of inactivity, such as listening to the radio and/or playing com-
puter games, we opted to focus exclusively on TV because of its
potential to impact weight status through multiple pathways
such as involving the participant in a sedentary behavior or
inducing increased snacking through exposure to advertise-
ments for calorie dense foods. We also felt that TV watching
was less likely than other forms of media to be done concur-
rently with other activities (i.e. running while listening to a
portable music player, playing an active video game such as
Dance Dance Revolution).
We used Add Health to address the following hypotheses:
(i) increased TV viewing is associated with higher average
BMI in young adult women; and (ii) The association between
TV viewing and BMI will be different in white young adult
females when compared to both black and Hispanic young
adult females.
Methods and Procedures
Study population
This research uses data from the third of four Waves of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative
school-based study of adolescents enrolled in grades 7­12 at initial
recruitment. We used two baseline variables from the first Wave
to capture the socioeconomic status of the participants' family of

origin. Wave I data were collected in 1994­1995 and Wave III data in
2001­2002. Because our a priori hypotheses focused on 
differences
between Hispanic, black, and white females, we limited our sample
to females who self-identified as white, non-Hispanic; black, non-
Hispanic; or Hispanic. We excluded those with height <4 feet or 7
feet, as well as those with weight 50 pounds or 500 pounds, due to
concerns about plausibility. The distribution of reported TV viewing
was markedly skewed and thus we excluded those with self-reported
TV viewing above the 99.5th percentile (>80h/week (n = 39). We
also excluded those who were currently pregnant (n = 256) and/
or disabled (n = 298) because we felt that their TV viewing and/or
weight status might be influenced by factors different than those in
the nondisabled, nonpregnant population.
In addition to the above exclusions, we excluded those who had 
missing
data for either the dependent variable or for any of our key independ-
ent variables. However, before this final exclusion, we addressed a high
nonresponse rate (~10%) for the two variables from Wave I measuring
socioeconomic status--parent reported maternal education and house-
hold income. In an effort to avoid selection bias and inaccurate infer-
ences resulting from list-wise deletion, we imputed these variables by
best-subset regression (29,30). After this imputation and all exclusions
(total excluded = 1,053), our final sample contained 6,049 adolescent/
young adult females.
Study variables
Outcome variable. BMI (weight (kg)/height (m2)) was our outcome
variable. BMI was calculated from measured weight and height when
available (95%) and from self-report in the small number of partici-
pants missing measured weight and height (5%).
Primary predictor variable. Our primary predictor variable of inter-
est was self-reported TV viewing. Participants were asked, "On average,
how many hours a week do you spend watching TV?" to which they
responded with a number ranging from 0 to 168h/week. Because of the
skewed distribution of responses we dropped those who were beyond
the 99.5 percentile or 80h/week of reported TV viewing (n = 39). We
then modeled TV as a categorical rather than continuous variable and
grouped respondents into three categories: 0­7h/week; 8­14h/week;
14h/week. We based our categories on an average number of hours
per day extrapolated to total number of hours reported per week. We
chose the highest category based on recommendations from profes-
sional organizations to limit TV viewing to <2h/day. Participants were
also asked, "In the past 7 days, how many times did you watch TV?"
and responses ranged from 1 to 7. We used this variable for sensitivity
analyses and found similar results to those using self-reported h/week
spent watching TV. Therefore, we present only findings using the report
of h/week of TV viewing.
Additional independent variables. Race/ethnicity was constructed
from two questions, one that asked participants to indicate whether
they were of Hispanic/Latino origin and a second that asked them to
choose a category of race that best describes them. We constructed six
categories: Hispanic, black or African American (not Hispanic), Asian/
Pacific Islander, white (not Hispanic), Native American/American
Indian, and Other. As described above, we limited our population to
those who identified as Hispanic, white, or black. We then constructed
subpopulations within the Hispanic population based on responses to
the question, "What is your Hispanic/Latino background?" (Mexican,
Chicano/a, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South American, and Other
Hispanic). We combined Mexican American and Chicano due to the
small number who self-identified as Chicano. Due to additional small
population numbers, we also combined Central/South American with
Other Hispanic and anyone who chose more than one category.
We chose to examine measures of socioeconomic status from Wave I
rather than Wave III. The participants in Wave III ranged in age from
18 to 27. This age range represents a developmental period of incred-
ible flux with regards to socioeconomic status; the income reported
during this time may be misleading because some people are in school

(
undergraduate or graduate), while others are in the workforce. Thus, we
used the Wave I parental report of the highest grade of education achieved
by the participant's mother and the total household income over the last
year. After performing sensitivity analyses, we collapsed the maternal
education variable into a dichotomous variable (less than college degree
vs. college graduate or beyond). We transformed the household income
variable into a continuous measure that was a ratio of household income
relative to the poverty level (taking into consideration the household size
then comparing it to poverty thresholds in 1995, the year the data were
collected). As mentioned above, responses for maternal education and
household income were lower than other response rates because they
relied on the parental responses and thus, we present findings using the
imputed values.
We included additional variables that we theorized may impact weight
status. These included history of pregnancy (yes/no), familial obesity
(defined as having at least one obese parent yes/no), work status (having
a job and/or being a student vs. reporting neither having a job nor being
a student), US native (born in the United States), physical activity (the
number of times in the last 7 days participated in some activity), and
smoking status (current smoker vs. nonsmoker).
Analyses
In all models, we accounted for the complex survey design using svy
commands in STATA and applied weights to account for the unequal
likelihood of being sampled for certain subpopulations. We performed
bivariate analyses of our covariates of interest with our outcome variable
totestforsignificantrelationships.Inourmultivariateregressionmodels,
we initially looked at relationships in our overall sample. Because of our
a priori hypotheses, we then looked at models stratified by race/ethnic-
ity. We performed additional sensitivity analyses within our racial/ethnic
groups stratified by ever having been pregnant as well as by age 22 vs.
age 23. Regression diagnostic procedures showed no evidence of multi-
collinearity, heteroscedasticity, or substantial influence from outliers.
Results
Black and Hispanic females had significantly higher BMIs com-
pared to whites (black: 28.5kg/m2; Hispanic: 27.3kg/m2; white:
26.0kg/m2) (Figure 1) and were more likely to be overweight
or obese (57.2% of blacks, 53.4% of Hispanics were overweight
or obese compared to 42.7% of whites). Black females reported
watching TV more h/week than either Hispanics or whites
(15h/week for black females vs. 11 for both Hispanic and
white females) (Figure 2). There were also significant differ-
ences between the socioeconomic status of the different races/
ethnicities with whites having higher parent-reported house-
hold income than either blacks or Hispanics and being more
likely to have a mother who completed college (Table 1). Black
females were nearly twice as likely as white females to report
ever having been pregnant. All three groups had high levels of
participation in either work or school.
The results for our multivariate models with the three racial/
ethnic groups (blacks, Hispanics, and whites) combined and
with the subpopulations of Hispanics separated are shown in
Table 2. In this model, BMI increased with greater time spent
watching TV. Those who watch 8­14h/week had BMIs that
were on average 0.8kg/m2 higher and those who watch >14h/
week had BMIs that were on average 1.2kg/m2 higher than
those who watched 7h/week. In this overall model, black,
Mexican-American, and Puerto Rican females were all signifi-
cantly heavier than their white peers. Having at least one obese
parent was associated with a 3.7kg/m2 increase in BMI relative
to those without an obese parent.
We next stratified our results by race/ethnicity (Table 3).
Among white females we observed a similar relationship
between TV viewing and BMI as in the overall population.
However, among both black and Hispanic subpopulations,
we found no association between TV viewing and BMI. In an
additional model, we examined the effect of TV viewing across
subpopulations of Hispanics and found no difference in the
magnitude of the association (P > 0.05 for all interaction terms
of Hispanic subpopulations × TV viewing; data not shown).
Because pregnancy rates varied by race/ethnicity, in a sec-
ondary analyses, we assessed the impact of pregnancy on the

relationship between TV viewing and BMI across racial/ethnic
groups. We did not observe a significant interaction between
history of pregnancy and TV viewing in any of the racial/
ethnic groups. Moreover, models stratified on history of preg-
nancy did not yield materially different results. We also exam-
ined the effect of US nativity, smoking, and physical activity in
our models and found no association (data not shown).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that increased TV viewing is associated
withincreasedBMIinanationallyrepresentativesampleofyoung
women,butthattheassociationdiffersbyracialandethnicgroup.
Among non-Hispanic whites, after controlling for age, parental
BMI, maternal education, income, pregnancy history, and educa-
tion or job status, there was a significant association between TV
viewing and BMI. However, this study did not find an association
between TV viewing and BMI in black or Hispanic women either
before or after controlling for known and suspected confound-
ers. This lack of an association is consistent with findings from
earlier studies of younger participants (16,25,26,28). Given that
blacks watched more hours of TV than the whites and Hispanics
in the study, one possible explanation would be that the major-
ity of blacks are beyond some threshold effect for TV exposure.
Although mean hours of TV viewing were higher in blacks than
in other racial/ethnic groups in this study, there was still consid-
erable variation in viewing hours among blacks and the distribu-
tion of their viewing hours overlapped considerably with those of
whites and Hispanics. Therefore, a threshold effect is unlikely to
be the reason that an association was not identified.
Another possibility is that blacks interact with TV media
differently than whites. Although shows popular with blacks
have been documented as having more overweight characters
and more food commercials (31), it is possible that blacks are
less susceptible to the effects of TV advertising than whites.
Although there is some self-reported data suggesting that
blacks are more likely than whites to eat while watching TV
(32), little is known about what individuals are actually doing
while the TV is on. Some have hypothesized that because the
TV is more likely to be on throughout the day in black homes,
reported TV viewing hours may not actually be watched with
full attention and therefore may have less of an impact (26).
A third possibility is that TV is too minor a factor in the lives
of black Americans relative to other "obesogenic" aspects of
their environment. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely than
whites to live in neighborhoods with fewer supermarkets, fewer
parks, more fast food establishments, higher crime, inadequate
recreational areas, to be from single-parented, lower income
households, and to skip breakfast (33). Lower socioeconomic
status is consistently associated with higher rates of obesity
and this relationship is likely mediated by many of the factors
noted above. A study by Singh et al., which did find an associa-
tion between TV viewing and BMI in blacks, noted that this
association was stronger in those from higher socioeconomic
groups (23), perhaps because fewer other negative factors were
present. Maternal education, a marker for socioeconomic sta-
tus, was indeed significantly associated with BMI in the model
for blacks in our study, although TV viewing was not.
This study also did not find an association between TV
viewing and BMI among Hispanic females. Hispanic par-
ticipants have not been included in studies as often as non-
Hispanic blacks and whites and thus the relationship between
TV viewing and BMI in Hispanic females is less clear. Results
from previous studies of TV viewing and BMI among nation-
ally representative and ethnically diverse samples have been
inconsistent. One reason for the inconsistent findings among
Hispanics may be their ethnic diversity and levels of accultura-
tion, which lead to different health beliefs, behaviors, and out-
comes (34). However, when we subdivided the Hispanics in
this study by country of origin, we still found no relationship

between TV viewing and obesity. This is surprising given the
heterogeneity of the Hispanic population, but may be related
to the small numbers of individuals in each subgroup and the
lack of adequate power to find differences among them.
There are several important limitations to this study. First,
this is a cross-sectional study and therefore a causal relation-
ship between TV viewing and obesity in young women can-
not be demonstrated by this analysis. It is possible that those
young women who were already overweight or obese preferred
to watch TV because they were physically less able to be active.
It is also possible that increased TV viewing is a marker of
another factor associated with obesity that we did not meas-
ure, such as depression. However, while the majority of studies
examining the relationship between TV viewing and obes-
ity have been cross-sectional, a few longitudinal studies have
demonstrated a link between early TV use and obesity later in
adolescence and young adulthood (19,20,35), suggesting that
there is indeed a causal relationship.
Second, this study used self-reported measures of TV view-
ing. Results are therefore subject to social desirability and
social approval bias given that some individuals may have
chosen to under-report their sedentary behaviors. Indeed,
individuals with high scores on instruments measuring social
desirability have been shown to over-report physical activity
(36) and under-report calorie intake (37) when compared to
objective measures of these behaviors. Furthermore, there is
evidence that blacks and Mexican Americans score higher on
social desirability scales and use more extreme categories on
Likert scales as compared to whites (38). Under-reporting TV
viewing would be expected to bias results toward the null, so it
is possible that under-reporting of viewing time by blacks and
Hispanics contributed to our inability to find an association in
these groups.
In conclusion, TV viewing is related to BMI in a diverse
sample of young adult women, but the relationship is complex
and inconsistent across racial/ethnic subgroups. We believe
providers should continue to recommend limiting TV view-
ing when counseling young women on healthy habits, given
that TV viewing is a modifiable behavior, whereas other fac-
tors associated with BMI such as socioeconomic status are less
quickly and easily changed. But they should understand that
women from certain racial and ethnic minority groups may
derive less of a benefit on weight status from reductions in
TV viewing time. Policy initiatives and public education cam-
paigns aimed at changing the content of food advertising on
TV may also be expected to yield mixed results. More work is
needed to identify the factors driving the obesity epidemic in
young black and Hispanic women, as these groups are particu-
larly impacted by obesity.
