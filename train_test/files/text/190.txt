Reliability of Reported Age at Menopause
Robert A. Hahn,1 Elaine Eaker,2 and Henry Rolka1
Age at menopause is an important epidemiologic characteristic whose reliability of reporting in the US
population is not known. The authors examined four hypotheses about the reliability of reported age at
menopause in the United States: 1) women with hysterectomy-induced menopause more reliably report their
age at menopause than women who have undergone natural menopause; 2) reliability declines with time since
menopause; 3) reliability declines with age; and 4) women with higher educational levels report their age at
menopause more reliably than women with less education. The authors used linear regression models among
2,545 women in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Followup Study (1971-1984)
and compared responses at first and follow-up interviews. Among women who had undergone a natural
menopause, 44% reported their age at menopause within one year from the first to second interviews; among
women who had undergone a hysterectomy-induced menopause, 59% reported their age at menopause
within one year from first to follow-up interviews. Only hysterectomy status and years from menopause to
follow-up interview were significantly associated with the absolute difference between age at menopause
reported at first and follow-up interviews. The authors conclude that caution in studies involving age at
menopause may enhance our understanding of this critical event in the lives of women. Am J Epidemiol

age of onset; data collection; hysterectomy; menopause; reliability and validity
Menopause is an event that directly affects the re-
productive capacities and personal lives of women. In
addition, the hormonal changes associated with meno-
pause may be related to various chronic conditions,
e.g., osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases (1).
Menopause is also the outcome of hysterectomy--the
most common nonobstetric surgery in the United
States. In recent years, 580,000 women have under-
gone this operation annually (2). Because of the large
number of women who have had hysterectomies and
because women who have undergone this operation
are not at risk for certain other conditions or proce-
dures, e.g., endometrial cancer or surgical sterilization,
information on hysterectomy is basic in estimating
populations at risk for such conditions (3, 4).
Because age at menopause is an important demo-
graphic and epidemiologic determinant, we examined
the reliability of age at menopause reported at two

different times using a sample from the United States
noninstutionalized population of women aged between
25 and 74 years. We examined four hypotheses:
1. Women with hysterectomy-induced menopause
will more reliably report their age at menopause
than women who have undergone natural meno-
pause.
2. Reliability of recall declines with time elapsed
since menopause.
3. Reliability declines with age, independent of
time since menopausal event.
4. Women with higher educational levels report
their age at menopause more reliably than
women with lower levels of education.
We also examined digit preference in reported age
at menopause, i.e., a preference for reporting ages
with years ending with "0," "5," or "2."
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From 1971 through 1975, as a part of the First
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES I), a probability sample of 14,407 adults
aged 25-74 years from the noninstitutionalized civil-
ian population of the United States was interviewed
and examined; the sample included 8,597 women (5,
6). During the initial survey period (1971-1974), per-
771
772 Hahn et al.
sons from regions affected by poverty, older persons,
and women of childbearing ages were oversampled.
During 1974-1975, an additional sample was drawn,
without oversampling, to increase the total sample
size.
From 1981 through 1984, extensive efforts were
made in the National Health Examination Follow-up
Study (NHEFS) to recontact, reinterview, and briefly
reexamine the NHANES I population (6). Follow-up
information was available for 13,318 (92.4 percent) of
persons in the original sample; of these initial respon-
dents, 2,022 (15.2 percent) had died. Information on
subjects who had died or were disabled was provided
by proxies.
At initial interview, women were asked, "How old
were you when your periods or menstrual cycle start-
ed?" They were then asked, "Have they stopped en-
tirely?" and "At what age?" At follow-up, women
were asked, "At what age did you have your last
period?" and "Did your periods stop naturally, because
you had surgery or for some other reason?" In this
study, we refer to women who reported that their
menstrual cycles had stopped naturally as menopausal
and to women who reported that their menopause
resulted from surgery as having undergone a hyster-
ectomy.
The study sample included women who reported at
both intake and follow-up interviews that their menses
had stopped. We excluded subjects whose menopausal
history was reported by proxies as well as women who
were pregnant at initial interview. We also excluded
two women in the sample whose reported chronolog-
ical age at first interview was less than their age at
menopause reported at the same interview.
We measured the reliability of reported age at
menopause by the difference between the age reported
by menopausal women during their follow-up inter-
view and the age reported in the NHANES I interview
(i.e., age reported at follow-up -- age reported at first
interview). We focused on the absolute difference as a
specific outcome measure.
To test the four study hypotheses, we used multiple
linear regression models (7) in which the absolute
difference between age at menopause reported at first
and follow-up interviews was the dependent variable;
age, hysterectomy status, years from menopause
to final interview, and education were independent
variables. Because the hypothesized decline in reli-
ability over time might be different for women with
and without hysterectomies, we included an interac-
tion term for hysterectomy and time-since-menopause.
Nonsignificant terms (p > 0.05) were removed from
the model one at a time, and the model was retested.
We also used the Pearson product moment correlation
(8) to compare age at menopause reported at first and
follow-up interviews; we compared correlations be-
tween women with natural menopause and those with
hysterectomy-induced menopause. Because data were
collected by using a complex sample survey method-
ology, sampling weights were taken into account in
the analysis by using SUDAAN software (9). The
design effect observed in this analysis ranged from
1.92 to 2.29. Thus, had the complex survey design not
been taken into account, variances would have been
underestimated by approximately one half.
Finally, we examined digit preference in reported
ages, e.g., a preference for ages ending in "0," "5," or
"2." Under the assumption of unbiased reporting, it is
reasonable to expect close to 10 percent of the age
reports to end in each of the digits "0" through "9." To
test this assumption, we used a chi-square goodness of
fitness test (10).
RESULTS
In the NHANES I cohort of 7,011 nonpregnant
women aged 25-74 years who responded for them-
selves in first and follow-up interviews, 2,545 (36.3
percent) reported being menopausal at both inter-
views. Among menopausal women, 1,473 (57.9 per-
cent) had undergone natural menopause and 1,072
(42.1 percent) had experienced hysterectomies (table
1). Among women who reported a natural menopause,
the median age at menopause was reported at first (and
follow-up) interviews to be 50 years. Among women
who reported menopause by hysterectomy, the median
age at menopause was reported at first interview to be
40 years. Women who had undergone a hysterectomy-
induced menopause were younger and had less time

from reported age at menopause to follow-up inter-
view than women who had undergone natural meno-
pause; comparison groups did not differ substantially
in educational level (table 1).
Median follow-up time both for women with natural
and with hysterectomy-induced menopause was be-
tween 9 and 10 years. Among women who had under-
gone a natural menopause, median time from meno-
pause to follow-up was 24 years. Among women who
had undergone a hysterectomy, median time from
menopause to follow-up was 21 years. Among women
who had undergone natural menopause, 26.5 percent
reported the same age at first and follow-up inter-
views, and 8.8 percent reported ages that differed by
>10 years (table 2, figure 1). Among women who had
experienced hysterectomy-induced menopause, 32.6
percent reported the same age at first and follow-up
interviews, and 5.6 percent reported ages that differed
by >10 years (table 2, figure 1). The median differ-
ence in reported age was approximately zero both for
women with natural and hysterectomy-induced meno-
pause. Both for women with natural and hysterectomy-
induced menopause, there was no systematic tendency
for reported ages at menopause to increase or decrease
from first to follow-up interviews.
In a regression model including terms for age, hys-
terectomy status, years from menopause to follow-up
interview, the interaction of hysterectomy and years
since menopause, and education, only hysterectomy
status (/3 = 2.29, p < 0.01) and years from menopause
to follow-up interview (0 = 1.92, p = 0.02) were
significantly associated with the absolute difference
between first and follow-up reported ages at meno-
pause (figure 1). There was no association between
either a woman's age or her education and the absolute
difference in reported age at menopause.

On average, women with hysterectomy had a 10-
month smaller absolute difference between ages re-
ported at first and follow-up interviews than women
with natural menopause. The correlation of ages given
at first and follow-up interviews was 0.57 {p <
0.0001) among women with natural menopause and
0.82 {p < 0.0001) among women with hysterectomy-
induced menopause (figure 1).
Chi-square goodness of fit test indicated digit pref-
erence for reported age at menopause for both the
initial survey and for the follow-up {p < 0.0001). The
pattern of overall preference was greatest for those
numerals ending in "0," followed by "5," "2," and "8."
At first interview, women with hysterectomy-induced
menopause were 1.2-1.3 times more likely than
chance to report an age ending in "0," "5," or "8";
women with natural menopause were 2.1 times more
likely than chance to report an age ending in "0," and
1.4-1.5 times more likely to report an age ending in
"5" or "2." Only among women with hysterectomy-
induced menopause, digit preference increased
slightly from initial to follow-up interviews.
Comparison of responses to questions regarding re-
productive characteristics in the follow-up cohort in-
dicates that the questions asked may have been con-
fusing to respondents. Among 1,749 women who
reported at follow-up having had a hysterectomy (and
who also answered questions about their womb and
ovaries), 221 (12.6 percent) reported that they still had
their wombs; of these women, 126 also reported that
they still had both ovaries. In addition, of 2,425
women who reported not having had a hysterectomy,
206 (8.5 percent) reported not having their womb.
DISCUSSION
Among women who had experienced natural meno-
pause and who were interviewed on two occasions, 44
percent reported their age at menopause within one
year from the first to second interviews, while among
women who had undergone hysterectomy-induced
menopause, 59 percent reported their age at meno-
pause within one year from first to follow-up inter-
views. Among women who had undergone a natural
menopause, 9 percent differed in age at menopause
reported in two interviews by ^10 years, and among
women who had undergone a hysterectomy-induced
menopause, 6 percent differed in age at menopause
reported in two interviews by ^10 years. The finding
that the median difference in reported age was approx-
imately zero suggests that there is no systematic age
misclassification, i.e., women do not tend to recall
their menopause either earlier or later from first to
follow-up interviews. Difference in reported age is not
significantly affected by chronological age or level of

education, but increases with time since menopause
and is greater among women who had undergone
natural menopause than among those who had expe-
rienced hysterectomy-induced menopause. There was
a marked preference in recalled ages ending with
digits "0," "5," and, to a lesser extent, "2."
In the absence of medical or physiologic documen-
tation, this study could not address validity--that is,
reported versus true age at menopause. With discrep-
ant reported ages, although both may be erroneous,
both cannot be true. Because reporting may be more
accurate when it occurs soon after an event (rather
than later) and because recall generally declines with
increasing age, ages reported more proximal to meno-
pausal events may be more valid than ages reported
later.
The questions asked about menopausal status in first
and follow-up interviews were not identical and might
have been interpreted differently. The question at ini-
tial interview, "Have they [i.e., your periods or men-
strual cycle] stopped entirely?" (followed by a ques-
tion of the age at this event) more clearly indicates
menopause than does the question asked at follow-up,
"At what age did you have your last period?" How-
ever, the next question in the follow-up interview, i.e.,
"Did your periods stop naturally, because you had
surgery, or for some other reason?", clarifies the ref-
erence of the preceding question to menopause. Nev-
ertheless, there is evidence of misunderstanding in
responses to some of the questions asked. At follow-
up, 12.6 percent of women who claimed to have had a
hysterectomy also reported still having their "womb or
uterus," and 8.5 percent of women who claimed not to
have had a hysterectomy also reported not having their
"womb or uterus." The likelihood that a woman re-
ported having had a hysterectomy and still having a
womb did not differ substantially among those with
and without a high school education.
Based on small, regional samples, two previous
studies have assessed the reliability of reported age at
menopause. Bean et al. (11) recorded menstrual his-
tory events reported near the time of their occurrence
and found that 83.4 percent of college-educated
women who had undergone a hysterectomy reported
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 146, No. 9, 1997
Reliability of Reported Age at Menopause 775
their age at hysterectomy within one year from first to
follow-up interviews a mean of 10.6 years later; 75.5
percent of women with a natural menopause report-
ed their age at menopause within one year from first
to follow-up interviews a mean of 7.6 years later.
Paganini-Hill and Ross (12) compared the age at last
menstrual period reported by older, affluent women
with the medical records of the same women. These
authors found that 48.4 percent of women who had
undergone a natural menopause agreed on their age at
menopause within one year, and 67.7 percent agreed
within 3 years. Among women with a hysterectomy,
67.8 percent were within one year of reported age at
hysterectomy, and 81.4 percent were within 3 years.
The reliability reported here is substantially less
than that reported by Bean et al. (11) and slightly less
than that reported by Paganini-Hill and Ross (12). The
greater reliability reported by Bean et al. may be a
result of the college education and/or the frequent
interviewing of the cohort whose menstrual histories
were updated in ongoing surveys, resulting in repeated
prompting to recall menstrual events. The lower reli-
ability may also result from different wordings and
different understandings (or misunderstandings) by
NHANES and NHEFS subjects.
Our results suggest the need for caution in research
involving reported age at menopause, and particularly
greater caution for reported age among women who
have undergone a natural menopause and among
women who report their menopause many years since
the event. Our results also provide a means for con-
ducting sensitivity analyses in studies using reported
age at menopause (11); they indicate the range of
variability in reporting that may be expected. Such
caution may enhance our understanding of this critical
event in the lives of women.
