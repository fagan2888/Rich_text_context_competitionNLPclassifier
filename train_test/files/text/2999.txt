MORTALITY FROM HEART
disease has declined sub-
stantially in the United
States during the past 30
years.1-4 Because heart disease is the ma-
jor cause of death associated with dia-
betes,5,6 it would be expected that the
mortality decline in the United States
as a whole also would have been expe-
rienced by those with diabetes. How-
ever, no study has examined whether
people with diabetes in the United
States have benefited from this gen-
eral phenomenon and, if so, whether
the extent of their mortality rate de-
cline is similar to that of people with-
out diabetes.
To examine these issues, we ana-
lyzed mortality in 2 representative na-
tional cohorts derived from subjects in
the First National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES I)
of 1971 through 1975 and the NHANES
I Epidemiologic Follow-up Survey
(NHEFS) of 1982 through 1984. Both
cohorts were followed up prospec-
tively for mortality for an average of 8
to 9 years.
METHODS
NHANES I included a national prob-
ability sample of 14 376 persons aged
25 to 74 years who were interviewed
for sociodemographic information and
history of diabetes. The NHANES I sub-
jects were followed up in 1982-1984,
1986, 1987, and 1992-1993 in the
NHEFS. In each follow-up, the sub-
jects (or their proxies) were inter-
viewed again to determine vital status
(alive or dead), whether diabetes had
been diagnosed, and other informa-
tion. Follow-up was completed for 96%
of subjects.5 Two nationally represen-
tative cross-sectional samples of adults
aged 35 to 74 years were created from
these data. Cohort 1 was derived from
10 649 people in NHANES I who were
aged 35 to 74 years at the time of their
1971-1975 interview. Cohort 2 was de-
rived from 9233 subjects in NHEFS
who were aged 35 to 74 years on the
date of the self or proxy interview in
1982-1984.
Cohort 1
Of the 10 649 subjects aged 35 to 74
years in NHANES I, 670 subjects (285
men and 385 women) reported a phy-
sician diagnosis of diabetes and were de-
fined as having diabetes. It has previ-
ously been demonstrated that a self-
report of physician-diagnosed diabetes
is accurate and valid.7-9 Of the 9979 sub-
jects without a history of diabetes, 1110
individuals were excluded from analy-
sis, including 1070 subjects for whom
any follow-up interview data indi-
cated that they had been diagnosed as
having diabetes and 40 subjects who
had diabetes listed on their death cer-

Context Mortality from coronary heart disease has declined substantially in the United
States during the past 30 years. However, it is unknown whether patients with dia-
betes have also experienced a decline in heart disease mortality.
Objective To compare adults with diabetes with those without diabetes for time trends
in mortality from all causes, heart disease, and ischemic heart disease.
Design, Setting, and Participants Representative cohorts of subjects with and
without diabetes were derived from the First National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES I) conducted between 1971 and 1975 (n = 9639) and the NHANES
I Epidemiologic Follow-up Survey conducted between 1982 and 1984 (n = 8463). The
cohorts were followed up prospectively for mortality for an average of 8 to 9 years.
Main Outcome Measure Changes in mortality rates per 1000 person-years for all
causes, heart disease, and ischemic heart disease for the 1982-1984 cohort compared
with the 1971-1975 cohort.
Results For the 2 periods, nondiabetic men experienced a 36.4% decline in age-
adjusted heart disease mortality compared with a 13.1% decline for diabetic men. Age-
adjusted heart disease mortality declined 27% in nondiabetic women but increased
23% in diabetic women. These patterns were also found for all-cause mortality and
ischemic heart disease mortality.
Conclusions The decline in heart disease mortality in the general US population has
been attributed to reduction in cardiovascular risk factors and improvement in treat-
ment of heart disease. The smaller declines in mortality for diabetic subjects in the pres-
ent study indicate that these changes may have been less effective for people with
diabetes, particularly women.

tificate. The remaining 8869 subjects
(3826 men and 5043 women) were de-
fined as not having diabetes. The fol-
low-up period for cohort 1 was from the
date of the 1971-1975 interview to the
date of the self or proxy interview in
1982-1984. The mean follow-up was
9.1 years, during which time there were
264 deaths among subjects with dia-
betes and 1625 deaths among subjects
without diabetes.
Cohort 2
Of the 9233 subjects in NHEFS who
were aged 35 to 74 years on the date of
the self or proxy interview in 1982-
1984,therewere637subjects(233men
and 404 women) with diabetes. This
included 271 who had diabetes in the
1971-1975 survey and 366 who did not
have diabetes in 1971-1975 but stated
in the 1982-1984 interview that they
had been diagnosed as having diabe-
tes.Oftheremaining8596subjects,770
were excluded from analysis, includ-
ing 435 subjects who had a diagnosis
of diabetes made after the 1982-1984
interview, 10 subjects without diabe-
tes in 1982-1984 who died and had dia-
betes listed as a cause of death on their
death certificate, and 325 subjects with
unknown diabetes status. The remain-
ing 7826 subjects (2841 men and 4985
women)weredefinedasnothavingdia-
betes. The follow-up period for cohort
2 was from the date of the 1982-1984
interviewtothedateofdeathorthedate
of the last follow-up interview. The
mean follow-up was 8.7 years, during
which time there were 184 deaths
among subjects with diabetes and 747
deaths among those without diabetes.
Although all cohort 1 and cohort 2
memberswerepartoftheNHANESIsur-
vey, there was only a 3% to 8% overlap
in the 10-year age and diabetes groups
used in analysis. The lack of overlap
occurred because the beginnings of the

jects had diabetes in cohort 2 but not in
cohort 1.

age of the cohorts and the high pro-
portion of type 2 diabetes in the US
population with diabetes10,11 indicate
that the cohorts contained type 2 dia-
betes almost exclusively. Death due to
any heart disease or ischemic heart dis-
ease was based on the underlying cause
of death on the death certificates, which
were coded using the International Clas-
sification of Diseases, Ninth Revision.
Codes used for heart disease were 390-
398, 402, 404, 410-417, and 420-429,
and for ischemic heart disease, 410-
414. Death certificates were obtained
for 97.3% of decedents who had had
diabetes and 96.5% of decedents who
had not had diabetes.

3 age groups (35-54, 55-64, and 65-74
years) stratified by cohort, diabetes sta-
tus, and sex. The variance of the person-
year rate was estimated by the Chiang
method.12,13 Age-adjustedmortalityrates
for each cohort stratified by diabetes sta-
tus and sex were calculated by the di-
rect method, using four 10-year age
groups (35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65-74
years)andthe1980USpopulationasthe
standard. The variance of the age-
adjusted rate was calculated by sum-
ming the variance of each age-specific
rate multiplied by the square of its US
population proportion. The percentage
difference between cohort 1 and cohort
2 was calculated as the mortality rate in
cohort 2 minus the rate in cohort 1, di-
vided by the rate in cohort 1, and mul-
tiplied by 100. The variance of the per-
centage difference was estimated by a
Taylor series approximation for estima-
tion of the variance of a ratio from a
sample.14 Varianceoftherelativeriskwas
computed by the same method.

of death (P.01). For women without
diabetes, differences were statistically
significant only at ages 65 to 74 years
for all-cause and heart disease mortal-
ity (P.05). Among men with diabe-
tes, mortality rates in cohort 1 were gen-
erally higher than in cohort 2 at ages
35 to 54 and 55 to 64 years and were
slightly lower at ages 65 to 74 years.
Among women with diabetes, mortal-
ity rates in specific age groups tended
to be lower in cohort 1 than in cohort
2. However, 95% confidence limits
around the rates of diabetes for both
men and women were large, and no dif-
ferences between cohort 1 and cohort
2 were statistically significant for any
cause of death (Table 1 and Table 2).

1982-1984. Cohort 2 was defined in 1982-1984 and was followed up for mortality through 1992-1993. Details about sample sizes, number of deaths, point estimates,
and statistical significance are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Data are shown as percentage change in the age-adjusted mortality rates, with 95% confidence intervals. Per-
centage change was calculated as the mortality rate in cohort 2 minus the rate in cohort 1, divided by the rate
in cohort 1, and multiplied by 100. Details about sample sizes, number of deaths, point estimates, and statis-
tical significance are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

creases in the mortality rates for each
causeofdeath,rangingfroma19.7%de-

women with diabetes had increases in
their mortality rates that ranged from a
10.7% increase for ischemic heart dis-
ease to a 22.9% increase for heart dis-
ease. The percentage changes for sub-

FIGURE 4 shows the age-adjusted
relative risk for mortality (subjects with
compared with subjects without dia-
betes) in cohort 1 and cohort 2. The
relative risk was lower in cohort 1 than
in cohort 2 for each of the causes of
death in both men and women. The
smaller declines in mortality for men
with diabetes compared with men with-
out it and the increases in mortality for
women with diabetes compared with
women without it resulted in in-
creased relative risks for mortality as-
sociated with diabetes in cohort 2.
COMMENT
These data, based on nationally repre-
sentative samples of adults with and
without diabetes, indicate that mortal-
ity from all causes, heart disease, and
ischemic heart disease appears to have
decreased slightly for men with diabe-
tesduringtheperiod1971-1993andmay
have increased for women with diabe-
tes.Thedataalsoindicatethatadultswith
diabetesexperiencedlessdeclineintheir
mortality rates compared with the de-
cline experienced by adults without dia-
betes during this period. The lower de-
clinesforsubjectswithdiabetesoccurred
for all causes of death, heart disease, and
ischemic heart disease. However, confi-
dence limits around the mortality rate
changes for subjects with diabetes were
large and the magnitude of the changes
could not be determined precisely. In
contrast, there were large and statisti-
cally significant declines in mortality for
adultswithoutdiabetes,whichmirrorthe
changes in the general US population
found in other studies.1-4
The decline in coronary heart dis-
ease mortality in the US population has
been attributed to improvement in risk
factors for heart disease and improve-
ment in medical treatment of patients
with heart disease.15-17 These changes
have resulted in decreased incidence of
heart disease and increased survival of
patients.Basedonthesestudies,thereare
severalpossiblereasonsthatsmallermor-
tality declines among adults with diabe-
tes compared with adults without dia-
betes may have occurred. First, risk
factors for mortality, particularly heart
disease risk factors, may have de-
creased less over time in those with dia-
betes. Second, the incidence of coro-
nary heart disease, including the
incidence of recurrent myocardial in-
farction, may have decreased less in

diabetesmayhavebenefitedlessfromim-
proved medical treatment of heart dis-
ease, and case-fatality rates may have de-
clined less than in patients without
diabetes. Although NHANES I and
NHEFS do not have data to assess these
factors, there are extant cohort studies
that include subjects with diabetes that
could be investigated.
Two other recent studies examined
time trends in mortality for people with
diabetes.InRochester,Minn,10-yearsur-
vival of patients with type 2 diabetes in
1970and1980relativetosurvivalofthe
Minnesota white population was stud-

1980 cohort than the 1970 cohort, im-
plyingthatmortalityratesforwomenwith
diabetesinRochesterdecreasedlessthan
theratesforwomenwithoutdiabetes.Our
data indicate the same trend.
The other study of time trends in
diabetes mortality compared age-
adjusted mortality rates in the Pima In-
dians of Arizona in 1975-1982 with
rates in 1982-1989.19 For men, sub-
jects both with and without diabetes ex-
perienced small, nonsignificant de-
clines in all-cause mortality; for women,
subjects both with and without diabe-
tesexperiencedsmall,nonsignificantin-
creases in all-cause mortality.
In our study, there may have been
differences between the 1971-1975
cohort and the 1982-1984 cohort that
we could not measure that may have
accounted for the lower declines in
mortality for subjects with diabetes
compared with subjects without dia-
betes. In addition, the completeness
and accuracy of listing of heart disease
and ischemic heart disease on the
death certificate may have changed
during the 2 cohort periods. However,
the fact that the percentage changes
from cohort 1 to cohort 2 were similar
when multiple causes of death were
analyzed indicates that this may not
be a major reason for the lower de-
clines in mortality for those with dia-
betes. Coding of the underlying cause
of death was not a factor because the
same procedure to select the underly-
ing cause of death was used for all
deaths in the study.
Our study could not precisely dif-
ferentiate the types of diabetes, but
the adult age of the NHANES I cohort
and the high proportion of type 2 dia-
betes in the US population with diabe-
tes indicate that the results reflect
mortality in type 2 patients. Our data
also do not permit identification of
people with undiagnosed diabetes be-
cause neither fasting nor postchal-
lenge glucose samples were obtained.
Other studies have shown that mor-
tality rates for individuals with undi-
agnosed diabetes are approximately
equal to the rates for patients with di-
agnosed diabetes.20,21
In summary, this study indicates that
mortality rates for all causes, heart dis-
ease, and ischemic heart disease in men
and women with diabetes have not de-
creased to the extent that they have for
adults without diabetes. Many changes
have caused the declines in death rates
in the general US population. These
changes appear to have been less fa-
vorable or less effective for people with
diabetes, particularly for women. With
the increasing prevalence of diabetes in
the United States22 and the smaller de-
cline in mortality for these individu-
als, we anticipate that diabetes may
become an increasingly important fac-
tor for heart disease mortality in the
United States.
