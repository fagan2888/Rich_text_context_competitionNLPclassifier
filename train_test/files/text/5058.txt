Introduction
There is a consensus among those dealing with the English
writing of L1 Arabic users that the use of cohesive devices in
writing is one of the most difficult skills for those learners of
English to develop. Enkvist (1990) considered the achieve-
ment of cohesion in writing as an indefinable, obstruct, and
controversial concept which is difficult to teach and difficult
to learn.
Discourse unity, according to Tanskanen (2006), can only
be established via the use of cohesive devices that contribute
to text cohesion. Consequently, a text, according to Halliday
and Hasan (1976), is "any passage, spoken or written, of what-
ever length, that does form a unified whole" and "is best
regarded as a semantic unit" (p. 1). Halliday and Hasan (1976)
perceived cohesion as the only factor that distinguishes texts
from nontexts. This position was supported by Alarcon and
Morales (2011), who stated that cohesion refers to the linguis-
tic features which help make a sequence of sentences a text.
The mastery of cohesive devices is a crucial element of effec-
tive academic writing and essential for academic success in
any university program where English is the medium of
instruction. Consequently, the utilization of cohesive devices
in academic writing has attracted the attention of many
researchers who are endeavoring to address the issue of lack of
cohesion in students' writing, especially in those countries,
such as Oman, where English is taught as a foreign language.
A number of studies focusing on cohesive devices have
been conducted in different countries where English is taught
as a foreign language. Liu and Braine (2005) investigated
cohesive features in argumentative writing produced by 96
1st-year Chinese undergraduate students. The study showed
that students were incapable of using cohesive devices profi-
ciently in their writing. Thus, the authors stressed the need
for further research in the area of teaching writing to enhance
the awareness of students regarding the significance and
implementation of cohesive devices in their texts (Liu &
Braine, 2005). Xuefan (2007) analyzed the use of lexical
cohesive devices by 15 each of 1st- and 3rd-year English
majors from Wuyi University in China. The findings of the
study demonstrated that proficiency levels did not influence
the students' implementation of cohesive devices in their
writing. Furthermore, the researcher indicated that repetition
was more significantly used than other types of lexical cohe-
sion. Yang and Sun (2012) investigated the cohesive devices
in argumentative writing by 2nd- and 3rd-year undergraduate
Chinese EFL (English as a foreign language) learners at dif-
ferent proficiency levels. The researchers emphasized that
the writing quality of the students determined the appropriate
use of cohesive devices regardless of their EFL proficiency
levels. Crossley and McNamara (2012) examined

The Use of Cohesive Devices in
Descriptive Writing by Omani Student-
Teachers
Zuhair Abdul Amir Abdul Rahman1
Abstract
This study examines college-level Arabic L1 users' command of cohesive devices by exploring the extent to which Omani
student-teachers of English and native English speakers differ in their use of cohesive devices in descriptive English writing.
Halliday and Hasan's framework of cohesion was used to analyze the essays written by the two groups. A qualitative research
methodology was utilized to analyze the writing of the two groups to reveal the points of strengths and weaknesses in their
writing. The results of the study indicated that there was a notable difference between the natives' and the students' use of
cohesive devices in terms of frequency, variety, and control. While L1 English users' writing displayed a balance between the
use and frequency of various types of cohesive devices, the students overused certain types (repetition and reference) while
neglecting to use the others, thereby often, rendering their written texts noncohesive.

the possibility of predicting second language (L2) writing
proficiency through the use of different linguistic features.
The analysis included varied linguistic features that evaluate
text cohesion and linguistic sophistication. The study's cor-
pus consisted of 514 essays that were collected from graduat-
ing Hong Kong high-school students at seven different grade
levels. The study's analysis stressed the notion that profi-
ciency did not produce texts that were more cohesive, though
they constructed texts that were more linguistically
sophisticated.
In Saudi Arabia, Al-Jarf (2001) investigated the use of
cohesive devices by 59 Arab EFL students from King Saud
University. Substitution was deemed to be the most problem-
atic form of cohesion for the students followed by reference
and ellipsis. Furthermore, the outcome of the study also indi-
cated that "cohesion anomalies were caused by poor linguis-
tic competence, especially poor syntactic and semantic
awareness, and poor or inaccurate knowledge of the cohe-
sion rules" (Al-Jarf, 2001, p. 141).
In Egypt, Ahmed (2010) researched students' cohesion
problems in EFL essay writing. The participants in the study
were Egyptian student-teachers. The researcher concluded
that the low English proficiency of the students caused their
noncohesive writing.
In Nigeria, Olateju (2006) examined the use of cohesive
devices in the essays of 70 final-year students of Ooni Girls
High School in Osun State. The researcher concluded that
although the students had 6 years of intensive English
instruction at the secondary-school level, they lacked the
ability to properly use cohesive devices in their essays.
The phenomenon of cohesion and coherence in L2 English
writing has been the focus of attention for several researchers
in different nations. However, no research has been con-
ducted with Arabic L1 users in the Sultanate of Oman inves-
tigating Omani student-teachers' use of cohesive devices in
their written discourse. Moreover, to the best knowledge of
the writer, this study can be considered the first one that con-
ducts two types of comparison. First, it compares the writing
of two different levels of students in the same program to
examine whether proficiency level positively affects their
writing. Second, it compares the writing of native speakers
of English and the Arabic L1 students to identify how far the
two groups differ in the implementation of cohesive devices.
Specifically, the study was carried out to investigate the pro-
ficiency of 60 1st- and 3rd-year Omani student-teachers' use
of cohesive devices in their writing, and to identify how their
writing qualitatively differs from native speakers' regarding
the appropriate use of cohesive devices.
Theoretical Framework
Cohesion and Coherence
When one writes, he or she has to take a number of factors
into account. These factors include: making meaning from
available information, personal knowledge, and the cultural
and contextual frames around which the writer is situated. If
a native speaker of English hears or reads a passage of the
language which is more than one sentence in length, he or
she can normally decide without difficulty whether it forms
a unified whole or is just a collection of unrelated sentences
(Halliday & Hasan, 1976, p. 1). To use writing as a means of
communication, it is necessary to go beyond sentence-level
manipulation to the production of paragraphs and subse-
quently to multi-paragraph compositions. Once people are
involved in writing two or more interconnected sentences,
they have to use cohesive devices and coherence as a means
of linking sentences together. They should also have the abil-
ity to organize ideas into a unified whole. Cox, Shanahan,
and Sulzby (1990) supported the idea that cohesion is impor-
tant for the reader in constructing meaning from a text and
for the writer in creating a text that can be easily compre-
hended. Connor (1984) defined cohesion as the use of
explicit cohesive devices that signal relations among sen-
tences and parts of a text. This means that the appropriate use
of cohesive devices enables readers and listeners to capture
the connectedness between what precedes and what follows.
This means that the dependency of the linguistic elements on
each other in a text constructs a semantic unit. This shows
that connectedness is an indispensable element in any writ-
ten or spoken discourse. Consequently, linguists dealing with
discourse analysis have been striving to help students achieve
cohesion in writing.
Cohesion is usually thought of as one of the most crucial
defining characteristics of the quality of writing and thus has
been central in recent research. Witte and Faigley (1981)
asserted that the types of cohesive devices and their fre-
quency commonly reflect the invention skills of the writers
as well as the influence of the stylistic properties on the texts
they write. While some studies (Ahmed, 2010; Connor,
1984; Ferris, 1994; Jin, 2000; Normant, 2002; Reynolds,
2001; Witte & Faigley, 1981) found evidence of correlation
between cohesion and writing proficiency levels, other stud-
ies, such as Scarcella (1984) and Castro (2004), found con-
tradictory results.
The present writer, relying on his vast experience as a
teacher of English writing to Arab L1 users, suggests that
cohesion can be achieved if the writer of a text appropriately
uses a variety of well-placed cohesive devices that the text
requires. This opinion seems to be in keeping with the notion
stated by Salkie (1995) that cohesive devices play the role of
the glue that holds different parts of a text together. Increasing
the cohesion of a text facilitates and improves text compre-
hension for many readers (Gersbacher, Varner, & Faust,
1990). This connectedness of ideas in the text will definitely
create a cohesive whole text which facilitates the reader's
comprehension, particularly low knowledge readers
(McNamara, Kintsch, Butler-Songer, & Kintsch, 1996).
Any researcher, and the present writer is not an exception,
who wants to deal with cohesion will inevitably find himself
Rahman 3
or herself confronting the related notion, coherence. It is gen-
erally accepted in the literature that while cohesion is primar-
ily related to structural linguistics, coherence has been
studied with the fields of linguistics, discourse psychology,
and cognition science (Sanders & Maat, 2006), which all
focus on issues beyond the structures of a text. Malmkjaer
(2001) noted that "a coherent extended text is the result of
interaction between the reader's world and the text, with the
reader making plausible interpretations" (p. 549). Thus, a
reader or writer constantly endeavors to make sense of the
text depending on the shared background knowledge beyond
the text.
Though some researchers state that cohesion and coher-
ence are two faces of the same coin (Fitzgerald & Spiegel,
1986, 1990; McCulley, 1985), others deny any type of rela-
tionship between the two (Bamberg, 1984; Tierney &
Mosenthal, 1983; Witte & Faigley, 1981). This notion of
distinctness between cohesion and coherence is empha-
sized by Winterowd (1985), who stated that cohesion in a
text can be accomplished without coherence and vice versa,
depending greatly on the reader of the text. This notion was
supported by Oller and Jonz (1994), who stated that the use
of many cohesive devices does not necessarily create a
coherent and comprehensible text. To prove this, Enkvist
(1990) provided the example, "my car is black. Black
English was a controversial subject most people have
retired. To retire means `to put new tires on a vehicle.'
Some vehicles such as hovercraft have no wheels. Wheels
go round" (p. 12). Though cohesive devices, such as lexical
cohesion and repetition, are used, the text lacks coherent
meaning. On the contrary, a text with no cohesive devices
may be considered coherent as in the example presented by
Koshik (1999), "Someone came my house. Says give me
money. Husband take gun shoot. Go outside die. Call
police. Emergency 911. Policeman come. Take black man
go hospital die" (p. 11).
Despite the above concerns, the present paper's focus will
be on cohesion as the preponderance of evidence indicates
that the appropriate use of various cohesive devices in aca-
demic and descriptive writing ultimately leads to coherence.
Rationale of the Study
The personal motivation of the writer to deal with this sub-
ject stems from two sources. First, as a teacher of English
who has been working with Arabic L1 users for approxi-
mately 20 years, I have seen first-hand difficulties that L1
Arabic users face in English academic writing, especially in
utilizing cohesive devices which are fundamental to create
cohesively unified texts. Consequently, despite the fact that
Omani student-teachers have studied English for approxi-
mately 14 years at tertiary level, they have shown an evident
weakness in writing, in general, and in achieving cohesion,
in particular. Second, to the best knowledge of the writer, no
similar study has been carried out in the Sultanate of Oman.
Therefore, to improve the student's utilization of cohesive
devices, the writer set out to conduct this research aiming to
answer the following four questions:
1. What types of cohesive devices are used by Arabic
L1 student-teachers in their written discourse?
2. How frequently do those students use these cohesive
devices in their writing?
3. To what extent do these student-teachers differ from
native English speakers in the use of cohesive
devices?
4. What problems do these students face in using cohe-
sive devices to achieve cohesion?
Analytical Framework
Although researchers have identified several types of cohe-
sion (Brown & Yule, 1983; Cook, 1989; McCarthy, 1991;
Renkema, 1993), Halliday and Hasan's (1976) cohesion
framework was adopted in this study due to the comprehen-
siveness of its well-developed taxonomy. A cohesive device,
Halliday and Hasan (1976) noted, comprises two interrelated
elements that cross a minimum of one sentence boundary.
While one element is presupposing, the other is presupposed.
For instance, a pronoun is the presupposing element, while
its referent represents the presupposed element. Halliday and
Hasan (1976) stated that cohesion can be established by five
properties which are presented in Table1.
Method
This paper utilized qualitative research methodology, which
as Denzin and Lincoln (2000) argued, is achieved when
"qualitative researchers study things in their natural settings,
attempting to make sense of, or to interpret, phenomena in
terms of the meanings people bring to them" (p. 3).
Qualitative data produces a reliable view of the social setting
which suggests that "categories/representations produced
through research are socially and historically located and
subject to change" (Dunne, Pryor, & Yates, 2005, p. 50).
Participants
The study sample consisted of three groups. The first group
comprised 30 1st-year students who joined the English
department after they had finished their foundation year. The
second group consisted of 30 3rd-year students who had
already completed the foundation year and five semesters
during which they had studied several courses in writing and
discourse analysis. The 3rd group comprised 29 native
speakers of English who were working at Sohar University
in the Foundation Program and other faculties. None of these
participants was a professional writer.

Cohesive devices
1. Reference
Exophora Reference to a nonlinguistic element, e.g., (a teenager listening
to loud music) Father: Stop doing that, I want to read.
Endophora Anaphora

References to a preceding element, e.g., the firefighters know

Reference to an element that follows in discourse, e.g., I cannot
believe it. I am going to travel.
2. Substitution The use of pro-forms and pro-VPs to establish cohesion, e.g., the morning paper didn't carry a story about the
robbery, but the evening paper has one.
3. Ellipsis Cohesion can be established through ellipsis, which is to leave out a word or phrase rather than repeat it, e.g., I've
drunk a lot of coffee in my time, but this is the worst I've ever tasted.
4. Connectives

and, furthermore, for instance, likewise, etc.
yet, in fact, however, on the other hand, instead, etc.
so, therefore, as a result, because, etc.
then, first, second, third, finally, in conclusion, etc.
5. Lexical cohesion
Synonyms
Repetition
Superordinates
Antonyms
To achieve cohesion in texts, writers tend to use the same
words. Specifically content words, such as nouns, adjectives,
adverbs, and main verbs which are used by writers to help a
text to be coherent. For instance, the people of this country
aren't stupid. They know when politicians are lying to them.
They know when newspapers are not giving them the full
picture.
This method is used to avoid repeating exactly the same word
by using a word that is very close in meaning, for example,
"The doctor told me I'd been working too hard and I
needed at least six weeks off work to get my strength back."
Amanda's employer, however, was less sympathetic. "My boss
told me it was redundancy money--two weeks' pay--$280. I
was shocked."
Another way of creating cohesion is to refer back to a word
by using its superordinate. General words are referred to
as "superordinates" and the more specific ones are called
"hyponym." Such as, I love all dogs, especially Collies.
Antonyms, according to O'Grady, Dobrovolsky, and Katamba
(1996), are "words or phrases that are opposites with
respect to some components of their meanings" (p. 705). For
instance, that car is big, compared to the small one I have.
Research Design
The instrument used by the researcher to collect the data was
students' and natives' essays. The teachers of writing and
discourse analysis at Sohar University explicitly cover all
types of cohesive devices to encourage students to use them
in their writing so that they can achieve cohesiveness in their
texts. In all writing courses and discourse analysis at all lev-
els, the importance of this textual feature is stressed.
Subsequently, the three groups were asked to write an
essay of around 300 words on "A Day to Remember." This
topic was chosen among a large number of alternatives that
were deemed to be similar to the topics studied in class or
assigned in class, since it did not necessitate special back-
ground knowledge. All the subjects were given a week to
complete their task outside of class to offer them sufficient
time to think and write creatively. Moreover, to encourage
the students to write a well-written text, their writing teach-
ers told them that their texts would be assessed and given
marks. However, the students were encouraged to rely
entirely on themselves during the writing to give their teach-
ers the chance to be familiar with their mistakes in writing to
design some remedial work to improve it.
To answer the four questions previously mentioned, the
writer thoroughly examined the papers written by the stu-
dents as well as those written by native speakers.
Subsequently, all the correct cohesive devices that indi-
viduals in the three groups used were recorded. Then a
thorough comparison was conducted to find out how dif-
ferent or/and similar the groups were in implementing
cohesive devices in their writing to achieve a cohesive
whole text.

Discussion of Findings
To answer the first two questions of the study, Tables 2 and 3
are presented.
These two tables contain all tallies of the various types of
cohesive devices used by the two groups of students. A total
of 1,498 cohesive devices were used by all students to
achieve cohesive writing. Whereas 1st-year students used
784, 3rd-year students used 714. Considering the two per-
centages of the 1st- and 3rd-year students, it can be con-
cluded that the two groups do not vary greatly in the
frequency of their use of cohesive devices. This is despite the
longer period the latter have spent at the university during
which they studied "Advanced Writing 1," "Advanced
Writing 2," "Report Writing," and "Discourse Analysis." It is
of note that though 1st-year students used a larger number of
cohesive devices than 3rd-year students, this does not mean
that they are better at using cohesive devices to achieve
cohesion in their texts. When analyzing the writing of the
two groups, the writer arrived at the conclusion that the over-
use of certain cohesive devices by the 1st-year students
causes their writing to be more redundant and sometimes dif-
ficult to decipher.
Table 2 clearly shows that the most distinctive difference
between the two groups is in the use of repetition. While
1st-year students used this device 361 times, 3rd-year stu-
dents used it 264 times. This indicates that 3rd-year students
tended not to use repetition because of their extended knowl-
edge of writing, which elucidates the perception that repeti-
tion generally causes boredom to the reader. What attracts
the attention in the tables is the number of synonyms and
antonyms utilized by the two groups. Third-year students
should perform better here, because they should have a bet-
ter repertoire of synonyms and antonyms after the length of
time they have spent learning English. However, there is
little difference between the groups in terms of the use of
synonyms and antonyms.
Table 3 shows that the outstanding difference between the
two groups is in the use of reference. Whereas 1st-year stu-
dents used 212 personal and demonstrative pronouns, 3rd-
year students used them 284 times. This, of course, relates to
the phenomenon of repetition previously mentioned. Third-
year students are more capable than 1st-year students in
avoiding repetition by using personal and demonstrative pro-
nouns. Since 1st-year students do not yet have such ability in
the essays examined, they mainly resorted to repetition.
Although the two tables show some sort of difference
between the two student groups in the frequency and the
types of cohesive devices they used, the variance is not that
noteworthy. This suggested that proficiency of English of
these L1 Arabic using student-teachers does not positively
affect their use of English cohesive devices. This notion cor-
relates with findings of other studies such as Xuefan (2007),
Yang and Sun (2012), and Crossley and McNamara (2012).
Subsequently, the writer moves to answer the third ques-
tion to find out how far native speakers of English and Omani
student-teachers at Sohar University are similar or different
in the frequency and types of cohesive devices they used.
Table 4 illustrates the differences.
Although Witte and Faigley (1981) emphasized that "dis-
course is context bound-to the demands of the subject matter,
occasion, medium, and audience of the text" (p. 202), and
that there is no evidence of correlation between cohesive ties
and writing quality, they found in their study that highly
rated essays were generally defined by the rich density of
cohesive ties compared with low-rated essays. Consequently,
it should not come as a surprise to learn that native speakers,
who produced much better-written output than both groups
of students in this study's context, used significantly more
cohesive devices than both groups of students.

Figure 2. The use of lexical cohesion by the three groups of
participants.
Table 4 shows the difference in balance between lexical
cohesion and other types of cohesion. While the two percent-
ages of the first two groups in this table are rather close to
each other, the difference between them and the third group
is noticeable. This gives us the impression that student-
teachers use the four types of lexical cohesion (repetition,
synonyms, superordinates, and antonyms) more than the
native speakers. On the contrary, native speakers use the
other kinds of cohesive devices more than the lexical cohe-
sion. These results are parallel with the results presented by
Kafes (2012), who emphasized that lexical cohesion, specifi-
cally repetition, was predominantly used by Turkish students
in their English written essays. Mojica's (2006) study, which
investigated the academic writings of 30 Filipino graduate
English as a Second Language (ESL) students, indicated that
lexical cohesive devices were most frequently used by the
students. Moreover, Khalil (1989) also emphasized that Arab
students overuse lexical cohesion in their written work. This
phenomenon is further depicted in Figure 1.
This figure indicates that 1st- and 3rd-year students face
difficulties in appropriately using cohesive devices. However,
3rd-year students'performance is better because, unlike their
1st-year juniors they, to some extent, depend on a wider
range of cohesive devices significantly more than 1st-year
students who are rather fixated on lexical cohesive ties.
Hence, 3rd-year students are rather closer to native speakers
in using both types of cohesive devices than 1st-year stu-
dents (Table 5).
Table 5 shows the vast difference between the types and
numbers of cohesive devices used by the students and the
natives. While repetition represents 96.8% and 94.3% in the
writings of 1st- and 3rd-year students, respectively, all the
other three types of lexical cohesion in their writing comprise
only 3.2% and 6.7% correspondingly. This is quite different
from the percentages for the four types for native speakers
who, unlike the students, keep a sort of balance between the
uses of the four types. This obviously elucidates the fact that
student-teachers lack the repertoire of synonyms, antonyms,
and superordinates. Figure 2 captures this phenomenon.
As it was previously mentioned, English native speakers
tend to resort to using types of cohesion other than lexical
devices in achieving cohesion in descriptive texts. This is
evident in the three total percentages shown in table 6. What
is of note is the noticeable difference between the percent-
ages of connectives. While the English L1 users' percentage
is 46.4%, the percentages of the 1st- and the 3rd-year stu-
dent-teachers are 43% and 32.9%, respectively. This illus-
trates the fact that the English L1 users tend to use the four
types of connectives, additives, adversatives, causal, and
temporal more than the nonnatives speakers. These connec-
tives are commonly used by native speakers to relate what
follows to what precedes. The table also shows a vast differ-
ence between students' and natives' use of reference. While
the percentages of 1st- and 3rd-year students of reference
use are 51.6% and 56.4%, respectively, the English L1 lan-
guage users' percentage is 30%. This indicates that the stu-
dents are familiar with personal and demonstrative pronouns
which they tend to overuse to achieve reference in their
writing. Figure 3 depicts this phenomenon.
The tables, figures, and the discussion of results presented
give a clear answer to Question 4 of the study. Our analysis
clearly shows that student-teachers at Sohar University face
Figure 1. The use of cohesive ties by the three groups of
participants.

many problems in using cohesive devices in their writing.
The misuse of cohesive devices is a good indication that,
despite the lengthy period of time such students have studied
EFL and the courses they have taken to prepare them as
teachers of English in the Sultanate's schools, they still expe-
rience difficulties in writing English, especially with regard
to the achievement of cohesion. Table 7 is an analysis of the
writing of 10 random students.
This table supports what is stated in the presented tables
and figures that Omani student-teachers tend to use repeti-
tion and reference more than the other types of cohesive
devices. This results in the vast difference between their
writings and those of the natives. The following examples
represent instances of students'inappropriate use of cohesive
devices:
Two months before the league, we started preparing for this
league. We were very excited and waiting for this league. A
week before the league we had a meet with our couch telling us
about the main plan that we will do during the league. The
league was of two groups . . ..
I saw people waiting anxiously for their turn while some where
laughing with their friends and families. Some people where so
serious while some where relaxed. Some even slept on their
chairs while some preferred to read books . . .
I remember everything when my mother stayed in hospital. She
had a baby and my sister broke her leg. So my mother must sit
in hospital with her because she is only 5 days old. So she wants
a lot of care from my mother.

When I mix my memories, I can see a lot of good and bad
memories. But one of these memories has been diged in my
mind . . ..
The present research reveals that writing as a skill, should
be tackled in a totally different way. Textbook writers and
teachers whether at schools or departments of English should
devise alternative strategies for teaching cohesive devices to
equip their learners with the knowledge required to be com-
petent in writing cohesive whole texts.
The specific problems that students face when writing a
text in English can be summarized as follows:
1. The students overuse certain types of cohesive
devices, e.g. repetition, reference, and connectives,
while ignoring the other types. This overuse of par-
ticular cohesive devices is counterproductive, that is,
it results in tediousness and redundancy in their writ-
ten work.
2. The students do not achieve a balance between the
use of the various types of cohesive devices, that is,
they overuse some types and ignore others.
3. The problem that appears to be quite obvious to any-
one who goes through the students' writing is the
inappropriate use of the different types of cohesive
devices. This means that, in some cases, the students
use a certain cohesive device where it is not required.
In other cases, some parts of the text need cohesive
devices, but the students do not use them.
4. It seems obvious that the students are not familiar
with all types of cohesive devices to the same degree,
so they only utilize those that they are familiar with
because they find them easy to implement. Therefore,
they use repetition and reference in over abundance.
Pedagogical Implications
To help students improve their use of cohesive devices to
achieve better cohesion in writing, the writer recommends
several pedagogical implications. First, the types of prob-
lems stated above, especially the overuse of certain types of
cohesive devices, namely, repetition and reference, while
ignoring or misusing the others, encourage the writer to state
that the student-teachers are in urgent need of being taught
how to think in English while writing in English rather than
thinking and preparing their ideas in Arabic and then

transferring them into English. The negative transfer caused
by stylistic, rhetorical, educational, and cultural differences
leads to the appearance of incoherence in most of the texts
written by the student participants. What worsens the situa-
tion is that they are not aware that logic and rhetoric are not
universal, that is, rhetorical processes vary from one culture
to another. Despite the fact that some of the participants,
especially 3rd-year students, have mastered syntactic struc-
tures, they still demonstrate an inability to compose cohesive
texts. This fact has been asserted by Holes (1984), who stated
that though some of the texts written by the nonspeakers of
English are relatively free from gross grammatical errors,
they do not feel English.
To solve the aforementioned problem, the writer suggests
the students receive a great deal of exposure to English texts
written by native speakers which they can critically and ana-
lytically comprehend.
The persistent need for novel methods to teach writing,
whether in schools or universities, is due to the importance of
this skill as a thinking tool. This fact was asserted by Bjork
and Raisanen (1997) who argued:
We highlight the importance of writing in all university curricula
not only because of its immediate practical application, i.e. as an
isolated skill or ability, but because we believe that, seen from a
broader perspective, writing is a thinking tool. It is a tool for
language development, for critical thinking and, extension, for
learning in all disciplines. (p. 8)
In the light of what has been stated above, the writer sug-
gests a reconsideration of the place cohesion and cohesive
devices should occupy in the curriculum and the way teach-
ers deal with it, especially the employment of cohesive
devices to help their learners write effectively.
Second, the inappropriate use of cohesive devices by the
participants can be related to teaching methods. The writing
samples suggest that the students have not received sufficient
training in writing English which helped them become famil-
iarized with the rhetorical means of writing in that language.
Because teachers tend to rely on the deductive teaching of
writing mechanics and practice at the sentence level, stu-
dents do not write descriptive passages very often. Moreover,
teachers rarely intervene in the writing processes to guide or
help their students, with few of them providing detailed feed-
back on the written work done.
Third, there is a need for teachers of writing and discourse
to avoid focusing on the word and sentence levels, because
this will definitely result in noncohesive texts. Instead, they
have to go beyond structure-level analysis and focus on
whole texts which can shift the learners' attention to dis-
course features that are fundamental in achieving unity.
Fourth, exposing students to a wide range of cohesive
devices and the way they are implemented by native speakers
can help the students avoid overemphasizing certain types
and ignoring other types because over-reliance on one or two
strategies results in redundancy and misunderstanding.
Fifth, it has been shown by teachers of writing and dis-
course that teaching the various types of cohesive devices in
isolation does not help the learners to use them appropriately
in their writing (Heller, 1995; Hirvela, 2004). Therefore,
there is a need for teachers to focus on the way cohesive
devices are used in novels written by native speakers of
English where a demonstration of all those devices is made
manifest in writing. A teacher should also point out the
semantic consequences of particular patterns of language use
to help their students become fully aware of the organization
of relevant meanings in relation to each other in a text. In this
case, the students will become familiar with the crucial role
cohesive devices can play in the logical development of the
topic. This is supported by Heller (1995) and Hirvela (2004),
who stated that to enhance students' awareness of cohesion,
it is essential to incorporate reading activities into writing
classes. This enhances the students' awareness of the charac-
teristics of good writing, including cohesion.

Finally, teachers can motivate their students to enlarge
their repertoire of vocabulary which will help them use syn-
onyms, antonyms, and superordinates rather than overem-
phasizing repetition as it was indicated by the findings of this
study. An effective strategy suggested by Thurston and
Candlin (1998) and Yoon (2008) to enhance students' aware-
ness of lexico-grammatical patterning of text is to introduce
corpora to students. According to the two writers, corpus-
informed syllabi can be combined with writing courses. This
helps the students to solve their lexical problems through
concordances and collocation samples.
Taken as a whole, therefore, it becomes apparent that
explicit in-service teacher training is required for current
English language teachers to ensure they are aware of this
issue in their English writing and are trained to deal with it.
This has further implications for how trainee teachers are
taught how to teach writing which needs to be addressed in
Omani English language teacher training institutions.
Conclusion
In this study, Halliday and Hasan's (1976) cohesion frame-
work was adopted to analyze college students'use of cohesive
devices. The data of the study was qualitatively analyzed
through identifying the numbers and types of cohesive devices
used by the two groups (natives and nonnatives) and by evalu-
ating the overall quality of essays written by those two groups.
According to the discussion of results presented hereinbefore,
there is a vast difference between the natives'and the students'
use of cohesive devices in frequency, variety, and control.
While L1 English users kept a balance between the use and
frequency of various types of cohesive devices, the students
overused certain types (repetition and reference) and neglected
to use the others. This is certainly caused by lack of compe-
tence in their use of cohesive devices and their limited reper-
toire of vocabulary despite the fact that they have been exposed
to English reading and writing texts over many semesters.
Though the students tend to utilize only a limited range of
the many cohesive devices available, their texts appear to be
difficult to understand because even the few cohesive devices
they utilized were inaccurately used. The study reveals that
the misuse of cohesive devices is prominent in the writing of
these Arabic L1 students. This phenomenon not only creates
disorganized texts but also renders the content incomprehen-
sible to the reader.
The overuse of certain cohesive devices by the students
definitely causes redundancy in their writing and renders
their written texts difficult to decipher. The students might be
encouraged by their teachers of writing and discourse to use
as many cohesive devices as possible to create cohesive
whole texts. This, in turn, will certainly result in less redun-
dancy and incomprehension.
Furthermore, the students, unlike the English L1 users,
mainly focus on the word and sentence level and ignore the
relations of meaning that exist within the text. This linking is
achieved through relations in meaning that exist within and
across sentences. The result of this tendency is the absence of
connectedness which makes the flow of thoughts meaningful
and clear for readers. Cohesion gives a sequence of sentences
a coherent texture as it shows how semantic relationships are
set up by lexical and syntactic features.
As such, this study has shown the difficulty Omani stu-
dent-teachers of English commonly face in their English
descriptive writing, and how in particular their use of cohe-
sive devices is in need of attention. This conclusion is similar
to those of previous studies that investigated the use of cohe-
sive devices by students in the context where English is taught
as a foreign language. These studies include Khalil (1989),
Al-Jarf (2001), Liu and Braine (2005), Olateju (2006),
Mojica's (2006), Ahmed (2010), Yang and Sun (2012), and
Kafes (2012). Further research needs to be carried out to
examine the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching
these devices, as it is clear that the present approaches have
not equipped the students with the linguistic resources neces-
sary to write descriptive texts successfully.
