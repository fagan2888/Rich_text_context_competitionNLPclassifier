Betwixt And Between:
Targeting Coverage
Reforms To Those
Approaching Medicare
Should eligibility for a Medicare buy-in be based on age or ability
to pay?
by Dennis G. Shea, Pamela Farley Short, and M. Paige Powell
ABSTRACT: Recent Medicare buy-in proposals agree on setting eligibility at age
sixty-two but disagree on linking eligibility to loss of employer insurance or ability
to pay. We examine arguments for targeting incremental coverage for older
Americans in these ways. While access to retiree health insurance is declining,
we question whether targeting loss of employer insurance can address many
older Americans' insurance problems. Furthermore, focusing on persons ages
sixty-two to sixty-four misses a large group of persons in poor health with limited
resources. Efforts to improve coverage for older Americans should consider
trade-offs between defining eligibility by age versus ability to pay.
In each of the last three years of his presidency, Bill
Clinton proposed in his State of the Union message to allow
older Americans to buy into Medicare when they reach age
sixty-two. Until the third year, when Clinton introduced a general
25 percent tax credit to defray buy-in costs, the plan conspicuously
avoided government subsidies. All buy-in costs were to be borne by
enrollees. Even in its final iteration, the Clinton plan makes no
special provision for those who cannot pay for insurance. However,
Clinton does explicitly target "displaced workers" for assistance,
allowing people who lost their jobs and insurance because of plant
closings, company relocations, slack work, or the elimination of
their positions to buy into Medicare at their own expense after age
fifty-five. The final version of the Clinton plan also includes a general
tax credit to help former employees exercise their right to extend
employer insurance for eighteen months under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).1

and Marilyn Moon, also allows everyone ages sixty-two to sixty-
four to buy into Medicare. In contrast to the Clinton plan, the
Loprest-Moon proposal is specifically designed with subsidies ac-
cording to ability to pay (with free enrollment for the poor and
reduced premiums up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level).
There are no provisions in this plan for people who lose their jobs or
employer coverage.2
There seems to be agreement on setting the minimum eligibility
age at sixty-two for a Medicare buy-in but considerable disagree-
ment on linking eligibility to the loss of employer coverage or ability
to pay. Here we examine the arguments for and against targeting
assistance for older Americans in each of these ways.
Our findings rely on analysis of data from the March 1999 Current
Population Survey (CPS) and Waves 1 (1991) and 2 (1993) of the
Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). The surveys provide comple-
mentary information. The CPS offers a recent, cross-sectional look
at the insurance, employment, income, and health status of the
population nearing age sixty-five. The HRS, although less recent,
provides information about changes in insurance, employment, as-
sets, and income as persons approach age sixty-five.3 All differences
discussed in the text are significant at the p < .05 level or better.
Coverage Patterns By Age
There are good reasons for targeting the 62­64 age group, since
access to employer insurance is reduced as people approach age
sixty-five and retire. Consequently, older Americans rely most heav-
ily on individual insurance, which is expensive and limited for peo-
ple with serious health problems. Furthermore, because average
health expenses increase sharply with age (by 50 percent from the
45­54 age group to the 55­64 age group, according to unpublished
data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey), the group closest
to age sixty-five faces the greatest risk of being uninsured and being
charged the highest premiums in the individual market.
Despite these concerns, we do not find marked differences in
coverage by age that would require policymakers to draw the line at
age sixty-two. Retirement from full-time work peaks at age sixty-
two, when older Americans become eligible for Social Security (Ex-
hibit 1). However, in contrast with retirement rates, the disenroll-
ment rate from employer insurance across older age groups is flat.
This may partly be the result of lower retirement rates among persons
who would not be covered by employer insurance if they retired.4
n Job-based insurance. Overall enrollment in employer insur-
ance declines well before age sixty-two (Exhibit 2). Although en-
rollment in employer insurance in our 1998 data fell still farther

among the age 62­64 group, the health insurance differences before
and after age sixty-two were less dramatic than the employment
differences.
Furthermore, despite lower rates of employer insurance at older
ages, the percentage uninsured in the 62­64 and 55­61 age groups
was the same and only slightly higher than the percentage unin-
sured in the 50­54 age group. Even without a Medicare buy-in,
Medicare covered a large percentage of persons ages 62­64 under
existing disabled coverage and covered almost two-thirds of the
difference in employer insurance between persons in their early

fifties and early sixties. In addition, the gap in employer insurance
among those ages 62­64 was filled by increased individual insurance.
As a result, new policies that focus on persons ages 62­64 may
miss a large number of older persons who would benefit from cover-
age reforms. Little more than a quarter of the 1998 uninsured popu-
lation ages 55­64 were age sixty-two or older (about 0.9 million out
of 3.4 million), and fewer than a third of the individually insured in
this age group were age sixty-two or older (about 0.5 million out of
1.7 million).
These patterns raise additional issues about targeting the loss of
employer insurance. Partly because people retire only if they have
retiree benefits, the percentage of persons losing employer insur-
ance is relatively small (Exhibit 1). In the early 1990s employers
continued to cover more than four of every five insured persons who
quit working in their fifties and early sixties (HRS data not shown).
The differences we found in employer insurance by age still imply
that many older Americans successfully negotiate employment tran-
sitions with their insurance intact, but access to the benefits that
allow this transition is declining. However, since recent data sug-
gest that access to retiree coverage declined by more than 10 percent
from 1991 to 1998 among large employers, people may be more likely
to lose coverage at retirement in the future.5
Relatively few of the uninsured or individually insured at older
ages are people who recently lost employer insurance. In the early
1990s about two-thirds of uninsured persons ages 53­63 had been
without coverage for two years or more.6 More recent data also
indicate that more than half of uninsured persons ages 50­64 have
been uninsured for three or more years.7 Employers covered fewer
than one of every five uninsured persons in the HRS within the
preceding two years. After age sixty-two, more uninsured were re-
cent disenrollees from individual insurance (19 percent) than from
employer insurance (15 percent), and people who bought individual
insurance after age sixty-two were more likely to have been unin-
sured than to have lost employer insurance.8
n Policy implications. These statistics imply that offering rela-
tively short-term coverage extensions to people who lose employer
insurance, such as through COBRA or a Medicare buy-in, will miss
most of the uninsured and individually insured. Providing long-term
access to Medicare, beginning at a much earlier age than sixty-two,
could eventually fill the gaps between employer insurance and
Medicare for most people. However, such a policy would initially
miss people who had already lost employer coverage. Even in the
long run, focusing on people who leave employer insurance after age
fifty-five still misses a relatively large number of people in their early

fifties who are uninsured or individually insured (18 percent, ac-
cording to Exhibit 2).
Finally, targeting the loss of employer insurance helps a subgroup
that is economically better off than most of the uninsured. Accord-
ing to HRS data on persons ages 53­63 (not shown), more than
three-fifths who lost employer insurance between 1991 and 1993 had
incomes above 300 percent of poverty in 1993. In contrast, almost 40
percent of the long-term uninsured, who made up two-thirds of the
uninsured in 1993, had incomes under 150 percent of poverty.9
Ability To Pay And Health Insurance Reforms
Insuring people who are close to age sixty-five is expensive, even
through a Medicare buy-in. Analyses of Medicare buy-in proposals
suggest that annual premiums would be $3,000­$4,000.10 Older
Americans with incomes at 200 percent of poverty who had no
assets would have to spend about 20 percent of their resources, and
those at the poverty line would have to spend more than one-third of
their resources, on a Medicare buy-in premium. Thus, people with
limited resources are unlikely to participate without assistance.
Reforms that do not consider ability to pay will exacerbate the
existing economic disparities among older Americans. Coverage
patterns vary more widely by income than by any other factor (Ex-
hibit 3). The uninsured percentage in 1998 was more than four times
higher and employer coverage four times lower for people below
poverty than for people above 300 percent of poverty. Despite high
premiums, the poor enroll in individual insurance at almost twice
the rate as do those with incomes over 300 percent of poverty.
Furthermore, because the uninsured and individually insured are
concentrated at lower income levels, strategies that do not subsidize
older Americans with limited economic resources are likely to miss
a large percentage of the group who would benefit. If one considers
either the 62­64 or 55­64 age group, about half of the uninsured
have incomes below 200 percent of poverty.11
n Assessing financial status. While they point to economic
disparities, statistics relating insurance status to current income
probably understate the ability of some older Americans to pay for
insurance. Because many people in this age group have already re-
tired, current income may not be a good measure of economic status
or ability to pay. Even if there were agreement on targeting by ability
to pay, designing a consistent and accurate means test is challenging.
To explore this issue, we examine prior income and assets of
persons who turned age sixty-two between the first two waves of
the HRS. Thirty-seven percent of such persons with incomes below
poverty in 1993 had incomes above 200 percent of poverty in 1991

(Exhibit 4). This means that many persons ages 62­64 who would
qualify for free coverage under income-based subsidies would not
have qualified for subsidies before turning sixty-two.
Because enrollment in individual insurance is a sign of economic
advantage, the individually insured with low incomes are even more
likely than the uninsured to be better off. Considering the entire age
cohort covered by the HRS (data not shown), where the sample size
is sufficient to make these estimates, 60 percent of the individually
insured in poverty in 1993 had incomes in excess of 200 percent of
poverty in 1991, while almost two-thirds of the uninsured in poverty
in 1993 had incomes under 200 percent of poverty in 1991. The
individually insured between 100 and 200 percent of poverty were
twice as likely as the uninsured in the same income range to have
assets exceeding $100,000 (30 percent versus 14 percent). Given
these patterns, methods used to determine ability to pay may differ-
entially affect these two key groups.

Alternative Target Groups
A program that targeted individuals ages 62­64 and provided no
income-related subsidies would provide a source of low-cost group
insurance to uninsured and individually insured persons in this age
group. Three groups would primarily benefit. First, about 350,000
persons with individual insurance above 200 percent of poverty
might participate in a Medicare buy-in if its premium were lower
than their current private premium. This would depend on adminis-
trative costs, adverse selection, and other factors.
In addition, 190,000 individually insured persons with incomes
below 200 percent of poverty might also benefit from a Medicare
buy-in. They have shown their willingness to buy insurance, and the
buy-in might offer a cost advantage over their current coverage.
Finally, the 400,000 uninsured persons with incomes greater
than 200 percent of poverty might also benefit from an unsubsidized
Medicare buy-in. These people arguably have the means to pay for
health insurance. Lower premiums and the elimination of health-
related coverage limitations through a Medicare buy-in might en-
courage them to enroll. Given the cost of the unsubsidized Medicare
buy-in premium, it is unlikely that many uninsured persons below
200 percent of poverty would participate.
There are several important differences in the characteristics of
the three groups most likely to benefit from such a buy-in (Exhibit
5). While more than half of the individually insured with incomes
greater than 200 percent of poverty in 1998 were in excellent or very
good health, almost one-third of those with incomes below 200
percent of poverty were in fair or poor health. The health of the
uninsured above 200 percent of poverty most closely resembled that

of the individually insured at the same income level. Persons in both
groups above 200 percent of poverty were largely employed in 1998,
while just 22 percent of the individually insured under 200 percent
of poverty worked.
Adding income-related subsidies to a program for people ages
62­64, similar to those proposed by Loprest and Moon, would en-
courage participation by uninsured persons below 200 percent of
poverty. In most respects, the nearly 500,000 uninsured persons
with incomes below 200 percent of poverty were similar to the
individually insured at the same income level (Exhibit 5).
Extending eligibility to a younger age group, such as those ages
55­61, would greatly expand the size of the program. An additional
3.6 million uninsured or individually insured persons were in this
age group in 1998. Without targeted subsidies, the expanded pro-

gram would again attract uninsured and individually insured per-
sons with incomes above 200 percent of poverty. The higher-income
groups in both age groups in Exhibit 5 have similar characteristics.
A program with income-related subsidies that included the
younger age group would enhance participation among those below
200 percent of poverty. The health of those with low incomes in this
age group was similar to the health of those in the older age group
with the same insurance and income. While low-income persons
age 55­61 were more likely than their older counterparts to be work-
ing, they were also more likely to be poor.
A program that considered the larger age group (ages 55­64) but
restricted eligibility to persons with incomes below 200 percent of
poverty, similar to recent expansions of children's health insurance,
would target almost 2.5 million persons. As noted above, low-
income persons ages 55­61 were in as poor health as and had lower
incomes than low-income persons ages 62­64. The poor health of
this low-income group would result in much higher premiums com-
pared with programs that offered broader eligibility.
Discussion
Our results shed light on the merits of targeting assistance for older
Americans by age, income, and access to employer insurance. Our
findings raise several questions about each approach.
n Targeting those who lose employer insurance. The steady
erosion of employer coverage as people approach age sixty-five
means that a program targeting the loss of this coverage would reach
relatively few persons in the short run. Few currently uninsured or
individually insured persons have a recent history of disenrolling
from employer insurance. In addition, many older Americans retire
before age sixty-five without loss of employer insurance, so target-
ing this group may crowd out current private arrangements. Finally,
targeting those who lose employer insurance helps people who are
economically better off than people excluded by that strategy.
On the other hand, the current high rate of employer insurance
among retirees occurs partly because many people only retire if they
will have insurance afterwards. If retiree health benefits continue to
decline, some of these persons could pay for their own insurance at
little cost to the government if given access to group insurance or
Medicare. Furthermore, focusing on the loss of employer coverage,
as the Clinton plan does, may avoid crowding out private insurance.
Whether it is better to proceed with a relatively low cost program
that targets the upper middle class or a potentially more costly
program for the lower middle class is an ongoing debate.
n Targeting according to age. Our results suggest that age

sixty-two is not a critical threshold affecting insurance coverage.
Although insurance is more difficult to access and afford as indi-
viduals approach age sixty-five, the likelihood of losing employer
insurance or being uninsured is the same among persons age 55­61
as among persons ages 62­64. Coverage changes steadily through-
out the years approaching age sixty-five, rather than precipitously at
age sixty-two. Consequently, policies directed at persons ages
62­64 miss many older Americans who could benefit from access to
group insurance. In particular, it misses a large number of uninsured
and individually insured persons ages 55­61 below 200 percent of
poverty who are in as poor health as and have even lower incomes
than similar persons ages 62­64.
One problem with a lower eligibility age is the likely effect on
earlier retirement.12 Many policy analysts recommend incentives for
longer work lives as the baby boomers approach retirement. Target-
ing people at younger ages runs counter to current trends in Social
Security and raises further questions about the ability to fund health
and income security programs for future generations.
n Focusing on the poor. Focusing reforms on adults with lim-
ited economic resources is consistent with current incremental ex-
pansions targeted at the parents of children eligible for Medicaid or
the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).13 Although
targeting by ability to pay is difficult, the connection between abil-
ity to pay and insurance is dramatic in this age group. Furthermore,
persons below 200 percent of poverty, particularly the uninsured,
face more health problems than do others at the same age.
n Asset testing. To be fair and reliable, means testing during
early retirement might involve repeated or complicated income and
asset tests. In addition to the administrative expense, asset testing
penalizes persons who chose to save more during their working
years. Ideally, for persons in this age group, eligibility should be
based on some longer-term measure of productivity and earning
capacity. Such a test could be devised by considering lifetime earn-
ings data already compiled by the Social Security Administration.14
In addition to the administrative challenges, a means-tested pro-
gram, especially one that targeted persons ages 55­64, would re-
quire large subsidies because of low incomes and poor health in this
age group. Funding from general tax revenues or the current surplus
would have to be identified. The costs of such an expansion could be
"Focusing only on persons ages sixty-two to sixty-four misses a
group with significant health problems and limited resources."

prohibitive and could be even larger if the means-tested program
resulted in significant crowding out, as some research of Medicaid
expansions has suggested could occur.15
Thus, the connections between ability to pay and insurance in
this age group raise important questions about the appropriate
method of targeting incremental coverage reforms for Americans
nearing age sixty-five. Policies that merely allow older Americans to
buy into Medicare without income-related subsidies will not ad-
dress the insurance problems of those with limited economic re-
sources in this age group. At the same time, subsidies for older
Americans who lack access to group coverage are likely to be expen-
sive, because of the high health care costs and lack of economic
resources in this age group. As a result, limiting the program by age
is probably necessary to limit program costs.
However, focusing only on persons ages sixty-two to sixty-four
misses an important group of older Americans with significant
health problems and limited economic resources who also need ac-
cess to more affordable insurance. While a program open to every-
one ages fifty-five to sixty-four might be too costly, a means-tested
program that extended below age sixty-two could benefit a segment
of the population that has a genuine need for assistance. Since
policymakers have some flexibility in choosing an age cutoff that is
either older or younger than sixty-two, efforts to improve health
insurance for older Americans should give more careful considera-
tion to the trade-offs between defining eligibility by age versus abil-
ity to pay. In the spirit of incremental reform, initial eligibility for a
Medicare buy-in could be expanded over time by relaxing the means
test or lowering the age threshold, so that more older Americans
could benefit from Medicare.

could compare lifetime earnings to average poverty levels during the same
period and be provided to the Health Care Financing Administration. This
approach assesses long-term economic resources, is unaffected by retirement
decisions after the age when eligibility is determined, is easy to administer,
and does not encourage asset planning. One weakness may be an inability to
consider short-term, yet critical, economic reversals or the unique circum-
stances of older women who are divorced or widowed.
