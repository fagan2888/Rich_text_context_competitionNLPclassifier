Abstract This study assessed Kinsey self-ratings and life-
time sexual experiences of 17-year-olds whose lesbian mothers
enrolled before these offspring were born in the longest-run-
ning, prospective study of same-sex parented families, with a
93% retention rate to date. Data for the current report were
gathered through online questionnaires completed by 78 ado-
lescent offspring (39 girls and 39 boys). The adolescents were
askediftheyhadeverbeenabusedand,ifso,tospecifybywhom
and the type of abuse (verbal, emotional, physical, or sexual).
They were also asked to specify their sexual identity on the
Kinseyscale,betweenexclusivelyheterosexualandexclusively
homosexual. Lifetime sexual behavior was assessed through
questions about heterosexual and same-sex contact, age of first
sexual experience, contraception use,and pregnancy.The results
revealed that there were no reports of physical or sexual vic-
timizationbyaparentorothercaregiver.Regardingsexualorien-
tation, 18.9% of the adolescent girls and 2.7% of the adolescent
boys self-rated in the bisexual spectrum, and 0% of girls and
5.4% of boys self-rated as predominantly-to-exclusively homo-
sexual. When compared with age- and gender-matched adoles-
cents of the National Survey of Family Growth, the study off-
springweresignificantlyolderatthetimeoftheirfirstheterosex-
ual contact, and the daughters of lesbian mothers were signifi-
cantly more likely to have had same-sex contact. These findings
suggest that adolescents reared in lesbian families are less likely
than their peers to be victimized by a parent or other caregiver,
andthatdaughtersoflesbianmothersaremorelikelytoengagein
same-sex behavior and to identify as bisexual.

Introduction
Research has established that there are no significant differ-
ences in psychological well-being between the children of
lesbian and heterosexual parents (Bos, van Balen, & Van den
Boom, 2007; Gartrell, Deck, Rodas, Peyser, & Banks, 2005;
Golombok, 2007; Perrin & American Academy of Pediatrics,
Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family
Health, 2002; Tasker, 2005; Vanfraussen, Ponjaert-Kristof-
fersen, & Brewaeys, 2002, 2003), but there are very limited
dataonthe sexualorientation,sexualbehavior, and sexualrisk
exposureofadolescentsrearedsincebirthinwhatareknownas
planned lesbian families (Bos & Sandfort, 2010; Gartrell &
Bos, 2010; Golombok & Badger, 2010; Perrin, 2002).
The prevailingviewof sexual orientation is that it is shaped
byavarietyofdeterminants,includinggeneticinfluences,hor-
monal factors, and family environments (Golombok, 2000).
Empirical data suggest that genetics may play a role: Sibling
studies show more concordance in sexual orientation between
geneticallyidenticalmonozygotictwinsthanbetweendizygotic
twins or other siblings (Bailey, Dunne, & Martin, 2000; Ken-
dler, Thornton, Gilman, & Kessler, 2000; Langstrom, Rahman,

Carlstrom, & Lichtenstein, 2010). Extrapolating from these
findings, researchers have theorized that lesbian and gay par-
ents may have a higher proportion of biologic lesbian or gay
offspring as a result of shared genetic material (Goldberg,
2010). In terms of hormonal factors, high maternal levels of
androgens during pregnancy have been associated with more
same-sex attraction in offspring (Hines, Brook, & Conway,
2004). Among possible environmental influences, growing up
in a same-sex parent household may broaden offspring's
considerationofpossiblesexualidentitiesbecause lesbian and
gay parents are less likely to stigmatize same-sex attraction
and relationships, and they are more likely to discuss issues
relatedtosexualitywiththeiroffspring(Bos&Sandfort,2010;
Fulcher, Sutfin, & Patterson, 2008; Goldberg, 2010; Tasker,
2005).AsStaceyandBiblarz(2001;seealsoBiblarz&Stacey,
2010) theorize, the adolescent offspring of same-sex parents
may be more comfortable exploring homoerotic attractions
thanyouthwhogrowupinheterosexualhouseholdsbecauseof
the social environment created by their parents.
Another claim about the origins of sexual orientation that
has been put forth in litigation and public discourse by oppo-
nents of equality in marriage, adoption, and foster care for
same-sex couples is that lesbian and gay parents are more
likely to abuse their children sexually (Arkansas Department
ofHumanServices,2010;Ford,2010),andthatthisabusewill,
in turn, result in their offspring identifying as lesbian or gay
themselves (Biblarz & Stacey, 2010; Committee on Lesbian,
Gay, and Bisexual Concerns, Committee on Children, Youth,
and Families, Committee on Women in Psychology, 2005;
Falk, 1989; Golombok & Tasker, 1994; Jenny, 1994; Patter-
son,1992;Thompson,2002).Althoughnostudiestodatehave
investigatedintrafamilialsexualabuseofadolescentsrearedin
planned same-sex parent households, a growing body of
research has found that lesbian and gay adults, most of whom
grew up in heterosexual households, report higher rates of
childhood sexual victimization than their heterosexual peers
(Balsam,Lehavot,Beadnell,&Circo,2010;Balsam,Rothblum,
& Beauchaine,2005; Wilson& Widom,2010).The authorsof
these studiesreportinga correlationbetween childhood sexual
abuse and adult same-sex attraction and/or behavior urge
caution in the interpretations of their findings, suggesting that
a child's same-sex attraction could have preceded the abuse
or that young children who demonstrate same-sex attraction
may be specifically targeted for abuse (Balsam et al., 2005;
Faulkner & Cranston, 1998; Wilson & Widom, 2010).
Although the sexual orientation and behavior of adoles-
cents and adults reared by same-sex couples has garnered
considerableattentioninresearchandpublicpolicy(Arkansas
Department of Human Services, 2010; Supreme Court of
Iowa, 2009; United States District Court Northern District of
California San Francisco Division, 2010), the only data on the
sexual preferences and experiences of the offspring of lesbian
mothers come from two empirical studies of young adults
(Golombok & Badger, 2010; Golombok & Tasker, 1996;
Golombok,Tasker,&Murray,1997;MacCallum&Golombok,
2004; Tasker & Golombok, 1995).
The first report on the sexual orientation of adults who had
been reared by lesbian mothers was based on data collected in
1991­1992 in the United Kingdom by Golombok and Tasker
(1996; see also Tasker & Golombok, 1995). Twenty-five adult
offspring (17 women and eight men) of lesbian mothers and
21 adult offspring (nine women and 12 men) of heterosexual
mothers were interviewed. This study was a follow-up to a sur-
vey of their mothers conducted in 1976­1977. In the lesbian
families, the offspring had been conceived in heterosexual
relationships before their mothers divorced and identified as
lesbian. The average age of the adult offspring in the follow-up
study was 23.5years. Golombok and Tasker found no signifi-
cant differences between the groups of lesbian- and heterosex-
ual-parented offspring in the percentage who self-identified
as lesbian or gay or in reports of sexual attraction. Golombok
and Tasker did, however, find that six of the young adults (five
females and one male) raised by lesbian parents reported a
sexualexperiencewithsomeoneofthesamegender,whilenone
of the young adults raised by heterosexual mothers did. Addi-
tionally, only the adult daughters (and no adult sons) of lesbians
expressed a significantly greater openness to the idea of same-
sex attraction in the future.
InasecondBritishstudy,plannedlesbianfamilieswerecom-
pared with solo heterosexual mother families and two-parent
heterosexual families (Golombok & Badger, 2010; Golombok
et al., 1997; MacCallum & Golombok, 2004). All of the lesbian
mothers identified as lesbian before the birth of the child
enrolledinthisstudy.Thefirstinterviewstookplacewhenthese
offspring were, on average, 6years of age. The offspring were
surveyed again as young adults (M=19years; range, 18­19.5)
(Golombok & Badger, 2010). It was found that the 18 young
adults with lesbian mothers were more likely to have started
dating than the 32 young adults from two-parent heterosexual
families; all those reared by lesbian mothers identified as het-
erosexualwiththeexceptionofoneyoungwomanwhoreported
that she was bisexual.
Two other studies have explored sexual orientation, sexual
behavior, and ideas about sexuality in female-headed house-
holds(Bos& Sandfort,2010; Wainright,Russell,& Patterson,
2004).Wainrightetal.analyzeddataon4415-year-oldsreared
infemale-couplehouseholds(parentalsexualorientationunknown
and planned family status unknown) collected in the 1994
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Wainright
et al. compared the adolescents from these same-sex-parent
households to 44 age-matched adolescents raised in hetero-
sexual-parent households and found no significant differences
inself-reportsofheterosexualintercourse,sexualattraction,or
romantic relationships. In a recent study of planned lesbian
families in the Netherlands, Bos and Sandfort (2010) com-
pared the offspring, ranging in age from 8 to 12years, from 63

planned lesbian families to the offspring from 68 heterosexual
families.Thechildrenoflesbianmotherswerelesscertainabout
the prospect of future heterosexual involvement. This finding
does not necessarily equate with future sexual orientation or
behavior, but it fits with the theory proposed by Biblarz and
Stacey (2010) and Stacey and Biblarz (2001) and the evidence
presentedinGolomboket al. (1997) that childrengrowingupin
lesbian-parent households may be more open to the possibility
of same-sex relationships in the future.
The U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study
(NLLFS) provides an opportunity to fill gaps in the literature
about the offspring of planned lesbian families. The NLLFS
wasinitiatedin1986toprovideprospective data ona cohortof
lesbian families from the time the children were conceived
until they reach adulthood. The first NLLFS interview (T1)
(Gartrell et al., 1996), conducted with inseminating or preg-
nant prospective mothers, found that the children were highly
desired. The study participants, who were completely open
about being lesbian, hoped that their families of origin would
welcome the child even though some family members had
concerns about children being raised by lesbians. The second
interview (T2) (Gartrell et al., 1999) took place when the
NLLFS children were 2-years-old. Child-rearing responsi-
bilities were typically shared in two-mother households. Most
childrenhadacceptinggrandparentswhohadbecomecloserto
the family since the child's birth. At T3 (Gartrell et al., 2000),
the 5-year-old index children were reported to be healthy,
well-adjusted, and relating well to peers. The NLLFS families
were integrated into their neighborhoods and participating in
the lesbian community. When the NLLFS offspring were 10
(T4) (Gartrell et al., 2005) and 17 (T5) (Gartrell & Bos, 2010),
standardized tests completed by their mothers revealed that
their offspring had no higher incidence of psychological or
developmental problems than age-matched peers in the com-
parison samples. Also at T4, the NLLFS mothers reported that
none of their offspring had been physically or sexually abused
by a parent or other caregiver (Gartrell, Rodas, Deck, Peyser,
& Banks, 2006; Gartrell et al., 2005).
The first goal of the current investigation was to survey the
17-year-old NLLFS offspring about their sexual orientation,
sexual behavior, and sexual risk exposure. The second goal
was to compare the sexual behaviorof the NLLFSadolescents
withthe sexualbehavior reportedbyage-matched adolescents
in national probability samples.
Method
Participants
The data for this report were collected between 2005 and 2009
as part of the NLLFS, an ongoing longitudinal study of 84
planned lesbian families that began in 1986 and has a 93%
retention rate to date. The sample consisted of 39 adolescent
girls and 39 adolescent boys who were conceived through
donor insemination. Their mothers enrolled in the NLLFS
between 1986 and 1992 while inseminating or pregnant with
these index offspring (for a full description of sampling and
data collection procedures, see Gartrell & Bos, 2010; Gartrell
et al., 1996, 1999, 2000, 2005). At T5, after consent had been
obtained from the mothers for the participation of their off-
spring, the 17-year-old NLLFS adolescents were contacted,
who also provided assent. The adolescents were assured that
their responses would be kept confidential. Approval for the
NLLFS has been granted by the Institutional Review Board at
the California Pacific Medical Center.
Since one family did not complete all portions of the T5
survey instruments, the total N used for the analyses was 77
families with 78 adolescents, including one set of twins. Demo-

Table1. At T5, the family constellations consisted of 31 con-
tinuously-coupled, 40 separated-mother, and six single-mother
families. Of the 73 couples who were co-parenting when the
index offspring were born, 56% had separated, and the average
ageoftheindexoffspringatthetimeoftheirmothers'separation
was6.97years(SD=4.42years).Therewasasignificantdiffer-
ence between the parental divorce rate (36.3%) of the 17-year-

Measures
The NLLFS adolescents completed an online questionnaire
that wasprovidedand returnedthroughthestudy'ssecure Web
site. Abuse was measured by the following questions: ``Have
you ever been abused?''(1=no, 2=yes);``If yes, please indi-
cate by whom (e.g., parent, stepparent, relative, friend, stran-
ger, etc.), and for each incident, specify the sex of abuser and
the type of abuse (verbal, emotional, physical, sexual).'' The
NLLFS adolescents were also asked: ``How do you identify
sexually? (Please check one)'': (0=exclusively heterosexual;
1=predominantly heterosexual, incidentally homosexual; 2=
predominantly heterosexual, but more than incidentally homo-
sexual; 3=equally heterosexual and homosexual; 4=pre-
dominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosex-
ual; 5=predominantly homosexual, incidentally heterosexual;
6 = exclusively homosexual) (Sell, 1997). Lifetime sexual
behavior was assessed through items focusing on heterosexual
and same-sex contact, age of first sexual experience, contracep-
tion use, and pregnancy (for specific questions, see Table2).
Data Analysis
For the victimization self-reports and the Kinsey self-ratings,
simple frequencies were calculated. In comparing the sexual
behavior of NLLFS adolescent girls and boys, chi-square
analyses were conducted for discrete variables and t-tests for
continuous measures.
To compare sexual behavior in the NLLFS adolescent
sample with a national probability sample, the 6th Cycle of the
NSFG was used (see Table 2) (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 2005, 2006). The NSFG data were weighted
toensure thatthesample wassimilar totheUnitedStatespopu-
lation in terms of gender, age, and race/ethnicity. The NSFG
questionsonsexualbehaviorwereadministeredthroughAudio
Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing, which ensured privacy
byallowingthe participanttoentertheresponsesdirectlyintoa
computer. With permission of the National Center for Health
Statistics (A. Chandra & G. Martinez, personal communica-
tion, December 4, 2009), the 17-year-old adolescents in the
NSFG were selected, consisting of 235 girls and 199 boys. For
these 17-year-old NSFG adolescents, weighted frequencies
and means were computed for the variables in Table2. Cross-
tabulations and chi-square analyses were used to compare the
17-year-old NLLFS participants with the age-matched NSFG
group (weighted data) on: (1) heterosexual contact, same-sex
contact, and the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections
(separately for adolescent girls and boys); (2) contraception
andpregnancy(onlyforadolescentgirls);and(3)impregnation
(only for adolescent boys). T-tests were used to compare the
NLLFS and the NSFG adolescents (weighted data) on the age
of first heterosexual contact, separately by gender.
Results
Victimization
Withrespecttovictimization,oneNLLFSadolescentgirl(2.6%
of the girls) indicated that she had been verbally abused by a
stepmother. None of the NLLFS offspring reported physical or
sexual abuse by a parent or other caregiver.
Kinsey Self-Ratings
In the NLLFS sample, no significant gender differences were
foundwhenthe37adolescentgirlsand37adolescentboyswho
self-identified sexually on the Kinsey scale were compared
(see Table 3). However, a significant difference was found
when gender comparisons were conducted by collapsing the
Kinseyscale intothree categories: (1) Kinsey0­1,exclusively
heterosexual/predominantly heterosexual, incidentally homo-
sexual; (2) Kinsey 2­4, predominantly heterosexual, but more
thanincidentallyhomosexual/equallyheterosexualandhomo-
sexual/predominantlyhomosexual,butmorethanincidentally
heterosexual;and(3)Kinsey5­6,predominantlyhomosexual,
incidentally heterosexual/exclusively homosexual. Eighty-
one percent of the girls and 91.9% of the boys identified as
Kinsey 0­1; 0% of the girls and 5.4% of the boys identified as
Kinsey 5­6. The NLLFS adolescent girls were significantly
more likely than the adolescent boys to have identified in the
Kinsey2­4bisexualspectrum:girls,18.9%,versusboys,2.7%
(v2 =6.75, p = .034).
Sexual Behavior
Lifetime experiences ofheterosexual and same-sexcontact are
shown separately for the NLLFS adolescent girls and boys in
Table3.WhentheNLLFSadolescentsamplewascomparedby
gender with the NSFG 17-year-old sample, the NLLFS ado-
lescent girls and boys were significantly older than their gen-
der-matched peers in the NSFG at the time of their first
heterosexualcontact(see Table4).Ofthosewhoweresexually
active (NLLFS girls=61.5% and NLLFS boys=43.2%;
NSFG girls=64.1% and NSFG boys=60.1%), NLLFS ado-
lescent girls were significantly more likely to have had sexual
contact with other girls, more likely to have used emergency
contraception, and less likely to have used other forms of

contraception, than NSFG adolescent girls. The NLLFS ado-
lescent boys were significantly less likely to have been het-
erosexually active by the age of 17 than NSFG boys (see
Table4).
In a separate analysis of lifetime sexual behavior, the
NLLFS adolescents were compared by gender. There were no
significant differences in the percentages of NLLFS adoles-
cent girls and boys who were sexually active, v2(1, N = 76) =
2.55. There were also no significant gender differences in the
percentages of NLLFS offspring who reported heterosexual,
v2(1, N = 76) = 1.96, or same-sex behavior, v2(1, N = 75) =
1.90, nor in the mean age of their first heterosexual contact
(t = 1.03).
Discussion
A key finding in the current study was that none of the NLLFS
adolescents reported physical or sexual abuse by a parent or
other caregiver. This finding contradicts the notion, offered in
oppositiontoparentingbygayandlesbianpeople,thatsame-sex
parents are likely to abuse their offspring sexually (Arkansas
Department of Human Services, 2010; Falk, 1989; Ford, 2010;
Golombok & Tasker, 1994; Patterson, 1992). The NLLFS ado-
lescents'lackofexposuretoparent/caregiverabuseisconsistent
with their mothers' reports at T4 (Gartrell et al., 2005), but con-
trasts with the self-reports of same-age adolescents in the U.S.
NationalSurveyofChildren'sExposuretoViolence(Finkelhor,
Ormrod,&Turner,2009a;Finkelhor,Turner,Ormrod,&Hamby,
2009b; Finkelhor, Turner, Ormrod, Hamby, & Krack, 2009c).
In the 17-year-old weighted subsample of the U.S. Office of
JuvenileJusticeandDelinquencyPrevention'sNationalSurvey
of Children's Exposure to Violence (NATSCEV) (Finkelhor
et al., 2009a, b, c), it was found that the lifetime rates of victim-
izationbyaparentorothercaregiverwere:26.1%ofadolescents
had been physically abused and 8.3% sexually assaulted (D.
Finkelhor, personal communication, March 13, 2010).
One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the
NLLFS adolescents' reports regarding abuse and the NAT-
SCEVvictimizationdatamightbethatmostoftheNLLFSado-
lescentsgrewupinhouseholdsinwhichnoadultmalesresided.
Since the sexual abuse of children that occurs within the home
is largely perpetrated by adult heterosexual males (Balsam
et al., 2005; Turner, Finkelhor, & Ormrod, 2007; Peter, 2009;
Putnam, 2003; Shusterman, Fluke, McDonald, & Associates,

an association between corporal punishment and other types of
abuse (Gershoff, 2002; Sunday et al., 2008; Zolotor, Theodore,
Chang,Berkoff,&Runyan,2008).Becausethisisthefirststudy
to document lifetime parent/caregiver abuse through the self-
reports of adolescents in planned lesbian families, it will be
interesting to see whether future studies of same-sex parented
families yield similar results.
Since the 1970s, when lesbians began to seek legal custody
of their children at the time of divorce, expert witnesses have
been askedwhether childrenrearedbysame-sexparentsmight
be more likely to identify as lesbian or gay in adulthood (Gol-
ombok et al., 2003; Tasker, 2005; United States District Court
Northern District of California San Francisco Division, 2010).
Thepresentstudyfound that nearly 20% ofNLLFS adolescent
girls rated themselves in the Kinsey bisexual spectrum, and
none identified as predominantly-to-exclusively lesbian. The
NLLFS adolescent girls were also more likely than the age-
matched NSFG girls to have engaged in same-sex activity.
Among17-year-oldNLLFSadolescentboys,2.7%self-identi-
fied in the bisexual spectrum, and 5.4% as predominantly or
exclusivelyhomosexual.However,theNLLFSadolescentboys
were no more likely to have engaged in same-sex behavior than
were the boys in the NSFG sample.
The NLLFS adolescent girls' Kinsey self-identifications
and lifetime sexual experiences were consistent with Stacey
and Biblarz's (2001) and Biblarz and Stacey's (2010) theory
that the offspring of lesbian and gay parents might be more
open to homoerotic exploration and same-sex orientation.
Although the Golombok and Tasker (1996) study found no
significant differences in the percentages of adults reared in
lesbian and heterosexual households who reported same-sex
attraction or orientation, the offspring of lesbian mothers were
more likely to have engaged in same-sex behavior and to have
grownupinhouseholdscharacterizedbyacceptanceoflesbian
and gay relationships (Golombok & Tasker, 1996; Tasker &
Golombok, 1995). In the NLLFS, the adolescent offspring
were born into families headed by mothers who were com-
pletely open about their lesbian orientation and active partic-
ipants in the lesbian community (Bos, Gartrell, Peyser, & van
Balen, 2008a; Bos, Gartrell, van Balen, Peyser, & Sandfort,
2008b; Gartrell & Bos, 2010; Gartrell et al., 1996, 1999, 2000,
2005, 2006). Perhaps this type of family environment made it
more comfortable for adolescent girls with same-sex attrac-
tionstoexploreintimaterelationshipswiththeirpeers(Biblarz
& Stacey, 2010; Stacey & Biblarz, 2001).
No significant differences were found between the NLLFS
adolescentgirls and boys onKinsey self-identifications. How-

boys to rate themselves in the bisexual spectrum. Research has
documentedconsiderablefluidityinthedevelopmentandexpres-
sion of sexual orientation, particularly among young women
(Diamond,2005,2007;Diamond&Butterworth,2008).Ina10-
year study of nonheterosexual women between the ages of 16
and 23, Diamond (2007) asked women how they identified in
terms of their sexual orientation, including the terms``lesbian,''
``bisexual,''``unlabeled,''or``heterosexual.''Diamond found
over the course of 10 years, two-thirds of women had changed
their identity label at least once, and one-quarter had changed
their identity label more than once. The next NLLFS follow-
up--at T6, when the offspring are 25years old--will assess the
stability of their sexual behavior and orientation over time.
The finding that the NLLFS sample was older than the
NSFG sample at the time of first heterosexual experience may
beassociatedwiththe absenceofpregnanciesandSTIsamong
sexually-active NLLFS adolescents. Research suggests that
the timing of heterosexual intercourse and the pace at which
adolescents progress to more intimate behaviors are related to
health outcomes (Cavazos-Rehg et al., 2008; de Graaf, Van-
wesenbeeck, Meijer, Woertman, & Meeus, 2009). It is note-
worthy that among the sexually active adolescent girls, even
thoughmoreoftheNSFGsamplethantheNLLFSsampleused
contraception, 18.2% (weighted data) of the sexually active
NSFG girls had been pregnant. None of the NLLFS girls
reported pregnancy, possibly due to their greater reliance on
emergency contraception. The difference in the methods of
contraception chosen by the two samples could be explained
bynumerousfactors,includingeconomicresourcesandparen-
tal, peer, and school support.
The rate of parental relationship dissolution was signifi-
cantly higher in the NLLFS than in the NSFG. Although the
offspring of divorced heterosexual parents have been shown to
score lower on measures of emotional, academic, social, and
behavioral adjustment (Amato, 2000; Emery, 1999), no dif-
ferences in psychological adjustment were found when the
17-year-old NLLFS adolescents whose mothers had separated
were compared with those whose mothers were still together
(Gartrell & Bos, 2010). In addition, on the standardized Child
Behavior Checklist, the daughters and sons of lesbian mothers
were rated significantly higher in social, school/academic, and
total competence, and significantly lower in social problems,
rule-breaking, aggressive, and externalizing problem behavior
than their peers in the normative sample of American youth
(Gartrell & Bos, 2010). Whereas 65% of divorced American
heterosexual mothers retain sole physical and legal custody of
theirchildren(Emery,Otto,&O'Donohue,2005),custodywas
shared in nearly three-quarters of the NLLFS separated-parent
families. Studies show that shared childrearing after parental
relationship dissolution is associated with more favorable out-
comes (Emery, 1994, in press). Consistent with the favorable
psychological profiles of the NLLFS 17-year-olds, there were
no reports of pregnancy or STIs among these offspring.
A strength of the NLLFS is that it is a prospective study, so
the findings are not skewed by overrepresentation of families
who volunteer when it is already clear that their offspring are
functioningwell.Inaddition,thedropoutratewasverysmall.In
mostcases,thefamiliesthatwithdrewdidsowhentheindexchil-
dren were less than 5 years old (Gartrell & Bos, 2010; Gartrell
et al., 2000, 2006). Also, the T5 data were gathered through
confidential adolescent self-reports, thereby increasing the like-
lihood of candid responses on sensitive topics, such as sexuality
and victimization. Because the NLLFS is an ongoing longitu-
dinal study, it is possible to assess consistency in behavior at
different time intervals. In the current investigation, adolescents
were only asked to provide information about their sexual iden-
tity on the Kinsey scale. At T6, the offspring will be asked to
provide more detail about sexual identity, fantasy, and behavior
inrelationtoorientation(Drummond,Bradley,Badali-Peterson,
& Zucker, 2008; Green, 1987; Zucker & Bradley, 1995).
Despite these strengths, the NLLFS has several limitations.
First, it is a nonrandom sample. At the time that the NLLFS
beganinthemid-1980s,duetothelonghistoryofdiscrimination
against lesbian and gay people, the prospect of recruiting a
representative sample of planned lesbian families was even
more remote than it is today (Bos et al., 2007). A second limi-
tation is that the NLLFS and NSFG were neither matched nor
controlled for socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, or region of
residence. An analysis of a more economically diverse sample
wouldbeanimportantcontributiongiventhatsame-sexcouples

household incomes than married, heterosexual couples raising
children(Albelda,Badgett,Schneebaum,&Gates,2009;Julien,
Jouvin, Jodoin, l'Archeveque, & Chartrand, 2008). In addition,
now that it is possible to obtain more information about sperm
donors, future studies might benefit from exploring the associ-
ation between the offspring's sexual orientation and that of both
parents. Finally, although the NLLFS is the largest, longest-
running prospective study of planned lesbian families, the find-
ings would be strengthened by replication in a larger sample.
The present study contributes a unique dimension to the lit-
erature on same-sex-parented families in reporting on the life-
time sexual experiences among 17-year-old adolescents who
were conceived by donor insemination and born into planned
lesbianfamilies.Tothebestofourknowledge,thecurrentinves-
tigation is the first to document parent/caregiver victimization
experiences among adolescents reared by lesbian mothers.
There was a noteworthy absence of parental/caregiver physical
and sexual abuse in the self-reports of adolescents with lesbian
mothers. Because victimization of children and adolescents is
pervasiveandcancauselastingphysical,mental,andemotional
harm (Finkelhor et al., 2009a, b, c; U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, 2009), a more in-depth exploration of the
ways that lesbian mothers protect their offspring from abuse is
warranted. To the extent that these findings are replicated by
other researchers, these data have implications for healthcare
