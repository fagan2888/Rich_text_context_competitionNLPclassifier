Background: Obesity interventions are implemented at state or sub-state level in the United States (US), where only self-
reported weight and height data for adults are available from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The
prevalence estimates of overweight and obesity generated from self-reported weight and height from BRFSS are known to
underestimate the true prevalence. However, whether this underestimation is consistent across different demographic groups
has not been fully investigated.
Methods: In this study, we compared the prevalence estimates of obesity (body mass index (BMI) X30 kg/m2) and overweight
(BMI X25 kg/m2) in different demographic groups in the US from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) and BRFSS during 1999­2000. We also compared the rank orders of the obesity and overweight prevalence across
different demographic groups from the two data sources.
Results: Compared to NHANES, BRFSS underestimated the overall prevalence of obesity and overweight by 9.5 and 5.7
percentage points, respectively. The underestimation differed across different demographic groups: the underestimation of
obesity and overweight prevalence was higher among women (13.1 and 12.2 percentage points, respectively) than among men
(5.8 and À0.6 percentage points, respectively). The variation of underestimation was higher among men. A clear inverse
association between educational attainment and obesity prevalence among non-Hispanic African American women was
observed from BRFSS data. However, no such association was found from NHANES. While BRFSS can identify correctly the
population with the highest obesity and overweight burden, it did not accurately rank the obesity and overweight prevalence
across different demographic groups.
Conclusion: Compared to NHANES, BRFSS disproportionately underestimates the prevalence of obesity and overweight across
different gender, race, age, and education subgroups.

Introduction
Obesity has reached an epidemic proportion in the United
States (US) and other developed countries,1,2 with significant
health and economic implications.3,4 It is important to
assess the burden of obesity by various socio-demographic
groups so that effective policies, programs, and interventions
can be better targeted at the high-risk populations. At the
national level, the burden of obesity can be accurately
assessed for various subgroups because large national surveys
(e.g., National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES)) take actual measures of the weight and height
of the respondents. At the state level, however, only self-
reported information on weight and height is available for
adults through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS), and for adolescents and children through
the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System and the Youth
Tobacco Survey. It has been shown that self-reported
weight and height data underestimate the prevalence of

of overweight and obesity prevalence using BRFSS data, and
the consistency of underestimation across different demo-
graphic groups have not been well studied. Such studies
would be useful to evaluate whether BRFSS data can be used
to rank the burden of obesity across different socio-demo-
graphic groups to accurately target interventions.
The objectives of the study are to compare the national
estimates of overweight and obesity prevalence from
HNANES and BRFSS across various socio-demographic
groups, and to evaluate the extent and consistency of
underestimation of overweight and obesity prevalence across
different demographic groups using BRFSS data.
Methods
NHANES 1999­2000
NHANES is a series of cross-sectional, nationally representa-
tive examination surveys conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).8 Beginning in 1999, NHANES became a
continuous survey. The procedures followed to select the
sample and conduct the interviews and examinations were
similar to those for previous surveys. Since 2 or more years
of data are necessary to have adequate sample sizes for
subgroup analyses, this study is based on the first 2 years of
the continuous NHANES data collected during 1999­2000.
NHANES 1999­2000 is a nationally representative cross-
sectional survey of the total civilian non-institutionalized
population in the US. The design was a stratified multistage
probability sample based on selection of counties, blocks,
households, and persons within households. The survey
included a standardized physical examination and house-
hold interview. During physical examination, height and
weight were measured by trained health technicians using
standard procedures. Height was measured with a fixed
stadiometer. Weight was measured in kilograms, with
accuracy to two decimal points, using an electronic-load
cell scale. Adults wore underpants, a disposable paper gown,
paper pants, and foam slippers. No adjustment was made for
clothing weight (approximately 0.1­0.2 kg) in the analysis.
In this study, we included men and women aged 20 years
or older with measured weight and height from NHANES
1999­2000 in the analysis.
BRFSS 1999­2000
BRFSS is a CDC-sponsored, state-based telephone survey of
health risk factors.9 It is a standardized telephone survey
carried out by health agencies in states and the District of
Columbia with assistance from the CDC. The primary
purpose of the BRFSS is to provide state-specific estimates
of the prevalence of behaviors that are associated with the
leading causes of death in the US. Each participating state
independently selects for interview a probability sample
from adult residents aged 18 years or older in households
with telephones. All states in a given year use an identical
core questionnaire administered over the telephone by
trained interviewers. During the telephone interview, re-
spondents were asked, `About how tall are you without
shoes?' and `About how much do you weigh without shoes?'
In this study, we combined the BRFSS 1999 and 2000 data
from all states and territories to generate the national
prevalence of overweight and obesity. We included in the
analysis the data for men and women aged 20 years or older
with self-reported weight and height.
Data analysis
We calculated the body mass index (BMI) as weight (in kg)
divided by the square of height (in m). Overweight is defined
as BMI X25 kg/m2. Obesity is defined as BMI X30 kg/m2.
We performed all statistical analyses using STATA (SE 8.2,
StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), and accounted for the
complex survey designs in our analysis. We excluded from
the analysis pregnant women in both data sources (259 in
NHANES and 3725 in BRFSS). We estimated the prevalence of
overweight and obesity from NHANES 1999­2000 and BRFSS
1999­2000 by race, gender, age (20­39, 40­59, and 60 þ ),
and educational attainment. For analysis involving race,
we only included non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic
blacks. We did not include other racial groups due to their
small sample sizes in the NHANES. However, in estimating
the overall prevalence, we included all racial groups.
We calculated the prevalence differences in obesity and
overweight between the two surveys by subtracting the
prevalence based on BRFSS from that based on NHANES. We
calculated the standard errors for the prevalence differences
[Se(Pn

where Pn

and Se(Pb
) is the standard error of Pb.
Note, in this
formula, that we assumed the covariance between the two
prevalence estimates to be zero, because NHANES and BRFSS
are two independent surveys.
As NHANES was not weighted by education, we standar-
dized the NHANES-based prevalence of overweight and
obesity using the population distribution of educational
levels in the 2000 US Census (less than a high school, high
school graduate or GED, more than a high school). We
assumed that the population distribution of educational
levels among persons aged 20 years or older was the same as
that among those aged 25 years or older in the US in 2000.

BRFSS respondents (including 251 976 non-Hispanic whites
and 24 289 non-Hispanic blacks) were included in this study.
The weighted race, gender, and age distributions in NHANES
1999­2000 and BRFSS 1999­2000 are similar to those in the
2000 US Census. Compared to the 2000 US census data, the
weighted NHANES data were over-represented by persons
with less than a high school education and under-repre-
sented by those with a high school or higher education.
Conversely, the weighted BRFSS data were over-represented
by those with a high school or higher education and under-
represented by those with less than a high school education.
Additionally, compared to the census data, NHANES 1999­
2000 had a lower proportion of persons with a household
income less than $25 000, whereas BRFSS 1999­2000 had a
lower proportion of persons with a household income of
$75 000 or higher (Table 1).11
Obesity and overweight prevalence estimates from NHANES and
BRFSS 1999­2000
The overweight and obesity prevalence estimates from the
two data sources were, in general, different across various
demographic groups. The NHANES­BRFSS differences in the
overall obesity and overweight prevalence were 9.5 and 5.7
percentage points, respectively. The NHANES­BRFSS differ-
ences in obesity and overweight prevalence estimates varied
across gender, race, and age groups: the difference in the
obesity prevalence estimates between NHANES and BRFSS
was highest among non-Hispanic black women (16.7
percentage points), non-Hispanic white men aged 60 or
older (15.4 percentage points), and non-Hispanic white
women (12.5 percentage points); the difference in over-
weight prevalence was highest among non-Hispanic black
men aged 39 or younger (À15.1 percentage points), non-
Hispanic black women (11.6 percentage points), and non-
Hispanic white women (13.4 percentage points) aged 39 or
younger, and non-Hispanic white women aged 60 or older
(12.8 percentage points). The prevalence of overweight
estimated from BRFSS was higher than that from NHANES
among non-Hispanic black and white men aged 20­59
(Table 2).
The NHANES­BRFSS differences in the obesity and over-
weight prevalence estimates varied across different educa-
tion categories: the difference in the obesity prevalence was
more than 20 percentage points among black women with
a high school education and those with more than a high
school education, and no difference among black women
with less than a high school education; the difference in
overweight prevalence was À22.5 percentage points among
non-Hispanic black men with a high school education,
compared to 12.2 percentage points among white women
with more than a high school education (Table 3).
No association between education attainment and obesity
prevalence among African American women was found in
NHANES. However, a clear inverse association between
education and obesity prevalence was observed from BRFSS
data (Table 3). The above findings were not changed after the
age adjustment. Additionally, no association between educa-
tion and overweight prevalence among African American
women was observed in both surveys after adjusting for age.
After standardizing the NHANES-based prevalence by
educational levels, the prevalence of obesity decreased
slightly from 29.9 to 29.5%; similarly, the prevalence of
overweight decreased from 63.6 to 63.3%. Using these
education-standardized prevalence estimates, the NHANES­
BRFSS differences in obesity and overweight prevalence were
9.1 and 5.4 percentage points, respectively.
Rank orders of obesity and overweight prevalence from NHANES
and BRFSS
The rank orders of obesity and overweight prevalence across
different demographic groups varied depending on whether
they were derived from NHANES or BRFSS. In general, the
ranking of obesity and overweight prevalence among
non-Hispanic black men from BRFSS was higher than the
orders from NHANES; the rank orders of obesity prevalence
among non-Hispanic white women was lower than that
from NHANES. However, the demographic groups identified
by NHANES and BRFSS as the subgroups with the highest or
the lowest prevalence of obesity and overweight were the
same: non-Hispanic African American women aged 40 years
or older was the demographic group with the highest

Discussion
Successful implementation of effective interventions to
reduce the obesity burden is a significant challenge for
public health. Currently, obesity-related interventions are
implemented at the state or sub-state level. High-quality data
for monitoring disease burden, tracking trends, and targeting
interventions are crucial for successfully planning, imple-
menting, and evaluating public health interventions, in-
cluding those for obesity prevention.
At the state and sub-state levels, where the interventions
are implemented, currently only self-reported data on
weight and height for adults are available from BRFSS,
based on telephone interviews. BRFSS-type surveys have
been shown to underestimate the true prevalence of over-
weight and obesity.1,5­7 However, whether the underestima-
tion is consistent across different demographic subgroups
has not been fully studied. Jackson et al.5 compared the
prevalence of obesity estimated from a random-digit dialing
telephone interview and a random household examination
survey in the Stanford Five-city Project Survey and found
that the telephone interview underestimated the prevalence
of obesity by 11.2 percentage points. However, whether the
underestimation is consistent across different demographic

Obesity prevalence estimates from NHANES and BRFSS
S Yun et al

data in NHANES III, and found that self-reported data
underestimated the prevalence among adults aged 60 years
or older by 2.1 to 12.8 percentage points, depending on age
and sex. For younger adults, the overweight prevalence
estimates from the two data sources were similar.12 Nelson
et al.13 compared national estimates for height, weight, and
BMI from BRFSS and the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS). Height and weight data in both BRFSS and NHIS
are self-reported. However, BRFSS collects data through
telephone interviews, while NHIS collects data through
household face-to-face interviews. They found that, com-
pared with NHIS, BRFSS tended to underestimate BMI for all
demographic subgroups.13
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to
investigate the extent and consistency of underestimation by
the BRFSS data of overweight and obesity prevalence across
different demographic groups in the US through comparing
the prevalence estimates from BRFSS and NHANES. While
both NHANES and BRFSS strive to collect high-quality
data, potential biases in overweight and obesity prevalence
estimates could arise in both surveys. These biases may
include sampling biases (e.g. sampling frame error), bias due
to non-response, and biases due to measurements. While
NHANES strives for demographic diversity, it was limited in
its geographic diversity to 15 primary sampling units (PSUs)
per year and 30 PSUs over the 2 years of the time frame of
this study.8 There are large variations in obesity prevalence
among states.14 Therefore, NHANES 1999­2000 could have
been over-represented by the sites with higher or lower
obesity prevalence. On the other hand, BRFSS collects data
through telephone interviews. In 2000, the telephone
coverage in the US was approximately 95%, ranged from
87 to 98% across states and among different socio-demo-
graphic groups.15 The sampling frame error could arise from
the variations in telephone coverage.
The actual amount of bias due to nonresponse depends on
two factors ­ the response rate, and the differences between
the responders and the nonresponders. In NHANES 1999­
2000, the overall response rate was 76.3%, compared to
59.0% response rate in BRFSS 1999, and 51.9% in BRFSS
2000.8,15 However, the information on the differences
between responders and nonresponders for both NHANES
and BRFSS is not available for evaluating the potential bias
due to nonresponse.
Weight and height data in NHANES were measured
by trained technicians using standardized equipment
following a standard protocol. Therefore, the potential
biases due to measurements were probably small. In contrast,
BRFSS collected self-reported weight and height data
through telephone interviews. Thus, the biases due to
measurements in BRFSS come from two sources: self-report-
ing and telephone interview. Research has shown that
self-reported weight and height data were inaccurate;16,17,12
in addition, compared to face-to-face interviews, telephone
respondents are more likely to misreport their weight
and height.13
The potential sampling bias and bias due to nonresponse
in the two surveys are reflected by the discrepancies in
the demographic distribution from the two surveys com-
pared with the census data. While both NHANES and
BRFSS were weighted for age, gender, and race to compensate
for unequal probability of selection and nonresponse rate,
the weighted distributions of education and income in
NHANES and BRFSS 1999­2000 were different from each
other, and both surveys differed from the US census data
in different directions. Compared to the 2000 US census
data, the weighted NHANES data were over-represented
by persons with less than a high school education and
under-represented by those with a high school or higher
education. Conversely, the weighted BRFSS data were
over-represented by those with a high school or higher
education and under-represented by those with less than
a high school education. Since persons with higher
education tend to have a lower prevalence of obesity
and overweight, NHANES may have overestimated, and
BRFSS may have underestimated, the overall prevalence
of overweight and obesity due to sampling biases and
nonresponse. However, when we standardized the obesity
and overweight prevalence based on NHANES by education,
the standardized prevalence estimates only slightly
decreased.
Based on the above discussion on the potential biases in
NAHNES and BRFSS, we believe that although NHANES
might slightly overestimate the prevalence overweight
and obesity, the prevalence estimates based on NHANES
are likely to be close to the true prevalence. Therefore, we
used the NHANES as a standard to determine the extent and
consistency of underestimation of the prevalence of over-
weight and obesity of the BRFSS-based estimates across
various socio-demographic groups.
Our study showed that BRFSS did correctly identify the
population with the highest or the lowest obesity and
overweight burden. However, compared to NHANES, BRFSS
substantially underestimated the overall prevalence of
obesity and overweight, and the underestimation differed
across different socio-demographic groups. Also, BRFSS
overestimated the prevalence of overweight among non-
Hispanic black or white men aged 20­59 years. Additionally,
unlike the BRFSS data, the NHANES data did not show
an inverse association between educational attainment and
obesity prevalence among African American women. This
lack of inverse association is consistent with a study by
Mensa et al.18 Therefore, the strong inverse association
between educational level and obesity prevalence among
black women observed in the BRFSS data appears to be
spurious and caused by a significant under-reporting of
the obesity prevalence among black women with a high
school or higher education. These findings raised the
question about the validity of using BRFSS data to evaluate
the obesity burden, and to rank obesity burden across
different demographic groups for targeting obesity-related
interventions.
Obesity prevalence estimates from NHANES and BRFSS

BRFSS data have long been assumed to be adequate for
tracking trends of overweight and obesity because of the
consistency in the methodology. However, this assumption
should be re-examined given the rapid spread of the cellular
phone market and the resulting increase in the proportion of
cell-phone-only households,19 and the fact that cellular
phone numbers have not been included in the BRFSS
sampling frame. As the cell-phone-only households are
probably different from those with hard wire telephones,
the validity of using BRFSS data to track trends needs to be
considered.
Since BRFSS is administered at the state level by health
departments or their subcontractors, the data quality
may vary among states. There may also be variations in
weight and height reporting behaviors in different states.
However, state-specific underestimation of the prevalence of
obesity and overweight cannot be evaluated in this study,
because state-specific estimates cannot be obtained from
NHANES.
Conclusions and recommendations
BRFSS underestimated the overall prevalence of obesity
by 9.5 percentage points, and the overall prevalence of
overweight by 5.7 percentage points, for US adults aged 20
years older during 1999­2000. The degree of underestima-
tion differed in various demographic subgroups. Since at
state or sub-state levels BRFSS data are the only data source
available for evaluating the burden of obesity and for
identifying the population at higher risk in obesity-related
program planning, program planners and evaluation staff
need to be aware of these limitations of the BRFSS data,
especially when comparing racial or socioeconomic sub-
groups. Since obesity-related interventions are priorities for
the states, CDC and states should work together to develop a
methodology to adjust obesity prevalence estimates from
BRFSS data.
