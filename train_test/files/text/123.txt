Research Question

In the aftermath of the global ďŹnancial crisis banking supervisors developed enhanced
approaches to taming the risks of banking system failure. New tools were introduced
to address systemic risk, especially macroprudential capital buďŹers. Stress testing, too,
gained momentum, helping supervisors to gauge the potential impact of adverse devel-
opments. This paper suggests a model â M-PRESS-CreditRisk â that aligns these two
aspects and presents a framework for setting capital requirements that takes systemic
credit risk into accounts.

Contribution

M-PRESS-CreditRisk has two main advantages: First, it provides an advanced portfolio
model for credit risk which captures extreme losses in the banking system that may
materialize during crisis-like, systemic events (tail risk). Second, our framework brings
together for the ďŹrst time diďŹerent prudential instruments that address credit risk either
at the bank level or system level, suggesting a coherent approach to their calibration. For
this purpose, the paper combines the portfolio model with a macroeconomic model which
generates multi-risk-factor, multi-country stress scenarios.

Results and Policy Application

M-PRESS-CreditRisk provides estimates for the banksâ own funds needed to support
credit risk in the banking sector, including forward-looking loan loss provisioning, mini-
mum capital requirements and capital buďŹers that address systemic risk. In particular,
it delivers a measure of systemic credit risk and banksâ individual contributions to it. We
illustrate how the framework works using a sample of 12 systemically important German
banks. The results show that the actual capital levels and the capital needs calculated
with regard to systemic credit risk may diďŹer considerably.

Abstract

M-PRESS-CreditRisk is a new top-down macro stress testing framework that can
help supervisors gauge banksâ capital adequacy related to credit risk. For the ďŹrst
time, it combines calibration of microprudential capital requirements and macro-
prudential buďŹers in a uniďŹed, coherent framework.
Its core element is an ad-
vanced credit portfolio model â SystemicCreditRisk â built upon a rich, non-linear
dependence structure for interconnected bank portfolios. Incorporating numerous
sector/country-speciďŹc systematic factors, the model focuses on credit default con-
centration risk as a major source of large losses that may have systemic impact. A
test run using a sample of 12 systemically important German banks provides mea-
sures for systemic credit risk and the banksâ contributions to it in both baseline and
stress scenarios. Capital requirements calibrated to the results combine elements of
Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, whereas macroprudential buďŹers can internalize the systemâs
tail risk. The maximum model-based combined requirements range between 6.3%
and 27.2% of credit RWA depending on the bank. A comparison with the reported
capital ďŹgures suggests that there appears to be enough capital in the banking sys-
tem, but its distribution might be suboptimal from a systemic point of view as the
capital level of a number of banks might need improvement.

Introduction

In the aftermath of the global ďŹnancial crisis which started in 2007-08 banking supervi-
sors developed enhanced approaches to taming the risks of banking system failure and
introduced with Basel III a macroprudential overlay to bank regulation. The aim of the
traditional microprudential regulation is making sure that individual banks1 can support
their standalone risk; this is achieved with minimum capital requirements. Complemen-
tary to that, the macroprudential overlay targets resilience of the banking sector as a
whole by internalizing the risk of system-wide distress, using a toolkit of capital buďŹers
that address systemic risk.2

Systemic risk is generally deďŹned as the potential loss of economic value or conďŹdence
in a substantial portion of the ďŹnancial system, triggered by a low-probability event
which might have signiďŹcant adverse eďŹects on the real economy (Smaga, 2014; Deutsche
Bundesbank, 2013b; Gerlach, 2009).
It can be described along two dimensions: time
and cross section (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2011; Caruana, 2010). The time dimension of
systemic risk is reďŹected, for instance, in ďŹnancial market actorsâ pro-cyclical behavior
that may exaggerate economic ďŹuctuations. The counter-cyclical capital buďŹer is the
macroprudential tool designed to address these risks (Detken, Weeken, Alessi, BonďŹm,
Boucinha, Castro, Frontczak, Giordana, Giese, Jahn, Kakes, Klaus, Lang, Puzanova, and
Welz, 2014). In the cross section, on the other hand, shocks may become systemic via
many channels of risk propagation such as correlated exposures, balance sheet contagion
through asset devaluation and feedback eďŹects of asset ďŹre sales, direct contagion in an
interbank-network and funding risk due to runs by depositors and short-term wholesale
lenders (Cont and Schaanning, 2016; Clerc, Giovannini, LangďŹeld, Peltonen, Portes, and
Scheicher, 2016; Gorton and Metrik, 2012). Macroprudential tools available in the EU
that address structural, non-cyclical systemic risks include the systemic risk buďŹer and
the buďŹer for other systemically important institutions (O-SII).3

Despite considerable headway already made, the question about a speciďŹc level of
capital that banks should have to suďŹciently cover systemic risk remains a subject of
scientiďŹc debate.4 Thus, not least for pragmatic reasons, supervisory macro stress testing
became widely used as a tool for capital needs assessment under adverse macroeconomic
scenarios. The supervisory stress tests can generally be conducted for micro- and macro-
prudential purposes. For microprudential purposes, a set of scenarios is given to banks.
The banks use these scenarios for their institute-speciďŹc calculations accomplished along
strict methodological guidance and provide the supervisor with the results. In the EU,

3Articles 133 and 131(5) of the CRD IV, respectively. The latter represents the Unionâs implementation
of the Basel framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks (BCBS, 2012). SIIs are
large and complex organizations whose failure might create major disruptions in the functioning of the
ďŹnancial system (see also Freixas and Rochet, 2013).

4A number of academics voice doubts about whether the Basel III reforms go far enough. Hellwig
(2013) and Admati and Hellwig (2013) recommend that banks have equity in the range of 20% to 30%
of their total assets. Furthermore, Admati, DeMarzo, Hellwig, and PďŹeiderer (2013) argue that setting
capital requirements substantially above the currently existing levels bears more social beneďŹts than
social costs. Dagher, DellâAriccia, Laeven, Ratnovski, and Tong (2016) estimate capital rates suďŹcient
to have withstood past banking crisis in a range between 15% and 23% of risk-weighted assets (RWA),
depending on the assumptions.

the European Banking Authority (EBA) has carried out these so called bottom-up stress
tests since 2011 (EBA, 2016). The goal of such exercises is to primarily estimate capital
needs for single institutions.

For macroprudential purposes supervisors often develop their own models in order to
run so called top-down stress tests in a uniďŹed manner, i.e. independently of any possible
divergence in the banksâ internal models. For instance, the ECB, BoE, OeNB, and the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) have developed comprehensive
stress testing frameworks.5 Common to these frameworks is initially that they incorporate
ďŹrst-round eďŹects of macroeconomic shocks on the capital adequacy of individual banks.
Additionally, they incorporate second-round eďŹects such as contagion in the interbank
network and asset ďŹre sales, feedback eďŹects to the real economy, liquidity or funding risk,
which is important from the macroprudential perspective. Therefore, macroprudential
stress tests go beyond capital adequacy assessment from the point of view of an individual
institution; their primary goal and the value added is to take into account the externalities
of systemic risk to be able to judge about capital adequacy for the whole banking system.
The latter is also the angle of the growing strand of literature on top-down supervisory
macroprudential stress testing where our paper steps in. We argue, that large credit losses
represent a major risk for a banking system. Hence, modeling portfolio credit risk should
be a key component of every stress testing framework. However, for reasons of simplicity,
some approaches do not capture the non-linear character of portfolio credit risk in a
proper way nor do they incorporate an externality important from the macroprudential
point of view, namely the risk related to rare, extreme credit losses in the banking system,
usually referred to as tail risk. For instance, both the BoEâs and the ECBâs stress testing
frameworks as well as stress tests regularly conducted by the FRB focus on expected losses
under the macroeconomic stress scenarios but do not account for unexpected losses which
are the main source of risk (Dees, Henry, and Martin, 2017; FRB, 2016; Hirtle and Lehnert,
2014; Henry and Kok, 2013; Burrows, Learmonth, and McKeown, 2012; Alessandri, Gai,
Kapadia, Mora, and Puhr, 2009). Other authors â Busch, Koziol, and Mitrovic (2015)
and DÂ¨ullmann and Kick (2014) â go further and adopt a Merton-type portfolio model for
solvency stress testing. Yet, such models only account for linear correlation between the
systematic risk factors and are not designed to properly address the tail risk externality.
The closest to our model is Systemic Risk Monitor (SRM) of the OeNB (Boss, Krenn,
Puhr, and Summer, 2006; Elsinger, Lehar, and Summer, 2006a). Pointing to the minor
importance of the linearized losses for assessing credit risk, SRM instead applies the
CreditRisk+ model6 in order to obtain entire loan loss probability distributions. Using a
latent common economic shock, SRM introduces correlation between the banksâ portfolios,
which provides a clue as to how a macroprudential approach to credit risk assessment in
a banking system may proceed.

At this juncture, our paper aims at improving the macroprudential supervisory stress
testing toolkit for modeling the ďŹrst-round eďŹects due to the credit risk. We concen-

trate on the channel of correlated credit exposures and develop a new, advanced port-
folio model: SystemicCreditRisk. To make it operational for supervisory needs, we em-
bed the portfolio model into a top-down macro stress testing framework abbreviated as
M-PRESS-CreditRisk, which refers to micro- and macroprudential requirements under
systemic stress with focus on credit risk.

We consider SystemicCreditRisk to be the major contribution of our paper. We tailor
this stochastic portfolio model to the supervisory needs of assessing the risk of potentially
extreme system-wide credit losses (tail risk). Originating from correlated credit expo-
sures, tail risk may materialize in an adverse, crisis-like macroeconomic scenario. This
is captured by modeling systematic risk that simultaneously aďŹects borrower probabili-
ties of default (PDs) in a given industry sector and/or country. Additionally, borrowers
from diďŹerent sectors and countries are interconnected using a rich and heterogeneous
dependence structure for the systematic part of credit risk that allows for non-linear de-
pendence. Importantly, this structure links the banksâ portfolios together and, in eďŹect,
accounts for default concentration risk â a major source of potentially large losses in a
banking system.

This allows us to go beyond a microprudential analysis for individual banks, also as-
sessing risks from the systemic perspective. Thus, our second contribution consists in
developing a holistic micro- and macroprudential approach to capital adequacy assess-
ment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ďŹrst paper that brings together both
aspects of prudential capital regulation: making sure that individual banks can support
their standalone risk and making the banking sector as a whole more resilient by inter-
nalizing the risk of system-wide distress. To accomplish this task, we suggest a coherent
approach to inform the calibration of the respective capital instruments, including the
systemic risk buďŹer and the O-SII buďŹer.

Our stress testing framework M-PRESS-CreditRisk combines an advanced portfolio
model with other modules that generate and translate macroeconomic scenarios into bor-
rower PDs and provide output that may serve policy purposes, as shown in Figure 1.1.

The ďŹrst building block generates relevant international macroeconomic stress sce-
narios that could aďŹect banksâ multinational credit exposure. For the purpose of this
paper we apply NiGEM as a scenario-generating engine.7 The second building block rep-
resents a satellite macro-econometric model that links these scenarios with a measure
of the credit quality of bank portfolios represented by the ratio of non-performing loans
(NPLs). In a ďŹrst step, we estimate the country-level relationship between macroeconomic
variables also obtained from NiGEM and the NPL rates obtained mostly from the Inter-
national Monetary Fund (IMF) database. In a second step, we apply this relationship in
order to translate the macroeconomic scenarios into the future NPL ratio projections.

The stochastic portfolio model SystemicCreditRisk is the third and central
building block of our framework. It develops and estimates the joint probability distribu-
tion (based on a âheavy-tailedâ copula) for the systematic part of credit risk common to
diďŹerent sectors and/or countries. This distribution is constrained to a âstressedâ region
due to a link to the NPL ratio projections under the stress scenarios, which results in
stressed borrower PDs. Using granular information about the banksâ credit exposures,
this block simulates probability distributions of portfolio losses for each individual bank

7NiGEM is frequently used in central banks, but any other model that can deliver international

macroeconomic stress scenarios can be utilized here.

and the entire system. The resulting portfolio loss distributions deliver all relevant credit
risk metrics, including measures of systemic credit risk and the banks contributions to it.
The fourth and last building block â policy applications â develops a novel coherent
approach to capital adequacy assessment. In more detail, it shows how both micropruden-
tial capital requirements of Pillar 1 and 2 and macroprudential buďŹers can be calibrated
to the respective risk metrics derived from the simulated portfolio loss distributions.

To test the new framework, we carry out an analysis for 12 systemically important
German banks, using unique supervisory data of the German credit register as of 2013Q4.
In this illustrative study we concentrate on macroeconomic shocks to Greece, Italy, Portu-
gal and Spain (GIPS) and, additionally, include a scenario that generates macroeconomic
stress at the global level. We observe heterogenous results: The maximum model-based
combined capital requirements range between 6.3% and 27.2% of credit RWA depending
on the bank. On aggregate, it appears to be enough capital in the system to support the
systemâs tail risk, and a number of individual banks seem to be very well capitalized in
accordance with the model. However, the other banksâ capital level seems to need im-
provement. These ďŹndings suggest that the distribution of capital in the system might be
suboptimal from the macroprudential point of view (i.e. when the banksâ contributions to
the system-wide credit risk are taken into account). Moreover, our results and conclusions
based on them are robust to econometric approaches and estimation techniques (satellite

Needless to say, our numerical results should be treated cautiously. First, while the
results of each model are subject to uncertainty, the linkage of the models may elevate
the overall degree of uncertainty (see Danielsson, James, Valenzuela, and Zer, 2016). Sec-
ond, our present assessment concentrates on the credit risk that arises from correlated
exposures, not yet taking into account the systemic risk propagation via direct contagion
and other channels mentioned above. Third, the microprudential capital requirements
obtained in our framework and the regulatory requirements based on the banksâ inter-
nal models are not directly comparable because of many diďŹerences in the underlying
assumptions.8

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our novel portfolio model.
Section 3 describes the data sets used. Section 4 presents our stress test scenarios. Sec-
tion 5 designs the satellite macro-econometric model and discusses estimation results.
Section 6 focuses on the calibration of SystemicCreditRisk, the sampling procedure, and
the relevant risk metrics. Section 7 makes suggestions for calibration of capital tools.
Section 8 concludes with a summary.

2 SystemicCreditRisk

2.1 Basic set-up of the portfolio model

SystemicCreditRisk joins the ranks of default-only type of credit portfolio models, i.e. it
only considers a borrowerâs default as a credit event.9 The target variable is the credit
portfolio loss (PL). This is deďŹned as the sum of losses on exposures to N individual
borrowers that comprise the portfolio and is calculated as

(cid:88)N

i=1

P L =

EADi Âˇ LGDi Âˇ Di.

(2.1)

EAD represents the credit exposure at the moment of a borrower iâs default (i.e. exposure
at default). LGD or loss given default is the percentage of the EAD that will be potentially
lost in the event of the borrowerâs default. D denotes the default indicator that equals
one if the borrower defaults and zero otherwise. D is a random, Bernoulli-distributed
variable. Its distribution is governed by one parameter set to the borrowerâs probability

8The Basel II formula for minimum capital requirements under the IRB approach is based on the
assumption of a perfectly diversiďŹed credit portfolio and, thus, neglects credit concentration risk. This
approach only accounts for one source of systematic risk in the portfolio and does not allow default
correlations to be stronger in the downswing (tail dependence). Our model relaxes those assumptions
and, therefore, leads to a more conservative estimation of portfolio credit risk (see Puzanova, 2011).
Additionally to the microprudential layer of requirements, our model accounts for correlation between
bank portfolios and for the banksâ impact on the system-wide risk, which is not part of the stand-
alone assessment of the individual banksâ risk under Basel II. We also assess credit risk in adverse
macroeconomic scenarios and, based on that, calibrate macroprudential capital buďŹers, which were not
part of the oďŹcial capital requirements at the time of consideration.

of default (PD). All variables mentioned refer, as is usual in this type of model, to a risk
horizon of one year into the future.

When we consider the credit portfolio of an individual bank, the sum in Equation (2.1)
runs over all borrowers of this bank. For the systemâs portfolio, on the other hand, the
sum is taken over the borrowers of all banks contained in the sample. If a ďŹrm i borrows
from diďŹerent banks, Di is the same for all these banks, but EADi and LGDi represent
bank-speciďŹc ďŹgures.

D is the only random variable in Equation (2.1); EADs, LGDs and PDs are treated
as ďŹxed values (calibrated in Section 6.1). Since Di are stochastic, so is PL. Thus, PL
has a probability distribution. This is determined by the joint probability distribution of
{Di}i=1,...,N . Therefore, in order to approximate the probability distribution of PL using
Monte Carlo sampling, we need to make assumptions about the stochastic structure that
governs mutual dependencies among the default indicators. In this respect, there are es-
sentially two approaches. One method ties default indicators to the underlying economic
factors that may lead to borrowers default, such as the obligorsâ asset value (structural
models). The other method speciďŹes the dependence structure of default indicators di-
rectly, not going into details on the economic reasons behind a default, such as negative
equity when the asset value drops below the value of the borrowerâs debt (reduced-form
models). In this paper, we exploit the second method. For more information on the two
approaches, we recommend DuďŹe and Singleton (2003) and Gordy (2000).

2.2 Hierarchical dependence structure

Building SystemicCreditRisk we adopt the central assumption of CreditRisk+ (CSFB,
1997) which is that PDs are realizations of random variables dependent on systematic
background factors.10 Following this general idea, we assume that the variability of PDs
over time relates to a number of stochastic systematic factors that reďŹect business cycle
eďŹects. âBadâ realizations of the systematic factors increase default rates in the economy
and, therefore, cause larger losses for banks (recessions). âGoodâ realizations decrease
default rates (upswings). This is consistent with the hypothesis that joint default risk
varies with economic conditions, as investigated empirically by Das, Freed, Geng, and
Kapadia (2006) among others.

We introduce one systematic factor for each group of borrowers, as described below.
This factor applies multiplicatively to the borrowersâ PDs and scales them up and down.
More formally, the stochastic probability of default of a borrower n in group m is a
function of the ďŹxed PD as estimated by the lender and the group-speciďŹc stochastic
systematic factor Sm.11 This is given as

P Dmi(Sm) = P Dmi Âˇ Sm, with E[Sm] = 1, m = 1, . . . , M.

(2.2)

10This assumption arises from the observed variability of actual default rate statistics over time. Con-
sider, for instance, insolvency statistics by sector published by the German Federal Statistical OďŹce
(a proxy for the rate of borrowersâ defaults): Whereas mean historical insolvency rates over the period
1995â2012 ranged in a sectoral cross section from 0.2 % for electricity, gas and water supply companies
to 2.5 % for ďŹnancial intermediaries and insurance companies, their standard deviation over this time
period ranged between 0.1 % and 1.2 %, respectively.

11The implicit assumption here is that the lender estimates PDs in a through-the-cycle manner (as
opposed to a point-in-time estimate which incorporates information on the current state of the economy).

6

A common systematic factor Sm refers to systematic risk that aďŹects all borrowers in
group m. This is normalized to have unity expectation so that E[P Dmi(Sm)] = P Dmi
holds. That is, on average, the random PDs equal their estimates reported by lenders. In
terms of default correlation, Equation (2.2) generally implies

corr(cid:0)Dmi, Dnj

(cid:1) =

(cid:112)P Dmi(1 â P Dmi)(cid:112)P Dnj(1 â P Dnj)

P DmiP Dnj

Âˇ cov(Sm, Sn)

for two borrowers in diďŹerent groups m and n. For two borrowers in the same group m,
var(Sm) replaces cov(Sm, Sn). That is, the (co-)variation of systematic factors governs
linear dependence among the borrowersâ defaults.

Introducing systematic factors has an important consequence from a systemic per-
spective. It makes the default indicators of the obligors of diďŹerent banks dependent on
common factors and, thus, renders the banksâ portfolios interdependent. Therefore, the
model captures defaults concentration risk as a major source of potentially large losses in
the banking sector.12

As in the CreditRisk+ model, random variables Sm follow a gamma distribution with
expectation one and variance given by the scale parameter Îąm, as recapitulated in Ap-
pendix A.1. In the standard CreditRisk+ setting, though, the group-speciďŹc factors Sm
are assumed to be mutually independent, which implies that default events of the bor-
rowers who belong to diďŹerent sectors/countries are independent of each other. Such a
simplifying assumption might lead to a signiďŹcant underestimation of losses given that
in Germany, for instance, the correlation between insolvency rates in diďŹerent industries
often reaches 60% to 90%.13 A more realistic model would allow for inter-group depen-
dence. Giese (2004) introduces two such models â hidden gamma and compound gamma14
â which generate a uniform inter-group correlation and a uniform inter-group covariance,
respectively. In both models the maximum possible correlation depends on either largest
or smallest sector variance. Parameters involved can, in principle, be ďŹtted to an exter-
nally given covariance matrix of risk factors. However, a good ďŹt is rarely possible and
the ďŹtting procedure is far from being straightforward, since M + 1 parameters of the
systematic factors have to be ďŹtted to an empirical covariance matrix with M (M + 1)/2
degrees of freedom (see also Glogova and Warnung, 2006, pp. 80-81).

For SystemicCreditRisk we design a novel, conceptually appealing model for the inter-
group dependence. Its parameters can be estimated without constraints using conven-
tional statistical techniques and historical data from the German credit register. We

12As the global ďŹnancial crisis demonstrated, contagion between diďŹerent parts of the market can be
another source of systemic risk, especially due to loss of conďŹdence (see Allen and Carletti, 2013, p.
125). However, at this stage of the model development we do not consider contagious eďŹects via direct
linkages between the banks. We instead give priority to an advanced portfolio model. The impact of
systematic factors on common exposure of banks does indeed have far more severe consequences for the
probability of simulations bank defaults than direct contagion through the interbank market, as pointed
out in Elsinger et al. (2006a, p. 1311) and Elsinger, Lehar, and Summer (2006b, p. 154) and references
therein.

13Correlation was estimated for the insolvency statistics published by the German Federal Statistical
OďŹce (see Footnote 10) in a simpliďŹed manner without adjusting for the autocorrelation. Similar ďŹndings
for Germany for the period 1962â1993 are reported by Lesko, Schlottmann, and Vorgrimler (2004).

suggest joining the group-speciďŹc factors by a copula function.15 Using copulas has the
advantage that we can control dependence characteristics by choosing a copula with ap-
propriate properties such as

1. A heterogeneous dependence structure.

2. Upper tail dependence.

3. Feasible parameter estimation and sampling in high-dimensional problems.

The ďŹrst property allows diďŹerentiating between groups that are closely related to each
other and groups that are only weakly related to each other. The second characteristic
means that large, i.e. âbadâ, realizations of diďŹerent systematic factors are likely to oc-
cur simultaneously. Consequently, default probabilities of the borrowers tend to increase
simultaneously, mimicking clustering default events during a recession, when credit con-
centration risk materializes in large losses. The third, pragmatic criterion implies that
even for a large number of systematic factors, estimation and sampling from the copula
have to remain feasible.

Archimedean copulas with their simple, closed-form analytical representation are typ-
ical candidates for modeling high-dimensional joint distributions (our third criterion).
Whereas these copulas themselves are not suitable for modeling heterogeneous depen-
dence structures (our ďŹrst criterion), the nested or hierarchical Archimedean copulas
(HACs) fulďŹll this requirement.16 It is possible to construct a HAC consistent with the
second criterium, using a Gumbel generating function.
A Gumbel copula has one parameter Î¸ â [1,â) that controls the strength of depen-
dence between random variables, including the asymptotical upper tail dependence (see
deďŹnition A.2). This parameter is closely related to Kendallâs rank correlation Ď given
in deďŹnition A.1.17 For a bivariate Gumbel copula (a copula that joints two random
variables), Ď has a simple analytical expression in terms of the dependence parameter:
Ď = (Î¸ â 1)/Î¸. This shows that higher values of Î¸ lead to stronger dependence of the
marginal distributions. Î¸ = 1 corresponds to the independence copula.

The dependence model that we suggest has a hierarchical structure. Its ďŹrst hierarchy
level comprises single sectors, countries and regions, i.e. one-dimensional marginal distri-
butions of the systematic factors. At the next level, some of the sectors, countries and
regions are coupled together, for instance, two or three at a time. They a combined by
low-dimensional marginal Gumbel copulas with large dependence parameters. Some of
the sectors, countries and regions remain loose at this level. They may join in at the next,
higher level of hierarchy, where marginal copulas with smaller dependence parameters
may combine them either with each other or with the copulas of their peers that have
been already coupled together at the previous level. And so on until, at the very top,
the last remaining elements are joined together by a copula with the smallest dependence
parameter (possibly equal to 1). The entire structure has a mathematical representation

15Appendix A.2 provides the basic theoretical background for copulas. For further reading, we recom-

mend Aas (2004) and Okhrin, Okhrin, and Schmid (2013).

16For an application of HAC within a structural credit risk framework and for its impact on the portfolio

tail risk in comparison to a Gaussian model see Puzanova (2011).

17Conceptually, a measure of rank correlation is more appealing than the Pearsonâs linear correlation

in the non-Gaussian context: see Appendix A.2.

that can be easily pieced together using expressions in the form of Equation (A.7) in
Appendix A.2.

The assumptions of gamma marginal distributions and a dependence function in the
form of HAC with a Gumbel generator completely determine the joint distribution func-
tion of the systematic factors. Relevant parameters must be ďŹtted to the available data,
as Section 6.2 will describe.

2.3 Portfolio loss distribution and risk metrics

Having completed the description of our portfolio model, we now outline the general
procedure for sampling portfolio loss variable which delivers PL distributions at the bank
and system level:

1. Draw 1, 000 joint realizations of M systematic factors using their copula.

2. Based on that, obtain conditional PDs as given in Equation (2.2).

3. For each joint realization of the systematic factors, draw 10, 000 realizations of the

individual default indicators for each single borrower using the conditional PDs.

4. For each draw, calculate portfolio loss according to Equation (2.1).

5. Calculate the empirical probability distribution of PLs for each single bank and for
the entire system; the systemâs loss equals the sum of losses of all banks in a given
simulation run.

The overall number of simulation runs amounts to ten million â a solid basis for the
empirical PL distributions.

To express credit risk in numbers, we can obtain the following metrics from the PL
distributions of every single bank and of the entire system: expected loss, value-at-risk
and expected shortfall. Furthermore, from the simulation results we can also derive each
bankâs contribution to the systemâs expected shortfall. In the following paragraph, we
deďŹne these risk metrics in plain words and refer to Puzanova and DÂ¨ullmann (2013, p.
1245 f.) and references therein for more technical details:

â˘ Expected loss (EL) is deďŹned as the expected value of PL. It is estimated as the

mean of the simulated PL distribution.

â˘ Value-at-risk (VaR) equals a predeďŹned percentile q of the PL distribution. VaR
is estimated as the level of PL that was only exceeded in (100 â q)% of simulation
runs.

â˘ Expected shortfall (ES) is deďŹned as the expected value of PL beyond the VaR. We

calculate the ES as the mean over (100 â q)% of the largest realizations of PL.18

â˘ A bankâs individual contribution to the systemâs ES is estimated as the mean PL of
the bank in those (100 â q)% of simulation runs, in which the systemâs PL exceeds
the VaR-threshold.

18For simplicity, we do not adjust ES for the discontinuity of the discrete probability distribution of

losses; see Puzanova and DÂ¨ullmann (2013, p. 1245).

3 Data

To study the impact of macroeconomic stress scenarios on the credit portfolios of system-
ically important German banks, we combine four data sets: (1) macroeconomic variables,
(2) NPL ratios, (3) the Bundesbankâs credit register and (4) supervisory reporting data.
We generate the relevant international macroeconomic stress scenarios using NiGEM.
From the NiGEM database, we additionally obtain time series of macroeconomic vari-
ables and use them for the empirical estimation of the satellite macro-econometric model.
Working with the same database ensures consistency of estimation, projection and stress
testing.

The country-speciďŹc NPL ratios are largely obtained from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) database on Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI). In the IMF FSI database
NPLs are deďŹned as non-performing loans to total gross loans.19 This data is enriched with
NPL ratio time series from the World Bank and, in some cases, from the National Central
Banks. We use quarterly rather than annual observations, which allows for NPL ratio
projections that may vary during the year. The recent crisis, in particular, demonstrated
how quickly events in ďŹnancial markets can be reďŹected in changes of NPL ratios.

The Bundesbankâs credit register is our main data source for individual exposures
of German banks to their borrowers.20 Therefore, we build our portfolio model on this
database. The credit register contains information on large exposures that reached or
exceed e1.5 million anytime during the reporting period. We concentrate on the 12 ma-
jor banks that, at the time of our analysis, the German Federal Financial Supervisory
Authority (BaFin) identiďŹed (along with a few other banks) as systemically important in-
stitutions.21 Nevertheless, no aggregation at group level takes place. We instead consider
individual credit exposures of all banks belonging to a group, omitting the intra-group
claims. For each borrower, the credit register contains information on the country code
and industry branch. The credit register thus covers both domestic and foreign exposures
of individual banks to other banks, other ďŹnancial institutions, non-ďŹnancial ďŹrms, house-

19However, there is no single deďŹnition of NPLs across countries. For a detailed discussion of the
deďŹnition of NPLs according the IMF FSI database, see also Beck, Jakubik, and Piloiu (2013). The
IMF summarizes the recommendations for considering loans (and other assets) as NPLs in the IFS
Compilation Guide. According to the Guide, loans (and other assets) become non-performing when (1)
payments of interest and/or principal are more than 90 days past due, or (2) interest payments equal to
90 days or more have been capitalized, reďŹnanced, or delayed by agreement, or payments are less than
90 days overdue, but there are doubts that payments will be made in full (IMF, 2006). The Basel II
rules and to the EBA standards introduced in 2013 use a broader deďŹnition of non-performing exposures
that applies to all on-balance sheet loans and debt securities (except those held for trading) as well as to
some oďŹ-balance sheet exposures. Additionally, non-performing exposures include defaulted and impaired
exposures, or exposures more than 90 days past due, or, if the full repayment of principal and interest
without realization of collateral is unlikely, regardless of the number of days past due (BIS, 2016; EBA,
2013).

20Details on the credit register can be found in Schmieder (2006), and in published work by Ongena,
TÂ¨umer-Alkan, and von Westernhagen (2015, 2012); Bednarek, Dinger, and von Westernhagen (2015), for
example. Additional documents on the credit register provides tab âTasks â Banking supervision â
Lending businessâ at www.bundesbank.de/en/.

21The list of systemically important German institutions may change every year. BaFin pub-
lishes an updated list at https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Eigenmittel_BA/dl_
asri_institute_ba.pdf. See also the list published by the EBA at http://www.eba.europa.eu/

holds and governments. We consider them all, excluding only loans to the central banks.
Furthermore, we obtain information on borrowersâ PDs as estimated from internal rating
systems by the lenders and information about the credit risk mitigation techniques such
as collateral and guarantees.

Finally, we obtain data on capital and RWA for the banks under consideration from the
supervisory reporting system maintained by the Bundesbank and the BaFin for regular
banking supervision. All bank-speciďŹc information is as of 2013Q4.

Below we present some descriptive statistics on large German banks and brieďŹy elab-
orate on their credit exposure to the GIPS countries, on which our application example
focuses. Section 6 devoted to the calibration of the portfolio model will present more
details on the country- and sector-breakdown.

The 12 systemically important German banks we focus on in our analysis cover 60%
from total assets of the whole banking industry as of 2013Q4; see Table A.1. Their
exposure and RWA reported in the credit register total e2,309 billion and to e641 billion,
respectively. Thus, the data from the credit register accounts for about 78% of the banksâ
total RWA for credit risk, which equals e817 billion. On average, they maintain core
equity tier 1 capital (CET1) ratio of nearly 16%.

Table A.2 additionally provides aggregated ďŹgures on the banksâ portfolio structure
with respect to the GIPS countries. Whereas the overall foreign exposure accounts for
55% (e1,272 billion) of the total exposure, exposure to the borrowers located in the GIPS
countries makes up 12% (e147 billion). In this context, Italy (e76 billion) and Spain
(e58 billion) account for a bulk of the GIPS exposure. Exposure to Portugal and Greece
is far less signiďŹcant (e10 billion and e2 billion, respectively).

4 Scenario Design

4.1 Modeling with NiGEM

The present paper designs relevant international macroeconomic stress scenarios using
NiGEM. NiGEM is a global structural macroeconomic model developed and maintained
by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). It is often used for
policy analysis and stress testing purposes by various institutions, such as international
organizations and central banks (including the ECB; Dees et al., 2017). It combines struc-
tural models for a large number of individual economies by linking them through trade,
prices and ďŹnancial markets. Thus, the model captures important mechanisms for the
transmission of macroeconomic shocks across countries.22 Additionally, we use the base-
line scenario designed by the NIESR that supplies projections as to how macroeconomic
variables could develop in the future in the absence of any additional shocks.

22In contrast to purely empirical models (e.g. vector autoregressive or VAR models) NiGEM im-
poses an explicit structure on economies and exhibits âNew Keynesianâ characteristics by combining
nominal rigidities and forward-looking elements. On the other hand, it does not model the microeco-
nomic optimization decisions which are the foundation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
models. For an overview of NiGEM, see, in particular, Barrell, Becker, Byrne, Gottschalk, Hurst, and
van Welsum (2004). A brief model description and a policy application are also provided by Catte,
Cova, Pagano, and Visco (2011), for example. For more recent information on the model structure, see
http://nimodel.niesr.ac.uk/.

11

We deďŹne various stress scenarios using shocks to certain variables that induce en-
dogenous reactions of real GDP, unemployment as well as short and long-term interest
rates. One key advantage of this model-based approach is that the derived responses of
the variables which are relevant to bank stress are model-consistent and not determined
exogenously. The short-term (three-month) interest rates, in particular, develop in ac-
cordance with NiGEMâs default monetary policy rules, the key objective of which is to
stabilize inďŹation. The long-term interest rates are, in turn, derived from the expected
short-term interest rates over the next ten years. The deviations of the relevant variables
from the baseline (as a percentage or percentage points) show the extent of macroeco-
nomic stress generated. The levels for important macroeconomic variables represent the
sum of the baseline levels and the deviations in a stress scenario simulation. Thus, they
also depend on the underlying NIESR projections. In macroeconomic stress tests, suďŹ-
ciently strong stress should be generated within a plausible macroeconomic setting. The
scenarios presented in this paper which focus on speciďŹc, intuitive macroeconomic stories
have been designed in order to illustrate how our model works. The consideration of even
larger individual shocks might have compromised the plausibility of the scenarios. How-
ever, it would be straightforward to combine the individual scenarios in order to generate
even greater macroeconomic stress (at the expense of an intuitive storytelling).

In all stress scenarios, GDP declines and the unemployment rate increases in the GIPS
countries compared to the baseline. However, the implications for the interest rate spread,
i.e. the premium on long over short-term interest rates, diďŹer considerably depending on
the speciďŹc stress scenario applied. As a rule, the shocks for the GIPS countries are
calibrated to the same relative magnitude (e.g. as a percentage of GDP). Furthermore,
the shocks always hit these countries simultaneously, which means that direct eďŹects and
spill-over are included in the simulations. Originating in a small number of countries,
the shocks are transmitted to macroeconomic variables in other countries in the NiGEM
world.
In all cases, the simulations of stress scenarios start in 2015Q1 and allow us
to make a projection over a four-year time horizon until 2018Q4, based on the baseline
scenario assumed in NiGEM.23 The baseline starts as early as 2014Q1. In order to generate
suďŹciently strong stress, each scenario represents a combination of several macroeconomic
shocks. Subsequent shocks are implemented by stacked simulations so that new shocks
are not anticipated by economic agents.

4.2 Macro stress scenarios for the GIPS countries

We concentrate on macroeconomic shocks to the GIPS countries. During the sovereign
debt crisis in the euro area the GIPS countries were subject to severe macroeconomic
stress, which also aďŹected other economies adversely. While we acknowledge that the
past may not be a good guide to the future, we have selected those countries in order to
illustrate how stress propagated through our model might potentially aďŹect the German
ďŹnancial sector. Additionally, we include a scenario that generates macroeconomic stress
at the global level. Overall, we simulate three stress scenarios for the GIPS countries
in NiGEM: an oil crisis, a ďŹnancial crisis and a scenario of ďŹscal contraction. They are
mutually complementary insofar as they diďŹer particularly in terms of the development of
the interest rate spread. Moreover, the scenarios also diďŹer in terms of the persistence of

23NiGEM version v2.14-b and the corresponding baseline APR14-B were used for simulation purposes.

12

the assumed shocks and the degree to which other economies are aďŹected by the assumed
shocks. Figure A.1 presents the resulting deviations of the macroeconomic variables of
interest from their baseline path for the GIPS countries.

Oil crisis scenario.

In the oil crisis scenario, an exogenous surge in the nominal
oil price is assumed, which might reďŹect an escalation of geopolitical tensions, for exam-
ple.24 Eventually, the oil price peaks at US$120 above the baseline, before returning to
the baseline. This oil price shock raises inďŹation sharply at the global level, triggering
a vigorous tightening in monetary policies so that short-term interest rates rise steeply
relative to long-term rates. Real global output falls below the baseline due to the imme-
diate weakness in aggregate demand and the deterioration in supply-side fundamentals.
As the oil price surge ultimately proves to be transitory, however, the variables return to
their original path in the long term.

Financial crisis scenario. In this scenario, a crisis in the ďŹnancial markets of the
GIPS countries is generated by a combination of several shocks which, eventually turn
out to be temporary. First, a term premium is used to raise the long-term interest rates
relative to short-term interest rates. This corresponds ceteris paribus to a decline in the
prices of the aďŹected government bonds. As the yields on government bonds form the basis
of enterprisesâ ďŹnancing costs, this dampens private investment. Additionally, a premium
is also introduced directly into enterprisesâ user costs of capital with the aim of capturing a
speciďŹc deterioration in their ďŹnancing conditions. The overall rise in user costs of capital
in the GIPS countries resembles the crisis in 2008-09. At the same time, a slump in stock
prices is simulated via the risk premium contained in stock prices, while house prices are
lowered exogenously. Overall, a pronounced weakness in aggregate demand (especially in
private investment) is generated in the GIPS countries which dampens consumer prices
there over the longer term. However, the ďŹnancial shocks entail a depreciation of the
euro, the short-term inďŹationary impact of which aďŹects the entire euro area and needs
to be dampened from the perspective of monetary policy. As a result, the euro area-
wide short-term interest rate rises slightly above the baseline initially before it falls below
it. A decline in real (long-term) interest rates stimulates investment in other euro-area
countries counteracting a shortfall in demand due to reduced exports to GIPS countries.
Lower euro-area demand and the depreciation of the euro also transmit the impact of the
shocks to economies outside the euro area.

Fiscal contraction scenario. The scenario of ďŹscal contraction simulates ambi-
tious eďŹorts to improve public ďŹnances in the GIPS countries combining cuts to (real)
government consumption and hikes in the income tax rate. To capture mixed economic
developments in the euro area, nominal hourly wages in Germany are raised exogenously
above the baseline. At the euro-area aggregate level, this basic inďŹationary shock coun-
teracts the disinďŹationary impact of ďŹscal consolidation in the GIPS countries. As a
result, there is virtually no change in short-term and long-term interest rates in the euro
area. Nevertheless, real aggregate output in the GIPS countries is severely dampened in
this setting. In Germany, real GDP is somewhat lower compared to the baseline, as the
exogenous rise in wages constitutes a negative supply-side shock.25

24The plunge in the oil price since mid-2014 demonstrates that the oil market has been prone to severe
price shifts. Moreover, US recessions have been regularly preceded by strong increases in the oil price;
(see Hamilton, 2011).

5 Multi-Country Macro-Econometric Model

5.1 Dynamic country panel model

Designing our satellite macro-econometric model, we follow the current literature on the
determinants of NPLs (Beck et al., 2013; Louzis, Vouldis, and Metaxas, 2012) and use
the dynamic panel approach in order to estimate the impact of macroeconomic variables
on the NPL ratios. The estimation procedure examines changes in the NPL ratios rather
than NPL ratio levels.26

The regression explains changes in the NPL ratios at country level in terms of changes
in the most important macroeconomic variables that may theoretically exert an inďŹuence
on the NPLs. The explanatory variables taken into consideration relate, ďŹrst, to the real
economy (the growth rate of real GDP and the change in the unemployment rate)27 and,
second, to the ďŹnancial markets (the change in the short-term and long-term interest
rates), with the exact deďŹnitions of the variables to be found in Table A.328. Our sample
consists of 24 EU countries available in NiGEM plus the four large economies of Australia,
Canada, Japan and the United States (see also the upper panel of Table A.7; we exclude
Croatia, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, and Norway because of lack of data in NiGEM).
This is a balanced panel data set with a total of 1,008 country-quarter observations for
the period from 2005Q1 to 2013Q4.29 Table A.4 provides descriptive statistics for the
variables entering the regression.

We use the two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach pro-

posed by Blundell and Bond (1998) to estimate the following linear dynamic model:

p(cid:88)

âNPLit =

ÎąkâNPLi(tâk) + Î˛(cid:48) (L) âMacroit + Îˇi + Ďit,

(5.1)

k=1

t = q + 1,ÂˇÂˇÂˇ , Ti,

i = 1,ÂˇÂˇÂˇ , N,

where the variable âNPLit is the change in the NPL ratios at time t compared to the
prior period and âNPLi(tâk) is the lagged change in the NPL ratios, âMacroit is a vector
of explanatory macroeconomic variables, Î˛(cid:48) (L) is a vector of associated polynomials in
the lag operator and q is the maximum lag length in the model. âMacroit consists of the

26First, the levels are very persistent. Second, we are predominantly interested in the inďŹuence of
macroeconomic factors on changes in NPL ratios. Last but not least, considering changes rather than
levels, we can better deal with diďŹerences in the deďŹnition of the NPLs in individual countries.

27The NPL ratios used in our model refer to total gross loans for a two-fold reason. First, a recent
Bundesbank study for Germany, France, Italy and Spain shows on the one hand that there is a pronounced
cyclical relationship between the annual growth rates of real loans to non-ďŹnancial corporations and the
corresponding growth rates of real GDP Deutsche Bundesbank (2015). Second, Minh, Dinh, Mullineaus,
and Muriu (2012) show, using the UK data, that unemployment appears to be the major macroeconomic
factor inďŹuencing loan losses for mortgage loans.

28We do not include variables that describe the credit cycle in our regression since they are not available
in NiGEM. However, there is evidence that loans to non-ďŹnancial corporations follow the business cycle
with a lagging pattern. Moreover, on the demand side, large ďŹrms may prefer ďŹnancing through corporate
bonds rather than through bank borrowing during periods when capital market conditions are favorable
(ECB, 2013).

29NPL ratios enter the regression starting in 2005Q1, whereas macroeconomic variables are used from

2004Q2 onwards to account for the maximum lag length of three quarters.

14

growth rate of real GDP (âGDPit), the change in the unemployment rate (âUNit), the
change in the short-term (âSRit) and long-term (âLRit) interest rates. Ti is the number
of time periods for which macroeconomic variables are available for the ith country and
N is the number of countries. In our case we have a balanced panel and Ti equals 39
quarters for every i and N equals 28 countries. Îˇi denotes the time-invariant unobservable
eďŹects â the country-speciďŹc eďŹects â and Ďit denotes the error term.

A number of studies (Nkusu, 2011; OeNB, 2002; DemirgÂ¨uÂ¸c-Kunt and Detragiache,
1998) describe the relationship between the macroeconomic variables and NPL ratios as
well as the expected signs of the corresponding regression coeďŹcients as follows:

â˘ In an economic upturn, there are few corporate insolvencies and credit defaults. As
a result, growth in real GDP will be negatively correlated to changes in NPL ratios.
By contrast, a higher unemployment rate is likely to be associated with an increase
in NPL ratios.

â˘ A rise in the long-term interest rate implies higher funding costs for enterprises and
households and therefore impairs their ability to repay loans. A large increase in
the short-term interest rate can be passed on to borrowers as well, especially due
to rising funding costs of banks. Additionally, a very large increase in the short-
term interest rate may lead to an inverted yield curve, which indicates the periods
of economic recession. Accordingly, an increase in both short-term and long-term
interest rates should be positively correlated with the changes in NPL ratios.

To account for the NPL persistence, we include two lags of the changes in NPL ratios,
expecting positive coeďŹcients. We consider the macroeconomic variables to be endogenous
to the model.30 The two-step Blundell-Bond estimation for small samples requires a
Windmeijer correction of the standard errors (Windmeijer, 2005). We apply a two-step
robust estimation using Stata.

5.2 Results of dynamic country panel analysis

Î˛LR = (cid:80)3

Table A.5 shows the results of the two-step Blundell-Bond estimation, including two
tests for autocorrelation as well as a test for overidentifying restrictions.31 Moreover,
in order to assess the cumulative impact of each explanatory variable on the change
in the NPL ratios, the table additionally reports the long-run coeďŹcients deďŹned as
k=1 Îąk). The coeďŹcients for the lagged NPL ratio are positive
and statistically signiďŹcant. This means that an increase in the change of the NPL ratios
in the last two quarters is likely to be followed by an increase in the current quarter.

k=1 Î˛k/(1 â(cid:80)2

30However, the number of groups in the cross-section imposes certain restrictions on the number of
instruments used for the endogenous variables. Too many instruments could lead to implausible results
in the speciďŹcation tests conducted by the Blundell-Bond estimator (particularly in the Hansen test);
see Roodman (2009b). Therefore, in our estimation procedure, we limit the number of instruments
according to the rule that the overall number of instruments for the endogenous variables should be as
close as possible to the number of groups in cross-section.

31Although, normally, in the dynamic panel regression, the R-sq is not reported we can use the R-sq
within from the corresponding ďŹxed-eďŹect estimator which is equal to 0.45 as a guide to the overall
goodness-of-ďŹt for our model. We also run the two-step Arellano-Bond estimation as a robustness test.
However, the results remain mostly the same.

15

The persistence of the NPL ratio growth is also conďŹrmed by Beck et al. (2013). Overall,
the macroeconomic variables in our model are fairly good at explaining the change in
the NPL ratios; they show the expected signs and a signiďŹcant impact.32 Our results are
generally in line with the ďŹndings of other recent studies (Beck et al., 2013; Louzis et al.,
2012; Nkusu, 2011).

The impact of the macroeconomic variables also appears to be signiďŹcant in economic
terms.33 Overall, for both the entire country sample and the GIPS countries, the economic
eďŹects from our empirical model show that if all macroeconomic factors are âstressedâ
simultaneously and their values increase by two standard deviations, the change in NPL
ratios also increases by more than two standard deviations. In terms of economic signiďŹ-
cance, the declining real GDP growth rate is the main driving force behind the deteriora-
tion in credit quality for the entire country sample. It is worth noting that the change in
the unemployment rate exerted a clear, economically signiďŹcant inďŹuence on the change
in NPL ratios. For the GIPS countries, the economic eďŹect from the increase in the un-
employment rate slightly outweighs the economic eďŹect from the decline in real GDP. For
the GIPS countries, the economic eďŹects from the change in the long-term interest rates
seem to play an important role as well.

Two diagnostic autocorrelation tests unambiguously attest the consistency of the dy-
namic Blundell-Bond estimator (see also Roodman, 2009a). As expected, the AR(1) test
rejects the null hypothesis that there is no ďŹrst-order autocorrelation in the diďŹerentiated
error terms. The more important AR(2) test cannot reject the null hypothesis that there
is no second-order autocorrelation in the diďŹerentiated error terms.

The third diagnostic Hansen test for overidentifying restrictions generally shows that
the instruments used are valid. It does not reject the null hypothesis which assumes that
the instruments do not correlate with a certain set of error terms.

Since we aim at using our model to project the NPL ratios as part of stress testing,
Figure A.2 demonstrates, using the GIPS countries as an example, the projections of the
NPL ratios for the period from 2015Q1 until 2018Q4 for the baseline and for all three
stress scenarios. With the exception of Portugal, the oil crisis scenario has the greatest
impact on the NPL ratios in the GIPS countries. In contrast to the ďŹnancial crisis and
the ďŹscal contraction scenarios, the oil crisis scenario comprises a global shock aďŹecting
all economies (albeit to varying degrees), creating a slump in aggregate demand at the
global level. Moreover, the inďŹationary impact of higher oil prices causes central banks
to raise short-term interest rates vigorously (in line with pre-set monetary policy rules).
This response in interest rates poses additional stress on the ďŹnancial system beyond the

32It is evident from the correlation matrix (not reported here) that there is a problem of multicollinearity
between the lagged change in the unemployment rate and growth in real GDP lagged by one or two
quarters. Despite this problem, the lagged change in the unemployment rate stays signiďŹcant in the
model. A robustness check using Arellano-Bond, ďŹxed-eďŹects and OLS estimations has shown that the
lagged change in the unemployment rate proves consistently signiďŹcant. We therefore decide to retain
the lagged change in the unemployment rate in the model, as the removal of an important explanatory
variable may result in model misspeciďŹcation and a biasing of the coeďŹcients for the variables remaining
in the model (Wooldridge, 2000). Additionally, while an adverse shock to aggregate demand lowers real
GDP and raises the unemployment rate, the degree of persistence of these responses diďŹers in NiGEM,
as the wage mechanism facilitates a return of the labor market to equilibrium.

33The economic eďŹect of a macroeconomic variable is calculated as two times its standard deviation
multiplied by its estimated long-run coeďŹcient. It is a usual practice in diďŹerent stress-testing models to
take two standard deviations in order to evaluate the stress levels.

impact of lower macroeconomic activity.

In the case of the oil price shock, the deviation of the NPL ratios from the baseline
in the period from mid-2016 to mid-2017 for Greece distinctly exceeds the 3pps mark
with the maximum value reaching 3 2
3pps, whereas it reaches nearly 3pps for Spain. The
reaction of Italy and Portugal is less strong with the largest deviation from the baseline
amounting to around 1 1
2pps for Italy and to roughly 1pp for Portugal. The maximum
absolute values of the NPL ratios during the same time span are the highest for Greece
at slightly above 36%, followed by Italy, Spain and Portugal with values at around 20%,
18% and 12%, respectively.

The second strongest reaction of the GIPS countries is observed in the ďŹnancial crisis
scenario. During the period from end-2016 to end-2017, the deviation of the NPL ratios
from the baseline reaches the highest value of over 3pps for Greece and of around 2 2
3pps
for Spain. Here too, Italy and Portugal show a less strong reaction with the highest values
at around 1 1
2pps. The maximum absolute values for the NPL ratios for Greece are slightly
above 35%, followed by Italy, Spain and Portugal with values, again, at about 20%, 18%
and 13%, respectively.

In the scenario of ďŹscal contraction we see a rather moderate reaction for the GIPS
countries. During the period from end-2016 to end-2017, the largest deviation of the NPL
ratios from the baseline is observed for Greece at slightly below 2pps, followed by Spain
at just over 1pp. The deviation of the NPL ratios from the baseline for Italy and Portugal
remains at the level of around 1pp for both countries. The maximum absolute values for
the NPL ratios are just over 34% for Greece, at around 19.5% for Italy, just over 16% for
Spain and at around 12.5% for Portugal.

6 Calibration of the Portfolio Model

6.1 Risk parameters

In order to calibrate the SystemicCreditRisk model described in Section 2, we ďŹrst deďŹne
risk parameters EADs, LGDs and PDs using the data from the German credit register.
The EAD is approximated by the total exposure of a bank to a borrower. Bank exposure
to borrowers is deďŹned fairly broadly. It includes not only loans but also bonds and other
securities in the banking book as well as derivatives and other oďŹ-balance sheet items.34
Taking into account collateral posted, the LGD is ďŹxed to 35% for the secured part of
the exposure and to 45% for the unsecured part. Additionally, the LGD is adjusted
for the eďŹect of guarantees provided by other banks. The PDs originate from internal
rating systems of the lenders and undergo a few corrections. Appendix A.3 provides more
technical details on EADs, LGDs and PDs.

34The following items are not reported in the credit register: exposures to German central and local
governments and communities (supposed to have zero PD), securities in the trading book, undrawn loan
commitments, shares in other enterprises. For a detailed deďŹnition of credit exposure and exceptions, see
Sections 19 and 20 of the German Banking Act, respectively (the version applied before 01.01.2014).

17

6.2 Copula of the systematic factors

The next step in the calibration of the portfolio model consists in the estimation of the
joint probability distribution of systematic factors for German sectors, foreign countries,
and remaining geographic regions.

The credit register assigns each corporate borrower to a country and an industry sec-
tor according to the Nomenclature statistique des activitÂ´es Â´economiques dans la Commu-
nautÂ´e europÂ´eenne (NACE) classiďŹcation and separates remaining retail borrowers into two
groups: households and non-proďŹt organizations. Based on that, we introduce M = 69
group-speciďŹc systematic factors. This includes, on the one hand, 28 sectors for German
borrowers. Foreign borrowers, on the other hand, are only grouped either by country or
by region of their residence (since there are not always enough borrowers per group to
allow a ďŹner breakdown). Thus, in addition to German sectors, we consider 32 single
foreign countries (Table A.7) and nine remaining geographic regions. The regions are de-
ďŹned in accordance with the deďŹnition of country groups used in the balance of payments
statistics.

Tables A.6 and A.7 provide sectoral, country and regional breakdown of exposure of
the 12 banks as well as the historic average share of loans in each of these groups. This
overview shows that approximately half of large loans by major German banks have been
extended to German borrowers and that the domestic exposure is concentrated in the
ďŹnancial sector (on average, exposure to banks and other ďŹnancial intermediaries has
made up around 75% of the reported large domestic loans).35

We calibrate the joint distribution of systematic factors in two steps. First, we es-
timate parameters of the marginal gamma distributions of the group-speciďŹc systematic
factors. Then, we ďŹt their copula to the data. For this purpose, we need historical data
that reďŹects (joint) variability of defaults per sector, country and region. In the Cred-
itRisk+ context, related literature suggests using historical default rates; see, for example,
Boegelein, Hamerle, Knapp, and RÂ¨osch (2004). Such data is very scarce, though.36 For-
tunately, since 2008, the credit register has contained, on borrower level, data on speciďŹc
provisions for impairment losses. Using them, we can approximate annualized default

35Around 60% of the domestic exposure are concentrated in the banking sector. Therefore, we argue,
it is essential to consider this exposure. Other studies with a similar top-down stress-testing set-up
also choose portfolio structure which includes exposure to ďŹnancial institutions (Castre, Fitzpatrick, and
Sydow, 2009; Riksbank, 2006). Some authors (DÂ¨ullmann and Kick, 2014, who focus on export-oriented
sectors) argue that exposure to banks is diďŹerent in terms of the amount secured by collateral and in
terms of maturity structure; thus, they exclude it from their analysis. However, in our study, we take
into account the amount of collateral posted. In this respect we do not diďŹerentiate between exposure
to banks and other exposures. Additionally, there is also empirical evidence that the average length
of contracts in the interbank market is well above one year (Bluhm, George, and Krahnen, 2016). In
the central bank models such as the BoEâs RAMSI, the ECBâs stress-testing approach and the OeNBâs
SRM, the interbank market appears to be an integral part of the top-down stress-testing framework
as well. However, these models focus mere on network eďŹects and contagion in the interbank market.
Admittedly, considering credit exposure to banking sector within the scope of our portfolio model is a
ďŹrst step towards a more-sophisticated stress-testing framework.

36Since the actual default rate history accumulated by banks is not available to researchers, published
statistics on insolvency rates are often used instead. However, data restrictions do not allow us to
pursue this estimation strategy. Although the German Federal Statistical OďŹce publishes annual data
on insolvency rates, the sector breakdown diďŹers from the NACE classiďŹcation used in the credit register.
Moreover, it is diďŹcult to obtain insolvency statistics for all countries and regions included in the model.

18

rates per sector/country/region for each quarter. To accomplish this, we take four con-
secutive quarters at a time and calculate the share of borrowers with speciďŹc provisions
in the respective group. By doing so, we take account of lending from all German banks,
as reported in the credit register.37

The default statistics serve as a data basis for parameter calibration. First, we use
them for setting the parameters of the marginal gamma distributions of the group-speciďŹc
systematic factors. For each factor, we apply Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for
truncated samples to the historical group-speciďŹc default rates. We assume that samples
are right truncated with a known point of truncation that equals the maximum observed
value of default statistics for this group. The estimation procedure boils down to MLE
that does not simply use a gamma probability distribution function fg(x; Îą) to deďŹne its
objective function, but also takes into account the cumulative probability of observing
the data up to the point of truncation fg(x; Îą)/Fg(xtr; Îą); see Hughes (1962, p. 21 f.). In
some rare cases, the MLE may fail. Here, we suggest using sample moments for pinning
down distribution parameters. The estimated gamma distributions are then normalized
to have the mean of one. Tables A.6 and A.7 provide a schematic overview of the resulting
gamma distributions.

We then use the default statistics to calibrate the structure and dependence parame-
ters of the copula that joins all systematic factors. To estimate parameters Î¸ at diďŹerent
levels of the hierarchy of the Gumbel HAC copula, we utilize routines from the âHAC
packageâ in R programming environment (R Core Team, 2014). The HAC package docu-
mentation by Okhrin and Ristig (2012, p. 4 f.) describes the multi-stage MLE procedure
implemented, and Appendix A.2 brieďŹy summarizes the main steps of the estimation
algorithm. MLE is performed such as to neglect small diďŹerences in the strength of de-
pendence between diďŹerent systematic factors and, on the other hand, with the goal of
preserving a reasonably granular copula structure.38

Figures A.3 to A.5 present the estimated HAC in all details and show its 44 depen-
dence parameters. For reasons of clear presentation, we divide the HAC into many parts:
sub-copulas C[1] to C[5] and a âtopâ copula. Here, we brieďŹy describe the estimated
dependence structure. Sub-copulas C[1] and C[4] mostly join German sectors. The esti-
mated parameters suggest that, historically, default statistics approximated based on the
data for speciďŹc provisioning by German banks were closely associated for the following

37Similar approaches have been pursued in the related literature before; see, for instance, Memmel,
GÂ¨undÂ¨uz, and Raupach (2012) for German borrowers. The authors approximate historical default statistics
by the rates of write-downs obtained from the German borrowers statistics. The quarterly borrowers
statistics collected by the Bundesbank contain information on loans to domestic borrowers as well as
write-downs (write-ups) aggregated at the level of diďŹerent industries and groups of retail borrowers.
Information on foreign borrowers is not collected, however, which precludes consideration of the borrowers
statistics in our study.

38In order to check the robustness of estimation results for the joint distribution function of the system-
atic factors (their marginal distributions and the copula), we have additionally performed estimation that
includes the most recent data up to 2015Q4. The results (not reported here) show that there are some
changes in dependence parameters and in the composition of groups (sub-copulas) of German sectors
and/or foreign countries. These changes in the overall dependence structure, however, do not aďŹect the
results for banksâ capital requirements considerably.

19

sectors in Germany:

((((construction (S19) and housing companies (S20)) and
(households (S26) and food service (S22))) and other real estate (S21)) and
other services (S25),

as shown in C[1], and, as shown in C[4], for:

(((metals and metal products (S6) and machinery (S7)) and
((wood, furniture, paper, printing (S9) and textiles (S10)) and
(renting and leasing (S14) and equity investment (S18)) and
computers, electronic (S8))) and a number of others).

On the other hand, the arguments of sub-copulas C[3] and C[5] are mostly countries
and regions. C[3] includes Sweden, Norway and other countries in Europe (1031) as
well as Spain and remaining countries in the Americas (1036). C[5] joins Slovenia and
Poland, Croatia and remaining countries in Europe (1032), Malta and Cyprus, Denmark,
Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Portugal and Greece as well as Luxembourg and Austria.
The sub-copula C[2] has mixed arguments, including most of the remaining sectors in
Germany and Canada and the USA and other main countries in the Americas (1035), as
well as remaining countries in Asia (1038) and Africa (1034). At the top level, we see
that in the past the default statistics for Bulgaria evolved virtually independently of the
rest of the portfolio and even more so in the case of Japan, Latvia and Hungary.

Additionally, ďŹgures presented in Appendix A.4 show as an example small segments
of the copula that represent pairwise realizations for a number of selected variables. Fig-
ure A.6 presents 500 pairwise realizations for seven selected industry sectors in Germany.
It demonstrates for the ďŹnancial sector that the copula produces the strongest link be-
tween equity investment ďŹrms and other non-bank ďŹnancial intermediators (including
money market fonds). The link to the rates of bank defaults is substantially weaker. The
interdependence between systematic factors for the sector âinsurance companiesâ and for
all three other groups of ďŹnancial intermediaries is of a medium-scale order of magni-
tude.
Interestingly, the positive association between construction, housing companies,
and other real estate activities is next to perfect. Next, Figure A.7 shows a number of
selected countries.
It illustrates a strong default correlation for the USA and Canada
and a relatively close association with defaults on the Australian exposure. As for the
group of countries on which we focus our scenario analysis, the HAC generates a tight de-
pendence between systematic factors for Greek, Italian and Portuguese credit exposures.
Interestingly, credit losses in Spain are more closely related to the group of countries we
described ďŹrst. Between both groups, no considerable dependence can be detected.

The combination of the univariate gamma marginal distributions and the hierarchical
Gumbel-copula makes up the joint M -dimensional distribution function of the systematic
factors. This completes our deďŹnition of the dependence structure in the proposed port-
folio model. What remains to be described is the link between the portfolio model and
the macroeconomic scenarios.

20

6.3 The link between NPL ratio projections and the portfolio

model

To embed the portfolio model SystemicCreditRisk into the stress testing framework, we
perform a percentile mapping between the NPL ratios and the systematic factors that
will conduct the eďŹect of macroeconomic projections to the borrower PDs.39 For this
purpose, we ďŹrst ďŹt gamma distributions to the country-speciďŹc observations of the NPL
ratios (similarly to the procedure applied for the systematic factors). Then, given a
realization of the NPL ratio for a country in a macro scenario, we calculate to which
percentile of the ďŹtted gamma distribution this realization corresponds. This percentile
serves in the following simulation as the lower threshold for the systematic factor(s) for
this country. Conditioning on the percentiles means that acceptable realizations of the
systematic factors can only lie above the speciďŹed thresholds. Thus, sampled systematic
factors cannot be âbetterâ than suggested by the scenario, but they can be âworseâ. The
percentile mapping is done for those 28 countries for which NPL ratio projections are
available.40 Even if no percentile mapping is possible for the remaining ďŹve countries and
geographic regions, the corresponding sampled systematic factors will depend on stress
scenarios, too. The reason for this is that realizations of all systematic factors have to
exceed their respective thresholds simultaneously. This constrains the area of the HAC
from which sampling is performed. That is, all systematic factors are sampled from a
small, âstressedâ part of the copula.

Figure A.8 illustrates the percentiles of the estimated gamma distributions that cor-
respond to NPL ratio projections per country in each scenario. For countries such as
France, Netherlands or Germany, where historical NPL ratios over the observation period
were not very high, the stressed, large values of NPL ratios lie in the far right tail of the
distribution. That is, they represent rare events for these countries. By contrast, for GIPS
countries with a historic record of high NPL ratios, realizations from stress scenarios seem
to be more commonplace, so the NPL ratio percentiles are lower.

6.4 Simulation of portfolio losses

The NPL ratio projections determine from which part of the estimated copula systematic
factors can be drawn. The sampled simulated factors will aďŹect borrower PDs and,
ultimately, the distribution of credit portfolio losses in accordance with the simulation
procedure described in Section 2.3.

For our simulation study, we use the data from the credit register as of the end of
2013 and assume a static balance sheet. Thus, we sample portfolio losses (PL) quarter-
by-quarter, scenario after scenario based on the same portfolio composition. The time
span of simulation covers 20 quarters from 2014Q1 until 2018Q4.41

39A direct link between the macro model and the portfolio model is problematic. On the one hand,
NPL ratios are not reported in the credit register. On the other hand, there is no breakdown of NPL
ratios by sector in Germany. Similarly, the data on NPL ratios covers only a limited sub-sample of
countries reported in the credit register.

40In Germany, one country-speciďŹc percentile threshold applies to all domestic sectors.
41For the year 2014 only the baseline scenario is used. Stress scenarios start in 2015Q1. The ďŹrst
realization of all stress scenarios coincides with the baseline, however. Therefore, for the stress scenarios,
we only perform sampling starting with 2015Q2.

21

First, we draw joint realizations of the 69 systematic factors using their constrained
copula. The resulting sample only contains realizations that lie above the âstressedâ NPL
ratio thresholds. Figure A.9 demonstrates the magnitude of the systematic factors in the
oil crisis scenario for a number of selected sectors and countries. The systematic factors
scale up PDs for the borrowers in Italy, Greece and Portugal as high as by a factor of
approximately 3 to 4. For Spain and, for instance, the United Kingdom, the scaling
factors of around 2 apply. The same is true of the German real estate sector (excluding
housing companies) and the banking sector. For other domestic ďŹnancial intermediaries,
the oil crisis scenario aďŹects only a moderate increase in PDs of some 50%. Similar scaling
factors apply to French borrowersâ PDs.

In the next simulation step, we draw default indicators for all borrowers using PDs
conditional on a realization of systematic factors and calculate the banksâ portfolio losses.
Figure A.10 shows a few examples of PL distributions after performing ten million sim-
ulation runs. Comparing PL distribution under the baseline and the oil crisis scenario,
we see that not only the magnitude of simulated losses but also sometimes the shape of
distribution change considerably under the stress scenario, shifting both bank portfolios
and the systemâs portfolios into a more dangerous area of high credit risk.

Based on the sampled distribution, we calculate relevant risk measures as described
at the end of Section 2.3. For the simulations under the baseline and stress scenarios we
focus on the system-wide tail risk represented by the systemâs ES. In order to calculate
the systemâs ES, we ďŹx the percentile threshold at a lower of q = 99%, which accounts in
a non-formal way for a limited probability of scenario occurrence.42

For the purpose of policy application introduced in the next section, we additionally
compute the banksâ individual EL and VaR based on an unconditional simulation of
credit portfolio losses, i.e. without regard to any macroeconomic scenarios or NPL ratio
projections. This means that the area of the copula, from which systematic factors are
sampled, is not constrained by any percentile conditions; we draw realizations from the
entire HAC.43 Running the unconditional simulation for individual banks, we take the
regulatory threshold for credit-VaR calculation given as q = 99.9%.44

Both scenario-based and unconditional risk metrics described above can be utilized
(alongside other supervisory information and risk assessment results) for assessing micro-
and macroprudential capital needs, as the next section describes. In contrast to a mere
stand-alone risk assessment for every single bank, this approach incorporates a systemic
view of capital adequacy.

42In this context, q reďŹects the regulatorâs tolerance towards the probability of a systemic event, as
In our case, the latter is given by 100 â q = 1%
pointed out by Puzanova and DÂ¨ullmann (2013).
conditional on a scenario. Why use ES and not VaR at the systemâs level? Consider that VaR only
represents minimum loss in the worst (100â q)% of cases. Thus, it might be an appropriate risk measure
from the bank ownersâ point of view because their liability given the bankâs default is limited. The
regulator, however, has to care about the losses that a bank failure may incur, i.e. in formal terms, the
expected losses given that the losses exceed the VaR threshold. This is exactly the deďŹnition of ES that
represents expected loss in the worst (100 â q)% of cases. Therefore, ES is a more appropriate measure
of externalities than VaR.

43To ensure a better coverage of the entire copula (as opposed to only a small part of the copula
conditional on NPL ratio scenarios), we increase the number of joint drawings of the systematic factors
by factor 10 (10,000 drawings). In turn, we reduce the number of simulation runs for default indicators
by the same factor (1,000 drawings) to ensure that the sampling remains computationally feasible.
44This means that the regulator tolerates a bankâs unconditional probability of default of 100âq = 0.1%.

7 Results and Policy Applications

7.1 Overall assessment

This section presents an overall assessment of the capability of the system as a whole to
withstand severe macroeconomic shocks. Figure A.11 summarizes the results obtained
for the systemâs portfolio that consists of all credit exposures of the 12 banks. It presents
EL and ES at the system level calculated under the unconditional and scenario-based
simulations using the SystemicCreditRisk model. These risk metrics suggest that, if we
only consider shocks to the banksâ credit portfolios, the systemâs ES in the unconditional
simulation amounts to no more than 13% of the aggregated credit RWA and 62% of the
aggregate common equity tier 1 (CET1) of the 12 banks. In the scenario analysis, the
systemâs ES never exceeds 18% of the reported credit RWA or 88% of the available CET1
capital. Thus, in aggregate, there is seemingly enough capital to support the systemâs tail
credit risk.

But the heterogenous results at the bank level presented below tend to tell another
story. Although a number of banks appear very well capitalized to withstand even the
maximum stress imposed by the scenarios, other banksâ capital level might need im-
provement in order to suďŹciently reďŹect tail risk externality. This indicates that the
distribution of capital in the banking system is not necessarily optimal from a systemic
point of view.45 This results remain stable also when we include more resent data from
the credit register for the purpose of model calibration and portfolio loss simulations.

7.2 Micro- and macroprudential capital requirements

This section shows how to calibrate micro- and macroprudential capital requirements for
individual banks based on the risk measures provided by the model and reports model-
based requirements for the 12 banks under consideration.

The M-PRESS-CreditRisk framework features a holistic micro- and macroprudential
approach to capital adequacy assessment in the banking sector. Properly adapted, it
can inform decisions both on CET1 capital requirements of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 and on
macroprudential buďŹers such as the systemic risk buďŹer (SRB) and the buďŹer for other
systemically important institutions (O-SII). Figure 7.1 outlines these model applications
embedded into the overall structure of capital requirements, and the next paragraphs
walk us through them. Additionally, the model provides information that can be used for
building loan loss provisions in a forward-looking way.46

45A reallocation of capital according to the banksâ systemic risk contributions can reduce risk in the
banking system, especially by decreasing the probability of multiple defaults; see Gauthier, Lehar, and
Souissi (2012).

46From the range of macroprudential capital tools, we omit the counter-cyclical buďŹer because it is
tied, in the ďŹrst place, to aggregate credit growth; see Detken et al. (2014). On the other hand, we
do not consider the capital surcharge for global systemically important institutions. According to the
Basel methodology (BCBS, 2013), setting this buďŹer requires detailed information on a wide range of the
worldsâ major banks, which is not available to us. For both these instruments, Puzanova and DÂ¨ullmann
(2013) suggest an alternative: a credit portfolio-based approach. Another tool not considered here is the
capital conservation buďŹer. This is deďŹned as a ďŹxed percentage (2.5%) of an institutionâs risk-weighted
assets and, therefore, does not require any modeling.

23

Figure 7.1: Model-based CET 1 capital requirements and loan loss provisions

Forward-looking provisioning should cover expected future losses. The model
developed in this paper suggests that a cushion against the losses expected one year ahead
equals the unconditional expected loss of a bank, denoted in the ďŹgure as ELbank
uncond. The
metric is computed as the mean of a bankâs credit portfolio loss distribution obtained
from an unconditional simulation. In our example EL ranges from around 1% to roughly
4% of the banksâ credit exposure reported in the credit register. At the aggregated level,
it amounts to about 2% of the credit exposure of the system.

The aim of forward-looking provisioning is to absorb expected losses. Minimum capital
requirements and capital buďŹers, on the other hand, are intended to protect individual
banks and the system as a whole from losses that exceed the expected amount, i.e. from
unexpected losses. Unexpected losses are less likely to materialize, but if they do, they
can bring an undercapitalized institution â or, in an extreme event, even a large part
of the banking system â to the brink of bankruptcy. Against this backdrop, the present
paper focuses on addressing unexpected losses by means of both microprudential minimum
capital requirements and macroprudential add-ons and buďŹers.

Minimum capital requirements under Pillar 1 represent the minimum amount of
capital that a bank must have in order to cover unexpected losses at a one-year risk horizon
calculated in accordance with regulatory standards.
In general, the regulator deďŹnes
unexpected credit loss as the diďŹerence between VaR (99.9% percentile) and expected
loss computed for the credit portfolio of a bank in the unconditional simulation.
uncond â ELbank

In our framework, this metric corresponds to the unexpected loss at the bank-level
obtained from the unconditional simulation and denoted as V aRbank
uncond. Thus
calculated, the unexpected loss can be compared to the regulatory capital reported by a
given bank. Any comparison should, however, account for diďŹerences in the underlying
calculation prescriptions between the regulatory standards under Pillar 1 and our model-
based ďŹgures. The former is computed using either pre-deďŹned risk weights (standardized
approach) or based on the assumptions of a perfectly diversiďŹed portfolio (internal rating-
based approach), which neglects credit concentration risk. In contrast, our model-based

minimum capital requirement for credit risk goes beyond the coverage of the Pillar 1 and
additionally accounts for the concentration risk, arising from imperfect portfolio diversi-
ďŹcation with respect to economic sectors and geographical regions.47

As Figure 7.2 summarizes, the model-based microprudential capital requirement ranges
from 4% to 16% in terms of the credit RWA of a bank and from 17% to 119% in terms
of the CET1 capital, reported for the end of 2013. According to the model-based uncon-
ditional simulations, all but one bank have enough capital to back their credit risk. The
average value amounts to 7% and 35%, respectively, where the average value is calculated
as the sum over the unconditional unexpected losses of individual banks divided by the

Additional Pillar 2 capital requirements, should cover volatility over the business
cycle (EBA, 2014, Â§358 ďŹ.), i.e. risks to which a bank may expect to become exposed
47Usually, concentration risk is addressed under Pillar 2, see BCBS (2006, Â§ 772) and EBA (2014, Title
7). More generally, those risks to which an institution might be exposed beyond the coverage of Pillar 1
requirements should be taken into account under Pillar 2. If the risks not accounted for under Pillar 1
are addressed by any existing capital buďŹer requirements, including macroprudential buďŹers, Pillar 2
requirements should be oďŹset against those buďŹers if they address the same risk (no double charge); see
EBA (2014, Â§ 346). Note, however, that diďŹerent jurisdictions apply diďŹerent approaches to exercising
the supervisory powers under Pillar 2; compare, for instance, EBA (2014) with PRA (2015).

We deďŹne the ES of the banking system as the
relevant tail risk metric. It shows how much loss the banking systemâs aggregate credit
portfolio is expected to incur in the event that the loss exceeds the systemâs VaR. The
supervisor should impose an additional capital charge to back this tail risk.48 For this
purpose, the Pillar 2 capital add-on can be calculated as the banksâ contribution to the
systemâs ES in the baseline scenario minus the banksâ VaR from unconditional simulation
that was already addressed under Pillar 1: (ESsys.contr

baseline â V aRbank

uncond)+.

Depending on the macroeconomic projections, the banksâ contributions to the systemâs
ES expressed in euro vary over time. This gives rise to a time-varying Pillar 2 capital add-
on. Its maximum value per bank observed during the 20 quarters for which we generate
NPL ratio projections, is shown in Figure 7.2. The add-on ranges between around 1% to
6.5% of credit RWA or 5% to 34% of CET1 capital. The average ďŹgures come to 3% and
15%, respectively.

Although not a macroprudential instrument per se, the Pillar 2 add-on suggested in
this paper takes a system-wide view on capital adequacy. This perspective is central to
the application of macroprudential instruments, two of which we consider in the following
paragraphs: the SRB and the O-SII buďŹer.49

The systemic risk buďŹer is a macroprudential capital tool available to banking
supervisors in the EU.50 It aims at mitigating long-term non-cyclical systemic risk not
covered by other instruments. We argue that the SRB can be applied to ensure that even
in a severe stress scenario the system as a whole can cover its tail risk. To guide decisions
on the possible size and timing of the buďŹer, we suggest using the model-based estimates of
the systemâs ES under stress. In particular, for each of the relevant supervisory scenarios,
the euro amount of the systemâs ES can be calculated quarter by quarter and compared
to the systemâs ES in the baseline scenario. The maximum positive diďŹerence to the
baseline indicates the maximum excess systemic credit risk that should be covered by the
aggregate SRB requirement: SRBsys = max(ESsys
baseline)+. The capital charge
for each single bank equals to the amount of additional capital needed in the entire
system multiplied by the bankâs average percentage share in the systemâs ES: SRBbank =
SRBsys Âˇ ESsys.share.51 Since the ES shares remain remarkably stable, we simply take
the average shares over all considered scenarios. The quarter in which the maximum
diďŹerence is observed indicates the time period up to which the banks should have built
up the buďŹer.

stress â ESsys

In our particular example, the oil crises scenario generates the greatest adverse impact
on the NPL ratios and portfolio loss. Therefore, the SRB is based on this scenario. This
diďŹerence between the systemâs ES in oil crisis and baseline scenario reaches its maximum

48The intention is that the owners â rather than the deposit insurance schemes or the public â bear

the risk of losses.

49The capital regulation does not provide a deďŹnite clear cut between macro- and macroprudential
instruments. From the economic perspective, however, we can argue that capital charges based on a
standalone assessment of risk of individual banks serve microprudential purposes. On the other hand,
instruments that address risks gauged from the systemic perspective, taking externalities into account
(see Section 1), pursue macroprudential objectives.

50Article 133 of Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive IV or CRD IV).
51Note that article 133(9) of the CRD IV allows the application of diďŹerent SRB requirements for
diďŹerent subsets of institutions. If the macroprudential authority nevertheless decides to apply a level
SRB charge for all relevant institutions, any positive diďŹerence between (i) SRBsys deďŹned above for an
individual bank and (ii) the level charge imposed can be accounted for under Pillar 2.

26

in the 15th simulation quarter or 2017Q3; see Figure A.12. Until this time, the banks
should have (gradually) built up the SRB. The buďŹer ranges for individual banks from
about 1.4% to 5.9% of credit RWA or from around 7% to 43% of the CET1 capital reported
at the end of 2013. The average ďŹgures amount to 2.8% and 13.6%, respectively.

The O-SII buďŹer is a European supplement to the capital buďŹer designed in the
Basel III framework for the global systemically important banks (G-SIB). It has a more
local focus, and should internalize the risk which the failure of a large and interconnected
institution located in the EU poses for the banking system of the EU as a whole or its
member states.52 According to article 131(5) of the CRD IV, O-SIIs may be required to
maintain an O-SII buďŹer of up to 2% of the RWA. In Germany, for instance, the identiďŹed
O-SIIs are assigned to one of four groups with gradually decreasing buďŹers of 2%, 1.5%,
1% and 0.5% of their total RWA.53

Following the currently applied methodology, we suggest an approach to how to di-
vide the banks into the pre-deďŹned four buckets according to their systemic importance,
taking the level of the respective capital buďŹers as given. We gauge the banksâ systemic
importance based to their mean relative share in the systemâs ES, i.e. ESsys.share, and
apply the k-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm assigns banks with the largest
ESsys.share into Group 1. The other groups follow as shown in Figure 7.3.54

The sum of all capital requirements suggested by our model at hand can be seen
in Figure 7.2. Here, only the maximum of SRB and O-SII buďŹer is taken into account;
not both requirements.55 The smallest capital charge totals 6.3% of credit RWA. The
corresponding bank reports nearly three times as much CET1 as required by the model.56
The highest capital charge in terms of credit RWA totals 27.2%; the corresponding bank
reported nearly 8pps less CET1 capital than the suggested combined model-based capital
charge for credit risk. Four other banks, labeled bank 2, 3, 4 and 7 in the ďŹgure, also
reported less capital than our maximum model-based charge, the diďŹerence being 96, 14,
50 and 9pps, respectively. Therefore, our results emphasize that the distribution of capital
among the banks might not be consistent with a macroprudential risk assessment.

Further research. In this paper we have shown how a novel approach to model sys-
temic credit risk can be embedded in a general macroprudential stress testing framework.
Because of its ďŹexibility, this framework can accommodate further important features left

52See BCBS (2013) for the G-SIB framework and article 131(5) of the CRD IV for the O-SII buďŹers. The
latter represent the Unionâs implementation of the Basel framework for dealing with domestic systemically
important banks (BCBS, 2012).

53https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Eigenmittel_BA/dl_methode_asri_ba.pdf.
54The k-means clustering divides entities into a predeďŹned number of groups by maximizing the distance
between the clustersâ means. This method was applied by Puzanova and DÂ¨ullmann (2013) to the G-SIBsâ
contributions to the systemâs ES.

55Since both the SRB and the O-SII buďŹer target the same cross-sectional dimension of systemic risk
(although possible from diďŹerent angles), in most common cases, only the maximum of SRB and O-SII
would be applicable. More precise, the maximum of the SRB, O-SII, and the G-SIB buďŹer would apply;
but speciďŹc calculations may occur; see articles 131(14-15) and 133(4-5) of the CRD IV.

56The results should be interpreted with caution, bearing in mind that the model only considers a
part of credit risk attributed to the exposures reported in the credit register. The calculated maximum
requirement does not, however, include capital charges for the remaining credit risk, market risk, oper-
ational risk or credit valuation adjustment. We also do not consider the following capital instruments:
the capital conservation buďŹer, the counter-cyclical capital buďŹer and the buďŹer for global systemically
important institutions.

for future research: a network extension to the credit risk model that will incorporate di-
rect and indirect contagion through the interbank exposure and asset ďŹre sales; dynamic
projections of bank balance sheets and income statements; market and operational risk
models. Moreover, in tandem with a capital stress test, liquidity buďŹers should be chal-
lenged by funding shocks in order to assess the overall resilience of the system (see Hirtle
and Lehnert, 2014, p. 8). Most importantly, a comprehensive macroprudential approach
to stress testing needs to include the feedback eďŹects of a possible credit contraction and
asset reallocation on the real economy. Obviously, the output risk metrics of an extended
modeling framework will be diďŹerent in numbers from those presented in the paper. This
will not, however, aďŹect the logic of the coherent approach to capital adequacy assessment
from the micro- and macroprudential perspective which we propose.

8 Conclusions

This paper develops an advanced portfolio model for credit risk assessment in a bank-
ing sector called SystemicCreditRisk and embeds it into a novel stress testing framework
which can inform decisions on micro- and macroprudential capital requirements under
systemic stress with focus on credit risk: M-PRESS-CreditRisk. From a technical point
of view we add to the literature by developing a detailed dependence structure (copula)
that can capture the externality of tail risk, i.e. risk of extreme losses that materialize only

from diďŹerent industry sectors and countries in a non-linear way. This approach accounts
for many simultaneous borrower defaults across banksâ portfolios and, therefore, incorpo-
rates credit default concentration risk in a banking system. Consequently, portfolio loss
distributions of individual banks and the entire system show a higher likelihood of large
losses. In comparison with Basel II and similar approaches based on simplifying assump-
tions of perfectly diversiďŹed portfolios, no concentration risk, linear dependencies, absence
of clustering borrower defaults and banks that are independent from each other (no sys-
temic risk), our model considerably reduces the scope for the possible underestimation of
credit risk in the banking system.

Additionally to the SystemicCreditRisk model, M-PRESS-CreditRisk consists of the
module that generates multi-risk-factor, multi-country stress scenarios designed for our
application in NiGEM and the satellite macro-econometric model that helps to translate
these scenarios into the credit portfolio model. As to the policy applications, we show how
the risk metrics derived from the combination of the portfolio model and scenario analysis
can inform supervisorsâ judgment about the level of capital needed in the banking system
to cover both expected and unexpected losses under normal and adverse macroeconomic
conditions (baseline and stress scenarios, respectively). To this end, the framework pro-
vides model-based measures of both bank-level and systemic credit risk that supervisors
may use in their assessment of the whole chain of capital adequacy: starting with dynamic
loan loss provisioning, proceeding with minimum capital requirements, including Pillar 2
add-ons, and ďŹnishing with macroprudential buďŹers that address structural systemic risk.
We also illustrate how the framework may be put into practice, using a sample of 12
systemically important German banks and utilizing a baseline and three stress scenarios
(oil crisis, ďŹnancial crisis, and ďŹscal contraction). Based on the results, we argue that the
actual capital levels and the capital needs calculated with additional regard to systemic
credit risk may diďŹer considerably. Moreover, although the aggregate capital ďŹgures
suggest that there is enough capital in the system as a whole to withstand severe adverse
macroeconomic scenarios, the analysis on the bank level indicates that the distribution of
capital in the banking system might be suboptimal from a systemic point of view. This
follows from the observation that a number of banks show excess capital compared to
the overall requirement calibrated to the systemic risk metrics from our model, whereas
another banksâ capital base needs improvement.
In the worst case, ďŹve banks would
have diďŹculties satisfying the combined model-based micro- and macroprudential capital
requirements.

At the end, we must emphasize that our numerical results should be treated with
caution because our model is subject to a number of constraints. First, it only focuses on
credit risk, whereas regulatory requirements also address other risk sources such as market
and operational risk. Second, our model concentrates on only one channel of systemic risk
propagation represented by the correlated bank exposures; contagion among the banks or
other second-round eďŹects are not considered here. Finally, M-PRESS-CreditRisk links a
number of approaches together which introduces an additional layer of model risk.

Bearing these caveats in mind, the risk measures generated in the coherent stress
testing framework of M-PRESS-CreditRisk may help supervisors think of diďŹerent micro-
and macroprudential capital instruments as a logically linked chain of requirements and
support the calibration of bank-speciďŹc capital charges.

A Appendix

A.1 Gamma distribution

A random variable X is gamma distributed if its probability distribution function reads

f (x) =

1

Î(k)Îąk xkâ1eâx/Îą,

x â [0,â), k > 0, Îą > 0.

(A.1)

Parameters k and Îą control the shape and scale of the distribution, respectively. The
expected value and the variance of X are given by E[X] = kÎą and var(X) = kÎą2. This
leads to the following method of moments parameter estimators:

Ëk =

ÂŻx2
s2

and ËÎą =

s2
ÂŻx

where ÂŻx and s2 are the sample mean and variance, respectively. The objective function
for MLE can be obtained from Equation (A.1).

Let X be a gamma random variable with parameters k and Îą. Then, the normalized
gamma variable Y := X/E[X] has unity expectation, and its distribution function can be
described using only the variance: var(Y ) = var(X)/E[X] = 1/k = Îą.

A.2 Basics of copulas

A comprehensive introduction to the copula theory may be found in Nelsen (1999); Joe
(1997). The gist of the copula concept can be explained in a few paragraphs, though.
Consider a joint cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a random vector. This comprises
information about each single random variable and information about the interdependen-
cies between the random variables. We can separate these two pieces of information in a
formal way. That is, each joint cdf can be expressed in terms of its univariate marginal
distributions and a unique function â called copula â that describes its dependence struc-
ture. The Sklarâs theorem formalizes this idea (for proof see, for instance, Nelsen, 1999,
p. 18).

Theorem A.1 (Sklar )

Let H be a continuous joint cdf of a random vector (X1, . . . , XN ) with univariate
marginal cdfs FXi with i = 1, . . . , N . There exists a unique copula function C :
[0, 1]N (cid:55)â [0, 1] such as for all xi â RâŞ{ââ,â} with i = 1, . . . , N the following holds

H(x1, . . . , xN ) = C(cid:0)FX1(x1), . . . , FXN (xN )(cid:1).

(A.2)
[0, 1]N (cid:55)â [0, 1] and continuous cdfs
The converse is also true: given a copula C :
FXi with i = 1, . . . , N the function H in Equation (A.2) is an N -dimensional cdf with
univariate margins FX1, . . . , FXN .

A copula itself is a joint cdf on the N -dimensional unit hypercube. It has uniform mar-
gins that represent the cdfs of the probability-integral transforms of the original random
variables given by U := FX(X):

C(u1, . . . , uN ) = H(cid:0)F â1

X1

(uN )(cid:1),

(u1), . . . , F â1

XN

u1, . . . , uN â [0, 1].

A copula is invariant under strictly monotone transformations of the random variables.
The same is true of copula-based dependence measures. We deďŹne two such (bivariate)
measures: Kendallâs rank correlation and coeďŹcient of tail dependence.

DeďŹnition A.1 (Kendallâs rank correlation)

Let (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) be two iid random vectors. Then Kendallâs rank correlation,
denoted Ď , is given by

Ď (X, Y ) = Pr{(X1 â X2)(Y1 â Y2) > 0} â Pr{(X1 â X2)(Y1 â Y2) < 0} .

(A.3)

The ďŹrst term in Equation (A.3) is the probability of concordance of the two random
vectors. The second term is the probability of discordance.

The invariance of Kendallâs Ď to transformations of the marginals is an advantage
over the Pearsonâs product-moment correlation. The Pearsonâs Ď only describes the linear
relationship between variables; it measures how well the random variables cluster around a
linear function. Therefore, Ď is a natural measure of association for multivariate normally
and, more generally, elliptically distributed random variables. For other multivariate
distributions, measures of concordance like Ď are more appropriate because they are more
general and reďŹect the degree to which random variables cluster around a monotone

36

function (with linear functions being only one of the special cases).

DeďŹnition A.2 (CoeďŹcients of tail dependence)

Pr(cid:8)X2 > F â1
Pr(cid:8)X2 â¤ F â1

X2

X2

(u)(cid:9)
(u)(cid:9) ,

Let X1 and X2 be random variables with cdfs FX1 and FX2. The coeďŹcients of upper
and lower tail dependence of X1 and X2, denoted ÎťU and ÎťL, respectively, are

ÎťU = lim
u(cid:37)1
ÎťL = lim
u(cid:38)0

(u) | X1 > F â1
(u) | X1 â¤ F â1
provided that limits ÎťU , ÎťL â [0, 1] exist.
If Îť(Âˇ) âĽ 0, X1 and X2 are said to be
asymptotically dependent (in the corresponding tail). If Îť(Âˇ) = 0, X1 and X2 are said
to be asymptotically independent (in the corresponding tail).

(A.5)

(A.4)

X1

X1

According to deďŹnition A.2, extreme realizations of two asymptotically tail-dependent
random variables tend to occur simultaneously. By the same token, asymptotical inde-
pendence in the tails means that, regardless of whether two random variables are linearly
correlated or not, extreme realizations occur independently for each variable.

Often, using copulas to construct multivariate models with desirable dependence prop-
erties is more convenient than specifying cdfs. It is especially true if a copula, but not
the corresponding cdf, can be expressed in the form of a simple formula. Copulas of one
special class â Archimedean copulas â have particulary simple analytical representation
in terms of what is known as a generating function, denoted Ď, and the general inverse of
the generating function, denoted Ďâ1:

C(u1, . . . , uN ) = Ďâ1(cid:0)Ď(u1) + ÂˇÂˇÂˇ + Ď(uN )(cid:1).

(A.6)

To give rise to a proper Archimedean copula, a generating function must satisfy certain
criteria, as described in Nelsen (1999, p. 90, p. 122) and Joe (1997, p. 373 f.).57

Archimedean copulas have a number of appealing features that make them popular
in ďŹnance and risk management. Their simple analytical representation facilitates their
use in high-dimensional portfolio models. These copulas are ďŹexible in capturing various
dependence structures, including tail dependence, which makes them suitable for modeling
extreme events. For a number of families of Archimedean copulas, eďŹcient sampling
algorithms have been developed, too.

At the same time, the permutation symmetry, stemming from the exchangeability of
the summands in Equation (A.6), constrains the practical applicability of Archimedean
copulas. The permutation symmetry means that the dependence among all components
is identical; all sub-copulas of the same dimension are equal. For those models, where
the exchangeability of the marginals poses too strong a restriction, a more general and
ďŹexible class of nested Archimedean copulas should be considered.

Nested Archimedean copulas are often called hierarchical Archimedean copulas, or
HACs. A HAC represents a hierarchical structure of sub-copulas, where diďŹerent sub-
copulas may be deďŹned for separate groups of marginals. For instance, a copula with ďŹve
57The inverse of the generator function must be (at least) N -monotone on the interval [0,â). This
is why Laplace transforms of positive random variables, being completely monotone functions, are often
applied to construct Archimedean copulas.

arguments and a structure of sub-copulas schematically represented as (((1, 2), 3), (4, 5))
takes the following form:

(A.7)
This is a partially nested HAC with three sub-copulas: one sub-copula is a fully nested
HAC that joins arguments 1, 2 and 3; other two sub-copulas are the regular two-dimensional
Archimedean copulas that join 1 with 2 and 4 with 5, respectively.

A HAC can adopt arbitrarily elaborate structures. It may be either fully or partially
nested. The generator functions within a HAC can come either from diďŹerent generator
families or from just a single generator family with diďŹerent parameters for its sub-copulas.
In this paper, we construct a HAC making use of the generator function of the Gumbel
family of Archimedean copulas.

In what follows we consider, without loss of generality, the two-dimensional Gumbel
copula. This copula exhibits asymmetric dependence structure by putting more proba-
bility mass on the upper tail. Its generating function is given by Ď(u) = (â ln(u))Î¸ and
the bivariate copula function reads

(cid:110)â(cid:0)[â ln(u1)]Î¸ + [â ln(u2)]Î¸(cid:1)1/Î¸(cid:111)

C Gu

Î¸

(u1, u2) = exp

(A.8)
Parameter 1 â¤ Î¸ < â controls the degree of dependence between two random variables.
For Î¸ = 1 the variables are independent; they become perfectly dependent as Î¸ grows
large. For any Î¸ > 1, the random variables joined by a Gumbel copula are positively
associated and asymptotically dependent in the upper tail. For a Gumbel copula, the
population versions of Kendallâs tau is given by Ď Gu = (Î¸ â 1)/Î¸ and the coeďŹcient of
U = 2 â 21/Î¸. The lower tail dependence coeďŹcient
upper tail dependence is given by ÎťGu
is zero.

.

As to the copula estimation, the âHAC packageâ in R programming environment
documented in Okhrin and Ristig (2012) provides a multi-stage MLE procedure, which
simultaneously determines the parameter and the structure of a HAC. The algorithm
endows the estimator with the usual asymptotic properties and is less computationally
intensive than a regular one-step MLE. It can be summarized as follows: Consider M
random variables. For all possible pairs of these variables, parameters Î¸ of bivariate
Gumbel copulas are estimated using regular MLE. The pair with the strongest dependence
(the largest Î¸) is then combined by its estimated copula to a new pseudo variable â the
ďŹrst node in the copula hierarchy. The program reiterates the whole procedure until all
Mâ1 parameters of bivariate copula nodes are estimated. To allow for more sophisticated
structures, the variables of two successive nodes are aggregated if the diďŹerence between
corresponding parameters Î¸ is smaller than a ďŹxed small threshold which we set to 0.5.
This allows for marginal copulas with more than two arguments. The chosen value of 0.5
makes it possible to neglect small diďŹerences in the strength of dependence, preserving
a reasonably granular copula structure. For further information on the methods and
challenges of estimating Archimedean copulas in high dimensions, we refer the reader to
Hofert, MÂ¨achler, and McNeil (2013).

A.3 Details on approximation of EADs, LGDs and PDs

If a bank has more than one credit exposures to a particular borrower, the EAD equals the
total exposure to this borrower. The on-balance sheet exposure is taken at its book value.
By contrast, lenders convert their oďŹ-balance sheet exposure stemming from derivatives
into credit equivalents using appropriate credit conversion factors. They report other
oďŹ-balance sheet credit exposure such as âguarantees extendedâ at its book value.

To compute LGD, we take into account the following information about credit risk
mitigation techniques: (i) collateral posted by the borrower and (ii) guarantees provided
by other banks. For the secured (overcollateralized) part of the exposure we assign the
LGD of 35%. For the remaining unsecured part we ďŹx the LGD at 45% (see sections 287
and 295 in BCBS, 2006). As for the guarantees, we scale down the LGD for that part
of the exposure for which a guarantee is available by the ratio of the guarantorâs PD to
the borrowerâs PD. Ideally, simulation of a double default, i.e. a possible default of the
guarantor given the default of the borrower, should be performed. But this is diďŹcult
to implement because no estimates for the probability of joint default of the borrower-
guarantor pairs are available. Thus, we only model the borrowersâs default, but scale
down the corresponding LGD to account for the risk mitigation technique (see sections
306-307 in BCBS, 2006). We assume that the expected loss from a direct credit exposure
to the guarantor (g) should be equal to the expected loss from the secured exposure to
the borrower (b): LGDg Âˇ P Dg = LGDb Âˇ P Db. Then, we compute the adjusted LGD
as LGDb = LGDg Âˇ P Dg/P Db, with LGDg = 45% if P Dg < P Db. If, on the contrary,
P Dg > P Db, we do not consider the guarantee at all (see section 301 in BCBS, 2006). If
an exposure is backed by more than one guarantor, the median guarantorsâ PD is taken.
For the credit exposures backed by both collateral and a guarantee, we take both into
account subject to the LGD ďŹoor of 0%.

The PDs are taken as reported by the lenders. They originate from the lendersâ
internal rating systems. For a given rating system, the PDs of two borrowers only diďŹer
from each other if the borrowers belong to diďŹerent rating categories. For all PDs we
impose a ďŹoor of 0.03% in accordance with section 285 BCBS (2006) and a ceiling of 30%.
A few reported PDs that exceed this ceiling are set to 100%, which means a sure default of
the borrower. The same borrowers may be rated diďŹerently by diďŹerent banks. Therefore,
if multiple PDs are available for the same borrower, we take the maximum value. For
borrowers for which no estimates of PDs are available at all, we take the median PD of all
borrowers belonging to the same group (sector/country/region). As an exception, missing
PDs for banks are set to the median PD for the banking sector across all countries.

Note: On the x-axis: simulated portfolio loss as a percentage of portfolio exposure. The baseline example
is given for 2015Q1. The example under the oil crisis scenario is given for 2017Q1, when the systemsâ
loss reaches its maximum for this stress scenario. Source: National Instituteâs Global Econometric Model

Note: In the unconditional simulation, expected loss (EL) and expected shortfall (ES) for the systemâs
credit portfolio (the aggregated portfolio of the 12 banks under consideration) are represented by black
dots. For the simulations based on NPL ratio scenarios, the box plots show the distribution of the
portfolio EL and ES over the time period for which the scenarios are available. Source: National Insti-
