Introduction
Processing instruction (PI) is an approach to teach the form
of language based on learners' input-processing strategies
(VanPatten & Cadierno, 1993). It is composed of an explicit
part based on a default input-processing problem and an
inductive, implicit task-based part in the form of structured
input tasks. VanPatten and other researchers have shown the
effectiveness of this intervention type in various studies with
respect to teaching the structure and grammatical morphol-
ogy of language (e.g., Farley, 2005; VanPatten, 1996;
VanPatten & Uludag, 2011). But its effectiveness concerning
other language forms has not been sufficiently established
yet as VanPatten and Uludag (2011) have put it themselves.
The main focus of this study was to investigate the utility
and effectiveness of PI (VanPatten, 1993), which is mainly
implemented through structured input tasks as opposed to
traditional exercise-/item-based intervention, but this time in
teaching English derivational affixes. There are both a quali-
tative and a quantitative part to this study. The students were
interviewed to survey their attitudes toward learning under
any of the instruction types investigated in this study. They
were also pretested, there was a comparison group, and the
groups were posttested under controlled conditions.
Background
Different aspects of PI have been investigated and discussed
in various contexts and by various researchers (e.g., Benati
& Lee, 2008; DeKeyser & Sokalski, 1996; Henry, Culmn, &
VanPatten, 2009; Lee, Leeser, & Wong, 2011; Sanz &
Morgan-Short, 2004; Uludag & VanPatten, 2012; VanPatten,
2004a; VanPatten & Borst, 2012; VanPatten, Farmer, &
Clardy, 2009; VanPatten, Inclezan, Salazar, & Farley, 2009;
VanPatten & Sanz, 1995; Wong, 2005), but the present study
was mainly inspired by VanPatten and Uludag's (2011)
research on the transferability of training via PI to output
tasks. In their study, they worked on the passive structure to
see whether input practice via PI, which is "an input oriented
approach to grammar intervention" (p. 44), is transferable to
limited output conditions. They carried out a detailed
statistical analysis of the data to interpret the results and

The Impact of Processing Instruction on
the Recognition and Production of English
Derivational Affixes Among EFL Learners
Sasan Baleghizadeh1 and Arash Saharkhiz1
Abstract
In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of processing instruction (PI) as opposed to traditional deductive exercise-
based intervention (TI) in teaching English derivational affixes. There was also a comparison non-intervention (NI) group,
and the groups were posttested. To teach the target affixes via PI, new structured input tasks were developed. In all, 101
adult male and female lower-intermediate participants initially took part in the study, but this was later reduced to 71 as
a result of the pretest, and so on. The results were analyzed through MANOVA and paired t test. In recognition, PI and
TI outperformed non-intervention, while PI and TI did not outperform one another. In production, TI outperformed the
other groups, while the other groups did not outperform one another. More studies must be carried out before drawing
any conclusions about the transferability of PI to output activities for teaching derivational affixes. The students were also
interviewed to survey their attitudes. Affectively, PI created self-confidence and an enjoyable atmosphere among the learners.
Also cognitively, PI was the only group that satisfied the participants in their ability to recognize and produce derivational
affixes. We found PI a highly effective and positive approach for teaching recognizing derivational affixes. We also believe it
to possess a high potential for teaching their production, as it gave the participants a good sense of self-confidence for the
production of the affixes.

proved the transferability of instruction via PI to output
activities.
The sufficiency of input for grammatical acquisition has
been supported by many (Benati, 2005; Benati & Lee, 2008;
Fernández, 2008; Truscott & Sharwood Smith, 2004;
VanPatten, 2002a), while others emphasize the pivotal role
of output in learning (Izumi, 2002; Swain, 1998). One of the
classical studies supporting the sufficiency of input is
VanPatten and Cadierno's (1993) experimental work on PI in
which the group receiving PI outperformed the group receiv-
ing no instruction and the one working on controlled to free
communicative activities. However, there have been some
studies that have denied this effectiveness for PI (DeKeyser,
Salaberry, Robinson, & Harrington, 2002; Keating & Farley,
2008; Qin, 2008). Many studies have compared input pro-
cessing with production-based intervention and proven either
the superiority of the latter or the equality of the effective-
ness of both (Collentine, 1998; DeKeyser & Sokalski, 1996;
Kim, 2001; Salaberry, 1997).
This study was supposed to investigate the effectiveness
of VanPatten's (1993) PI with regard to teaching English
morphemes, and more specifically its derivational mor-
phemes. As mentioned above, many studies have shown the
effectiveness of this intervention type with respect to teach-
ing the structure and grammatical morphology of language
(e.g., Benati, 2001), but its effectiveness concerning other
language forms has not been sufficiently established yet as
VanPatten and Uludag (2011) have put it themselves:
PI has been researched in English, Spanish, German, French,
Italian, and Russian to date. Within these languages, researchers
have examined both syntactic issues (word order and the role of
nouns in sentences, including case marking, and causative
structures), verbal morphology (e.g., past, present, future, mood,
aspect, person-number), nominally oriented morphology (e.g.,
agreement between nouns, adjectives, and participles), and other
surface forms of language. (p. 52)
As can be understood from the excerpt and a review of the
literature, there have been no efforts to examine the effec-
tiveness of this intervention with content words or deriva-
tional affixes (unlike inflectional affixes, which are functional
rather than lexical). Nor have there been any claims about
this effectiveness. Maybe this is due to the principles of input
processing proposed by VanPatten (2002b) such as the one
that reads "[l]earners prefer processing `more meaningful'
morphology before `less' or `nonmeaningful' morphology"
(p. 758, in the table). PI, therefore, tries to help learners over-
come their processing problems (i.e., their less-than-optimal
processing strategies) and process the ignored items more
readily.
A processing problem refers to a mistake students "make
when trying to comprehend a particular kind of sentence and
then [they] are given examples to show why their `default'
processing strategies may not work" (VanPatten & Uludag,
2011, p. 45). Actually during this explicit part of the instruc-
tion, learners are provided with information on why they
process a structure/item incorrectly as a result of a default
way of processing sentences and are taught how to overcome
this problem. The processing problem discerned with regard
to derivational affixes among elementary, lower-intermedi-
ate, and intermediate learners is that unless they are made
aware of the existence of a specific derivational affix in a
new word, particularly the less frequent derivational affixes,
they do not tend to notice it (Nation, 2001). In other words,
learners generally tend to perceive words holistically, unless
they are sensitized to derivational affixes during the later
stages of their learning lives through different noticing activ-
ities. This is based on VanPatten's (2004b) most basic input-
processing principle, that is, Principle 1, which reads "[l]
earners process input for meaning before they process it for
form" (p. 7, emphasis in original). In this regard, the first,
second, and fifth subprinciples are of particular importance.
They read as follows:
Principle 1a. The Primacy of Content Words Principle.
Learners process content words in the input before anything
else.
Principle 1b. The Lexical Preference Principle. Learne[r]s
will tend to rely on lexical items as opposed to grammatical form
to get meaning when both encode the same semantic information.
Principle [1]e. The Availability of Resources Principle. For
learners to process either redundant meaningful grammatical
forms or non-meaningful forms, the processing of overall
sentential meaning must not drain available processing
resources. (VanPatten, 2004b, p. 14, emphasis in original)
Learners generally tend to rely on the contextual clues
and the lexical items available to process meaning.
Structured input activities "contain input manipulated in
particular ways to push learners away from less-than-opti-
mal processing strategies" (VanPatten & Uludag, 2011, p.
45, emphasis in original). They are asked to interpret sen-
tences containing the target structure/item and this leads to
altering their default processing strategies. More has been
explained about structured input under the treatments
section.
What was probed to be done in this study was to investi-
gate this rather untouched aspect of PI. The question was
whether PI could be effective in teaching the derivational
affixes in language or it would lose ground to other tradi-
tional, time-honored approaches (VanPatten, 1993, 1996,
2002b; VanPatten & Uludag, 2011).
Besides this comparison, the present research was des-
tined to develop a specific structured input task catering to
the instruction of English derivational affixes. As the major-
ity of the studies carried out on PI so far have examined
grammar intervention, most of the structured input tasks
Baleghizadeh and Saharkhiz 3
designed cater to teaching the structure of language and there
are almost no well-developed tasks focusing on derivational
affixes, at least to the present researchers' best knowledge.
Therefore, an effective task of our own was needed to be
designed for the specific purpose of this study.
Based on the problems and purposes stated for this
research work, the following four categories of questions
emerged:
Intervention Versus Non-Intervention
Research Question 1: Will intervention make any statis-
tically significant difference in the recognition of deriva-
tional affixes?
Research Question 2: Will intervention make any statis-
tically significant difference in the production of deriva-
tional affixes?
PI Versus TI
Research Question 3: Will there be any statistically sig-
nificant difference between the effect of intervention
through PI on the recognition of derivational affixes and
that of intervention through TI?
Research Question 4: Will there be any statistically sig-
nificant difference between the effect of intervention
through PI on the production of derivational affixes and
that of intervention through TI?
PI
Research Question 5:As a corollary of Question 4 and as
PI is an input-based intervention, will PI lead to the trans-
fer of training from input to output with regard to deriva-
tional affixes?
Research Question 6:As a corollary of Question 4 and as
PI has been the main focus of this study, will PI after all
be effective in teaching the derivational affixes of
language?
Research Question 7: Will the structured input task cre-
ated for instructing derivational affixes in this study lead
learners to alter their "less-than-optimal processing strat-
egies" (VanPatten & Uludag, 2011, p. 45, emphasis in
original)? How will the task work in actual practice? Will
it turn out to work well?
Qualitative Investigations
Research Question 8: What different patterns can be found
among the attitudes the participants bear toward various
aspects of learning under any of these instruction types?
Method
This study was planned to compare the differing effects of
three instruction types on students' acquisition and use
patterns of English derivational affixes both quantitatively
and qualitatively. The purpose of the qualitative analysis was
to gain more information than the mere numerical informa-
tion on various instructions would provide.
Participants and Categories
The participants were chosen from among adult foreign lan-
guage learners of both genders with age ranging from 18 to
25, with just a limited number of exceptions of age about 30
and 40. All the participants were BA/BS students of busi-
ness, management, physics, mathematics, education, and the
like at the Shahre Rey Branch of Islamic Azad University in
Tehran. All the students were attending their General English
course and one of the present researchers was their instruc-
tor. As all the participants were students of majors other than
the English Language (Literature, Translation, or Teaching
English as a foreign language [TEFL]), all of them were sup-
posed to be lower-intermediate learners, and this was con-
firmed through devising the reading section of the paper
version of Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)®.
Three instruction types for teaching English derivational
affixes were examined. Two of these were the treatment
groups including a PI intervention based on VanPatten's
(1993) PI theory and a deductive item-based intervention
(hereafter the TI group [traditional intervention]), and the
other one was an inductive, holistic non-intervention (hereaf-
ter the NI group [non-intervention]), which served as the
comparison group. Due to the common limitations at univer-
sities, the three classes chosen were intact, but the three
instruction types were assigned randomly to each of the three
classes. The groups initially consisted of 38, 29, and 34 par-
ticipants, in the PI, TI, and NI groups, respectively. However,
for reasons that have been explained in what follows, these
numbers were later reduced to 23, 23, and 25, respectively.
Morphemes
Rather than inflectional affixes, this study chose to examine
the effectiveness of PI with teaching derivational mor-
phemes, which have more to do with the meanings of words.
Based on the definition proposed for derivational morphemes
in Nation (2001) and in Hudson (2000), they are bound mor-
phemes (i.e., affixes, either prefixes or suffixes) that change
either the meaning of a word or its part of speech. For exam-
ple, the affix un- in unhappy is a derivational prefix that
changes word meanings and the affix -ness in happiness is a
derivational suffix that transforms an adjective into a noun. A
sample of all types of derivational affixes was selected in this
study. The selection was founded on a categorization and
sequencing of English derivational affixes for instruction
based on the difficulty criterion by Nation. He has listed the
affixes under five stages from the easiest ones to the most
difficult (see Table 1).
As it shows, the third stage which stands in the middle and
suits intermediate learners includes the longest list. This list
4 SAGE Open
seemed to give the greater number of items to choose from,
but as some of the learners in the present study might have
been familiar with some of them, it was wiser to pick the
affixes in the last two stages to make sure that they were
unfamiliar. Nevertheless, any final claims about the familiar-
ity of the learners with the selected items had to be based on
the pretesting results. There were 28 affixes in the last two
stages, and to round the number of the affixes for our treat-
ments and tests, we added two other rather infrequent affixes
from the third stage: -en (adjective- and verb-maker) and
semi-. Besides, two of the affixes selected (ex- and pro-)
were actually two affixes each that had the same form but
different meanings and functions. We did so to have more
example words for them at our disposal.
Pretesting
For each of the affixes, a recognition multiple-choice item
was designed. The stem presented a sentence including an
underlined word containing the affix. The options repre-
sented different meaning alternatives for the word and they
were similar to each other except for the part related to the
affix. Below, the reader is provided with two example
items--one for testing a derivational suffix and one for a
derivational prefix:
Example:
The depth of the hole made it difficult to be seen.
1. making something deep
2. how deep something is
3. someone who makes things deep
A co-pilot has a really difficult job.
1. a pilot in the past
2. an amateur pilot
3. someone who helps the pilot
In the end, all the items were collected into a whole test
and validated.
As the cut-off point, it was decided that, to account for the
guessing scores, the students who gained any score amount-
ing to more than 25% of the total score (to be on the safe
side) be excluded. Accordingly, as a whole, 15 of the partici-
pants who had gained 8 and more were excluded and, quite
by chance 5 in each group. In addition, a number of the par-
ticipants who were present on the pretest were absent either
during the treatments or on the posttest. Therefore, 15 more
pretest scores were excluded: 10 in PI, 1 in TI, and 4 in NI.
Thus, 71 participants were left for the final posttest: 23, 23,
and 25 in PI, TI, and NI, respectively.
Any item with an item facility index of more than 0.25
(more than 17 correct answers) was omitted, because the
affixes tested by such items would be conceived of as too
familiar for the learners. Four of the items were consequently
deleted: Item 1 testing the affix -able with 33 correct answers,
Item 2 testing -ee with 24, Item 10 testing -y with 27, and
Item 11 testing pre- with 22. So, the total score of the pretest
was changed to 26 from 30. These affixes were also deleted
from the treatments and posttest.
A one-way ANOVA showed no significant difference
among the groups in their prior knowledge of the target mor-
phemes: F(2, 68) = 0.12, p > .891.
Treatments
Three 30-min treatment sessions were allocated to each
group. All the sessions were taught by one of the researchers,
and they were all held in L2.
In NI, the students read passages including the affixes
silently. The texts were about miscellaneous topics, includ-
ing sports, navy, and science. Afterward, they were asked
some general and specific comprehension questions by the
teacher and, next, they had reading aloud accompanied by

the clarification of the vocabulary and difficult sentences. All
the new words were defined and further sentential examples
were provided by the teacher to show their uses in sentences.
In the end, they worked on a vocabulary activity in which
they received a list of words to complete sentences including
a blank. There was no indication to affixes during any of the
phases of their instruction (see Appendix A for the NI sample
material).
In TI, in each session the students were given explicit
morphological explanations on the target affixes, followed
by traditional exercises which the students answered in pairs.
From the second session on, before presenting the rest of the
target affixes, the teacher answered the students' problems
with the previous ones and they reviewed them together.
There were two kinds of exercises in this group. In the first
one, the students added an affix to a stem/word to form a
complete word based on the part of speech and a definition in
front of each word. In the second exercise, they were pre-
sented with sentences including a blank and a word which
was provided in the end of each sentence in parentheses. The
students added an appropriate affix to the word to fill in the
blank (see Appendix B for the TI sample material).
In PI, in the first session, the students received explicit
instruction with examples on the target affixes and a process-
ing problem accompanied by structured input activities. In
the structured input activities, they were not asked to pro-
duce the target affixes and did not receive any further explicit
explanation (VanPatten & Uludag, 2011). During the next
sessions, the students only worked on more structured input
activities.
In this study, the PI learners were presented with a version
of structured input activities which was specifically designed
for the presentation of derivational affixes, because there has
been no structured input task with such an aim developed in
the literature, at least to the present researchers' best knowl-
edge. The tasks included 15, 30, and 30 items for the three
sessions, respectively, to cover the 30 min of instruction in
each session. Each item presented them with a L1 sentence
or a picture for which there were two English sentences to
choose between (VanPatten & Cadierno, 1993; Wong, 2004).
In two thirds of the items in each activity, the sentences
including the affixes were the correct answers and in the rest
of the items the sentences not including them (see Appendix
C for the PI sample material).
Posttest and Analyses
Immediately after the treatments were over, the posttest was
given to the participants on the last session of the instruc-
tions. There was a 3-week gap between the pretest and the
posttest, which would neutralize almost any practice effect.
The posttest included two sections: a recognition test and a
production test. The recognition posttest was of the same for-
mat as that of the pretest, but new items were developed.
The production test included completion items in which
the participants were presented with a cue word in the end of
each sentence in parentheses. The students were supposed to
add an appropriate affix to the cue word to fill in the blank.
Below, the reader is provided with an example item:
Example:
The two students ------ to answer the questions. (operate)
In the end, all the items were collected into a whole test
and validated.
There were one independent variable and two dependent
variables in the study. The independent variable was instruc-
tion type with the three levels of PI, TI, and NI. The two
dependent variables investigated in this study were the par-
ticipants' recognition and production scores.
The data in this design were analyzed using one-way
MANOVA to find out whether there was a significant overall
difference and Tukey's post hoc test to compare each two
means on each dependent variable.Also, separate t tests were
run between the pretest and the recognition posttest results of
each of the three groups to check for the amount of gain in
their recognition of the target affixes.
Qualitative Investigations
The qualitative part of this study contributed to the quantita-
tive part by collecting non-numerical data on the partici-
pants' attitudes toward the effectiveness of different
instruction types for the acquisition of English derivational
affixes. Scrutinizing this effectiveness does not necessarily
need to be done merely through experimenting with those
instructions. The participants' attitudes can be valid sources
of information on the effectiveness of the instructions they
undergo.
What was interesting for the researchers to find out was to
detect whether studying derivational affixes under PI gave
the learners a cognitively and affectively more positive expe-
rience than did studying under other more traditional inter-
ventions. To this aim, a structured interview was developed
that tapped their views toward various aspects of their class-
rooms. A complete version of the structured interview is pre-
sented in Table 2 below.
The interviews were carried out in the learners' L1 to
ensure maximum understanding and feedback. The inter-
view was piloted with intermediate adult learners prior to the
study, and it was made sure that it would elicit the informa-
tion we were looking for, hence the validity of the items.
Results and Discussion
A one-way MANOVA was run for the posttest, and a signifi-
cant difference was found in the results: F(4, 134) = 5.81,
p < .0005. This shows that different instruction types did
have an effect on the learners' recognition and/or production
of the target affixes. However, a partial 2 of .15 suggests
that only 15% of the difference found was due to the inde-
pendent variable, that is, the instruction types, and the
6 SAGE Open
remaining 85% was due to other intervening variables. Also,
the tests of between-subjects effects show that this difference
has been significant in both recognition and production:
Frecognition
(2, 68) = 6.2, p < .003, partial 2 = .15, and
Fproduction
(2,68) = 5.76, p < .005, partial 2 = .15. Afterward, a
Tukey's post hoc test was run to compare each two means on
each dependent variable (see Table 3).
The results of Tukey's post hoc test illustrate that both
treatment groups, that is, PI and TI, significantly outper-
formed the comparison group, that is, NI on the recognition
posttest, while no significant difference was found between
PI and TI on this test. This can mean that intervention, as
opposed to non-intervention, can make a positive difference
for teaching recognizing derivational affixes, but there is no
considerable difference between the traditional deductive
item-based approach and more modern task-based
approaches. Thus, teaching derivational affixes, regardless
of the approach taken, leads to higher amounts of learning
than does not teaching them. In other words, we can feel safe
that if teachers spend time on teaching the affixes through
more direct instructional procedures, they will not be wast-
ing that time to gain nothing considerable in return. If teach-
ers do not probe to teach derivational affixes directly, their
learners will most probably gain much less than when they
do so directly. However, all these should be taken with
caution.
In terms of production, TI significantly outperformed the
other two groups, while neither PI nor NI proved any better
than one another. This may signify that as PI is an input-
based approach, it cannot bear any better results than not
teaching using derivational affixes in speaking and writing
at all (i.e., non-intervention). It seems that the more tradi-
tional deductive practice-based approaches work better for
teaching the production of derivational affixes. This actually
connotes the lack of transferability of PI to output activities
at least in terms of derivational affixes. Of course, there have
been many studies that have supported the transferability of
PI to output tasks (Benati, 2005; Benati & Lee, 2008;
Fernández, 2008), and this study does not deny this transfer-
ability for other aspects of SLA. Even with respect to teach-
ing derivational affixes, we believe that as this was one of the
first times that PI was devised for the instruction of deriva-
tional affixes, there must have been definitely many short-
ages and deficiencies in the proper implementation and
actualization of PI based on the principles established for it
in the literature. These may have included factors such as the
length of instruction and the development of well-targeted
material.
However, one highly important point should not be over-
looked. Not leading to any better results than the non-inter-
vention instruction in the production of derivational affixes
may connote, but does not necessarily denote, the lack of
transferability of PI to output activities. Besides, the obser-
vation that PI was significantly less effective than TI in
teaching the production of derivational affixes does not mean
that PI itself has not been significantly effective in teaching
the production of derivational affixes. In sum, to make sure
whether PI is after all transferable to output activities or not,
a production pretest­posttest design needs to be put up,
which has, to our great regret, been one of the limitations of
this study.
In addition, the significant impact of PI on the recognition
of derivational affixes should not be forgotten. After all, this
was one of the first times PI was devised for their instruction
and it turned out to be considerably successful and even a bit
more so than the traditional deductive item-based approach.
This can be deeply promising for the advocates of PI. PI has
been successful in a domain for which it has never made big
claims--that is, the instruction of derivational affixes.
As mentioned above, in this study, we also drew a recog-
nition within-groups pretest­posttest comparison. The aim
was to find out which group(s) had significantly improved
from the pretest to the posttest. Separate t tests were run
between the pretest and the recognition posttest results of
each of the three groups. The results of these analyses plus
the descriptive statistics of the groups on all their tests have
been tabulated in Table 4 below.
According to Table 4, all the three groups significantly
improved since their pretest. This means that all the instruc-
tion types were effective for teaching recognizing the deriva-
tional affixes. Even the comparison group, which had not
received any instruction on the target affixes, managed to
make significant progress. This may seem disappointing for
the results obtained by PI on the recognition posttest, but
before jumping into any conclusion we should take a second
look at Table 3. Based on Table 3, PI significantly

outperformed NI on the recognition posttest and this means
that it has been better enough to be considered as an alterna-
tive for non-intervention in teaching derivational affixes.
The same is true for TI. Although PI was slightly better than
TI on the recognition posttest, it did not succeed to cause a
significant difference. Again this can be attributed to the use
of PI for teaching derivational affixes for almost the first
time in this study. Deductive item-based instruction of deri-
vational affixes has been devised for many years in schools
and institutes, but it has always received students' frowns
because of the lack of attractiveness of its procedure. Maybe
it is time to substitute this rather dull approach with more
attractive activities that have proved effective in this respect,
especially PI, which is more likely to be welcomed by stu-
dents due to its use of illustrations, as you will read in the
following section.
So far, the first six research questions have been dis-
cussed.As for the seventh question about the structured input
tasks created for instructing derivational affixes in this study,
we cannot have an outright answer. We do not exactly know
whether the learning brought about by PI in recognition was
due to the initial explicit part or the subsequent structured
input tasks. What is undeniable, however, is their attractive-
ness and novelty for the participants as described in the fol-
lowing section. Therefore, even not to mention their direct
role, they can at least indirectly have a positive effect on stu-
dents' learning. As you will read in the qualitative part, the
students were deeply interested in the illustrations and the
general format of the activities in PI and invested more
energy and attention in their instruction. Nevertheless, to
have a better picture of how the structured input tasks influ-
ence the acquisition of derivational affixes more studies need
to be done focusing on this specific aspect of PI.
Surveying the Participants' Attitudes
As mentioned above, a structured interview was developed
which tapped the participants' views toward various aspects
of their classrooms. A complete version of the structured
interview is presented in Table 2. Each interview lasted for
about 5 min. To answer our eighth research question, the
interviews were analyzed almost based on Lynch's (1992)
model of analysis of "the effects matrix" through "general
patterns," "specific difference patterns," and "specific simi-
larity patterns." This method of analysis mixes both qualita-
tive and quantitative forms of data. The data are summarized
in a table in the form of a matrix and then evaluated both
qualitatively and numerically. We transcribed the learners'
answers to the questions in the interview and summarized
them in Table 5 below.
In each group, five of the participants were randomly cho-
sen for the interview. All the three aspects mentioned above
have been discussed in what follows.
General Patterns
A general comparison among the three groups of the inter-
viewees' answers to the questions shows that the PI group
received 23 pluses, the TI group 18, and the NI group 23.
However, PI received 6 minuses, TI 11, and NI 7. This gen-
eral comparison favors the PI and NI groups as opposed to
the TI group. Generally, the learners in the traditional deduc-
tive item-based approach were not as positive about both the
affective and cognitive aspects of the instruction of deriva-
tional affixes as those in PI and NI.
Specific Difference Patterns
Regarding the class atmosphere, the participants in PI had a
rather highly positive attitude toward their instruction. The
important point is that there was no negative attitude at all.
Only one of the interviewees gave a neutral response. The TI
interviewees were a bit negative. On average, their attitude
was not terrible, but TI was not very welcomed either. In NI,
the participants seemed to like their instruction in general,
but three of the interviewees did not sound that enthusiastic.
It was very interesting that the learners who had not
received any instruction in terms of the affixes claimed to
have gained the highest amount of self-confidence, and all of
them agreed in that respect. In the PI group, all the learners

but one enjoyed a high level of confidence in understanding
and using the affixes. The TI interviewees seemed to be at a
bit lower confidence level in comparison with the other two
groups.
Recognition turned out to be PI's strongest aspect. All the
PI interviewees agreed on having improved considerably in
recognizing the affixes in texts. TI's average in this respect
was a bit low, and NI, though better than TI, was not as posi-
tive as PI.
To our great surprise, TI had the lowest average in pro-
duction, too. Most of the TI interviewees were negative
about their ability to use the affixes for producing words
including them. The NI participants were just a little better.
The PI interviewees were largely positive about their produc-
tion abilities, and two of them thought that in case of more
practice and review at home they would gain more fruitful
results in future.
For two of the PI participants, the pictures were the sweet
part of the instruction and one of them felt that he had gained
more information about the English language. Only one of
the interviewees in TI liked the change, and one in NI found
the information useful for her final exam at the university.
One interviewee in each of the TI and NI groups thought
that the instructions were over their heads, while two inter-
viewees in the PI group asked for more instruction and pic-
tures--a criticism that is only negative on the surface.
Specific Similarity Patterns
There were some similarities among the three groups in each
of the questions, but here, we focus on just some of the most
important aspects. In terms of the affective aspects, both PI
and NI enjoyed warm receptions from the interviewees, but
PI won the ground with regard to the cognitive aspect from
the other groups. All the three groups had gained consider-
able amounts of self-confidence about learning and using
derivational affixes after the instructions were over, and this
shows that generally language learners welcome instruction

of derivational affixes. Also, no parts of any of the instruc-
tion types turned out to have severely bothered the learners.
Summary
Generally speaking, PI seemed to be the most popular of the
three instruction types with the participants. Affectively, the
learners enjoyed their experience with the procedure and
gained high levels of self-confidence. Particularly, they were
very positive about the illustrations. Actually, NI, too, was
successful in this respect but not as successful. This partial
accomplishment, we speculate, is because of the inductive
nature of NI, which does not make learners overly tired. TI,
due to its deductive, tedious procedure, looked a bit boring to
the learners.
Also cognitively, although this was TI that had gained the
best results on the recognition and production posttests as a
whole, PI was the only group that accomplished to satisfy the
participants in terms of their ability to recognize and produce
derivational affixes. They felt that they had become much
better after the instruction. This was not the case with either
TI or NI. Therefore, we think that PI can be deeply promising
for teaching derivational affixes. It is an approach highly
welcomed by learners because of its novelty, and this popu-
larity among its recipients is a point that not many instruction
types have enjoyed.
Conclusion
In this study, we tried to investigate the utility and effective-
ness of PI (VanPatten, 1993), which is mainly implemented
through structured input tasks in teaching English deriva-
tional affixes as opposed to traditional deductive exercise-
based intervention.
Statistically, PI proved quite effective for the recogni-
tion of derivational affixes, but for any claim about the
transferability of PI to output activities for teaching deri-
vational affixes, more meticulous studies must be carried
out.
Considering the participants' attitudes, PI, and with a
lower caliber NI, managed to create an enjoyable atmosphere
in the class and positive attitudes of self-confidence among
the learners.
Based on the results of both sections of the study, we find
PI a highly effective and positive approach for teaching the
recognition of derivational affixes. We also believe it to pos-
sess a high potential for teaching their production, as it gave
the participants a good sense of self-confidence for the pro-
duction of the affixes.
Dull traditional deductive practice-based approaches have
been exhausted for the instruction of derivational affixes,
and we believe that it is time for the substitution of this
approach with more popular and effective approaches,
including PI, with all their novelties and attractions. This was
what we actually probed to try in this study.
