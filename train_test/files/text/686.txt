PEER REVIEW
Did Medicaid Expansions For
Pregnant Women Crowd Out Private
Coverage?
One estimate finds only a small amount of trade-off ("crowding out")
between public and private insurance.
by Lisa Dubay and Genevieve Kenney
EDITOR'S NOTE: The question of whether ex-
pansions in Medicaid coverage lead to declines in pri-
vate insurance coverage ("crowding out") has emerged
in recentyears as an important issue in the healthpol-
icy community. Although it is generally agreed that
crowding out is a problem, there is widespread dis-
agreement regarding its extent. The Peer Review sec-
tion offers an opportunityfor healthpolicy leaders and
researchers to present differing interpretations of a
controversial issue. Here, Lisa Dubay and Genevieve
Kenney, and David Cutler and Jonathan Gruber, set
out opposing views on the impact of Medicaid expan-
sions on private coverage. Following that, Richard
Curtis and colleagues, then]ohn Holahan, comment on
the importance and the policy implications of the
authors'findings.
CONCERN ABOUT HIGH INFANT mortality
and morbidity in the United States and
the erosion of private insurance coverage
sparked major expansions in the Medicaid
program beginning in 1986. These expansions,
which were aimed at increasing prenatal and
other health services available to pregnant
women, were followed by large increases in
the number of Medicaid-eligible births and
declines in the number of births to uninsured
women.1 Nonetheless, recent research on the
national impact of these expansions suggests
that they had only a small effect on the timeli-
ness of prenatal care and the incidence of low-
birthweight births.2
A number of researchers have suggested
that the lack of improvement during the early
years of the expansions may have been the
result of demographic changes in the popula-
tion giving birth, continuing problems with
the Medicaid enrollment process, and access
problems that low-income pregnant women
faced.3 Two other factors that may help to ex-
plain the lack of strong effects serve as the
focus for this paper: the extent to which
Medicaid is reaching its target population,
and the extent to which Medicaid is substi-
tuting for employer-sponsored coverage.
Speculation on the latter issue has been
fueled partly by the fact that following the
expansions, growth in Medicaid-covered
births vastly outpaced the decline in un-in-
sured births, which indicates that there was a
reduction in private insurance coverage dur-
ing the expansion period. Indeed, some ob-
servers have argued that 50 to 100 percent of
the increase in Medicaid coverage for preg-
nant women was attributable to the "crowd-
ing out" of private insurance.4 Crowding out
is a phenomenon whereby more generous
Medicaid eligibility policies that are designed
to extend coverage to the uninsured may
prompt some privately insured persons to
drop their coverage to take advantage of the
expanded public subsidy. This can have two
major policy implications. First, the substitu-
tion of Medicaid for private coverage may lead

to fewer improvements in access to care and
health status than expected.5 Second, crowd-
ing out may lead to greater-than-expected in-
creases in Medicaid spending.
The Medicaid expansions took place at a
time of shrinking employer-sponsored cover-
age across the board.6 However, this fact alone
does not mean that the expansions caused
private coverage to decline. In fact, other ob-
servers have argued that the previous litera-
ture fails to adequately control for the secular
declines in employer-sponsored coverage that
were occurring over the period of analysis.7
Our goal here is to document the changing
picture of health insurance coverage for preg-
nant women in the four-year period following
the Medicaid expansions and to assess the ex-
tent to which crowding out may have influ-
enced trends. We attempt to build on the pre-
vious literature by identifying and analyzing
insurance coverage of pregnant women and
making an explicit attempt to account for
secular changes in employer-sponsored insur-
ance coverage over the period.8 A key contri-
bution of this paper is that it examines the
potential for crowding out at different eligi-
bility thresholds.
Data And Methods
For this analysis we used The Urban Insti-
tute's Transfer Income Model, Version 2
(TRIM2), a microsimulation model of tax and
transfer programs affecting individuals and
families.9 The database underlying TRIM2 is
the March Current Population Survey (CPS),
a nationally representative sample of the U.S.
population. For this analysis, we used the
1989 and 1993 versions of the March CPS.10
· Extent of crowding out. Here we sum-
marize the four steps used to estimate the ex-
tent of crowding out over the expansion pe-
riod.11 First, because we believe that the
potential for substitution of Medicaid for em-
ployer coverage varies dramatically by in-
come, we examined how the distribution of
insurance coverage of pregnant women
changed between 1988 and 1992 separately for
poor (family incomes up to 100 percent of
poverty) and near-poor (family incomes of
100-185 percent of poverty) pregnant
women.12 Second, we netted out the declines
in employer coverage for a group likely to be
unaffected by the expansions--men ages
eighteen to forty-four--by income group, to
explicitly control for the erosion of employer-
sponsored coverage occurring over the period
independent of the expansions. What re-
mains is the amount of the decline in
employer-sponsored coverage attributable to
crowding out for each income group. Third,
we divided the crowding-out effect by the in-
crease in Medicaid enrollment for pregnant
women to assess how much of the increase
resulted from crowding out, by income group.
Finally, we weighted our results by the per-
centage increase in the number of Medicaid-
enrolled pregnant women over the time
period in each income group.
· Caveats. Several problems with the CPS
data and limitations to our analysis should be
noted. First, estimates of the uninsured from
the CPS reflect the number of persons for
whom none of the specified types of coverage
is reported for the year (the default category).
Ideally, respondents would be asked whether
they had been uninsured for either part or all
of the past year. Thus, if survey respondents
are answering the questions as intended, the
only persons reported as uninsured on the
CPS are those without insurance for the en-
tire year.
Second, persons responding to the CPS
may be reporting their coverage status at the
time of the interview, rather than their status
during the previous calendar year, as re-
quested. The evidence suggests a mix of re-
sponses among CPS respondents. For this
analysis we assume that respondents are re-
porting coverage during the previous year.13
Third, participation in Medicaid and other
income-related programs is almost certainly
underreported because the number of persons
on the survey who report participation is
much lower than the number of program par-
ticipants. We use the TRIM2 edited version
of the CPS to address this concern.14

Fourth, a number of respondents reported
having had both Medicaid and employer cov-
erage over the past year. Women in this cate-
gory are likely a mix of those who retained
both Medicaid and employer-sponsored cov-
erage for some part of the year and those who
had Medicaid at some point during the year
and employer coverage at another point. It is
not clear how to interpret changes in the
status of such respondents. We assume that
half of them had only Medicaid coverage at a
point in time and that the other half had only
employer coverage. Therefore, counts of these
respondents are split evenly between those
who reported having had the two types of
coverage in each of the two years.
Fifth, pregnant women are not explicitly
identified on the CPS. We use an algorithm
developed for other Urban Institute projects
that identifies women who were pregnant in
the year prior to the March survey.15 However,
our approach underestimates the number of
pregnant women.16 Also, it does not allow us
to capture changes in insurance coverage that
may have occurred during the last one to three
months of pregnancy for those women whose
infants were born between January and
March of a given survey year.17
Sixth, the CPS data are cross-sectional. A
definitive analysis of the issue of crowding out
requires the use of a longitudinal database to
shed light on the dynamic nature of health
insurance coverage. Since the only other work
to date on this issue also uses the CPS, our
analysis provides additional context for as-
sessing those results.
Finally, we assume that changes in insur-
ance coverage of men ages eighteen to forty-
four are an appropriate control for what
would have happened to coverage of pregnant
women in the absence of the expansions. To
the extent that what happened for the com-
parison group is not a reasonable counter-
factual for pregnant women, our results may
be biased. If the secular declines in dependent
coverage are more significant than for individ-
ual coverage, we may be underestimating the
decline in employer-sponsored coverage that
would have been expected for pregnant
women independent of the expansions, since
pregnant women are more likely than men to
have dependent coverage. In fact, there is evi-
dence to suggest that this is the case: Between
1989 and 1993 employee health insurance con-
tributions rose by twice as much for family
coverage as for individual coverage.18 There-
fore, we believe that the likely bias in this
analysis is to overestimate the crowding-out
effect.
Results
In 1992, 33 percent of the pregnant women in
our sample reported having Medicaid cover-
age at some point during the year they were
pregnant, and 54 percent reported having
employer-sponsored coverage (Exhibit 1). Al-
most 8 percent of all pregnant women were
uninsured for all of 1992. The importance of
Medicaid coverage varied tremendously by in-
come group.
· To what extent is Medicaid covering the
target population? To determine the extent
to which the Medicaid expansions have
reached their target population, we calculated
Medicaid participation rates for all eligible
pregnant women. Two-thirds of all pregnant
women who were eligible for Medicaid cover-
age were actually enrolled. This varied by
Medicaid eligibility category. More than 90
percent of those women who were eligible
through Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) eligibility were enrolled in
Medicaid. Participation rates for the popula-
tion made eligible through the poverty-
related Medicaid expansions was lower, in
part but not entirely because of the greater
prevalence of employer-sponsored coverage
among these women. Women with employer
coverage who were eligible for Medicaid un-
der the poverty-related expansions enrolled in
Medicaid at a rate of 30 percent, while eligible
women without employer coverage enrolled
at a rate of 44 percent. Of those pregnant
women who remain uninsured, 41 percent
had family incomes below 100 percent of pov-
erty, and 30 percent had incomes of 100-185

percent of poverty. Moreover, 81 percent of
uninsured pregnant women were eligible for
Medicaid coverage.
· Did the Medicaid expansions crowd out
employer insurance? To determine the extent
of crowding out, we first examined changes in
insurance coverage for pregnant women by
income group and then compared the trends
for pregnant women to those of a comparison
group. Based on these differences, we esti-
mated the extent of crowding out that oc-
curred over the expansion period.
Changes in health insurance coveragefor thepoor,
1988-1992. For poor pregnant women (in-
comes below 100 percent of poverty), the
share with Medicaid coverage increased by
4.4 percentage points between 1988 and 1992
(from 74.3 percent to 78.7 percent). In addi-
tion, the share of poor pregnant women with
employer-sponsored coverage increased by
2.8 percentage points (from 6.5 percent to 9.3
percent). The share of poor pregnant women
who were uninsured fell by almost seven per-
centage points, from 16.6 percent to 9.7
percent--a much larger decline than for all
pregnant women, for whom the rate of unin-
surance fell by only three percentage points.19
These patterns suggest that the expan-
sions resulted in a decline in the number of
births to uninsured women living in poverty
and virtually no crowding out of employer in-
surance. Given the dramatic drop in the per-
centage of poor pregnant women without in-
surance, the expansions in Medicaid appear
to have provided a "safety net" for these
women. The lack of crowding out is likely
attributable in large part to the low level of
employer insurance coverage for households
at this income level.
Changes in insurance coverage for the near-poor,
1988-1992. Trends for near-poor pregnant
women (incomes of 100-185 percent of pov-
erty) were different. For these women, we ob-
served a large decline in employer coverage
and a commensurate increase in Medicaid
coverage between 1988 and 1992 (from 53.1
percent to 38.8 percent and from 21.8 percent
to 38.5 percent, respectively). There was vir-
tually no change in the share of women in this
income group who remained uninsured (from
15.9 percent to 16.2 percent), but near-poor
pregnant women were the most likely to be
uninsured among all income groups, at 15 per-
cent of all births in 1992.20
Although these trends are consistent with
the possibility of crowding out for the near-
poor, this evidence alone does not indicate
whether the changes observed were the result
of crowding out or were instead the result of
secular changes in the insurance market that

would have resulted in these women's being
uninsured in the absence of the expansions.
Changes in insurance coveragefor the comparison
group. To explore the reasons for the shift from
employer-sponsored to Medicaid coverage,
we compared the experience of pregnant
women with that of men ages eighteen to
forty-four, who would not have been affected
by the income-eligibility expansions. Given
the lack of evidence of crowding out for poor
pregnant women, we limit our comparison of
trends to the near-poor. For men in this cate-
gory, employer coverage dropped from 40.2
percent in 1988 to 33.4 percent in 1992. This
loss of private coverage was offset to some
extent by an increase of 2.2 percentage points
in Medicaid coverage between 1988 and 1992
(from 6.4 percent to 8.6 percent). However,
overall, the rate of uninsured men in this cate-
gory rose by 5.7 percentage points, from 40.1
percent in 1988 to 45.8 percent in 1992.21
Exhibit 2 presents changes in insurance
coverage for near-poor men and pregnant
women. The decline in employer-sponsored
coverage is much higher for pregnant women
than for men in this income range. Also, near-
poor pregnant women showed much larger
increases in Medicaid coverage than did their
male counterparts. Finally, near-poor preg-
nant women showed virtually no increase in
uninsurance, while it increased for men.
These results indicate that there was likely
some crowding out of employer-sponsored
coverage for near-poor pregnant women as a
result of the expansions. But the decline in
employer-sponsored coverage for men sug-
gests the possibility that some of the switch-
ing from employer coverage to Medicaid for
pregnant women was unrelated to the expan-
sions. If near-poor pregnant women had the

Extent of crowding out. How much of the in-
crease in Medicaid coverage can be attributed
to crowding out? From step three of our
crowding-out estimation procedure above,
we calculate that 45 percent of the increase in
Medicaid coverage for near-poor pregnant
women is the result of the crowding out of
employer-sponsored insurance.22
When we make separate estimates of the
extent of crowding out for near-poor preg-
nant women with incomes of 100-133 percent
of poverty and for those with incomes of
134-185 percent of poverty, we find that 27
percent and 59 percent, respectively, of the
increase in Medicaid coverage over the period
is attributable to the crowding out of em-
ployer insurance, although the standard er-
rors are large because of the smaller sample
sizes. Even though the data do not permit us
to assess this definitively, the 27 percent
crowding-out estimate for the group with in-
come of 100-133 percent of poverty is consis-
tent with that found for children up to age ten
using the same methodology.23 Together these
findings suggest that more crowding out will
occur as Medicaid eligibility expansions move
up the income ladder, and that there is much
less crowding out for eligibility levels under
133 percent of poverty.
To estimate the total crowding-out effect,
we must account for the fact that two-thirds
of women gaining Medicaid coverage over the
expansion period (for whom there was no ap-
parent crowding out) had incomes below the
federal poverty line. When we do this, using
step four above, we estimate that 14 percent of
the overall increase in Medicaid coverage for
pregnant women that occurred between 1988
and 1991 is attributable to the crowding out of
employer-sponsored coverage.24
To shed light on what accounts for the in-
creases in Medicaid enrollment over the pe-
riod, we decomposed the increase in Medicaid
coverage into its components (Exhibit 3). An
estimated 71 percent of the increase in Medic-
aid enrollment was from pregnant women
who would have been uninsured if it were not
for Medicaid. And while 14 percent of the in-
crease is attributable to declines in employer-
sponsored coverage because of crowding out,
almost an equal amount was attributable to
declines in employer-sponsored coverage re-
sulting from either the erosion of employer-
sponsored coverage or business-cycle effects.

This latter group likely would have been un-
insured if not for Medicaid expansions.
Discussion
Do our results explain the lack of strong ef-
fects found for the Medicaid eligibility expan-
sions for pregnant women? Certainly, the low
Medicaid participation rates for pregnant
women covered under the expansions are a
partial explanation for the lack of a strong
impact. The reason for the low participation
rates is unclear. Further research is needed to
aid our understanding of whether women
who are eligible under the poverty-related ex-
pansions are unaware of their eligibility for
Medicaid, whether they are unwilling to en-
roll because of the stigma associated with
Medicaid coverage, or whether major prob-
lems remain in the eligibility determination
process. Given the large percentage of unin-
sured pregnant women who are eligible for
Medicaid, it is important for states to develop
strategies to identify such women and to help
them receive services early in pregnancy.
Also, the apparent shift from employer-
sponsored to Medicaid coverage for the near-
poor, resulting from both the erosion of and
the crowding out of employer coverage,
means that Medicaid is substituting for some
of what would have been private insurance
coverage in prior years. This may account, in
part, for the lack of strong improvement in
access to prenatal care and birth outcomes for
the nation as a whole. It is possible, however,
that states that raised the income threshold
for pregnant women only up to the mandated
level (133 percent of poverty) and had low
AFDC eligibility thresholds or low levels of
employer coverage prior to the expansions
may have had less crowding out and may
therefore see more positive effects from ex-
panded eligibility than other states.
· Policy implications. First, given that the
Medicaid expansions took place when em-
ployer coverage was deteriorating, the
number of pregnant women lacking insurance
coverage almost certainly would have risen in
the absence of more generous coverage poli-
cies for pregnant women--a trend that would
have been most acute for the near-poor.
Second, extending Medicaid coverage up
to the federal poverty level is likely to involve
very little crowding out and to greatly reduce
the number without insurance. However, ex-
tending Medicaid coverage above the poverty
level may well lead to crowding out, given the
greater extent of employer-sponsored cover-
age of the near-poor and the untenable finan-
cial burden these families may face to retain
such coverage. The effect is likely to vary ac-
cording to how far above the poverty line eli-
gibility is increased. At the same time, limiting
Medicaid coverage to those in poverty will
leave a large number of near-poor persons
without insurance coverage. States that raise
eligibility standards above the federal poverty
line may want to implement policies that en-
courage employers and individuals to main-
tain their level of effort.
Several states with Medicaid Section 1115
waivers have proposed or implemented such
policies. For example, Hawaii mandates that
employers provide insurance to all full-time
employees, and Rhode Island requires that
children and pregnant women with incomes
over 185 percent of poverty be under- or
uninsured to obtain Medicaid coverage. In ad-
dition, some states have begun to take advan-
tage of federal legislation that allows Medic-
aid to pay copayments, deductibles, and
premium contributions under the employer
plans of Medicaid-eligible persons in an effort
to maintain employer contributions.
Our research raises three important public
policy questions. To what extent does Medic-
aid crowd out private insurance with expan-
sions of the program? For what reasons do
women who choose to substitute Medicaid
for employer-sponsored coverage do so? And
what is the trade-off with such expansions
between crowding out and no insurance at
all? Definitive information on each is essential
for policymakers who are considering further
changes to the Medicaid program.

would be covered by Medicaid.
5. This does not mean to imply that employer cov-
erage is preferable to Medicaid. Medicaid covers
all preventive care visits and some enhanced
services and does not require deductibles and
copayments; private insurance coverage often
entails cost sharing, which may inhibit some
low-income women from obtaining timely or
comprehensive obstetric care. Yet the well-
documented access and quality problems within
Medicaid may present major barriers to timely
and appropriate care for some pregnant women.
Therefore, substituting Medicaid for employer
coverage could lead to better or worse access and
outcomes, depending on the characteristics of
both coverages.

10. Other things equal, we would have preferred to
use the 1987 or the 1988 March CPS, which cap-
ture insurance coverage in 1986 and 1987, as
preexpansion years. We chose not to do so be-
cause changes in CPS questions and improve-
ments to the TRIM2 model that occurred during
this period distort comparisons with later years.
The 1989 version of the CPS is the first year that
contains both the revised CPS questions and
uses the improved TRIM2 methodology. There-
fore, we use the TRIM2 edited version of the
March 1989 CPS--income and health insurance
coverage for March 1988--as our base year. Use
of the March 1988 CPS as a base-year file under-
estimates any changes that occurred as a result
of the expansions, given that twenty-five states
had increased Medicaid eligibility for pregnant
women to 100 percent of poverty by March 1988.
However, it still allows us to examine the direc-
tion and sources of changes in coverage. We be-
lieve that the underestimation will affect only
poor women and will be minimal because infor-
mation from the hospital discharge survey shows
that the increase in Medicaid-covered deliveries
was small (1.26 percentage points) between 1987
and 1988, compared with almost four percentage
points between 1988 and 1989, 1989 and 1990,
and 1990 and 1991. These data suggest that there
was a lag between when expansions were imple-
mented on paper and when women knew about
their eligibility and enrolled, and that the use of

mated our analysis using only states that raised
eligibility to 100 percent of poverty after 1988
and still found no crowding out of employer cov-
erage for the poor. Thus, we believe that our esti-
mates using the later data are reliable.
11. Additional details are available from the authors

12. In 1988, 51 percent of persons with family in-
comes of 100-200 percent of poverty had
employer-sponsored coverage, whereas only 13
percent of those with incomes below 100 percent
had such insurance. Holahan et al., "A Shifting
Picture of Health Insurance Coverage."
13. K. Swartz, "Interpreting the Estimates from Four
National Surveys of the Number of People with-
out Health Insurance," journal of Economic and So-
cial Measurement 14 (1986): 233-242; Bureau of the
Census, Health Insurance Coverage: 1986-88, Current
Population Reports, Series P-70, no. 17 (Washing-
ton: U.S. GPO, 1990); and C. Winterbottom, D.
Liska, and K. Obermaier, State-Level Data Book on
Health Care Access and Financing (Washington: Ur-
ban Institute Press, 1995).
14. The TRIM2 model uses the health insurance
questions and other data from the CPS to create
health insurance status indicators for each indi-
vidual. In addition, TRIM2 corrects for under-
reporting of Medicaid enrollment and identifies
each Medicaid-eligible person's eligibility cate-
gory. To do this, TRIM2 passes each person on
the CPS through the various state rules for
Medicaid eligibility to identify which persons
are eligible for coverage. Statistical procedures
are used to choose enough additional persons
from the pool of eligible persons who did not
report coverage on the CPS to match the known
enrollment figures. For example, after correc-
tion, TRIM2 identified 24.3 million Medicaid en-
rollees on the March 1991 CPS, a figure much
closer to the 24.7 million known to have been
enrolled than to the 19.6 million reporting cover-
age on the uncorrected CPS. The TRIM2 model
aligns program enrollees with known enroll-
ment figures in each state by age and disability
group. When we use the unedited CPS, our
crowding-out estimates remain unchanged.
15. We first identify all infants under age one. We
then match infants to their mothers using infor-
mation on family structure and assume that the
mothers were pregnant during the previous year.
16. This occurs because (1) women who were preg-
nant during the year but did not deliver in the
relevant March-to-March period are not identi-
fied; and (2) not all infants can be matched with
a mother. The former issue should not bias analy-
ses of the percentage of pregnant women with
certain characteristics, because we are simply
taking a sample of pregnant women in a given
year: those who delivered their children in the
twelve months prior to the survey. The latter
issue may affect our results somewhat if the di-
mensions we are examining (income or insur-
ance coverage) are correlated with our inability
to identify the mother.
17. Although we are not certain of either the direc-
tion or the magnitude of this effect, we believe
that it is likely to result in a slight underestima-
tion of Medicaid coverage and a corresponding
overestimation of employer-sponsored coverage
and the uninsured. Based on 1991 data in Califor-
nia, Georgia, Michigan, and Tennessee, we esti-
mate that between 8 and 18 percent of all
Medicaid-financed deliveries are to women who
enrolled in Medicaid in the third trimester of
pregnancy. From this we estimate that the lack
of information on changes in insurance status of
these women in their last months of pregnancy
could translate into an underestimate of Medic-
aid coverage by 3.75 percent when the whole
sample is considered but should not affect esti-
mates of changes in health insurance coverage. In
addition, it may slightly underestimate actual
Medicaid participation rates.
18. Authors' computations of the percentage change
in average monthly employee contributions to-
ward health insurance premiums between 1989
and 1993 in medium and large firms. Bureau of
Labor Statistics Employer Benefits Survey, U.S.
Department of Labor, Bulletins 2363 and 2456.
19. Of changes in the rates of poor pregnant women
with Medicaid coverage, employer-sponsored
coverage, and no insurance coverage, only the
change in the rate of the uninsured was statisti-
cally significant at the 5 percent level.
20. At the 5 percent level, changes in the rates of
employer and Medicaid coverage for near-poor
pregnant women were statistically significant;
changes in the rate of uninsured near-poor preg-
nant women were not statistically significant.
21. Significant at the 5 percent level.
22. That is, take the difference between the percent-
age point changes in employer-sponsored insur-
ance for near-poor men ages eighteen to forty-
four and near-poor women and divide it by the
percentage-point change in Medicaid coverage
for near-poor pregnant women.
23. Dubay and Kenney, "The Effects of Medicaid Ex-
pansions on Insurance Coverage of Children."
24. The assumption that all those reporting both
Medicaid and employer-sponsored coverage had
employer coverage in 1988 and had Medicaid in
1992 gives an upper-bound estimate on the
crowding-out effect of 19 percent.
