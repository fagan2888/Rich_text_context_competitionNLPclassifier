Over the same period that saw the doubling of prevalence of
obesity, the prevalence of hypertension in US adults declined
from 34 to 25% (age-adjusted to the 2000 US population).1­3
For the purpose of tracking prevalence, hypertension is
defined to include persons currently taking antihypertensive
medication or having measured blood pressure (BP) above
recommended levels thus the increased use of medication over
this period does not explain the observed decline in hyperten-
sion prevalence.4­6 These trends emphasize the multifactorial
nature of hypertension etiology and highlight the necessity
of an evaluation of differences in measurement methods and
changes in population distribution of demographic and behav-
ioral factors. A trend analysis of hypertension in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) up
through 1991, was more detailed than other trends analyses
and included documentation of several important differences
but did not include an analysis of the effect of differences on
estimates.2 Ostchega and coauthors detailed training pro-
cedures in NHANES 1999­2000 and evaluated the effect
of measurement error on mean BP.7 Subsequent analysis of
trends in hypertension in NHANES did not include evaluation
of methods differences.8
The goal of this work is to gain a more complete under-
standing of the trends in hypertension, using data from the
NHANES surveys in 1976­1980 and 1999­2002. Previous
work documented methodologic differences in BP determi-
nation which may have contributed to the observed decline
in hypertension.2 The methods used in the 1976­1980

survey were different from the most recent survey with more

Methods
Using cross-sectional survey data from NHANES, we estimated
the effect on hypertension of incorrect blood pressure (BP) cuff
size and zero end-digit preference and the effect of changes in
the distribution of age, body mass index (BMI), sex, race-ethnicity,
smoking, and education.The analytic sample of persons 20­74 years
consisted of 11,563 from 1976­1980 and 7,901 from 1999­2002
NHANES. Covariate-adjusted prevalences were calculated using
loglinear regression models to produce predictive margins.
Results
After adjustment to age, BMI, sex, race-ethnicity, smoking, and
education, the prevalence difference became higher, changing
from -9% (95% confidence interval (CI): -11, -6) to -14%
(95 CI: -17, -11). After adjustment to these risk factors and
correction for measurement error the prevalence difference
was -9% (95 CI: -11, -6).
Conclusions
Measurement error, mainly from cuff size differences, inflated the
temporal decline in hypertension prevalence.The results indicate
that age, sex, race-ethnicity, smoking, or education did not fully
explain the lower prevalence of measured hypertension in all BMI
groups and suggest that a change in some unmeasured factor or
factors contributed to the decline.

Prevalence of Hypertension in 1976­1980 and 1999­2002

thorough training and more accurate methods being used
in the 1999­2002 survey. We first estimated the impact of
two sources of error in BP measurement for which methods
differed between surveys: incorrect cuff size and zero end-
digit preference. We then considered whether differences in

hypertension-related factors between the surveys may have
contributed to differences in the prevalence of hypertension in
US adults in 1976­1980 compared to 1999­2002. The factors
examined included age, sex, race-ethnicity, cigarette smoking,
and body mass index (BMI).
Methods
Study population. The NHANES used a cross-sectional design
with nationally representative samples with interview and
examination. The 1976­1980 sample included 27,801 eligible
persons 6 months­74 years, of whom 20,322 (73%) were inter-
viewed and examined (11,864 adults 20­74 years). A detailed
description of the survey design and operation has been pub-
lished elsewhere.9 The 1999­2002 sample included 25,316

eligible persons of all ages, of whom 19,759 (78%) were inter-
viewed and examined (8,817 adults 20­74 years). Detailed
information on the survey design and operation is available
at the NHANES website http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.
htm.10,11 The analyses in the present study were restricted
to adults 20­74 years, an age range covered in both surveys.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants and the
protocols were approved by the NCHS Ethics Review Board
for both surveys.
Measurements. More specific information was collected on
Mexican, Hispanic, or Latino ancestry in 1999­2002 but avail-
able information in 1976­1980 was used to create categories
similar to those available in the 1999­2002 survey, namely
non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and other race-
ethnicities.12,13
In both surveys mid-arm circumference and body weight
and height were measured similarly following standard-
ized procedures with calibrated equipment.9­11,14 BMI was

calculated as weight in kg divided by height in m2. The follow-
ing categories of BMI were used: underweight (BMI < 18.5),
normal weight (BMI 18.5­22.9 and 23.0­24.9), overweight
or preobese (BMI 25.0­27.4 and 27.5­29.9), and obese class I
(BMI 30.0­32.4 and 32.5­34.9), obese class II (35.0­37.4 and
37.5­39.9) and obese class III (BMI  40.0).15
In 1976­1980 two seated measurements were taken and in
1999­2002, three seated measurements were taken. In both
surveys BP was measured using a mercury sphygmomano
meter by physicians to the nearest two mmHg. For this anal-
ysis, hypertension was defined using the current definition
of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC):
systolic pressure of 140mmHg or higher or diastolic pressure
of 90mmHg or higher or current treatment with antihyper-
tensive medicine.16 This definition was applied to the mean of
the two measurements in 1976­1980 and the mean of two or
three measurements in 1999­2002.
In 1976­1980, the proportion of zero end digits was higher
than the expected 20% in a uniform distribution of the five
possible end digits.2 In 1999­2000 the percent of measure-
ments ending in zero was close to the expected 20%.7 We
adjusted BP for zero end-digit preference using an algorithm
to impute values. In each survey the mean and s.d. of the first
systolic measurement was used to calculate the expected rela-
tive frequency of observations at 140 and 138mmHg assum-
ing a log-normal distribution (Table 1). The observed data
were imputed so that the relative frequency of observations at
140 and 138mmHg was equal to that expected in a log-normal
distribution. We randomly selected observations at 140mmHg
to impute to 138mmHg. Diastolic pressures were adjusted in a
similar fashion.
The definition of diastolic BP used in 1976­1980 was the
level "at the point of complete cessation of Korotkoff sounds
(fifth sound) or if no cessation occurred, at the point of muf-
fling (fourth sound)" (p. 4).17 Unfortunately the data files
do not include an indicator of whether Korotkoff V (K5) or
Korotkoff IV (K4) was recorded. In contrast in 1999­2002
the diastolic pressure was recorded as K5. The effect of this
difference is that some individuals in 1976­1980 might have
been classified as hypertensive using K4 but would not using
K5, thus 1976­1980 prevalence might be higher because of
this. Lack of data on whether K4 or K5 was recorded compli-
cates any attempt to model the effect of this difference on the
hypertension prevalence difference. Given that hyperten-
sion is the outcome in this study, the effect of the use of K4

instead of K5 is only relevant at the cutpoint of 90mmHg.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis similar to that done
for the effect of zero end-digit preference. We changed all
diastolic BP observations at 90­88mmHg and calculated the
prevalence of hypertension after imputation, modeling the
effect of an extreme assumption that all diastolic measure-
ments recorded as 90mmHg were measurements of K4 and
the corresponding level of K5 would have been <90mmHg.
The prevalence of hypertension in 1976­1980 showed a
moderate decrease from 33.9 to 32.0% and in 1999­2002
from 25.3 to 24.5%.
The 1988 American Heart Association recommendations
for BP measurement included corrections for BP not meas-
ured with appropriate cuff size based on a study by Maxwell
and coauthors.18,19 They developed correction equations
for measurements by three cuffs: 12-cm, 15-cm, and 18-cm.
In 1999­2002, five cuffs were available: 6-cm, 9-cm, 12-cm,
15-cm, and 18-cm. In 1976­1980 only two cuffs were used:
9-cm and 12-cm. In 1976­1980, 32.4% of participants had
arm circumferences >33cm, the upper acceptable circumfer-
ence for a 12-cm cuff according to the 1988 American Heart
Association recommendations, and thus should be corrected.
Larger cuffs were available in 1999­2002 and Ostchega and
coauthors reported that correct cuff sizes were used on over
86% of participants in 1999­2000.7 We used Maxwell's equa-
tions to correct all observed measurements in the 1976­1980
survey. Although the frequency of incorrect cuff size use is less
in the 1999­2002 survey, we applied the same corrections to
make the data more comparable.
For each cuff size the equation is based on ideal arm cir-
cumference, for example for the 12-cm cuff an arm circumfer-
ence of 30cm is the ideal size and for a circumference of 32cm
the systolic BP correction would be -2mmHg. The majority
of participants had nonzero corrections in both surveys; for
obese persons in 1976­1980, 99.0% of systolic readings were
corrected and 98.6% of diastolic readings; and for 1999­2002,
83.4% of systolic and 75.2% of diastolic readings.
In 1976­1980, 26 participants were measured with the
9-cm cuff. In 1999­2002 for the one participant measured
with the 6-cm cuff and 217 measured with the 9-cm cuff, cor-
rections were made using the equation for a 12-cm cuff since
the study by Maxwell and coauthors did not include cuffs
smaller than 12-cm.
Exclusions. In 1976­1980 of the 11,864 examined adults 20­74
years old, 15 (0.1%) were missing both BP measurements and
medication information, 33 (0.3%) were missing BMI, four
(0.03%) were missing information on cigarette smoking, and
249 (2.1%) were missing information on education level. The
analytic sample consisted of 11,563 participants with complete
data. In 1999­2002 of the 8,817 examined adults 20­74 years
old, 720 (8.2%) failed to complete the BP component, 171
(1.9%) were missing BMI, 11 (0.1%) were missing information
on cigarette smoking, and 14 (0.2%) were missing informa-
tion on education level. The analytic sample consisted of 7,901

participants with complete data.
Statistical methods. Analyses were conducted using SAS
(
version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (version
9.0.1; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)
with examined sample weights and sample design variables to
account for the clustered design and produce nationally repre-
sentative estimates.20­22 Previous papers on trends in hyper-
tension reported declines adjusted only for age. One of our
purposes was to explore whether changes in the distribution of
other measured characteristics explained the observed decline.
Because age-adjusted estimates formed the basis of our ques-
tions we used similarly age-adjusted estimates as our starting
point so as not to attribute any part of the observed decline to
the aging of the population. For both surveys, estimates were
adjusted by the direct method to the 2000 US population using
the 20-year intervals: 20­39 years, 40­59 years, and 60­74
years. Differences between surveys in demographic character-
istics were tested for statistical significance using t-tests, with
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.23
We modeled the association of hypertension with selected
risk factors and present model results as predicted prevalences
and differences. Log-linear regression models were used to cal-
culate predictive margins with data from the two surveys com-
bined. Predictive margins provide predicted prevalences based
on the estimated model coefficients adjusted to the distribution
of the covariates included in the model.8,24­27 The predicted
values for each survey were adjusted to the 
combined sample
distribution of covariates and adjustments were 
model-specific.
The predicted values for each survey-BMI category were cal-
culated using the same approach. Previous papers on trends in
hypertension that reported a decline used estimates standard-
ized for age with 20-year age intervals.2,8,28,29 Given that our
purpose was to consider possible explanations for this reported
decline we used similar 20-year age-adjusted estimates as the
base for comparisons.
To evaluate the effect of measurement error, we created sep-
arate models using hypertension status corrected for cuff size,
corrected for zero end-digit preference, and using hyperten-
sion status corrected for both sources of measurement error;
these models included age defined using 20-year intervals as
the independent variable. We estimated predicted prevalences
and differences after adjustment for measured risk factors
with and without measurement error corrections. In order
to examine possible variation in the prevalence difference by
BMI category, we produced estimates by BMI for hyperten-
sion as observed and after measurement error correction and
with adjustment for age, sex, race-ethnicity, smoking, and
education.
Results
There were differences between the two populations in some
demographic characteristics associated with hypertension
(Table 2).30 The percent of 20­29 decreased (P < 0.01), the
percent of 40­49-year olds and 60­69-year olds increased
(P < 0.01 for both comparisons), the percent of non-Hispanic
whites decreased (P < 0.01), the percent of persons with more
than high-school education increased (P < 0.01), and the

percent of never smokers increased (P < 0.01). The previously
noted doubling in the prevalence of obesity is reflected in the
increases between the two populations in the two higher BMI
categories (BMI  30.0). This change in the BMI distribution
of the population might be expected to result in an increase
in hypertension prevalence assuming the association was the
same in 1999­2002 as in 1976­1980.
After adjusting to the age distribution of the combined

survey population the difference in the predicted hypertension
prevalence was -8.6% points (95% confidence interval (CI):
-11.4, -5.7) and decreased after correction for 
measurement
error (Figure 1). After correction for cuff size, the age-

adjusted difference decreased to a difference of -5.0% points
(95% CI: -7.8, -2.3). Correction for zero end-digit preference
in both surveys reduced the difference to -7.3% points (95%
CI: -10.1, -4.4). After correction for both sources of measure-
ment error, the estimated age-adjusted difference was -4.8%
points, 95% CI: -7.5, -2.0).
The decrease in the predicted prevalence difference after
correction for cuff size was primarily due to a lowering of the
predicted prevalence estimate for 1976­1980 (Table 3). The
larger cuff size corrections seen for the 1976­1980 estimates
were because of unavailability of larger cuff sizes. Arm circum-
ference was correlated with BMI and thus the corrections for
incorrect cuff size were larger for overweight and obese per-
sons measured with an incorrect cuff. For adults 20­74 years,
the mean arm circumference was 31.3cm in 1976­1980 and
33.0cm in 1999­2002 and increased with BMI level in both
surveys.
The observed prevalence difference was larger after adjust-
ment for BMI and age (-14.7 points, 95% CI: -17.6, -11.7) than
after adjustment for age alone (Figure 2). This was

All estimates other than age-specific estimates were adjusted by the direct method to

P < 0.01, the -level reflecting adjustment for multiple comparisons. bIn both surveys
smoking status was categorized as never smokers (defined as persons who reported
not smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their life), former smokers (defined as persons who
reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their life but were not currently smoking),
and current smokers (defined as persons who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes
in their life and were currently smoking).

due to a rise in the predicted prevalence for 1976­1980 from
33.9 to 37.7% (Table 3). This result was in contrast to what
one might have expected after adjustment for BMI and age
and suggests that the association of obesity and hypertension
was different in 1976­1980 and in 1999­2002. The interaction
of survey and BMI was tested using the Satterwaite-adjusted
F-test with models using hypertension before and after correc-
tion for measurement error and produced P values of 0.01 and
0.45, respectively. This indicates that after correction for meas-
urement error the association of obesity and hypertension did
not differ between surveys. Adjustment for sex, race-ethnicity,
and education level made little difference in the prevalence or
prevalence differences compared to the age-adjusted rates.
After adjustment for all the putative risk factors combined
(BMI, age, sex, race-ethnicity, smoking, and education) the
predicted difference in hypertension prevalence between sur-
veys was larger than after adjustment for age alone but simi-
lar to the adjustment for BMI and age (-14.0 points, 95% CI:
-16.9, -10.9). This increase in the predicted difference was
also seen when using hypertension prevalence corrected for
measurement error (-8.0 points, 95% CI: -10.8, -5.1).
Given our a priori interest in understanding the trends in
hypertension with the increase in obesity prevalence across
surveys, we estimated the predicted prevalence of 
hypertension
within the five BMI categories after adjusting for sex, race-

ethnicity, age, education, and smoking (Table 4). We found
that the prevalence of hypertension increased with increasing
BMI category in both surveys before and after correction for
measurement error. Without measurement error corrections

Prevalence of Hypertension in 1976­1980 and 1999­2002
the difference in hypertension prevalence between surveys
tended to be larger in overweight and obese subjects than in
those who were underweight or normal weight. After correc-
tion for measurement error the difference between surveys
was more similar between overweight and obese subjects and
normal weight subjects.
Discussion
The decline in the prevalence of hypertension was only partially
explained by measurement error due to cuff size or end-digit
preference and by differences in the distribution of BMI, sex,
age, race-ethnicity, education, or smoking between surveys.
The decline in hypertension reported from the NHANES has
been reported in other studies as well. A decline in hyperten-
sion was reported between 1980­1982 and 1985­1987 in the
Minnesota Heart Survey and similar trends in BP in Finland
were reported between 1982 and 1987.31,32 In Australia, the
prevalence of hypertension decreased between 1980 and 1989
primarily due to a decrease in undiagnosed hypertension.33
Unmeasured or unidentified changes in the US population
between the two time periods may further explain the decline
in the prevalence of hypertension. Dietary intake is one behav-
ior that was measured in the surveys, but differences in the
methodologies used made standardization across surveys diffi-
cult.34 Beneficial changes in diet are not likely given analysis of
NHANES trends reported for 1971­2000 for the total US pop-
ulation of increased sodium intake and no increase in intake of
fruits, vegetables, or low-fat dairy foods.34 In addition, recent
analysis of NHANES data from 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2004
suggest that the percentage of hypertensive persons following
a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trail (DASH)-
accordant diet has decreased.35 In addition, a decline in the
proportion of adults with no leisure-time physical activity was
reported for the time period from 1988 to 2000.36
Limitations of this study include inability to adjust for 
several
methodologic differences between the surveys. More inten-
sive and frequent training for BP measurement was conducted
in 1999­2002 than in 1976-1980. The most recent recom-
mendations for BP measurement from the American Heart
Association identified end-digit preference as a commonly used
indicator of measurement quality.37 The high prevalence of
zero end digits in the 1976-1980 data suggest the amount and
quality of training during that survey was less than subsequent
NHANES surveys which included improved standardization of
training reflected in lower proportions of zero end digits.2,7 The
prevalence differences were attenuated after correction for cuff
size, due to lowering of the 1976-1980 estimates. This under-
scores the importance of the use of appropriate techniques
and equipment in measuring BP. It is possible that the correc-
tion equations were not appropriate. The study by Maxwell and
coauthors was based on BP measured in a sample of 1,240 obese
patients enrolled in a rapid weight loss study.19 As far as we are
aware the equations have not been validated elsewhere. In addi-
tion our corrections did not take into account the variability of
the equations. The adjustment equations developed by Maxwell
and coauthors have been applied in recent NHANES analyses
and 
confirmation of these 
adjustment equations would be an
important contribution.38,39
We found that adjusting for the distribution of BMI in the
combined survey population increased the difference in the
prevalence of hypertension between the two surveys. This
was true even after correction for measurement error. This
indicates that obese persons (BMI 30.0) in 1999-2002 had a
lower rate of hypertension than obese persons in 1976-1980.
The similarity in the decline in hypertension in normal weight
and obese persons after correction for measurement error sug-
gests a change in some factor or factors that affected all persons
regardless of BMI. Furthermore, we found that the observed
prevalence difference increased with increasing BMI, however
after adjustment for measurement error the differences were
more similar.
