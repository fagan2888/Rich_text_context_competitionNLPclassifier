Body image is an individual's internal representation of his
or her outer self (Thompson, Heinberg, Altabe, & Tantleff-
Dunn, 1999). Body image concerns are associated with a
number of negative outcomes including lower self-esteem,
increased risk of depression, social anxiety, and eating
pathologies (Kostanski & Gullone, 1998; Levine & Smolak,
2002; McCaulay, Mintz, & Glenn, 1988; Stice, 2002). Given
the potential negative implications of body image concerns,
identifying situations or the contextual factors of situations
in which these concerns arise is important. Examples of spe-
cific situations that exacerbate body image concerns include
being seen in a bathing suit, being next to someone with an
attractive/ideal physique, or having body composition
assessed (Carron & Prapavessis, 1997; Hart, Leary, &
Rejeski, 1989).
Qualitative research has explored situations of heightened
body image concerns (Bain, Wilson, & Chaikind, 1989;
Lamarche, Kerr, Faulkner, Gammage, & Klentrou, 2012;
Myers & Rosen, 1999). For example, in their qualitative
study, Lamarche and colleagues (2012) examined comfort-
able and uncomfortable body experiences in young adult
women. These authors found that the situations described
were social-evaluative in nature and included an element of
body exposure. Furthermore, coping mechanisms such as
avoidance or concealing behaviors were initiated to manage
those uncomfortable situations. Experimental studies have
also shown that situations that maximize social evaluation of
one's body elicit body image concerns (Cloudt, Lamarche, &
Gammage, 2014; Gammage, Martin Ginis, & Hall, 2004;
Hart et al., 1989; Van Raalte, Cunningham, Cornelius, &
Brewer, 2004). In addition, situations in which body image
concerns are elicited (i.e., viewing media images of the thin
ideal, situations of heightened self-objectification) have been
shown to have lingering effects (Hausenblas, Janelle,
Gardner, & Hagan, 2003; Quinn, Kallen, & Cathey, 2006).
Recently, physiological measures have been incorporated
into body image research to gain an understanding of the
psychobiology of body image (Anderson, Shapiro, Lundgren,
Spataro, & Frye, 2002; Cloudt et al., 2014; Lamarche, Bailey,
& Gammage, 2015; Lamarche, Gammage, Kerr, Faulkner, &

Psychological and Cortisol Responses to
and Recovery From Exposure to a Body
Image Threat

Abstract
The majority of body image research has failed to measure what occurs beyond the immediate presentation of a body
image threat, or after a body image threat is no longer present. This is particularly true for physiological outcomes. The
present study examined psychological and cortisol responses to, and recovery from, a body composition assessment as a
social-evaluative body image threat. Women (N = 64) were randomized into either a control or threat group. Participants
completed a measure of social physique anxiety and provided a sample of saliva (to assess cortisol) at baseline, and immediately
following and 20 min following their condition. The threat group reported higher social physique anxiety following the
threat in comparison with both baseline levels and recovery levels. Cortisol was higher immediately following the threat in
comparison with baseline levels. Findings support the inclusion of a recovery time point in body image research to provide a
more complete picture of the psychobiology of body image experiences.

Sabiston, Castonguay, Barnett, O'Loughlin, & Lambert,
2009). The most commonly assessed in this recent literature
is cortisol (a stress hormone thought to represent hypotha-
lamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation; Sapolsky, 2003).
Given this recent interest in physiological variables in a
body image context, social self-preservation theory (SSPT;
Dickerson, Gruenewald, & Kemeny, 2004), in contrast to
other theories of body image, may be particularly useful in
the examination of responses to social-evaluative body
image threats. SSPT suggests that when a social-evaluative
threat is present, negative self-conscious emotions and phys-
iological responses are elicited concurrently (Dickerson,
Gruenewald, & Kemeny, 2004). Shame and cortisol are par-
ticularly responsive to such threats, although other psycho-
logical (i.e., guilt) and physiological (heart rate,
proinflammatory cytokines) outcomes have been examined
within SSPT (Dickerson, Gable, Irwin, Aziz, & Kemeny,
2009; Dickerson, Kemeny, Aziz, Kim, & Fahey, 2004).
Generally, research has supported the contentions of SSPT
by examining psychobiological responses to the Trier Social
Stress Test, a performance-based social-evaluative task
(Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993). Recently, SSPT
has been applied to a body image context (Bailey, Lamarche,
& Gammage, 2014; Cloudt et al., 2014; Lamarche et al.,
2015; Lamarche et al., 2014; Lamarche et al., 2012; Martin
Ginis et al., 2012).
Martin Ginis et al. (2012) provided the first empirical sup-
port of a cortisol response to a social-evaluative body image
threat. In the first experiment, women thought they would be
exercising in a high social-evaluative threatening setting (in
a public, mirrored exercise facility while wearing revealing
exercise attire) or a low social-evaluative threatening setting
(alone, in a private, non-mirrored room while wearing non-
revealing exercise attire). In their second experiment, partici-
pants were asked to go behind a screen into a changing area
to try on exercise clothing and complete a questionnaire rat-
ing the exercise clothing (e.g., color, fabric). In the high
social-evaluative condition, participants were led to believe
that after completing the questionnaire, a video camera
would record the participant in the clothing so that a panel of
judges could evaluate how well the clothing fit at a later date.
Participants in the low social-evaluative condition were
instructed to change into the exercise clothing behind the
screen and complete the same questionnaire package; how-
ever, they were told that no one would see them. Across both
experiments the results indicated that cortisol levels were
higher post-manipulation for those in the high versus low
social-evaluative condition.
Although these authors were the first to provide evidence
of a cortisol response to a social-evaluative body image
threat, they noted significant limitations regarding their
threat. Given their ethics board guidelines, they were unable
to actually expose participants to the social-evaluative body
image threat. They predicted that cortisol responses would
have been greater had participants actually faced the threat
and emphasized that "actual threat exposure in an ethical and
ecologically valid manner is necessary to test this hypothe-
sis" (Martin Ginis et al., 2012, p. 1004). Lamarche et al.
(2015) examined psychological and heart rate responses to
an imagined social-evaluative body image threat. Findings
showed that the highest levels of body shame and social phy-
sique anxiety were reported in the social-evaluative com-
pared with the non-social-evaluative body image condition.
However, no differences in heart rate were found between
groups. In agreement with Martin Ginis et al. (2012), it was
noted that actual threat exposure may be necessary to capture
more robust physiological changes under social-evaluative
body image threat, and fully understand the psychobiology
of body image.
The implications of the potential differences in responses
to anticipating and actually facing a threat are important. For
example, responses to the mere anticipation of a threatening
situation particularly negative may cause people to avoid
engaging in specific body-related situations (e.g., swimming,
having sex, exercising); however, if such responses can be
overcome, some people may feel that the situation was not as
bad (or threatening) as originally believed (Lamarche et al.,
2012; Mills, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, & Holmes, 2014).
One recent study developed a novel weight stigma para-
digm in which participants were actually exposed to an inter-
personal rejection based on weight stigma (Himmelstein,
Belsky, & Tomiyama, 2015). Specifically, the authors manip-
ulated weight stigma to examine its impact on cortisol reac-
tivity. In addition, body mass index (BMI) and self-perceived
weight were examined as potential moderators of the rela-
tionship between stigma and cortisol reactivity. These
authors found that the weight stigma situation elicited
changes in cortisol, and that those who perceived themselves
as "heavy" (regardless of their actual BMI) exhibited higher
cortisol in response to the weight stigma situation compared
with those who perceived themselves as average weight.
Although growing evidence suggests that cortisol may be
elicited under body-related threats, the majority of the body
image literature has examined only immediate responses to
such threats and still ignores what occurs after the body
image threat is removed. Recent evidence examining
responses to a social-evaluative non-body image threat sug-
gests that failing to examine a recovery phase may lead to
erroneous conclusions regarding the distress of the individ-
ual (Juster, Perna, Marin, Sindi, & Lupien, 2012).
Furthermore, there is some, albeit limited, evidence of the
lingering negative effects of body-related situations
(Hausenblas et al., 2003; Quinn et al., 2006). Thus, to gain a
more complete picture of the response-recovery profile to a
body image threat, the current study measured outcomes
immediately following the threat and after a rest period in
which the threat was no longer present.
The threat used in the present study was a three-site skin-
fold assessment while wearing a two-piece bathing suit. This
threat was selected for several theoretical and methodological
Lamarche et al. 3
reasons. First, this threat is based on characteristics under
which perceptions of, and responses to, social-evaluative
threatening situations are most likely to occur as supported by
SSPT (Rohleder, Beilen, Chen, Wolf, & Kirschbaum, 2007).
Specifically, it involves a social-evaluative element (i.e.,
evaluates body composition by a trained technician and assis-
tant), involves a domain of importance (i.e., body fat is an
important characteristic associated with the North American
thin ideal), and the potential loss of social acceptance from a
negative evaluation (i.e., a poor body composition may serve
as a reminder that one does not meet the thin ideal standard).
Second, a qualitative study framed within SSPT identified
being seen in a bathing suit by others as the most uncomfort-
able situation (Lamarche et al., 2012)--being in a bathing suit
or increasing the level of body exposure has been an impor-
tant aspect of manipulations designed to elicit body image
concerns (Carron & Prapavessis, 1997; Gammage et al.,
2004; Hart et al., 1989; Martin Ginis et al., 2012). Third,
anticipation of this specific threat has been shown to elicit
social physique anxiety and body shame responses (Cloudt
et al., 2014; Lamarche et al., 2014), thus it is possible that
actually exposing an individual to this threat would also elicit
a cortisol response, similar to responses to a weight stigma
situation (Himmelstein et al., 2015). Fourth, a skinfold assess-
ment was originally used to validate a questionnaire measur-
ing social physique anxiety (Hart et al., 1989). Fifth, a body
composition assessment through skinfold measurements is
commonly used in clinical and research settings, making it
acceptable to the research ethics boards. Finally, as reported
by Lamarche et al. (2014), self-rating of perceived evaluative
threat in anticipation of this exact situation was significantly
higher than a control group in a similar sample of women
compared with the present study.
Specifically, the purpose of the current study was to
examine psychobiological responses to, and recovery from,
actually undergoing (i.e., facing) a body image threat in
women. Based on the findings of Gammage et al. (2004) and
Hart et al. (1989), and the work of Martin Ginis et al. (2012)
with respect to cortisol changes from a body image threat, it
was hypothesized that the body image threat would elicit
increased social physique anxiety and cortisol and that these
variables would not return to baseline levels after the threat
was removed (i.e., levels would remain significantly higher
than baseline levels). The hypothesis with respect to the
recovery of variables is based on Quinn et al.'s (2006) find-
ing of the lingering effects of body-related thoughts after
being exposed to a situation designed to heighten body image
concerns. It was also hypothesized that participants in the
control condition would report no differences in body image
variables or cortisol levels across their testing visit.
Method
Participants
Upon institutional ethics clearance, participants were
recruited through posters placed around a university campus
and announcements made in undergraduate classes. To dis-
guise the true purpose of the study, the recruitment materials
indicated the study was examining the relationship between
self-perceptions, anthropometric measurements, and corti-
sol. Furthermore, the reason given to participants regarding
the required clothing for the research session (described
below) was that it was standard clothing used in the labora-
tory for anthropometric tests. The estimated required sample
size of 60 was based on Martin Ginis et al. (2012) showing
large effects of social-evaluative body image threats on cor-
tisol in women (Cohen's d = 0.81-1.16; Cohen, 1992). After
data screening (detailed below), the final sample consisted of
64 healthy, young adult women attending university (see
Table 1 for sample characteristics). It should be noted that all
but one participant were Caucasian. Varsity athletes, smok-
ers, individuals with a history of a clinical eating disorder, or
those on medications that influence cortisol secretion (e.g.,
corticosteroids) were excluded from participation.
Participants were also excluded if they ate, drank, or partici-
pated in physical activity within 1 hr prior to testing.
Measures
Participants completed demographic information (age, fre-
quency of exercise) and answered a series of questions ensur-
ing that they had complied with study requirements with
respect to food, drink, and physical activity participation.
Next, a measure of state social physique anxiety was admin-
istered (see description below).
Social physique anxiety. The nine-item State Social Physique
Anxiety Scale (SPAS; Kruisselbrink, Dodge, Swanburg, &
MacLeod, 2004) assessed anxiety associated with others'
evaluations of one's body. The items were measured on a
5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all characteristic of me)
to 5 (extremely characteristic of me). Participants were
instructed to respond to each item by indicating how they felt
at that moment. A sample item is "Unattractive features of
my physique/figure make me nervous in this setting." This

questionnaire has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and
validity in young adult women in past research (Kruissel-
brink et al., 2004; Martin Ginis, Murru, Conlin, & Strong,
2011). Internal consistency for the present study was deemed
adequate for each time point (s range = .88-.93).
Salivary cortisol.Measuring cortisol in saliva is a reliable,
stress-free, non-invasive technique that does not require a
trained technician (Vinning, McGinley, Maksvytis, & Ho,
1983). Several studies have used salivary cortisol in their
protocols (e.g., Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004; Martin Ginis
et al., 2012; Rohleder et al., 2007). Saliva was collected
using salivettes specific for cortisol measurement (Sarstedt,
Germany). Participants placed the dental cotton piece in their
mouths and left it there for 1 min, then placed the cotton back
into the test tube and sealed it. Samples were centrifuged
immediately and then placed in a -80 °C freezer until being
assayed. Salivary cortisol concentration was measured in
duplicate by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sali-
metrics, 2010). The inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients
of variability were calculated and deemed acceptable (<15%
and <10%, respectively).
Procedures
Interested participants contacted the principal investigator
and a mutually convenient time for participation was set.
After confirming a test session, participants were randomly
assigned to either the control or threat group by drawing a
number out of a hat. Participants assigned to the control
group were asked to bring shorts and a t-shirt to their visit,
whereas participants in the threat group were asked to bring
a two-piece bathing suit. Participants in both groups were
told that this clothing was standard laboratory attire to allow
for the accuracy of anthropometric measures, which would
be completed during the testing session. Upon arrival at the
laboratory, participants provided informed consent and com-
pleted demographic information. Next, participants com-
pleted a measure of state social physique anxiety. This time
served as a baseline rest period prior to cortisol collection.
Participants then provided a baseline saliva sample.
Next, participants completed the threat/control condition,
depending on their group assignment. Participants in the
control condition were asked to sit quietly alone for 15 min.
Quiet rest served as a control condition to be consistent with
past research measuring cortisol responses to a social-evalu-
ative threat in the non-body image literature (Kirschbaum
et al., 1993; Nater et al., 2007). Those in the threat condition
faced the social-evaluative body image threat (see descrip-
tion below). Participants were then asked to sit while they
completed the same measure of state social physique anxiety
and provided another saliva sample (response measures).
The response saliva sample was completed approximately 25
min after the onset of the threat/quiet rest, capturing the peak
cortisol response (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). Participants
in the threat group then changed back into their street clothes.
After completing their condition (i.e., quiet rest or threat),
participants sat quietly for 15 more minutes (i.e., threat was
no longer present), and then completed the same measure of
state social physique anxiety followed by a final saliva sam-
ple (recovery measures). The recovery saliva sample was
completed approximately 50 min following the onset of the
threat/quiet rest (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). Upon com-
pletion of all questionnaires and saliva samples, objective
measures of height, weight, and body composition were
taken for participants in the control group using the same
standard protocol described below, except that participants
wore shorts and a t-shirt for the body composition assess-
ment and only the technician was present. Participants were
debriefed as to the true purpose of the study and given
US$10.00 as compensation for their time. Given the circa-
dian rhythm of cortisol, all data collection took place at the
same time of day (15:00-18:00) when levels are relatively
constant (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004; Vinning et al., 1983).
Social-evaluative body image threat.
A body composition
assessment completed while participants wore a two-piece
bathing suit was selected as the social-evaluative body image
threat. Specifically, a standard three-site (triceps, iliac crest,
thigh) skinfold measurement was performed to assess per-
cent body fat (Jackson, Pollack, & Ward, 1980). The same
trained technician read measurements aloud to the same
research assistant, who verbally repeated each value, then
recorded it, thus allowing participants' body composition to
be evaluated by the researchers. The presence of the assistant
who recorded the values ensured there was an evaluative
audience, aside from the technician, increasing the likeli-
hood that a threat would be induced. This body image threat
maximized body exposure and evaluation of the body, but
was also acceptable to the research ethics board as these
anthropometric measures are typically taken for research,
clinical, athletic performance assessment, and educational
purposes. Furthermore, instructions for participants about
clothing (particularly the bathing suit) were also considered
realistic, as some body composition testing done at the uni-
versity requires participants to bring a bathing suit with
them.
Results
Nine participants (all randomized into the threat group) who
confirmed their eligibility, scheduled a testing appointment
and had knowledge of the clothing needed for participation,
did not attend their appointment. Of the 71 participants who
completed the study, five participants were removed for not
complying with study requirements or for feeling unwell.
Independent t tests showed no significant differences
between participants removed and the final sample on key
variables (all ps > .05). Data for cortisol were positively
Lamarche et al. 5
skewed so values were log-transformed for all analyses, sim-
ilar to previous studies investigating cortisol responses to
social-evaluative body image threats (Cloudt et al., 2014;
Lamarche et al., 2014; Martin Ginis et al., 2012). For cortisol
data, non-transformed data are provided for ease of interpre-
tation. Two participants were removed as outliers due to
implausible cortisol levels (>82.77 nmol/L; Salimetrics,
2010). Thus, the final data set included 64 participants.
Some research has demonstrated a relationship between
measures of body composition and social physique anxiety
(Hart et al., 1989), thus bivariate correlations were conducted
to examine BMI, weight, and percent body fat as potential
covariates for analyses. No relationship was found (p > .05).
To investigate baseline group differences on demographic
variables and state social physique anxiety and cortisol at
baseline, a series of t tests were conducted. The results indi-
cated no significant between-group differences on demo-
graphic variables or baseline variables (all ps > .05).
Relationships between social physique anxiety and cortisol
at all three time points were also examined. Results indicated
a significant positive relationship between state social phy-
sique anxiety and cortisol at the response time point (r = .25,
p < .05) and between cortisol at response and state social
physique anxiety at the recovery time point (r = .28, p < .05).
State Social Physique Anxiety
To compare the responses with, and recovery from, a social-
evaluative body image threat, a 2 (group: control, threat) × 3
(time: baseline, response, recovery) repeated-measures
ANOVA was conducted for social physique anxiety. There
was a significant group-by-time interaction, F(2, 61) = 4.36,
p = .017, 
p
2 = .13. To examine the nature of the time effects
within each group, three sets of paired t tests were conducted
(baseline vs. response, response vs. recovery, baseline vs.
recovery). A Bonferroni correction factor was applied for
follow-up analyses such that a p value < .017 would be
deemed significant. No differences were found within the
control group. Comparisons made within the threat group
showed that the level of social physique anxiety at response
was significantly higher than both baseline, t(30) = -3.64,
p = .001 (Cohen's d = .29; Cohen, 1992) and recovery levels,
t(30) = 3.70, p = .001 (Cohen's d = .34; Cohen, 1992). Levels
of social physique anxiety were not different between base-
line and recovery time points, t(30) = -1.27, p = .22. There
were no significant time, F(2, 61) = 2.14, p = .126, 
p
2 = .07
or group main effects, F(1, 62) = .36, p = .549, 
p
2 = .01. See
Table 2 for means and standard deviations for social physique
anxiety.
Cortisol
To compare the cortisol response with, and recovery from, a
social-evaluative body image threat, a 2 (group: control,
threat) × 3 (time: baseline, response, recovery) repeated-mea-
suresANOVAwas conducted with log-transformed cortisol as
the dependent variable. A Bonferroni correction factor was
applied for follow-up analyses. The Mauchly's test of spheric-
ity was significant; therefore, the Huynh­Feldt correction for
degrees of freedom is reported. There was a significant group-
by-time interaction, F(2, 108) = 6.78, p < .01, 
p
2 = .10. To
examine the nature of the time effects within each group, three
sets of paired t tests were conducted (baseline vs. response,
response vs. recovery, baseline vs. recovery). Comparisons
made within the control group showed that there was a signifi-
cant difference in levels of cortisol between baseline and
recovery time points, t(32) = 2.93, p = .006 (Cohen's d = .18;
Cohen, 1992), indicating a decrease in cortisol from baseline
to recovery time points. There was no significant change in
cortisol levels from baseline to response, t(32) = 1.79, p = .084
or response to recovery, t(32) = 2.33, p = .026 in the control
group. In the threat group, comparisons showed that there was
a significant increase in cortisol from baseline to response
time point, t(30) = -2.58, p = .015 (Cohen's d = .18; Cohen,
1992). No differences were found in cortisol levels between
response and recovery, t(30) = -.02, p = .986 time points or
baseline and recovery, t(30) = -1.46, p = .155 time points.
There were no significant main effects for time, F(2, 108) = .69,
p = .485, 
p
2 = .01 or group, F(1, 62) = .01, p = .907, 
p
2 < .001.
See Table 2 for means and standard deviations for cortisol.1
In addition, area under the curve with respect to increase
(AUCi) was also calculated for each group (Pruessner,
Kirschbaum, Meinlschmid, & Hellhammer, 2003). AUCi
assesses baseline-corrected cortisol responses and accounts
for the difference between single measurements from each
other or the change over time (Pruessner et al., 2003). It
should be noted that a negative value represents an index of
decrease rather than an area under the curve. To examine
whether a social-evaluative body image threat elicited a
cortisol response, a one-way ANOVA was conducted using
Table 2. Means (and SDs) for SPA and Cortisol by Group.

group as the independent variable (control, threat) and AUCi
as the dependent variable. The results showed a significant
group difference for AUCi, F(1, 62) = 11.03, p < .01,

p
2 = .15. Inspection of means indicated that the control
group showed an overall decrease (index of decrease) of
-.09 (SD = 0.22), whereas the threat group showed an overall
increase in cortisol of .08 (SD = 0.18).
Discussion
This study compared psychobiological responses with, and
recovery from, actual exposure to a social-evaluative body
image threat in women. Significant increases in social phy-
sique anxiety scores were found in the threat group, with
scores highest immediately following the body composition
assessment. By contrast, the control group showed no changes
in social physique anxiety. Our findings also showed a sig-
nificant group-by-time interaction for cortisol and a signifi-
cant group difference in AUCi indicating that the threat
elicited a cortisol response. These findings are consistent with
our hypotheses that a social-evaluative body image threat
would lead to increased social physique anxiety and cortisol.
Contrary to our hypotheses, social physique anxiety and cor-
tisol returned to baseline levels after the threat was removed;
no significant differences were found between recovery and
baseline levels of social physique anxiety and cortisol.
Implications for Research
Arguably the most significant implication of the present
study is support for examining not only the responses to
social-evaluative body image threats, but also the recovery
from such threats to provide a more complete picture of the
psychobiology of body image experiences. Furthermore, it
should be highlighted that a skinfold assessment elicited a
psychobiological response consistent with SSPT. The find-
ings from the present study complement those of Himmelstein
et al. (2015) from which future research questions can build
and test tenets of SSPT. In agreement with Martin Ginis et al.
(2012), we highlight the challenges of designing an ethical
threat that can be tested in a laboratory setting. Despite the
fact that some information regarding the study was required
to be included in the consent material, we still found signifi-
cant differences in psychobiological outcomes.
Contributions to Body Image Literature
The present findings contribute to the body image literature
in two significant ways. First, they complement those of
Martin Ginis et al. (2012) who found that women who antici-
pated a body image threat had higher cortisol levels post-
manipulation than women in a non-social-evaluative threat
condition. Our findings, in agreement with Himmelstein
et al. (2015), show that actual exposure to a threat resulted in
small but significant increases in cortisol.
More important, to our knowledge, the present study is
the first to measure psychobiological outcomes after the
social-evaluative threat is removed, highlighting the second
contribution to the body image literature. Findings show
that, when faced with a social-evaluative body image threat,
women report an immediate increase in social physique anx-
iety and have higher cortisol, but perhaps more important,
social physique anxiety and cortisol return to baseline levels
when the threat is no longer present. This is an important and
encouraging finding that extends what we currently know
about situations that elicit body image concerns. For exam-
ple, the negative effects of viewing media images of the thin
ideal, a non-social-evaluative body image threat, have been
found to persist 1 to 2 hr after viewing (Hausenblas et al.,
2003). In addition, unlike a self-objectifying situation after
which body-related thoughts persist (Quinn et al., 2006),
quick recovery from a social-evaluative body image threat as
shown in the present study is possible. Although the reasons
for these differences can only be speculated, this finding
could be considered positive for two reasons. First, outcomes
returning to baseline levels after 15 min from a laboratory-
based threat may indicate that women are capable of recover-
ing from a similar acute threat in real life, although
psychobiological responses to a real life body image threat
have yet to be examined. Second, quick, efficient psychobio-
logical responses are adaptive (Gruenewald, Dickerson, &
Kemeny, 2007). Recent evidence examining responses to a
social-evaluative non-body image threat suggests that failing
to examine a recovery phase may lead to erroneous conclu-
sions regarding the distress of the individual (Juster et al.,
2012). In the present study, the quick reactivity and recovery
of social physique anxiety and cortisol may have acted as a
key signaling emotion to make the participant aware that a
social-evaluative threat existed and then passed. However,
caution should be taken in drawing any conclusion about the
temporal quality of this type of response. More research is
needed examining what occurs when the threat is removed.
In addition, potential moderators and mediators of responses
and recovery need to be explored. For example, Himmelstein
et al. (2015) found that perceived weight (regardless of their
actual BMI) was a moderator of cortisol responses to the
weight stigma situation. Findings suggest that perceptions
(and not objective variables) have potential moderating
effects. Variables such as body image coping or body image
investment may be important variables to examine, particu-
larly with respect to efficient recovery.
Limitations
Several limitations to this study should be noted. Results can
only generalize to healthy, young Caucasian adult women.
Furthermore, all but two participants fell within "normal/rec-
ommended" ranges for BMI and percent body fat. As some
examples, results in men or individuals who have a clinical
eating disorder may display different responses as they have
Lamarche et al. 7
different body image concerns. Second, it is important to
note that individuals volunteered for this study, and that all
participants in the threat group went through with the body
composition assessment indicating they were comfortable
enough to have their percent body fat measured. This may
present the issue of demand characteristics within the sam-
ple. We can only speculate why those nine participants ran-
domized into the threat group did not show up to their testing
appointment. However, it should be emphasized that even
though the sample was comfortable enough to complete a
body composition assessment, we still found a significant
increase in social physique anxiety and cortisol in response
to the threat. Future research could minimize self-selection
by withholding study details in recruitment materials
although restrictions do apply based on ethical consider-
ations. Third, our group was relatively active. Research has
provided evidence that exercisers generally have a more
positive body image than non-exercisers (Hausenblas &
Fallon, 2006), yet we were able to elicit a response including
higher social physique anxiety similar to findings reported
by Gammage et al. (2004) in a similar sample.
Also, given that it is not possible to discern which of the
factors of the manipulation was associated with the increase
in cortisol, future research could explore specific contextual
factors and their sole and additive effects on the psychobiol-
ogy of body image experiences. Finally, although timing of
the cortisol measurements in the present study was based on
meta-analytic evidence, it should be noted that this support
comes from studies examining the response to, and recovery
from, a performance-based (and not body image-related)
social-evaluative threat (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004); thus,
timing of the peak response and full recovery may not be the
same across all types of social-evaluative threats.
Another limitation that should be noted relates to the
design of the control group. This challenge is illustrated by
the findings of a significant group-by-time interaction for
cortisol and a significant group difference inAUCi. However,
visual inspection of the mean cortisol values at the response
time point shows that the control group had a higher cortisol
level (although not significantly) than the threat group. We
used a control group to represent a non-threatening condition
with respect to the body, similar to Himmelstein et al. (2015;
rejection but not for weight-related reasons) and to past stud-
ies examining cortisol responses to a social-evaluative non-
body image threat (Kirschbaum et al., 1993; Nater et al.,
2007); however, it was not matched on body image content.
Martin Ginis et al. (2012) noted the difficulty in designing an
equivalent control group when examining cortisol responses
to body image threats. In their second experiment, these
authors had control participants believe they would try on
exercise attire alone, in private. The control and experimen-
tal conditions were matched with respect to content of the
manipulation (about the body), but differed on social evalua-
tion (alone, in private vs. evaluated on fit of clothing by
another person). Objectification theory (Fredrickson &
Roberts, 1997) may highlight the difficulty in designing a
suitable control group in studies comparing groups' varying
level of social-evaluative threat in body image--any study
about body image may initiate self-objectification, leading to
heightened self-conscious outcomes (i.e., body shame).
Research framed in objectification theory has found that
women trying on a swimsuit in front of a mirror (with no one
else present) reported body shame (Fredrickson, Roberts,
Noll, Quinn, & Twenge, 1998). Similarly, Martin Ginis et al.
(2012) noted that trying on clothing may initiate the social
comparison process (which Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004,
reported as one characteristic increasing social evaluation) to
societal body image standards and, therefore, serve as a form
of social evaluation itself leading to slight increases in corti-
sol responses. In turn, this makes it more difficult to detect
differences between the control and threat groups at the
response time point. Although we acknowledge the design of
our control group as a limitation, it should be noted that the
present study did find a significant increase in cortisol, even
with the control group knowing their anthropometric mea-
surements would be taken eventually while wearing shorts
and a t-shirt. Nevertheless, this limitation highlights the chal-
lenges in designing an equivalent body image control condi-
tion void of social evaluation in a research topic with inherent
tendencies for social comparison and/or self-objectification.
Conclusion
The present findings contribute to the body image literature
by providing a more complete understanding of the psycho-
biological aspects of body image. The findings also highlight
the importance of measuring outcomes beyond the time point
immediately after the body image threat is removed to evalu-
ate any lingering effects on psychobiological outcomes.
Furthermore, they emphasize the need to study both anticipa-
tion of a body image threat and actually facing such threats;
it is possible that negative responses that occur in anticipa-
tion of these threats are actually decreased when actually
experiencing such threats (Lamarche et al., 2012; Mills et al.,
2014).

Note
1. A moderation analysis following Baron and Kenny's (1986)
recommendations was conducted to examine the potential
moderating effects of body fat percent, body mass index
(BMI), or body weight on cortisol and social physique anxiety
responses. Results showed no evidence of moderation for body
fat percent, BMI, or weight on cortisol or social physique anxi-
ety responses. These analyses were repeated for cortisol and
social physique anxiety at the recovery time point, and similar
(non-significant) results were found. Furthermore, no signifi-
cant correlations were found between any dependent variable
and BMI or body weight, in addition to body fat percent (all
ps > .05). Moderation analyses for social physique anxiety on
cortisol recovery were also found to be not significant.
