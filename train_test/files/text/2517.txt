Abstract
Objective: To determine the benefits of a mobile health (mHealth) telemonitoring and self-management support
program for diabetes that includes feedback to a patient-selected support person.
Methods: Participants are patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c  7.5%) who nominate a close
friend or adult relative from outside their home ("CarePartner;" CP) who is willing to support their diabetes self-
management. Patients are then randomized to receive one year of usual care alone or the mHealth+CP program. In
the program arm: (a) patients receive weekly automated diabetes telemonitoring calls that include self-management
guidance, (b) their CPs receive emailed updates on the patient's diabetes that include guidance on supporting their
self-management, and (c) their primary care teams receive faxed notifications about medically urgent issues that
they report. Assessments are being performed at Baseline, Month 6, and Month 12. The primary outcomes are 12-
month glycemic control and diabetes distress, and we are also exploring secondary effects upon diabetes self-
management behaviors, health-related quality of life, systolic blood pressure, and relationship quality.
Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the only mHealth intervention for any condition that involves a patients-
selected support person. If it proves effective, then a new, low-cost, sustainable intervention would be available to
improve diabetes outcomes, especially for patient who are medically underserved or socially isolated.

Introduction
Inadequate self-management of blood glucose and blood pressure
among patients with type 2 diabetes are prospectively associated with
chronic hyperglycemia, microvascular complications, and heart
disease [1]. Although care management services can improve these
outcomes [2], these services depend upon the availability of health
professionals to provide between-visit monitoring and patient
education [3]. Mobile health (mHealth) services, including interactive
voice response (IVR) calls in which patients respond to automated
prompts, may help address these barriers to effective care management
[4,5].
Support from informal caregivers also might improve diabetes
outcomes. However, these support persons usually lack formal tools
for monitoring patients' health status and providing as-needed
guidance [6], and they are at risk for burnout due to their caregiving
burden [6,7]. Moreover, many patients live alone, with up to 7 million
Americans receiving "long-distance" caregiving [8]. While some
patients have a geographically-distant support person, these caregivers
usually receive infrequent and insufficiently-detailed updates about the
patient's diabetes health status [9].
In response to these problems, we developed the mHealth system to
automatically provide weekly telemonitoring of diabetes patients. This
service also provides as-needed problem-tailored education to
patients, and notifies their health care teams when patients experience
significant difficulties. Finally, it provides a patient-designated
caregiver (the CarePartner, CP) with structured updates about the
patient's status and as-needed guidance on supporting the patients'
self-management. The results of a six-month patient preference trial
indicate that this system provides clinical information that is reliable,
valid, and actionable [10]. Most scheduled IVR calls were completed,
and attrition rate was only 13%. Importantly, patients became less
likely over time to report: (a) poor medication adherence, (b)
abnormally high or low self-monitored glucose values, and (c)
problems with either monitoring their glucose or checking their feet
[11]. After intervention, improvements were seen in long term
medication adherence, physical functioning, depressive symptoms,
and diabetes specific distress [12]. Finally, among initially
nonadherent patients who opted to involve a CarePartner support
person, adherence was significantly more improved than it was among
those who participated alone [13].

Based on these encouraging preliminary results, we are now
conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our primary
hypothesis is that, relative to usual care alone, the mHealth system
(mHealth+CP) improves the primary outcomes of glycemic control
and diabetes related distress. We will also evaluate its potential benefits
to the secondary outcomes of diabetes self-management, health-
related quality of life, systolic blood pressure, and caregiver
relationships.
Methods
Eligibility and recruitment
In order to participate, patients must: have type 2 DM
(hospitalization or outpatient visit within 12 months for >2 ICD9
codes of 250.XX or therapeutic class codes C4G, C4K, or C4L in past 2
years' problem list), and be in poor glycemic control as indicated by a
recent HbA1c% >7.5%. Additionally, they were required to be  21
years of age; fluent in English, able to use a telephone touchpad; and
able to identify an eligible CP. We exclude patients who are either in
palliative care, on a transplant waitlist, at high risk for 1-year
mortality, as well as those who screen positive for significant cognitive
impairment or an unstable psychiatric condition. Patients are being
identified from four community clinics. We search sites' electronic
health records for patients who meet the first two criteria, and recruit
these patients using an introductory letter followed by telephone
screening to verify their eligibility. We obtain their written informed
consent in person during a research visit to their usual clinic.
Patients are asked to nominate from one to four potential CPs.
They then rate each on a validated measure of social support (Norbeck
Social Support Questionnaire [NSSQ]) [14] to identify the most
supportive nominee for recruitment. (but within the continental US),
communicate regularly with the patient (in person or by phone), have
a working home or mobile telephone number, be able to access to the
internet and communicate via e-mail, be free of psychiatric or
cognitive impairment, be fluent in English, and be  21 years of age.
After they provide verbal informed consent, eligible CPs are mailed
information about the study along with a DVD-based training on
supportive communication. .
Patient assessments
Clinical staff measure glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c, primary
outcome) with the Siemens DCA Vantage Analyzer, which analyzes a
drop of fingertip capillary blood. If an enrolled patient cannot return
to the clinic for follow-up HbA1c testing we use a mail-in testing kit
(CoreMedica Laboratories). All self-report measures are being
administered over the phone by research staff. We measure diabetes
related distress with the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), which has
good evidence of validity and reliability [15]. We measure the quality
of the patient's relationship with their CP by asking patients to report
the frequency of communicating with their CP over the past two
months, and their subjective evaluations of these discussions (feeling
understood, comfort with self-disclosing, confidence in CP's ability to
help, etc.) and perceptions of their CP's caregiving burden and stress
level. Additionally, we are assessing patients' emotional response to
their CP (e.g., appreciation, affection, indebtedness, frustration guilt,
etc), and the content of discussions with their CP (DM self-
management, medication use, appointment keeping, and other DM-
related behavioral goals). We measure general physical and mental
functioning with the Medical Outcome Study 12-Item Short Form
(SF-12) [16], which is reliable and has been validated for use with
diabetes patients [17]. From SF-12 data we calculate the Physical
Composite Score (PCS) and Mental Composite Score (MCS) for
analysis as secondary outcomes. We are measuring the frequency of
diabetes self-management behaviors (healthy eating, exercise, and
glucose testing) with the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities
(SDSCA) [18]. Evidence indicates its reliability, sensitivity to change,
and convergence with other behavioral measures [18,19]. We assess
medication adherence with the Brief Medication Questionnaire
(BMQ) [16], which is 80-100% sensitive to repeat dose skipping and
90% sensitive to sporadic skipping [19], together with the reliable and
well-validated Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) [20,21].
We measure the supportiveness of the CP using the Norbeck Social
Support Questionnaire (described above) [14]. We measure depressive
symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) [22].
Health literacy is being assessed by the Test of Functional Health
Literacy (Adults) [23]. Finally, we are using standard items to measure
patients' age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, level of education,
and yearly household income. All of these measures are administered
at baseline, Month 6, and Month 12, except that sociodemographic
data are collected only at Baseline.
Caregiver assessments
We are using single items to assess type and frequency of
interactions with the patient and between the CP and any in-home
informal caregivers. Portions of the Picot Rewards Scale [24] and
Caregiver Reciprocity Scale [25] are being used to assess frustration,
respect, and conflict resolution. Caregiver relationship quality and
support self-efficacy are assessed among caregivers by rewording
selected items from the patient measures. We measure caregiver
burden using the Modified Caregiver Strain Index, which has good
reliability and validity [26]. Following the methods of Langa et al., [27]
we calculate caregiving opportunity costs using selected items from the
Chronic Illness and Caregiving Survey [28].
Ancillary data sources
We measure outpatient services, hospitalizations, and medication
use from site-specific administrative databases and patient self-report
over six-month periods, from which we can estimate costs.
Intervention costs include the costs of research personnel, supplies,
overhead expenses and training costs. Facility based data are being
used to estimate overhead costs, capital expenditures and telephone
charges. Medical comorbidity will be measured from patients' problem
lists using Deyo's modified Charlson Comorbidity Index [29].
Telephone contact between patients and clinicians is quantified from
records and online logs. Our automated calling system provides data
on the outcomes of automated call attempts, e-mails, alerts, logins, and
postings.
Randomization
After baseline assessment, we randomize patient-CP pairs to
intervention (mHealth+CP) or usual care, with a 1:1 allocation ratio
based upon permuted blocking by clinical site.
mHealth+CP intervention arm
During each week that an IVR call is scheduled, the system makes
up to three attempts to contact each patient on up to three different
patient-selected day/time combinations (i.e., up to nine attempts per

week). Calls follow tree-structured algorithms and last between 5 and
10 minutes, during which patients respond to questions about the past
week (using their telephone touchtone keypad) and hear messages that
give self-management messages based on the patient's responses. The
content of questions and feedback messages was developed with input
from experts on diabetes self-management, primary care services, and
mHealth service design. Queries focus on symptoms of hypoglycemia
and hyperglycemia, performance of fasting self-monitoring of blood
glucose (SMBG), any SMBG results <90 mg/dL, hypoglycemia self-
treatment, three or more instances of SMBG in the prior week with
results > 300 mg/dL, possession of at least a two-week supply of
antihypergycemic medication, adherence to antihyperglycemic
medication, and foot inspection. If patients report difficulty in any of
these areas, the system provides them with pre-recorded self-
management education specific to that issue. Even if patients do not
report any problems, they can still opt to hear self-management
educational messages on healthy eating, physical activity, and
medication adherence. Further details on the content of IVR calls are
available from the authors.
After each completed call, patients' CarePartners are automatically
emailed a summary of the patients' call. If the patient reported self-
management problems during the call, then the report includes an
explanation, structured suggestions for how to support the patient's
self-management, and an appropriate timeframe for interacting with
the patient.
Whenever patients report a pattern of either abnormal blood
glucose, abnormal blood pressure, or significant medication
nonadherence, the system automatically faxes a notification to their
primary care team. The thresholds for triggering notifications were
selected with clinician input to have a low false positive rate, provide
actionable information, and efficiently use human resources for
follow-up without burdening clinicians. Finally, the calling system
records detailed process data such as the outcome of each attempted
call which research staff monitor to ensure treatment delivery and
participant engagement.
Ethical approval and public registration
This study was approved by Institutional Review Board at the
University of Michigan, and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT01684709).
Data analysis
Power and sample size: For our main hypothesis, we predict a mean
difference of -0.3% (95% c.i.: -0.5 ­ -0.1, p=0.007) in 12-month HbA1c,
which is the mean impact of long-term educational and behavioral
interventions for poorly-controlled DM per a 2009 Cochrane's Review
[30]. Per our previously published data [31], we assume a pooled
standard deviation (SD) of 1.72 and a 1-year within-subject correlation
of 0.78. We also assume that mean baseline HbA1c will be 8.5% in
both groups, and anticipate this to drop 0.3% in the intervention arm
by Month 6 and be maintained at that reduced level at Month 12.
Based upon a two-time repeated measures analysis at alpha=0.025 to
adjust for two comparisons (Baseline vs. Month 6, and Baseline vs.
Month 12), and assuming that controls' HbA1c will remain constant at
Months 6 and 12, we estimate that 190 subjects are required per arm to
provide 80% power to detect a group by time interaction. Assuming up
to 40% attrition, we are enrolling up to 480 patients (and 480 CPs)
total in order to achieve our necessary sample size.
Missing data: The primary analysis will use only observed data,
whereas auxiliary analyses include imputed missing data. We will use
logistic regression to model the likelihood of missing data, define
strata in which values are missing at random, classify patients using
propensities, randomly sample from observed distributions, and
impute missing data.
Preliminary data analysis: We will test baseline differences in
HbA1c, DDS, age, race, gender, etc., and adjust subsequent analyses
accordingly. We will check the validity of IVR data against
corresponding self-report measures. Depending on the results of these
checks, we will report significant discrepancies and might adjust
analyses for extreme cases and/or measurement error, derive validity
weights, impute modeled values or drop specific variables.
Hypothesis testing analysis: We will use a linear mixed-model
analysis to model HbA1c and DDS scores as a function of group
(mHealth+CP vs. control) and time (Baseline, 6 months, 12 months).
We plan to interpret significant group X time interactions by plotting
regression lines above and below the moderator median [32].
Adjustments will be made for potential confounders including design
factors (e.g., site, presence of in-home caregiver) and baseline
characteristics. We will use random intercepts to account for
clustering within time and site. Likelihood ratio tests will be used to
evaluate nested models. Alternative covariance structures will be
evaluated using residuals and information criteria statistics. We will
use the same approach to evaluate whether mHealth+CP improves the
secondary outcomes of diabetes self-management, health-related
quality of life, systolic blood pressure, and caregiver relationships.
Results
We began recruiting patients in March 2013. To date, we have
recruited approximately 130 patient-participants (along with 130 of
their CPs), which is 27% of our targeted sample. Twenty-four
participants have completed their Month 12 assessment. We are
scheduled to perform interim analyses in May of 2015. Given our
current recruitment rate, we project that the study will be closed to
new accrual by March 2016, and that data collection will be completed
by March 2017.
Discussion
As described above, we are conducting an RCT in community
clinics to determine the benefits of a mHealth diabetes telemonitoring
and self-management program that includes a patient-selected support
person. The intervention is designed to: (a) monitor patients'
symptoms and self-management problems, (b) provide patients with
tailored messages about diabetes self-management and medical help-
seeking, (c) generate guidance on self-management support for
patients' informal caregivers via structured emails, and (d) provide
patients' clinicians with actionable feedback via faxed updates about
selected patient-reported health and self-care problems [33].
In typical outpatient care, patients seldom receive corrective
guidance until long after any poor self-management patterns have
resulted in negative medical consequences. This temporal lag is a
major barrier to behavior change, and can render medical
interventions ineffective. Accordingly, the design of our mHealth
program is grounded in the assumption that informal caregivers and
healthcare teams will use problem-tailored advice to address emerging
problems before they escalate, and prophylactically help the patient to
improve their illness self-management behaviors. Automated data

collection is also a key strategy in our model, because it provides
routine "asynchronous communication" between the patient and
others that does not require their simultaneous availability. Because
patients' supporters usually also juggle demands from their workplace,
young children, and other sources [34], this flexibility should enhance
the intervention's translatability, uptake, and maintenance.
Potential limitations
One noteworthy study limitation might be our inability to isolate
the unique additive effect of having a CarePartner above and beyond
the well-documented effects of telemonitoring alone. While an
"mHealth alone" condition (without a Care Partner) would have
provided this comparison, we have already studied this variation and
concluded that having a CP probably improves telemonitoring
outcomes [10-13]. Therefore, our main objective was to test the
clinical effectiveness of the aggregated mHealth+CP package rather
than determine the efficacy of its subcomponents.
A second potential limitation is that most of the variables are being
measured by self-report which is prone to recall and social desirability
report biases. However, we have previously established that the
intervention provides information that is reliable and valid [35].
Moreover, most of the self-report instruments being used have strong
psychometric characteristics, and three of our outcomes (blood
glucose, blood pressure, and health care costs) are being assessed
objectively. While attrition is often a concern in clinical research, we
do not expect substantial dropout. We believe that attrition is being
minimized by the general patient-centeredness of the calling system
and its scripts. Patient engagement is probably also enhanced by
scheduling the calls at each patient's preferred times and making up to
nine calling attempts per week if needed.
Anticipated implications
To our knowledge, this is the only mHealth intervention that
involves a patient-selected support person. Although we project only
small to moderate effect magnitudes, the intervention is probably
inexpensive to implement, given that the majority of its costs are
attributable to development and testing. Therefore, if this approach
proves effective, then an innovative and sustainable new intervention
could potentially be made widely available. Its benefits might include
not only improved self-management and medication adherence, but
also long term improvements in glycemic control, functional
impairment and psychological distress. In sum, this research could
ultimately lead to major public health benefits, especially for
vulnerable and isolated patients.
