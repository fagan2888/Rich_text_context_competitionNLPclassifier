Introduction
Bullying in schools has been identified as a serious problem
plaguing school students worldwide (Jimerson, Swearer, &
Espelage, 2010). Significant research attention has been
directed toward identifying risk factors for bullying and vic-
timization, thus we can now sketch a fairly accurate profile
of the characteristics of perpetrators and victims of school
bullying (Cook, Williams, Guerra, Kim, & Sadek, 2010).
However, given that protective and promotive factors also
play an important role in the etiology and the developmental
course of adolescent problem behavior, scientific attention
should be broadened beyond its traditional preoccupation
with risk factors to encompass protective and promotive fac-
tors as well (Jessor, Van Den Bos, Vanderryn, Costa, &
Turbin, 1995), so as to inform school bullying prevention
strategies for adolescents to aim to reduce the risks and
strengthen the protective factors (Ttofi & Farrington, 2012).
Future orientation, which refers to an individual's
thoughts, plans, motivations, and feelings about his or her
future (Nurmi, 1991), has been identified as a protective and
promotive factor for adolescents. Nurmi (1991) pointed out
that adolescents who are not oriented toward the future may
engage in a variety of problem behaviors, such as delin-
quency, problems in school or drug use. Research has pro-
vided evidence of the association between future orientation
and a wide range of problem behaviors (Bolland, 2003;
Oyserman & Saltz, 1993; Robbins & Bryan, 2004; Stoddard,
Zimmerman, & Bauermeister, 2011). However, the link
between future orientation and school bullying has not been
examined. In addition, no research has tested the mediating
effect of school bonding on the relation between future ori-
entation and school bullying behavior. Therefore, in the pres-
ent study, we aim to examine the relationship between future
orientation and school bullying, and to examine the mediat-
ing effect of school bonding on the future orientation--
school bullying behavior link.
In adolescence, future orientation is an important issue
worthy of further research. First, the subjective sense of
future time plays an essential role in student or human moti-
vation (Carstensen, 2006; Husman & Lens, 1999). Second,
adolescence is a time of identity development, exploration,
and commitment (Erikson, 1950). Third, motivational fac-
tors are more malleable than individual demographic factors

Future Orientation and School Bullying
Among Adolescents in Rural China: The
Mediating Role of School Bonding
Shu Ling Gao1 and Ko Ling Chan1
Abstract
This study examined the relations among future orientation, school bonding, and school bullying perpetration behaviors.
Data were collected from 677 seventh- to ninth-grade adolescents in an area in Southwest China. Specifically, students
completed the Future-Orientation Questionnaire, the Psychological Sense of School Membership scale, and the Revised
Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire to assess their future orientation, school bonding, and bullying behaviors, respectively.
Results indicated that students' future orientation (toward education or occupation) was negatively associated with school
bullying perpetration. Future orientation was also significantly associated with their feeling of school bonding. School bonding
had a significant indirect effect (b = .37) on the relation between future orientation in the educational domain and school
bullying behavior, and also played a significant mediating role in the relation between future orientation in the occupational
domain and school bullying perpetration (b = .30). This research suggests that school bonding may be one mechanism by
which children's orientation toward future education or future occupation may have an effect on their bullying perpetration
behaviors.

Future Orientation and Bullying Behaviors
Adolescence is a critical "turning point" in the life course,
during which adolescents make important choices that will
have an impact on their future (Quinton, Pickles, Maughan,
& Rutter, 1993). Future orientation is an issue that becomes
critical as children approach adolescence, during which time
it is rapidly developing, differentiating, and expanding
(Greene, 1986). Future plans become increasingly detailed,
and adolescents begin to make more realistic evaluations of
their ability to reach future goals. Seginer (2009) reviewed
previous work on future orientation and summarized the
aspects of future orientation that may have motivating effects
on behaviors, namely, the perceived value of future events,
the expected possibilities of achieving future goals, and the
evaluation of one's control over goal attainment. On the
basis of these considerations, individuals direct their devel-
opment in certain ways and purposefully select a variety of
life trajectories (Nurmi, 1993). That is to say that if adoles-
cents consider a positive future that is important, achievable,
and controllable, they would be expected to devote them-
selves to activities that help them reach that vision of their
future; whereas a low level of future orientation may influ-
ence the decision-making process of engaging in problem
behaviors (P. Chen & Vazsonyi, 2011).
There are a number of studies showing that future orienta-
tion is inversely related to several kinds of problem behav-
iors, including theft (Oyserman & Saltz, 1993), general
delinquency (Skorikov & Vondracek, 2007), school miscon-
duct (Oyserman, Bybee, & Terry, 2006), and violent behav-
ior (P. Chen & Vazsonyi, 2011; Stoddard et al., 2011). No
research, however, has established whether future orienta-
tion is negatively associated with school bullying.
Accordingly, the first aim of the present study was to exam-
ine the relation between future orientation and bullying
behavior.
The Mediating Effect of School Bonding
School bonding is argued to be particularly important for
adolescents as they rely less on family as part of the individu-
ation process and come to rely more on extrafamilial rela-
tionships, such as those found in schools, with friends, and
others (Goodenow, 1993). Researchers have not yet reached
consensus about the definition of school bonding. In the cur-
rent study, to define school bonding, we adopted Goodenow's
(1993) definition of psychological school membership,
which refers to "the extent to which students feel personally
accepted, respected, included, and supported by others in the
school social environment" (p. 80). Empirical studies have
documented that students' school bonding is negatively
related to a number of conduct problems, aggression, and
violent behaviors (Chapman, Buckley, Sheehan, Shochet, &
Romaniuk, 2011; Loukas, Ripperger-Suhler, & Horton,
2009; Maddox & Prinz, 2003; Resnick et al., 1997). For
instance, Maddox and Prinz (2003) found that school bond-
ing is linked to delinquency and antisocial behavior.
However, the relationship between school bonding and
school bullying remains unclear. Therefore, in the current
study, it is expected that school bonding is negatively associ-
ated with bullying behavior. In addition, previous research
reported gender differences in bullying behaviors (Atik &
Guneri, 2013; L. M. Chen & Cheng, 2013; Zhou et al., 2013),
thus the effect of gender on bullying should be tested.
Studies of the antecedents of school bonding have prolif-
erated, but many have either focused on individual character-
istics, such as age, gender, physical attractiveness, family
structure, and academic performance (Thompson, Iachan,
Overpeck, Ross, & Gross, 2006), emotional problems
(Waters, Cross, & Shaw, 2010b), and coping styles
(Frydenberg, Care, Freeman, & Chan, 2009), or focused on
school ecology factors (McNeely, Nonnemaker, & Blum,
2002; Thompson et al., 2006; Waters, Cross, & Shaw, 2010a;
Whitlock, 2006; Yuen et al., 2012). There has been a lack of
attention to individual motivational factors, such as future
orientation.
Multiple studies have shown that being future-oriented is
associated with several optimal school outcomes. For
instance, future-oriented students have been found to regu-
late their study behavior (Bilde, Vansteenkiste, & Lens,
2011), to be more strongly engaged in their schoolwork, to
spend more time studying (Horstmanshof & Zimitat, 2007),
to manage their time more efficiently, to display less procras-
tination (Harber, Zimbardo, & Boyd, 2003; Jackson, Fritch,
Nagasaka, & Pope, 2003), to persevere with their school-
work, and they also derive a greater sense of satisfaction
from studying (Zaleski, 1987). Although there is no direct
evidence showing that future orientation is associated with
school bonding, much indirect pieces of evidence hint that
future orientation may be positively related to school bond-
ing. Based on these findings, in the present study it is antici-
pated that future orientation be positively associated with
school bonding. It is important to note that prior research
reported age and gender differences of future orientation
(Lamm, Schmidt, & Trommsdorff, 1976; Steinberg et al.,
2009), therefore the effects of gender and age (or grade) on
future orientation should be tested.
Now the last but most important hypothesis has also
emerged. Specifically, in the above section, we hypothesized
that future orientation is negatively related to school bullying
behaviors; in the current section, we have hypothesized that
future orientation is positively associated with school bond-
ing, which is, in turn, negatively related to bullying behav-
iors. Then, does school bonding have a mediating effect on
the relation between future orientation and school bullying
behaviors? Thus, in the current study, school bonding is
anticipated to have a mediating effect on the relation between
future orientation and school bullying.

Theoretical Foundations
A social exchange perspective can be applied to explain bul-
lying behavior by weighing the costs, rewards, and alterna-
tives for its perpetrators. A social exchange framework posits
that much of human relationships are formed by the use of a
subjective cost­benefit analysis and the comparison of alter-
natives (Homans, 1958, 1974; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959).
Bullying is probably rewarding for perpetrators. For instance,
they can obtain power, social dominance, or high-status
group affiliation through bullying (Olthof, Goossens,
Vermande, Aleva, & Meulen, 2011; Salmivalli, 2010). There
are two kinds of standard or criterion to evaluate the accept-
ability of outcomes in an exchange relationship: comparison
level (CL) that determines whether the exchange meets the
individual's expectations, and CL for alternatives (or CL
alt
)
that determines whether the current outcome exceeds the
individual's other alternatives (Thibaut & Kelley, 1959). In
adolescence, with the rapid development of future orienta-
tion (Greene, 1986), adolescents have more alternatives to
meet their needs and achieve their goals, such as through
commitment to future education or occupation to gain social
status or power. These alternatives may be more cost-effec-
tive than bullying in the long run. Therefore, adolescents
who develop high-level future orientation may less likely
engage in bullying, whereas those who have a low level of
future orientation may pursue immediate gratification by
engaging in bullying.
Purpose of Study
Using a cross-sectional research design among adolescents
in rural China, the current research aimed to examine future
orientation as a motivator enhancing students' sense of
school bonding, which, in turn, negatively relates to bullying
behavior.
Specifically, four central questions guided this research:
Research Question 1: Does adolescents' future orienta-
tion predict their bullying behaviors?
Research Question 2: Does adolescents' future orienta-
tion predict their sense of school bonding?
Research Question 3: Does adolescents' school bonding
predict school bullying behavior?
Research Question 4: Does adolescents' school bonding
mediate the effect of future orientation on bullying
behavior?
Method
Participants
Participants were 677 students from one rural middle school
located in Southwest China. Of this total, 375 (55.4%) were
girls, 238 (35.2%) were seventh graders, and 271 (40.0%)
and 168 (24.8%) were eighth and ninth graders, respectively.
Participants ranged in age from 12 to 17 years, with a mean
age of 14.37.
Procedures
Approval for this research was obtained from the University
Human Research Ethics Committee prior to data collection.
Data were collected in spring 2013 through anonymous self-
report questionnaires distributed in the regular classroom by
the researcher and teachers. Information about the purpose of
the survey and confidentiality of responses was clearly
explained. Parent or guardian permission and student assent
were obtained. Students completed the questionnaires during
class time. The children did not receive compensation for
their participation in the study.
Measures
Background variables. Students were asked to provide demo-
graphic information, including age, gender, grade, and
whether they were left behind or not.
Bullying perpetration.Bullying perpetration was assessed
using the Chinese version of the Revised Olweus Bully/Vic-
tim Questionnaire (OBVQ-R; W. X. Zhang, Wu, & Jones,
1999). Seven items were presented asking about specific
forms of behaviors associated with bullying others. These
seven questions referred to the four forms of bullying perpe-
tration: verbal, physical, social, and other forms of bullying
others. Example items include "I called mean names, made
fun of, or teased others in a hurtful way," and "I hit, kicked,
pushed, shoved around, or locked others indoors." Partici-
pants were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert-type scale
ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (several times a week). Total
scores were calculated by summing across items. The range
of total scores thus ran from 0 to 28. The Cronbach's alpha
coefficient for the seven-item scale was .81 (W. X. Zhang
et al., 1999) and .71 in the present study.
Future orientation. The Exploration and Commitment Ques-
tionnaire (Nurmi, Seginer, & Poole, 1990) was used to mea-
sure the levels of exploration and commitment separately in
three domains of future life: education, occupation, and fam-
ily. Exploration for education, occupation, or family was
assessed by asking three questions, respectively, concerning
the extent to which the participants had sought information
and planned for this domain of their lives (e.g., "How often
do you think about your studies and plan your future educa-
tion?"). The participants respond to the questions on a 5-point
Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (daily). Cron-
bach's alpha reliabilities for explorations concerning future
education, occupation, and family were .73, .74, and .79,
respectively (Nurmi, Poole, & Kalakoski, 1996).
Commitment related to education, occupation, or family
was assessed by asking four questions, respectively, con-
cerning the extent to which the participants were committed
4 SAGE Open
to their decisions in this domain of their life, and the extent
to which they had already realized their plans (e.g., "How
determined are you to fulfill your plans about your future
education after middle school?"). The participants responded
to the questions on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from
1 (definitely not) to 5 (definitely yes). Cronbach's alpha reli-
abilities for the scores measuring commitment to decisions
concerning future education, occupation, and family were
.60, .62, and .61, respectively (Nurmi et al., 1996).
The Chinese version of the Exploration and Commitment
Questionnaire was revised by L. L. Zhang, Zhang, Ji, and
Nurmi (2006). Cronbach's alpha reliabilities for explorations
concerning future education, occupation, and family were
.53, .66, and .76, respectively. Cronbach's alpha reliabilities
for the scores measuring commitment to decisions concern-
ing future education, occupation, and family were .59, .56,
and .68, respectively.
In the current study, we only chose the subscale of explo-
rations concerning future education and occupation, and
commitment to decisions concerning future education and
occupation. In this study, Cronbach's alpha reliabilities for
explorations concerning future education and occupation
were .55 and .66, respectively; Cronbach's alpha reliabilities
for the scores measuring commitment to decisions concern-
ing future education and occupation were .59 and .58, respec-
tively. Cronbach's alpha reliability for the whole future
orientation scale was .84.
School bonding. It was assessed with the Psychological Sense
of School Membership (PSSM) scale (Goodenow, 1993).
The Chinese version of the PSSM is an 18-item measure
using a 6-point Likert-type scale response format ranging
from 1 (not at all true) to 6 (completely true; Cheung & Hui,
2003). This scale assesses the extent to which students feel a
sense of belonging (e.g., "I feel like a real part of this
school"), respect (e.g., "I am treated with as much respect as
other students"), encouragement (e.g., "People here know I
can do good work"), and acceptance and inclusion (e.g., "I
am included in lots of activities at this school"). Goodenow
(1993) reported that in two studies with suburban students,
internal reliability was .88. Scores on the PSSM correlated
significantly with teacher-rated social standing and with stu-
dent self-reported motivation, grades, and teacher-rated stu-
dent effort (Goodenow, 1993). The internal consistency of
this measure for the present sample was  = .83.
Results
Analysis Overview
Research questions were addressed with structural equation
modeling using Mplus Version 6.1 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-
2010). Missing data were dealt with listwise deletion. Models
were estimated separately for the educational and occupa-
tional domain of future orientation. That is, we established
two models: In Model 1, there were three variables--future
educational orientation (independent variable), school bond-
ing (mediator), and bullying behavior (dependent variable);
in Model 2, there were three variables--future occupational
orientation (independent variable), school bonding (media-
tor), and bullying behavior (dependent variable). Model fit
was evaluated based on the chi-square test statistic, the com-
parative fit index (CFI), the root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean
square residual (SRMR). Guidelines suggest that CFI values
greater than .95, RMSEA less than .06, and SRMR less than
.08 indicate good model fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
Gender Differences in Future Orientation, School
Bonding, and School Bullying
Independent-samples t test analyses indicated that there were
no significant differences in scores for males and females in
school bonding, t(675) = 0.05, p = .96; however, there were
significant differences in scores in bullying, t(675) = 6.31,
p < .001, in educational future orientation, t(675) = -3.28,
p < .01, and in occupational future orientation, t(675) =
-2.19, p < .05.
Grade Differences in Future Orientation, School
Bonding, and School Bullying
One-way ANOVA analyses showed a statistically significant
difference in future occupational orientation scores for three
grade groups, F(2, 674) = 4.94, p < .01. However, there were
no statistical differences in future educational orientation,
F(2, 674) = 0.81, p = .44, school bonding, F(2, 674) = 0.54,
p = .59, and bullying scores, F(2, 674) = 0.56, p = .57, for
three grade groups. Therefore, gender and grade were con-
trolled in subsequent structural equation modeling analyses.
Descriptive Statistics
Intercorrelations, means, standard deviations, skewness, and
kurtosis for the 10 observed variables are presented in Table
1. The kurtosis values of the four variables of the school bul-
lying perpetration scale were greater than 0, indicating that
the univariate distributions of variables were not normal
which can lead to multivariate abnormality, thus the more
robust maximum likelihood mean adjusted (MLM) estimator
was used for data analysis in the present study rather than
ML which is based on data normality (Byrne, 2012).
Correlations, covariances, variances, means, and standard
deviations for latent variables are presented in Table 2.
Structural Equation Modeling Analysis
Measurement model. All the measured variables significantly
loaded on the latent variables (all p < .001; see Table 3). A
test of the measurement model showed a good fit to the data
(see Table 3).
Gao and Chan 5
Structural model. The structural model of total effect of future
educational (or occupational) orientation on school bullying
perpetration fits the data well (see Table 4). The proposed
mediation model with the indirect pathway of future educa-
tional (or occupational) orientation on school bullying
through school bonding demonstrated a good fit with the data
(see Table 4). There was a significant and negative indirect
effect ( = -.37, p < .05) in Model 1(see Table 5); to estimate
the effect size of the mediation effect in Model 1, the method
of Preacher and Kelley (2011) was used: ab·Sx / Sy = (-.37)
0.61 / 2.04 = -.11, indicating that bullying perpetration
decreases by 0.11 standard deviations for every 1 SD increase
in education future orientation indirectly via school bonding.
Similarly, there was a significant and negative indirect effect
( = -.30, p < .05) in Model 2 (see Table 5); the effect size of
the mediation effect in Model 2 is ab·Sx / Sy = (-.30) 0.62 /
2.04 = -.09, indicating that bullying perpetration decreases
by 0.09 standard deviations for every 1 SD increase in occu-
pation future orientation indirectly via school bonding. It is
also important to note that future education orientation
accounted for 44% of the variance in school bonding (p <
.001); in turn, future education orientation and school bond-
ing explained 26% of the variance in bullying perpetration (p
< .01). Similarly, future occupation orientation accounted for
36% of the variance in school bonding (p < .001); in turn,
future occupation orientation and school bonding explained
24% of the variance in bullying perpetration (p < .01).
Discussion
This research examined relations among future orientation,
school bonding, and school bullying perpetration behaviors
among a sample of adolescents in rural China. Four hypothe-
ses were all supported. Specifically, future orientation is nega-
tively associated with school bullying perpetration behaviors;
future orientation is positively related to school bonding;
school bonding is negatively associated with school bullying
perpetration behaviors; and school bonding mediates the

relationship between future orientation and school bullying
perpetration behaviors.
This study built on prior research in several ways. First, it
has demonstrated that adolescents' future orientation in both
the educational and occupational domains is associated with
diminished bullying behaviors, suggesting that such motiva-
tion may be beneficial for reducing bullying behavior. This
finding is in accord with previous related studies, which
reported that future orientation is inversely related to school
misconduct (Oyserman et al., 2006; Skorikov & Vondracek,
2007). Second, in the current study the hypothesis that future
orientation is related to school bonding was supported. Third,
the current research found that students' feelings of bonding
to their school were significantly related to fewer bullying
behaviors. This finding is consistent with previous research
(Loukas et al., 2009), which found that adolescents' feelings
of school bonding predicted lower levels of conduct prob-
lems and physical aggression. Moreover, the results of the
mediation models supported the notion that children's future
orientation (whether in the educational or occupational
domain) has significant mediating effects on their bullying
behaviors through school bonding. This finding corroborated
and extended previous research (Bilde et al., 2011; Chapman
et al., 2011; Loukas et al., 2009), which only examined the
relation between future orientation and school activities, or
the relation between school bonding and problem
behaviors.
Limitations and Strengths
It is important to note limitations when interpreting these
results. First, due to limited research resources (e.g., research
fund), we can only conduct cross-sectional study using con-
venient sampling and only collect self-report data. However,
reliance on exclusively self-reported data raises the issue of
social desirability and recall biases, which may inflate or
deflate correlations. Further research would benefit from a
multirate­multimethod design, such as using teacher-, self-,
and peer report simultaneously in one study. Furthermore,
this study was exploratory in nature, and cross-validation is
therefore needed to address potential issues with sample
dependency. Given that social class (McLoyd, Kaplan,
Purtell, & Huston, 2011) and culture (Sundberg, Poole, &
Tyler, 1983) can also influence adolescents' future orienta-
tion, further research with a large and representative sample
is necessary to examine whether adolescents' future orienta-
tion is related to their bullying behavior through a sense of
school bonding. Another limitation of the present study is
that, as the data were collected concurrently, it would be
inappropriate to make statements (however tentative) about
the causal direction of effect. Future longitudinal research
would provide an insight into the direction of these effects.
Despite these limitations, this study has a number of
strengths. It is the first to apply a social exchange framework
to explain bullying behavior, and to incorporate a social

exchange framework into future orientation to explain the
developmental nature of adolescent bullying. For instance,
previous research found that school bullying behaviors peak
in middle school and decline in high school (Williams &
Guerra, 2007). According to social exchange perspective,
this may be because adolescent bullies become more focused
at this stage on planning and achieving future goals for a
delayed gratification (Trommsdorff, Lamm, & Schmidt,
1979). Another strength is the examination of the role of
future orientation in conjunction with school bonding and
bullying behavior, which focused on protective factors rather
than on the risk factors of bullying. Focusing on protective
factors and building the resilience of children at risk may be
a more positive approach and more attractive to
communities.
Implications
By providing evidence of protective factors in reducing bul-
lying behavior, this study can inform bullying agencies to
adopt a protective factor focused on a prevention and inter-
vention approach as their framework to guide new antibully-
ing initiatives. First, the results of this study indicate that one
possible way to reduce bullying is to enhance adolescent bul-
lies' future orientation. If they plan and commit to a valued,
achievable, and controllable future goal, they might become
less involved in bullying behavior. School psychologists
should help students find their valued, achievable, and con-
trollable future goal, and help them achieve it. Second, it is
important for school psychologists to inform and educate
teachers, administrators, and staff on the role school bonding
plays in contributing to diminished bullying behavior. This
study also indicates that students'heightening future orienta-
tion could increase their level of school bonding. Other
evidence for strategies to improve school bonding is also
emerging, such as mentoring (Karcher, 2005; King,Vidourek,
Davis, & McClellan, 2002).
Conclusion
This study represents a first step in understanding relations
among future orientation, school bonding, and school bully-
ing perpetration behaviors. A conceptual mediation model
with four hypotheses was tested, wherein school bonding
mediated the relationship between future orientation and
school bullying perpetration. The findings generally sup-
ported our proposed model, and four hypotheses were
supported.
