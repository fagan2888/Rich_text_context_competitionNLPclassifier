Introduction
Modern neuroscience has shown that emotions permeate
both mind and body and can affect our susceptibility to
stress, cognitive function, and vulnerability to particular
psychiatric disorders and illnesses. Emotions can also affect
the function of our respiratory, immune, cardiovascular,
reproductive, endocrine and gastrointestinal (GI) systems
(Davidson, 2013). Research in epigenetics further supports
the idea that our beliefs and emotions translate into physi-
ological changes in the body (Church, 2009; Lipton, 2008),
and this mind­body connection is apparent in sufferers of
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
IBS affects approximately 15
per cent of the general
population at any one time and is one of the most common
disorders encountered by both gastroenterologists and phy-
sicians in primary care (Camilleri and Choi, 1997; Farthing,
1995). The disorder typically affects those of working age
and imposes an economic burden on the patient through
increased health-care costs and loss of income because of
illness (Dean et al., 2005). These patients also often experi-
ence a decrease in quality of life (Creed et al., 2000).
The aetiology of IBS is as yet unknown, but most
researchers agree that a subset of IBS sufferers have vis-
ceral hypersensitivity of the gut (Bouchoucha et al., 1999;
Camilleri et al., 2001). Other possible mechanisms in pre-
disposed persons that have been proposed include previ-
ous infectious gastroenteritis, mast cell infiltration, an
imbalance of neurotransmitters including serotonin dys-
regulation, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and psy-
chological precipitants including acute life stress and
abuse (Gershon, 2004; Gui, 1998; Koloski et al., 2005;
Levy et al., 1997; Neal et al., 1997; Pimentel et al., 2000).
Hence, IBS is probably a multi-faceted brain­gut disorder
The mind­body connection in irritable
bowel syndrome: A randomised controlled
trial of hypnotherapy as a treatment

Abstract
Background: Hypnotherapy has been reported as being beneficial in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
We aimed to test the hypothesis that patients with IBS treated `holistically' by hypnosis (i.e. by combined psychological
and physiological symptom imagery) would have greater improvement in their IBS symptoms than patients treated
by hypnosis using standard `gut-directed' hypnotherapy, and both would be superior to simple relaxation therapy.
Methods: Patients (n=51) with Rome II criteria were randomised to `individualised' (holistic) hypnotherapy, standard
`gut-directed' hypnotherapy or relaxation therapy for a period of 11weeks with two follow-up assessments at 2weeks
and at 3
months after the completion of the trial. The primary outcome was bowel symptom severity scale (BSSS).
Results: All the participants in this study improved their IBS symptoms (pain, bloating, constipation and diarrhoea) and
physical functioning at the end of the treatment from baseline, but this was not significantly different across the treatment
arms. Conclusion: Neither `individualised' nor `gut-directed' hypnotherapy is superior to relaxation therapy in IBS.

Report of empirical study
2 Health Psychology Open 
resulting in alteration in the regulation of gastrointestinal
(GI) motility and/or sensory function (Smith and Morton,
2001; Tortora and Grabowski, 2000). Studies have shown
that emotions such as anger, fear, pain and anxiety affect
colonic motility more in IBS patients than in healthy con-
trols (Gorard et al., 1996; Welgan et al., 2000), and for
IBS, the most frequent co-morbid psychiatric disorders
are anxiety, depression and somatoform disorders (Creed,
1992, 1994).
This evidence suggests that the pathophysiology of IBS
involves the brain­gut axis (Salt and Neimark, 2002), and
`gut-directed' hypnotherapy has been shown to be a suc-
cessful intervention in breaking abnormal cycles occurring
within this axis (Camilleri, 2001; Farhadi et al., 2001).
Studies have especially shown the efficacy of hypnosis in
the treatment of IBS (Palsson, 1998; Whorwell, 1987,
2006), but these studies only addressed physiological
symptoms (`gut-directed' hypnotherapy) and did not take
into account psychological symptoms such as anxiety and
depression which are part of the IBS symptom picture.
The mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic suc-
cess of hypnotherapy are largely unknown, but research
has shown that it may act by modulating visceral sensitiv-
ity, motor function and psychological distress (Gruzelier
et al., 2001; Houghton et al., 1999; Marchioro et al.,
2000). Imagery is a major component of hypnosis, and
research has provided numerous examples of the physio-
logical effects imagery has on the body (Graham, 1995).
Unlike many other treatment options which separate the
mind­body by focusing on either the psychological or the
physiological aspects of IBS, hypnotherapy potentially
addresses both via the brain­gut axis. However, the appli-
cation of `gut-directed' hypnosis has not been compared
with combined gut and mind­body hypnosis: the latter
theoretically might increase the benefit of hypnotherapy
as an intervention because psychological distress is so
prevalent in patients with IBS (Labus et al., 2007; Park
et al., 2008).
We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of hypnosis and
imagery in the treatment of IBS. More specifically, we aimed
to compare the use of standard `gut-related' imagery used in
previous trials which addressed the patients' physiological
problems only (Gonsalkorale et al., 2002; Whorwell, 1987,
2006), with mind­body imagery that reflects the patients'
complete symptom picture (i.e. imagery which addresses
both the psychological and physiological aspects of IBS) in a
randomised controlled trial.
Method
Study participants
A total of 51 symptomatic volunteers with IBS aged
between 17 and 75years were recruited from medical and
naturopathic clinics and were invited to undergo a 1-hour
screening session. They were then randomly assigned to
one of three groups. Concealed allocation was assured by
an assistant placing the names of participants into opaque
envelopes and placing them in a locked filing cabinet. A
fortnight after the screening session, all three groups began
the treatment programme which consisted of five fort-
nightly treatment sessions (half an hour each) over a period
of 9
weeks, with a subsequent follow-up of 2
weeks and
3
months. The flow of patients through the study is sum-
marised in Figure 1.
The Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney
approved the trial, and guidelines on patient consent were met.
Inclusion criteria
The participants were deemed suitable for the study after
having been diagnosed with IBS by a primary care physi-
cian or gastroenterologist. All had to meet the Rome II cri-
teria for IBS (Drossman, 1999; Drossman et al., 2000)
(specifically, pain or abdominal discomfort relieved by def-
ecation, and/or onset associated with a change in stool fre-
quency, and/or onset associated with a change in stool
form), had failed to respond adequately to conventional
medicines, and who had experienced at least 4days with at
least moderate pain over a 2-week period after screening.
Exclusion criteria
Participants who were not free of organic disease (e.g.
those who were diagnosed with coeliac disease, inflamma-
tory bowel disease or diverticulitis as well as IBS) and who
did not fit the inclusion criteria were excluded. Current
medications were not discontinued.
Gastrointestinal screening of study population
During the initial screening session, participants completed
thevalidatedTalleyIrritableBowelSymptomQuestionnaire
(IBSQ) (Talley et al., 1995) to establish diagnosis and
exclude other differential diagnoses. They also completed
the validated Bowel Symptom Severity Scale (BSSS)
(Boyce et al., 2000) to establish the severity of their IBS
symptoms.
Interventions
The participants were randomly allocated to one of three
groups ­ two experimental groups (either `individualised'
or standard `gut-directed' hypnosis) and one control group
(relaxation therapy) ­ by means of random number tables
(Boyer, 1968) and were unaware of which treatment group
they were assigned to and of other participants in the trial.
Also, consultations for other patients were always inter-
spersed between those for any IBS trial participants to min-
imise contact between subjects.

4 Health Psychology Open 
At the end of the trial, participants in the control group
were offered two complementary sessions in hypnosis. The
five treatment sessions were spaced approximately a fortnight
apart over a period of 9weeks. In the first of the five half-hour
sessions, the patient's full history was taken and the function-
ing of the GI tract was explained. The following procedure
was then strictly adhered to for all five sessions of the trial.
`Individualised'hypnosis. Hypnosis was induced using a rapid
eye catalepsy technique (Elman, 1964) after which the ther-
apist read two prepared scripts ­ one containing `gut-
directed' imagery (physiological symptoms of IBS), plus a
further script containing the patient's individual psycho-
logical symptoms as evidenced by the Symptom Checklist
90-R (SCL-90-R) (Derogatis, 1994; Derogatis et al., 1975).
At the end of the second session, a CD of the scripts used in
this session was given to the patient to be taken home and
practised daily.
Standard `gut-directed' hypnosis.
Hypnosis was induced
(using a rapid eye catalepsy technique), after which the
therapist read the same prepared script containing `gut-
directed' imagery (physiological symptoms of IBS) as for
group one. No script containing the patient's psychological
symptoms was read. At the end of the second session, a CD
of the `gut-directed' imagery script was given to the patient
to be taken home and practised daily.
Relaxation therapy.No hypnosis was induced. The therapist
read a prepared script of a progressive relaxation exercise that
contained neither the aforementioned `gut-directed' imagery
nor the patient's individual psychological symptoms. At the
end of the second session, a CD of the relaxation exercise was
given to the patient to be taken home and practised daily.
Compliance for home practice was checked by the ther-
apist at each treatment session and was also evidenced by
the participants' responses to Question 6 of the Bowel
Symptom Scale 3 (BSS3) and Question 7 of the Bowel
Symptom Scale 4 (BSS4).
Follow-up.The Bowel Symptom Severity Scale (BSSS)
(Boyce et al., 2000) and the SF-36 Health Survey (Stewart
et al., 1988) were completed by each participant, at 2weeks
and again at 3months after completion of the 9-week treat-
ment period, to assess whether IBS symptoms had signifi-
cantly changed compared with baseline. No further treatment
was given during the follow-up period, nor were participants
invited to return for further treatment if symptoms returned.
Instruments
Irritable Bowel Symptom Questionnaire (IBSQ)
A modified validated version of the previously validated
Talley BSQ (Talley et al., 1995) was utilised in order to
verify the diagnosis of IBS and to acquire general data on
patients participating in the trial. The BSQ addressed
aspects such as pain/discomfort, bloating, frequency and
type of bowel movement, urgency, and frequency of visits
to a doctor or alternative therapist.
Bowel Symptom Scales (BSS1-5)
The BSS (Boyce et al., 2003) were used to assess change in
IBS symptoms during the course of the five treatment ses-
sions. The first item of all five BSSs consists of five visual
analogue scales which refer to each of the principal symp-
toms of IBS (pain/discomfort, bloating, constipation and
diarrhoea), plus an overall symptom severity rating. All
five of the BSS also assess stool form and the degree to
which IBS symptoms interfered with the patient's life and
activities (see Tables 2a to 2d and Figure 2).
Bowel Symptom Severity Scale (BSSS)
The BSSS (Boyce et al., 2000) consists of eight questions
relating to possible symptoms the patient may have
endured in the 2
weeks between treatment sessions. The
symptoms specific in this questionnaire enquire about
stool formation, abdominal pain, frequency of bowel
motions, bloating, urgency, inability to have a bowel
motion and a general feeling of discomfort in the abdo-
men. Each question also has two sub-questions which
asked how distressed the patient had been during this
period and how much the specific symptoms had inter-
fered with his or her daily life. Each of the symptoms is
given a severity rating between 0 and 4, a higher rating
being indicative of greater severity.
Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R)
The SCL-90-R (Derogatis, 1994; Derogatis et al., 1975) helps
to evaluate a broad range of psychological problems and
symptoms of psychopathology and is also useful in measur-
ing the patients' progress or treatment outcomes. It provides
an overview of the patients'symptoms and their intensity.
The questionnaire consists of 90 items which measure
nine primary symptom dimensions: somatisation, obses-
sive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, depres-
sion, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation
and psychoticism. For the purpose of this trial, four of the
nine primary symptom dimensions (anxiety, depression,
interpersonal sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive disor-
der) which reflected the psychological symptoms of
the majority of the participants were measured a priori.
Those participants in the `individualised' hypnosis group
who scored 10 or higher on any of the four scales were
read specific scripts pertaining to their disorder during the
treatment sessions.
Phillips-Moore et al. 5
Short Form General Health Survey (SF-36)
The SF-36 General Health Survey (McHorney et al., 1994)
has been applied widely to clinical trials and is capable of
discriminating between healthy participants and those with
moderate levels of psychiatric illness (Russo et al., 1998).
The SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire consisting of eight
health concepts or sub-scales broadly related to quality of
life, mental health and social activities.
The sensitivity of the SF-36 to change in health status
of IBS patients was tested by examining changes in SF-36
sub-scale scores throughout the treatment period and as
follow-up 2
weeks and 3
months after the completion of
the trial.
Duke-UNC Functional Social Support
Questionnaire
The eight-item Duke-UNC Questionnaire (Broadhead
et al., 1988) was completed by the participants at the screen-
ing session to assess the amount of support patients had and
to what extent it influenced their health and well-being. The
questionnaire contains questions in two content areas: con-
fident social support, which reflects a confidant relation-
ship where important matters in life such as social contact
and personal/work/financial problems are discussed and
shared; and affective support, which reflects a more emo-
tional form of support and caring.
Survey of Recent Life Experiences (SRLE)
Emotional responses to life stress can influence GI func-
tion via the brain­gut axis and produce symptoms such as
pain and altered bowel function (Lundberg, 2005; Mayer,
2000). The SRLE (Kohn and MacDonald, 1992) which
consists of 51 items covering six concepts (social and
cultural difficulties, work, time pressure, finances, social
acceptability and social victimisation) was completed by
the participants at the screening session to determine
whether these stresses had had an influence on their IBS
symptoms.
Credibility Scale
The Credibility Scale (Borkovec and Nau, 1972) was issued
to participants on two occasions throughout the trial (session
2 and session 4) to assess the credibility of treatment as per-
ceived by the participants and to test the success of blinding.
The four-item assessment contains questions on how
confident the patients are in the treatment they are receiv-
ing, how confident they are in recommending the treat-
ment to a friend suffering a similar complaint, how logical
the treatment seems to them and how successful they think
this form of treatment would be in alleviating other
complaints.
Statistical analysis
For the primary endpoint (BSS), an intention to treat analy-
sis of variance was used to determine the differences among
groups at baseline, end of treatment, and follow-up and
repeated measures for trend over time were also deter-
mined. All p values were two-tailed, unless otherwise indi-
cated, and the alpha level of significance was set at 0.05.
Missing scale and item scores were not replaced. Data for
all other outcome measures (psychological stress (SRLE)),
quality of life (SF-36) and social support (Duke-UNC) are
presented as per protocol analysis.
It was hypothesised a priori that, with respect to the
abdominal pain sub-scale of the SCL-90-R, the control
group would not change on average, the standard therapy
group would improve by one point and the individualised
therapy group by two points. Under these conditions and
with an assumed standard deviation (SD)=2.0, n=25 par-
ticipants per study group would have yielded statistical
power >0.85 at the 0.05 (two-tailed) level of statistical
significance. Due to difficulty with recruitment, n=17
participants were actually recruited per group, and this
yields statistical power of approximately 0.72 under the
same conditions. While this power is less than the desired
0.8, it is unlikely to have materially affected the statistical
analysis.
Results
Baseline characteristics
At baseline, the 51 participants in this study were similar
across treatment areas (Table 1). All participants pre-
sented with psychological problems. Of these, 30 partici-
pants presented with depression, 4 with anxiety, 2 with
obsessive-compulsive disorder and 1 with interpersonal
sensitivity. Of the remainder, 5 had both depression and
anxiety, 5 had depression and obsessive-compulsive dis-
order, and 4 presented with depression and interpersonal
sensitivity.
At the commencement of the trial period, the majority of
participants (81.6%) suffered abdominal pain most of the
time (of these, 59.2% had mild to moderate pain and 40.8%
had severe to very severe pain) with 61.2% of participants
experiencing pain several times a week or daily. In the
3
months prior to treatment, 98.0% of participants experi-
enced bloating and 78.4% of participants had visible
abdominal swelling. Of the 51 participants, 51% were
diarrhoea predominant, 44.9% constipation predominant,
and 4.1% had mixed diarrhoea and constipation. The major-
ity of participants in this study were women (86.3%), and
the majority of sufferers were aged between 20 and 40years
(82.3%).
Three participants withdrew from the trial (one each in
sessions 1, 2 and 4), and six subjects were excluded from
6 Health Psychology Open 
the analysis at the end of the trial due to incomplete or miss-
ing records.
Response to intervention
All participants demonstrated improvement in the overall
severity of their individual symptoms and functioning at
the end of the treatment period (Session 5), with the `indi-
vidualised' group (group one) having a numerically better
outcome than the other two groups (Tables 2a to 2d). The
overall symptom score was not significantly different at
Session 5, and improvement in IBS symptoms (Figure 3)
and general health outcomes (Figure 4) did not continue
during the 3-month follow-up period.

Psychological stress
The bowel symptom severity measures (BSSS) specific to
frequency of bowel motions, distress and interference with
daily life at the end of treatment sessions, and the SCL-
90-R measures, depression, obsessive-compulsive and
interpersonal sensitivity at baseline, were significantly cor-
related (p
<
.01), but anxiety was unrelated. At the end of
treatment sessions, the overall severity of IBS (BSSS) was
significantly correlated (p<.05) with all SCL-90-R scores
except anxiety (Table 3).

Social support
At baseline, the confident social support score (Duke-
UNC) was negatively correlated with bowel symptom
severity scores and with all psychological scores (as per the
SCL-90-R) except depression. The correlation between the
confident support score and depression was significant
(p<.05) (Table 3).
Quality of life
Participants in all three groups demonstrated an improve-
ment in overall severity in their IBS symptoms and a subse-
quent improvement in their quality of life. There was a
highly significant decrease in the level of pain, and also a
highly significant improvement in the patients' vitality,
social functioning and mental health. There was also sig-
nificant improvement in physical functioning, general
health and the extent to which emotional problems inter-
fered with their work or daily activities from baseline
(Figure 4). However, there was no significant treatment
effect (Table 4).
Credibility Scale
The participants in all three groups showed that their expec-
tancy for improvement increased from the commencement
of their treatment to the end of treatment, although the
results did not show statistically significant differences
among the three treatment groups (Figure 5).
Discussion
The study follows on previous research which has shown
`gut-directed'hypnotherapy to be of benefit to patients with
IBS (Gonsalkorale et al., 2002; Whorwell, 1987, 2006).
The study tested both physiological and specific psycho-
logical imagery in the hypnotherapy scripts and compared
this technique to standard `gut-directed' hypnotherapy.
Psychological distress, which can trigger or exacerbate
symptoms (Jarrett et al., 1998; Koloski et al., 2003), has
been shown to be an important component of IBS symp-
toms and probably should be considered when treatment
strategies are designed. To our knowledge, studies on hyp-
notherapy as a treatment for IBS have not taken this into
account (Anbar, 2001; Forbes et al., 2000; Gonsalkorale
et al., 2002; Harvey et al., 1989; Palsson, 1998; Whorwell,
1987). By using scripts that specifically target each indi-
vidual patient's emotional/psychological symptoms (in
conjunction with scripts for the physiological aspects of the
disease), the therapist in this trial attempted to address the
whole patient profile.
Based on previous research and consistent with the aims
of this study, the present research sought to empirically
investigate three main hypotheses.
The first hypothesis was that participants who had been
diagnosed with IBS would present with not only physiolog-
ical symptoms but psychological ones as well and, that at
the end of the study, participants who underwent `individu-
alised' hypnotherapy (using imagery which addressed both
the psychological/emotional aspects and the physiological
symptoms of the syndrome) would have a better outcome
in the improvement in their IBS symptoms than partici-
pants who underwent standard `gut-directed' hypnotherapy
in which physiological symptoms alone were treated. In
this study, participants presented with high baseline scores
on psychological ratings. However, while all groups
improved from baseline on multiple measures, there was no
overall benefit detected for hypnotherapy over relaxation
therapy.
The second hypothesis we tested was that participants'
IBS symptoms would improve during the trial period, and,
as a result, their quality of life would subsequently improve.
Quality of life did improve in all treatment arms but, again,
we detected no differential effect of hypnotherapy.
The third hypothesis was that participants who had a
support system in place would improve more quickly than
those who had not. We found that there was no significant
correlation between support and improvement in the over-
all severity of IBS symptoms. The only significant correla-
tion found was between the confident support score and the
depression score.
This study had several strengths. The study was ran-
domised and concealed allocation was assured by an assis-
tant placing the names of participants into opaque envelopes
and placing them in a locked filing cabinet. IBS and the
functioning of the GI tract were explained. Careful atten-
tion was given to blinding throughout the trial, and the
therapist (the principle author) who administered the ther-
apy was an experienced and qualified hypnotherapist.
Other strengths of this study lie in the fact that participants
were recruited prospectively; participants with other pre-
existing functional GI diseases were carefully excluded;
and both validated, standardised questionnaires to define
the outcome measure of IBS and strict criteria for diagnos-
ing IBS were utilised. Also, the drop-out rate during the
trial was small.
There were also limitations in this study. It may not have
been sufficiently powered. Due to time limits and the fact
that the therapist was the only person recruiting, the sample
size was modest. A much larger sample size would have
been required to detect such a small effect size difference
among the groups, but such a difference would possibly
still not have been clinically significant.
Another potential limitation was an absence of contact
with participants by the therapist during the follow-up
period. In previous trials in hypnotherapy (Gonsalkorale
et al., 2002; Whorwell, 1987, 2006), participants continued
to receive hypnotherapy sessions on a monthly basis during
the follow-up period and were asked to telephone if they
Phillips-Moore et al. 11
experienced a relapse so that a further session of hypno-
therapy could be arranged. In this study, there was no fur-
ther contact with the therapist by the participants, adherence
to protocols during the follow-up period was not checked
and participants were not given further hypnotherapy ses-
sions (either on a regular basis or in case of relapse) to
maintain remission. This could be a possible explanation
for the lack of improvement in IBS symptoms during the
follow-up period. With continued checking of adherence to
autohypnosis practice and ongoing hypnotherapy sessions
with the therapist, improvement in scores may have
increased but, in the authors' view, to do so would not have
addressed if any benefit persisted.
Research has indicated that EEG wave changes associ-
ated with hypnosis can also be triggered by other methods
of deep concentration, such as the relaxation response
(Jacobs and Friedman, 2004; Williams and Gruzelier,
2001). Previous trials on relaxation training as a treatment
for IBS, however, have shown mixed results (Blanchard
et al., 1993; Boyce et al., 2003; Spiller, 2005; Van der Veek
et al., 2007).
Nevertheless, the control group in the trial underwent
sessions in relaxation as a treatment for their IBS symp-
toms, whereas treatment for the other two experimental
groups involved sessions in hypnotherapy. Considering that
the relaxation response can trigger brain wave changes
associated with hypnosis and that hypnotherapy sessions,
themselves, involve deep relaxation, participants in the
control group could have easily lapsed into hypnosis. This
could account for the similarities in treatment outcome and
the small effect difference between the groups.
Notwithstanding the limitations of this clinical trial and
that the findings need further confirmation, this study
appears to support a psycho-physiological hypothesis that

successful treatment of the psychological aspect is accom-
panied by improvement in IBS symptoms. Future research
needs to continue the investigation of the brain­gut axis in
IBS and the role of hypnotherapy which addresses both the
psychological and physiological aspects of this disorder, as
an effective and viable treatment option.
In conclusion, in a randomised, controlled trial of hyp-
notherapy in IBS, symptoms (pain, bloating, constipation
and diarrhoea) and physical functions improved from base-
line in each arm. Hypnotherapy, however, was not shown to
be superior to relaxation therapy for symptom reduction in
this disorder. A possible explanation for this could be that
the relaxation response is also associated with hypnosis and
participants in the control group could have lapsed into a
trance state. This also suggests that reducing anxiety
through relaxation may be the key to reducing IBS symp-
toms in patients, whatever the mechanism may be.
