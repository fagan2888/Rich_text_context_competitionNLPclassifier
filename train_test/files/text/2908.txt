Abstract
This paper investigates how multinational firms choose the capital structure of their
foreign affiliates in response to political risk. We focus on two choice variables, the
leverage and the ownership structure of the foreign affiliate, and we distinguish dif-
ferent types of political risk, such as expropriation, unreliable intellectual property
rights and confiscatory taxation. In our theoretical analysis we find that, as political
risk increases, the ownership share tends to decrease, whereas leverage can both in-
crease or decrease, depending on the type of political risk. Using the Microdatabase
Direct Investment of the Deutsche Bundesbank, we find supportive evidence for these
different effects.

Multinational enterprises (MNE) have to adapt their optimal investment strategy to local
conditions worldwide. Most notably, they have to respond to different political environ-
ments that in different locations may give rise to varying political risks. In this paper we
investigate, both theoretically and empirically, the way MNE choose their capital structure
in response to political risk. For this purpose, we distinguish different types of political
risk. We find that it is important to identify the type that prevails in a particular country,
because different types of risk affect the optimal financing decision in different ways.
We focus on two choice variables that determine the capital structure - the level of lever-
age and the ownership structure of the foreign affiliate. Choosing higher leverage reduces
tax payments but increases the risk of bankruptcy, involving some bankruptcy cost. The
investor balances optimally these costs and benefits of debt financing. Furthermore, he
chooses how much of the affiliate to sell to outside investors, taking into account how the
ownership structure affects the agency costs and the value of the affiliate.
We distinguish three prototypes of political risk throughout the paper, ranging from out-
right expropriation to creeping expropriation like unreliable intellectual property rights and
confiscatory taxation.
Our analysis shows that these different forms of political risk affect equity holders and
debt holders in different ways and can therefore result in the multinational choosing differ-
ent capital structures. In our theoretical analysis we find that, as political risk increases,
the ownership share tends to decrease. In contrast, leverage can both increase or decrease,
depending on the type of political risk, with the negative sign more likely to be prevailing
the more severe the type of political risk.
In our empirical analysis, we use the Microdatabase Direct Investment (MiDi) of the
Deutsche Bundesbank to investigate the impact of political risk on both the choice of
ownership shares and the choice of leverage of foreign affiliates of German multinationals.
We estimate the impact of political risk on our two choice variables, ownership share and
leverage. Using the risk measure of the International Country Risk Guide and allowing the
marginal effect of political risk to vary with the severity of political risk, we find that indeed
leverage first increases and then decreases in political risk. For ownership, it is compara-
tively more likely that the ownership share decreases with political risk.
We then employ various empirical measures, reflecting different types of political risk, and
identify them with different scenarios. Following this strategy we can confirm that the
ownership share decreases in political risk no matter what type of measure we introduce,
while leverage can either increase or decrease in response to different types of risk.

Multinational Firms and their Choice of Capital Structure1
1 Introduction
Multinational enterprises (MNE) have to adapt their optimal investment strategy to local
conditions worldwide. Most notably, they have to respond to different political environ-
ments that in different locations may give rise to varying political risks. Political risk
encompasses not only `sovereign risk', the risk that the sovereign will interfere with a firm's
ability to pay its investors as promised, but also other forms of political, economic and
country-specific risks that affect the profitability of an investment in a foreign country and
that would not be present if the country had more stable and developed business environ-
ment and legal institutions (Hill (1998) and Buckley (1992)). This risk ranges from outright
expropriation to more subtle forms like confiscatory taxation, corruption, or economic con-
straints such as exchange rate controls. MNE can try to insure against political risk, but
they can never do so fully.2
In this paper we investigate, both theoretically and empirically, the way MNE choose
their capital structure in response to political risk. For this purpose, we distinguish different
types of political risk. We find that it is important to identify the type that prevails in a
particular country, because different types of risk affect the optimal financing decision in
different ways.
We focus on two choice variables that determine the capital structure - the level of

2First, the insurance market for political risk is incomplete because most types of political risk
are not contractible and because the market suffers from severe asymmetric information (see for
example Desai, Foley, and Hines Jr. (2006)). Second, many investors are unaware of the existence
of political risk insurance and even those who are aware of its existence often do not have such
insurance (www.political-risk.net).

leverage and the ownership structure of the foreign affiliate. Choosing higher leverage
reduces tax payments but increases the risk of bankruptcy, involving some bankruptcy cost.
The investor balances optimally these costs and benefits of debt financing. Furthermore,
he chooses how much of the affiliate to sell to outside investors, taking into account how
the ownership structure affects the agency costs and the value of the affiliate.
We distinguish three prototypes of political risk throughout the paper.3 In Scenario I,
political risk takes the form of outright expropriation or nationalization, where the investor
loses all assets and can no longer service his credits. In the past, this type of political
risk used to be very important (Kobrin (1980), Andersson (1991)). Though in general it
seems to be less prevalent nowadays there are very recent examples indicating its latent
relevance.4
Scenario II captures political risk as a form of creeping expropriation that lowers the
expected returns of the project. Examples could be lack of protection for intellectual
property rights or unreliable contract enforcement, but could also be economic constraints
like currency or exchange rate controls, or particular regulatory requirements directed at
foreign multinationals. Political violence that negatively affects market conditions and
hence expected revenues would be another example.
In Scenario III, we capture political risk that directly affects the profits of the invest-
ment, i.e., after servicing potential debt payments. This type of political risk arises if the
host country imposes discriminatory and confiscatory taxation, asks for bribes or blocks
the repatriation of funds from the host country to the home country.
Our analysis shows that these different forms of political risk affect equity holders and
debt holders in different ways and can therefore result in the multinational choosing dif-
ferent capital structures. We find that the optimal debt level decreases with increasing
political risk in both Scenarios I and II because (creeping) expropriation increases the risk
of bankruptcy, which calls for smaller leverage. But the optimal debt level increases with
political risk in Scenario III because the negative effects of discriminatory or confiscatory
3For a description of various forms of political risks see Buckley (1992), Hill (1998).
4Recent examples where expropriations have taken place are Zimbabwe and Venezuela. In
2007, a law was adopted in Zimbabwe that forces foreign investors to find a majority Zimbabwean
shareholder within five to ten years (compare for example dpa and netzeitung.de (27/09/2007)
or VOANews, AFP, and Reuters (11/03/2008)). In 2008, both Cemex, a Mexican cement com-
pany, and Sidor, Venezuela's biggest producer of steel, were expropriated by the Venezuelan govern-
ment without paying appropriate compensation (compare for example AP (01/05/2008), Romero
(18/05/2008), or Ackerman (19/09/2008)).

taxation can be contained with higher leverage. Furthermore, we find that, in all three sce-
narios, the optimal ownership share tends to decrease as the level of political risk increases
because political risk reduces the investor's expected returns from the foreign affiliate, but
does not reduce the managerial cost of running the firm. Interestingly, though, due to the
interaction with the optimal debt choice, the ownership share reduction is less pronounced
in case of confiscatory taxation, where the debt level increases, as compared to the case of
(creeping) expropriation, where the debt level is reduced as a response to political risk.
In our empirical analysis, we use the Microdatabase Direct Investment (MiDi) of the
Deutsche Bundesbank to investigate the impact of political risk on both the choice of own-
ership shares and the leverage of foreign affiliates of German multinationals. The dataset
contains balance sheet information on the foreign affiliates. German parent companies are
required by law to report this information when the balance sheet total of the affiliate and
the ownership share are larger than a certain threshold. As a measure for political risk, we
use the time-varying, country-specific index that is provided by the International Country
Risk Guide (ICRG) and that is composed of 12 weighted variables covering both political
and social attributes.
We estimate the impact of political risk on our two choice variables, ownership share
and leverage. We start by looking at the linear effects of political risk. Our ownership
regression indicates that MNEs hold a smaller share of the equity of the foreign affiliate
when political risk is high, confirming our theoretical predictions. Regarding the leverage
choice, we find that affiliates of MNE use a higher level of debt in countries with a higher
level of political risk. This would suggest the prevalence of the less invasive Scenario III
type of political risk.
We then attempt to capture the theoretical insight that the effects of political risk
may differ for different scenarios of political risk. For this purpose we follow two different
strategies. One strategy is to employ various empirical measures, reflecting different types
of political risk, and to identify them with different scenarios. Following this strategy of
using different measures we can confirm that the ownership share decreases in political risk
no matter what type of measure we introduce, while leverage can either increase or decrease
in response to different types of risk. The second strategy is to rank the scenarios according
to their severity and to introduce a quadratic function of political risk which allows the
marginal effects of political risk to vary with the severity of political risk. Following this
3
3
approach, we find that indeed leverage first increases and then decreases in political risk.
For ownership, it is comparatively more likely that the ownership share decreases with
political risk.
Our paper is related to two strands of literature, the literature on political risk and the
literature on the capital structure choice.
The first strand studies the effects of political risk on foreign direct investment. The
early theoretical papers were primarily concerned with the question of how foreign direct
investment can be sustained if there is a risk of nationalization. The seminal paper in this
literature is Eaton and Gersovitz (1983), which shows under what circumstances reputation
can sustain foreign direct investment. Other papers study how political risk affects the
multinational's investment strategy. This may induce the investor to choose an inefficient
technology (Eaton (1995)), inefficient investment paths (Thomas and Worrall (1994), and
Schnitzer (1999)) or excess capacity (Janeba (2000)). More recent papers have investigated
the sale of shares to locals as a possible way of mitigating the risk of confiscatory taxation
or creeping expropriation (Konrad and Lommerud (2001), Mueller and Schnitzer (2006)).
However, none of these authors have allowed for different forms of political risk that impact
on the investor's decisions in different ways. Empirical studies have focussed on the question
of how country characteristics affect the ownership structure in foreign direct investment
projects (Asiedu and Esfahani (2001)).
The second strand of literature has so far mainly focused on taxes as the driving force
behind the capital structure choice. It has been shown both empirically and theoretically
that tax incentives lead to national differences in the level of leverage of affiliates of MNE
(see for example Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004), Huizinga, Laeven, and Nicodeme (2006),
Buettner, Overesch, Schreiber, and Wamser (2006) and Mintz and Weichenrieder (2005)).
However, there is much less evidence on how differing levels of political risk may affect the
capital structure of affiliates that are located in different countries. For US-data, Desai,
Foley and Hines (2004) find that political risk increases affiliate leverage. Aggarwal and
Kyaw (2004) also use US data, but on a more aggregated level. In contrast to Desai, Foley
and Hines, they find that political risk reduces affiliate leverage. Novaes and Werlang (2005)
study foreign affiliates in Brazil and find that they are more highly leveraged than their
Brazilian counterparts and that the difference increases with Brazil's political risk. This
conflicting evidence suggests that the relationship between political risk and leverage is not
4

straightforward and hence needs more examination.
The contribution of our paper is twofold. Firstly, it provides a theoretical framework
that explicitly models the choice of the capital structure in response to political risk. It is
also the first paper to distinguish in a theoretical framework different kinds of political risk.
Secondly, our paper contributes to the empirical literature on political risk by investigating
the impact of political risk on both leverage and ownership choices, and by distinguishing
the impact of different types and magnitudes of political risk. As our theoretical analysis
suggests, the coefficient measuring the impact of political risk on leverage may indeed
change signs, depending on the type of political risk. We find this possibility of different
coefficients confirmed in our empirical analysis.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our theoretical
model and analyzes the optimal financial structure in the baseline model. Section 3 intro-
duces different types of political risk and investigates the optimal financial structure in the
presence of political risk. In section 4, we derive empirical predictions. Section 5 introduces
the data set. In Section 6 we present our empirical results. Section 7 concludes.
2 The base line model
Consider a multinational investor who intends to invest a fixed amount I in a foreign
location. The project generates a stochastic return R, with R being uniformly distributed
on the interval [0, ¯
R]. The investment can be financed with either debt, D, or equity, E, or
a combination of the two, such that E + D = I.
The investor has to take two decisions, he has to choose (i) how much debt finance D
to use as opposed to equity finance and (ii) what share  of the affiliate to keep for himself,
i.e., what share (1 - ) of the affiliate to sell to outside investors. In the corporate finance
literature, these decisions have always been studied separately. Thus, to jointly investigate
both decisions, we set up a model that draws on both strands of the corporate finance
literature, the one on the debt versus equity decision and the one on the optimal ownership
share.
Leverage choice
To model the debt versus equity choice, we consider the well established tradeoff that debt
5
5
financing allows to save on tax payments but increases the probability of bankruptcy, giving
rise to potential dead weight losses.5 To capture this tradeoff, we assume that in case of debt
financing D the investor's liability is restricted to the investment project. So if the investor
takes up debt D, he has to repay (1 + r)D, where r denotes the interest rate. He can do so
only when the project is sufficiently successful, i.e., generates returns R  (1 + r)D. The
remaining profits, after interest payments have been deducted, are subject to local taxation,
at interest rate t. If the returns are not sufficient to cover the repayment, the project is
liquidated and the investor has to give up all the returns to the bank. The affiliate's value
V for a given level of D is thus
V =
¯
R
(1+r)D
(1 - t)[R - (1 + r)D]

¯
R
dR + D - I (1)
Banks are assumed to operate in a competitive market and to be risk neutral. This
means that, for any level of debt that the investor wants the bank to finance, the interest
rate r is chosen such that the bank can expect to break even. We assume that in case
of bankruptcy transaction costs are incurred during the bankruptcy procedure such that
the bank is able to seize only some share s of the returns that are generated, with s < 1.
This assumption is supposed to capture the dead weight loss that is associated with debt
financing due to the risk of bankruptcy. The interest rate is implicitly defined by the bank's
break even condition

where the first integral represents the expected interest payments and the second integral
represents the expected payoff the bank realizes in case of bankruptcy.
Ownership choice
Consider now the ownership choice of the investor, i.e. what share (1 - ) of the foreign
affiliate to sell to outside investors. If financial markets are competitive and perfect, i.e.
with no transaction costs and risk neutrality, then the assets will be valued by outside
investors at their expected value. So the price the investor realizes for selling a share of
5In the corporate finance literature, this tradeoff is often called the tradeoff between interest tax
shields and the costs of financial distress. See, e.g., Brealey and Myers (1996), pp. 496ff. Seminal
papers on this issue are Kraus and Litzenberger (1973), and Scott (1976).

(1 - ) of the affiliate, P((1 - )V ), is equal to (1 - )V .6 We will discuss below how
things change if markets are not perfect, in particular if the exposure of outside investors
to political risk differs from that of insiders.
To model the ownership decision, we draw again on the corporate finance literature.
In this literature, two potential effects are discussed why (and how) the ownership choice
may affect the firm's value. The convergence-of-interest hypothesis predicts that larger
ownership stakes are associated with higher firm values, because they allow for a better
alignment of the incentives of owner and manager or inside and outside investors.7 The
entrenchment hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that insiders who control a substantial
part of the shares may indulge in non-value maximizing behavior at the cost of outside
investors.8 Empirical studies on this issue suggest that the firm value as a function of
the insider's ownership share  follows an inverted u-shaped pattern. This evidence has
been interpreted such that the convergence-of-interest effect dominates for low and the
entrenchment effect for large values of .9
Following the convergence-of-interest hypothesis we assume that the investor increases
his effort as  increases, at cost K(), with K () > 0 and K () > 0, as larger ownership
stakes imply more effort to be spent on the firm. Following the entrenchment hypothesis,
we assume that the investor enjoys private benefits B() that increase in , i.e. B () > 0,
but at a decreasing rate, i.e. B () < 0. The combination of effort and entrenchment
effects are reflected in the revenues of the affiliate that can be appropriated by the investors
in the following way: ¯
R is an inverted u-shaped function of , with ¯
R () > 0 for  = 0,
¯
R () < 0 and ¯
R (^
) = 0 for 0 < ^
 < 1.
The investor's payoff function from holding equity share , selling equity share (1 - )
and experiencing private benefits and costs can thus be summarized as follows:
U(D, ) = V (D, ) + P[(1 - )V (D, )] + B() - K() = V (D, ) + B() - K() (3)
The investor chooses both the optimal debt level D and the optimal ownership share  in
order to maximize his payoff function.

The optimal financial structure
We now turn to solving the base line model without political risk. For this, consider again
the investor's payoff function, which, using the specification of the firm value in equation
(1), is

Result 2 shows the expected pattern for the optimal debt level: as the tax rate increases,
the debt level increases. It is also straightforward to show that dD
ds
> 0, i.e. as the
inefficiency of bankruptcy decreases, the optimal debt level increases. This captures the
well established tradeoff of debt versus equity financing. For the ownership share, we find
that  decreases if ¯
R > 0 in the relevant parameter range, which, as equation 10 shows, is
the case if B < K , i.e. unless the entrenchment benefits are particularly large.
3 Political risk and the optimal financial structure
Consider now that the investment project is subject to political risk in the foreign location.
To study how this affects the firm's financial structure, we distinguish different forms of
political risk.
(1) Expropriation
The first type of political risk we consider is expropriation or nationalization. This is the
classic form of political risk where a sovereign simply takes property without compensation
(Buckley (1992), Hill (1998)). We capture this form of political risk by assuming that the
investment is expropriated with some probability 1, i.e. the investors lose control and cash
flow rights from the investment. This leads to the following modified firm value function.
V1 = (1 - 1)
¯
R
(1+r)D
(1 - t)[R - (1 + r)D]

Credits are serviced only if the investment is not expropriated. So the zero profit
condition for banks needs to be modified. This is captured by the following condition.

Of course, if the investment is expropriated, the investor also loses his benefits from
potential entrenchment, B(). His managerial effort cost of running the firm are incurred
before the potential expropriation takes place and hence are not affected. Thus, the in-
vestor's payoff function is now

This payoff function implicitly assumes that outside investors, no matter where they
are located, are affected by the danger of expropriation in exactly the same way as the
multinational investor. Of course, there may be circumstances where they are better pro-
tected against expropriation, e.g. because they are local investors and the government
compensates them for their losses. In this case their perceived value of the affiliate is not as
negatively affected as the multinational investor's perceived value. We will discuss below
how this affects our results.
(2) Creeping Expropriation
Another form of political risk we consider is creeping expropriation or political violence that
negatively affects the expected returns of the investment project. Other examples would be
currency or exchange rate restrictions, or a failure to enforce or respect the agreed property
and contract rights (Buckley (1992), Hill (1998)). We capture this by assuming that the
investor can capture only a share (1 - 2) of the returns R. This leads to the following
modified firm value function.
V2 =

Proof: See Appendix
Interestingly, we find that both types of political risk, expropriation and creeping ex-
propriation, affect the financial structure and the investor's payoff in the same way. For
a given debt level, the risk of expropriation makes it less likely that interest payments are
made. This has to be compensated by a higher interest rate, which in turn increases the
risk of bankruptcy. As a consequence, the investor chooses a smaller debt level. In case of
creeping expropriation, overall revenues are smaller, increasing the likelihood of bankruptcy
for any given level of debt. This leads to the same reduction of the optimal debt level.
With the same debt level, the overall payoff of the investor is the same, for any given
ownership share. (Creeping) expropriation reduces the monetary and non-monetary payoff
from the investment but does not change the managerial effort cost of running the firm.
Thus, the investor optimally lowers his ownership share. This effect would be even larger
if outside investors were less exposed to political risk and hence would value the foreign
affiliate more highly.10
Desai, Foley, and Hines Jr. (2006), who find empirically that debt is higher in high
political risk countries, have argued that credits taken by local creditors may not react
as much to political risk because local creditors may be more restricted in their choice of
investment opportunities. The empirical evidence does, however, suggest that local interest
rates react positively to political risk (Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004), Aggarwal and Kyaw
(2004)).
(3) (Confiscatory taxation)
Our third scenario captures the type of political risk that directly affects the multinational's
profits. Examples would be the blocking of the repatriation of funds from the host country
to the home country, or corruption and discriminatory and confiscatory taxation that treats
foreign firms differently from domestic firms (Buckley (1992)). We model this as a form
of profit tax, i.e., interest payments can be deducted and are not subject to taxation or
bribes. This scenario is particularly relevant if credits are obtained locally and hence the
local government has no interest in jeopardizing the repayment of local credits.
10This effect will also be larger if the allocation of ownership rights can be used as a means of
influencing the likelihood of nationalization. As Konrad and Lommerud (2001) and Schnitzer (2002)
have shown, it could be in the interest of the investor to share ownership with host country firms,
even without compensation, if this makes the host country less prone to engage in expropriation or
confiscatory taxation.

V3 =

This type of political risk has no impact on the zero profit condition for banks, provided
that the government indeed exempts the interest payments from discriminatory taxation.

As this type of political risk applies to profits rather then revenues, the private benefits of

In contrast to the case of (creeping) expropriation, confiscatory taxation does not in-
crease the likelihood of bankruptcy, but instead induces the investor to choose a higher
debt level to avoid this drain on profits. As pointed out above, this strategy is particularly
worthwhile if debt holders are not negatively affected and hence do not have to increase
interest rates. The optimal ownership share is likely to decrease as confiscatory taxation
increases, provided ¯
R > 0, which, according to the first order condition that implicitly
defines 
3
, is the case if B (
3
) < K (

).
We can summarize the findings from our theoretical analysis as follows:
For the optimal debt level, we find that the effects depend on the type of political
risk. In scenario (1) and (2) the effects were negative. Only in scenario (3) did we find
a positive effect of political risk on the optimal debt level. The effect of political risk on
ownership share tends to be negative in all three scenarios. Only in scenario (3) could it be
positive, and only if the benefits from the entrenchment effect are particularly large. The
following result states furthermore that the optimal ownership share reacts more negatively
to (creeping) expropriation than to confiscatory taxation.

Proof: See Appendix
This is due to the interaction with the optimal debt choice. The ownership share
reduction is smaller in case of confiscatory taxation, where the debt level increases, than in
case of (creeping) expropriation, where the debt level is reduced as a response to political
risk.

4 Empirical predictions
We now turn to the predictions that can be derived from our theoretical analysis. The
following predictions capture the results 4 and 6.
Hypothesis 1 The effect of political risk on the affiliate's debt level is negative in case of
(creeping) expropriation and positive in case of confiscatory taxation.
Hypothesis 2 The effect of political risk on the ownership share is negative in case of
(creeping) expropriation and tends to be negative in case of confiscatory taxation.
The problem of directly testing these hypotheses is that it may be difficult to identify
empirically which type of political risk is present. An alternative approach would be to
rank the different political risk scenarios according to their severity. It seems natural to
argue that the first two scenarios of (creeping) expropriation capture a more severe type
of political risk because they describe situations where political risk increases the risk of
bankruptcy, whereas the third scenario describes a situation where political risk is less
severe, because it affects the profitability of the investment only, without jeopardizing the
survival of the affiliate and hence without imposing additional dead weight losses. Following
this approach, we can state the following hypothesis.
Hypothesis 3 The more severe the political risk, the more likely the debt level will be
negatively affected.
Similarly, we can formulate our hypothesis about the ownership share.
Hypothesis 4 The more severe the political risk, the more likely the ownership share will
be negatively affected.
Result 6 also allows us to compare the relative reactions of leverage and ownership share
to political risk. Whereas the reaction of debt is always positive in case of confiscatory
taxation, this is possible for the ownership share but not necessary. From this, we derive
the following prediction.
Hypothesis 5 The ownership share is more likely to react negatively to political risk than
the debt level.
15
15
Finally, we include one prediction about the impact of taxation on the level of debt and
the ownership share, based on Result 2.
Hypothesis 6 The effect of taxation is positive on the optimal debt level and it tends to
be negative on the ownership share.
5 Data
The empirical analysis presented in section 6 is based on the Microdatabase Direct Invest-
ment (MiDi) of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The database contains a panel dataset of yearly
firm-level information on German parent companies and their foreign affiliates for the pe-
riod 1996-2006. The parents are required by law to report information on their investments
abroad and on the financial characteristics of their foreign affiliates if the balance sheet
total of the affiliate and the ownership share are larger than a certain threshold that varies
over time (Lipponer (2006)).
The MiDi contains 469,332 observations with yearly observations over 11 years. As we
are interested in outward FDI, we exclude all observations on inward FDI. This leaves
303,870 observations that represent affiliate-year cells. Dropping all affiliates that are
present more than once in one year leaves 292,494 observations and deleting all indirect
FDI leaves 208,441 observations. Deleting all firms that report negative equity removes
another 21,489 observations from our dataset. Thus, the final dataset comprises 186,952
observations.
In each year, our sample consists of about 5,000 to 8,000 German parents and of about
15,000 to 24,500 foreign affiliates (compare Table 1). The affiliates are located in more than
140 countries.
We augment the MiDi dataset by country-level information. As a measure of political
risk, we use the time-varying International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) index provided by
the Political Risk Services (PRS) Group. The index is composed of 12 weighted variables
covering both political and social attributes.11 We recode the index in such a way that an
increasing value represents higher political risk.
11Government stability, socioeconomic conditions, investment profile, internal conflict, external
conflict, corruption, military in politics, religion in politics, law and order, ethnic tensions, demo-
cratic accountability and bureaucracy quality.
16
16
There are numerous indices that try to capture the variation of political risk across
countries. A good overview is provided in Howell (2008). For our analysis, the ICRG
index is the best choice for three reasons: First, it takes into account diverse dimensions
of political risk like corruption, bureaucratic quality, but also ethnic and religious tensions
and socioeconomic conditions. Second, while many indices provide only information on a
selective sample of countries, the ICRG index covers more than 140 countries. Third, the
ICRG index varies according to time and provides information for all years that are covered
in the MiDi dataset.
Information on GDP, GDP per capita and the rate of inflation is taken from the World
Economic Outlook Database of the IMF (www.imf.org). The Private Credit variable is
based on Beck, Demirg¨
uc-Kunt, and Levine (1999). It measures the ratio of private credit
lent by deposit money banks to GDP. Statutory tax rates are taken from the Institute for
Fiscal Studies (www.ifs.org.uk), as well as from various issues of the Corporate Tax Guides
of Ernst&Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Table 2 provides descriptive statistics of the variables used in our analysis. The defi-
nitions of the variables are standard, and they are also presented in Table 2. Comparing
the descriptive statistics to those of American MNE in Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004), we
find that regarding most variables used in our analysis, on average American and German
MNEs tend to be quite similar. Both are active in about all countries worldwide. Conse-
quently, the means of our country variables differ only insofar as the time period considered
by Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) is 1982 to 1994, while we analyze the year 1996-2006.
In the period we analyze, both average inflation and political risk are lower. Affiliate-level
variables are also quite similar for German and US-American affiliates, the sole exception
being profits over total assets: while Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) report a share of profit
to assets of about 15 percent, this ratio is at only 4 percent for the German affiliates.
6 Econometric Analysis
The aim of our analysis is to investigate how the capital structure choice of multinational
enterprises reacts to political risk. The two choice variables we consider are the ownership
share and the level of leverage. We define the level of leverage as debt over total assets
and the ownership share as the share of equity of the foreign affiliate held by the German
17
17
parent.
Leverage has a mean of 0.61 and a standard deviation of 0.31 at the firm-level. The
standard deviation of average leverage per country is 0.12. The mean of the ownership
share is 0.87, while its standard deviation is 0.24, and the average ownership share per
country has a standard deviation of 0.14. The political risk indicator has an average value
of 0.19 and a standard deviation of 0.08.
Examples of countries with extremely high political risk in our sample (an average
political risk score above 0.45) are Algeria (with a political risk of 0.50), Colombia (with
an average political risk of 0.47), Nigeria (with an average political risk of 0.54), Pakistan
(political risk at 0.49), Yugoslavia (with an average political risk of 0.47) and Zimbabwe
with a political risk of 0.51. The country with the lowest average political risk in our sample
period is Luxembourg with an average political risk score of 0.07.
Figure 1 presents how the mean of the ownership share by country varies with political
risk. The graph suggests a negative relationship between the ownership share and political
risk even if we do not control for any other country or affiliate specific factors. When
plotting leverage aggregated by country versus political risk (Figure 2), we cannot deduct
any clear relationship between the two variables from the graph. In a regression analysis
at the firm-level we are going to analyze the relationship more thoroughly.
All regressions presented in this paper are estimated by OLS and include parent-fixed-
effects in order to control for parent-specific individual heterogeneity, and we include year
and affiliate industry dummies. Thus, we aim to make use of the observed variation between
affiliates of the same parent which are located in different countries as well as of the variation
over time. In all regressions, we use heteroscedasticity robust standard errors, and we
control for clustering of the standard errors by parent company.
In Table 3, we present the effect of political risk on both our independent variables as
a first test of our hypotheses. We report each regression with and without including our
statutory tax variable, because we lose many observations when including it. The choice
of independent variables is similar to Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) where the authors
investigate the capital structure choice of US-American MNEs. The signs of the coefficients
in our leverage regressions are equal to those presented in Desai, Foley and Hines with some
minor changes.12
12The coefficient of the private credit lent by deposit money banks to GDP is negative and
18
18
On average, an increase in political risk leads to an increase in affiliate leverage and
to a decrease in the ownership share the parent holds in the foreign affiliate. This seems
to be consistent with our hypothesis 5 that leverage is more likely to react positively, if at
all, to political risk, than to the ownership share. In the leverage regression, the coefficient
of political risk of 0.1491 can be interpreted as follows: when political risk increases by
one standard deviation of 0.0797, leverage increases by 0.0119 (=0.1491*0.0797), which
represents 2.3 percent of its mean value. This effect is quite close to the 2.9 percent
estimated by Desai, Foley, Hines (2004) for affiliates of US-American MNEs. The estimated
effect of statutory taxes on the leverage share is 0.0146 (=0.2074*0.0705) which represents
2.8 percent of its mean value. Thus, the relative impact of a change of one standard
deviation in political risk on leverage versus a one standard deviation change in statutory
taxes is about 81 percent. The estimated effect of political risk on the ownership share is
smaller. A one standard deviation increase of political risk decreases the ownership share
by 1.1 percent of its mean value.
The fact that a firm's ownership and leverage choices might be related to each other can
be captured by a correlation of the error terms of the two regressions. The two equations
therefore form a system of seemingly unrelated regressions (Zellner (1962)). In general, it
is more efficient to estimate this system of equations using feasible GLS and to allow for
correlation of the error terms in the asymptotic variance matrix than to use OLS. In our
case, however, there is no efficiency gain from estimating the equations jointly, because the
same regressors are included in both regressions (Cameron and Trivedi (2005)). We test
for correlation of the estimated residuals and we find a positive and significant correlation
in the residuals of the two regressions. This implies that a positive shock on one of the two
variables is also associated with an increase in the other variable.
Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) and Desai, Foley, and Hines Jr. (2006) assume a linear
effect of political risk on the capital structure choice. By contrast, according to our model
the influence of political risk differs by type or strength of political risk, as noted in our
hypotheses 1 to 4. To study this effect in more detail, we follow two empirical strategies.
We first continue to work with the aggregated ICRG index for political risk, but include
significant at the 5 percent level in our leverage regression, while it is not significant even at the 10
percent level in their regression. The logarithm of the affiliates sales shows a significant and positive
effect in our regression, while it is not significant at the 10 percent level in the leverage regression
reported by Desai, Foley and Hines.
19
19
political risk squared, to allow for the the marginal effect of political risk to change with its
level. This corresponds to our interpretation above, that the different scenarios or political
risk can be ranked with respect to their severity, with scenario III being the less severe
and scenarios I/II the more severe. Our second strategy is to use alternative disaggregated
measures for political risk, with the idea to capture more specifically one particular scenario.
Table 4 presents our results for the ICRG political risk index, including political risk
squared. In both regressions, the estimated marginal effect of political risk on the variable
in question is positive for low levels of political risk and negative for high levels of political
risk. Both results are consistent with the predictions of hypotheses 3 and 4. The big
difference between leverage and the ownership share is in the level of political risk where
the marginal effect changes from positive to negative: for leverage, a maximum is reached
at a level of political risk of about 0.3. The vast majority (about 91 percent) of affiliates of
German MNE operate in countries where the political risk is weaker than this - thus, for
them, the predicted effect is positive. Only for about 9 percent of all affiliates, we predict
the effect of political risk on leverage to be negative. When we model leverage as a linear
function of political risk, the positive effect that we predict for the majority of affiliates of
German MNEs, prevails, as seen in Table 3. For the ownership share, the change from a
positive to a negative effect of political risk is predicted to take place for a much lower level
of political risk (about 0.13). This is in fact consistent with our hypothesis 5.
As outlined above, as a second strategy to capture different scenarios of political risk,
we try different measures of political risk. We use two measures taken from the ICRG
investment risk component (contract risk and repatriation risk) and three measures from
the Heritage Index (corruption, investment risk and property rights risk). Data on contract
risk and repatriation risk have only been available since 2001. Contract risk is defined as the
risk of unilateral contract modification or cancelation and, at worst, outright expropriation
of foreign owned assets. Repatriation risk captures to what extent profits can be transferred
out of the host country. Impediments include exchange controls, excessive bureaucracy and
a poor banking system. Corruption is defined as failure of the integrity of the system.
Investment risk measures the degree of restrictions on foreign investment, considering a
country's policies towards foreign investment, as well as its policies towards internal capital
flows. Property rights risk measures the lack of freedom to accumulate private property as
20
20
well as the risk to be expropriated.13
All measures have been recoded in such a way that first, higher values are associated
with higher risk and, second, they lie between 0 and 1. Table 5a shows that, as in Table
3, the influence of political risk on the ownership share is negative, for all types of political
risk measures considered. Interestingly, however, political risk can have either a positive
or a negative influence on the level of leverage, depending on the type of risk present
(Table 5b). It is positive for corruption, investment risk and property right risk. According
to our interpretation, this suggests that these three types of risk reduce the profitability
of the investment without significantly increasing the risk of bankruptcy. In contrast,
the coefficient is negative for contract risk, which seems to affect the chances to generate
revenues and hence increases the risk of bankruptcy. Surprisingly, it is also negative for
repatriation risk, even though this kind of political risk is more about the use of profits,
i.e., scenario 3, for which a positive coefficient is predicted. If, however, credits are taken at
home, not locally, the negative coefficient would make sense, because barriers to repatriation
profits would undermine the ability to repay credits.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we have investigated how MNEs adapt their capital structure choices in
the presence of political risk, both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis suggests
that, when it comes to assessing the potential effects of political risk, it is important to
distinguish different types of stakeholders and how these are affected by different political
measures. Only then is it possible to determine the optimal reaction of the investor to this
risky environment.
Almost by definition, any form of political risk negatively affects the profitability of a
MNE as a whole. The investor as one of the equity holders is residual claimant of the MNE.
Thus, it is not surprising that he will want to reduce his stake in the firm when political
risk becomes more severe.
But, as our analysis has shown, the effects are less straightforward for debt holders. If
debt holders expect debt service to become less likely, they have to adjust their interest

and Kane (2008).

rates. The larger the additional dead weight losses, the more costly debt financing becomes
and hence the more leverage is reduced. If, instead, debt service is less affected than the
returns to equity holders, then debt can act as a shield against political risk and the balance
shifts towards more debt finance relative to equity finance.
Why does it matter how political risk affects the multinational's choice of capital struc-
ture? Smaller ownership shares, for example, may negatively affect the governance structure
of the MNE because they typically lead to smaller incentives for controlling the firm effec-
tively. In addition, smaller ownership stakes could reduce the investor's incentive to transfer
necessary technology. These effects, though not explicitly modelled here, are well known
in the literature. Higher leverage, and hence higher risk of bankruptcy, on the other hand,
lead to higher dead weight losses arising from inefficient bankruptcy procedures and, in this
way, add to the social cost of political risk.
Thus, we would expect different kinds of inefficiencies and dead weight losses to prevail,
depending on how political risk affects equity holders relative to debt holders. If ownership
shares are reduced and leverage increases, one may have to face deteriorating governance
structures and more inefficiencies from increased risk of bankruptcy. If instead both own-
ership shares and leverage are reduced, it is mostly deteriorated governance structures one
has to expect.
