related quality of life and weight loss among overweight
and obese U.S. adults, 2001 to 2002. Obesity. 2006;14:
2042­2053.
Objective: To examine the prevalence and association of
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) with trying to lose
weight and with weight loss practices (eating fewer calories,
physical activity, and both) among overweight and obese
U.S. adults  20 years of age.
Research Methods and Procedures: This study used data
from the 2001 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey, a continuous annual survey of the civil-
ian non-institutionalized U.S. population. This analysis in-
cluded those  20 years of age with BMI  25 (n  2578)
who responded to four standard HRQOL measures that
assessed general health status and recent physical health,
mental health, and activity limitation.
Results: Among obese men, but not women, there were
significant increasing linear trends in the adjusted preva-
lence of trying to lose weight as physically unhealthy and
activity limitation days increased. Regardless of BMI or
HRQOL, reducing calories was a common weight loss
practice (66% to 86%). Except for recent activity limitation,
respondents with BMI  35 did not generally differ by
HRQOL level in the attainment of recommended physical
activity either alone or in combination with reduced calo-
ries, whereas those in the BMI 25 to 34.9 groups often
differed significantly by HRQOL level. Specifically, in-
creased unhealthy or activity limitation days were associ-
ated with reduced prevalence of attained physical activity.
Discussion: Our findings indicate an association between
trying to lose weight and a greater number of unhealthy
days reported by obese men, suggesting that these men may
be influenced by traditional clinical weight-loss counseling
that is prompted by weight and comorbidity, whereas
women had a high prevalence of trying to lose weight
irrespective of weight and HRQOL. Assessment of
HRQOL, especially measures that evaluate physical do-
mains, could provide subjective information to assist with
weight counseling.
Key words: BMI, mental health, physical health, activity
limitation, health status
Introduction
The first goal of Healthy People 2010, a comprehensive,
nationwide health promotion and disease prevention agenda
for the first decade of the 21st century, is to help individuals
of all ages increase life expectancy and improve quality of
life (1). Aspects of quality of life that can be shown to affect
health, either physical or mental, are referred to as health-
related quality of life (HRQOL).1 HRQOL and its determi-
nants have been explored since the 1970s and include mea-
surement of subjective components of human function and
well-being (2).

Obesity affects important aspects of HRQOL, including
physical health, emotional well-being, and psychosocial
function (3­9). Both cross-sectional and longitudinal stud-
ies have shown HRQOL to diminish as BMI increases from
normal to obese (3,5­7,10­19). Furthermore, HRQOL is
used to measure the efficacy of treatment for obesity (20­
22).
Previous studies of HRQOL and of attempts to lose
weight have sampled individuals who sought intensive
weight loss treatment in a university or hospital setting
(8,11,23). However, such persons could have had signifi-
cantly more psychological or affective disorders, including
eating disorders (8,24), or been predominantly older white
women from higher sociodemographic groups (11,23).
Therefore, the results of these studies might not be gener-
alizable to the overall obese population. HRQOL and self-
report of trying to lose weight have not been studied in a
nationally representative sample of overweight and obese
adults.
Although many Americans try to lose weight (25­27), the
cues for these attempts are not fully understood. Motivation
for weight loss can include perceived appearance or the
desire to improve health (28,29). Research has shown that
not all overweight or obese individuals perceive that their
health is poor or are interested in losing weight (30). A need
for research that explores the role of HRQOL in an indi-
vidual's decision to try to lose weight has been suggested
(4). Treatment algorithms for obesity are based on body size
and comorbidities, factors that may not motivate all indi-
viduals to lose weight. Because perceived need and moti-
vation for weight loss vary, tools used to evaluate readiness
to lose weight also need to vary. HRQOL has been sug-
gested as a tool to identify patients suitable for different
weight loss interventions (7). If HRQOL were found to be
associated with trying to lose weight and specific weight
loss practices, then its assessment during a physician visit
might provide useful information for weight counseling.
The objectives of this study were to examine the preva-
lence of four brief self-reported HRQOL measures (general
health status, recent physical health, recent mental health,
and recent activity limitation) and their association with an
individual's intention to lose weight and weight loss prac-
tices (reduced calories, recommended physical activity, or
both) in a nationally representative sample of overweight
and obese adults stratified by BMI (25 to 29.9, 30 to 34.9,
and 35).
Research Methods and Procedures
We used data from the 2001 to 2002 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a continuous
annual survey of the civilian non-institutionalized U.S. pop-
ulation (this analysis used adults  20 years of age).
NHANES uses a complex, stratified, multistage probability
sampling design, and details of sample design and interview
procedures have been published previously (31). Participant
identification was based on census information regarding
age, gender, and racial/ethnic background within randomly
selected household units. Questionnaires were administered
to NHANES participants both at home and in a Mobile
Examination Center, and measurements of height and
weight were done in the Mobile Examination Center.
Outcomes and Covariates
HRQOL Measures. Measures of HRQOL included four
questions referred to as the Healthy Days measures (32)
developed for population surveillance by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1993 for use in
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. These
questions were found to have moderate to excellent reliabil-
ity from retest reliability studies (33,34). The Healthy Days
measures were tested for validity by comparison with self-
reported socioeconomic and health-related data (35) and by
comparison with the Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form-36 (36). General health status was assessed with the
question, "Would you say that in general your health is
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?". Recent physical
health was assessed by asking, "Now thinking about your
physical health, which includes physical illness and injury,
for how many days during the past 30 days was your
physical health not good?". Recent mental health was as-
sessed by asking, "Now thinking about your mental health,
which includes stress, depression, and problems with emo-
tions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your
mental health not good?". Recent physical and mental
health were correlated with the physical assessment and
mental health scales of the Short Form-36 (36). An individ-
ual's ability to function is a useful indicator of disability
(37,38). Recent activity limitation was assessed with the
question, "During the past 30 days, for about how many
days did poor physical or mental health keep you from
doing your usual activities, such as self-care, work, school,
or recreation?".
To facilitate clinical interpretation and consistency with
previous research that used the Healthy Days measures,
each of the four HRQOL measurements were summarized
into a categorical variable with three levels. General health
status was categorized as excellent/very good, good, and
fair/poor. Recent physical health, mental health, and activity
limitation were categorized into no days, 1 to 13 days, and
14 to 30 days.
Trying to Lose Weight. A series of weight history ques-
tions was asked to determine who was trying to lose weight.
Respondents were initially asked, "What do you weigh
without clothes or shoes?" and "How much did you weigh
a year ago?". Based on these self-reported weight questions,
if respondents lost 10 pounds from a year ago, they were
asked, "Was the change between your current weight and
your weight a year ago intentional?". Those who said yes

OBESITY Vol. 14 No. 11 November 2006 2043
were defined as trying to lose weight. Respondents who had
not lost 10 pounds were asked, "During the past 12
months, have you tried to lose weight?". Those who an-
swered yes were also defined as trying to lose weight.
Weight Loss Practices. Recommended dietary and phys-
ical activity weight loss practices were assessed in accor-
dance with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's
Clinical Guidelines for the Identification, Evaluation, and
Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults (39). The
dietary recommendation for weight loss is to consume fewer
calories. Caloric restriction was determined by the question,
"How did you try to lose weight?". Respondents who an-
swered that they "ate less food" or "switched to foods with
lower calories" were categorized as meeting this recommen-
dation. We did not consider any other practice as meeting
this dietary recommendation. To meet the physical activity
recommendation, the respondent must have reported at least
moderate-intensity physical activity  5 times/wk for an
average of 30 minutes per bout, vigorous-intensity phys-
ical activity  3 times/wk for an average of 20 minutes
per bout, or both during the previous month (40). Survey
respondents who met both the reduced calorie and physical
activity criteria were categorized as meeting both recom-
mendations.
Overweight and Obesity. Overweight and obesity were
defined using BMI. BMI [weight (kilograms)/height
(meters)2] was calculated using measured height and
weight. BMI was categorized as overweight (25.0 to 29.9),
obesity class I (30.0 to 34.9), and obesity class II or III
(35.0).
Demographic and Comorbidity. Covariates of interest
were sex, age in years (continuous), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic), educa-
tional attainment (less than high school, high school grad-
uate, more than high school), smoking status (current,
former, never), and self-reported comorbidities (type 2 di-
abetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, and
arthritis). The NHANES Hispanic sample was primarily
Mexican American but included other Hispanic groups
(Mexican American  572, other Hispanic  100). Smok-
ing was defined as current (100 lifetime cigarettes and
currently smoking), former (100 lifetime cigarettes and
not currently smoking), and never (100 lifetime ciga-
rettes). Obesity-related comorbidity questions were used to
develop a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk variable (yes/
no) and other comorbidity (OC) variable (yes/no). Respon-
dents were classified with CVD risk if they had been told by
a doctor or other health professional that they had hyper-
tension or high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, or
diabetes (other than during pregnancy). Respondents were
classified with OC if they had been told by a doctor or other
health professional that they had arthritis or asthma and
during the past 12 months had experienced an episode of
asthma or had an asthma attack.
Analytical Sample
All NHANES 2001 to 2002 sample respondents  20
years of age with BMI  25 who participated in the exam-
ination component of the survey were eligible for inclusion
in the analysis (n  3184). Respondents with incomplete
weight history (n  204), pregnancy (n  208), or other
race/ethnicity, incomplete education, smoking status, or co-
morbidity data (n  194) were excluded. The final analytic
sample size was 2578 (1205 women, 1373 men) (Table 1).
Statistical Analysis
Means and frequencies were calculated to describe the
population. Linear trend tests of adjusted prevalence esti-
mates were calculated to determine the presence of a linear
relationship between HRQOL measures and the prevalence
of trying to lose weight or the prevalence of using a specific
weight loss practice. Specifically, trend tests consisted of
pair-wise comparison of the conditional marginal propor-
tions of the extreme levels of each HRQOL measure fol-
lowed by a quadratic test for deviation from linear trend in
the conditional marginal proportions over the three HRQOL
levels using polynomial coefficients (41). Logistic regres-
sion was used to examine whether HRQOL measures were
independently associated with trying to lose weight and
with specific weight loss practices. Before running regres-
sion models, potential effect modifiers were tested, and sex
was found to modify two HRQOL measures at p  0.05 and
two measures at p  0.22. Sex has been found to modify the
association between BMI and trying to lose weight (25­27)
but not the association with weight loss practices; therefore,
for the analyses of HRQOL and trying to lose weight,
logistic regression models were developed to control for
confounders (age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, CVD
risk, OC) stratified by sex and BMI category. The analyses
of HRQOL and weight loss practices were stratified by BMI
only, and sex was added to the logistic regression model.
SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and
SUDAAN (version 9.0; Research Triangle Institute, Re-
search Triangle Park, NC) were used for the statistical
analysis to account for the complex sampling design. Two-
sided hypotheses were assessed, and statistical significance
was set at p  0.05 for all comparisons.
Results
Overall, the weighted sample was 46.7% women and
53.3% men. The mean age was 51.8 years, and the mean
BMI was 31.0 kg/m2. The overall prevalence of trying to
lose weight in the past 12 months among this overweight
and obese population was 50.7% (58.8% of women and
43.8% of men).
The prevalence of trying to lose weight was examined
by the four HRQOL measures stratified by sex and BMI
category. The prevalence of trying to lose weight ranged

widely by HRQOL measure and BMI from 40% to 70%
for women (Figure 1, A to D) and 31% to 92% for men
(Figure 2, A to D). Overweight women who reported good
general health status were one-half as likely to be trying to
lose weight as those who reported excellent or very good
general health status, odds ratio  0.52 (Figure 1A). Men
with BMI 30 to 34.9 had a significant increasing trend in
the adjusted prevalence of trying to lose weight with in-
creased physically unhealthy days and activity limitation
days (Figure 2, B and D); similarly, men with BMI  35
had a significant increasing trend in the adjusted prevalence
of trying to lose weight with increasing numbers of activity
limitation days (Figure 2D).
Among those trying to lose weight, specific weight loss
practices were examined by level of HRQOL stratified by
BMI category with women and men combined (Figures 3 to
5). Overall, the prevalence of reducing calorie intake ranged
from 66% to 86% and was relatively common regardless of
HRQOL measure (Figure 3). The only HRQOL measure
associated with using reduced calories was recent mental
health (Figure 3C). Among men and women with BMI 
35, a significant increasing trend in the prevalence of using
reduced calories was observed as mentally unhealthy days
increased (Figure 3C).
Overall, the prevalence of attaining physical activity rec-
ommendations ranged from 4% to 55% (Figure 4). In each

BMI category, the highest frequency of achieving recom-
mended physical activity was usually found for those with
the best health (excellent or very good and no unhealthy or
activity limitation days) (Figure 4, A to D). Significant
decreasing linear trends in the prevalence of meeting phys-
ical activity recommendations and correspondingly signifi-
cant adjusted odds ratios were observed as health declined
in BMI 30 to 34.9 subgroups for all four HRQOL measures
(Figure 4, A to D). Among overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9)
respondents, decreasing trends were found for recent phys-
ical health (Figure 4B) and activity limitation (Figure 4D),
and among those with BMI  35, a decreasing trend was
found for activity limitation (Figure 4D).
Finally, we examined the combination of reduced calo-
ries and achievement of recommended physical activity.
Overall, the prevalence of this combination ranged from
4% to 41% (Figure 5). Similar to recommended physical
activity alone, numerous significant linear trends and cor-
respondingly significant adjusted odds ratios were found
(Figure 5). Specifically, for poorer HRQOL levels, signifi-
cant decreasing trends in the prevalence of reduced calories
and recommended physical activity were found among
those with BMI 25 to 29.9 for recent physical health
(Figure 5B), BMI 30 to 34.9 for all HRQOL measures
(Figure 5, A to D), and BMI  35 for recent activity
limitation (Figure 5D).

Discussion
This study explored HRQOL, trying to lose weight, and
weight loss practices in a nationally representative sample
of overweight and obese adults. Our results generally indi-
cated that among obese men, less healthy levels of HRQOL
were increasingly associated with trying to lose weight.
However, among women, a generally equal and large pro-
portion (60%) reported trying to lose weight across all
BMI and HRQOL categories. These findings suggest that
men link poor health to a greater body weight and try to lose
weight based on their subjective evaluation of poor health as
measured by HRQOL, whereas women try to lose weight
based on reasons other than health and independently of
HRQOL. A study of middle-aged overweight and obese
women found that dissatisfaction with body size was the
strongest predictor of trying to lose weight, and consistent
with our findings, general health status was not a significant
predictor of trying to lose weight (42).
Among those trying to lose weight, recent physical health
and activity limitation were most consistently associated
with attainment of recommended levels of physical activity.
Consistent with others (43­46), we found that individuals
with the fewest unhealthy days had the greatest likelihood
of attaining the recommended amount of physical activity.
Cross-sectional analysis of adults found independent asso-
ciations between recommended physical activity and health-
ier or better levels of HRQOL (43­45). Among generally
healthy older men and women who did not engage in a

regular exercise or diet program, being more physically
active and having less body fat was associated with better
HRQOL (46). In our study, except in the case of recent
activity limitation, those with BMI  35 had the lowest
prevalence of physical activity and did not differ by
HRQOL status in the attainment of recommended physical
activity, whereas attaining recommended physical activity
was associated with HRQOL for those in the BMI 25 to 34.9
groups. A possible explanation for lower prevalence of
physical activity in the BMI  35 group would be that
individuals who report even the best health still have sig-
nificant physical limitations that prevent their participation
in physical activity, but further investigation is needed.
Use of reduced calories for weight loss was common and
not generally related to HRQOL, but there was a significant
trend among respondents with BMI  35 to use fewer
calories as the number of mentally unhealthy days increased
(Figure 3C). Although research on eating behavior,
HRQOL, and obesity is limited, others have observed that
unrestrained and binge eating are associated with poor
HRQOL (47). Our study did not assess these aspects of
eating behavior.
Several study limitations must be considered. The cross-
sectional design limits conclusions regarding causal rela-
tionships, so it is impossible to determine the extent and
direction of the association between HRQOL and weight

loss behaviors. In addition, the extensive set of a priori
associations among multiple measures of HRQOL and try-
ing to lose weight resulted in the examination of 96 linear
trend and logistic regression models; therefore, five signif-
icant results would be expected by chance. Our results
included four significant findings for these tests of trying to
lose weight (one for women and three for men), and we
cannot rule out chance as an explanation; therefore, caution
must be exercised against inferring causality for these spe-
cific associations in the absence of replication in other data
sets. Similarly, among those who were trying to lose weight,
144 statistical tests were performed, and seven significant
results would be expected by chance. Significant results for
the three weight control practices totaled 35, and the ma-
jority (34) were for the physical activity variables. Also, the
time frames of the questions were somewhat different. The
HRQOL questions and physical activity questions were
asked about the previous 30 days, whereas weight history
was asked about the previous 12 months. By definition,
27% of respondents categorized as trying to lose weight in
the previous 12 months had lost 10 pounds, and this
weight loss could result in a non-differential misclassifica-
tion of their HRQOL due to potential impact of weight loss
on HRQOL; however, research has not always found that
HRQOL changes with weight loss (16­17). Because the
HRQOL measures are categorical, misclassification of the
extreme categories would bias results toward the null, but
misclassification of the intermediate category might bias the

results toward or away from the null. All information except
height and weight was self reported. Self-report is often
influenced by social desirability (48). For example, persons
with known disabilities reported significantly fewer days'
limitation from in-person vs. telephone interviews (49).
Physical activity may be underestimated because only lei-
sure-time activities were ascertained (no occupational or
transportation activity), and no information was collected
on actual caloric intake or specific food behaviors such as
unrestrained or binge eating practices.
The greatest strength of our study is the use of a nation-
ally representative sample rather than selected obese pa-
tients who sought medical care or weight loss treatment.
Another strength is the use of standard HRQOL measures
(32,37) and multiple categories for the HRQOL measures, a
methodological recommendation from previous obesity
HRQOL research (7). Rather than having a separate cate-
gory for those with no limitation or poor health (0 days),
prior research often dichotomized the measures (i.e., excel-
lent, very good, or good vs. fair or poor, and 14 vs.  14
days). Adjusting for the influence of obesity-related comor-
bidities allowed determination of independent associations
among HRQOL measures, trying to lose weight, and weight
loss practices.
Conclusions
Numerous factors are associated with the decision to try
to lose weight, ranging from appearance to attainment of
improved health (26,27). Our findings suggest that men
increasingly try to lose weight as they become heavier and
less healthy, whereas women try to lose weight irrespective
of BMI and perceived health. Traditional clinical counsel-
ing to lose weight is prompted by physical parameters,
specifically body weight or obesity-associated comorbidi-
ties, which seem to be consistent with our findings for men,
but not for women. Generally, at worse levels of general
health status and higher numbers of unhealthy or activity
limitation days, the likelihood of attaining recommended
physical activity levels or combining reduced calories and
physical activity diminished. Future longitudinal studies
might explore these associations using obesity-specific
HRQOL instruments and generic instruments. Evaluation of
these associations in cognitive studies and clinical settings
could enhance understanding of patients' subjective expe-
riences of being overweight or obese and what health lim-
itations they perceive beyond the physical measures and
comorbidities that are evident. Knowledge of these associ-
ations may help physicians develop realistic goals for their
patients with BMI  25 and provide more tailored, sensitive
weight control guidance.
