Abstract
Objective: This study was performed to investigate the effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on
healing in osteoporotic fractures via a phospholipase C (PLC)-independent pathway and explore
the mechanism of PTH-mediated bone formation.
Methods: Ninety-six 12-week-old C57BL/6J female mice underwent bilateral ovariectomy. One
month later, the lower third of the femur was fractured and the mice were treated using saline,
PTH(1-28), PTH(1-34), zoledronic acid (ZA), PTH(1-28)þZA, and PTH(1-34)þZA. The mice
were killed at weeks 2 and 4 in each group. Biomechanical testing and micro-computed
tomography were performed.
Results: The formation and strength of the callus increased in all but the saline group. The mice
treated with PTH(1-34) showed a significantly higher ultimate bending force, bending rigidity, bone
mineral density, percent bone volume, and trabecular thickness than those treated with PTH(1-28).
The PTH(1-34)þZA group demonstrated the greatest improvements in the ultimate bending
force, bending rigidity, bone mineral density, and relative bone volume.
Conclusions: PTH can promote fracture healing and callus hardness in ovariectomized mice by
increasing callus formation and reconstructing trabecular bone via a PLC-independent pathway.
PTH combined with ZA has a cumulative effect on the healing of fractures in ovariectomized mice.

Introduction
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) promotes bone
formation1 and plays a critical role in
maintaining the balance of calcium and
phosphorus metabolism and regulating
bone synthesis and catabolism. In clinical
treatment, PTH has been proven to have a
reliable anti-osteoporosis effect; it is cur-
rently among the first-choice anti-osteo-
porosis drugs.
Experimental studies in animals and
humans have demonstrated that intermittent
administration of low doses of PTH by daily
subcutaneous injection effectively stimulates
cancellous bone formation, whereas con-
tinuous high-dose application of the hor-
mone promotes bone resorption. Therefore,
achieving the desired effect of PTH requires
careful dosage, and the optimal regimen has
not yet been fully elucidated.2 Whether PTH
can promote fracture healing to accelerate
rehabilitation of patients with fractures has
been widely researched. Previous studies
have shown that different doses of PTH
can lead to different effects because binding
of PTH to the PTH receptor activates
different signaling pathways. It is now clear
that the biological role of PTH is mainly
achieved through activation of three signal-
ing pathways: the cyclic AMP/protein kinase
A (cAMP/PKA), phospholipase C/protein
kinase C (PLC/PKC), and non-PLC/PKC
pathways.3
However, the roles of PTH signaling
pathways in bone are complex, and the
specific role of the non-PLC/PKC signaling
pathway in bone formation is not well
understood. Its mechanism in bone metab-
olism requires further study.
The aims of this study were to elucidate
the effects of PTH on osteoporotic fracture
healing via the non-PLC/PKC signaling
pathway and the mechanism of PTH in
promoting bone formation. This informa-
tion will help in the development of PTH-
based bone-formation drugs with higher
efficacy and fewer side effects.
Methods
Experimental animals
In total, 110 12-week-old C57BL/6 female
mice purchased from the Guangzhou
Animal Experimental Center were used in
this study. The average weight was 19 to
20 g. All mice were kept in their cages for a
1-week acclimatization period. An osteo-
porotic fracture model was then established
at 13 weeks of age. During the experiment,
the animals were handled based on
Guidance Opinion about Kindly Treating
Animals, released by the Ministry of Science
and Technology in 2015.
Animal model
The osteoporosis model was established via
a previously described protocol of bilateral
ovariectomy (OVX).4 Penicillin was injected
intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days.
Four weeks after OVX, all mice received
inhalational anesthesia using isoflurane gas
(300 mL/min), then underwent an incision
on the left thigh and blunt separation of the
muscle and soft tissue to expose the left
femur. Intramedullary fixation of the femur
was performed by reverse insertion of
a needle (' ¼ 0.45 mm) from the knee.
A transverse osteotomy was then made at
the distal one-third of the left femur.
Penicillin was injected intraperitoneally for
3 consecutive days. Wound healing was
routinely monitored.
Pharmaceutical treatment
After the fracture operation, all 96 mice were
randomly divided into 6 groups. The follow-
ing pharmaceutical interventions (subcutane-
ous injections) commenced from
postoperative day 3: the control group
received an equivalent dose of vehicle; the
PTH(1-28) group received PTH(1-28) at
400 mg/kg five times a week for 4 consecutive
weeks; the PTH(1-34) group received
PTH(1-34) at 40mg/kg five times a week for
Li et al. 1201
4 consecutive weeks; the zoledronic acid (ZA)
group received a bolus dose of ZA at 100 mg/
kg; the PTH(1-28)þZA group received
PTH(1-28) at 400 mg/kg five times a week
for 4 consecutive weeks plus a bolus dose of
ZA at 100 mg/kg; and the PTH(1-34)þZA
group received PTH(1-34) at 40mg/kg five
times a week for 4 consecutive weeks plus a
bolus dose of ZA at 100 mg/kg.5,6 The PTH
was sourced from Bachem (Torrance, CA),
and the ZA was sourced from Novartis
Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland).
Specimen collection
The mice were killed at weeks 2 and 4 after
fracture, and the left femur was collected for
analysis.
Micro-computed tomography examination
The soft tissue and muscles surrounding the
fractured femurs were carefully peeled, and
the needle was removed. These specimens
were immersed in 10% formalin for 48
hours, then removed and stored in 70%
ethanol at 4C. The fractured femurs were
scanned using a micro-computed tomog-
raphy (micro-CT) system (SkyScan 1176;
Bruker, Billerica, MA) while wrapped in
moist tissue and placed in a sample scanning
holder (Figure 1). The long axis of the femur
was aligned with the long axis of the scanner.
The scanning system was set to 50 kV, 98 mA,
and a 9 -mm isotropic voxel size. After the
scan, the regions showing new callus for-
mation were selected using micro-CT soft-
ware, and the following parameters were
quantified: bone mineral density (BMD),
bone volume (BV), percent bone volume
(BV/TV), mean trabecular thickness
(Tb.Th), and structural model index.
Biomechanical testing
Following micro-CT scanning, the left
femur underwent biomechanical testing at
weeks 2 and 4 after fracture (Figure 2).
Three-point bending on the fractured cal-
luses was performed using a commercial
material testing system ElectroPuls (Instron
E1000; Instron, Norwood, MA). During the
test, the span of the fulcrum was set at 6 mm,
and the load was applied vertically at the
midpoint of the callus at a speed of 2 mm/
min. The ultimate bending force was rec-
orded at the callus breakage, and the
bending rigidity was calculated according
to the force and displacement curves.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean Æ standard
deviation. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp.,

ance was used to analyze mean values in
each treatment group. If differences were
observed between the groups, the least sig-
nificant difference test was performed
(a ¼ 0.05).
Results
Animals
Fourteen mice were excluded from the ana-
lysis due to infection, anesthesia, or dis-
placement of the intramedullary fixation
after fracture. Eight mice were left for
evaluation in each group at each observa-
tion time.
Micro-CT evaluation
Statistically significant differences in BMD,
BV, BV/TV, and Tb.Th were observed
among the groups (P 0.05), while no sig-
nificant difference in the structural model
index was observed. The changes in BMD in
each treatment group at weeks 2 and 4 are
shown in Figure 3(a). The BMD was signifi-
cantly higher in the PTH(1-34) than
PTH(1-28) group at week 2 (0.055 Æ
0.0027) and week 4 (0.062 Æ 0.002)
(P < 0.05). The BMD was not significantly
different between the PTH(1-34)þZA group
and the other groups at week 2 (0.062 Æ
0.010); however, the BMD was significantly

(P < 0.05).
The changes in BV, BV/TV, and Tb.Th in
each group at weeks 2 and 4 are shown in
Figure 3(b)-(d). The BV/TV was not signifi-
cantly different between the PTH(1-34) and
PTH(1-28) groups at week 2 (40.25 Æ 5.5 vs.
46.6 Æ 6.62, respectively); however, the
BV/TV was significantly higher in the
PTH(1-34) than PTH(1-28) group at week
4 (P < 0.05). The Tb.Th was not significantly
different between the PTH(1-34) and
PTH(1-28) groups. During the 4-week
observation period, PTH(1-34) had a sig-
nificantly stronger effect on BV than did
PTH(1-28) (P < 0.05). At week 2, the BV
was significantly higher in the PTH(1-34)þ
ZA and ZA groups than in the groups
treated with PTH alone (P < 0.05). At
week 4, the ZA group exhibited the highest
BV (P < 0.05). At week 2, the BV/TV in the
PTH(1-34)þZA group was only higher than
that in the control and PTH(1-28) groups
(P < 0.05), while at week 4, the PTH(1-34)þ
ZA group demonstrated the highest BV/TV
(P < 0.05). At weeks 2 and 4, no signifi-
cant differences in Tb.Th were observed
between the PTH(1-34) and PTH(1-34)þ
ZA groups.
Biomechanical testing
The samples underwent biomechanical test-
ing after micro-CT scanning. The results are
presented as the ultimate bending force and
bending rigidity. As shown in Tables 1
and 2, the least significant difference test
was performed when the two indices were
demonstrably different between groups. At
week 4, the PTH(1-34)þZA group showed a
1.3-fold and 2.2-fold higher bending rigidity
and 1.2-fold and 2.0-fold higher ultimate
bending force than the PTH(1-34) and
ZA groups, respectively. Moreover, the
PTH(1-34) group demonstrated a 1.2-fold
and 1.3-fold higher bending rigidity and
ultimate bending force than the PTH(1-28)
group, respectively.
Discussion
Fracture healing is a complex process, and
factors that influence this process include the
local blood supply, age, health status, and
iatrogenic factors.7 The rate of nonunion or
delayed union of fractures is about 5% to
10% and reaches 20% in patients with
osteoporosis.8 PTH not only regulates the
formation, transformation, proliferation,
and apoptosis of osteoblasts but also

promotes the bone resorption function of
osteoclasts; it is also an important regula-
tory hormone of calcium metabolism
in vivo. PTH regulates osteoblasts by bind-
ing to PTH receptor I on the cell surface,
which can activate multiple downstream
signaling pathways. Moreover, PTH indir-
ectly regulates osteoclasts via its action on
osteoblasts.9 Jouishomme et al.10 reported
that PTH(29-32) activated PKC on the cell
membrane of ROS17/2.8 cells, while
PTH(1-31) did not have this effect. This
finding indicates that the non-PLC/PKC
signaling pathway is relevant to the
PTH(29-32) segment. However, the specific
signaling mediator molecules and corres-
ponding biological mechanism of the non-
PLC/PKC pathway are not well understood.
McDonald et al.11 found that bolus ZA
treatment (100 mg/kg) increased the hard
callus bone mineral content more than
weekly ZA treatment (five weekly doses of
20 mg/kg). However, regardless of the
method of delivery, there is no evidence
that ZA can promote complete fracture
healing. Some studies12,13 have shown that
ZA does not delay endochondral fracture
repair and allows hard callus remodeling to
proceed in the long term, albeit more slowly
than normal fracture healing. Moreover,
some scholars14 have found that PTH
combined with bisphosphonates had no
significant effect on osteoporosis. However,
the doses and injection methods in these
studies were inconsistent. PTH combined
with ZA was recently shown to have stron-
ger effects on fracture healing than either
monotherapy after OVX in rats.15 The ZA
was administered in a small dose via weekly
injections, and PTH was injected three times
a week. According to other studies,5,6 we
explored the non-PLC/PKC signaling path-
way and observed whether it has a stronger
effect on bone formation by using an opti-
mal dose of PTH [PTH(1-34) at 40 mg/kg
five times a week] and ZA (bolus dose of
100 mg/kg).
Different signaling-selective PTH peptide
analogs and commonly used bisphospho-
nates were compared with regard to their
mechanism of action in bone tissue repair to
provide more information on the non-PLC/
PKC signaling pathway. Bilateral OVX,
which results in a decline in the estrogen
level, is a classic method by which to estab-
lish osteoporosis in animal models. In the
past, femoral fracture in experimental ani-
mals was produced manually, but the oper-
ation was difficult. Since then, specialized
equipment to establish femoral fractures in
mice has been designed.16 Despite its high
repeatability, the operation is more cumber-
some. Furuta et al.17 used a wire saw to
create transverse fractures in the femurs of
male mice, and the fractures were directly
visualized and fixed with intramedullary
nails. The fixation strength of osteoporotic
fractures of middle-aged female mice has yet
to be verified. In the present study, the
method used to fracture the lower third of
the femur under direct visualization and
fixation with an intramedullary nail in con-
junction with OVX has the characteristics of
reliable fixation, technical simplicity, and
repeatability.
Micro-CT examination and biomechan-
ical testing were performed on the callus to
study the fracture healing in each experi-
mental group. PTH(1-34) treatment had a
stronger effect on BMD, BV, BV/TV, and
Tb.Th than PTH(1-28) treatment. This indi-
cates that while PTH(1-28) activates the
cAMP/PKA and PLC/PKC signaling path-
ways, PTH(1-34) further increases the
number of bony trabeculae and strength of
the callus and promotes healing of osteo-
porotic fractures through its action on the
non-PLC/PKC signaling pathway. Among
all treatment groups, PTH(1-34)þZA treat-
ment had the strongest effect on BMD,
BV/TV, Tb.Th, ultimate bending force, and
bending rigidity. In addition, at week 2, the
PTH(1-34)þZA and ZA groups showed a
higher BV than those groups treated with a
Li et al. 1205
single drug. At week 4, the ZA group
demonstrated the highest BV, which could
be explained by the antiresorptive properties
of ZA. The PTH(1-34)þZA group also
demonstrated a high BV, but it was lower
than that in the ZA group, indicating that
PTH can promote cancellous bone forma-
tion in the bone callus and remodeling of
trabecular bone. At week 2, PTH(1-34)þZA
and ZA treatment had a similar effect on
BV/TV; however, the PTH(1-34)þZA group
had the highest BV/TV at week 4.
PTH(1-34)þZA treatment produced the
most bone mass, indicating that ZA may
inhibit bone resorption while PTH promotes
bone formation. The combination of the two
drugs not only decreases the loss of the bone
mass of the callus but can also generate new
bone tissue. Consequently, this group
showed the maximum increase in bone
mass. The PTH(1-34)þZA group had the
greatest callus intensity, which may be
dependent on increasing the amount of
callus to improve early callus strength,
while the later callus strength is mainly
dependent on callus remodeling. All findings
of this study show that PTH(1-34) combined
with ZA can increase the callus quantity,
enhance callus remodeling, improve bone
morphology, and promote bone growth via
multiple signaling pathways in an osteopor-
otic fracture animal model.
In summary, PTH can promote fracture
healing after OVX in mice by increasing the
amount of callus and remodeling the callus
via a non-PLC/PKC signaling pathway and
increasing the callus hardness. Moreover,
PTH combined with ZA had synergistic
effects on fracture healing after OVX in
mice. However, the observation time of this
study was only 4 weeks; a longer period of
observation is required to more fully under-
stand the effects of monotherapy or com-
bined therapy. In addition, these results
were obtained in mice and may not translate
fully to the human body. Clinical trials are
required to prove the effectiveness of this
treatment in patients. Additional cellular or
molecular studies may cast more light on the
mechanism behind these therapies. PTH
combined with ZA has a synergistic effect
on fracture healing in mice. Future studies
should be performed to explore different
doses and different injection frequencies of
PTH and ZA for fracture healing.
