A National 5-Year Follow-up of Treatment Outcomes
for Cocaine Dependence
D. Dwayne Simpson, PhD; George W. Joe, EdD; Kirk M. Broome, PhD
Background: Long-term (5-year) outcomes of
community treatment for cocaine dependence were ex-
amined in relation to problem severity at treatment
entry and treatment exposure throughout the follow-up
period.
Methods: Interviews were conducted at 1 and 5 years
after treatment for 708 subjects (from 45 programs in 8
cities) who met DSM-III-R criteria for cocaine depen-
dence when admitted to treatment in 1991-1993. Pri-
mary outcome measures included cocaine use and ar-
rests. Self-reported cocaine use showed high overall
agreement with urine (79% agreement) and hair (80%
agreement) toxicology analyses.
Results: Weekly cocaine use was reported by 25% of the
sample at 5 years, slightly higher than the 21% at 1 year.
Similarly, 26% had cocaine detected in urine specimens at
follow-up and 18% reported having been arrested. Poorer
long-term outcomes were related to higher problem sever-
ity at treatment admission and low treatment exposure.
Conclusions: Thelargedecreasesincocaineuse1yearaf-
ter treatment discharge were sustained during the 5-year
follow-up. Severity of drug and psychosocial problems at

THE 2001 ANNUAL report of
the Office of National Drug
Control Policy (Washing-
ton, DC)1 notes that the
high level of past-month co-
caine use in the United States remained
stable during the 1990s, but the number of
new users rose by 37% during this period.
Cocaine is the illegal drug mentioned most
often in emergency department overdose
admissionrecords--roughlyequaltoheroin
and marijuana combined--and is de-
tected consistently in the urine specimens
frommorethanonethirdofarresteestested
in this country each year. Behavioral thera-
pies have proven to be effective treat-
ments for cocaine addiction, particularly
those using a manual-guided combina-
tion of intensive individual plus group drug
counseling.2 At the individual patient level,
outcomes are associated with the severity
of drug and related problems, type of treat-
ment setting, and length of stay.3-9
Recent findings from the third na-
tional evaluation of treatment effective-
ness, funded by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA) (Bethesda, Md), show
that patients who are cocaine dependent
and have high problem severity index (PSI)
scores, based on background informa-
tion obtained at treatment intake, have sig-
nificantly better 1-year outcomes if treated
for a minimum of 90 days in long-term
residential (LTR) (usually intensive thera-
peutic community) programs.9 Similar
findings apply to adolescents studied as
part of this same project.10 Patients with
moderate levels of problem severity can be
treated with comparable effectiveness in
either LTR or outpatient drug-free (ODF)
treatment if they stay for a minimum of
90 days. Treatment setting and duration
are less important for patients with low
problem severity, for whom less expen-
sive and shorter-term outpatient services
seem to be the most cost-effective choice.
Comparable results have been reported for
patients who are addicted to opiates and
treated in methadone programs.11
Because the widespread use of co-
caine began in the 1980s and it has taken
years to develop appropriate interven-
tions and demonstrate their effectiveness,
long-term treatment follow-up studies of
cocaine-dependent patients have been rare.
The NIDA-funded Drug Abuse Treatment
Outcome Studies (DATOS) therefore in-
cluded 5-year follow-up interviews as part
of its original scope of work. Our study
builds on a large body of treatment pro-
cess and outcome research already com-
pleted.12,13 Itextendsthescopeofthe1-year-

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
The original DATOS treatment population included a total
of10010patientsadmittedsequentially(during1991to1993)
to 96 drug treatment programs in 11 cities located through-
out the United States.14 Our study is limited to the subgroup
of 1648 patients with cocaine dependence included in a study
of outcomes in the first year after treatment.9 In selecting the
sample for 5-year follow-up interviews, 419 patients from 3
cities were excluded owing to small samples at 1 year (caus-
ing excessive costs per case for fieldwork), 163 were with-
out locator information (which was lost owing to a change
in the organization selected to conduct field interviews), 30
had moved away from the region in which they had origi-
nally received treatment, and 26 were institutionalized in a
setting where interview access was denied. These exclu-
sions left 1010 eligible patients, of whom 799 (79%) were lo-
cated; 708 (70%) were interviewed, 40 (4%) had died, and
32 (3%) refused the interview. The 708 interviewees repre-
sented 73% of the eligible, living patients.
At treatment admission (Table 1), the mean (SD) age
of the study sample was 33 (6.8) years, men composed 64%,
and African Americans composed 56%. Nearly three fourths
had a high school education or general educational devel-
opment test score equivalent and nearly half had never been
married. Also, almost half (46%) entered treatment with a
legal status (usually probation). In addition to cocaine use,
many were also dependent on alcohol (51%) or diagnosed
as having psychiatric impairment (48%).
INTAKE AND FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES
Each patient participated in a 2-part treatment intake inter-
view, with sessions occurring approximately 1 week apart.
Intake 1 addressed sociodemographic background, educa-
tion, alcohol and drug use history, illegal involvement, and
employment. In intake 2, assessment modules based on stan-
dard clinical instruments, such as the Diagnostic Interview
Schedule,16 Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view,17 and the Symptom Checklist 90,18 were administered;
an abbreviated set of treatment motivation scales were also
used.19 Interviews required an average of 90 minutes to com-
plete and were administered by research staff under the tech-
nical supervision of project field staff. Subjects were paid $10
for each intake interview.
The 5-year follow-up interviews were conducted by
the National Opinion Research Center of the University of
Chicago (Chicago, Ill) under contract with the DATOS Co-
ordinating Center. Trained professional interviewers re-
contacted patients approximately 5 years after they had left
their index treatment episode. Interviews averaged 2 hours
to complete and patients were compensated $15 for their
time. Interview content focused primarily on drug use and
other behaviors during the follow-up interval, with par-
ticular emphasis on the year immediately preceding the
5-year interview. Each interviewee was asked to provide a
urine and hair specimen for drug testing. Compensation
of $10 was provided for those biological samples.
TYPES OF TREATMENT
Questionnaires completed by the program director and
counseling supervisor served to describe the organiza-
tional structure, treatment protocol, policies, and staff at
participating DATOS facilities.20 Long-term residential
treatments were 24-hour residential facilities. They
included traditional therapeutic communities that oper-
ated with a highly structured emphasis on social confron-
tation combined with isolation from the outside commu-
nity (expected stays were for at least 6 months) and
modified therapeutic communities that had less program-
matic structure and shorter duration (4-6 months).21 Out-
patient drug-free programs varied more widely in their
therapeutic orientation and intensity levels. Individual
and group supportive counseling was emphasized, along
with brief reality therapy and practical problem solving;
some provided individual psychotherapy, 12-step meet-
ings, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Planned length of
stay was usually 6 months or longer (range, 3-12
months). Short-term inpatient (STI) treatments were
based primarily on the 12-step model and provided inten-
sive 24-hour exposure to the therapeutic milieu as an
instrument of change. Supportive group counseling was
used as well as lectures, work assignments, family coun-
seling, and daily reading groups focusing on 12-step prin-
ciples. The traditional 28-day inpatient duration for this
modality was shortened in most programs during this
study (owing to managed care and cost containment pres-
sures), averaging 25 days but ranging from 4 to 55 days.
Additional treatments received during the 5-year fol-
low-up were recorded in the follow-up interview, includ-
ing type of program and total length of stay; 275 (39%) of
708 respondents had returned for 1 or more treatments,
usually LTR or ODF. Their combined length of stay in these
treatments averaged 36 weeks, exceeding the 90-day treat-
ment threshold.
MEASURES
The PSI9 was defined using variables from the 2-part intake
interview that represented functional domains commonly re-
lated to treatment goals and outcome, similar to the do-
mains assessed in the Addiction Severity Index.22 The PSI is
a summed score of 7 problem areas at treatment intake, de-
fined as follows:
1. Multiple drug use: self-reported use of any 3 or more
drug categories in the year before intake.
2. Alcohol dependence: either a DSM-III-R diagnosis of
alcoholdependenceorself-reporteddailyconsumptionfor1
month or longer during the year before intake.
3. Criminal activity: being on probation/parole, await-
ing trial, or having a case pending at intake, or being in-
volved in illegal activities during the past year.
4. Unemployment: no work at a full-time job in the
year before intake.
5. Low social support: having several family mem-
bers or close friends who used illegal drugs or were incar-
cerated in the past year.

posure are reexamined at 5 years. Five-year outcomes are

ied previously and by cumulative treatment exposure dur-

depressionoranxiety,ascoreabovethemedianontheSymp-
tomChecklist90Depression(1.5)orAnxiety(1.0)scales,or
self-reported suicidal ideation (ie, having attempted suicide
or thought about killing self).
7. No insurance: having no private insurance (reflect-
ing low socioeconomic resources).
Meeting an adequate threshold for length of time in
drug treatment was indicated by spending 90 days or longer
in LTR or ODF treatment, which was shown to be the av-
erage length of stay after which therapeutic effects of treat-
ment began.23-26 The literature does not indicate threshold
effects of STI, but for the purpose of this study, 21 days
was accepted as a representative minimum.9 Additional treat-
ment following DATOS was also taken into account since
more than 1 treatment episode is frequently needed dur-
ing recovery, and treatment can have cumulative ef-
fects.27-29 Patients therefore were categorized as having (1)
below-threshold treatment, defined as having spent fewer
than 90 days in LTR or ODF treatment during DATOS (or
fewer than 21 days if in STI programs) and also having no
other reported treatment during the follow-up interval; (2)
above-threshold treatment, defined as having spent at least
90 days in LTR or ODF treatment during DATOS (or 21
days if in STI) or having returned to treatment during the
follow-up; and (3) current treatment at the time of the fol-
low-up interview.
Six subgroups of patients were identified, based on PSI
scores at intake and level of treatment exposure, and used to
testcombinedrelationshipsofthesevariableswith5-yearout-
comes. Patients assigned to the first group (low PSI scores,
above-threshold treatment) had PSI scores below 4 and met
the treatment threshold during DATOS or in the follow-up
period; the second group (low PSI scores with below-
threshold treatment) had a PSI score of less than 4 but treat-
ment exposure was below threshold. Patients in the third
group (moderate PSI scores, above-threshold treatment) had
PSI scores of 4 or 5, while those in the fourth group (high
PSI scores, above-threshold treatment) had PSI scores of 6
or 7; both had met the treatment threshold during DATOS
orhadreturnedtotreatmentafterwards.Thefifthgroup,those
with moderate-high PSI scores with below-threshold treat-
ment, consisted of patients with PSI scores of 4 or higher and
who left DATOS before meeting the treatment threshold and
had no subsequent treatment. All patients in the current-
treatment group at the 5-year follow-up were placed to-
gether in the sixth group, regardless of PSI score ( 60% had
4 or more problems) or prior treatment experience.
Comparisons of background variables for these groups
showed that patients in the 2 groups with low PSI scores were
older, more likely to be married, to be high school graduates
(or to have passed the general educational development test),
tobeemployed,andtohaveasupportivesocialnetwork(Table
1). In addition, they were less likely to be weekly users of al-
cohol or illegal drugs or to have a legal status and psychiat-
ric problems before entering treatment in DATOS.
5-YEAR OUTCOME MEASURES
Cocaine use was the primary outcome measure used for the
study,representedbyself-reportedweeklyuseaswellasurine
(n=599)andhair(n=546)specimenscollectedatthe5-year
follow-up and sent to a central laboratory for assays on co-
caine and other drugs. Fifteen percent of the sample did not
provide a urine specimen, usually because of inconvenience
attheinterviewlocation,institutionalrestrictions,orrefusal;
23% did not provide a hair specimen, often because of very
shorthairorshavedheads.Otherdruguseoutcomemeasures
included self-reports of heroin (weekly) and alcohol (daily)
use.Self-reportmeasuresofregularorfrequentdrugusehave

andhair(80%agreement)analyses.Thiswascomparablewith
the match between urine and hair (81% agreement). Of pa-
tientswhodeniedusingcocaineinthepastyear,only5%had
positive urine or hair assay results.
Because of the high prevalence of co-occurring drug use
and mental health problems, psychiatric symptoms at fol-
low-up were also examined and defined on the basis of hav-
ing 2 or more problems in a mental health checklist: depres-
sion, anxiety, hallucinations, cognitive problems (trouble
understanding,concentrating,orremembering),suicidalide-
ation, or suicide attempt during the year before follow-up.
Finally, criminal involvement was indicated by reports of any
arrests in the year before follow-up.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess
changes over time and analysis of variance was used to
test differences among the PSI groups in follow-up out-
comes. Overall differences among the groups, classified by
PSI score and treatment exposure, were tested by logistic
regression analysis. Within the logistic regressions,
planned contrasts were conducted to compare (1)
patients with low PSI scores who had above-threshold
treatment vs those with below-threshold treatment expo-
sure, (2) all patients with low PSI scores vs other patients
with below-threshold treatment, (3) patients with moder-
ate vs high PSI scores (all above the treatment threshold),
(4) patients with moderate PSI scores with above-
threshold treatment vs patients with moderate-high PSI
scores with below-threshold treatment, and (5) patients
with high PSI scores with above-threshold treatment vs
patients with moderate-high PSI scores with below-
threshold treatment. These analyses were conducted with
SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)32 and used a type I
error rate of 5% (2-tailed test). A Bonferroni adjustment
for the contrast analyses resulted in an adjusted error rate
of 1.2%.

PSI scores at intake were expected to have the most favor-
able5-yearoutcomesregardlessoftheirparticipationinfor-
mal treatment; for patients with higher PSI scores, out-
comes were expected to depend on treatment exposure.
RESULTS
CHANGES OVER TIME
TheomnibustestsfromDATOSintaketofollow-upatyears
1and5showthattherewerehighlysignificantchangesover
time in the outcomes, including cocaine use, heroin use,
alcoholuse,andarrests(Table 2).Posthocanalysescom-
paring intake with year 1 show that large and significant
decreases occurred for each outcome. The differences be-
tweenyear1andyear5werecomparativelysmall,although
the4%increaseforweeklycocaineuseandthe3%increase
for weekly heroin use were statistically significant (differ-
ences for daily alcohol use and arrests were not).
PATIENTS IN TREATMENT AT FOLLOW-UP
One hundred seventeen (almost 17%) patients were in
treatmentatthe5-yearfollow-up.Thesepatientsweremore
likely to have high PSI scores (F1,704
=11.86; P.001; 30%
vs 15%) and were less likely to have met the treatment
thresholdduringDATOS(F1,704
=4.55;P.03;18%vs27%).
Asignificantinteraction(F1,704
=4.74;P.03)indicatedthat
the relationship between below-threshold treatment in
DATOS and being in treatment at the 5-year follow-up was
stronger for patients with higher PSI scores. For ex-
ample, patients with high PSI scores and below-
thresholdtreatmentwereabouttwiceaslikelytobeintreat-
ment at follow-up than those with high PSI scores with
above-threshold treatment in DATOS (39% vs 20%).
PROBLEM SEVERITY INDEX
Because 1-year outcomes were related to PSI scores at in-
take,9 the long-term prediction of this index was reas-
sessed using 5-year outcomes. Comparisons were made
among the patients with low PSI, moderate PSI, and high
PSI scores and the patients in treatment at follow-up. Pa-
tients with high PSI scores were more likely to return to
treatment following DATOS (48% vs 37%, 2

=4.38;
P=.04). Significant differences among the 4 groups were
found for self-reported weekly cocaine use (F3,704
=16.06;
P.001), self-reported weekly heroin use (F3,704
=17.22;
P.001), self-reported daily alcohol use (F3,704

P.001), any arrest [F3,704
=8.26; P.001), and psychiat-
ric symptoms (F3,704
=10.03; P.001). Planned contrasts
found the group with low PSI scores to have generally sig-
nificantly better outcomes than either the group with high
PSI scores or the group currently in treatment.

Noteworthy were the fourth and fifth contrasts, in
which the groups with moderate and high PSI scores, both
with above-threshold treatment, were each compared with
the group with moderate PSI scores with below-threshold
treatment. For the fourth contrast, the group with moder-
ate PSI scores with above-threshold treatment had lower

showed that patients from the high PSI group with above-

caine use at follow-up than the group with moderate-high
PSIscoreswithbelow-thresholdtreatment,includinglower

Overall, the ORs indicate that patients with above-

with below-threshold treatment to have used cocaine; this

COMMENT
This study shows that pretreatment PSI score and level of
treatmentexposurecontinuetoberelatedtooutcomes,even
duringanextended(5-year)follow-upperiod.Thepattern
of outcomes at year 5 was consistent with those reported
at year 1.9 Namely, cocaine-dependent patients with com-
paratively less severe problems at intake generally had the
mostfavorableoutcomes,regardlessoftheirtreatmentex-
posure(Table3).Theyweremorelikelytobeolderandto
have better social functioning (ie, in marriage, education,
employment, and psychiatric comorbidity), less criminal
involvement,andfewerdrugproblems(ie,onalcoholand
heroin use). Thus, long or intensive treatment was not re-
quired (or cost-effective). In contrast, patients who were
in treatment at follow-up had the worst outcomes (except
onurinetestspositiveforcocainemetabolites,whichshowed
more limited recent use of cocaine). These patients typi-
callyhadgreaterbackgroundproblemsandlefttheirDATOS
treatment before reaching threshold tenure.
The remaining 3 groups of patients with moderate-
to high-level problems when admitted to treatment in
DATOS served to test hypotheses concerning the rela-
tionship of outcomes with adequate treatment exposure
for individuals with more severe backgrounds. Patients
whose treatment exposure never reached therapeutic
thresholds had significantly higher cocaine relapse rates
(ie, 46% had cocaine metabolites in their urine and 57%
in their hair--each about 20% higher than for the 2 groups
with above-threshold treatment; Table 3). The group of
patients with high PSI scores and above-threshold treat-
ment showed remarkable improvements on all outcome
measures over time. For instance, their rate of pretreat-
ment weekly heroin use dropped 20% at follow-up (from
27% to 7%), daily alcohol use dropped 35% (from 49%
to 14%), arrests dropped 25% (from 53% to 28%), and
psychiatric symptoms dropped 48% (from 92% to 44%).
These improvements were statistically significant and the
magnitude of their ORs (which were in the 2.0 range)
suggests that they are clinically meaningful as well.
Thesefindingsreiteratetheimportanceofcompliance
withtreatment.Althoughourearlierstudyfoundthatasub-
stantialpercentage(30%)ofthissampledroppedoutoftheir

the rate is comparable with medical disorders such as dia-

Clinical studies have provided evidence for the efficacy of
severalbehavioralinterventionsforcocainedependence,3
butnaturalisticevaluationsoftreatmentexperienceandre-
covery show how patient background, treatment engage-
ment, and outcomes are related. For example, PSI score,
motivation, and readiness are associated with therapeutic
engagement(measuredbothbehaviorallyandcognitively),
and these factors are related to subsequent behavioral and
cognitive improvements during treatment, retention, and
betterposttreatmentoutcomes.28,35-40 Inaddition,previous
treatmentexperiencesofpatients,41 aswellasprogrampoli-
cies, services, and orientation42 can affect therapeutic en-
gagement and outcomes.
Studies of retrospective recall have also demon-
strated their usefulness in long-term (12-year) fol-
low-up studies of patients treated for heroin addiction
by identifying reasons for initiation, relapse, and quit-
ting drug use,43 particularly motivation to quit and the
influence of treatment and family support. Similar data
were collected in the 5-year follow-up interviews re-
ported in this study, and while analyses are still in
progress, preliminary findings are the same as those from
patients addicted to heroin in regard to the importance
attributed to motivation, treatment, and family support.
As McLellan and associates point out,34 there are nu-
merous clinical trials based on 6- to 12-month outcome
evaluations that indicate that addiction treatments are ef-
fective. Clinical trials and naturalistic studies comple-
ment each other. By combining clinical evidence for the
efficacyofbehavioraltreatmentsforcocaineusewithknowl-

edge about factors that help guide decisions by patients to
enter and engage in treatment at therapeutic levels (de-
rived from long-term naturalistic studies), treatment can
be made more effective. By assimilating evidence from ex-
ploratory studies of representative treatment samples,
broader treatment and recovery models can be formu-
lated to address the high attrition and treatment of cocaine-
dependent patients.44
