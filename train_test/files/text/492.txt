Emergency Department Visits for Concussion in
Young Child Athletes
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Two small studies have been
conducted on numbers of sport-related concussions in younger
child athletes (pre­high school).
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first study to characterize a
national sample of emergency department visits for young child
athletes compared with older athletes.
abstract
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to characterize emer-
gency department (ED) visits for pediatric sport-related concussion
(SRC) in pre­high school­ versus high school­aged athletes.
METHODS: A stratified probability sample of US hospitals that provide
emergency services in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance Sys-
tem (1997­2007) and All Injury Program (2001­2005) was used.
Concussion-related ED visits were analyzed for 8- to 13- and 14- to
19-year-old patients. Population data were obtained from the US Cen-
sus Bureau; sport participation data were obtained from National
Sporting Goods Association.
RESULTS: From 2001 to 2005, US children who were aged 8 to 19 years
had an estimated 502 000 ED visits for concussion. The 8- to 13-year-old
group accounted for 35% of these visits. Approximately half of all ED
visits for concussion were SRC. The 8- to 13-year-old group sustained
40% of these, which represents 58% of all concussions in this group.
Approximately 25% of all SRC visits in the 8- to 13-year-old group oc-
curred during organized team sport (OTS). During the study period, 4
in 1000 children aged 8 to 13 years and 6 in 1000 children aged 14 to 19
years had an ED visit for SRC, and 1 in 1000 children aged 8 to 13 years
and 3 in 1000 children aged 14 to 19 years had an ED visit for concus-
sion sustained during OTS. From 1997 to 2007, although participation
had declined, ED visits for concussions in OTS in 8- to 13-year-old chil-
dren had doubled and had increased by 200% in the 14- to 19-year-old
group.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of SRCs in young athletes is noteworthy.

Multiple studies have examined inci-
dence and characteristics of concus-
sion in professional, college, and high
school athletes1­3; however, as 1 arti-
cle stated, "solid concussion data do
not yet exist for prehigh school popu-
lations."4 Numerous concussion ex-
perts have stressed the need for re-
search on the young athlete, especially
with the increasing number of sports
activities available, the increasing
competitiveness of youth sports, and
the increasing intensity of practice
and play times.5 The American Ortho-
pedic Society of Sport Medicine stated,
"What is medically acceptable in adults
may not be safe in teenagers or ado-
lescents. Further studies in the various
age groups and sports will be needed
to answer these clinical problems
safely."6
There is also speculation that concus-
sion in young athletes may produce
more severe long-term developmental
and cognitive problems than are seen
in their older counterparts.4 It has
been noted that less overall head in-
jury force is needed to produce clinical
symptoms in children than in adults.7
Furthermore, experts hypothesize that
brain systems that are responsible for
skill acquisition are more susceptible
to disruption from diffuse injury, such
as is seen in concussion; therefore,
young children who are still develop-
ing their essential skills may be at in-
creased risk for developmental de-
lays.8 Studies have also shown that
younger athletes have prolonged cog-
nitive disturbances (as measured by
neuropsychological testing) after con-
cussion compared with older ath-
letes.9,10 Moreover, there are case re-
ports of the so-called "second impact
syndrome" in which brainstem hernia-
tion occurs after potentially minor re-
injury while a patient is still symptom-
atic from a previous concussion. These
devastating injuries seem to occur
primarily in child and adolescent
athletes.11,12
Management of concussion in the
young athlete has also been the source
of much controversy. There are no
evidence-based management guide-
lines for younger children with con-
cussion, and it has been suggested
that current management strategies
and return-to-play guidelines are too
liberal for young players. For exam-
ple, the 2004 and 2008 International
Conferences on Concussion intro-
duced the idea of cognitive rest, in
addition to physical rest, for athletes
to promote optimal healing.13,14
To elucidate the scope of the problem
of concussion in younger athletes com-
pared with older athletes, our study
characterized emergency department
(ED) visits for pediatric sport-related
concussion (SRC) in pre­high school­
(8­13 years) versus high school­aged
(14­19 years) athletes. These data
could be used to help guide future re-
search and prevention efforts.
METHODS
Study Design
A retrospective review of the National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System
(NEISS) from January 1, 1997, to De-
cember 31, 2007, and the NEISS All In-
jury Program (NEISS-AIP) from Janu-
ary 1, 2001, to December 31, 2005, was
performed. The study protocol was de-
termined to be exempt from institu-
tional review board review by our insti-
tution's Committee on the Protection
of Human Subjects.
Study Setting and Population
The NEISS15 is a data collection system
that is conducted by the US Consumer
Product Safety Commission of a na-
tional probability sample of 100 US
hospitals with a minimum of 6 beds
and a 24-hour ED. It collects data on US
ED visits that are related to consumer
products. The NEISS-AIP is a collabora-
tive effort between the US Consumer
Product Safety Commission and the
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention's National Center for Injury
Prevention and Control. It uses 66 of
100 NEISS hospitals and collects data
on the basis of type of injury. The data-
bases contain data on 350 000 to
500 000 ED visits annually and are in-
tended to provide national incidence
estimates of nonfatal injuries and poi-
sonings that are treated in US hospital
EDs. Information collected by the NEISS
includes date of injury, patient age, di-
agnosis, body part injured, patient dis-
position, locale in which the injury oc-
curred, and type of product or sport
associated with the injury. Incident lo-
cale is coded by NEISS as home, farm
or ranch, street or highway, other pub-
lic property (includes store, office
building, restaurant, church, hotel,
motel, hospital or other medical facil-
ity, nightclub, theater, or other pubic
property), mobile home, industrial
place, school, place of recreation or
sport, or not recorded. In both data-
bases, fatal injuries are excluded, and
no patient outcomes are available. Sev-
eral academic groups have used NEISS
and NEISS-AIP successfully to investi-
gate a wide variety of injury- and
product-related ED visits.16­21
Study Protocol
All ED visits with a diagnosis of concus-
sion were included. Age groups were
divided into pre­high school (8­13
years) and high school (14­19 years).
We then created subsets for all ED
visits for concussion as follows: all
causes, all sport-related, individual
and leisure sport-related, and orga-
nized team sport (OTS)-related. The
all SRC category included team sports,
individual sports (eg, gymnastics,
track), and leisure sports (eg, bicy-
cling, skateboarding). For the pur-
poses of our study, OTS included the
top 5 concussion-generating team
sports (per the collected data) of foot-

ball, basketball, baseball, ice hockey,
and soccer. In an additional attempt to
limit this category to OTS, we re-
stricted location codes to school and
place of recreation or sport. Injury
rates were calculated by using popula-
tion projections from the US Census
Bureau on July 1 of each year. Popula-
tion data were averaged over the
5-year study period. Sport participa-
tion data were from the National Sport-
ing Goods Association (NSGA). The
NSGA conducts annual mail-based sur-
veys of 30 000 preselected US house-
holds, collecting self-reported sports
participation data for US residents. El-
igible participants include household
members who are aged 7 years and
report participation in a sport at least
once during the 12-month period. In-
formation collected includes age,
name of sport, and number of days
participated during the previous 12
months. Because of constraints set
forth by the NSGA, ages were grouped
into 7 to 11 years and 12 to 17 years.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS Survey
Procedures (PROC SURVEYFREQ) to ac-
count for the complex sampling design
and weighting structure associated
with NEISS. Each case was assigned a
sample weight on the basis of the in-
verse probability of selection (pro-
vided by NEISS). These weights were
used to calculate national estimates of
nonfatal injuries. Confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated by using a direct
variance estimation procedure that
accounted for the sample weights.
RESULTS
From 2001 to 2005 (Figs 1 and 2), chil-
dren who were aged 8 to 19 years had
an estimated 502 000 ED visits for con-
cussion. The 8- to 13-year age group
accounted for 35% of these visits.
Approximately half of all ED visits for
concussion in our studied ages were
sport-related. The 8- to 13-year-old chil-
dren sustained 40% of these, which
represents 58% of all concussions in
this younger group. SRCs accounted
for 46% of ED visits for concussion in
the older age group.
More than 95 000 estimated ED visits
for concussion occurred after playing

occurring in the younger group. Ap-
proximately 25% of all SRC visits in 8- to
13-year-old children and 47% of all SRC
visits in 14- to 19-year-old children oc-
curred during OTS.

US children aged 8 to 13 years and 3 in
every 1000 US children aged 14 to 19
years had an ED visit for concussion sus-
tained during 1 of the top 5 OTSs.
Estimated ED Visits for Individual
and Leisure SRCs
In the 8- to 13-year-old group, the ma-
jority of ED visits for individual and lei-
sure SRCs occurred during cycling, fol-
lowed by playground activities, snow
skiing, skateboarding, and horseback
riding (Table 1). For the older age
group, the numbers of visits for skiing-
related concussions was nearly dou-
ble that of the younger group, and in
combative sports (eg, martial arts,
boxing, wrestling, fencing), it was
nearly 4 times as great; for other
sports, it was smaller.
OTS-Related Concussions
In 8- to 13-year-old children, the greatest
number of ED visits for concussion dur-
ing OTS resulted from football, followed
by basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice
hockey (Table 2). A similar order was
observed in the older age group, with
football showing higher and basket-
ball lower overall percentages.
Table 3 summarizes estimated concus-
sion visit rates per participant in each
of the team sports by using participa-
tion data from the NSGA. Because of
participation data constraints set by
the NSGA, the age groups were
changed to 7 to 11 years and 12 to 17

years for Table 3. For the younger
group, during the 5-year study period,
the visit rate for concussion was high-
est for ice hockey, at 10 per 10 000
participating children, followed by
football at 8 per 10 000. Similar dif-
ferences were noted in the older group.
Trends Over Time
Figure 3 depicts estimated ED visits for
concussion and participation data for
the top 5 organized sports for the
years 1997 to 2007. As can be seen
from Fig 3, ED visits for OTS-related
concussions in 8- to 13-year-olds dou-
bled during the period depicted and in-
creased by 200% in the 14- to 19-
year-old group. Overall participation
in these team sports, however, de-
creased by 13% in the same period.
(As with Table 3, the 7- to 17-year age
group was used for participation data
because of the constraints of the NSGA
data.)
DISCUSSION
Our data show that older children
have an overall greater estimated
number of ED visits for SRC com-
pared with younger children; how-
ever, younger children (8­13 years)
represent a considerable portion of
SRCs (40%). The majority of con-
cussions overall and within the
younger group are sport-related
(50% and 58%, respectively). This
is in agreement with previous,
smaller studies that showed similar
numbers.22,23
Similarly, when participation data
are taken into account (Table 3),
SRCs seem even more problematic for
certain sports. The largest number of
ED visits for SRC in OTS in younger ath-
letes was seen in football and basket-
ball, but this seems to be the conse-
quence of the comparatively higher
level of participation in those sports.
When participation rates were ac-
counted for, the rate of concussion
was highest in football and ice hockey.
What is more striking (as depicted in
Fig 3) is that the number of SRCs in OTS
have increased significantly during a
10-year period despite an overall de-
cline in participation. Experts have hy-
pothesized that this may be secondary
to the increasing number of sports ac-
tivities available, increasing competi-

tiveness of youth sports, and increas-
ing intensity of practice and play
times5; however, the increasing num-
bers may also be secondary to in-
creased awareness and reporting.
Our assessment highlights the need
for additional research and injury
prevention strategies into SRC. This
is especially true for the young ath-
lete, with prevailing expert opinion
suggesting that concussion in this
age group can produce more severe
neurologic sequelae, such as pro-
longed cognitive disturbances, dis-
turbed skill acquisition, and second-
impact syndrome.8­12
There are numerous avenues for fu-
ture research into SRC in the young
athlete. First, no comprehensive
return-to-play guidelines have been
adapted for the young athlete, and
the majority of current and past
studies were performed with older
athletes. One potential strategy in-
volves the use of neuropsychological
testing.24­26 This method is being
studied in high school, collegiate, and
professional athletes.27 Other return-
to-play decision techniques being in-
vestigated include functional MRI, vi-
sual tracking technology, and balance
dysfunction tracking.27
Additional work also remains to be
conducted to standardize the man-
agement of SRC in young athletes by
health professionals. No evidence-
based, management guidelines have
been published specifically for this
age group, although most experts
agree that young children cannot be
treated in the same way as older ad-
olescents.22 For example, discussion
at the 3rd International Conference
on Concussion in Sport in 2008 ad-
dressed the suggestion of not only
physical but also cognitive rest and a
slow, graded return to play and
school.14 The need for more conser-
vative treatment of younger children
was stressed, with no same-day re-
turn to play and gradual overall re-
turn to play.
Prevention strategies for younger
athletes also require additional ex-
amination. For example, no state cur-
rently requires the use of helmets
during skiing activities for any age
group; however, several studies have
shown that the use of helmets during
alpine activities can provide protec-
tion against facial and head inju-
ries30­33; consequently, the 3rd Inter-
national Conference on Concussion in
Sport recommended their use for all
alpine sports.14 Soccer is another
sport in which prevention strategies
could be bolstered. Most soccer-
related concussions are not caused by
purposeful heading of the ball but by
collision with another player, goal
post, or ball kicked by another player
into the head from a short distance;
therefore, strategies might include
decreasing the mass and air pressure
of balls used by younger players and
securing and padding goal posts
properly.32
Finally, there are potential benefits
in enhanced education for coaches,
trainers, parents, and the athletes
themselves to increase reporting and
proper management of SRC.32 Studies
have shown that many athletes with
concussions do not seek medical at-
tention or even report symptoms to a
caregiver.33­36 A 2009 study noted that
parents and coaches also have a lack
of understanding of concussion, with a
significant number not familiar with
what a concussion is or when to keep
athletes from returning to play.37 A
similar 2007 study of coaches showed
notable misunderstandings about
concussion.38
Our study has several limitations. First,
the true number of concussions is
likely underestimated by NEISS, be-
cause it does not include concussions
that are treated at urgent care facili-
ties, at doctors' offices, at home, or
by coaches/trainers. Second, concus-
sions overall are underreported by
athletes and caregivers, lowering esti-
mated overall numbers.33,36
We attempted to restrict our analysis
of competitive team sport to only OTS
through 2 methods. First, by restrict-
ing location codes to school and place
of recreation or sport, we attempted to
minimize nonorganized settings. Sec-
ond, by review of the NEISS narrative
descriptions, we were able to exclude
additional records that did not involve
athletic competition or training. De-
spite this approach, some cases may
have been erroneously omitted or
included.
Details of the circumstances and char-
acteristics of the injuries in the NEISS
data sets are limited; therefore, we re-
lied on accurate diagnosis on the part
of the recording facility. Finally, it is
important to note that participation
data from the NSGA may represent an
overestimation because the NSGA de-
fines a participant as someone who
participated "at least once in the last
12 months." This would have caused
our calculations to be an underestima-
tion of the true injury incidence.
CONCLUSIONS
Although the number of SRCs is higher
in the older athlete, the number in
young athletes is noteworthy and war-
rants additional research. The rate of
ED visits for concussion in OTS seems
to be highest in football and ice hockey,
and the most ED visits for concussions
in leisure and individual sports are in
bicycling, playground activities, and
snow skiing. In addition, ED visits for
concussion in both age groups is on
the rise, whereas participation in the
top 5 OTSs is declining. Additional re-
search to provide guidance in manage-
ment, prevention strategies, and edu-
cation for practitioners, coaches, and
athletes is required.
