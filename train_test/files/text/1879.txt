Abstract
Background: The increasing prevalence of obesity is a public health concern and perceived as a potential risk factor in open heart surgery. We
critically appraised the literature available regarding postoperative complications in obese patients. Methods: A single-center retrospective
evaluation of complication rates (1999--2004) in cardiac surgical patients categorized by body mass index (BMI) was conducted. The overall
incidence of complications (CX), renal failure (RF), hemodialysis (HD), atrial fibrillation (AF), cardiac arrest (CA), infections (INF), stroke (CVA and
TIA), prolonged ventilation (VENT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) were observed. Patients with normal BMI (20--30) served for comparison,
obesity and extreme obesity (ExtOb) were defined as BMI 30--40 and !40, respectively. Results: In our institutional review of 1920 patients, 1780
met the inclusion criteria with BMI < 20 (n = 53), 20--30 (n = 1056), 30--40 (n = 592), and !40 (n = 79) based on National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) criteria. Significant increase in complications (STS database guideline definitions) were observed with a BMI ! 40,
58% versus 47% ( p = 0.04). Extremely obese patients (ExtOb) had increased length of stay (LOS) (11.4 days vs 9.6 days; p 0.01), rate of renal
failure (14.3% vs 5%; p 0.01) and prolonged ventilation (39%; p = 0.01) compared to non-obese patients. Extremely obese had no significant
increase in hemodialysis (7.3% vs 3.2%; p = 0.11) or stroke (5.2% vs 2.9%; p = 0.29). Obese patients (Ob) had increased LOS (10 days vs 9.6 days;
p = 0.04) and prolonged ventilation (28.3% vs 23.5%; p = 0.03). Conclusions: Cardiac surgery can be performed without significant increase in
perioperative and 30-day mortality in obese and extremely obese patients. Overall complication rates and LOS in patients with BMI ! 40 is
increased and demands attention. We provide evidence that rates of few specific complications increase with extreme obesity. For risk
stratification in the setting of an obesity epidemic, we advocate an interdisciplinary approach in obese patients undergoing elective cardiac
surgery.

1. Introduction
The prevalence of obesity (Ob) has increased in the United
States and most European countries during the last decade and
is continuing to rise [1,2]. This has also been the experience in
other affluent and developing societies [2]. The International
Obesity Task Force, a non-government organization that
studies the obesity epidemic, estimates one out of every five
people worldwide is overweight or obese. Obesity, defined as a
body mass index (BMI) higher than 30, has increased 8% in the
United States since 1994 to 30% of the population. This was
estimated from the most recent National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) of the Nation Health Centers of
DiseaseControlandPrevention.Ithasalsobeenestimatedthat
age-adjusted extreme obesity (ExtOb), defined as a body mass
index greater than 40, has increased from 2.9% [NHANES III
(1988--1994)] to 4.7% [NHANES continuous (1999--2000)]
during the same time period [1]. The costs of disease
prevention and medical management of obese patients are
of increasing concern for society [1].
Patients undergoing cardiac surgery with excessive body
mass index are likely to have other comorbid factors including
the five obesity-related illnesses: type II diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stroke, and coronary artery
disease [3]. These illnesses account for approximately 85% of
the increased health problems and economic burden of
obesity [3,4]. Long-term follow-up of the original Framingham
cohort revealed that obesity, measured by Metropolitan
Relative Weight, was a significant independent predictor of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) [5]. In addition to CVD, the risk
of ischemic stroke in the obese is twice as high as the normal
population. Obesity has also been positively linked to
myocardial dysfunction in patients even without coronary

artery disease. A direct relationship between diastolic
dysfunction and systolic impairment has been described in
the context of excessive BMI.
There is currently no systematic assessment of the
evidence available regarding extremely obese patients and
their perioperative risks. Specifically, the scarcity of data
regarding the extremely obese patient population in cardiac
surgery, as defined by the NHANES criteria, is addressed. Risk
stratification and informed consent are the primary motiva-
tion to establish patient-associated factors leading to
potentially increased morbidity and mortality.
2. Methods
This is a retrospective analysis of 1920 consecutive
patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of
Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics between January 1, 1999 and
May 28, 2004, excluding cardiac transplantation and
ventricular assist device (VAD) surgeries.
Preoperative data were collected using the Society of
Thoracic Surgery (STS) data criteria; these included: age,
gender, height,weight, date ofsurgery, currentsmoking habit,
diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and pre-
operative creatinine level in serum. The operative information
reviewed included: cross-clamp time, cardio-pulmonary
bypass time, the use of an intraaortic balloon pump, blood
product use, and postoperative ventilation time. Postopera-
tive information included the overall complication incidence
as well as specific adverse events associated with cardiac
surgery, including: deep sternal infection, septicemia, pre-
sence of a transient ischemic attach (TIA) or cerebral vascular
accident (CVA), prolonged ventilation (>24 h), pulmonary
embolism (PE), pneumonia, renal failure (RF) with or without
dialysis, heart block, cardiac arrest (CA), adverse events
related to anticoagulation (DIC and HIT), tamponade,bleeding
requiring reoperation, graft occlusion, valvular dysfunction,
atrial fibrillation (AF), gastrointestinal complications, inf-
ormation related to total ventilation time, and reoperation for
bleeding or non-cardiac reoperations. Furthermore, outcomes
of operative death, 30-day mortality, length of stay (LOS), and
intensive care unit stay (ICU) were analyzed.
Body mass index which serves as an indirect measure of
total body fat, was calculated using the patients height and
weight [BMI = weight (pounds)/height (inches)2 Â 703)] or
[BMI = kg/m2] at the time of surgery in accordance to NHANES
1999--2000 criteria. The patients with a normal or ove-
rweight BMI (20--30) were defined as the non-obese
reference group (NonOb). Obesity was defined as BMI 30--
40 and extreme obesity as a BMI ! 40 [1]. To define the BMI
categories, the range intervals are closed on the left. A
patient with a BMI of !30 but less than 40 is included in the
obese group. Patients whose BMI was lower than 20 (n = 53)
were excluded from the analysis.
2.1. Statistical methods
Continuous variables are presented as mean Æ one
standard deviation. Categorical variables are shown as the
percentage of the sample in a given category. A Kruskal--
Wallis test was used for comparing medians across groups. For
categorical variables, Fisher's exact test was used. For pair-
wise contrasts between groups, the Wilcoxon rank sum was
used for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for
categorical variables. All computed p values are two-sided. In
every instance a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.
There was no adjustment to the significance level for the
number of hypotheses being tested. All computations were
performed in R version 1.9.1 for Windows XP (R Development
Core Team, 2003).
For the graphic representation of BMI complication rate,
the range in BMI (13.14--58.0) was divided into 10 equal-
length intervals, closed on the left, as discussed above. The
plot excludes the two highest intervals ([48.8, 53.9), [53.9,
59]), since their respective frequencies (n = 7 and n = 2) were
deemed to be too low to produce reliable complication
estimates.
The review was selective for publications assessing high
BMI (BMI > 27) in context of complications after cardiac
surgery. We critically appraised the literature available after
systematic searches of the terms: obesity, body mass index,
cardiac surgery, CABG, complication rate, valve surgery,
mortality, and morbidity. We reviewed all literature available
after the following terms searched, but excluded publica-
tions pre-1985 to prevent excessive historical bias. Further-
more, studies that did not provide control group or reviews of
less than 50 obese patients were excluded. Databases
searched for these terms included: Medline, Up to Date,
and University of Wisconsin electronic library systems.
3. Results
The patient and treatment characteristics of the study
population are detailed in Table 1. Obese patients with BMI
30--40 in our study do not demonstrate an overall increased
complication rate (46.8%; p = 0.8). However, this group of
patients had significantly increased prolonged ventilation
times (28.3% vs 23.5%; p = 0.03) and length of stay (10.0 vs
9.6; p = 0.04) as inpatient when compared with the non-
obese reference category (BMI 20--30, see Table 3). No other
adverse events were statistically significant in the obese
group compared with the non-obese patient group after open
heart surgery.
This study found an increase of specific morbidities
following cardiac surgery in the extremely obese patient
group when compared to the non-obese patient population
(58% vs 46%; p = 0.04, see Table 3). Prolonged ventilation,
defined as intubation for longer than 24 h (39% vs 23.5%;
p = <0.01), was more frequently observed in this patient
group. The incidence of renal failure, as defined by a
creatinine in serum rise twice the baseline value and greater
than 2.0 mmol/L, was increased significantly in the extre-
mely obese patient group (14.3% vs 5.0%; p = <0.01). Length
of stay was also increased (11.4 vs 9.6; p < 0.001).
The observed perioperative and 30-day mortality was not
shown to be increased in the obese group (BMI ! 30); nor was
it shown to be elevated in the extremely obese patients
(BMI ! 40) in this retrospective analysis. This corresponds
with previous reports of patients undergoing cardiac surgery
with elevated BMI (see Table 4). However, the BMI ! 40 has
not been previously investigated in this context and presents

a novel evaluation of clinical data. Although the low BMI
group (<20) showed a trend towards increased overall
complication rates, it did not prove to be statistically
significant when compared to the normal BMI index
( p = 0.78).
All other potential cardiac surgical complications eval-
uated showed no important clinical differences between the
BMI categories. This included sepsis, CVA or TIA, pulmonary
embolism, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, or
anticoagulation-related complications. The actual frequency
of complications and its statistical significance is detailed in
Table 2.
In order to provide a graphic estimation of relative risks,
the complication rates observed were plotted against BMI
(Fig. 1). This demonstrates clearly that no increase in overall
morbidity risk for patients with BMI 20--30 exists. For patients
with BMI indices less than 20 and greater than 30, a continual
increase of the complication rate is apparent. A U-shaped
curve representing the frequency of complications and
postoperative adverse events at the extremes of the BMI
range is evident.
4. Discussion
The increasing prevalence of obesity and its associated
medical hazards are a considerable public health concern in
most developed countries. Specifically, body mass indices
greater than 30 are thought to be associated with excess
surgical risks. Both age-adjusted prevalences of obese as well
as extremely obese patients are likely to increase according
to current US Nation Health And Nutrition Examination
Survey [1] and European epidemiological data project
EURALM.
A national health consensus conference on obesity surgery
described an increase in demand for bariatric surgery, with
potential candidates having a BMI ! 40 (representing
approximately 100 lb excess body weight for a male and
80-lb excess for female patients). The Society for Bariatric
Surgery noted an exponential increase of such operations
performed over the last five years [6], with >100,000 of these
major gastrointestinal procedures were performed in 2004 in
the US alone. The operative risks of gastric resections or
bypass procedures are both procedure- and patient-related.
The risk stratification for other major surgical procedures
have not been well defined.
In the era of risk stratification and informed consent,
commonly applied estimation of open heart surgical risks may
not adequately aim to assess obesity as a risk factor in various
scoring systems [7,8]. Additionally, the highly predictive
EuroSCORE does not include BMI stratification for cardiac
surgical risk [9].
There are surprisingly few studies assessing complications
in obese patients undergoing open heart surgery. Most
authors provide retrospective studies with limited insight
into selective adverse events, associated with coronary
artery bypass grafting. Outcomes have not been shown to be
adversely affected in patients below BMI of 40 in these
studies. This study primarily assessed mortality and morbid-
ity associated with BMI ! 40 and provides confirmation of low
mortality in this patient group. Similarly, our evidence shows
that obese patients can have an acceptable perioperative
and 30-day mortality rate. In fact, our outcome data for the
patients defined as extremely obese is similar to the non-
obese patient group. A tertiary medical center with surgical
experience in this patient group provides expertise that
compensates for certain potential complications (Table 2).
Kuduvalli et al. reported an increased frequency of
prolonged ventilation in patients with a BMI > 35 [10]. We
confirmed that prolonged ventilation, based upon the
definition of postoperative intubation greater than 24 h, is
likely in obese and extremely obese patients undergoing

major cardiac surgery. The use of bronchodilators following
cardiac surgery was found to be increased in one prospective
study [10]. The incidence of postoperative pneumonia did not
differ across our BMI categories. Others observed frequent
respiratory impairment during the postoperative phase, but
this has neither been well defined nor established in other
reviews [11]. Obese patients are more likely to have a low
respiratory reserve with a ventilation/perfusion mismatch
and decreased functional residual capacity. This, however,
has not led to adverse outcomes in intensive care medicine in
the obese patient.
Our finding of increased acute renal failure, defined by
creatinine rise two times from baseline and greater than
2.0 mM/ml, has not been previously reported in association
with cardiac surgery in obese patients. However, this was not
associated with a statistically significant increase in patients
requiring renal dialysis for either obese or extremely obese
patients. A previous prospective study did not show an
association between acute renal failure and body mass index
[10].
The previous reported finding that obese patients suffer a
higher incidence of postoperative superficial or deep wound
infections (INF) could not be verified in this retrospective
analysis. The low risk observed in both the obese and
extremely obese patient groups of sternal wound infections,
probably reflect the use of the STS definition applied and the
expertise developed at this tertiary center with high
prevalence of morbid obesity. Gaynes et al. [12] reported
a similar experience. In other studies, the expected
incidence of postoperative mediastinitis has been linked to
obesity but maybe mostly associated with diabetes mellitus
and perioperative hyperglycemia with the presence of other
comorbid conditions prevalent in this patient group [13--15].

Fig. 1. Complication rates in open heart surgery plotted against BMI intervals.
Patients were bundled to the closest BMI in successive intervals of approximate
length five (13, 18.1), (18.1, 23.2), . . . (43.7, 48.8). Error bars represent two
standard errors for each BMI-specific complication rate. Numbers above bars
are the number of observations in the BMI interval; nine patients whose BMI
exceeded 48.8 were excluded (complication rate 0.22 for these nine patients).
The bundled groups are different than the BMI categories analyzed in our study.
Birkmeyer et al. [16] describe the rate of wound infections as
up to three times higher in obese patients after adjustment
of other predictors of this outcome. Moulton et al. [17]
studied patients with a BMI > 30 and found increased
superficial sternotomy wound infections and conduit harvest
site infections. Similarly, a large retrospective study con-
ducted by Engelmann et al. concluded that wound infections
are more frequent in obese patients and observed a high
incidence of deep sternal wound infections. Sternal wound
infections were a major finding in five of the eight series
reviewed. Loop et al. [13] established an odds ratio of 2.9
associated with obesity for sternal wound complications in a
multivariate analysis of 6504 patients. Our population group
did not show increased incision-related superficial or deep
sternotomy wound infections (Table 2).
Findings regarding bleeding complications observed in this
setting are controversial. A prospective cohort described by
Birkmeyer et al. [16] showed decreased postoperative
bleeding in obese patients (BMI > 31). This was not confirmed
by a multivariate analysis of extremely obese patients with
BMI > 36 [16]. Similarly, our obese patient group had a
reduced risk of postoperative bleeding (Table 3). This may
appear counterintuitive on first assessment but little
information regarding bleeding propensity and hemostatic
properties after major surgery in obese patients is available.
Only two studies with small patient cohorts studied
product transfusion rates in obese patients after cardiac
surgery. Uva et al. [18] found an increased transfusion rate
while Ranucci et al. [11] found a decreased transfusion rate.
The indications for transfusions and parameters used for
blood products were poorly defined and no conclusive
evidence is available to date [11,18]. The obese and
extremely obese patients in our cohort did not show
increased hemorrhage tendencies and required no more
frequent blood product transfusions than non-obese cardiac
surgical patients. In fact, a marked decrease for the need in
reoperation for bleeding was observed in both obese patient
groups in our retrospective analysis. Blood product use,
defined as transfusion intraoperatively or postoperatively
according to STS guidelines, was similar across all three
groups and does not explain the decreased reoperation rate
for obese patients.
A higher frequency of postoperative hypertension requir-
ing pharmacological intervention was not observed in our
obese patient group. This association was previously found in
a single prospective study published in 1985 by Koshal et al.
[10] but not confirmed by other authors. The high
preoperative prevalence of hypertension as a co-morbid
factor in this group does not pose a clinically prominent
problem postoperatively. Similarly, diabetes mellitus present
preoperatively in 54.5% of the extremely obese patients and
37.9% of the obese patients has not been shown to result in
clinically relevant postoperative morbidity. Little informa-
tion is available regarding the metabolic syndrome and
glucose metabolism derangements in the obese cardiac
patient in the postoperative phase. Contrary to bariatric
surgery, where significant weight loss, remission of diabetes
mellitus and improvement of lipid serum levels are observed,
cardiac surgery in the extremely obese patient does not
provide therapeutic interventions for these pre-existing
comorbidities [19]. Continued long-term medical manage-
ment is essential in improving life span.
In a relatively small retrospective study, Brandt et al. [20]
have reported no statistically significant complication
increases in obese patients. They report a discrepancy
between total procedure time of CABG and discuss technical
considerations in their obese patient group [20]. Procedural
difficulty or operative hazards encountered in obese patients
cannot be analyzed in this context. As with reoperations, for
example, a certain level of expertise is required to avoid
operative pitfalls as well as postoperative complications. It is
apparent that with relatively minor adjustments intraopera-
tive problems can be avoided.
Methodological differences alone may not conclusively
explain the range of findings of the studies compared in
Table 4. Most evidence provided has been extrapolated from
relatively small prospective and retrospective studies. Two
prospective multi-center studies were conducted adjusting
for confounding factors including preoperative comorbidities
[10,16].
Although a consensus definition for obesity and extreme
obesity exists according to World Health Organization (WHO)
and NHANES, authors have used variable BMI cutoffs to define
their patient groups (Table 4). Other authors have defined
obesity by percentage change from ideal body weight
calculations [5]. The comparability of the studies available
is therefore limited and does not allow for meta-analysis.
The majority of previous studies available have been
conducted with the primary focus on coronary bypass surgery
outcomes. Our patient population consisted of both valve and
coronary surgical patients combined similar to the studies by
Engelman et al. and Moulton et al. [17]. Our decision to
exclude transplant and VAD surgeries is based upon previous
studies demonstrating an increased mortality in obese

transplant recipients. Although patients with cardiac surgery
have similar perioperative complications, we assessed a more
heterogeneous population of patients and therefore possibly
introduced confounding variables. Our reference population
is representative for a large tertiary surgical care center in
the United States. The referral patterns reflect the
demographics of this region and include the largest patient
cohort described of extremely obese patients.
Risk stratification is the ultimate motivation for establish-
ing complication rates in obese patients undergoing cardiac
surgery. Preoperative evaluation of obese patient undergoing
cardiac surgery provides an opportunity for an interdisci-
plinary approach to allow accurate risk stratification and
informed patient choices. The approach for consenting
patients, and the medico legal issues for consenting patients,
has become a focus of daily clinical practice. Our data
provides evidence that cardiac surgery is safe even for the
extremely obese patient population.
Since obesity is a chronic condition, a potential risk
reduction based on weight loss alone has to take into account
the recidivism of weight loss programs. Behavior modifica-
tions, exercise, and diet are considered the mainstay of
treatment for obesity. Few patients are successful in
reducing their weight preoperatively, although some evi-
dence suggests that patients generally have better recovery
and increased mobility with major surgical procedures after
preoperative weight reduction [21,22]. Genetic factors may
be responsible for up to 70% of the variation of patients
weights [23]. It is critical to appreciate that patient's weights
will fluctuate within 10% of a physiological set value and the
regulation of BMI involves maintenance of energy balance as
well as nutrient composition and physiological feedback
mechanisms. Chronic imbalance between energy intake and
energy expenditure seen in a majority of severely obese
patients results in adipose tissue mass increases.
Leptin, a circulating protein of lipid homeostasis, may
provide novel approaches to regulate adipose tissue pro-
liferation and could theoretically reduce body mass indices in
short term prior to cardiac surgery [24]. However, any effect
on perioperative outcomes at present is speculative and this
requires clinical investigation. Given the polygenic nature of
severe obesity, the current constraints of weight loss
programs, and the acute nature of cardiac diseases amenable
to surgical intervention, deferring such procedures in obese
patients may not be justifiable.
The limitations to this study are mostly linked to the
retrospective nature of the analysis and to the lack of the
ability to adjust for confounding variables. BMI was used to
define obesity in this study population. The concept of
normal weight and obesity are relative to the environmental
and cultural factors, with every population presenting as a
continuum of height and weight. WHO criteria for morbid

obesity in the Asian population, for example, differ
compared to the applied NHANES population criteria. The
clinical guidelines employed in this study are applied to the
general population and are not specific to the cardiac surgical
patients. This allows for a selection bias.
The clinical guidelines established by NHANES were
employed in this study. They refer to the general population
and are not specific to the cardiac surgical patients. This
introduces a potential bias. The relatively small denominator
for patients at the extreme end of the BMI spectrum of this
study limits the statistical power and did not yield sufficient
observations for a multivariate analysis of relatively
infrequent complications. The occurrence of deep vein
thrombosis, for example, would require a prospective
assessment, as this is not currently part of the STS
complication data set. A prospective evaluation of obesity
as a risk factor for specific complications in cardiac surgery
would, therefore, require pooled data from multiple centers
in order to provide satisfactory power calculations to detect
increased risk ratios with certainty.
In summary, extreme obesity according to our study and
other data available is not associated with an increased
mortality after cardiac surgery. Extremely obese patients
have a statistically significant increase in frequency of
specific complications, including prolonged ventilation and
acute renal failure not requiring hemodialysis (HD). This may
result in prolonged length of stay and may have economic
health care consequences. Although it has been established
that obese patients are not at an excessive adverse risk while
undergoing CABG [10,11,16,20,25] or cardiac surgery utiliz-
ing cardiopulmonary bypass [17], further clinical investiga-
tion is required focusing on specific cardiac surgical
procedures. To exclude patients from cardiac surgery due
to high body mass index or quote excessive operative risks
may not accurately reflect the evidence currently available.
