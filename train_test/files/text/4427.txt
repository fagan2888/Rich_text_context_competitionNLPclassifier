Abstract
Objective: To assess diabetes self-care behaviours and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in
people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), in China.
Methods: Individuals with T1DM underwent face-to-face interviews over a 7-day questionnaire
period. The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) was used to assess self-care
behaviours. EQ-5D-3L was used to quantify HRQoL.
Results: Of self-care activities, individuals (n ¼ 322) were most likely to adhere to treatment and
least likely to perform foot care. A total of 78.9% of participants did not examine their feet and
33.9% of participants did not monitor blood glucose during the questionnaire period. Moderate/
severe anxiety or depression was reported by 28.6% of participants; 23.9% reported moderate/
severe pain or discomfort. The individual's level of diabetes education, insulin injection regimen and
HbA1c were independently associated with total SDSCA score. Household income and age were
independently associated with EQ-5D index.
Conclusions: Enhancing diabetes education in individuals and implementing strict insulin regimens
could improve self-care behaviours in people with T1DM in China.

the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)
to investigate the coverage, cost and care of
T1DM in China (3C study), found an inci-
dence of 1.1­1.5 cases per 100 000 children
per year.2,3 In addition, the mean glycosy-
lated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level in people
with T1DM in Shantou, China, was found
to be $10%,4 which is higher than the
recommended levels of <7.5% in children/
adolescents and <7% in adults,5,6 possibly
due to a lack of day-to-day diabetes man-
agement. Self-care is important to maintain
optimal glycaemic control and prevent com-
plications,7 including both microvascular
(e.g. retinopathy and neuropathy) and
macrovascular complications (e.g. myocar-
dial infarction, angina pectoris and stroke),
which can negatively affect health-related
quality-of-life (HRQoL)8,9 and have fatal
consequences.10 Self-care requires frequent
monitoring of blood glucose levels (at least
three times per day), monitoring and con-
trolling carbohydrate intake, frequent insu-
lin administration (four injections per day or
infusion via pump), altering insulin dose to
match diet and activity patterns, participat-
ing in moderate-intensity physical activity
for !150 min per week, and checking urine
for ketones when necessary.7
Living with T1DM affects the psycho-
logical and emotional wellbeing of affected
individuals and their families. HRQoL
assesses the individual's perception of
health and is a useful measure of overall
disease burden. It is a multidimensional
concept, comprising physical, emotional
and social components.8 The most import-
ant outcome measure in T1DM may not be
glycaemic control, but perceived HRQoL.11
People with T1DM may have varying
HRQoL burdens at different life stages,
such as loss of Fexibility or overprotection
in childhood, future worries and school
work in adolescence, and work, marriage
and reproduction issues in adulthood. In
addition, diabetes self-care behaviours is
closely associated with metabolic control,12
but it is unclear which behaviours have the
most influence over glycaemic control.
Understanding the factors influencing self-
care behaviours and HRQoL will help
healthcare providers design interventions
to improve the wellbeing of people with
T1DM.13,14
The aim of the present study was to assess
self-care behaviours and HRQoL of indi-
viduals with T1DM who participated in the
3C study at the Shantou Centre.2,3 It was
hypothesized that these people were weak in
some aspects of self-care, that diabetes had a
negative effect on HRQoL, that self-care
behaviours and HRQoL varied between
people at different life stages, and that
some controllable influencing factors could
be identified that could guide clinical
management.
Participants and methods
Study population
The study was designed by the IDF2 and
included primary (four in Beijing, two
in Shantou), secondary (three in Beijing,
two in Shantou), and tertiary (six in Beijing,
two in Shantou) health care facilities with
active diabetes outpatient clinics and the
willingness and capacity to participate in the
study. Study subjects were recruited sequen-
tially from outpatient clinics and inpatient
wards, or by invitation from a list of people
diagnosed with T1DM in a 3-year retro-
spective record review. Participants or their
parent(s) (if <15 years of age) underwent
face-to-face, personal, interviews. People
aged <6 months at T1DM diagnosis were
excluded.
This analysis included people from health
care facilities in Shantou. Trained investiga-
tors performed interviews during July/
September 2011 and January/February
2012; the questionnaire period covered
7 days. Venous blood samples were taken
and tested for HbA1c at local hospital
laboratories using pressurized liquid
148 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)
chromatography. Detailed project design
and implementation information was as
described.2
The study was approved by the Human
Ethics Committee of Shantou University
Medical College, Shantou, China. All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.
SDSCA
Diabetes self-care activities were assessed
using the Chinese version of the Summary of
Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA)
questionnaire, which has been showed to
have high reliability and validity.15 Scores
were calculated for six items: following a
healthy diet; physical activity; adherence to
recommended medications; self-monitoring
of blood glucose; foot care; smoking. Using
a continuous scale ranging between 0 and 7,
the numerical scoring of items was based on
the number of days of the week that the
behaviour was performed; the mean of each
item score was determined to find an overall
score for each self-care activity. Since smok-
ing is uncommon in children and adoles-
cents in China16 this parameter was not
included in the present study.
EQ-5D
Health-related quality-of-life was assessed
using EQ-5D-3L, a standardized scale used
in a wide range of health conditions and
treatments as well as in the general popula-
tion.17 Respondents classify their health
status at three levels of severity (no, moder-
ate, or severe problems) in five dimensions
(mobility; self-care; usual activities; pain/
discomfort; anxiety/depression), resulting in
scores that can be converted into a single
index value for health status (1 ¼ full health;
0 ¼ dead). The index value was assigned
using a Japanese time trade-off value set,18
since no Chinese value set is available.
Participants also completed the EQ-VAS,
which records self-rated health on a visual
analogue scale ranging between 100 (best
imaginable health state) and 0 (worst
imaginable health state).
Statistical analyses
The sample size of the 3C study was
calculated by the IDF, who determined
that a minimum of 320 participants were
required at each study centre (Beijing and
Shantou).2
Data were presented as median (25th, 75th
quartile), mean Æ SD or n (%). Differences
and associations between variables were ana-
lysed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), multiple ANOVA, 2-test or
Spearman's product-moment correlation.
Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's a-
coefficient, and the coefficients of the SDSCA
and EQ-5D questionnaires were 0.72 and
0.77, respectively. Multiple linear regression
analysis was used to identify factors associated
with total SDSCA score and EQ-5D index.
Independent variables included age, sex, dia-
betes duration, household income, residence,
presence/absence of medical insurance,
number of daily insulin injections, HbA1c
level, presence/absence of group diabetes edu-
cation, and presence/absence of individual
diabetes education. The signiEcant variables
were included in a forward stepwise approach.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values< 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included 322 participants (158
male/164 female; median age 23 [16, 33]
years; age range 3­65 years). Demographic
and clinical characteristics of the study
population are shown in Table 1.
Data regarding SDSCA and EQ-5D scores
are shown in Table 2. Of the self-care
activities, participants were most likely to
adhere to treatment and least likely to

perform foot care. During the 7 days included
in the questionnaire period, 254/322 partici-
pants (78.9%) did not examine their feet and
109/322 participants (33.9%) did not monitor
blood glucose. Moderate/severe anxiety or
depression was reported by 92/322 partici-
pants (28.6%) and 77/322 (23.9%) reported
moderate/severe pain or discomfort.
There were no significant between-group
differences in self-care behaviours when
participants were stratified by age (children
aged <13 years [n ¼ 53]; adolescents aged
13­20 years [n ¼ 80]; adults aged >20 years
[n ¼ 189]; Figure 1). When participants were
stratified according to HbA1c, adherence
to self-monitoring of blood glucose was
significantly higher in participants with
HbA1c 7.5% (n ¼ 61) than in those with
HbA1c > 7.5% (n ¼ 261; P < 0.05; Figure 2).
There were no statistically significant
between-group differences in any other
SDSCA parameter.
Self-care data for participants stratified
according to insulin treatment regimen are
shown in Figure 3. Adherence to self-
monitoring of blood glucose was signifi-
cantly higher in participants receiving
!3 daily injections/pump infusion
(n ¼ 209), compared with those receiving
<3 daily injections (n ¼ 113; P < 0.05).
There were no other statistically significant
between-group differences.
Data regarding EQ-5D in people stratified
by age are shown in Figure 4. EQ index was
significantly lower in adults than in both
children and adolescents (P < 0.05 for each
comparison). Children and adolescents had
significantly better HRQoL related to pain
and discomfort than adults (P < 0.01 and
P < 0.05, respectively), and children had sig-
nificantly better HRQoL related to anxiety/
depression compared with both adolescents
and adults (P < 0.05 for each comparison).
Multiple regression analysis found that
individual diabetes education (P ¼ 0.012),
insulin injection regimen (P ¼ 0.001) and
HbA1c (P ¼ 0.034) were independently asso-
ciated with total SDSCA score. Household
income (P ¼ 0.040) and age (P ¼ 0.005) were
independently associated with EQ-5D index.
Discussion
The present study of diabetes self-care
behaviours and HRQoL found that both
foot care and self-monitoring of blood glu-
cose were poor in people with T1DM in
China. In addition, T1DM had an adverse

adults was significantly worse than that of
children and adolescents.
It is known that people with T1DM who
have suboptimal glycaemic control pay
insufficient attention to diabetes self-care
practices.19,20 A majority of participants in
the present study (78.9%) reported having
not examined their feet in the previous 7
days, despite this being the simplest to

perform of the self-care activities. It is
possible that participants may not have
been aware of the need for foot care, due
to the low rate of diabetes education in the
study group (66.5% had received no dia-
betes education). In addition, cost is a
substantial barrier to the use of blood
glucose self-monitoring equipment in
China.3 Few people with diabetes are able
to afford such equipment, and their blood
glucose levels must be monitored in hospital.
Diabetes had a significant impact on
HRQoL. The proportion of participants in
the present study who reported moderate or
severe problems was significantly higher
than in the general population of China.21

This result was consistent with most stu-
dies,8,9,14,22,23 but not all.24 Participants in
the present study commonly reported prob-
lems with pain/discomfort, in accordance
with the findings of others.25­27
Older people with T1DM have been
shown to have poorer self-care behaviours
than children with the condition, especially
after leaving home and becoming focused on
study or work.28­30 There were no significant
differences between age groups in self-care
behaviours in the present study, however,
this is probably due to the small numbers of
children and adolescents in this cohort.
Our finding that adults had significantly
lower EQ-5D index than children and ado-
lescents was consistent with other studies.31
This may be related to the presence of
diabetic complications, since nephropathy
has been shown to reduce HRQoL in people
with T1DM.8 In addition, adults reported
significantly worse anxiety/depression com-
pared with younger people in the present
study. Adults are generally independent in
this society and experience burdens in fac-
tors including work, marriage, pregnancy or
childrearing. Adolescents and adults with
T1DM have been shown to have a higher
rate of depression and lower self-esteem
than children with the condition.6,32
Education is important in the self-care of
people with T1DM.6 It is of interest that
individual diabetes education had a substan-
tial effect on total SDSCA score in the
present study, but group education did not.
It is possible that group education may
generate resistance and could ignore what
is most important to people with T1DM. In
contrast, individualized diabetes education
emphasizes the importance of increasing
patient autonomy and independency,
which help people with T1DM to discover
and develop their inherent capacity to be
responsible for themselves.33 Family behav-
ioural interventions are known to be more
effective than conventional education pro-
grammes in influencing self-care behaviours
in adolescents with T1DM.34
The type of insulin injection regimen also
had a major impact on self-care behaviours
in the present study. People with an insulin
pump or basal-bolus insulin regimen with
four injections per day must self monitor
glucose levels frequently and receive more
diabetes education compared with other
people with T1DM. Studies have indicated

that both individual and group lifestyle
interventions have positive effects on diet
and self-care behaviours in people with
diabetes, with group settings being most
effective.35 Integrating education and other
therapies, such as intensiEed insulin regi-
mens, is an approach that is likely to achieve
the most effective diabetes control.36
Self-care activity score was independently
related to HbA1c level in the present study.
Guidelines emphasize that effective self-care
is an essential component of metabolic
control.6 All self-care behaviours were
equally important, but self-monitoring of
blood glucose was most effective at influen-
cing the individual's HbA1c level in our
study. Frequent and accurate blood glucose
monitoring, and concomitant optimal
adjustment of insulin to carbohydrate
intake and exercise, are required to attain
(and maintain) ideal glycaemic control.37,38
The frequency of self-monitoring is asso-
ciated with improved HbA1c,39,40 but it was
one of the least frequently performed self-
care behaviours in the present study.
Income and age were independent pre-
dictors of HRQoL in the present study. Poor
HRQoL causes suffering, can seriously
interfere with daily diabetes self-manage-
ment, and is associated with poor medical
outcomes and high costs.41 Improvement in
quality of care (determined by care practices
that improve outcomes) will decrease the
overall lifetime cost of diabetes and normal-
ize life expectancy, by decreasing acute and
chronic complications. More importantly,
improving outcomes will improve HRQoL
for both people with T1DM and their
families. In people with T1DM in the
USA, HRQoL was associated with a pri-
mary insurance source of Medicaid or
another government-funded insurance
scheme.42 We suggest that the Chinese gov-
ernment increases medical investment, sub-
sidizes health insurance and reduces medical
care costs as soon as possible, in order to
improve HRQoL in people with T1DM.
This study is limited by the fact that
participants were recruited using conveni-
ence sampling from six hospitals in Shantou,
possibly affecting the generalizability of
results. Further studies should include
larger, more diverse populations.
In conclusion, the majority of people with
T1DM in this region of China exhibit poor
self-care behaviours and HRQoL. Self-care
behaviours could be improved by enhancing
individual diabetes education and imple-
menting strict insulin regimens. Increasing
the frequency of self-monitoring of blood
glucose may improve metabolic control.
