as predictors of survival among elderly Americans

Abstract
Objectives To examine any association between
social, productive, and physical activity and 13 year
survival in older people.
Design Prospective cohort study with annual
mortality follow up. Activity and other measures were
assessed by structured interviews at baseline in the
participants' homes. Proportional hazards models
were used to model survival from time of initial
interview.
Setting City of New Haven, Connecticut, United
States.
Participants 2761 men and women from a random
population sample of 2812 people aged 65 and older.
Main outcome measure Mortality from all causes
during 13 years of follow up.
Results All three types of activity were independently
associated with survival after age, sex, race/ethnicity,
marital status, income, body mass index, smoking,
functional disability, and history of cancer, diabetes,
stroke, and myocardial infarction were controlled for.
Conclusions Social and productive activities that
involve little or no enhancement of fitness lower the
risk of all cause mortality as much as fitness activities
do. This suggests that in addition to increased
cardiopulmonary fitness, activity may confer survival
benefits through psychosocial pathways. Social and
productive activities that require less physical exertion
may complement exercise programmes and may
constitute alternative interventions for frail elderly
people.
Introduction
All developed nations are facing demographic
transitions in which the proportion of the population
over the age of 65 will double in the next few decades.
By the year 2050 the number of Americans age 90 and
above will grow from its present 1 million to 10 million.
Furthermore, life expectancy for this age group has
changed dramatically over the past decades so that
now over a quarter of those over 65 can expect to live
until they are 90. Those who turned 65 in 1994 are
expected to live 17 additional years, which is an
increase of 22% since 1960. While these changes are
well documented, the determinants of survival in this
age group are poorly understood.
Several studies have shown a link between activity
level and survival.1­5 In these studies it has been assumed
that the survival advantage conferred by activity results
from improved cardiopulmonary fitness attributable to
physical activity.6 We suggest that while physical fitness
itself is important and clearly related to health and
survival, the exclusive focus on physical activity obscures
the health benefits that may be associated with other,
non-physical activities and the possibility that activities
may influence health and survival via other pathways
than those influencing cardiopulmonary performance
or musculoskeletal strength. We examined the relation
between survival and three types of activities separately:
social, productive, and fitness. While several previous
studies provide tentative evidence for a link between
social activities and mortality,7 8 no study has examined
the impact of social and productive activities on the risk
of mortality among elderly people independent of
physical activities.
The exact mechanisms through which activity acts
on health and survival are not known, although several
mechanisms have been suggested. Activity has been
found to be associated with more optimal lipid metabo-
lism,9 high density lipoprotein concentrations,10 and glu-
cose metabolism.11 It also seems that inactivity is
associated with a greater likelihood of behavioural risk
factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity,
poor diet, and smoking.12 Whether or not additional
psychosocial mechanisms associated with the affiliated
aspects of activity also contribute to the survival
advantage enjoyed by more active people is not yet
known. Recent evidence suggests that psychosocial
factors may influence some of these physiological
variables, raising questions as to whether the benefits of
activity may operate through a wider range of
mechanisms.13 14 Social activities have been previously
shown to be associated with several risk factors for
cardiovascular mortality including fibrinogen,15 blood
pressure,16 and presence of coronary heart disease.17
This study contributes to a growing body of research in
gerontology that recognises the importance of social
engagement and productive activity as essential features
of successful ageing.18
Methods
Participants
Participants for this study come from the New Haven
site of the established populations for epidemiological
studies of the elderly (EPESE). Data collection began in
1982 and was repeated annually for 13 years. Face to
face interviews were conducted in participants' homes
in 1982, 1985, 1988, and 1994 with annual telephone
interviews conducted in 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989,
and 1990. All data were collected from participants by
trained lay interviewers who were blinded to study
hypotheses.
Sampling
At baseline the cohort comprised 2812 men and
women age 65 years and older living in the community.
All provided informed consent. The baseline response
rate was 82% (1169 men and 1643 women). By using
data from the 1980 United States census the sample
was designed to be similar to the local population with
respect to age, sex, marital status, living arrangements,
and race/ethnicity. Men and those living in housing for
elderly people were oversampled to increase the
sampling efficiency. Sample design variables including

weights and cluster variables were constructed for use
in the analysis to allow for accurate generalisation to
the population, correcting for the impact of the sample
design on variable estimates and their sampling errors.
These weights were also constructed to take differential
rates of non-response into account. All analyses
presented are corrected to take account of this
sampling design. Further details of the sampling
design have been described elsewhere.19
Measures
The outcome measure, death, was assessed by using
several methods including daily review of newspapers
and hospital admissions records and annual recontact
with all study participants or their next of kin and by
using the national death index. We were able to achieve
nearly complete mortality surveillance on all partici-
pants regardless of whether they dropped out of the
study. Vital status could not be confirmed in 27 partici-
pants (1%) who, because they were not found in the
index search, were assumed to be alive at the end of
follow up. The interview schedule was a 75 page struc-
tured interview that took just over an hour to complete.
Variables used in the analyses
Sociodemographics--Items on age (years at 1982
interview), marital status (married versus non-
married), education (years of schooling completed),
and race/ethnicity (white versus other) were included
in the present analysis. Annual family income was cat-
egorised into two dichotomous variables for low
( < $5000 (£7500)) and moderate income ($5000-9999
£7500-14 999)), with high income group ( > $10 000
(£15 000)) serving as the reference group. To retain
subjects who refused to report income (13%) a
separate dichotomous variable was created for missing
values.
Social, productive, and fitness activities--Information
on the extent of engagement in three types of activities,
our primary independent variables, was ascertained
during a structured interview at home in 1982. In the
current study, only baseline assessments of activity
were used. Subjects were asked about the frequency of
performance of 14 common activities (see table 2 for
details) in the past month. Response options were
"often" (code 2), "sometimes" (code 1), "never" (code 0),
"refused," and "don't know." Full or part time
employment was coded 2, and participation in groups
was coded 1. Separate indices were constructed by
summing responses across the three types of activity.
Each index was set to missing if answers to two or more
of the component questions were missing.
Health status measures--These measures included
self reported medical conditions, a functional disability
index, and relative weight. Subjects were asked if a doc-
tor had told them that they had any of seven chronic
health conditions (myocardial infarction, stroke, hyper-
tension, hip fracture, diabetes, liver disease, and cancer
or tumour). Relative weight was assessed by body mass
index and then divided into approximate thirds to
create dichotomous variables for low ( < 23 kg/m2),
middle (23-27 kg/m2), and high ( > 27 kg/m2) body
mass index. As for income a dichotomous variable for
missing values was created to permit inclusion of sub-
jects with missing values (6%). Final analyses were
repeated after exclusion of cases with missing data on
income and body mass index, and the interpretation of
the results did not change. Functional health status was
assessed by three commonly used, self reported meas-
ures of disability: a seven item Katz index of basic
activities of daily living; a three item measure of gross
mobility based on the work by Rosow-Breslau; and a
five item measure of basic strength and range of
motion developed by Nagi.20 This disability infor-
mation was summarised into a Guttman scale of 5
levels (0-4), ranging from no disability in any item of
each measure (0) to disability in at least one item of
each measure (4).20
Data analysis
The analysis consisted of a series of proportional haz-
ard models to estimate the effect of activity on risk of
death. Kaplan-Meier life tables were computed to
verify the proportionality assumption across quarters
of each activity index (not shown). For the main analy-
sis a continuous time model was specified with
duration of survival as the dependent variable, and
each activity subscale was entered as a continuous pre-
dictor variable. Participants who were still alive at the
end of observation were considered censored. Esti-
mates of model variables and their standard errors
were accomplished through construction of a partial
likelihood function. Results are presented in two ways:
first as regression variables, which represent the
gradient effect on the risk of death of a one unit incre-
ment in each activity subscale, and, secondly, hazard
ratios were computed by comparing the scores of those
on or above the 75th centile and on or below the 25th
centile in the baseline distribution of each activity
index. These comparisons do not constitute a separate
test but are presented for heuristic purposes as an indi-
cation of the relative magnitude of each effect. To
account for the complex sampling design all bivariate
and multivariate models were computed with sudaan
software.21
Results
Table 1 summarises levels of the three types of activities
at baseline, and table 2 gives weighted baseline propor-
tions of participants reporting activities within each
group. Activity level was slightly to moderately
correlated with several other covariates included in the
final models, including age, functional disability,
marital status, missing body mass index, and history of
stroke, diabetes, and cancer. The three activity types
were only modestly correlated with each other, with
Spearman (non-parametric) correlation coefficients
ranging from 0.25 (social and fitness) to 0.32 (social
and productive), suggesting that these type measure
relatively independent domains of activity.
Table 3 shows the proportion of participants who
died between their baseline interview and the end of
observation (August 1995) with correction for the
complex sampling design. Of the entire cohort, 62%
died during follow up. There was a clear mortality
gradient across levels of reported activity for each type
of activity. Those in the least active quarter were 34.7%
more likely to die than those in the most active quarter
in productive activity; the figures being 20.3% for social
activity and 18.8% for fitness activity.

Table 4 shows how the proportional hazards mod-
els (unadjusted and adjusted) predict the hazard of
death over the 13 years of follow up. Preliminary mod-
els and previous research were considered when we
selected covariates for this model to control for
possible confounding by variables extraneous to the
activity-mortality relation. Additional factors available
in the dataset that were included in previous models
but were rejected because they showed no impact on
risk of mortality and did not modify the effect of activ-
ity level included education, history of hypertension,
hip fracture, and angina, depression, cognitive func-
tion, and number of chronic conditions. Both the
unadjusted and the fully adjusted results show that
each of the three activity types examined was
significantly associated with longer survival in these
prospective data. Older age, male sex, high body mass
index, longer history of smoking, and history of stroke,
diabetes, myocardial infarction, and functional disabil-
ity were all significantly related to mortality. Several
other variables including income, marital status, and
race or ethnicity did not reach significance but were
retained in the models because of their associations
with both the outcome and with the primary
independent variable of interest.
After we controlled for other factors related to sur-
vival, social activity was significantly associated with
survival. In the adjusted model those who were more
socially active had longer survival compared with those
who were less socially active. Fitness activities were also
significantly associated with mortality in both the
adjusted and unadjusted models. Finally, productive
activities were also found to be protective against the
risk of all cause mortality in both unadjusted and
adjusted models.
Because of concerns about the independence of
the effect of non-physical activities we conducted addi-
tional analyses to examine the extent to which social
and productive activities were protective against
mortality across the highest, middle, and lowest thirds
of fitness activity. The trend toward lowered risk of
mortality was fairly stable (table 5). The effect of
productive activity was weakest among those who were
most active in terms of fitness activities. Because of
fluctuations in the standard error the significance level
of social activities fell below the 0.05 threshold in the
most and least active thirds; as can be seen from the
coefficients, however, the trend toward consistently
lower mortality was evident in each case. Indeed, the
effect of social and productive activity on mortality was
the strongest among the least physically active (as
measured by the hazard ratio)--that is, the most active
quarter enjoyed the strongest survival advantage com-
pared with the least active quarter among those least
physically active. Because of decreased efficiency in the
estimates these values dip below significance. The
direction and strength of the association, however, is
quite consistent.
Discussion
This study reports on the impact of activity on risk of
all cause mortality among elderly people. More active
elderly people were less likely to die than those who
were less active. Social and productive activities were
observed to confer equivalent survival advantages
compared with fitness activities. This observation is
important because it suggests that activities that entail
little or no physical exertion may also be beneficial. A
wider range of mechanisms, both physiological and
psychosocial, may be involved in the association
between activity and mortality than had been
previously thought.
Limitations and strengths
There were several limitations of this study. We asked
about only a limited number of activities. In addition,
our ability to grade the frequency of participation in

each activity was somewhat crude. For that reason, our
measures of activities convey more information about
the number of activities in which people participate
than information about the extent of that participation.
For this reason the survival advantages of a heavy
investment in only one or two activities would not have
been observed. It may have been possible to find more
substantial effects had we been able to assess more fully
the frequency and extent of participation. In addition,
the number of activities assessed was not consistent
across the three types of activity. Questions were asked
only about activities in the previous month, which may
have introduced some measurement error.
Strengths of this study included the use of a cohort
design that involved a representative sample of elderly
people living in the community. Response rates were
high, and complete mortality surveillance was
achieved.
One possible explanation for these findings is that
activity levels measured at baseline were actually meas-
uring health status in ways not otherwise controlled
for. If this were the case, the elimination of those who
died within the first 5 years of follow up would attenu-
ate the relation seen between activity and survival. We
conducted subsequent analyses to check for this possi-
bility and found that the protective effects of social and
productive activity remained consistent and significant
(results available from the authors). The beneficial
impact of fitness activity was reduced in this model and
fell below significance.
Also, despite the fact that the activity types were
weakly correlated, social and productive activities may
be acting as proxy measures of physical activity. To test
this hypothesis we ran an additional model in which all
three types of activity were entered simultaneously. In
that model (which contained the same covariates as
before) social activities (hazard ratio 0.88; P = 0.024)
and productive activities (0.81; P < 0.001) remained
significant independent predictors of survival and
fitness activities (0.92; P = 0.194) fell below significance.
This may be due to the fact that fewer questions were
asked about fitness activities. None the less, these
results add to our confidence that social and
productive activities exert an independent protective
effect not due exclusively to the impact of physical
activity.
Another potential criticism is that several of our
indicators of productive activity may make a substantial
contribution to an individual's overall level of
cardiovascular fitness. To check for this possibility we
ran similar models in which shopping and gardening
were dropped from the productive activity index. The
results indicated that the beneficial impact of
productive activity remains significant (0.92; P = 0.003).
Further analyses revealed that no single activity was
driving the association of activity types and mortality.
In unadjusted analyses all the individual activities with
the exception of the rarest (paid community work) was
associated with a lower risk of mortality.
Beyond physical activity
Previous studies of activity and mortality have assumed
that physiological pathways mediate this association.
This has led to substantial investment in exercise inter-
ventions in older people. The activities in which older
people engage, however, result in a complex array of
effects beyond improved fitness. Social activities may
involve a broad range of goals, including leisure and
enjoyment, reinforcement of social status and sense of
worth, social engagement, and productivity. It is worth
noting that the initial studies that showed the benefits
of activity were not based on laboratory experiments of
exercise but rather on observational studies of activity
embedded within a social context.7 22

Psychosocial pathways may be involved in the
health benefits of activity. Recent research has shown
that social contacts influence several biological factors.
Substantial evidence indicates that social contacts may
reduce the deleterious effects of psychological stress
through enhancement of both cellular and humoral
immune response.23 Secondly, social and productive
activity involves the performance of meaningful social
roles. These roles may have important consequences
that go beyond the benefits of fitness alone. Meaningful
social role performance promotes a sense of self
efficacy that has been linked to several important
health outcomes in later life.24 25 Social and productive
activity may result in a sense of meaning and purpose
in life, which has been linked to survival in at least one
study.26 Finally, social and productive activity reinforces
relationships as well as norms of reciprocity and mutu-
ality. Social and productive activity may enhance social
networks and social support, which have been linked to
survival in several prospective studies.7 27­28
Our findings corroborate those of a small number
of studies that have found a link between survival and
social activities that entail little or no physical
exertion.29 This finding has important implications for
public policy and clinical practice. Clinicians might
recommend a broader range of activity options for
older people. For patients with chronic conditions such
as arthritis social activity may promote wellbeing more
effectively than physical activity.30 Evidence from the
national health and nutrition examination survey and
other population studies suggests that the prevalence
of inactivity is considerable among adults in the United
States and that it increases substantially among those
aged 65 and older.31 Public policy measures that reduce
barriers to continued social engagement would be
important interventions--for example, public invest-
ment in transport and day centres for elderly people.
Among people in institutions these results suggest the
importance of alternative programmes of activity as a
complement to exercise programmes. Several trials of
interventions in occupational therapy have shown the
feasibility of increasing levels of leisure and social
activity.32
Summary
In summary, these findings build on a substantial body
of studies that show the benefits of remaining active in
later life. Furthermore, an exclusive emphasis on exer-
cise and fitness activity may be overly narrow. While it is
recognised that all social activity has the potential to
include physical activity, as has been argued by Yates,33
it is important that clinicians and policymakers recog-
nise that the physical actions in which humans engage
are inherently social in nature as well. Clinicians can
add powerful new intervention tools by recognising
the health benefits of social and productive activities as
complements to exercise. On their own, social and
productive activities may have independent health
benefits as well.

Key messages
+ Little is known about predictors of survival
among elderly people
+ Physical activity is clearly good for health, but
the potential benefits of social activities have
not been studied
+ Social and productive activities are as effective
as fitness activities in lowering the risk of death
+ Enhanced social activities may help to increase
the quality and length of life

Perinatal mortality and morbidity among babies delivered
in water: surveillance study and postal survey
Ruth E Gilbert, Pat A Tookey
Abstract
Aim To compare perinatal morbidity and mortality
for babies delivered in water with rates for babies
delivered conventionally (not in water).
Design Surveillance study (of all consultant
paediatricians) and postal survey (of all NHS
maternity units).
Setting British Isles (surveillance study); England and
Wales (postal survey).
Subjects Babies born in the British Isles between
April 1994 and March 1996 who died perinatally or
were admitted for special care within 48 hours of
birth after delivery in water or after labour in water
followed by conventional delivery (surveillance study);
babies delivered in water in England and Wales in the
same period (postal survey).
Main outcome measures Number of deliveries in
water in the British Isles that resulted in perinatal
death or in admission to special care within 48 hours
of birth; and proportions (of such deliveries) of all
water births in England and Wales.
Results 4032 deliveries (0.6% of all deliveries) in
England and Wales occurred in water. Perinatal
mortality was 1.2/1000 (95% confidence interval 0.4
to 2.9) live births; 8.4/1000 (5.8 to 11.8) live births
were admitted for special care. No deaths were
directly attributable to delivery in water, but 2
admissions were for water aspiration. UK reports of
mortality and special care admission rates for babies
of women considered to be at low risk of complications
during delivery who delivered conventionally ranged
from 0.8/1000 (0.2 to 4.2) to 4.6/1000 (0.1 to 25) live
births and from 9.2 (1.1 to 33) to 64/1000 (58 to 70)
live births respectively. Compared with regional data
for low risk, spontaneous, normal vaginal deliveries at
term, the relative risk for perinatal mortality associated
with delivery in water was 0.9 (99% confidence interval
0.2 to 3.6).
Conclusions Perinatal mortality is not substantially
higher among babies delivered in water than among
those born to low risk women who delivered
conventionally. The data are compatible with a small
increase or decrease in perinatal mortality for babies
delivered in water.
Introduction
In the 1980s few clinicians offered delivery in water.1 2
By 1993 all maternity units in England and Wales had
managed labour or delivery in water and nearly half
had installed birthing pools.3 Perceived advantages
include women feeling relaxed4 and more autonomous
than in conventional deliveries5--although a review of
three randomised controlled trials4 6 7 of labour in
water showed no clear beneficial or adverse effects on
mother or baby.8
The main advantage claimed for delivery in water
is a gentler experience for the baby. Reports of possible
adverse effects--hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy9
and one death attributed to labour taking place in
warm water10 and infection due to delivery in
water11­13--raise theoretical causal links. Only one
report of a baby who died with waterlogged lungs14 is
clearly attributable to delivery in water. No studies,
however, have yet compared maternal or paediatric
outcomes in similar groups of women delivering in
water and delivering conventionally (not in water).
We conducted national surveys of maternity units
and paediatricians to determine the risks of death or
admission for special care for babies delivered in water
and identified clinical findings that might relate to the
use of water. We compared these results with rates for
women at low risk of complications during labour or
delivery who delivered conventionally.
Methods
From April 1994 to April 1996 (25 months) all 1500
consultant paediatricians in the British Isles were
surveyed each month by the British Paediatric Surveil-
lance Unit15 and asked to report whether or not they
