Alcohol and Hepatitis C Mortality Among Males and
Females in the United States: A Life Table Analysis
Chiung M. Chen, Young-Hee Yoon, Hsiao-ye Yi, and Diane L. Lucas
Objective: Evidence from previous studies suggests that heavy alcohol use (HAU) exacerbates the
rate of fibrosis progression in the liver and results in increased probability for premature death among
patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The current study uses population-based mortality
data to investigate whether heavy drinking affects the age of death among individuals with HCV and,
if so, whether this effect differs between men and women.
Methods: A total of 7,263,163 death records in the United States between 2000 and 2002 were
drawn from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) public-use data files compiled by the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics (NCHS). International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
codes were used to identify the presence of HCV (B17.1 and B18.2) and HAU (as indicated by
alcohol-induced medical conditions, F10 and K70) either as the underlying cause or as one of the
contributing causes of death. The deaths were divided into 4 distinctive cause-of-death categories:
HCV without HAU, HAU without HCV, HCV plus HAU, and all others. The mean ages of death
and the cumulative probabilities of death derived from multiple-cause life table were compared across
these categories.
Results: Hepatitis C virus deaths showed an excessive prevalence of HAU when compared with
non-HCV deaths. Compared with deaths of HCV without HAU, the mean age of death was short-
ened for deaths of HCV plus HAU (from 55.1 to 50.0 years among males, and from 61.0 to 49.1 years
among females). The cumulative probability of death before age 65 was much higher for the latter
than the former group (0.91 vs 0.68 among males, and 0.88 vs 0.47 among females). While HCV alone
showed a disproportionate effect on premature death in males, HAU presented a stronger effect in
females, resulting in a ``catching-up'' effect that diminished the gender difference in age of HCV
death.
Conclusions: This study provides mortality-based evidence to further establish heavy alcohol
consumption as one of the key risk factors contributing to premature deaths from HCV in the United
States. More importantly, this study, for the first time, presents empirical evidence that alcohol con-
sumption affects men and women differently in HCV mortality.

HEPATITIS C IS AN infectious liver disease caused
by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), an RNA virus trans-
mitted by infected blood (Alter et al., 1999). It is estimated
that about 4 to 5 million people in the United States have
been infected with HCV (Alter et al., 1999; Armstrong
et al., 2006; Edlin et al., 2005), and between 10,000
and 12,000 people die annually due to HCV (National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,
2003). After a steady increase in the estimated incidence of
acute HCV from the 1960s through the 1980s, the rate has
decreased since the early 1990s (Armstrong et al., 2000).
However, due to the slow progression of the disease,
prevalence and mortality rates have not declined. Vong
and Bell (2004) reported that deaths from HCV-
related chronic liver disease increased 220% from 1993
through 1998. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) (1998) predicted that HCV-related
mortality could increase by 200 to 300% over the next 10
to 20 years. Owing to its high prevalence and rapidly grow-
ing death rates, HCV is considered a major public health
crisis (Satcher, 1998).
Studies on the natural history of HCV infection show
that acute infection generally leads to chronic infection in
the majority of people (Lieber, 2001; Seeff, 2002). In addi-
tion, about 3 to 20% of patients chronically infected with
HCV will develop cirrhosis over a 20 to 30-year period
(CDC, 1998), culminating in hepatocellular carcinoma

(HCC). Separate literatures have examined the effects of
alcohol consumption on the progression and outcomes
of HCV infection, of gender on HCV outcomes, and of
gender on the consequences of alcohol use. However,
research on whether alcohol consumption affects men and
women differently in the progression of HCV disease is
limited (Peters and Terrault, 2002; Schiff and Ozden, 2003).
Evidence from numerous clinical studies suggests that,
among other risk factors, heavy alcohol use (HAU) exac-
erbates the rate of fibrosis progression in the liver--a
precursor to cirrhosis--and results in worsened outcomes
of cirrhosis and HCC among HCV-infected patients
(Bellentani et al., 1999; Bhattacharya and Shuhart, 2003;
Corrao and Arico, 1998; Donato et al., 2002; Freeman
et al., 2001, 2003; Harris et al., 2001; Khan et al., 2000;
Loguercio et al., 2000; Ostapowicz et al., 1998; Poynard
et al., 1997; Roudot-Thoraval et al., 1997; Serfaty et al.,
1997; Thomas et al., 2000; Wiley et al., 1998). Mortality in
patients with HCV is also affected by excessive alcohol
consumption (Niederau et al., 1998; Yee et al., 2000).
Using hospital discharge data, Kim et al. (2001) found
that the combination of HCV infection and alcohol abuse
increased the probability for premature death.
In the HCV literature, virological evidence indicates that
men are less likely to clear acute HCV infection than
women (Yamakawa et al., 1996). Epidemiological studies
also show that the rate of disease progression for HCV is
more rapid among men than among women (Poynard
et al., 1997, 2001; Salomon et al., 2002; Tong et al., 1995).
Furthermore, mortality from HCV-related chronic liver
disease is higher in men than in women (Vong and Bell,
2004).
The alcohol literature has shown that women are more
sensitive to the adverse effects of alcohol. In a 12-year
longitudinal study of more than 13,000 individuals in
Denmark, Becker et al. (1996) found that women had a
significantly higher relative risk of developing alcoholic
liver diseases than men for any given level of alcohol
intake. The population-based Dionysos study in Italy
found that the risk for cirrhosis was twice as high in
women as in men with the same amount of alcohol intake
(Bellentani et al., 1997, 1999). Several earlier studies also
found that the incidence rate of alcohol-induced liver inju-
ry is higher and the progression of the condition is faster
among women than among men with a similar history of
alcohol abuse (Morgan and Sherlock, 1977; Nakamura
et al., 1979).
Based on findings from these different literatures, it is
reasonable to postulate that the effect of heavy drinking
on premature death from HCV differs among men and
women in the general population. Conceivably, heavy
drinking may have a stronger effect on HCV disease pro-
gression among women than among men, as women are
generally more susceptible to the adverse effects of alco-
hol. The current study uses population-based mortality
data and a life table method to analyze the age pattern of
HCV deaths and to investigate whether heavy drinking
affects the age of death among individuals with HCV and,
if so, whether this effect differs between men and women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
Mortality data were taken from the Multiple Cause of Death
(MCD) public-use data file for 2000 to 2002 compiled by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The MCD includes
individual records from all resident death certificates filed each year
in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data for a 3-year period
were used to increase the reliability of the analysis results.
Causes of death for 2000 to 2002 were coded according to the
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10).
Each death record in the MCD includes codes for 1 underlying cause
of death and up to 20 contributing causes. For the current study,
HCV deaths were identified by either the underlying cause or a men-
tion in the contributing causes. A total of 7,263,163 deaths between
2000 and 2002 were included in this study. Among them, 29,569
(0.4%) had acute or chronic HCV coded as the underlying cause or
one of the contributing causes of death.
The 2000 to 2002 mid-year population data used to calculate mor-
tality rates and life table parameters were taken from releases by the
U.S. Census Bureau (2004).
Research Design
Because no information on drinking behaviors is provided on
death certificates, medical conditions mentioned on the death certifi-
cates that are certainly alcohol-induced served as a proxy measure
for HAU. These included alcoholic cirrhosis and mental/behavioral
disorders due to use of alcohol. Because these medical conditions are
100% attributable to alcohol use, the proxy measure has a high sen-
sitivity in identifying heavy drinkers, although it is a conservative
measure as not all heavy drinkers develop those alcohol-induced
medical conditions (AIMC). Depending on the presence of HCV and
HAU (as indicated by AIMC), irrespective of whether they were
coded as underlying or contributing causes,1 the death records
were classified into the following 4 cause-of-death categories:
(1) HCV without HAU: N 5 24,011;
(2) HAU without HCV: N 5 102,899;
(3) HCV plus HAU: N 5 5,558; and
(4) all others: N 5 7,130,695.
Table 1 presents the ICD-10 codes for HCV and AIMC. Compar-
ing these cause-of-death categories allows us to assess the net effect
of HAU beyond the effect of HCV, as well as the net effect of HCV
beyond that attributable to HAU. For instance, we can evaluate the
net effect of HAU on HCV mortality by comparing the age distribu-
tion among deaths in Category 3 (HCV plus HAU) with that in
Category 1 (HCV without HAU). Similarly, we can evaluate the
effect of HCV on alcohol-induced mortality by comparing Category
3 and Category 2 (HAU without HCV). Category 4 (all others) rep-
resents mortality from all other causes and serves as a baseline for
assessing premature deaths. We can evaluate the combined effect of
HCV and HAU by comparing Categories 3 and 4.
1Preliminary analyses showed very similar age patterns between deaths
with HCV coded as the underlying cause and deaths with HCV coded as a
contributing cause.

Analysis Procedures
Multiple-cause life table analysis (Selvin, 1996) was conducted
to reveal the age patterns of different cause-of-death groups. This
procedure builds on single-cause life table analysis, and is aimed at
isolating the effect of specific causes. A single-cause life table pro-
duces survival probabilities and cumulative probabilities of death
(CPD) by age based on a set of age-specific death rates from all
causes, whereas a multiple-cause life table generates conditional
survival probabilities and CPD, which are cause-specific for sub-
population groups with the respective conditions.
The construction of a multiple-cause life table can be considered
as an extension of a single-cause life table, which can be succinctly
summarized as follows: from the length of the age interval dx
and
the age-specific mortality rate Rx
, derive qx
Â¼ dx
Rx
=1 Ã¾ 0:5dx
Rx
, the
probability of dying in each age interval [x,x1dx
] for those alive at x.
Secondly, apply qx
to an arbitrary number of individuals lx
to pro-
duce the number of deaths dx
5 lx
qx
in the age interval. Finally,
divide the sum of deaths dx
from age x and up by the sum of deaths
dx
from age 0 and up to obtain Sx
(the probability of surviving age x)
and Fx
5 1 Ã S (the probability of deaths before age x). Extending
this procedure with cause-specific qx
and dx
results in a multiple-
cause life table.
We used the lifetabl command (Ramalheira, 2001) in the statistical
software package Stata (Stata Corp., College Station, TX) to con-
struct the multiple-cause life table. For the convenience of reporting,
the CPD (Fx
) were presented by 5-year age intervals (based on an
abridged life table) in tabular form, and by single-year intervals
(based on a complete life table) in graphs. All analyses were carried
out separately for males and females.
RESULTS
HAU Involvement in HCV Deaths
As shown in Table 2, over the 3 years from 2000 to 2002,
the annual average number of HCV deaths was 6,670 in
males and 3,187 in females. These numbers can be trans-
lated to an annual rate of 47.6 and 21.9 deaths per million
population in males and females, respectively. Using
AIMC as a proxy for HAU, the HCV deaths showed an
excessive prevalence of HAU when compared with non-
HCV deaths. Among HCV deaths, 22.3% (1,486) of males
and 11.5% (367) of females were in the category of ``HCV
plus HAU.'' In contrast, of the non-HCV deaths, only
2.2% in males and 0.6% in females had AIMC.
Effect of HAU on HCV Mortality
Figure 1 presents the CPD from the life table analysis for
the 4 cause-of-death categories. The curves showed little
differences before age 40 among these categories. After age
40, there was an increasing divergence in the CPD, with the
fastest increase of deaths in the ``HCV plus HAU'' cat-
egory. The curves of the CPD presented a clear ordering
for females, with ``HCV plus HAU'' being the highest, fol-
lowed by ``HAU without HCV,'' ``HCV without HAU,''
and ``all others.'' Among males, between the same highest
and lowest categories, the CPD curves for ``HAU without
HCV'' and ``HCV without HAU'' were very similar.
Nevertheless, it is clear that, among both sexes, the com-
bination of HCV and heavy drinking (as indicated by
AIMC) resulted in dying at younger ages.
These patterns are also presented in Table 3. The cumu-
lative probability of ``HCV plus HAU'' increases rapidly
from 0.05 before age 40 to 0.91 before age 65 among males

and from 0.10 before age 40 to 0.88 before age 65 among
females. In contrast, the increase is slower for the ``HCV
without HAU'' category: from 0.04 before age 40 to 0.68
before age 65 among males and from 0.03 before age 40 to
0.47 before age 65 among females.
The effect of HAU was also evidenced in the mean age at
death. The mean age of death for ``HCV plus HAU'' was
50.0 and 49.1 in males and females, respectively, which
was about 5 and 12 years younger than that for ``HCV
without HAU'' (55.1 and 61.0), respectively.
Gender Difference in the Effect of HAU
As shown in Fig. 2, the cumulative probability of death
revealed the differential effect of heavy drinking (as indi-
cated by AIMC) on HCV mortality between males and
females. Although little gender difference was observed
before age 40, the CPD increased more slowly for females
than for males in the ``HCV without HAU'' category. This
pattern confirms findings from the clinical literature that
HCV has a disproportionate effect in males. However,
heavy drinking reduced these gender differences, as shown
in the graph for ``HCV plus HAU.'' In that graph, the
CPD curves not only increased much faster but also were
almost identical for both sexes, indicating a ``catching-up''
effect for females that resulted from a stronger impact of
HAU on female HCV deaths than on male HCV deaths.
As mentioned earlier, the male mean age of HCV death
was reduced by 5 years (from 55.1 to 50) in the category
with HAU, whereas the reduction was about 12 years
(from 61 to 49.1) among females. A similar pattern was
found when comparing the CPD of the ``HAU without
HCV'' category with that of the ``all others'' category. In
the ``all others'' category, the CPD was higher in males
than in females. By contrast, males and females had nearly
identical CPDs in the ``HAU without HCV'' category,

suggesting that the effect of HAU was stronger on female
non-HCV deaths as well. It was worth noting, however,
that the gender difference in the reduction of mean age of
death was smaller for non-HCV than for HCV deaths.
DISCUSSION
Using multiple-cause life table analysis, the current study
attempted to examine the effect of HAU, as represented by
AIMC, on the age patterns of HCV mortality. The find-
ings from this study showed that the prevalence of HAU,
as indicated by the presence of AIMC, was relatively
high among HCV deaths. More importantly, HAU had
an undue effect on HCV mortality in shortened life in both
males and females. This pattern is consistent with evidence
from recent clinical and laboratory studies on HCV dis-
ease progression. For instance, it was recently found in
HCV core-transgenic mice that chronic ethanol consump-
tion and HCV core protein additively increased lipid
peroxidation and acted synergistically to increase the
hepatic expression of transforming growth factor-b
(TGF-b) (Perlemuter et al., 2003) and to activate some
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (Tsutsumi
et al., 2003). These may in turn contribute to fibrogenesis
and the pathogenesis of liver disease.
Alcohol consumption at high levels is immunosuppres-
sive and increases oxidative stress. Furthermore, alcohol
potentiates HCV replicon expression, decreases viral clear-
ance, and compromises interferon-a therapy. Both alcohol
and HCV activate hepatic stellate cells, the main source of
collagen within the liver. These in vitro and in vivo data
support several biologically plausible explanations for the
observations reported here and suggest possible appro-
aches that may reveal the mechanisms underlying the
increased rate of liver fibrosis progression in heavy drink-
ers (Bhattacharya and Shuhart, 2003; Gao, 2002; Jamal
and Morgan, 2003; Lieber, 2001; Morgan et al., 2003;
Okazaki et al., 1994; Safdar and Schiff, 2004; Schiff and
Ozden, 2003; Vento and Cainelli, 2002; Zhang et al., 2003).
The current study also examined the gender difference in
the effect of alcohol on HCV deaths. Confirming our
hypothesis, the findings revealed that HAU affected
females more strongly than males, resulting in a much
greater reduction in the mean age of female HCV deaths
than that of male HCV deaths. The presence of an inter-
action effect of gender observed in the current study may
be partially due to more detrimental effects of alcohol on
progression of liver injury among women than among men
with a similar level of alcohol use (Becker et al., 1996). A
review of the literature by Colantoni et al. (2003) summar-
ized several reasons why females are at a higher risk for
alcoholic liver diseases: differences in ethanol pharmaco-
kinetics, alcohol elimination rate, production of free
oxygen radicals, levels of endotoxin in the blood, and
Kupffer cell function. Additionally, Colantoni et al.
(2002, 2003) identified the hepatic estrogen receptor exp-
ression and 2 additional factors--tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)--involved in hepatic
apoptosis and proliferation that might explain the sex dif-
ferences found in rats.
Most existing studies on HCV progression have relied
on clinical samples. Because of the asymptomatic nature of
HCV infection and the long duration of progression, studies
that attempt to characterize the long-term consequences
of HCV infection have certain inherent limitations. Retro-
spective studies are often based on patients in more critical
condition (Degos et al., 2000; Gordon et al., 1993; Niede-
rau et al., 1998; Roudot-Thoraval et al., 1997; Serfaty
et al., 1997; Tong et al., 1995; Tremolada et al., 1992; Yano
et al., 1993), and therefore usually find that the infection of
HCV leads to end-stage liver disease in a relatively short
time. Prospective studies are usually too short (o20 years)
to follow patients from infection to death. The deaths
or the lack thereof during the follow-up has led some
researchers to suspect that the observed differences in rate
of progression among HCV patients may be due to the
competing mortality risks from other causes of death (Kim
et al., 2004).
In most prospective studies, the duration of follow-up is
insufficient to provide complete outcome data on the pro-
gression of the HCV disease because it is not feasible to
conduct large-scale prospective studies that follow patients
from infection to death (Seeff, 2002). The current study
draws strength from mortality data with all death records
in the United States. The large number of death certificates
provided a study sample that is unparalleled in other epi-

ALCOHOL AND HEPATITIS C MORTALITY
demiologic studies. More importantly, they provided an
alternative source of information with which to examine
the consequences of heavy drinking on HCV disease pro-
gression as reflected in the age of death.
As with other observational studies, our inferences are
subject to measurement bias and confounding. The under-
diagnosis of HCV-infection is well established in the
literature, as a large proportion of the infected population
has no symptoms (Seeff, 2002). It is possible that the non-
HAU group had a less chance of being diagnosed with
HCV than did the HAU group due to less exposure to
previous medical presentations, liver function tests, or
development of cirrhosis. Nonetheless, this underdiagno-
sis may not bias mortality studies as much as morbidity
studies because decedents in the non-HAU group have
increased chances of being diagnosed with HCV once they
have developed symptoms of severe end-stage liver disease.
Therefore, the underdiagnosis problem is not likely to
obliterate the large differences in the proportion with
HAU between the HCV and non-HCV deaths in our
results, as they are also consistent with previous studies
(Harris et al., 2002; Yoon et al., 2004).
Because death certificates lack information on treatment
experiences, the effect of selectivity from interferon treat-
ment and liver transplantation cannot be assessed in our
study. Because HAU lowers the efficacy of antiviral ther-
apies (Loguercio et al., 2000; Tabone et al., 2002), heavy
alcohol users are often excluded from interferon-based
therapy. Liver transplantation for patients who have
alcoholic liver diseases is highly selective, with many psy-
chosocial criteria including abstinence from alcohol
(McCallum and Masterton, 2006). These types of treat-
ment selectivity may have contributed to the shorter
survival of the HCV deaths observed in the HAU group
than in the non-HAU group.
There are several limitations in this study. First, due to
the lack of information on the onset of the HCV infection,
the analysis assumed that the age of HCV infection was
similarly distributed between the ``HCV plus HAU'' and
``HCV without HAU'' categories. Under this assumption,
the mean age at death was used to reflect the duration of
disease progression of the 2 categories. If the onset of HCV
infection was at younger ages among heavy drinkers than
nonheavy drinkers, the observed alcohol effect for the
``HCV plus HAU'' category may be overestimated. Sec-
ond, because drinking history is not provided in death
certificates, it is impossible to establish the doseÂ­response
relationship between level of alcohol consumption and
premature HCV deaths. The AIMC coded on death cer-
tificates reflect heavy, problematic drinking. Therefore,
this study was not able to assess the effect of light and
moderate alcohol consumption. Third, using AIMC as a
proxy for heavy drinking may underidentify heavy drink-
ers because not all heavy drinkers develop these medical
conditions, and AIMC are generally under-reported on
death certificates (Hanzlick, 1988; Pollock et al., 1987).
Finally, as Jamal and Morgan (2003) noted, studying the
effects of alcohol and HCV on liver disease is complicated.
Because there is no information on the temporal sequenc-
ing of the onset of AIMC and HCV infection in the
mortality data, it is almost impossible to separate
the effects of alcohol on HCV liver disease from the effects
of HCV on alcoholic liver disease. Despite these limita-
tions, the mortality data do confirm the significant impact
of HCV and alcohol and their detrimental synergism.
In conclusion, this study is a new approach that is useful
because it complements other approaches. The findings
reported here provide mortality-based evidence to further
establish heavy alcohol consumption as one of the key risk
factors contributing to premature deaths from HCV in the
United States. More importantly, this study, for the first
time, provides empirical evidence that alcohol consump-
tion affects men and women differently in HCV mortality.
Future research should examine whether the alcohol effect
on HCV mortality varies across racial/ethnic groups, as
they differ in the rate of chronic HCV infection, response
to treatment, and development of complications (Chen
and Morgan, 2006). It will also be useful to examine the
roles of other coinfections, such as HIV, in the relationship
between HAU and HCV mortality.
