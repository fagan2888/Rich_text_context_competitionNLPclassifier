Introduction
The procedure for withdrawal of land plots for state or
municipal needs is an inevitable component of legislation in
most countries of the world. This procedure is a kind of fee
for progress; the emergence of railroads, water supply mains,
sewerage systems, and other facilities ensuring the comfort
and well-being of citizens have led to "the reverse side of the
coin." Everything has its price, including the price of termi-
nating ownership rights.
The very problem of the withdrawal of land plots for pub-
lic (state and municipal) needs is multifaceted and may be
considered from philosophic, economic, sociological, and
other perspectives. Considering the many great works of cul-
ture and art (e.g., "Roadwork" by American writer Stephen
King, 1981; "Leviathan" by Russian film director Andrey
Zvyagintsev, 2014; and other works), it is possible to con-
duct research on the creative and artistic approaches of
authors to this problem.
Furthermore, the procedure of involuntary termination of
ownership rights is governed by legal rules that allow con-
sideration of both the interests of the affected party (the
owner of the plot) and the interests of the state and society.
The search for civilized means to solve this issue has been
conducted for many centuries. It is believed that the search
began in biblical times, when King Ahab in Samaria offered
Naboth compensation for the latter's vineyard ("Eminent
Domain," 2008). However, in its modern version, the con-
cept of the balance of private and public interests developed
after the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man
(1789) in France, which declared that ownership "is an invi-
olable and sacred right" and "no one may be deprived thereof
except in cases of an explicit social need established by law
and subject to fair and advanced compensation." In the
United States, a similar procedure appeared after the adop-
tion of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (1791),

Withdrawal of Land Plots for Public
Needs in Russia: Problems and Ways of
Search of Balance of Private and Public
Interests

Abstract
Within the framework of analysis of the current Russian legislature, scientific doctrine, and judicial practice regarding the
withdrawal of land plots from owners by redemption, the authors prove that, in addition to public needs (state and municipal),
there are public­private needs aimed at the pursuit of interests for certain members of society. Delegation of participation
in the withdrawal of private land plots for public­private needs by the authorities and reassignment to certain commercial
legal entities partially owned by the state often leads to social tensions because the society perceives many such cases of
withdrawal of land plots from civil owners as injustice. At the same time, considering the U.S. experience, the authors state
the interstate nature of this problem. This situation requires not only the development of legislation or changes in judicial
practice but also a change in the conceptual approach regarding the withdrawal of land plots for public and public­private
needs, and an enhancement of the axiological (value-conscious) approach, which should be considered by all branches of
government.

according to which "private property shall not be taken for a
public use without just compensation." In Russia, the system
of guarantees of ownership rights began to develop in the
beginning of the 19th century, when it was enshrined in law
(1810) that certain cases submitted for preliminary discus-
sion of the State Council include "cases of individual com-
pensation for the property withdrawn for State needs." Land
Codes 1922, 1970, 1991 as well as the current Land Code of
the Russian Federation dated October 25, 2001 (LC RF)
greatly contributed to the development of the system of land
plots withdrawal.
In all of these and many other regulations, legislators of
different countries attempted to define the thin line between
justice and state arbitrariness. The 20th century history
shows that states that attempted to focus on the protection of
public interests rather than on private interests ceased to
exist. It is necessary to extract lessons from history to avoid
repeating it. However, where is the line that separates the
selfishness of an individual citizen from social interests? In
addition, what are the criteria for allowing, in one case, a
sacrifice of one's interests in favor of everyone's interests
and, in another case, to forbid doing it?
Scientists from Russia (O. L. Altengova, A. I. Dikhtyar,
A. A. Zaviyalov, V. P. Kamyshansky, O. I. Krassov) and the-
orists from other countries (W. Baude, Robert L. Mills, C.
Walsh, J. Hathaway) have both been seeking an answer to
this question.
In this work, the authors suggest an axiological (value-
conscious) approach to the issue of withdrawal of land
plots for public needs, which focuses not only on the tech-
nical calculation of compensation or procedural actions of
state officials (with all the absolute importance of the lat-
ter) but also on the value-related aspects, rights, and legiti-
mate interests of ordinary citizens. The approach also
focuses on the means to reduce the pressure of the state on
citizens' lives and property, the search for a means to
increase the guarantees of their rights to land plots and real
estate, and the development of new approaches to the cal-
culation of compensation mechanism for their withdrawn
immovable property.
Private and Public Interests and Needs:
Available and Suggested Criteria for
Distinguishing One From the Other
Correlation of Private and Public Interests
Regarding the Issues of Termination of Rights to
Ownership to Land Plots
The issue of the differentiation of public and private inter-
ests extends outside the framework of legal research alone
and is closely connected with the essential philosophical,
ethical, social, and legal issue of the interrelation of the
individual and the state; this is basically insoluble beyond
the axiological method and beyond the research on the
system of values and hierarchical relations of social and
individual values (Aksenova, 2007). Identification of the
most clear boundaries of private and public interests can
resolve the essential issue; this will affect all aspects of
human relationships, including the correlation of freedom
and nonfreedom, initiative, the autonomy of will and stat-
utory regulations, and the limits of state intervention
(Antokolskaya, 1995).
One of the most successful definitions of "interest" was
suggested by R. Ihering, who believed that interest is the
material basis of law, and its main purpose is the adjustment
of interests in society and finding balance between them
(Ihering, 1991). Indeed, interest has a conceptual and defin-
ing role because a right that is not connected to or reflective
of vital interests is not of real value for people. Interests not
protected by rights are legally defenseless (Pershin, 2004).
It is beyond any doubt that the line between private and
public interests is conditional. The 19th century classics of
civil law noted that
in fact, the area of individual private interest is not sharply
separated from social public one; however, if ever such a
separation could occur, it would not bear that fruit which is
expected; conversely, it would make privacy and private legal
relations intolerable and impossible. (Kavelin, 2003)
We should agree with this approach of the impossibility of a
sharp demarcation between private and public interests
because any public interest in land is the aggregate of the
private interests (interests of citizens and their associations)
of those residing in a certain area. Furthermore, various citi-
zen associations may have different public (the aggregate of
private) interests that develop on a territorial (street, district
in a city) or subject basis (construction of schools, stadiums,
and shopping malls).
This approach makes it possible to distinguish public
interest, the implementation of which is objectively impor-
tant for all people residing in this area (e.g., construction of a
hospital complex and highway); in addition, public interests
(interest of certain social groups) and the interests of these
groups may contradict each other, private interests (interests
of individual citizens) or state (municipal) interests. For
example, one group of citizens may prefer to construct a
casino in an urban quarter, whereas the other group may pre-
fer to construct a mosque, and a third may prefer a shopping
mall with a parking lot. Then, a question arises regarding
whether termination of land rights of certain persons with the
objective to transfer it to others is just.
A typical example of a conflict of private and public inter-
ests was the reconstruction of the central part of Krasnodar;
this decision was adopted in 2006. Consideration of this
issue made many Russian scientists ask, "What are the
municipal needs and interests in this case?" The scientists
noted that
Anisimov and Ryzhenkov 3
one should have a great imagination to suggest that on February
10, 2006 it became necessary to meet exactly the municipal
needs . . . to withdraw the land plots and to demolish 58 thousand
single-storey houses located in the total area of approximately
two thousand hectares in the central part of Krasnodar.
At the same time, the land plots were to be purchased by
the municipal entities not by private investors defined as a
result of being selected to participate in the reconstruction of
the central part of Krasnodar (Kamyshansky, 2006). A similar
conflict occurred in 2006 on the outskirts of Moscow in
Yuzhnoye Butovo district, where Moscow authorities decided
to withdraw 54 ha of land, to demolish single-story houses
and to use that area to construct elite apartment buildings. A
portion of the residents agreed to voluntary removal; the other
residents organized a number of civil disobedience acts.
Citizens losing their property in favor of the enrichment
of private individuals will always be considered an injustice.
In Butovo, injustice was the reason for a protest by owners of
individual houses subject to demolition against the city
administration's decision to transfer their land plots to a mul-
tistory commercial construction project. The plot owners
assessed the situation as a dispute between two private own-
ers (the buyer and the seller) primarily regarding the value of
the immovable property for which the buyer used adminis-
trative pressure to conserve funds (Volovich, 2008).
Regarding the attribution of reconstruction of Krasnodar
center to municipal needs, we should note that, at the moment
of reconstruction, this was not the case. According to the cur-
rent legislation (Art. 56.3 Land Code), public needs include
the demolition of blocks of flats, followed by construction of
modern residential buildings in the same location; however,
the mass demolition of individual residential buildings is no
longer stipulated by the current legislation. Construction of
new residential buildings instead of dilapidated and hazardous
blocks of flats is a typical case of public­private interests.
The private or public nature of the Sochi 2014 Olympic
Games is equally ambiguous. Of 4,212 ha of land, which was
intended for the construction of 243 Olympic venues, 3,553 ha
belonged to the state, and the remaining 679 ha belonged to
private individuals (Chudakova, 2008). There were 1,865 land
plotsand259flatslocatedinthisarea("StatisticsonWithdrawal
and Provision," 2014). It is not surprising that in Sochi in May
2008, 200 residents of the Imereti Lowland protested against
withdrawal of land and demolition of their homes to construct
Olympic venues. As a result of the clashes with the police,
people who defended their properties were hurt. The governor
of Krasnodar Territory said that the actions were necessary "to
abruptly stop all illegal actions of these pseudoprotesters who
are trying to put their personal benefit above the public one
which implies the 2014 Olympic Games" (Strantsova, 2009).
Such a citizen response can be understood through the
traditional understanding of law by the Russian popula-
tion; this is not as officially prescribed "totality of manda-
tory rules of law," but rather as law as social order based
on social agreement and compromise as a means to imple-
ment freedom, justice, and equality (Livshits, 2001).
This raises the question of whether Olympics are public
needs and how to incorporate citizens' opinions, which no
one had inquired of before deciding on issues that directly
affected them. It appears that this situation is another typical
example of "public-private" needs; for these, the compulsory
termination of private land ownership rights should be con-
ducted solely in compliance with procedures that consider
residents' opinions by means of public hearings.
The situation in which the termination of citizens'rights to
land is necessary to implement a "foreign" state or municipal
interest appears to be more complicated. For example, it is
occasionally necessary for an urban district (municipal entity)
to build an aeration station for processing sewage. The sta-
tion's construction within city boundaries is prohibited by
sanitary rules. Therefore, such construction occurs in the
countryside surrounding the city and can lead to the with-
drawal of land plots from individuals for municipal needs.
There is no doubt that the residents of this rural area are against
such construction. Therefore, in this case, a conflict of munici-
pal but not private interests is observed. There are no clear
legal means to resolve such conflicts between the interests of
residents of different municipalities in Russia, although it is
obvious that the dispute's settlement should involve participa-
tion of a state-authorized constituent entity of the Russian
Federation. Special focus regarding this problem should be on
the lack of clearly defined procedures for the withdrawal of
land plots belonging to one public (municipal) owner in favor
of another (e.g., for construction of the said aeration station).
Thus, one should distinguish private (individual and
social groups) and public interests (state and municipal). In
our view, private interests can be met by establishing a pri-
vate easement but not through withdrawal of a land plot.
Public (state and municipal) interests can be realized both by
establishing a public easement and through withdrawal of
land plots for public needs. Public­private interests, which,
in Russia, involve certain commercial legal entities partially
owned by the state, have an intermediate position. These
legal entities perform a certain public function. Therefore,
some of them are entitled to participate in procedures for
withdrawal of land plots by redemption for public needs.
Consequently, these entities acquire a right to ownership of
the withdrawn land plots and the facilities constructed there.
Lack of clear regulation of this procedure often leads to
abuses, violates public notions of freedom and justice, and
often appears immoral in the eyes of the population.
Concept of Public Needs Existence of Which is
a Ground for Withdrawal of a Land Plot From a
Private Owner
In the scientific doctrine, legislation, and juridical practice, the
question regarding appropriate interpretation of the legal
4 SAGE Open
category of state and municipal needs remains unresolved.
Land legislation does not contain such a definition. The "state
needs" referred to in the legislation on the bidding procedure
for goods and services'procurement for state needs have exces-
sively specific land relations, and therefore cannot be applied.
At the same time, Article 49 Land Code includes a list of
cases that delineate when land plots may be withdrawn from
private owners for state or municipal needs. This list includes
the following: the implementation of international treaties of
the Russian Federation; construction or reconstruction of
state (or local) facilities (subject to the lack of other possible
modes of construction and reconstruction of these objects),
such as federal power system and regional power system
facilities; nuclear power facilities; defense and state security
facilities; and federal transport and communication facilities.
The list of objects is not exhaustive because "other grounds"
are also noted in that article.
Public needs are usually understood as the needs of the
Russian Federation, its constituent entities and municipalities.
These needs are based on the property of citizens and legal
entities that express a common interest, and are related to the
protection of the fundamentals of constitutional order, morality,
health, rights, legitimate interests of other persons, defense and
security. The satisfaction of these needs, which are generally
listed in the federal law, is impossible except by means of an
involuntary termination of the right of private ownership while
balancing private and public interests (Altengova, 2012).
It appears that this understanding is excessively narrow
because the list of state and municipal needs is much wider,
which follows from Article 49 LC RF (particularly given that
this list can be extended by federal laws). However, the
understanding of "exclusiveness" of public needs enshrined
in the law and confirmed in juridical practice makes it impos-
sible to redistribute land plots for the purpose of a simple
increase in the tax collection from a certain area.
This is the position that Russian courts usually hold. Thus,
in one case, the arbitration court invalidated the resolution of
the local government on the withdrawal of land for municipal
needs because no documents proving the exceptional need to
place facilities exactly on the disputed plot of land were sub-
mitted. From the case materials, it is clear that the goal was a
withdrawal of the agricultural land plot from a closed joint-
stock company to place facilities for development of the raw
mineral material base of local industrial enterprises and to
implement the "Ceramics Factory" and "ISUZU and FIAT
Truck Centre" investment projects. As was noted in the court
decision, the Land Code of Russia does not stipulate with-
drawal of land plots for state or municipal needs with the
objective to attract investors to raise money for the municipal
budget and to create new jobs. Therefore, in this case, the
local authorities had no legitimate grounds for withdrawal of
the land plot (Resolution of the Federal Arbitration Court of
Povolzhsky District of 15.06.2009).
In consideration of the repeated attempts to withdraw land
plots from private individuals to transfer to other private
individuals, it is necessary to prove the legality of this behav-
ior. Many Russian scientists believe that the lack of a clear
definition of state and municipal needs in the legislation
makes it possible to interpret the definitions to the prejudice
of private owners. The definitions may often include not only
state needs but also the private economic interests of public
authorities as ordinary owners. Therefore, it is necessary to
establish more precise criteria regarding the concept of com-
monwealth interests (Tuzhilova-Ordanskaya, 2007).
Other authors suggest using the term public needs because
the concept "state and municipal needs" does not always
coincide with the actual needs of society. These authors
believe that the construction of roads, mining, and similar
activities are often conducted not by the state but by com-
mercial organizations; therefore, these cases are unlikely to
be legitimately referred to as "state needs" (Syrodoev, 2004).
Indeed, the proposed term is now widespread in the legis-
lation of many countries. In Spain, withdrawal of a land plot
is possible solely if it is required due to "social expediency or
social interests"; in Sweden, it is "important public inter-
ests." In Italy, "common interests" are required; in Portugal,
"public interests" are necessary. In Germany, the purposes of
"commonwealth" are referenced, and in the United States,
the term used is "socially useful purposes" (Dikhtyar &
Kleimenova, 2008).
In general, we should agree with this proposal. With regard
to Russian conditions, it should be noted that, in addition to
private and public needs, there is an objective possibility,
indirectly noted in the Russian legislation (but not named
directly), of withdrawal of land plots based on the initiative of
a number of legal entities to construct facilities that perform
public functions that we propose to call "public-private facili-
ties." These facilities include sports stadiums, hotels, and elite
residential complexes. The possibility of withdrawal of land
plots for such construction is currently limited.
Lack of understanding of a clear distinction between pub-
lic and private needs leads to the common position of the
complete impossibility of withdrawal of land plots for public
needs when there is a subsequent transfer to ownership
(lease) by private individuals who fulfill certain public
(social) objectives regarding their activities.
For example, in one court decision, it was stated that with-
drawal of land plots, with reference to state and municipal
needs, to provide these to other persons for construction is
not allowed according toArticle 49 Land Code of the Russian
Federation (Resolution of the Federal Arbitration Court of
Moscow District of May 26, 2004). . I. Krassov believes
that a land plot may not be withdrawn for private needs;
therefore, private land property may be withdrawn for use
only by state or municipal entities. Private property may be
transformed solely into state or municipal property.
Accordingly, only state or municipal institutions may use it
(Krassov, 2000).
In contrast, other scientists believe that local authorities
who reserve land or facilities for municipal needs are entitled
Anisimov and Ryzhenkov 5
to provide for the construction of not only municipal proper-
ties or facilities for its use in accordance with local authority
functions but also certain other facilities for private needs
(Zavialov, 2007). Ugo Mattei notes that, currently, the com-
monwealth involves not only the interests of the entire state
but also its certain agencies and private companies that oper-
ate in society's interest. Consequently, the legislator may
admit withdrawal of property from one private owner with
its subsequent transfer into another person's private property
for its use in society's interest (Mattei & Sukhanov, 1999).
We share a similar position, considering that, in the mod-
ern world, redistribution of spatially limited land resources is
inevitable. Therefore, the problem of law is not to trail the
objective modernization process of urban area development
but to set goals and incentives for the development of this
process while guaranteeing owners' rights.
However, supporting the possibility of involuntary with-
drawal of land plots from private individuals with their further
use by commercial legal entities in society's interest, we con-
sider it necessary to comply with the criteria of balancing pri-
vate and public interests based on the understanding of law as a
tool for the provision of justice. Thus, a suitable criterion was
suggested by the European Court of Human Rights. In the judg-
ment in the "Gladysheva v. Russia" case (application no.
7097/10) of December 6, 2011, the Court notes that any interfer-
ence with property not only must be legal and have a legitimate
objective but also satisfy the requirement of proportionality.
The Court states that there must be an equitable balance between
the needs arising from the common interests of society and the
need to protect basic human rights; the tendency to such an
equitable balance is typical of the whole Convention. The
required balance will not be achieved if the interested person
bears the individual and excessive burden (Case "Gladysheva v.
Russia" (application no. 7097/10) of December 6, 2011). The
search for clear criteria on "proportional interference" with pri-
vate affairs requires the development of new warranties of the
rights of the property owners as well.
Thus, what is meant by public (state and municipal)
needs, considering the evaluative nature of this category?
Public needs are the needs of the population of Russia
(region, municipality) stipulated by the federal laws, the sat-
isfaction of which is impossible without withdrawal of land
plots with just compensation to private individuals for trans-
fer into ownership by the Russian Federation, its constituent
entities and municipalities. Their further use must be for
infrastructure, defense and security, power industry, spe-
cially protected natural areas, and international treaties'
implementation facilities.
Public­private needs are the needs of a number of social
groups that are stipulated by federal laws and related to subsur-
face management, construction of facilities for health care, edu-
cation, sports, residential buildings and other similar facilities.
These are fulfilled by commercial legal entities partially owned
by the state by means of the involuntary withdrawal of land
plots from private individuals with a guarantee of their rights.
Subjects and Procedure of Withdrawal
of Land Plots for Public Needs:
Pros and Cons of the Current Legal
Regulation
Initially, after the entry of the Land Code (2001) into force,
the level of guarantees of the rights of private land owners in
Russia was sufficiently high and did not cause any particular
comments. Guarantees of the rights of land owners during
withdrawal of the land plots for state or municipal needs were
defined in the Land Code (Article 55 enshrined the prior and
fair compensation of the cost of land plots; Article 63 pointed
to the necessity for a prior notice of owners 1 year before the
supposed withdrawal), the Civil Code (Articles 279, 282),
and the Urban Development Code. The latter, in particular, to
ensure a reasonable balance of private and public interests,
stipulated the necessity to link the withdrawal of land plots
for state and municipal needs to the content of territorial plan-
ning documents of the Russian Federation, its constituent
entities and municipalities (such a necessity is now stipulated
by Part 4 Article 9 Urban Development Code).
The guarantee is based on the fact that state authorities
and local authorities may not adopt decisions on land reser-
vation, on withdrawal, including by redemption, of land plots
for state or municipal needs, on transfer of land from one
category into another if territorial planning documents are
not available, except in cases stipulated by federal laws. This
rule means that the general layout and other urban planning
documentation should include the planned future state or
municipal facilities, the construction of which requires with-
drawal of land plots from private individuals. Accordingly,
the population will be able to familiarize themselves with
these layouts during public hearings.
The statutory system for land withdrawal relation subjects
was logical as well; they were represented by bodies of state
or local authorities as one component, and citizens and legal
entities as the other component. No exceptions to the general
rules were available; no legal entities had privileges; how-
ever, exceptions to this general procedure gradually began to
emerge.
For the first time, a special legal procedure of with-
drawal of land plots for state or municipal needs was intro-
duced by a special federal law for the construction of the
Olympic venues in Sochi (Federal Law No. 310-FZ of
01.12.2007 "On Organization of the XXII Olympic Winter
Games . . ."), then for the construction of the facilities nec-
essary to organize the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit in Vladivostok. Later, the procedure was supple-
mented by two other federal laws governing the withdrawal
of land plots for public needs in territories annexed to
Moscow (as a result of its expansion; Federal Law No.
43-FZ of 05.04.2013 "On Peculiarities of Regulation of
Certain Legal Relations Associated . . ."), and related to the
areas required for the construction of the 2018 Football
World Cup facilities (Federal Law No. 108-FZ of 07.06.2013
6 SAGE Open
"On Organization in the Russian Federation of the 2018
FIFA . . ."). These laws provide conditions for shorter with-
drawal of land plots (area planning designs are accepted
without public hearings; withdrawal is allowed if there are
no approved area planning documentation; in the "new
Moscow" until December 31, 2015, in case of withdrawal
of land plots or other immovable property, the owner shall
be notified of the forthcoming withdrawal at least 5 months
before the forthcoming withdrawal).
After the analysis of all four of the abovementioned fed-
eral laws, O. A. Zolotova notes that they indicate unification
of a special procedure of land withdrawal for state need. The
laws include the establishment of reduced terms for the
adoption of administrative and judicial decisions; simplified
formation of land plots and issue of corresponding cadastral
certificates; extrajudicial withdrawal of land plots from state
and municipal institutions and unitary enterprises; and a spe-
cial procedure for compensation of the cost of withdrawn
land plots (Zolotova, 2012).
All these exceptions to the rules could be explained by poli-
ticians' desire to hasten the organization of Olympic events
that were important for them or the summit in Vladivostok.
However, recent amendments to the Land Code of the Russian
Federation follow this trend, which leads to a further overall
decline in the guarantees of private property rights; this is
grounds for discussions regarding the fairness and appropri-
ateness of these procedures. How does this manifest?
The latest amendments to the Land Code of the Russian
Federation (Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 499-
FZ of December 31, 2014 "On Amendments to the Land
Code . . .") introduced a new right of commercial companies
specifically referred to in the law to participate in the proce-
dures of involuntary withdrawal of land plots by redemption
for public needs. Three types of such organizations are noted
in the Land Code of the Russian Federation: subjects of natu-
ral monopolies; legal entities that are licensed to perform
work provision of which the means of withdrawal of land
plots is stipulated by Article 49 Land Code of the Russian
Federation; mining companies (It.1 Art. 56.4 Land Code).
What is their authority?
1. They are entitled to apply for withdrawal of land
plots for state needs at competent state agencies.
2. They are entitled to apply to the court for involuntary
withdrawal of a land plot and the immovable prop-
erty on it if, within 90 days after the rightholder's
receipt of a draft agreement on withdrawal of immov-
able property, the owner fails to submit the signed
agreement on withdrawal of immovable property.
3. If the decision on withdrawal is made based on an
application of the Russian Highways State Company,
the agreement on withdrawal of immovable property is
concluded on behalf of the Russian Federation by the
said State Company, and the signing of the agreement
on the part of the federal executive body is not required.
4. Compensation for withdrawn land plots and (or)
immovable property located on them is performed at
the expense of the corresponding budget of the bud-
getary system of the Russian Federation and, if the
decision on withdrawal is made based on an applica-
tion for withdrawal filed by the abovementioned
organizations at the expense of these organizations.
5. After termination of the right of private ownership of
the withdrawn plots and immovable property located
onthem,theybecomeownedbytheRussianFederation,
a constituent entity of the Russian Federation, munici-
pality, or a company that filed an application for with-
drawal on the basis of which the decision on withdrawal
of the land plot and the immovable property located on
it was made (Art. 56.2-56.11 Land Code).
The above brief review shows a sharp decline in guaran-
tees of the rights of private ownership of land and the emer-
gence of the possibility for commercial legal entities
(partially owned by the state) to actively participate in the
withdrawal of land plots from private owners with the land
plots' transfer into private ownership by such commercial
organizations.
In our view, there is a need to develop a doctrinal concept
of balance of private and public interests that meets the crite-
ria of fairness, appropriateness, and reasonableness, and con-
tains the required mechanism of guarantees of land rights of
the citizens and their associations.
1. Interference with the rights of owners with the objec-
tive to limit or terminate the rights shall be propor-
tionate in nature. For this purpose, it is necessary to
distinguish public and public­private interests:

(linear facilities: electric and other networks, commu-
nication facilities, roads, railways, pipelines), space
facilities, power industry facilities, implementation of
international treaties, and the creation of specially
protected natural areas (reserves and national parks).
Expansion of this list may be allowed solely by means
of amendments to the law (Art. 49 Land Code Russian
Federation).
·
· In turn, the list of public­private needs cannot be
exhaustive; however, it is necessary to clearly define
the approximate parameters. The list should include
demolition of dilapidated and hazardous housing
(slums) and construction of modern buildings in their
place (under the agreement on development of built-
up areas, Art. 46.2 Urban Development Code); con-
struction of sports facilities; subsurface management;
and construction of private roads and hospitals. The
main criterion for the distinction of public and
Anisimov and Ryzhenkov 7
public­private facilities is the extent of their common
usefulness (for the benefit of all citizens, if they are
roads or electric networks, for the benefit of a portion
of the citizens, if they are stadiums); the purpose of
use (indirect profit [electric networks] or the absence
of such a purpose at all [military facilities] for public
needs; the direct profit [for public­private needs]);
the type of ownership into which the plot is trans-
ferred, state or municipal (for public needs); or pri-
vate property (for public­private needs). In other
words, the criteria consist of terms of withdrawal of a
land plot for public needs; the land plot is transferred
into state (municipal) ownership and used by legal
entities on the basis of the right of permanent (per-
petual) use (e.g., institutions or federal state-owned
enterprises). For public­private purposes, a plot is
transferred into ownership of a commercial legal
entity partially owned by the state (e.g., according to
Art. 7.1 Federal Law No.7-FZ of 12.01.1996 "On
Nonprofit Organizations," property transferred to a
state-owned corporation of the Russian Federation
shall be ownership of the state-owned corporation).
However, this criterion is optional because, in both
cases, the withdrawn plot may be leased.
At the same time, the relational subject for the withdrawal
of land plots for public­private needs may not be any com-
mercial legal entity but solely a legal entity partially owned
by the state (typical example of which is Russian Railways
Open Joint-Stock Company; the percentage of shares owned
by the Russian Federation is 100).
2. The issue of the equitable calculation of the compen-
sation paid to owners of withdrawn property plays an
important role in the procedure of withdrawal of land
plots for public and public­private needs.
Unfortunately, currently, with the lack of calculation
methods for fair compensation, courts nearly always
side with the plaintiff (authority) and totally ignore
expert calculations on behalf of the defendant (citi-
zen). Analysis of extensive judicial practice shows
that, in "political" cases associated with the mass
withdrawal of land plots from citizens and their asso-
ciations (e.g., in connection with the Olympic Games
in Sochi in 2014), the judicial authorities do not con-
sider the arguments of citizens that the estimated
value of their property is understated. Thus, in one
such case, the court referred to Item 26 Article 15
Federal Law "On Organization of the XXII Olympic
Winter Games and the XI Paralympic Winter Games
in 2014 in Sochi, Development of Sochi as a
Mountain Resort and Inclusion in Certain Legislative
Acts of the Russian Federation" of December 1,
2007, and stated that the redemption price of the land
plots and (or) other immovable property located on
them, as well as the amount of losses to be recovered
in connection with the withdrawal may not exceed
the amounts specified in the evaluation report
(Decision of August 21, 2013 No.VS-10286/13
"On Refusal to Submit the Case to the Presidium of
the Supreme Arbitration Court . . . "), which was
drafted by a state unitary enterprise. Cases of ignor-
ing all losses of citizens in connection with the land
plot withdrawal during the compensation calculation
are as common.
Regarding the method of losses' calculation, it should be
noted that the value of a land plot and its buildings for a citi-
zen is determined not by its market value but by the possibil-
ity to maintain the usual habitat. According to our view, this
concept includes proximity to the native places and graves of
relatives, maintenance of the circle of communication, the
existing modes of life and much more. At the same time, the
older the owners of the property are, the more important the
listed factors are for them. These factors are often noted in
applications filed with the executive authorities and the
courts by citizens who have been evicted from their homes
and land; they provide the authorities' focus on the fact that
these are the houses where their ancestors lived and died,
where their children and grandchildren were born. There
have been cases of suicides by citizens who did not want to
move from their homes into the suggested panel building
apartments (Kravchenko, 2013).
It can be said without prejudice that the equal value com-
pensation will always be incomplete because, during the
determination of such compensation, the listed circumstances
are not considered. Therefore, we can draw the obvious con-
clusion that the compensation paid to a citizen upon with-
drawal of a land plot and other immovable property should
always be greater than the value of its market value by the
amount necessary to compensate for, conditionally, nonpecu-
niary damage. The determination of the amount of compensa-
tion, which does not allow a citizen to acquire any property
with similar consumer properties, is extremely unacceptable.
In a state focused on the satisfaction of the interests of its citi-
zens, the social factor should be decisive in the legal regula-
tion on withdrawal of land plots for state and municipal needs.
In consideration of withdrawal, inevitably, the mechanisms
established by the legislation should provide for the possibil-
ity of overcoming the negative effects of withdrawal, at least
to an extent. In this regard, not only financial but also natural
compensation for citizens (at their option) by means of provi-
sion of a similar land plot in the area where they had previ-
ously lived should be provided. The provision of land plots
that are as close as possible to the location of the previous
land plot will maintain the previous owner's habitat and circle
of communication, and thus minimize the negative conse-
quences of the withdrawal procedure (Zaviyalov, 2010).
A similar rule is already included in Item 2 Article 351
Civil Code of Ukraine, according to which a person whose
8 SAGE Open
ownership right is subject to termination shall be entitled to
request provision of another land plot, the value of which is
considered during the determination of the redemption price;
this plot shall be located within the area that is subject to the
powers of the relevant local government body or executive
authority (e.g., within the city or another municipal entity).
The positive experiences of other countries should be noted
as well. Thus, the amendments to the Michigan Constitution
(United States) stipulated that, in case of withdrawal of private
property, the authorities shall prove that the purpose of with-
drawal is not a transfer of the property to private individuals
with the objective of economic development or increasing tax
revenues. At the same time, 125% of the market value of the
withdrawn land plots and other immovable property must be
paid to their owners (Rukhtin, 2007). In fact, the excess of the
market value is the nonpecuniary damage.
We propose a calculation of additional compensation for
such owners based on the extent of the nonpecuniary damage
(from 1% to 50% above the market value) associated with the
specific situation of a citizen or a legal entity, whose land plots
are subject to withdrawal for public or public­private needs
(e.g., in accordance with the period of use of the land plot by
the family; the amount must be different if this period is com-
posed of 1 year or 50 years). A similar scheme should be
applied to companies that are subject to withdrawal (in accor-
dance with the number of jobs or the value of products).
It appears that the courts must be provided strict instruc-
tions to consider the estimated value of land plots and
immovable property; this can be provided by independent
appraisers and submitted by the owners of the withdrawn
land plots and immovable property. These appraisers, in our
opinion, should be certified and integrated into professional
self-regulatory organizations. It is reasonable to make greater
use of mediation to reduce the tension of conflicts.
This issue needs further discussion. In addition, because
the state does not provide owners whose land was withdrawn
with equivalent compensation, it promotes the destruction of
the fundamental rules of cooperation and trust in society.
People begin to believe that the state treats them unfairly,
remembering the informal rule denoting that the benefits and
costs of government actions should be distributed propor-
tionally among the members of the society. This belief leads
to a kind of loss that is reflected in the fact that, for example,
people no longer invest in their land due to well-founded
concern that the latter will be involuntarily purchased with-
out sufficient compensation. In the long run, this belief inevi-
tably affects the overall economic well-being of the society
(Afanasieva, 2013).
3. Mandatory availability of territorial planning docu-
ments (general layout), land use and development
regulations, planning designs in a municipal entity. In
addition, mandatory availability of regional and local
standards of urban design must be a binding condi-
tion. The essence, for example, of local regulations is
that they establish a set of estimate indicators of the
minimum permissible provision level of the local
population with electricity, heat, gas, water supply
and sewerage facilities; roads of local significance;
and physical culture and mass sports, education,
health care, disposal of solid household waste facili-
ties as well as land improvement facilities. In addi-
tion, the regulations contain estimate indicators of the
maximum permissible level of territorial availability
of such facilities for the municipal entities' popula-
tion (villages, urban districts).
This document should not only be published and posted
on the Internet but also endure public hearing procedures,
which is currently not stipulated by Article 29.4 Urban
Development Code.
Regarding facilities of municipal significance that have a
future construction plan, the emergence and discussion with
the municipal entity's population will increase the awareness
of citizens regarding the authorities' plans and mitigate the
potential social conflicts between the government and soci-
ety. The results of the public hearings must be mandatory.
4. In terms of withdrawal of land plots for both public
and public­private needs, not only the whole package
of approved urban planning documentation (as noted
above) but also evidence that the facility may not be
located elsewhere, as well as evidence that the exclu-
sive necessity of the very facility on the withdrawn plot
is in the interests of the local population, is required.
The possibility of available special (simplified) proce-
dures for withdrawal of land plots for public or public­
private needs must be completely excluded.
This conclusion can also be justified by the fact that, in
contrast to densely populated Europe, Russia is a minimally
developed country; its huge spaces remain uninhabited with-
out infrastructure facilities. Therefore, if it is necessary to
hold various summits and Olympics, instead of the demoli-
tion of homes and eviction of residents, it is much more rea-
sonable to develop the steppes and wastelands.
5. It is necessary to govern the procedure of return of a
withdrawn plot to its owner if there is no longer a
public need for it. This problem occurs constantly,
not only in Russian judicial practice but also in the
practice of European states. For example, the
Constitutional Court of Austria considered an inter-
esting case for the return of a land plot withdrawn for
state needs. Financial compensation was paid to the
owner; however, 3 years later, the owner discovered
that the withdrawn land plot was not used for public
purposes. Consequently, his recourse to the general
jurisdiction court was to request a return of the land
plot (after returning the compensation); the request
was denied with reference to the civil legislation. The
court held that the subjective civil right ceased to
Anisimov and Ryzhenkov 9
exist due to the withdrawal of the plot; consequently,
the plaintiff's claims had no substantive basis. When
the owner appealed to the Constitutional Court, he
won. This case is connected to "termination of the
subjective constitutional private ownership rights is
to be associated not with the moment of the actual
withdrawal of the land plot but with implementation
of the purpose for which the land plot was with-
drawn" (Gadzhiev, 2006, p. 34).
As is noted by the European Court of Human Rights, if
there is no withdrawal of land for a longtime after the decision
on compulsory expropriation, such withdrawal is a violation
of Art. 1 Protocol No. 1 to the Convention "On Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms" of 04.11.1950.
This withdrawal disturbs the "fair balance" that must exist
between the protection of ownership rights and the require-
ments of common interest (Sporrong and Lnnroth v. Sweden.
Judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, 1982).
Fulfillment of this requirement often encounters various
obstacles in Russia. For example, a resident of Tyumen Region
A (owner of a land plot and immovable property) appealed to
the district court via a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the orders
of the head of the administration of Nizhnetavdinsky district
on September 22, 2008. "On Withdrawal of Land Plots for
Municipal Needs," the owner alleged this order did not include
a list of facilities that were to be located on these land plots,
and it did not note whether they belonged to facilities of
municipal significance or whether they complied with the gen-
eral layout of the corresponding municipal entity. As a result
of judicial review, this order was canceled. Similar court deci-
sions on similar cases are not rare (Krylova, 2013).
Thus, a clear legislative framework provision for binding
fulfillment of the withdrawal purpose may limit the public
authorities' appetite and reduce the frequency of private
property withdrawal cases.
Legal Structure of "Eminent Domain"
in the U.S. Law: Comparative Legal
Analysis of its Attractiveness for Russia
Pursuant to the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. constitution, a
government can acquire real and personal belongings of a
citizen for public purpose, and the person must be provided
just compensation. The Fifth Amendment's public use clause
is applicable to state governments through the Fourteenth
Amendment Clause. Therefore, the taking of property for
private purpose is unconstitutional. Legislatures can also del-
egate the power of eminent domain to agencies for public
purposes. The government's advantage in exercising the
power of eminent domain need not benefit a large number of
people. The use can be solely for a community of people or
residents of an area. However, the benefit should not be for
solely one person ("Eminent Domain," 2015).
Initially, Congress did not provide for the right of federal
authorities to eminent domain if the land was needed to
implement federal projects. More than 50 years after the
founding of the United States, the Supreme Court confirmed
the absence of the federal government's right to eminent
domain. From the founding until the Civil War, the federal
government was believed to have eminent domain power
solely within the District of Columbia and the territories but
not within states. The federal government acquired the right
to take land through eminent domain after the Supreme Court
established the existence of this power in the 1875 case of
Kohl v. United States; this power is now taken for granted
(Baude, 2013).
To exercise the power of eminent domain to ensure the
public good, the government must prove that four elements
are present: (a) private property, (b) must be taken, (c) for
public use, (d) and with just compensation. It is very impor-
tant for the last element that the price is the market price.
Crops, grass, trees, minerals, and all other items located on
the land plot withdrawn for public use are considered.
Condemnation proceedings are conducted as quickly as
possible, and consist of two phases: proceedings that relate
to the right of the condemner to take the property and pro-
ceedings to set the amount of compensation to be paid for the
property taken ("Eminent Domain," 2008).
The abovementioned 14th Amendment requires that a
taking must be for "public use" to be allowable. In the 1954
case of Berman v. Parker, the Supreme Court of the United
States decided that "public use" could be interpreted as for a
"public purpose" ("Eminent Domain Takings for Private
Development," 2015). The Court upheld the use of eminent
domain to develop slum areas for possible sale to private
interests. The purpose of the act in question was to improve
areas that were injurious to the public health, safety, morals,
and welfare of the community (Mills, 2015). However, this
understanding of "slum areas" is controversial.
In the case of City of Las Vegas Downtown Redevelopment
Agency v. Pappas, the Supreme Court of Nevada agreed that the
city of Las Vegas was in a state of "blight," and thus gave offi-
cial permission for the alienation of property to construct a park-
ing garage that served several casinos. The Court concluded that
the center of the city suffered from the economic downturn,
which involved downward trends in the business community,
relocation of existing business outside of the community, busi-
ness failures, and loss of sales or visitor volumes. However, it is
clear that virtually any area of any city may occasionally experi-
ence some crisis economic phenomena, including loss of visi-
tors as a source of income (Afanasieva, 2013).
In the judgment on the case of Poletown Neighbourhood
Council v. City of Detroit, the Michigan Supreme Court sup-
ported the planned purchase of a large plot of land to con-
struct a General Motors assembly plant, meaning, in this case,
the need for Detroit's economic development as the public
purpose. In the judgment on the Hawaii Housing Authority v.
Midklif case, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the constitu-
tionality of the Hawaii Land Reform Act of 1967 providing
for the possibility of the withdrawal of land plots to reduce
the concentration of land belonging to a number of large land-
10 SAGE Open
owners. Subsequently, after the purchase, the land was sup-
posed to be leased (Krassov, 1993).
In 2005, the Supreme Court issued a largely unpopular
decision in the case of Kelo v. City of New London, expand-
ing the interpretation of "public purpose" further. In the deci-
sion, the court held that the government could take private
property to transfer it to another private owner for an eco-
nomic development purpose, claiming that the economic
growth enjoyed by the community from new private devel-
opments could constitute a valid public purpose. This opened
the door for developers planning shopping centers and other
similar construction projects to look to the government to
take any private property that may prevent their plans
("Eminent Domain Takings for Private Development,"
2015). However, the problem included the fact that the U.S.
legislation has no official definition of "economic develop-
ment," and state acts contain vague references to this term.
Consequently, the main conclusion of the Kelo case was that
thereafter, government authorities could perform compul-
sory withdrawal of property from a private owner to develop
private companies, when this property had no public purpose
except for the development of the local economy. In addi-
tion, following this judgment by the Supreme Court, 43
states have now reformed their laws to better protect prop-
erty owners and have limited the government's eminent-
domain-related authority. Seven states' high courts have
stepped in post-Kelo to protect the rights of homeowners
against eminent domain abuse. The high courts of Hawaii,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Missouri, New Jersey, and
Rhode Island have all ruled in favor of property owners and
against eminent domain for private gain (Walsh, 2009).
However, C. Kerekes and D. Stansel found "virtually no
evidence" of eminent domain's economic benefit. The
researchers found no statistically significant relation between
eminent domain activity and the level of government reve-
nue. In this regard, we should support the conclusion that
private property is a fundamental tenet of the free market
system. When individuals are allowed to use their property in
the manner they deem fit, the most efficient use of property
becomes a rational behavior. In turn, tax revenues are maxi-
mized as individuals benefit from the value of their property
(Hathaway, 2015).
The list of types of "public purpose" is not exhaustive in
the United States, and may include involuntary withdrawal of
private property for the construction of schools, streets, high-
ways, parks, airports, dams, water reservoirs, construction of
public housing, hospitals and public buildings (including
those resulting from the elimination of slums), and the con-
struction of oil pipelines. In the latter case, the legislation and
the judicial practice require the establishment, where possi-
ble, of easements instead of the full withdrawal of land plots.
This trend is caused by the increased withdrawal of land plots
from owners for public needs (e.g., in the state of Texas) due
to hydraulic fracturing (fracking) for oilfield activity. In these
cases, landowners are encountering increased pressure from
pipeline companies to take land for easements ("Eminent
Domain Texas," 2015). In this regard, the Russian legislation
should include that land may be withdrawn solely if there is
no other location of public or public­private facilities or
establishment of easements is impossible.
Another trend, which is equally important and worthy of
support, is the availability of large powers by constituent
entities of the federation (states) in the United States for ter-
mination of rights of private ownership of land plots
("Eminent Domain Update," 2006). Much of this power
belongs to municipalities, which may adopt regulations on
this matter. For example, in Queen Creek (state of Arizona),
the Town Council unanimously approved a resolution pro-
hibiting the condemnation of private property for economic
development purposes (Local Legislation on Eminent
Domain, 2015). Russia as well as the United States is a fed-
eration; however, the possibility of legal regulation of land
ownership relations (in terms of their withdrawal) by con-
stituent entities representative of state power from the
Russian Federation (territories, regions) is very limited. It
appears that the U.S. experience should be further studied
and introduced. For example, at the constituent entity level
of the Russian Federation, such endowment of power would
increase the volume of guarantees of citizens'rights to reflect
the regional specifics. Therefore, we cannot agree with the
theorists believing that to protect the rights and legitimate
interests of owners and other right holders of land, it is nec-
essary to specify the rule of Item "c" Paragraph 1 Article 72
Constitution of the Russian Federation, which states that
"issues of emergence, limitation and termination of the right
of ownership of land plots shall fall within the sole compe-
tence of the Russian Federation" (Balin, 2011, p. 8).
In our view, the task is exactly the opposite; it is necessary
to develop and expand the joint competence area of the
Russian Federation and its constituent entities to increase the
latter's land relations rights.
Providing a positive assessment of many aspects of the
legal regulation of the withdrawal of land plots in the United
States, we should note that the existing practice of protection
of citizens' rights when taking land plots for public needs
(Kelo case) leads to a number of critical comments (particu-
larly because the land plots taken after review of the case of
Kelo v. City of New London were not developed by the com-
pany that initiated these proceedings).
In this regard, the Russian ban on withdrawal of land plots
for public needs associated with the economic development of
municipalities appears to be a progressive phenomenon.
Conclusion
Recognition of private ownership rights as "sacred and inviola-
ble" has played a positive role in history; however, the current
model of guaranteed rights of private property owners does not
exclude involuntary withdrawal of such property for the needs
of the state and society.After the analysis of the current Russian
legislation, the scientific doctrine, and the juridical practice of
withdrawal of land from the owners by redemption, we
Anisimov and Ryzhenkov 11
conclude that in addition to public (state and municipal) needs,
objectively, there are public­private needs aimed at the pursuit
of interests not of the whole society but of a certain portion (e.g.,
sports fans, for construction of an Olympic stadium). At the
same time, at the scientific doctrine and juridical practice levels
as well as in the mass public consciousness, many government
acts regarding withdrawal of land plots from owners are per-
ceived as unjust, which leads to negative social consequences.
There are a number of modes to solve the problems that
exist in this field, which are far beyond law itself. In their
economic component, it is necessary to enhance the purchase
price calculation formula; in the legal component, both to
change federal legislation and to expand the rights and
authorities of the federation's constituent entities to settle the
issues of acquisition and termination of ownership rights
considering local conditions and traditions. In a philosophi-
cal regard, it is necessary to continue studying the world out-
look of the population and its responses to decisions of the
government that affect the rights of the land plot owners.
Our main conclusion regards the necessity of developing
a value-conscious approach to the legal aspects of the termi-
nation of owners' rights in regarding the withdrawal of their
land plots for public or public­private needs.
