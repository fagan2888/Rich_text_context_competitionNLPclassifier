Abstract
Background: C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of sub-clinical inflammation, is a predictor of
future cardiovascular diseases. Dietary habits affect serum CRP level however the relationship
between consumption of individual food groups and CRP levels has not been established.
Methods: This study was designed to explore the relation between food intake and CRP levels in
children using data from the cross-sectional 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys. CRP level was classified as low, average or high (<1.0, 1.0-3.0, and >3.0 mg/L, respectively).
Adjusted mean daily intakes of dairy, grains, fruit, vegetables, and meat/other proteins in each CRP
category were estimated using multivariate analysis of covariance modeling. The effect modification
by age (5-11 years vs. 12-16 years), gender and race/ethnicity was explored. We examined whether
total or central body fat (using BMI Z-scores and waist circumference) explained any of the
observed associations.
Results: A total of 4,010 children and adolescents had complete information on diet, CRP and all
covariates of interest and were included in the analyses. Individuals with high CRP levels had
significantly lower intake of grains (p < 0.001) and vegetables (p = 0.0002). Selected individual food
subgroups (e.g., fluid milk and "citrus, melon and berry" consumption) were more strongly
associated with lower CRP than were their respective major food groups. Consumption of meat/
other proteins did not influence CRP levels. The addition of body composition variables to the
models attenuated the results for all food groups to varying degrees.
Conclusion: Children and adolescents with higher CRP levels had significantly lower intakes of
grains and vegetables. The associations between selected childhood dietary patterns and CRP levels
seem largely mediated through effects on body composition.
Background
C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein, is a non
specific biomarker of inflammation produced by the liver
in response to various inflammatory conditions [1]. The
synthesis of CRP is regulated by cytokines, for the most
part Interleukin-6 (IL-6) [2]. The development of highly
sensitive CRP assays (hs-CRP) has enabled the identifica-
tion of more subtle elevations in CRP that may predict the
increased risk of atherogenic cardiovascular diseases
(CVD)[3,4] with better specificity than traditional risk fac-

tors such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lev-
els[4].
Sub-clinical inflammation, as measured by CRP, has been
independently associated with fasting insulin levels in
overweight children and adolescents [5]. Thus these
inflammatory markers may be important early predictors
of adult chronic disease risk and may be pro-atherogenic
even at that early stage of life [6].
A number of studies have analyzed the relationship
between dietary factors and CRP in adults. For example,
higher intakes of grains, fruits and vegetables [7,8] in
adults have been associated with lower CRP levels. Simi-
larly, those following or adopting a Mediterranean-style
diet [9,10] had reduced levels of inflammation. Among
children, there are few data on the effects of diet on
inflammatory markers although dietary fat (but not con-
sumption of milk and meat) was positively associated
with CRP levels in 6-14 year-old children[11]. One inter-
vention that combined activity and a diet rich in unre-
fined carbohydrates, fiber (from grains, fruits and
vegetables), protein-based foods and low-fat dairy prod-
ucts led to a lowering of CRP levels in obese children[12].
The goal of this study is to evaluate the association
between the intake of foods in each of the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) major Food Pyramid
serving groups[13] and serum CRP levels in children (ages
5-16 years). Data from the cross-sectional 1999-2002
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) will be used to address this question.
Methods
Study population
The NHANES are cross-sectional population-based sur-
veys conducted by National Center for Health Statistics
for the purpose of assessing the health and nutritional sta-
tus of U.S. adults and children[14,15]. The survey samples
are selected using a stratified multistage probability
design with random sampling of the civilian non-institu-
tionalized population, with over-sampling of certain sub-
groups. Our analyses were conducted with the approval of
our Institutional Review Board.
Of the 21,004 individuals who participated in 1999-2002
surveys, we included 5,857 children and adolescents, ages
5 to 16 years. Adolescents' ages 17 years and older were
not included in the study since dietary habits during this
early post-high school period are often unstable due to
significant lifestyle changes [16,17]. We excluded 539
subjects with missing or unreliable dietary data as well as
204 individuals with extreme energy intake (upper and
lower 2% of the distribution). We further excluded sub-
jects meeting any of the following criteria: missing CRP
data (n = 590), pregnant or breastfeeding (n = 15), on
dialysis or taking oral medications or insulin for diabetes
(n = 11), missing data on covariates (n = 204), and those
not able to be classified into one of primary racial groups
(n = 107). Finally, to eliminate illness as a possible cause
of elevated CRP, we excluded 77 subjects (mean CRP =
7.02 mg/L) whose white blood cell count was above the
age- and sex-specific upper limit of normal as specified in
the NHANES laboratory manuals[18]. The final study
population included 4,110 children and adolescents.
Assessment of food group intakes
From 1999 to 2001 dietary intake was assessed in
NHANES with a single, multipass 24-hour recall, carried
out using a computer-assisted dietary interview system
that has been previously described[19]. A revised five step
automated multiple-pass instrument was used starting in
2002[20]. Participants aged 12 years and older completed
the interview independently. A proxy respondent
responded for five-year olds while children ages 6 to11
years completed the interview together with a proxy
respondent.
The dietary recalls were analyzed by the USDA using nutri-
ent files that were appropriate to the time period of data
collection[21,22]. Food Pyramid servings were estimated
for each subject as defined by the USDA's Dietary Guide-
lines[23] (see additional file 1).
Measurement of Highly Sensitive CRP (hs-CRP)
Blood samples were collected from all subjects, stored at -
20 degrees centigrade and then shipped to the University
of Washington Medical Center for analysis. The CRP con-
centration in serum was measured by a high-sensitivity
assay, latex enhanced nephelometry, on a Dade Behring
Nephelometer II Analyzer System. The analytical perform-
ance of this test has been validated[24] and shown to be
comparable to that of ELISA[25].
Potential confounders and modifiers of effect
We considered the following potential confounding vari-
ables in our analysis: exact age, race/ethnicity, height (in
meters), height-for-age Z-Scores (HAZ), socioeconomic
status (SES), body mass index (BMI) and BMI-Z Scores,
waist circumference, sedentary behavior (hours of TV
watching and video and computer time per day), energy
intake (in kilo calories), percentage (%) of calories from
carbohydrates, protein and fat and fiber intake per 1000
kilocalories of energy.
Racial/ethnic origin was classified into three categories:
non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics
(i.e., Mexican-Americans). SES was estimated using com-
bined data on income and food insecurity. Weight was
measured on a Toledo Digital Scale and standing height

(to the nearest 0.1 centimeter) using a fixed stadiometer.
Waist circumference was measured with a steel tape (to
the nearest 0.1 centimeter) at the high point of iliac crest
at the end of normal expiration[26]. BMI was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by the square of height, in
meters. CDC growth charts were used to calculate age and
sex-specific BMI Z-scores and height-for-age Z-scores
using the Lambda, Mu, Sigma (LMS) method[27].
Statistical analysis
The goal of the analysis was to evaluate the association
between serum CRP levels at 5 to16 years of age and die-
tary intake in the USDA food pyramid groups. Since
NHANES provides only a single 24-hour dietary recall and
single recalls may provide reliable estimates of population
group means rather than individual means, we chose to
estimate the adjusted food group means according to the
child's CRP group assignment[28]. CRP was classified into
one of three categories that have been previously shown
to reflect low, average and high risk of future CVD[29]:
<1.0 mg/L, 1.0-3.0 mg/L and >3.0 mg/L, respectively.
Adjusted mean intakes of dairy, grains, fruit, vegetables
and meat/other proteins were estimated in each of these
categories using analysis of covariance modeling with
Proc GLM.
All analyses were carried out using SAS, Version 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). We used Proc Surveyreg to calculate
adjusted mean differences in food group intake by CRP
levels accounting for stratification and clustering within
primary sampling units. Since we adjusted for the covari-
ates representing the over-sampled subgroups, we did not
adjust for sampling weights in our analysis; this adjust-
ment is regarded as a good compromise between effi-
ciency and bias[30]. The results of the Surveyreg
Procedure were almost identical to the simpler GLM mod-
eling, leading us to retain the GLM modeling in the results
of this manuscript.
Results
The characteristics of the study population in each of the
three categories of CRP are summarized in Table 1. There
were no meaningful differences in age or sedentary behav-
ior across categories of CRP. The BMI (p < 0.0001), BMI Z-
score (p < 0.0001) and waist circumference (p < 0.0001)
increased with higher CRP levels. Children with low CRP
levels were slightly shorter than those with higher levels.
Non-Hispanic whites were most likely to be in the lowest
CRP group while Hispanics were most likely to fall into
the highest CRP category.
CRP levels were inversely associated with energy intake (p
< 0.0001); those in highest CRP group reported consum-
ing the fewest calories. To address the concern of biased
reporting of energy intake, we also examined the associa-
tion between energy intake and BMI. We found that those
in the highest tertile of BMI consumed fewer calories
(2014.2 kcal) than those in middle (2079.3 kcal) and
lower (2112.0 kcal) tertiles (data not shown).
The adjusted mean food group intakes in the three catego-
ries of CRP are shown in Table 2. After adjusting for age,
gender, race/ethnicity, height, SES, and sedentary behav-
ior, children in the lowest CRP category consumed more
grains (p < 0.001), vegetables (p = 0.0002) and dairy (p =
0.047). We also explored controlling for the height-for-
age Z-scores and found nearly identical results, leading us
to retain the original height variable in the models (see
additional file 2).
Effect modification was assessed using a product term in
the multivariable models. The only statistically significant
interactions were found between age and CRP levels (for
grain intake) (p = 0.03) and for race/ethnicity and CRP
levels for meat intake (p = 0.02). In that model, there was
an inverse association between CRP and meat intake
among Hispanics (p = 0.021) but no association was
observed among Non-Hispanic whites (p = 0.617) and
Non-Hispanic blacks (p = 0.792) (see additional file 3).
Exploring role of body composition and other dietary
factors
The weak but beneficial association between CRP level
and dairy consumption in the baseline analysis was atten-
uated by controlling for either BMI Z-score (p for linear
trend changed from p = 0.047 to p = 0.304) or waist cir-
cumference (changed from p = 0.047 to p = 0.770). There
was only a small amount of attenuation of the associa-
tions of grains and vegetables with CRP level. In the final
analysis in this table, all other food groups were added to
the baseline multivariable models. In this analysis, only
an independent association remained for grains and veg-
etables with CRP. In contrast, the inclusion of energy-
adjusted macronutrients and fiber to the models did not
fully attenuate the observed associations between any of
the food groups and CRP in these children.
The associations of food subgroups and CRP levels are
shown in Table 3. A number of the food subgroups here
are consumed infrequently by these children and adoles-
cents (e.g., yogurt, whole grains, dark green/leafy vegeta-
bles, deep yellow/orange vegetables), giving us little
statistical power to examine their relationship with CRP.
The milk subgroup was inversely associated with CRP (p
= 0.040) while cheese consumption was not. Refined
grain intake appeared to be beneficially associated with
CRP (p < 0.0001). Other food subgroups found to be ben-
eficially related to CRP level included citrus, melons, and
berries (p = 0.053), tomatoes (p = 0.001), total non-
starchy vegetables (p = 0.004), and total starchy vegeta-

bles (p = 0.012). Neither total meat nor any of the meat/
other protein subgroups were associated with CRP levels.
Discussion
This study found that children and adolescents with
higher CRP levels had significantly lower intakes of grains
and vegetables. There was also a weak beneficial associa-
tion between dairy intake and CRP level, particularly for
milk consumption. The low intakes of a number of food
subgroups made it difficult to assess the associations of
these dietary factors with CRP. Certain subgroups such as
tomatoes and citrus, melon and berries were found to be
beneficially associated with CRP. Both starchy and non-
starchy vegetables had similar associations with CRP.
In general, the addition of body composition variables to
the multivariable models attenuated the associations
between food consumption pattern and CRP levels. Only
the intakes of grains and vegetables were independent of
BMI and waist circumference. The mechanism by which
different foods may affect the sub-clinical inflammatory
state is not clear although these results do suggest that
body composition plays a role.
Obesity is a potent risk factor for the development of
atherosclerosis as well as non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus and these effects may be due in part to the sub-
clinical inflammatory response associated with excess adi-
pose tissue[31]. It has been reported that adipose tissue
secrete cytokines such as IL-6 that in turn regulate CRP
production[32]. Both obesity and inflammation are
related in a circular fashion. Excessive weight gain stimu-
lates an inflammatory response while inflammation itself
leads to greater weight gain[33]. Recent published studies
in children indicate that excess adiposity is associated
with significantly higher levels of CRP[34,35] and several
other studies suggest that high CRP levels may lead to
early atherosclerotic changes in children[36].
The association between fruit and vegetable consumption
and CRP in this study is consistent with some earlier stud-
ies of adults. Higher intakes of citrus, melon, berries or
tomatoes may be linked with healthier lifestyles in general
and with beneficial effects on body fat acquisition. Fruits
and vegetables are low-energy dense foods (fewer calories
per gram of food) with high contents of water and fiber.
The larger volume of food consumed combined with the
low energy density may benefit satiety[37], energy balance
and weight status[38]. While controlling for body compo-
sition in our analyses attenuated the effects of fruit intake,
the association between vegetable consumption and CRP
was unchanged, suggesting that the effects of vegetables in
this study was not entirely explained by differences in
body composition.
Some food groups such as vegetables and fruits are partic-
ularly rich in antioxidant compounds including vitamin
C[39], beta carotene[40], dietary flavonoids[41], and lyc-
opene[42]. These anti-oxidants may lower the concentra-
tion of CRP, thereby reducing sub-clinical inflammation.
In one study, the total antioxidant capacity of the diet was
shown to be independently associated with lower CRP
levels, leading the authors to suggest that this mechanism
might be part of the explanation for the beneficial effects
of certain dietary factors such as fruits, whole cereals and
red wine on the risk of CVD [43]. In addition, low levels
of antioxidant vitamin intake have also been associated
with obesity in children[44].
Unlike vegetables, the association between CRP levels and
dairy consumption in this study was attenuated by the
inclusion of either BMI or waist circumference in the mul-
tivariable models. Thus, it is possible that the association
between dairy and CRP is explained by previously shown
beneficial effects of dairy intake on body composi-
tion[45]. Dairy intake may also be linked with greater sati-
ety or a healthier diet in general. In a recent study in mice,
a diet rich in dairy led to decreases in the expression of
several inflammatory cytokine genes in adipose tissue[46]
which was in turn followed by decreases in the levels of
plasma IL-6 and its associated inflammatory marker CRP.
The inverse association between CRP and grain intake was
not explained by differences in body composition. Nei-
ther body composition nor the intake of macronutrients
or other foods explained the relation between CRP and
refined grains. The CRP-grain association in this study is
consistent with findings among adults in NHANES-III[47]
but not consistent with effects found in other studies[48].
In one recent study of adults on a hypo-caloric diet, the
intake of both whole and refined grains was associated
with moderate weight loss but only whole grain con-
sumption led to reductions in CRP levels[49].
There are several limitations of this study, the most impor-
tant of which is its cross-sectional design. Certainly, it is
very unlikely that the reported dietary intake in this study
is biased by knowledge of CRP level. However, it is possi-
ble that the reported dietary intakes are biased by the level
of body fat which is closely linked with CRP. This bias is
more likely present among adolescents than among
younger children.
A second important limitation of this study is the availa-
bility of only a single 24 hour dietary recall, thereby pro-
viding a less precise measure of intake. The use of a single
recall does not introduce bias but will reduce the power to
detect true effects that may exist, especially in population
subgroups (e.g., stratifying by race/ethnicity) and for
infrequently-eaten foods. To minimize error associated

with using a single 24-hour recall to classify children
according to dietary intake, we classified the children
according to CRP level and examined mean dietary
intakes in these groups[28].
We were unable to exclude certain chronic diseases or
prevalent acute infections in the children. However, we
did exclude those subjects whose white blood cell count
was above the upper limit of the reference range from the
NHANES laboratory procedural manual. Another limita-
tion of this analysis is that we were unable to control for
physical activity since these data were not collected for
children at ages 5-11 years of age. While the association
between physical activity and CRP levels during child-
hood is uncertain[50], we attempted to address this
potential confounding issue by including a measure of
sedentary behavior in the multivariable models.
There are certain strengths of this study that we would like
to mention. NHANES is a comprehensive national survey
with a large sample size (and over-sampling of minori-
ties), making the results more generalizable to US popula-
tion. To our knowledge this is the first study to examine
the effects of USDA food group intakes on CRP levels in
children, while examining the role of number of potential
modifiers of this relationship.
Conclusion
In conclusion, in this cross-sectional study, higher levels
of CRP were associated with lower intakes of vegetables
and grains and, to a lesser degree, lower intakes of dairy.
Only the associations seen with grains and vegetable
intakes were independent of body composition. Higher
intakes of certain food subgroups, such as milk, citrus,
melons and berries, and tomatoes were also associated
with lower levels of CRP. These dietary relationships with
CRP should be further examined in future prospective
studies.
