Introduction
Emerging evidence suggests that acquired brain injury
supplants infectious diseases and reproductive, maternal,
and child health as a leading cause of global mortality, and
accounts for a considerable degree of disability and eco-
nomic loss (Al-Adawi et al., 2004; Hyder, Wunderlich,
Puvanachandra, Gururaj, & Kobusingye, 2007; Lopez,
Mathers, Ezzati, Jamison, & Murray, 2006). In some less
developed countries (LDCs), on one hand, care for people
with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is either nonexistent or still
at a rudimentary stage of development (Al-Naamani &
Al-Adawi, 2007). On the other hand, with the advent of
effective emergency care and acute medical care, deaths
from TBI have decreased, but TBI survivors are left with
irreversible, intransigent, and debilitating loss of physical,
cognitive, and psychosocial functioning (Al-Adawi et al.,
2007). In LDCs, as the burden of care is limited to the family
circle, the consequences of the injury not only affect the
victim but also that person's entire social network. Similar
trends appear to exist even in developed Western countries
(Simpson, Mohr, & Redman, 2000) where it has been dem-
onstrated that the role of the family has a significant impact
on the rehabilitative process and its functional prognosis
(Kreutzer et al., 2009; Saltapidas & Ponsford, 2008,
Schönberger, Ponsford, Olver, & Ponsford, 2010). There is
evidence to suggest that social support is critically important
in determining the level of adjustment of the patient/family
to the situation (Ergh, Hanks, Rapport, & Coleman, 2003;
Gan, Gargaro, Brandys, Gerber, & Boschen, 2010; Janda
et al., 2008; Ponsford & Schönberger, 2010). Various
authors have outlined different and diverse caregiver coping
processes in Western countries for patients with neurobe-
havioral impairments. Clinically, significant levels of psy-
chological distress that mimic symptoms of depression and
anxiety as well as a preoccupation with prolonged and
unremitting denial, hysteria, and anger are common occur-
rences (Al-Adawi et al., 2005; Anderson et al., 2009;
Machamer, Temkin, & Dikmen, 2002; Ponsford, Olver,
Ponsford, & Nelms, 2003). This has lead to the development
of support services to alleviate the burden of care on relatives
(Ponsford et al., 2003).

Abstract
Little is known about primary caregivers' perceptions of a relative who has sustained abruptly personality changes following
traumatic brain injury (TBI) in non-Western populations.To help appreciate the diversity of perceptions of disability outside
the biomedical setting, the present discourse highlights how primary caregivers construct sequelae of TBI in Oman. A
qualitative case study with an ethnographic approach was conducted using semistructured interviews. Six caregivers from
two families of patients with TBI were interviewed to garner description of lay beliefs within a rural community in Oman
related to the experience of family carers with a relative suffering from a brain injury. The caregivers interpreted their
relatives' predicament through the local idiom of distress involving belief in spirit infestation and ensorcellment.The present
qualitative study supports the view that when a family member incurs neurobehavioral impairments, the coping processes
of the caregivers are heavily influenced by cultural concepts of health and illness. Such attributions are discussed in terms of
specific sociocultural forces within Omani society.

There is a dearth of studies examining how families out-
side Euro-American populations construct the sequelae of
neurobehavioral impairment. In collectivistic societies,
such as those often found in many LDCs, cultural pattern-
ing means that difficulties and illnesses are viewed as a
challenge to the extended family and the community. One
of the central tenets of a collectivistic society is to attempt
to reconstruct the patient's identity by calling the whole
community to witness and share the misfortune of the dis-
tressed. This process helps to increase the patient's self-
value and reinforce the patient's relationship with the
community (Al-Adawi, 1993). The importance of the fam-
ily in the care of relatives has been shown to overcome poor
prognostic indicators when the community responds to the
initial episode of illness by sympathetic acceptance, benev-
olently protective attention, and assistance in a culturally
prescribed way. According to Kleinman (1988), cultures,
in making sense of illness, have clusters of explanatory
models, the lenses through which cultures perceive and under-
stand illness. Such perceptions have not, to our knowledge,
been reported in the context of acquired brain injury in tradi-
tional societies around the world. This contrasts with the vast
literature that has emerged on the perceptions of psychiatric
illness (Lewis-Fernandez & Kleinman, 1995).
Anthropological studies have suggested that a person's
behavior or personality can be controlled or possessed by
spirit in many traditional communities (Al-Adawi, Martin,
Al-Salmi, & Ghassani, 2001; Cohen & Barrett, 2008).
Spirits are invisible forces believed to inhabit the earth and
influence mankind by appearing in the form of humans or
animals. In such communities, supernatural forces such as
Jinn, contemptuous envy (Hassad), the envy-related "eye"
(Ain), and sorcery (Sihr) appear to be central to the idiom of
distress (Al-Sinawi, Al-Adawi, & Al-Guenedi, 2008) or
"explanatory models" (Kleinman, 1988). It has yet to be
reported whether such an idiom of distress is also found
among families of patients with acquired brain injury marked
with neurobehavioral impairment. Exploring families' per-
ceptions of their relatives'distress could help to shed light on
what is universal versus what is cultural in coping with such
a misfortune. It could also lay the foundation for future qual-
itative and quantitative cultural studies on cultural variations
in the understanding of coping and adaptation mechanisms
of caregivers of injured relatives. Understanding the breadth
and depth of how primary caregivers cope with the neuro-
logical impairment of their relatives would, in addition, shed
light on how disability is conceptualized.
To our knowledge, there is no empirical research on the
response of caregivers from Arab/Islamic countries to a
family member who incurs neurological and medical com-
plications resulting in intransigent cognitive, emotional, and
behavioral impairments. The aim of this study is to describe
the reactions and adaptation of caregivers in Oman, a coun-
try in which the family is still expected to play an important
role in social organization using in-depth interviews with
three carers of victim or survivor of brain injury.
Oman lies on the eastern side of the Arabian Peninsula,
and with a population of nearly 3 million, there were 25
deaths per 100,000 inhabitants due to accidents and injuries
(mostly from road traffic accidents) compared with the
world rate of 19 per 100,000 (Al-Naamani & Al-Adawi,
2007). In addition to mortality, each year 0.3% to 0.4% of
the population in Oman is estimated to incur disability that
is precipitated by unintentional injuries and road traffic
accidents (Al-Naamani & Al-Adawi, 2007). Victims often
seek acute medical management, but thereafter only limited
rehabilitation services are available to survivors of brain
injury.
Method and Context of the Study
To capture the experiences of the caregivers of people with
disability due to brain Injury in Oman, a qualitative approach
was employed to obtain a variety of subjective and sponta-
neous accounts of caregivers' conceptions of the predica-
ment of their brain-injured relative. The families were
periodically interviewed to see how their perceptions of their
relative changed over time.
The present qualitative study constitutes an extension of a
previous study (Al-Adawi et al., 2007) and follows research
methodology described elsewhere (Profanter, 2009). In brief,
a qualitative case study approach using in-depth interviews
with carers was employed. This has the net benefit of provid-
ing an opportunity to study the phenomenon of interest to
gain insight into the beliefs and attributions of caregivers of
survivors of brain injury. The value in stories about particu-
lar people in a specific context is especially useful in Oman
where there is a limited research on such discourse. Such
undertaking may shed light on intricate mechanism of cer-
tain behaviors and this, in turn, could illuminate on the over-
all phenomenon that is specific to certain cultural group
(Stake, 1995). Such an approach, at face value, being idio-
graphic focus, may appear to impinge required rigorous
research methodology but nevertheless lay groundwork
quantitative study.
For the present contest, the employed depth interviews
followed a discussion-type approach where the informants
were asked to respond to a variety of open-ended questions
related to themes drawn from the literature (Dejmana et al.,
2010; Ekblad & Bäärnhielm, 2002; Kleinman, 2004). The
common denominators of such themes are cultural attribu-
tions to abrupt personality that entail irrevocable loss of
"persona" of their loved one. Three male family members
were interviewed from each family: the father and two broth-
ers. It was taken into consideration that information gather-
ing had to be open ended; this is often viewed as an integral
part of qualitative studies (Barbour & Kitzinger, 1999). The
main areas covered were (a) conceptualization (What is your
relative's predicament called?), (b) cause (What do you think
caused his problem?), (c) impact (How does his illness affect
him and the family?), (d) help-seeking (What kind of treat-
ment did he obtain and why?), and (e) desired treatment
Al-Adawi et al. 3
outcome (What is the most important outcome you hope the
treatment will provide?).
The researcher took detailed notes during the interview,
noting long pauses and nonverbal communications when
these were thought to be important. The notes were written
up immediately after the interview. During subsequent inter-
views, the areas of inquiry were revisited and new ideas
noted. Analysis was done concurrently with data collection
and iteratively directed data collection on further follow-up
interviews as described elsewhere (Watkins, 2010). The data
were analyzed using the "interpretive phenomenological
approach" described by Smith, Harre, and Van Langenhove
(2001) and Larkin, Watts, and Clifton (2006). The transcripts
were read several times. Interesting and recurring ideas were
marked in addition to striking words and sentences.
For this study, there were two sessions of peer review con-
ducted during the stage of analysis. Each peer review session
included both the authors. The peer review meetings sup-
ported the results of the analysis, and there was a great level
of agreement between the researchers. The three main themes
that emerged from the interviews and will be entertained in
the ensuing paragraphs are labeled as (a) causal attributions
and cultural beliefs, (b) attributions and coping (c) coping
and the health care services.
The interviews were conducted by one of the authors
(Samir Al-Adawi [SA]). Each informant was interviewed 5
times over a period of 1 year, and all interviews took place
at the informants' home. Before starting the interviews, the
aims, procedures, and duration of the research were
explained to the interviewees. They were assured that there
was no right or wrong answer rather that their ideas, views,
and experiences were important contributions to the study.
Ethical permission for the study was granted by local
Institutional Review Board.
Results
The interview data are presented as narrative stories of the
patients, from the perspectives of the caregivers, aiming to
highlight the cultural beliefs and attributions of caregivers.
This will shed light on the way caregivers view their family
member's illness. For brevity, and as the interviews were
very long, the case studies are summarized keeping in mind
the temporal element of the story.
Case Study 1:The Possessed
BB is a 36-year-old Omani man who was rendered uncon-
scious after falling from a date tree in a rural region of
Oman. The family rushed the survivor to the nearest primary
health clinic where he regained consciousness on arrival.
According to the family, physical examination at the time
was unremarkable except for minor skin abrasions. He was
discharged home without any further intervention.
Subsequently, BB complained of headaches and diffused
pain, which was alleviated with simple analgesics. In addi-
tion, the family noted that BB's personality had changed.
According to them, BB had "lost himself." He was described
by the family, in biomedical parlance, as emotionally labile,
erratic, and impulsive. The term that encapsulates his con-
duct is that equated with adolescence, murahaqa, meaning
an unmarried person who has reached puberty and is charac-
terized by high emotionality, impulsivity and a heightened
preoccupation with sexual temptation (Al-Adawi, 2006).
Concerned with BB's behavior, the family sought medical
attention. The physician recommended that the family seek
a psychiatric opinion in the university hospital. This would
have required them to travel to an urban area, which the
primary caregivers were reluctant to do as they did not think
that BB suffered from psychiatric illness, a condition either
stigmatized or attributed to supernatural causes and in the
latter case often considered the prerogative of traditional
healers in the rural community. In the family circle, BB's
personality change was attributed to various causal agents,
including supernatural forces such as Jinn.
The family consulted a traditional healer who "revealed"
to the family that BB had been a "victim" of jealousy or the
"evil eye." The traditional healer's "diagnosis" confirmed
the family suspicion that it had been a magic spell rather than
an unfortunate accident that had caused BB to fall and his
personality to change. To the family, this seemed more rea-
sonable because BB had been climbing trees all his life and
had never fallen before. The fact that he was a successful
farmer further raised the family's suspicion. The traditional
healer prescribed an amulet for BB to wear and a potion to be
drunk at regular intervals created from water washed over
selected Koranic verses hand written in charcoal on a wooden
surface. Even after this "treatment," BB's erratic behavior
continued. His conduct bewildered and distressed his wife
who on several occasions contemplated leaving him and
returning to her own family. The wife complained that he
was not acting as responsible father any more. He was also
noted to be disinhibited. With no apparent sign of recovery,
BB was taken to another traditional healer. This healer also
concluded that BB had been harmed by evil eyes because he
was a successful man in the village and therefore likely to be
the subject of jealousy. The healer treated him with various
esoteric verses to ward off evil forces. The relatives, includ-
ing the wife, thought this resulted in a temporary remission
of his "abnormal" behavior.
After 2 months, the family consulted another traditional
healer who was known for his "power" to tame the Jinn, or
spirits, and conduct exorcisms. This shamanic healer attrib-
uted BB's behavior to spirit possession by a Jinn. A cere-
mony was subsequently organized to exorcise the possessing
spirit. The purpose of the ceremony was to coerce the
"invading spirit" to reveal why it had chosen to possess BB.
During the ceremony, the healer used his own spirit to
4 SAGE Open
possess BB and then used his own spirit to lure the unknown
spirit out of BB. The healer tried to ascertain the Jinn's iden-
tity by first questioning BB in vulgar Arabic and then using
a peculiar language known only to the Jinn. When this
failed, the healer flogged BB, believing he was actually
flogging the Jinn. The healer also tried to provoke the Jinn
to emerge using pleasantries, promises, toughness, and
threats. After these attempts failed, the healer attributed
BB's difficulties to other supernatural forces and magic.
Despite the failure of the "treatment," BB was said to have
improved. Almost 1 year after the accident, the family no
longer attributed BB's behavior to Jinn. Rather, they
believed that he had once been possessed, but he was slowly
"clearing" it. The family accepted the idea that BB would
remain a "changed" man. However, they strongly hoped
that God would punish whoever had placed the spell on BB,
and the family decided that BB's presence was a test by God
for them to remain strong in the face of adversity. When last
seen, BB was still impulsive, but it seems that the family has
learnt to accommodate his new sense of self.
Case Study 2:The "Mu ghayeb"
MM is 28-year-old and a father of six children with an unre-
markable medical history until he sustained a TBI following
a road traffic accident. He was living in extended family in a
rural part of Oman. He never acquired formal education
although he had cursory knowledge of Koran. He lost con-
sciousness after the accident and was admitted to hospital.
MM was left with intransigent impairments suggestive of a
vegetative state. The family was told that MM would be
likely to remain dependent on them for his basic care and
might never regain his premorbid personality and competen-
cies. As there is no rehabilitation of such cases in the country,
the attending doctor advised the family to seek rehabilitation
outside of Oman. Such services are only available in Western
Europe and North America, and it was not financially viable
for this particular family to undertake such an intervention.
Although the family of MM appears to have understood
that a persistent vegetative state could follow a TBI, the
family believed instead that the real MM had been "stolen,"
and he became a Mu ghayeb, a phenomenon akin to zombi-
fication that has been reported from Haiti with minor differ-
ences. Although most villagers had heard of someone who
had returned to his family after being stolen, no one had
firsthand knowledge of such an existence. In contrast, zom-
bies are often seen in the neighborhood in Haiti (Littlewood
& Douyon, 1997). The family felt that a magician had
placed a spell on MM, converting him into a person lacking
free will, soul, or awareness such as zombie. The family
believed that the Mu ghayeb MM was living a shadowy
existence, sleeping naked in a cave during the day, and ris-
ing at night to wander about the countryside, feeding on
leaves, and doing whatever the magician ordered. The family
claimed to have seen the Mu ghayeb MM as a wraith-like
figure at night approaching the house in disguise as a stray
dog. At other times, the family claimed to have felt him
"intuitively present in the house."
The family believed that the Mu ghayeb MM could be
returned back to them in one of three ways. First, the magi-
cian might be discovered and killed or destroyed in some
other way (which could include the magician's natural
death). When a magician dies, all the people he has enthralled
are freed and will return to their families. Another way to
free the enthralled is to find the zombied person wandering
and overpower him by hitting him on the forehead with a
stone. Again, this would automatically release him from his
bewitchment. The final method is to seek a healer to counter-
act the magician's spell.
The family invited a White magician healer to help free
their "enthralled" loved one; however, the juju (charm) was
unsuccessful. MM remained in a vegetative state, and several
months later without any observable change in his function-
ing, MM passed away in his sleep. The death further rein-
forced the belief that he had been stolen, even after an elaborate
burial ritual and the prescribed period of mourning.
Discussion
Despite the increased morbidity due to road traffic accidents
and unintentional injuries globally (Peden, McGee, & Krug,
2002), very little has been documented on how primary
caregivers of injured relatives cope with this disability.
Brain injury imposes a large emotional and psychological
burden on primary caregivers of injured relatives regardless
of their sociocultural background (Cavallo & Saucedo,
1995). In Western populations, the family members who are
responsible for their injured relative's care tend to be in an
"emotional paradox" when the life of a previously healthy
individual is irrevocably altered (Tzidkiahu, Sazbon, &
Solzi, 1994). According to Niemeier and Burnett (2001),
while the disabled may not even realize that anything has
happened to him or her, the family may go through the bur-
den and distress of "burying" the person they previously
knew and trying to develop a relationship with a new and
less affable stranger. To our knowledge, no study has
reported how primary caregivers of the injured relative cope
with neurobehavioral impairment in the Arab world.
Theme 1: Causal Attributions and Cultural Beliefs
As the above case studies suggest, traditional beliefs on
causative factors of the injury are reached for and healing
practices and rituals performed. The prevailing tendency
among Omanis is to explain the change in their relative by
the existence of sensate agents who have cast a spell on the
victim rather than thinking that the TBI has transformed
their loved one. Thus, the accident and its sequelae are
ascribed to spirit infestation or ensorcellment (Al-Adawi,
Burjorjee, & Al-Issa, 1997). These beliefs are consistent
Al-Adawi et al. 5
with how distress is experienced in this culture. In traditional
Omani society, illness, stress, and distress are attributed to
natural factors, supernatural influences, or a combination of
the two (Al-Adawi, 1993, Al-Busaidi, 2010). Although the
accident sustained in these two cases might appear to be
"naturally" caused, the family believed that the accident was
the result of the active, vengeful intervention of anthropo-
morphic beings conjured up by a malicious and envious
person. Someone was jealous of the alleged success of these
two people, and thus, they became the victims of aggression
and punishment. In Euro-American psychology, such an
explanatory model is indicative of an "external locus of con-
trol." Individuals with an external locus of control believe
that events are determined by outside forces in contrast to
the biomedical model where the emphasis is on the interplay
between biology and socialization. Thus, caregivers in
Oman attribute neurobehavioral impairment to external fac-
tors. In the present example from Oman, the external locus
of control manifested as a belief in spirit infestation and
ensorcellment. This is consistent with the view in Oman that
misadventures are likely to be perceived as originating from
external forces or due to person­society disjunctions. If such
views were substantiated after further scrutiny, it could be
concluded that the major socializing force, Islam, as prac-
ticed by the common person, is considerably modified by
local folk beliefs (Al-Adawi et al., 1997). This negates the
fallacy of a regional, Muslim personality type and the idea
that life of many Muslims is strongly dictated by Islam.
Challenges of life are foreordained in Islam. Islam means
total submission to God. This implies that attributing the
predicaments of life to other than God's will is to question
His will (Wikan, 1988).
Theme 2:Attributions and Coping
The question remains how adaptive to coping with disability
are these culturally sanctioned beliefs and practices of Omani
caregivers? Studies from different parts of the world suggest
that in many traditional societies, people who are unable to
care for themselves (the disabled, diseased, or mentally ill) are
not seen as "ill," instead they are considered to be possessed
or to have been affected by unnatural events such as evil eyes
or simply be the victim of a magical spell often tied to a social
relationship (Al-Adawi, 1993). As a corollary to this, it has
been suggested that the chronic course of some diseases may
be eased if the sufferer's difficulties are attributed to such
forces as possession as this is likely to create culturally pre-
scribed sympathetic acceptance, attention, and assistance
(Al-Adawi et al., 2002). Contained in the reaction of the care-
givers is the idea of being able to make the lost one return, by
overpowering the magician, exorcising the bad spirit, or find-
ing, seizing, and rescuing the "stolen individual" from captiv-
ity or possession. This shadowy figure of evil thus forms a
focus for the expression and projection of hostile feelings. As
research on stress has shown, when the "reality" becomes a
burden to bear, an angry emotional reaction can be a benefi-
cial coping mechanism (Horowitz, 1979). This may allow the
individual, gradually and perhaps more naturally, to come to
terms with adverse events.
Theme 3: Coping and the Health
Care Services
Could such "exotic" reactions like belief in spirit posses-
sion and bewitchment represent an adaptation to the lack of
essential rehabilitation services for survivors of TBI? In
other words, if proper interventions existed, would the
caregivers have manifested a similar reaction? In a recent
survey of the world health care system, the World Health
Organization ranked Oman as the most "efficient" health
care system in the world in terms of outcome (Jamison &
Sandbu, 2001). This system, as in other low-income coun-
tries, is often geared toward the eradication of infectious
disease and malnutrition, and medical intervention for
accident victims. The latter tends to reducing mortality but
does not provide supportive follow-up care. Thus, survi-
vors of brain injury in Oman are often left without other
support than that of family caregivers. It is possible that if
adequate interventions were available for victims of neu-
robehavioral impairment, this would not only reduce the
impact of disability but would also provide a venue for the
caregivers to be informed about the sequelae and severity
of acquired brain injury.
Studies conducted elsewhere have suggested that patients'
views of pain and suffering are diametrically opposed to the
modern biomedical view (Al-Sinawi & Al-Adawi, 2006). As
an extension of this finding, this study reports how primary
caregivers are coping with disability of injured relatives in
Oman. In Oman, the caregivers attributed the distress of their
loved ones to infestation and ensorcellment. It is worthwhile
to note that for the doctor, the neurobehavioral impairment is
simply an adverse reaction triggered by the accident. The
irreconcilable and opposing views of laypersons and profes-
sionals are likely to hinder these two parties from mutual
agreement on the etiology, treatment, and prognostic indica-
tors of the patients. This may lead to poor medical outcomes
as the patients and the relatives are not likely to adhere to the
treatment plan. This can further diminish patient satisfaction
and negatively affect the quality of the patient's life. These
two examples from Oman illustrate that the caregivers may
not even seek biomedical care because this type of distress is
perceived to the prerogative of traditional healers. As
Ponsford et al. (2003) pointed out, "Agreat deal can be learnt
from the values, attributes and coping styles" (p. 466) of
injured relatives and their families. Understanding how care-
givers deal with their neurologically impaired relative will
have a direct bearing on the doctor­patient relationship, and
on which would be the most cost-effective and culturally
sensitive interventions. The long period of health care spe-
cialist training and the unique acculturation process of the
6 SAGE Open
training all along Western biomedical lines leaves practitio-
ners in non-Western societies disconnected from the very
societies in which they are expected to provide health care
and alienated from the ethical values of their own societies.
This means that many health care providers in developing
countries are incapable of communicating with their
patients whose views on health and illness are incompatible
or incongruent with the biomedical model. As health care
practitioners tend to receive little training in cross-cultural
clinical communication, this creates a communication
disjunction in health care delivery with significant ramifi-
cations on cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Understanding
the traditional conception of illness or distress would help
practitioners communicate effectively with patients and
their families. Recognizing the cultural variations in coping
with neurological impairment would delineate what consti-
tutes adaptive responses for the caregivers and also lead to
culturally sensitive interventions for caregivers such as
providing the right information to help them cope better
with caring for an injured relative.
Limitations
It is essential to highlight some of the obvious limitations of
the present study. Being a qualitative study, the results of
this study cannot be generalized to the whole Omani popu-
lation as the aim was to gather in-depth information.
Alasuutari (1995) recommended that we replace the term
generalization with extrapolation to explain how the study
of one case relates to other cases and to the nature of the
phenomenon. In this way, case studies can help us test the
limits of our existing understanding and allow us to develop
or modify theories to explain occurrences. Nevertheless,
further studies on this topic with a larger sample size and
more robust research methodology would be essential to
increase the generalizability of the findings. The other main
issue with the method remains the use of two case studies
without much contextual data and details, and interviewing
only male family carers. It is possible that women who are
often limited to domestic sphere are likely to be shielded
from intruding eyes of outside; more studies taking onboard
women's potential attitudes or experiences need to be con-
sidered in the future study. On this ground, present informa-
tion that has gender gap may lead to an uncomfortable
suggestion about homogeneity of beliefs and practices
within this rural community in Oman about illness/distress
in general and brain injury in particular.
Conclusion
This article explores the coping strategies of caregivers in
Oman whose loved ones have sustained brain injury result-
ing in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems. In-depth
interviews provided the foundation for understanding their
experiences and suggested that cultural factors, which pro-
duce specific interpretations of the predicament of their
relative, influence their coping behaviors. In this age of
cultural relativism, such a coping mechanism may appear to
border on collective delusion and therefore may be deemed
pathological. In this age of cultural relativism and within
Oman's social-cultural lances, belief in spirit infestation
and ensorcellment appear to be culturally sanctioned adap-
tive responses for coping with difficult situation triggered
by traumatic brain injury.
