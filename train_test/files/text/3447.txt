Introduction
Hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus are associated
with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, mainly due
to atherosclerotic vascular changes.1­4 Endothelial dysfunc-
tion and increased arterial stiffness are considered markers of
subclinical atherosclerosis, and are related to a worse prog-
nosis.5,6 Angiotensin II plays a central role in both condi-
tions,asitpromotesanincreasedformationofoxygen-reactive
species, reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide, vascular cell
apoptosis, matrix deposition, low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol oxidation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.7­9
The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and
the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are the most com-
monly used drugs that limit the effects of angiotensin II.
Albeit most guidelines recommend both classes interchange-
ably,10,11 their mechanisms of action are not the same. ACEi,
but not ARB, lead to increased levels of bradykinin and

Abstract
Introduction: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of benazepril and losartan on endothelial function
and vascular stiffness, in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
Materials and methods: We included hypertensive diabetic patients with an office systolic blood pressure (BP) 
130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP  80 mmHg. Patients were rolled over to amlodipine for 6 weeks, then we performed
C-reactive protein assays, BP measurement and vascular tests; next, patients were randomized to benazepril or losartan.
The tests were repeated after 12 weeks.
Results: We randomized 14 patients to benazepril and 16 to losartan. There were no differences in systolic (139 versus
134 mmHg, p = 0.618) and diastolic (82 versus 80 mmHg, p = 0.950) BP at the end of the study. C-reactive protein
values were lower in the benazepril group (0.38 versus 0.42 mg/dl, p = 0.020). There was a slightly higher flow-mediated
vasodilation (FMD) response in the benazepril group (45% increase, p = 0.057) than in the losartan group (19% increase,
p = 0.132). Both central systolic BP (129 versus 123 mmHg, p = 0.934) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV)
(8.5 versus 8.5 m/s, p = 0.280) were the same between groups.
Conclusions: Hypertensive diabetic patients using benazepril had a greater reduction in C-reactive protein, and a slight
improvement in FMD, than those taking losartan.

angiotensin-(1­7), both with anti-atherogenic and vasodilator
properties.12 Three recent meta-analyses with hypertensive
patients review the effects of ACEi and ARB on endothelial
function,asassessedbyflow-mediatedvasodilation(FMD)13­
15; another meta-analysis reviews their effects on arterial stiff-
ness, as assessed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central
pressure waveforms.Although bothACEi andARB were bet-
ter than placebo, their results were the same, when compared
among themselves; however, all these meta-analyses included
very few trials with diabetic patients.
The primary objective of this study was to compare the
effects of benazepril and losartan, which are an ACEi and
an ARB, respectively, on endothelial function and vascular
stiffness in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and
hypertension.
Materials and methods
Patient selection
Patients were recruited from our outpatient hypertension
clinic. Inclusion criteria were: age between 40­70 years
old, previous diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and
hypertension, and office systolic blood pressure (BP) 
130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP  80 mmHg. We excluded
patients with secondary hypertension, resistant hyper-
tension, insulin therapy, Stage 4 or 5 of chronic renal dis-
ease, previous myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular
accident, history of transient ischemic attack, heart failure
Stage C or D, atrial fibrillation, malignant ventricular
arrhythmias, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease,
retinopathy with visual loss, nephrotic syndrome and
symptomatic neuro-pathy. All patients accepted by written
informed consent. The hospital ethics committee approved
the trial (no. 01539612.6.0000.5259) and it was registered
in `Clinical Trials' under identifier NCT01603940.
Study design
The study was a randomized, open label, clinical trial with
two treatment arms (Figure 1). In Visit 1, all patients were
rolled over for amlodipine 5 mg once a day (q.d.). After 6
weeks (Visit 2), we conducted BP measurements, and tests
to evaluate vascular stiffness and endothelial function.

R Gismondi et al. 969
Venous blood was sampled for the biochemistry and
C-reactive protein (CRP) assays.
Patients with systolic BP  130 mmHg and/or diastolic
BP  80 mmHg were randomized to benazepril 10 mg q.d.
or losartan 50 mg q.d. Patients were randomized by the
method of `randomly permuted blocks'. The randomiza-
tion was not stratified and was done by an independent
investigator. Patients were evaluated at 4-week intervals to
adjust BP (Visit 3 and Visit 4). We titrated the benazepril to
20 mg q.d. and losartan to 100 mg q.d., for those patients
with BP  130/80 mmHg. At Visit 4, hydrochlorothiazide
25 mg q.d. was added, if necessary, to control BP. In
Visit 5 (at 12 weeks) study patients had repeats of the
vascular tests, laboratory assays and BP measurement.
Hypoglycemic drugs dosages were rigorously maintained
throughout the study. We checked adherence each visit, by
tablet counting. We considered patients had good compli-
ance when they had taken more than 80% of expected drug
doses for the study period.
Blood pressure measurement
Office BP was obtained using an electronic device (model
HEM-705CP, Omron Healthcare, Lake Forest, IL, USA)
and an appropriate-sized cuff. Before measurement,
patients were seated for 30 min and refrained from smok-
ing and caffeine ingestion. Three readings were done 1
min apart and the average of these measurements was
defined as the patient BP.
Assays
Fasting venous blood was collected to measure total cho-
lesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose, glycated hemoglobin (by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), creati-
nine (by an enzymatic method) and uric acid. The low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was calculated
by the Friedewald formula. The glomerular filtration rate
was estimated (eGFR) by modified Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation (Equation 1):
eGFR = 175 × Creatinine ­1.154 × Age ­0.203
(× 0.742, if female gender)
We also measured CRP by nephelometry (BN II, Siemens
AG, Munich, Germany), and morning urinary spot albumin
and creatinine by nephelometry (Immage, Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA, USA). The lower detection limit for CRP
was 0.02 mg/dL. Values for microalbuminuria were consid-
ered normal, if up to 30 mg/g creatinine.
Vascular tests
All vascular tests were performed in the morning, in the
supine position, after a minimum of 10 min rest in a quiet,
temperature-controlled room. Patients were requested to
fast; and to abstain from tea, coffee, alcohol and smoking
for 12 h. The study and other morning medication were to
be taken 1­2 hours before measurements. The vascular
equipment operator was blinded to the patients' treatment.
Brachial flow-mediated vasodilation
Imaging studies were performed according to recent guide-
lines.16,17 Endothelial-dependent (flow-mediated) vasodila-
tion was measured using a 10 MHz high-resolution
ultrasound (Vivid 3, General Electric Healthcare,
Milwaukee, WI, USA). Vessel diameters were analyzed on
frozen longitudinal images over the right brachial artery,
2­5 cm above the antecubital fossa. Three measurements
were taken for three cardiac cycles at the end of diastole
(R wave on the electrocardiogram (EKG)), and then the
mean was calculated. Ischemia was induced by inflating
the cuff 50 mmHg above the patient's systolic BP, for 5
min. The maximal vessel diameter was recorded at 30, 60
and 90 seconds after cuff release; and we expressed the
percentage of change over to basal diameter as FMD.
Pulse wave velocity
Pulse waves were obtained using a Complior SP device
(Alam Medical, Vincennes, France), with transducers
placed in the regions of the right carotid artery, right radial
artery (crPWV), and right femoral artery (cfPWV).18 Two
measurements were made: The mean was used for analysis.
When the difference was > 0.5 m/s, a third measurement
was made: That median was then considered for analysis.
Determination of central aortic pressure
Pulse waves of the right radial artery were obtained using an
applanation tonometer (model SPC-301-Millar Instruments,
Houston, TX, USA), calibrated according to the brachial
artery pressure. Pulse wave analysis was performed to obtain
central aortic pressures and other hemodynamic parameters,
using the SphygmoCor system (Atcor Medical, Sydney,
Australia). The system's software calculates the central sys-
tolic BP, central pulse pressure (PP), augmentation pressure
(AP) and both augmentation index (AIx) andAIx adjusted to
heart rate (HR) of 75 beats per minute (AIx@HR75). AIx
represents the percentage of central pulse pressure caused by
the early return of the reflected wave in the aortic root and it
is calculated using a validated mathematical transfer func-
tion. Two measurements were made, and when differences
were > 10%, a third measurement was made. The mean of
the measurements was used for analysis.

categorical variables, unless otherwise specified. The
Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests were used to
compare, respectively, the numerical and categorical
variables between groups; and the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test was used to compare variables before and after treat-
ment. We used previous studies of FMD in similar popu-
lations to estimate sample size.19 Assuming an alpha
error of 5% and a standard deviation (SD) of 3.5%, we
had 14 patients in each group with 80% power to detect
a 4% difference in FMD between groups, by the end of
the study. We used Statistica 12 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK,
USA) for database management and statistical analysis.
Results
Study cohort
A total of 47 patients were included and 30 of these were
randomized to treatment arms (Figure 1): 14 to the
benazepril group and 16 to the losartan group. The base-
line demographics and clinical characteristics of study
patients are presented in Table 1.
Clinical and laboratory parameters
The benazepril group presented non-significant higher
values of systolic (p = 0.193) and diastolic BP (p =
0.152) at baseline (Table 2). There were no statistical
differences between the benazepril and losartan groups,
both in systolic (139 versus 134 mmHg, p = 0.618) and
diastolic (82 versus 80 mmHg, p = 0.950) BP, at the end
of the study. In addition, the number of patients who
achieved a BP < 130/80 mmHg was the same between
groups (14.3% versus 12.5%, p = 0.916). The percentage
of patients requiring increased doses of study medica-
tion and thiazide association was the same, in both
groups (57% versus 50% and 17% versus 19%, p > 0.05).
Total cholesterol, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, eGFR, glucose,
glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, uric acid and microal-
buminuria were also statistically similar between groups.
Although the initial values of CRP were similar between
the groups (Table 1), CRP values were lower in the
benazepril group at the end of the study (Figure 2).
Effect on endothelial function
Baseline brachial artery diameter was similar, between
groups (4.75 versus 4.50 mm, p = 0.325). In the benazepril
group, there was a higher FMD response (45% increase)
after 12 weeks (6.05 to 8.80%, p = 0.057), although this
did not reach statistical significance. In the losartan group,
the FMD response was smaller (19% increase) after 12
weeks (7.90 to 9.40%, p = 0.132), as shown in Table 2.
Effect on pulse wave velocity and central aortic
pressure
The benazepril group presented non-significant higher
baseline values of cfPWV (p = 0.394) and central systolic
BP (p = 0.119). The other baseline variables were very

similar between the groups (Table 2). The cfPWV and
crPWV values were not significantly different in the ACEi
and ARB groups, before and after treatment (8.5 versus 8.5
m/s, p = 0.280; 10.2 versus 9.5 m/s, p = 0.724). Both
groups also presented similar central systolic BP (129 ver-
sus 123 mmHg, p = 0.934) and AIx@HR75 (29.5 versus
30.5%, p = 0.632), before and after treatment (Table 2).
Adverse effects
One (7.1%) patient had a cough in the benazepril group
and two (12.5%) patients had edema in the losartan group,
but none discontinued treatment.
Discussion
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a
major role in physiopathology of essential hypertension.
Both ACEi and ARB inhibit RAAS, although their mecha-
nisms of actions are different, raising concerns about
whether they really are interchangeable.20,21 Important
aspects are peculiar to the ACEi mechanism of action:
There is an increase in the bradykinin and the angioten-
sin-(1­7) concentrations, and both substances have vaso-
dilatory and antiproliferative actions.21 On the other hand,
angiotensin-1 receptor blockage by ARB causes upregula-
tion of angiotensin-2 receptors. Some recent studies, con-
tradicting initial reports, suggest that angiotensin-2
receptors might contribute to vascular fibrosis.22 We
designed this trial to compare the effects of benazepril and
losartan, an ACEi and an ARB, respectively, on endothe-
lial function and vascular stiffness, in patients with Type 2
diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Our findings sug-
gested that hypertensive diabetic patients using benazepril
have a greater reduction in CRP and a slight improvement
in flow-mediated vasodilation than have those taking
losartan. Moreover, these effects occurred despite similar
BP reduction.
CRP is an important inflammatory biomarker in ath-
erosclerosis and is related to leukocyte adhesion mole-
cules, tissue factors and monocyte recruitment to the
arterial wall.21 Moreover, it has prognostic significance:
Higher levels are related to worse cardiovascular out-
comes.23 Rosei et al.24 compared candesartan and enal-
april in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus. These authors find no statistical difference in
CRP concentration between ACEi and ARB. Likewise,
Schram et al.25 do not observe differences when

comparing candesartan and lisinopril; however, in their
results, CRP concentration increases in the candesartan
group and decreases in patients using lisinopril, albeit
this difference is not statistically significant. Koulouris et
al.26 observe that both ramipril and telmisartan lead to a
reduction in CRP, but there was no difference among
these drugs.
To our knowledge, the present study was the first one to
show a greater reduction of CRP with ACEi, when com-
pared to ARB. We suppose that this finding may be related
to our sample's higher baseline CRP values (0.48 and 0.31
mg/dL) than in other studies (from 0.13 to 0.30 mg/dL).24­26
During clinical consultation, we tried to exclude other
potential causes of an elevated CRP, such as infections and
rheumatic diseases. In addition, we looked for use of sali-
cylic acid and statins, which were the same between
groups. The elevated baseline CRP in both groups may
have facilitated showing even small differences in the
effects of ACEi and ARB.
Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation is a pre-
dictor of cardiovascular events, according to studies in
population-based adults27,28; and it is related to atheroscle-
rosis risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes mel-
litus.29 Three recent meta-analyses with hypertensive
patients show that both ACEi and ARB improve FMD,
when compared to placebo or no treatment, but there is no
difference among them.13­15 Eight trials compare ACEi to
ARB, but only one shows a higher FMD response with
ACEi.14,30 There were no head-to-head comparisons of
ACEi and ARB in diabetic patients.
Flammer et al.19 observe that losartan is better than ate-
nolol in improving FMD, in hypertensive diabetic patients.
Yilmaz et al.31 report that valsartan and valsartan plus
amlodipine obtain higher FMD than amlodipine mono-
therapy, in a similar population. Three trials of ACEi ver-
sus placebo or no treatment have failed to show significant
FMD improvement in mixed populations that included
diabetic patients.32­34 To date, there has been no rand-
omized trial concerning the effects of ACEi on FMD,
exclusively in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our
results suggested that there might be an improvement in
brachial FMD with benazepril use, an effect not observed
in the losartan group.
Arterial stiffness is recognized as a predictor of
increased cardiovascular risk and PWV is considered the
gold standard procedure to measure it. A meta-analysis
with more than 15,877 patients in 17 longitudinal studies
shows that an increase in PWV by 1 m/s corresponds to a
15% increase in cardiovascular mortality.35 Shahin et
al.36 carried out a meta-analysis to study the effects of
ACEi on PWV and they conclude that these drugs reduce
PWV by 1.69 m/s, when compared to placebo. Most stud-
ies are able to demonstrate that ARB reduces PWV, when
compared to placebo.37­39 Moreover, the effects of ACEi
and ARB on arterial stiffness seem to be independent of
BP reduction40; however, only four trials compare ACEi
to ARB and they do not find any difference in PWV
among these two drugs.37­39,41 Furthermore, none of these
studies include diabetic patients. Our study was the first
one to compare ACEi and ARB on PWV in diabetic
patients and it showed there was no difference in this
parameter.
Central pressure waveform methods analyze the inter-
action between arterial wall properties and the left ventri-
cle. Some authors propose them as prognostic indexes of
cardiovascular risk.42,43 As with PWV, Shahin et al.36
observe that ACEi reduces AIx, when compared with
other antihypertensive drugs. There are also reports of
AIx and central BP reduction with various ARB.39,44,45
Only one trial compares ACEi to ARB: These drugs have
the same effect on AIx,39 although it did not include dia-
betic patients. In our study, central systolic BP, central
pulse pressure, AP and AIx were also similar in both
groups.
This trial had some important limitations. First, despite
randomization, the ACEi group had a lower baseline FMD.
We do not know if this influenced a better FMD response in
this group. Second, despite statistical power calculation,
our sample size was small and so these findings should be
confirmed in trials including more patients, as small differ-
ences in PWV and central pressure waveform analysis
could be missed. Regarding PWV, 12 weeks could also be
a short time to observe antihypertensive drugs' effect on
arterial stiffness.
Conclusions
In summary, taking benazepril led to lower CRP and a
slightly higher FMD response, when compared to losartan
in hypertensive diabetic patients with BP not controlled by
amlodipine. Most hypertension guidelines recommend
ACEi or ARB as first-line therapy in diabetic patients with
high BP; however, the mechanism of action of these drugs
differ, and this may have laboratory and clinical conse-
quences. Future clinical trials with a head-to-head com-
parison and larger samples are necessary, to elucidate
whether the differences between ACEi and ARB have
prognostic relevance.
