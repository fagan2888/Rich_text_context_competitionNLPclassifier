Abstract
Background: The current study investigated the association between breastfeeding and adult weight distribution
using an emerging indicator of weight distribution, the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR).
Methods: The study sample consisted of two subsamples of individuals that were part of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health. One sample (n = 1 179) consisted of individuals from the sibling pair data. A second
sample (n = 4 648) consisted of individuals that were not part of the paired data. Regression models were constructed
to establish if there was a relationship between breastfeeding and two measures of weight distribution: WHtR and
body mass index (BMI). Controls for parental socioeconomic status, maternal smoking, race, sex, age, birth weight,
maternal BMI, genetic ancestry, and a genetic risk score (GRS) for obesity were included. In addition, a behavioral risk
score (BRS) was constructed to control for other residual confounding factors.
Results: A significant, inverse relationship between breastfeeding and adult WHtR persisted in models constructed
from the sibling pair sample (P = 0.002) and unrelated sample (P <0.0001). This association remained significant with
the inclusion of ancestry principal components, GRS, and a measure of maternal obesity.
Conclusions: The moderate association between breastfeeding and weight distribution persists into adulthood while
controlling for potential confounders. This paper also provides evidence that the WHtR may be a superior outcome
measure to BMI in studies investigating breastfeeding and obesity.

Background
The prevalence of obesity and overweight has increased
significantly over the past two decades. Among non-
Hispanic white men, the prevalence of obesity increased
from 20.3 % in the years 1994­1998 to 35.7 % by 2009­
2010 [1]. Recent estimates place the number of over-
weight at one billion worldwide, of which 300 million
are classified as obese [2]. As such, the obesity epidemic
has become one of the most pressing public health is-
sues facing global populations.
Increases in obesity prevalence have been linked to an
increasingly sedentary lifestyle and consumption of a
low quality diet, but these factors alone do not com-
pletely explain the nature of the epidemic, nor the fact
that some are more prone to becoming obese and
retaining weight than others [3, 4]. One of the most
important early developmental factors of interest is
breastfeeding. A recent study from a sample of over-
weight adolescents revealed that breastfeeding of an in-
fant is associated with lower incidence of obesity and
complications related to metabolic syndrome in the off-
spring [5]. Other studies have revealed that longer dur-
ation of breastfeeding of an infant may be protective
against obesity in childhood or reduce the risk of being
overweight in childhood [6­9]. Researchers have identi-
fied several physiological links between breastfeeding
and body size of the offspring. In addition to fatty acids,
vitamins, and minerals, breast milk also contains a di-
verse population of bacteria that colonize the intestinal
tract of the infant and may have protective benefits
against weight gain throughout life [10]. Breastfeeding
duration may also delay the introduction of solid foods
for the infant, which has been linked to childhood obes-
ity in some cohorts [11]. However, other studies have
found this not to be predictive of obesity [10].

Despite these findings, studies that link breastfeeding
to weight status often come under scrutiny. One reason
is that the evidence comes solely from observational
studies, as randomized trials for breastfeeding would be
unethical [12]. The observational studies that do exist
have potentially serious problems with selection bias
(e.g., those that are most likely to breastfeed may also be
the most likely to lead a lifestyle that is related to a
healthy body mass index (BMI)) and residual confound-
ing, as breastfeeding is strongly associated with import-
ant characteristics of mothers. [6, 12­14] Nevertheless,
recent studies have attempted to reduce residual con-
founding and selection bias by using sibling pairs that
were discordant for breastfeeding [15, 16]. They found
that the relationship between breastfeeding and BMI ob-
served in between-families analyses was no longer sig-
nificant in the within-family analysis.
This study builds upon earlier work by using an emer-
ging indicator of weight distribution, the waist-to-height
ratio (WHtR), as the primary outcome variable to test
this association [17, 18]. There is evidence that the
WHtR may be a more accurate diagnostic tool for
obesity-related chronic diseases than the more trad-
itional BMI because it more accurately characterizes adi-
posity [18]. It is known that visceral fat is more
metabolic and inflammatory than adipose tissue in other
subcutaneous regions [19, 20]. This concept is also sup-
ported by a meta-analysis performed by Ashwell et al.
(2012) which showed that the WHtR consistently dis-
criminated better for co-morbidities associated with
obesity than BMI and waist circumference [17]. Further,
in the context of early developmental factors, using
height in combination with waist circumference may re-
sult in a more sensitive measure to detect early develop-
mental factors associated with obesity. This is because
poor fetal nutrition is associated with both short stature
and overweight status [18]. We also perform analyses
using BMI to allow for comparisons between previously
conducted studies of breastfeeding and measures of
body mass. Finally, on a subset of the overall sample, we
utilize genome-wide association data to incorporate a
genetic risk score (GRS) for BMI as well as measures of
genetic ancestry.
Methods
Participants
The study utilized a sample of individuals from the Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health) [21]. Add Health is a longitudinal study that in-
vestigates how social and environmental factors may in-
fluence health. It has followed a cohort of individuals
through four waves of interviewing and testing since its
inception during the 1994­1995 school year. The full
Add Health study consisted of 20 792 participants.
However, a substantial amount of this sample was not
part of the Wave 1 parent interviews or measured for
waist circumference and height at Wave 4. In addition,
genome-wide association data is available on the sibling
pair (SP) sample only. Therefore, we analyzed a sub-
sample of 1 179 respondents with genome-wide data
from the SP sample as well as 4 648 respondents from
the unrelated (UN) sample. Also, to ensure that the re-
latedness of the siblings was not impacting the associa-
tions observed in the SP sample, we randomly selected
one participant from each sibling pair resulting in a third
sample of 856 respondents and performed analyses on
this sample. Variables from all four waves of interviews
and measurements from the Add Health Study were
used. In an effort to retain the largest possible sample
size, missingness was allowed for two covariates in the
analysis: birth weight and parental smoking.
Data
The specific Add Health variable code names used in
this study are listed in the supplementary information
section to this paper (Additional file 2: Table S1). The
primary variables of interest in this study were breast-
feeding, WHtR, and BMI. Breastfeeding data were ex-
tracted from the in-home parent interviews conducted
during Wave 1 (baseline). The options provided for the
breastfeeding question were "Never Breastfed", "0­3
Months", "3­6 Months", "6­9 Months", "9­12 Months",
"12­24 Months", and "Greater than 24 Months." We re-
moved any cases of missingness for breastfeeding from
our analyses. In an effort to reduce any potential recall
bias that may exist in the reporting of duration of
breastfeeding, we opted to analyze breastfeeding only as
a dichotomous variable. Individuals that were never
breastfed were coded as "0" while those that were breast-
fed were coded as "1".
Height (cm) and waist circumference (cm) were ex-
tracted from the Add Health Wave 4 anthropometric
measurements. Waist circumference was measured to
the nearest 0.5 cm at the superior border of the iliac
crest. [21] The WHtR metric was calculated by dividing
waist circumference by height. BMI values were also
taken from Wave 4 data. As with breastfeeding, we re-
moved any cases from our analyses that were missing
for WHtR and BMI.
To control for behavioral differences between indi-
viduals, we utilized risk scores constructed from a
variety of indicators. The risk scores were calculated
using the R package, pcaMethods, and allowed for
missing data [22]. For this study, the behavioral risk
scores (BRS) are the first three principal components
derived from a cluster of items regarding diet, sleep,
and exercise. The BRS components were validated
using both Wave 4 WHtR and BMI. The specific Add

Health variables used and details on how the risk
scores were constructed can be found in the supple-
mentary information (Additional file 1 and Additional
file 2: Table S2).
A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated for each in-
dividual in the SP data set. Genome-wide association
studies have identified 31 single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) in individuals of European descent and 8
SNPs in individuals of African American descent that
are associated with BMI [23, 24]. These SNPs were used
to compute risks scores, and analyses were conducted
testing the association of these risk scores with BMI,
obesity, WHtR, and change in BMI over time. A more in
depth description of these risk scores and their construc-
tion using the SP sample can be found in Domingue et
al. [25]. To develop our measure of genetic ancestry, we
used KING to identify clusters of individuals based upon
genetic similarity [26]. KING uses multidimensional
scaling (MDS) with Euclidean distance to generate prin-
cipal coordinates (PCs) that can be used to identify
population substructure. A full description of the
derivation of the ancestry PCs can be found in McQueen
et al. [27].
In addition to the calculated risk scores, we used the
following controls: birth weight (lb.); parental SES; par-
ental smoking; maternal obesity; gender; age; and race.
Birth weights for the subjects were obtained from the
Wave 1 in-home parent interviews. Because low birth
weight is hypothesized to be associated with higher
WHtR in adulthood, birth weight was assessed as a cat-
egorical variable that compared low birth weight sub-
jects to normal birth weight subjects. Low birth weight
status was assigned to subjects that weighed less than 2
500 g (5.5 lb.). As stated above, this variable allowed for
missingness and was analyzed as a factor, with low birth
weight and missing birth weight compared to the refer-
ent category, normal birth weight.
Self-reported parental smoking status was also ex-
tracted from the Wave 1 in-home parent interviews and
analyzed as a factor, allowing for missingness, with "yes"
for smoking and missingness for smoking compared to
the referent group of nonsmoking. For a measure of ma-
ternal obesity, we used the question "Is the biological
mother obese?" from the Wave 1 in-home parent inter-
view. This variable was dichotomous, and a response of
"no" was coded as "0" while "yes" was coded as "1". Self-
reported race was analyzed as a factor, comparing His-
panic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Asian/Na-
tive American to the referent group non-Hispanic
African American. Parental SES was assessed with self-
reported household income at Wave 1 of the study and
was analyzed as a dichotomous variable. We coded those
that reported income less than the median income from
the overall sample ($38 000) as low SES ("0") and those
that reported income of greater than the median as high
SES ("1").
Descriptive statistics in total and stratified by breast-
feeding status for sex, race, parental smoking, low birth
weight occurrence, parental SES, maternal obesity, BMI,
and WHtR for the two samples can be found in Tables 1
and 2. The average age of the participants at Wave 4
was 28.49 years with a range of 24.32­33.59 years.
Breastfeeding initiation was 49.2 % in our UN sample
and 39.4 % in our SP sample. In reviewing the descrip-
tive statistics for this study, it is worth commenting on
certain elements of the sample. Rates of breastfeeding
initiation were 26.5 % in 1970 and rose to 61.9 % in
1982 [28]. As the participants in the Add Health study
were born between 1976 and 1984, it is reasonable that
the initiation rates in our samples would be between
these two rates. In addition, there are some racial dispar-
ities in the initiation of breastfeeding. African Americans
comprise 18.4 % of the individuals in the UN sample but
only 11.68 % of the individuals that were breastfed. This
disparity was observed in the SP sample as well. This is
consistent with previous literature that has demon-
strated a lower rate of breastfeeding initiation in African
Americans, while there are not large discrepancies be-
tween non-Hispanic white or Hispanics [29]. In addition,
it may explain some of the difference in breastfeeding
rates between our two samples, as the SP sample was
34.18 % African American and the UN sample was
18.42 % African American. Finally, there were differ-
ences in the rates of low birth weight between the two
samples (UN Sample: 4.65 %; SP Sample: 13.57 %) that
are likely attributed to the oversampling of African
Americans.
Statistical analysis
Unrelated sample (UN)
OLS regression models were used to investigate the rela-
tionship between breastfeeding and measures of weight
distribution. For both WHtR and BMI, breastfeeding
was the primary predictor variable of interest. As noted
above, breastfeeding was analyzed as a dichotomous
variable (ever breastfed coded as "1", never breastfed
coded as "0") in these models. Models constructed from
the UN data included all covariates with the exception
of the genetic risk scores and ancestry principal compo-
nents. We also tested for a maternal obesity and breast-
feeding interaction to assess whether or not the
association between breastfeeding and weight distribu-
tion was dependent on the weight status of the mother.
This interaction term was not significant in any of our
analyses and therefore excluded from the final models.
Additionally, we tested for an interaction between
breastfeeding and the genetic risk score that was also
not significant and excluded from the final models.

Finally, we used the Add Health Wave 1 sample weights
for all models in the UN sample. The statistical power
for these models was as follows: WHtR Outcome, (1 -
) <0.001; BMI Outcome (1 - ) <0.001.
In addition to the linear models, we also constructed
logistic regression models to further investigate the de-
crease in risk of obesity associated with breastfeeding in
both samples. For this analysis, we created a dichotom-
ous variable to indicate obesity status (BMI  30). All
analyses and calculations were done using R version
2.15.3 via the RStudio platform, version 0.97.320 [30].
Sibling Pair Sample (SP)
OLS regression models were also constructed from the
SP sample. These models included all of the covariates
that were tested in the UN sample and tested the out-
comes WHtR, BMI, and BMI  30. In addition, these
models included the PCs for genetic ancestry and the
GRS as controls. The statistical power for these models
was as follows: WHtR Outcome, (1 - ) = 0.018; BMI
Outcome (1 - ) = 0.177.
Subset of Sibling Pair Sample (SSP)
Finally, OLS regression models were also constructed
from a subset of the SP sample. One participant was
randomly selected from each of the sibling pairs, and the
OLS models described for the SP sample were also con-
structed from this subset. The statistical power for these
models was as follows: WHtR Outcome, (1 - ) = 0.093;
BMI Outcome (1 - ) = 0.422.

with a decrease in both WHtR and BMI. All other fac-
tors being equal, breastfeeding was associated with a de-
crease in predicted adult WHtR of 0.012 and in
predicted adult BMI of 0.548. We observed a consistent
effect in the SP sample, as breastfeeding was associated
with a decrease in both WHtR and BMI. Once again, all
other factors being equal, breastfeeding was associated
with a decrease in predicted adult WHtR of 0.020 and
predicted adult BMI of 1.049. As anticipated, the GRS is
a highly significant predictor of body weight measures in
all models constructed from the SP sample. The third
principal component for ancestry was a significant pre-
dictor of both WHtR and BMI in the SP sample while
the fifth principal component was predictive of BMI
only. All three principal components of the BRS were
significant predictors of body weight measures in our
UN sample, but only the first principal component
remained significant with the inclusion of the GRS in
the SP sample.
The results from the logistic regression model are pre-
sented in Table 5 and include calculated odds ratios,
95 % confidence intervals, and P values. Consistent with
the results of the linear models, breastfeeding was asso-
ciated with a decreased risk of obesity in the UN sample
(OR = 0.854, 95 % CI = (0.75, 0.97)). With all other fac-
tors being equal, having been breastfed was associated
with a 0.854 odds of obesity compared to those that
were not breastfed. Conversely, those that were not
breastfed were 1.171 times more likely to be obese than
those that were breastfed with all else being equal.
Breastfeeding was associated with the same odds ratio in
the SP sample, though it was not statistically significant
(OR = 0.854, 95 % CI = (0.64, 1.13)).
The results of the multiple linear regression models
and logistic regression model constructed from the sub-
set of the SP sample are presented in Table 6. Consistent
with the results from both the UN sample and full SP
sample, breastfeeding was associated with a decrease in

both WHtR and BMI. All other factors being equal,
breastfeeding was associated with a decrease in pre-
dicted adult WHtR of 0.025 and in predicted adult BMI
of 1.604. In addition, the results of the logistic regression
predicting BMI  30 showed a significant association
with breastfeeding (OR = 0.695, 95 % CI = (0.50, 0.97)).
With all other factors being equal, those that were not
breastfed were 1.43 times more likely to be obese than
those that were breastfed.
Other covariates
Low birth weight was associated with decreased BMI in
our UN sample but was not a significant predictor in
any other models. Parental smoking was a significant
predictor of both BMI, WHtR, and BMI  30 in the UN
sample, but was not significant in the SP sample. Several
of our racial categories were significant predictors of
BMI in the UN sample. Reporting non-Hispanic white
or non-Hispanic Asian/Native American was associated
with a decrease in predicted BMI when compared with
the referent group, non-Hispanic African American.
However, this effect was only seen for those reporting
white for the WHtR outcome. Of particular note, race
was not a significant predictor in any of models from
the SP sample or the subset from the SP sample. Our
measure of parental SES was inversely related to WHtR
and BMI in the UN sample and was trending in the SP
sample. Parental SES was also a significant predictor of
WHtR and was trending for BMI in the subset of the SP
sample. Our variable for maternal obesity was a strong
positive predictor of BMI, WHtR, and BMI  30 in all
samples.
Discussion
Previous research has linked a variety of early childhood
factors to the health status of adults [31]. A great deal of
recent interest has focused on breastfeeding as an im-
portant determinant of health status into adulthood, and
our study contributes to this body of work in several im-
portant ways. Few studies investigating the role breast-
feeding use the WHtR as an outcome as opposed to
BMI, and to our knowledge none have done so with
adults. This is important because, while there are de-
bates about the value of the BMI in epidemiologic re-
search, the WHtR has been shown to be a superior
indicator of physical composition as it describes the dis-
tribution of weight. [17­20] As such the inclusion of this
measure enhances our understanding of the role of
breastfeeding for the health of populations.

Second, the Add Health study has several features that
enhance the validity of our findings. For example, BMI
and WHtR were both measured in the field by trained
technicians rather than self-reported. The design of the
Add Health study allows for opportunity to make true
population inferences not only about prevalence and in-
cidence but more importantly about key associational
parameters such as breastfeeding and adult health. The
richness of these data allow us to include detailed and
comprehensive measures of behavioral and environ-
mental risks, such as SES, diet, and exercise, that may
confound the association. In addition, our regression
models had controls in place for race, parental SES,
parental smoking, maternal obesity, and low birth
weight. Finally, controlling for maternal obesity pro-
vides additional support that the association between
breastfeeding and weight distribution is not dependent
on family factors.
Finally, we were able to establish a consistent effect of
breastfeeding on both WHtR and BMI in both Add
Health subsamples. This finding was robust in the SP
data set that included genetic risk factors for BMI/obes-
ity as well as measures of genetic ancestry. We further
tested this finding on a subset of the SP sample, demon-
strating that this association was not due to the related-
ness of the subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to assess the role of breastfeeding on weight distri-
bution using measured genetic factors that could influ-
ence the risk of obesity. The robustness of the
association between breastfeeding and measures of
weight status controlling for genetics is novel and
provides additional support for the association be-
tween breastfeeding and weight distribution that has
been reported elsewhere.
There are many characteristics of breastfeeding that
may help to explain how feeding practice early in life

can influence weight distribution and possibly have pro-
tective benefits against obesity in adulthood. To begin,
breastfeeding appears to result in lower overall energy
intake than formula feeding in the early postnatal period
and is associated with an infant's ability to self-regulate
milk intake [32, 33]. These findings take on greater sig-
nificance when one considers the effect that early weight
gain can have on weight status in later childhood and
even adulthood. There is evidence that overweight status
in childhood has an impact on the risk of being over-
weight in adulthood [33]. In addition, rapid weight gain
in infancy is related to being overweight later in child-
hood [34].
A recent study that is most comparable to the current
study was conducted by Rousseaux et al. [35]. The study
used multivariate analysis to test for relationships with
measures of body composition including WHtR. It
found no significant associations between breastfeeding
and measures of body composition. However, a nonsig-
nificant trend towards a protective benefit was identified
on the highest percentiles of abdominal adiposity. The
two studies differed in the age of the participants in
addition to a large difference in mean WHtR, which
could account for the disparity in the findings. Given
that HELENA is a cohort study, future research is war-
ranted to test for the association in adulthood.
A previous study that is in conflict with the current
study was a randomized control trial conducted in
Belarus. This trial was a breastfeeding promotion inter-
vention, and found that the intervention increased the
duration of breastfeeding but did not influence weight
or adiposity at roughly 6.5 years old [12]. However, the
study was conducted in Belarus, a country that does not
have a comparable prevalence of obesity to the United
States. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to
the cohort used in the current study. In addition, this
study influenced only duration of breastfeeding and not
initiation. The current study compared individuals that
were breastfed to those that were not breastfed. It may
be possible that while long duration of breastfeeding
doesn't add any additional risk reduction benefit, breast-
feeding in early infancy may convey a significant benefit
vs. individuals that were never breastfed at all.
Another study that contrasted with ours and used the
Add Health sample was conducted by Evenhouse and
Reilly. It found no differences in BMI between sibling
pairs discordant for breastfeeding [15]. Utilizing a
within-family discordant sibling model is an efficient ap-
proach to control for family-level effects including gen-
etic ancestry, race, and SES. However, there are other
differences between the two studies that could account
for the contrasting findings. First, within-family analyses

using discordant sibling pairs can be limited by within-
family variation in breastfeeding. As noted in Evanhouse
and Reilly, there were 523 sibling pairs discordant for
breastfeeding duration and only 288 pairs discordant for
breastfeeding (one sibling breastfed, the other did not).
Given the relatively high correlation of BMI within
sibling pairs (heritability estimates range from 60 to
80 %), it is possible that a discordant sibling pair
study was underpowered to detect an association due
to breastfeeding [36, 37]. Additionally, the present
study used the participants BMI and WHtR at Wave
4 as opposed to Wave 1, which would have reduced
our sample size for pairs discordant for breastfeeding
initiation to 62 and substantially reduced our statis-
tical power to detect any differences between siblings
discordant for breastfeeding. Finally, we observed that
WHtR may be a more sensitive measure of body
weight compared to BMI as it relates to the associ-
ation with breastfeeding.
Limitations
One of the primary criticisms of breastfeeding studies in
general is related to residual confounding and recall bias.
In this study, we were not able to control for maternal
diet, which is often implicated in early infant weight gain
and childhood obesity. In addition, the information on
breastfeeding duration was via self-report from the
mothers. On average, mothers would have been asked
about breastfeeding duration approximately 12­15 years
after the breastfeeding took place. It is unclear as to
whether recall biases may exist in this regard. However,
there aren't any reasons to expect systematic differences
in recall for those individuals who have overweight chil-
dren vs. those that do not. In addition, we analyzed

breastfeeding strictly as an ever/never variable. While
this has the detrimental effect of not discriminating be-
tween infants that were breastfed for a day and those
that were breastfed for two years, it may have minimized
some of the recall bias. Also, our control for maternal
obesity was a self-reported measure at the time of the
questionnaire. While this isn't an ideal measure of ma-
ternal obesity at the time of the child's birth, the rate of
obesity in the UN sample (18.46 %) is consistent with
NHANES measures from 1976 to 1980 (17.1 %) [38],
and we feel that the mother's weight status at the time
of the parental survey may serve as an appropriate proxy
for her status during and after pregnancy. Finally, we did
not have information on whether or not the reported
breastfeeding duration was exclusive or partial, and it is
possible that the relationship between weight distribu-
tion and breastfeeding status could be affected by
whether or not the breastfeeding was supplemented with
solid food.
The genetic risk score consisted of 31 SNPs that had
been validated using a sample of both black and white
young adults from the Add Health Study [25]. As such,
these SNPs were used to construct the genetic risk score
in the current study. Genome-wide association studies
have identified 90+ SNPs that are associated with body
mass/obesity. However, for the purposes of this study,
we were not focused on developing an optimal set of
SNPs to predict body mass/obesity. Rather, our analysis
was focused on an established set of SNPs that suffi-
ciently accounts for the genetic risk of obesity [39­42].
While additional SNPs (90+ or including genome-wide
SNPs) would result in a slightly better genetic risk score
prediction, we are confident that adding the very small
effects of these additional SNPs would not impact our
primary analytic aim: relating breastfeeding to WHtR.
Additionally, the measures of genetic ancestry were in-
cluded to adjust our analyses for potential genetic (as
opposed to racial/ethnic) differences on the genome-
wide scale.
Finally, the analysis was limited due to the availability
of the genetic measures in the sibling pair sample. We
tested for whether or not the relationship we observed
between breastfeeding and measures of weight status in
the sibling sample was an artifact of the relatedness of
the participants. We randomly sampled one sibling from
each pair and conducted the analyses on these partici-
pants. In all follow-up analyses, we observed the consist-
ent, significant relationship between breastfeeding and
measures of weight status. While other methods may be
more efficient in the context of biologically related indi-
viduals (i.e., mixed effects regression) we were not inter-
ested in studying the family-level effects in these
analyses. Furthermore, there are a limited number of sib-
ling pairs discordant for breastfeeding, which diminishes
our ability to assess any family-level impact on the asso-
ciation of interest.
Conclusion
Overall, we contend that our collective attention to race,
SES, GRS, maternal obesity, and BRS would broadly
serve as correlates of various lifestyle and body weight
indicators. Residual confounding undoubtedly remains
in these analyses. However, there would have to be sub-
stantial unmeasured confounding influence to be able to
explain enough of the relationship between breastfeeding
and weight distribution to completely ameliorate the as-
sociations observed in this study.
In conclusion, the results of the current study demon-
strated that breastfeeding is inversely related to the
WHtR in adulthood. While many studies have reported
a relationship between breastfeeding duration and
weight in childhood, few others have reported this asso-
ciation in a young adult population. Also the current
study provided evidence that WHtR may be a more sen-
sitive outcome variable than BMI for studies that investi-
gate the association between breastfeeding and weight
distribution or status. Finally, the current study demon-
strated both the utility of using genetic factors under-
lying obesity as well as evaluating the robustness of the
breastfeeding association controlling for these factors.
We encourage future studies to investigate the mecha-
nisms that may be responsible for the role of breastfeed-
ing on weight distribution.
