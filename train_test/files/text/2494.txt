ABSTRACT
Background: This study explored crosscountry differences in how multimorbidity explains
the effects of socioeconomic characteristics on selfrated health.
Methods: The study borrowed data from the Research on Early Life and Aging Trends and
Effects. Participants were 44,530 individuals (age >65 years) who were sampled from 15
countries (i.e. United States, China, India, Russia, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Argentina,
Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Uruguay, Ghana and South Africa). Multimorbidity was
measured as number of chronic medical conditions. In Model I, main effects of socioeconomic
factors on selfrated health were calculated using countryspecific logistic regressions. In
Model II, number of chronic conditions were also added to the models to find changes in
coefficients for demographic and socioeconomic factors.
Results: In the United States, number of chronic medical conditions explained the effect of
income on subjective health. In Puerto Rico, number of chronic medical conditions explained
the effect of marital status on subjective health. In Costa Rica, Argentina, Barbados, Cuba,
and Uruguay, number of chronic medical conditions explained gender disparities in subjective
health. In China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Chile, India, Ghana and South Africa, number of
chronic medical conditions did not explain the effect of demographic or socioeconomic factors
on subjective health.
Conclusions: Multimorbidity explains the effect of demographic and socioeconomic factors
on subjective health in some but not other countries. Further research is needed.
Keywords: Chronic medical conditions, physical health, sociodemographics, subjective health

wellbeing.[16] World Values Survey, European Values
Study, Eurobarometer, and Latinobarometer, have shown
selfrated health, physical health, life expectancy, and
allcause mortality vary across countries.[710] What is,
however, not known is crosscountry differences in factors
that influence health and wellbeing.
Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with health
and wellbeing.[11] High social status provides multiple
benefits for individuals through a higher access to
financial and material resources.[12] Unfortunately, most
of our knowledge about the mechanisms of the effects
of SES on health and wellbeing has originated from

studies conducted within a single country,[13,14] thus
crosscountry comparison of mechanisms for the effects
of SES on health is still needed.[15-18]
Gender is a demographic and social factor with major
implications for health and wellbeing.[19] Compared
to men, women tend to report a higher number
of chronic conditions and also poorer selfreported
health.[19,20] Pinquart and Sörensen listed four reasons
for gender differences in subjective measures of health.
First, women may have lower material resources due to
gender inequities and gendered social power. Gendered
labor market may result in lower stable employment
among women.[11] Among those in the labor market,
women's pensions are lower than men's.[21,22] Women
more frequently live in poverty than older men.[23]
Women also have lower access to health care resources
while also requiring more care in later life than men.[24]
Due to gender difference in longevity, a larger part of
women's life is spent with illness and disabilities.[25]
Third, older women are more likely to be widowed than
older men.[23] In the United States, nearly four times
as many older women than men live alone.[24] Finally,
due to gender differences in response sets, women may
have a higher tendency to report negative feelings and
emotions.[26]
Multimorbidity  defined as multiple chronic medical
conditionsis an important predictor of subjective
health,[11] as people with higher number of chronic
medical conditions report lower physical and mental
healthrelated quality of life (HRQL).[2729] In one
study, chronic medical conditions had a consistent
dosedependent effect on all aspects of wellbeing,
namely physical functioning, role limitation due to
physical health problems, bodily pain, general health,
vitality, social functioning, role limitation due to
emotional problems and mental health.[30] Another
study in the United States showed that any additional
chronic medical condition leads to 3­4 decrements of
mental quality of life decline.[31] Another study among
21,133 showed an association between the presence
of one chronic condition and lower wellbeing across
all subjective health domains including physical
function, fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and social
function. The presence of two or more morbidities was
associated with a larger decrement in HRQL, compared
to a single condition.[32] Another large study of adults
showed that after adjustments for SES, and health
behaviors (i.e., smoking, alcohol consumption, and
physical activity), people with 3 or more chronic medical
conditions are more likely to report poor general health,
mental distress, physical distress, and activity limitations
compared to individuals who have one or two chronic
conditions.[33,34]
Despite our knowledge about crosscountry differences in
health and wellbeing,[710] it is not clear if countries are
also different in the mechanisms by which demographic
(i.e., age and gender), and socioeconomic (e.g., income
and education) influence health, and if chronic medical
conditions explain some of health disparities associated
with low SES.[16] Research on Early Life and Aging Trends
and Effects (RELATE) has provided a unique opportunity
for crosscountry studies on socioeconomic, chronic medical
conditions and subjective health among the elderly. The
RELATE is a crossnational survey in 15 countries located
in North America, South America, Asia, and Africa.[35,36]
Using RELATE data, this study compared 15 countries
for the mediating effect of multimorbidity (defined as
number of chronic medical conditions) on the effects
of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics on
self rated health.
METHODS
Study design and participants
Data came from the RELATE, a study composed of the
following national surveys: (1) China Health and Nutrition
Study (CHNS), (2) Chinese Longitudinal Healthy
Longevity Survey, (3) Costa Rican Study of Longevity and
Healthy Aging, (4) Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions,
(5) Study of Aging Survey on Health and Wellbeing of
Elders, (6) WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult
Health, and (7) Wisconsin Longitudinal Study.[35,36]
We included 44,530 elderly individuals (age >65 years).
Participants were sampled in the following 15 countries:
Puerto Rico (n = 3,102, 7.0%), Costa Rica (n = 2,374,
5.3%), China (n = 2,2034, 49.5%), India (n = 2069,
4.6%), Mexico (n = 2,031, 4.6%), Ghana (n = 1,923,
4.3%), Russia (n = 1,860, 4.2%), Brazil (n = 1633, 3.7%),
Cuba (n = 1,345, 3.0%), South Africa (n = 1,333, 3.0%)
Barbados (n = 1,160, 2.6%), Uruguay (n = 1,066, 2.4%),
Chile (n = 958, 2.2%), United States (n = 894, 2.0%),
Argentina (n = 748, 1.7%).
From the participating countries, Barbados, Puerto
Rico and the United States represent highincome
countries; Argentina, Cuba, Uruguay, Chile, Costa
Rica, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia represent upper
middleincome countries; China and India represent
lower middleincome countries; and Ghana represents
a lowincome country. Thus, the RELATE project
represented countries from a diverse range in national
income levels.
Measures
Demographic characteristics
The study collected data on age (continuous variable)
and gender (dichotomous variable).

International Journal of Preventive Medicine 2015, 6:85 http://www.ijpvmjournal.net/content/6/1/85
Socioeconomic characteristics
The study also measured the following socioeconomic
factors: Education level (fourlevel categorical variable
of no schooling, primary to elementary, secondary to
intermediate, and higher), household income (continuous
variable), and marital status (dichotomous variable of
married and other statuses).
Multimorbidity
We measured multimorbidity as number of chronic
medical conditions. Chronic medical conditions were
measured based on selfreported physician diagnosis of
seven conditions (i.e., hypertension, cancer, pulmonary
disease, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and arthritis). The
multimorbidity score potentially ranged from 0 to 7, with
a higher score indicative of the higher number of chronic
medical conditions. The agreement between selfreport
and physician diagnosis of chronic medical conditions has
been shown to be high (kappa: 0.74­0.92).[37]
Main outcome
The outcome was subjective health (selfrated health),
which was measured using a singleitem. Although it was
measured using a five Likert scale (i.e., very bad health,
bad, moderate, good, very good), we collapsed the scale
to a dichotomous outcome: Poor health (very bad health,
bad health) versus good health (moderate health, good
health, very good health).
Singleitem measures of subjective health and wellbeing
have been frequently used and are well accepted.[3846]
Testretest reliability for singleitem is high for brief time
intervals, with a range from 0.7 to 0.8.[42] Validation studies
have consistently shown surprisingly high correlations
between singleitem indicators and multiitem measures
of perceived health.[42] Singleitem measures of selfrated
health also have high predictive validity for mortality
above and beyond traditional risk factors.[47]
Data analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using  SPSS 20.0
for Windows (IBM Inc. Armonk, NY). We used
countryspecific logistic regressions to determine if
the effects of demographic (i.e., age and gender) and
socioeconomic (i.e., education, income, and marital
status) factors vary across countries or not.
We also tested if number of chronic medical conditions
differently explains the links between demographic and
socioeconomic factors and subjective health. Although
most countryspecific surveys had sampling weights, the
current study did not apply sampling weights, because
sampling weights were not applicable to data from United
States (Wisconsin) and China (CHNS).
Mediation analysis
For this purpose, we used hierarchical regression approach.
In Model I, only demographic and socioeconomic factors
were included. In Model II, we also entered number of
chronic physical conditions. Changes in the regression
coefficients of demographic and socioeconomic factors
from significant to nonsignificant association was defined
as full mediation.[48]
RESULTS
Table 1 shows that mean age, education, income, and
number of chronic medical conditions were significantly
different across countries.
Model I
Based on Model I, high age was associated with better
subjective health in China, Costa Rica and Argentina.
High age was associated with poor subjective health
in Barbados, India, South Africa and Russia. Age and
subjective health were not significantly associated In
Puerto Rico, United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Cuba
and Uruguay [Table 2].
Female gender was associated with worse subjective
health in China, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Barbados, Cuba
and Uruguay. Gender was not associated with subjective
health in other countries [Table 2].
In the US, Ghana and South Africa, education was
not associated with subjective health High education
was associated with high subjective health in all other
countries [Table 2].
Surprisingly, high income was associated with poor
subjective health in Ghana. In Argentina, Chile, Cuba,
Uruguay and South Africa, income was not associated
with subjective health. In other countries, highincome
was associated with better subjective health [Table 2].
Being currently married was associated with better
subjective health in Mexico. Being currently married was
associated with worse subjective health in Costa Rica,
Puerto Rico, and Brazil. Marital status was not associated
with subjective health in other countries [Table 2].
Model II
The number of chronic conditions explained the
association between gender and subjective health in Costa
Rica, Argentina, Barbados, Cuba, Uruguay. In these 5
countries, the significant association between gender and
subjective health became nonsignificant after introducing
the number of chronic conditions to the model [Table 3].
In the US, number of chronic conditions explained the
association between income and subjective health. That
said, the association between income and subjective
health that was significant in the previous model did not
remain significant after entering number of conditions to
the model [Table 3].
In Puerto Rico, number of conditions explained the
association between marital status and subjective health.
That said, the association between marital status and

International Journal of Preventive Medicine 2015, 6:85 http://www.ijpvmjournal.net/content/6/1/85
subjective health that was significant in the absence of
number of chronic conditions in the previous model did
not stay significant after entering this variable to the
model. Interestingly, after entering number of conditions
to the model, the nonsignificant association between age
and subjective health became statistically significant.
This finding suggests that number of conditions may
have a suppressor effect on age ­ subjective health
association [Table 3].
In China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Chile, India, Ghana, and
South Africa, number of chronic medical conditions did
not fully explain the associations between demographic
and SES and subjective health. In other words, in these
countries, the associations between demographic and
SES factors and subjective health were above and beyond
number of chronic medical conditions [Table 3].
DISCUSSION
This study documented major crosscountry differences
in the role of multimorbidity ­ defined as number
of chronic medical conditions - in explaining the
associations between demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics and subjective health. In Costa Rica,
Argentina, Barbados, Cuba, and Uruguay, number of
chronic medical conditions explain the association
between gender and subjective health. In the United
States number of chronic medical conditions explained
the association between income and subjective health.
In Puerto Rico, they explain the association between
marital status and subjective health. In China, Mexico,
Brazil, Russia, Chile, India, Ghana and South Africa,
number of conditions do not explain the associations
between SES and subjective health. These findings
suggest that mechanisms for the effects of demographic
and socioeconomic factors on self rated health may vary
across countries.
Women reported worse self rated health only in
six countries (i.e. China, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico,
Barbados, Cuba and Uruguay), and in Costa Rica,
Argentina, Barbados, Cuba, and Uruguay, chronic
conditions explained such an association. Literature
has consistently shown gender differences in health and
wellbeing.[19] Although some researchers have attributed
the effect of gender on perceived health to income,[2123]
and marital status,[23,24] the effect of gender on self rated
health was above and beyond these SES factors in our
study. Research has shown that women report higher
number of chronic conditions and poorer health,[19] and
we found that higher rate of multimorbidity may be the
reason female gender is associated with poor selfrated
health, at least in some countries in South America.
Multimorbidity had a suppressor effect on the association
between age and self rated health in Puerto Rico. That is,
only after controlling for number of chronic conditions,
the association between age and self rated health became
significant. This finding has important implications for
future research on age effect on subjective health in
Puerto Rico. The inclusion of a suppressor to a regression
equation is known to enhances the relationship between
subjective health and age in this country by removing
the unwanted variance from the predictor variable.[49] In
other words, in Puerto Rico, studies that wish to test the
association between age and wellbeing need to control
for number of conditions not as a mediator, but as a
suppressor.
With an exception of only three countries (i.e. United
States, Ghana and South Africa), education was
associated with a better subjective health. United States,
Ghana, and South Africa were the three countries where
education did not independently predict self rated health.
In some countries, the effect of education on health and
wellbeing may be due to income or marital status,[50]
which were both controlled in our study.
In nine countries including the United States, high
income was associated with better self rated health.
Surprisingly, high income was found to be associated with
poor subjective health in Ghana. In five other countries,
income was not associated with self rated health. Why
income does not have a protective effect on perceived
health in Ghana, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Uruguay, and
South Africa needs more research.

factors shape populations' access to resources may vary
from one to another country. Thus, countries may differ
on how social and health factors confound, mediate, or
suppress the effects of demographic and socioeconomic
factors on health and well-being. There is empirical
evidence suggesting that the complex interrelation
between socioeconomics, chronic medical conditions, and
subjective health vary across countries.[1618,46]
Interestingly, number of chronic medical conditions did
not fully explain the effect of age on subjective health
in any of the 15 countries. Age and subjective health
were differently linked across countries, as well. In three
countries (i.e. China, Costa Rica and Argentina), high age
was associated with better subjective health, while in four
countries (i.e. Barbados, India, South Africa and Russia),
high age was associated with low subjective health.
Interestingly, in seven other countries (i.e. Puerto Rico,
United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Cuba and Uruguay),
there was no linear association between age and subjective
health. There are studies reporting a positive net effect of
age on wellbeing among the elderly.[51,52]
The number of chronic medical conditions explained
the association between marital status and subjective
health in Puerto Rico. Being currently married was
associated with better subjective health in Mexico. The
same status was linked to worse subjective health in three
other countries (i.e. Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and Brazil).
Marital status was not associated with subjective health
in the other 11 countries. The two main hypotheses
explaining health effects of marital status are marriage
protection and marriage selection.[5355] None of these
theories, however, have hypothesized being married as a
risk factor for health. More research is needed to find out
why married people do worse in Costa Rica, Puerto Rico,
and Brazil.
Limitations
There are a number of limitations to consider. First,
the study was a crosssectional study, and causative
associations are not plausible. In addition, cross ­ country
differences in the validity of chronic medical conditions
measurement and even subjective health cannot be
ruled out. The study did not measure mental health as
a predictor of selfrated health. Exclusion of individuals
with a mental disorder limits generalizability of the
findings to the populations. The study also ignores the
type of chronic conditions, as only number of conditions
were included in the models.
CONCLUSIONS
To conclude, our study suggests crosscountry differences
in the way number of chronic medical conditions may
explain the effects of demographic and socioeconomic
factors on subjective health.
