Abstract
This paper assesses the impact of a certain structure of interbank exposures on the sta-
bility of a stylized financial system. Given a certain balance sheet structure of financial
institutions, a large number of valid matrices of interbank exposures is created by a random
generator. Assuming a certain loss given default, domino effects are simulated. The main
results are, first, that financial stability depends not only on the completeness and inter-
connectedness of the network but also on the distribution of interbank exposures within the
system (measured by entropy). Second, looking at random graphs, the sign of the corre-
lation between the degree of equality of the distribution of claims and financial stability
depends on the connectivity of the financial system as well as on additional parameters that
affect the vulnerability of the system to interbank contagion. Third, the more concentrated
assets are within a money center model, the less stable it is. Fourth, a money center model
with asset concentration among core banks is less stable than a random graph with banks
of homogeneous size. Results obtained in this paper extend existing theoretical literature
that exclusively focuses on completeness and interconnectedness of the network as well as
empirical literature that exclusively focuses on one particular financial network.
Keywords: domino effects, interbank lending, financial stability, contagion

Non-technical summary
Within this paper, the impact of domino effects on the stability of a stylized interbank network
is analyzed by simulation. Whereas empirical literature on this topic exclusively investigates
one particular (real-world) financial network, theoretical (analytical as well as simulation-based)
literature has its focus on the impact of completeness and interconnectedness of a network on its
stability. This paper extends existing theoretical network simulations by an additional parame-
ter: the degree of equality of the distribution of interbank exposures.
The analysis is implemented for different structures of interbank connections: first, the complete
network, where each bank is directly linked to all other banks in both directions; second, a
network where banks form their linkages randomly; and third, a money center model, where a
distinction is made between completely interconnected core banks with large balance sheet totals
and small banks in the periphery that are only connected to one core bank.
The results of this paper can be compared to previous theoretical results, that show a non-
monotonic relationship between the completeness of networks and their stability. Simulation
results that are only made dependent on the completeness and interconnectedness of the finan-
cial system confirm these findings. If, however, results are additionally made dependent on the
degree of equality of the distribution of interbank exposures, some deviant cases can be shown.
Thus, the first result of the paper is that not only the completeness and interconnectedness of
the network determines its stability but also how equally interbank exposures are distributed.
The second result is that the sign of the correlation between the degree of equality of the distri-
bution of interbank exposures and the average number of bank failures depends on the number
of interbank links within the financial system as well as on banks' equity ratio and the loss given
default.
Third, within a money center model, an increasing concentration of assets on core banks de-
creases the stability of the system. Fourth, assuming reasonable parameter values concerning
the amount of bilateral interbank exposures, money center systems with asset concentration
among core banks are more unstable than networks with banks of homogeneous size that form
their links randomly.

exposures - a parameterized analysis of the stability of financial
networks1
1 Introduction
Research on financial stability is an important topic in order to assess certain risks and dangers
within financial systems that potentially lead to huge losses for the overall economy. Especially
the investigation of various channels of interbank contagion has been in the focus of recent re-
search. In the context of this paper, interbank contagion means that the failure of one financial
institution leads to the failure of other financial institutions.
Various fields of studies have been developed to capture the numerous facets of this comprehen-
sive topic (for a literature survey, see Allen and Babus (2009)). From the theoretical point of
view, Allen and Gale (2000) show that interbank connections can be useful in order to provide an
insurance against liquidity shocks. Because of these interbank linkages, however, the bankruptcy
of one bank can lead to the bankruptcy of other banks. In this context, Allen and Gale show that
a financial system with a complete network structure is less prone to contagion than a financial
system with an incomplete network structure. In addition, they state that a disconnected system
is useful to limit contagion. Freixas et al. (2000) implement, among other things, a theoretical
analysis of contagion within a "money center system", where banks in the "periphery" are linked
to one "core bank" but not to each other. They show that there are parameter constellations
under which the failure of a periphery bank does not lead to contagion, whereas the failure of
the "core bank" does.
Another part of the literature that investigates financial stability are empirical studies that use
supervisory data to analyze the danger of domino effects within a banking system (e.g. van
Lelyveld and Liedorp (2006), Upper and Worms (2004), Wells (2004), Furfine (1999), Sheldon
and Maurer (1998)). As a lot of detailed data on interbank exposures are necessary but often
not available, assumptions such as maximum entropy are made concerning the structure of these
exposures. This means that banks are assumed to spread their interbank claims as equally as

possible among their counterparties. However, it is likely that, under the maximum entropy
assumption, results are biased. In his summary of the analysis of interbank contagion, Upper
(2007) states that maximum entropy assumptions tend to underestimate the incidence but over-
estimate the severity of contagion. Mistrulli (2007) investigates interbank contagion using actual
Italian interbank data and compares his findings with an analysis using the maximum entropy
assumption. He finds that, for most parameter constellations, the maximum entropy assump-
tion tends to underestimate the extent of contagion. There are, however, also some parameter
constellations (in particular a high loss given default) where the maximum entropy assumption
overestimates the scope of contagion.
Cifuentes et al. (2005) extend a contagion model of domino effects by simulations that include
contagion due to liquidity problems. Within their simulations they use a clearing algorithm
developed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001).2 The analysis of pure domino effects is also extended
by Chan-Lau (2010) and Espinosa and Sol´
e (2010) by additionally considering contagion due to
banks' refinancing problems and due to risk transfers. Also, the impact of market and funding
liquidity risk on the stability of a financial network is investigated by Aikman et al. (2009).
In recent years there has been a growing literature which uses theory of complex networks to
describe real-world financial systems and simulate the effects of potentially dangerous events.
For example, Boss et al. (2004) analyze the network topology of the Austrian interbank market.
Iori et al. (2008) apply network theory to describe the Italian overnight money market. Haldane
(2009) provides a characterization of the world's financial network. Additionally, Gai and Kapa-
dia (2010), as well as Nier et al. (2008), use random graphs to analyze the danger of contagion
dependent on certain characteristics of the financial system by simulation. Gai and Kapadia
(2010) find that for a high connectivity of the network, the probability that contagion occurs
is low but the impact if contagion occurs is high. Nier et al. (2008) find out by parameterized
simulation some non-linearities between certain parameter values and financial stability. Con-
trary to most of the empirical literature, where one special financial system is considered to test
the danger of contagion, simulation-based work instead tries to find out the main characteristics
that make a financial system especially vulnerable to contagion.
As, up to now, only few studies exist about the detailed structure of real-world financial net-
works, this paper considers several stylized structures and investigates their impact on financial

has positive equity value or all nodes have positive operating cash flows) there exists a unique fixed point that
describes the clearing payment vector of the financial system.

stability by simulation. This paper builds on the empirical literature that uses entropy methods
to construct and characterize interbank linkages as well as on literature that tries to simulate the
danger of contagion according to certain characteristics of the financial system, in particular the
matrix of interbank exposures. For example, it extends the work of Mistrulli (2007) in such a
way that not only one matrix is compared to the maximum entropy solution but a great variety
of randomly generated matrices with different network structures. For the first time, a large set
of valid interbank matrices is constructed by a random generator and then characterized accord-
ing to certain properties, such as entropy, relative entropy to the maximum entropy solution or
connectivity.
Additionally, this paper differs from Nier et al. (2008) in the sense that, first, balance sheets
are constructed and, as a second step, the liability matrix is generated, which is, besides row
and column sums of the matrix, independent from banks' balance sheets. Thus, stability results
obtained in this paper can be attributed purely to changes in the liability matrix.
Furthermore, results can be interpreted as an extension to the theoretical literature about the
impact of certain network patterns on contagion. Up to now the focus has been exclusively on
the completeness and interconnectedness of interbank networks (see Allen and Gale (2000)). In
this context, banks are modelled as completely homogeneous, especially with all interbank expo-
sures being the same size. This work, however, investigates a large number of possible matrices
with various possible specifications of interbank exposures and can thus have an additional focus
on the distribution of claims within the network for given completeness and interconnectedness.
Results of this paper show that the distribution of interbank claims within the network is an
important parameter affecting the stability of the network.
Within this paper, pure domino effects between banks are examined. To be more precise, it is
investigated what happens if one bank fails and therefore a part of other banks' claims to that
bank also fail. It is then possible that creditor banks lose all their capital and therefore fail as
well. In the worst case, there are subsequent rounds of failures until the whole system defaults.
Of course, this is just one channel through which interbank contagion can occur. Further chan-
nels can be contagion due to liquidity problems because of correlated asset portfolios among
banks, or contagion due to refinancing problems affecting banks. As a starting point, however,
to be able to exclusively focus on the effect of the structure of the liability matrix on the stability
of the financial network, only domino effects are considered.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the basic structure of the financial system is
defined. Section 3 explains in more detail how interbank liability matrices are created and char-
3
acterized. Simulations of domino effects are run and results are presented in Section 4 which is
divided into the investigation of complete networks (Section 4.1), random graphs (Section 4.2)
and money center models (Section 4.3). Section 5 summarizes the main findings.
2 Structure of the financial system
The financial system is modelled as a network of N nodes where nodes 1 to N - 1 are financial
institutions (referred to as banks in the following) and node N constitutes the external (non-
banking) sector (such as households or non-financial companies). These nodes are linked by
directed edges that depict direct claims/obligations between the financial institutions and the
external sector. For some of the subsequent financial networks modelled, it is assumed that there
are two different types of banks, core banks and periphery banks, that are equal within their
groups but differ across groups with regard to their connectivity and size, respectively. The
distribution of assets among the two types of banks is given by a concentration ratio CR, that
denotes the share of total bank assets that core banks hold.
Bank i's balance sheet has the following structure:
AIB
i
+ AE
i
= LIB
i
+ LE
i
+ Ei
(1)
 i {1, ..., N - 1}.
Interbank assets AIB
i
(liabilities LIB
i
) are claims (obligations) between banks. External assets
AE
i
are interpreted as credit to the external sector. External liabilities LE
i
denote obligations
of banks to the external sector such as customer deposits. The balance sheet is completed by
equity Ei
that is given by the difference of bank i's total assets Ai
(= AIB
i
+ AE
i
) and liabilities
Li
(= LIB
i
+ LE
i
).
The (risk-unweighted) equity ratio, which is presumed to be equal across banks, is given by:3
r =
Ei
AIB
i
+ AE
i
(2)
 i {1, ..., N - 1}.
The financial system is characterized by the total amount of banks' assets Abanks, as well as
the total amount of banks' interbank assets AIB. The ratio of interbank to total assets in the

way.

financial system is defined as:
 =
AIB
Abanks
(3)
Banks' total assets, total liabilities and equity of this stylized financial system can be perfectly
described by the total amount of banks' assets Abanks, the total number of banks N - 1, the
number of core banks ncore
, the concentration ratio CR and banks' equity ratio r.
The direct connections between the nodes can be illustrated by a liability matrix:

with Li,j
being the obligation of bank i to bank j (i, j {1, ..., N - 1}). Because banks and
the external sector do not lend to themselves, Li,i
= 0  i {1, .., N}. Additionally, as banks
are linked on both sides of their balance sheets, it is easy to interpret row sums (= total lia-
bilities) and column sums (= total assets) of the matrix. The elements of the last row, LN,i
( i {1, .., N - 1}), are equal to banks' external assets AE
i
. Thus, the sum of the elements
in the last row of the matrix is equivalent to banks' total external assets, which are given by
(1 - ) · Abanks. The elements of the last column, Li,N
( i {1, .., N - 1}), are equal to banks'
external liabilities LE
i
. Hence, the sum of the elements in the last column of the matrix (AN
) is
equivalent to the total amount of external liabilities of banks. Furthermore, it is assumed that
the system is closed, i.e. there is no lending / borrowing to somewhere outside the network.
Technically, this means that the sum of row sums of the liability matrix has to be equal to the
sum of column sums. Thus, total external liabilities of banks (or total assets of the external sec-
tor AN
) can be calculated by the difference between total liabilities in the system (the external
sector included) and total assets of banks.4
4In the aggregate AN , it is not considered that the external sector might be the owner of the banks. Thus,
AN only comprises the amount of banks' liabilities that is provided by the external sector.

3 Creation and characterization of liability matrices
Regulators often face the problem of limited data. Sometimes only the row sums and column
sums of the liability matrix are observable. At least it is quite common for some elements of the
liability matrix to be missing. As already mentioned, this problem is often surrounded by using
the assumption that banks spread their exposures as evenly as possible, which is equivalent to
maximizing the entropy of the (normalized) liability matrix.5 However, using matrices under the
maximum entropy assumption tends to bias the results.
The approach of this paper is to abstract from generating only one matrix using the maximum
entropy assumption but to create, for given row and column sums, a large number of valid liability
matrices by a random generator. This is done in two steps: first, a random number Lrand
ij
, that
does not exceed the number of total liabilities in the system Ltotal (or total assets in the system
Atotal, respectively), is assigned to each off-diagonal element. This random number is drawn
from a uniform distribution with Lrand
ij
0, Ltotal ,  i = j, where RSgoal(i) is the aspired
row sum and CSgoal(j) is the aspired column sum associated to this element. The interval the
random number is drawn from seems at first more restrictive than it is. A reduction/expansion
of the interval of the uniform distribution to some smaller/higher upper bound does not change
the simulation results. To make the matrix fit exactly, the RAS algorithm is applied:6 In a first
step, each element of the matrix is multiplied by the ratio of the aspired row sum (RSgoal(i))
and the actual row sum (rs(i)).
Lij
= Lij
·
RSgoal(i)
rs(i)
(4)
In a second step, each element of the matrix is multiplied by the ratio of the aspired column sum
(CSgoal(j)) and the actual column sum (cs(j)).
Lij
= Lij
·
CSgoal(j)
cs(j)
(5)
By repeating these two steps sufficiently often, a matrix with elements that fit to the aspired
row and column sums will be generated.
The RAS algorithm shows some interesting features. First, restrictions to connectivity can be
imposed by setting certain elements equal to zero. These elements will remain zero after run-
ning the algorithm. Second, given certain random starting values within the matrix, the RAS

Appendix 1.

algorithm yields a unique solution, independent of the "position" of a certain bank within the
matrix. The algorithm is also robust to a transposition of the matrix. Third, the randomly
generated starting values determine a certain correlation structure within the matrix. The RAS
algorithm determines a unique solution that matches the given correlation structure as well as
possible and that fulfills row and column sum restrictions. However, there are cases where the
RAS algorithm does not provide a valid solution. This happens especially when too many zero
restrictions are imposed. Within the simulations, randomly generated matrices that do not fit
are dropped.
After liability matrices are generated, they have to be characterized. As the aim of this pa-
per is to investigate the stability of the financial system dependent on the matrix of interbank
exposures, the focus is, for the following characterizations, on the (N - 1 × N - 1) matrix that
covers the interbank market. It is created by deleting the last row and the last column of the
(N × N) liability matrix L. As a next step, there has to be some normalization of matrices
because entropy measures have to be applied on probability fields. This is done by dividing
all elements by the total amount of interbank liabilities. As a result, elements of normalized
matrices add up to 1 and thus can be treated as probabilities. In the following, all normalized
elements are marked with a superscript p and written in lower case letters.
After normalization, the next step is to characterize matrices according to the following measures:
· Entropy: In information theory, entropy is a measure for information and can, for example,
be explained in the context of search problems. To be more precise, entropy is a lower bound
of the average path length from the root to the leaves of a binary search tree. Thus, entropy
is a lower bound to the average number of yes/no questions that is needed to obtain full
information. The more equal the probability distribution of the elements in the search
space, the more questions are on average needed to obtain the desired element and, hence,
the higher entropy is. The more unequal the probability distribution, the lower entropy is.
The lowest entropy (equal to zero) can be obtained when one element in the search space
occurs with probability 1 and the other elements with probability 0, i.e. the most unequal
distribution of elements occurs.
This entropy measure can be reinterpreted to quantify the inequality of the distribution
of claims of a liability matrix. Using the normalization mentioned above, the elements
of the matrix can be seen as realizations of a probability distribution of elements within
a search space that need not be defined more specifically. Entropy measures the amount
7
of information inherent in these realizations and is maximal if banks spread their claims
/ obligations as equally as possible. The higher the entropy, the more equally interbank
claims are distributed for given row and column sums. The entropy is calculated by:7
ENT = -
N-1
i=1
N-1
j=1
lp
ij
· ln lp
ij
(6)
with 0 · ln(0) := 0.
· Relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) to maximum entropy solution: The
relative entropy is a measure for the difference between two probability distributions. Given
two normalized liability matrices Xp (in this case the maximum entropy solution X, see
Appendix 1, with last row and last column deleted and normalized by the total amount of
interbank liabilities) and Lp (in this case a valid normalized liability matrix generated by
random generator), the relative entropy is given by:
RE =
N-1
i=1
N-1
j=1
lp
ij
ln
lp
ij
xp
ij
(7)
with 0 · ln(0) := 0 and 0 · ln(0
0
) := 0.
A higher value of RE denotes a greater difference between the two distributions. In the
financial system modelled here, a higher relative entropy means a greater distance to the
probability distribution of the maximum entropy solution and thus a more unequal distri-
bution of claims among banks. As long as the relative entropy to the maximum entropy
solution is considered and banks are assumed to be of equal size, there is a negative linear
relationship between the entropy of a matrix and its relative entropy to the maximum
entropy solution.8
· Connectivity: The connectivity of the financial system can be described by the probability
that a directed link between two banks exists. While constructing the liability matrix of
a random graph, each off-diagonal interbank element is (independently) given a certain
positive real number with probability p and 0 with probability 1 - p. This probability p is
called Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability. However, during implementation one has to be careful that,
7When applying the entropy measure in the context of binary search trees, log2 is used. However, in economics
literature it is more common to use the natural logarithm. This is equivalent to multiplying a constant factor.
8The general derivation of this linear relationship is provided in Appendix 2. Simulation results confirm this
theoretical finding.
8
for given starting values (including zeros with a certain probability), the RAS algorithm
is able to find a valid solution of matrix entries. This problem increases with decreasing
connectivity. The algorithm used in this paper simply drops matrices that are not valid.
4 Simulation of domino effects
Within this paper, pure domino effects are modelled dependent on characteristics of the inter-
bank liability structure.9 As a trigger event, one bank fails.10 Assuming a certain loss given
default (LGD), creditor banks lose a share of their claims to the defaulting bank.11 If this lost
share is larger than the creditor bank's equity, the creditor bank also fails. If one or more banks
fail due to the first failure, the next round starts with banks losing additional shares of their
claims to failing banks. Thus, a bank fails if:
Interbank exposures to failed banks  LGD > Equity
For a large number of randomly generated matrices, it is investigated how many banks fail
on average, after the failure of one bank, dependent on the characteristics of the liability matrix
mentioned in Section 3. To be more precise, it is calculated which percentage of total assets of
the banking system belongs to failing banks, i.e. which percentage of total bank assets is affected
by bank failure.12 Note, however, that this does not mean that all assets affected by bank failure
actually default. This depends on the value of the loss given default.
To depict the results graphically, value intervals of characteristics have to be defined. One pos-
sibility to do this is to adjust interval size according to the number of observations. After the
random generation of matrices, they are sorted according to their characterization values, and
then intervals are defined with each interval having the same number of observations.
The network simulations are run several times and for different banks failing initially to check
9For advantages and disadvantages of modelling domino effects, see Upper (2007).
10This is a rather simple way to model a shock on the financial system. A more sophisticated approach is, for
example, used by Elsinger et al. (2006), who apply aggregate macroeconomic shocks to test for the resilience of
the Austrian interbank market.
11In this paper, a constant, exogenously given LGD is assumed. An obvious extension is to endogenize the
LGD as, for example, in Degryse and Nguyen (2007).
12An alternative target value to measure the harm of interbank contagion is the loss of the external sector,
which can be computed easily within this model.

how robust these results are with respect to sample changes and to changes in the trigger event.
4.1 Complete networks
To begin with, simulations are run for complete networks, i.e. it is assumed that there exists
a directed link from each node to all other nodes. The parameter values used for subsequent

= 10, CR = 1 (i.e. all banks are the same size),
 = 0.3, r = 0.06 and LGD = 0.5. The following figures show, for 50, 000 randomly generated
matrices of interbank exposures, the average percentage of total assets of the banking system af-
fected by bank failures in a network with 11 nodes (10 banks and the external sector) dependent
on entropy (Figure 1) and relative entropy to the maximum entropy solution (Figure 2), each
color representing a randomly generated sample.
From Figure 1 it can be seen that an increase in entropy leads to a lower average percentage

Entropy
% of total assets of banking system affected on average
Figure 1: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy
of banks' assets affected. Under the assumption that all banks are of equal size, the average
number of bank defaults dependent on entropy can be derived easily by multiplying the average
percentage of banks' assets affected by failure by the total number of banks (in this case, 10).
Hence, the more equally banks spread their claims, the fewer institutions default on average.
These results suggest that, within a complete network and for the parameter values given above,
shocks are absorbed best if banks diversify their (credit) risk exposures well. The results, as well
as all subsequent simulation results, are robust to changes in the sample and to changes in the
bank that fails first.

Relative entropy
% of total assets of banking system affected on average
Figure 2: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on relative entropy
and average percentage of banks' assets affected, yields an inverse result compared to Figure 1:
The higher the relative entropy, the higher the percentage of banks' assets affected and therefore
the higher the average number of bank failures. Thus, because of the negative linear relationship
between entropy and relative entropy shown in Appendix 2, Figure 2 also confirms that a more
equal distribution of claims leads to a more stable system.
Up to now, the impact of the distribution of claims on financial stability can be summed up
as follows:
Result 1: In a complete network, for the parameter values given above,13 a liability matrix
with an equal distribution of interbank exposures (a high entropy or a low relative entropy to
the maximum entropy solution, respectively) leads to a more stable system than a liability matrix
with an unequal distribution of interbank exposures.
4.2 Random graphs
A connectivity of 100% is rather unrealistic. Thus, some network has to be designed that omits
some directed links within the financial system. One option in this context is to model random
graphs.
13In the sections below, it is specified in more detail for which parameter values these results hold.
11
Concerning completeness and interconnectedness of the network only and assuming that banks
are completely homogeneous, especially with a completely homogeneous asset / liability struc-
ture, subsequent results should be expected according to the theoretical findings of Allen and
Gale (2000). They examine three types of networks that are displayed in Figure 3. The complete
and perfectly interconnected network (Figure 1 in Allen and Gale) is equivalent to a random
graph with an Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability of 100%. In this case, the possibility that contagion
occurs is rather low because the more complete a financial system, the greater is the potential
for risk diversification. With decreasing connectivity, the network structure moves towards sys-
tems that are still highly interconnected but also incomplete (equivalent to Figure 2 in Allen
and Gale). Allen and Gale show that these systems are more vulnerable to contagion. With
connectivity decreasing further, the network structure becomes equivalent to the disconnected
system in Figure 3 in Allen and Gale. This disconnection can limit the extent of contagion.
Hence there is a non-monotonic relationship between completeness of the network and financial
stability.
In the following simulations, the degree of disconnection is measured by the average number of
strongly connected components across all matrices in a sample. Within a strongly connected
component, every bank can be reached by every other bank. This does not mean that there
are direct links between all banks as in a complete network. It is sufficient that there exists a
directed path between all nodes. If the graph contains only one strongly connected component,
the failure of one bank can (potentially after several rounds of contagion) cause the failure of
all other banks. If there is more than one strongly connected component, however, it is possible
that the failure of one bank cannot cause the failure of all other banks because not all banks
can be reached by the failing bank. Hence, the higher the average number of strongly connected
components for a given Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability, the more disconnected is the system.
As mentioned above, the analysis of Allen and Gale is based on a banking system with completely
homogeneous banks with a completely equal asset / liability structure. Within this simulation, in
addition to completeness and interconnectedness, a third aspect is introduced into the analysis:
the distribution of claims within the system.

4.2.1 Varying connectivity
In the following, the default algorithm is run for different values of the Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probabil-
ity, all other parameter values kept equal to those of Section 4.1. Each off-diagonal element of
the liability matrix that denotes an interbank claim / obligation is set equal to zero with this
probability.14 As for certain zero constellations, the RAS algorithm is not able to find a valid
solution; matrices that do not fit are dropped. Furthermore, matrices where the actual share
of existing links to total possible links deviates more than 0.02 from the desired connectivity
are also dropped. Thus, only matrices that fit exactly to desired row and column sums and to
desired connectivity are used for the analysis.
To capture the degree of disconnection of the randomly generated network, the number of strongly
connected components is computed for each graph using an algorithm developed by Tarjan
(1972). After generating a large number of matrices, the average number of strongly connected
components for a given Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability is calculated. It turns out that the system starts
to become disconnected for p = 0.5 with an average number of strongly connected components
of around 1.03. For p = 0.3, more randomly generated graphs are not perfectly interconnected
any more, which yields an average number of strongly connected components of about 1.80. The
degree of disconnection jumps up for p = 0.1, where the average number of strongly connected
components is around 9.07.
All the following simulations are implemented by generating 40, 000 to 50, 000 matrices for
14Alternatively, the whole graph (including the node that denotes the external sector) can be modelled as a
random graph. The aim of this paper is, however, to investigate the impact of the network topology of the
interbank market on financial stability. Furthermore, it is certainly more realistic to assume that all banks have
connections to the external sector.

for an Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability of 10% to 100% (with 10%-steps) using the same parameter val-
ues as in the previous section.
As a first step, to capture the effect of completeness and interconnectedness on financial sta-
bility, the average percentage of bank assets affected by failures dependent on the connectivity
of the financial system is calculated. Figure 4 shows the average percentage of banks' assets
affected by failures dependent on the median entropy for a given Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability. It
can be seen that a complete network (i.e. with p = 100%) leads on average to matrices that are
characterized by high entropy. With decreasing connectivity, entropy also decreases, meaning
that claims are distributed more unequally (according to Table 1, there is a high correlation of
0.94 between entropy and the Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability). Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that with
decreasing completeness (i.e. a decreasing Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability) the average percentage of
assets affected by bank failure rises. This is in line with the finding of Allen and Gale that an
incomplete but perfectly interconnected network leads to a less stable financial system than a
complete network. The effect appearing in Allen and Gale's disconnected network can be ob-
served for p = 10%. For p = 10%, the average percentage of assets affected (and therefore the
average number of bank failures) is much lower than for p = 30% which can be explained by the
large rise in the average number of strongly connected components from around 1.80 to around
9.07.
These results shown in Figure 4 can be obtained on average if networks are exclusively charac-
terized by their completeness and interconnectedness. However, the effect of the structure of the
financial system on financial stability can be analyzed in more detail by additionally considering
the effect of the distribution of claims for a given connectivity. Intervals of characteristics are, as
in Section 4.1, defined in a way that the number of observations is the same within all intervals.

liability matrix with a higher entropy leads to a lower average percentage of assets affected by
bank failure and therefore a lower average number of bank failures. However, with the 100%
connectivity assumption, only rather high values for entropy can be generated. Inserting zero
15
off-diagonal "interbank" elements into the matrix with 10% probability, which is equivalent to
p = 90%, generates matrices with a lower entropy. The negative correlation between bank failures
and entropy still holds for p = 90%. With decreasing connectivity, matrices with an even lower
entropy can be created. The negative correlation between entropy and average bank failures,
however, becomes weaker and turns into a positive correlation. This means that for a given low
Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability (e.g. p = 50%, p = 30% or p = 10%), a comparatively high entropy
leads on average to more banks defaulting than a comparatively low entropy.
An interpretation for this observation is that, for a high connectivity, an equal distribution of
interbank claims is the best shock absorber due to credit risk diversification, whereas an unequal
distribution of claims increases the probability that there is a second-round effect after the failure
of one bank. On the contrary, when connectivity is low, the failure of one bank is very likely
to cause second-round effects because the average amount of interbank exposures to the few
connected banks is very high. Hence, the more equal the distribution to the few other banks, the
higher the probability that all these banks fail because there are not enough counterparties to
diversify the losses induced by the shock. On the other hand, the more unequal the distribution
to the few other banks, the higher the probability that not all of these banks fail and therefore
the average number of failures is smaller in this case.
Thus, a change in the average percentage of assets in the banking sector affected by failure (i.e.
a change in the average number of bank failures) is not just due to a change in connectivity
but can also be due to a change in the distribution of interbank claims. For example, though
the overall average number of banks failing is higher for a connectivity of 30% compared to a
connectivity of 50% (see Figure 4), a system with a very unequal distribution of interbank claims
(low entropy) and 30% connectivity is more stable than a system with a rather equal distribution
of interbank claims (high entropy) and 50% connectivity (see Figure 5). Also, a system with a
very equal distribution of interbank claims (high entropy) and 90% connectivity is more stable
than a network with 100% connectivity and a very unequal distribution of interbank claims (low
entropy).
Thus, by additionally considering the distribution of claims within the system, it can be seen
that a complete network can be more unstable than an incomplete but perfectly interconnected
network. This finding extends the work of Allen and Gale in a way that results could change if
interbank claims are allowed to be heterogeneous.
Figure 6 and 7 show the average number of bank failures dependent on the relative entropy to the
maximum entropy solution. As entropy and relative entropy are exactly negatively correlated

The results of this paragraph can be summarized as follows:
Result 2: Financial stability does not only depend on the completeness and interconnected-
ness of the network but also on the distribution of claims within the system.
Result 3: For the parameter values given above,15 the sign of the correlation between the
equality of the distribution of claims (measured by entropy and relative entropy) and financial
stability changes with decreasing completeness of the network. For high completeness (and high
interconnectedness) an equal distribution of claims leads to the most stable system. For lower
completeness (but still high interconnectedness) the positive correlation between entropy and
number of banks failing weakens. For very low completeness (and low interconnectedness) a
more unequal distribution of interbank claims leads to a more stable system.
As long as banks are assumed to be of equal size, the characterization of matrices by entropy and
relative entropy yields exactly the same results. Thus, all the following investigations are only
made dependent on entropy. As a next step, some sensitivity analysis is done by varying one
parameter (LGD, equity ratio or ratio of interbank assets to total assets in the banking system),
as well as connectivity, and fixing all other parameters at their benchmark value set in Section
4.1.
4.2.2 Varying loss given default and connectivity
Figure 8 shows the not very surprising result that, for a given connectivity, the average percentage
of assets affected by bank failure (and thus also the average number of bank failures) increases
with an increasing loss given default. An interesting observation is that for a high LGD (= 100%)
the effect of a disconnected system (equivalent to Figure 3 in Allen and Gale) is already visible
between p = 50% and p = 30%. Starting from p = 50% the average number of bank defaults
decreases with decreasing connectivity. Hence, the impact of the disconnection of the financial
system becomes more important for high rates of LGD where the average number of bank defaults
tends to be very high.
Figure 9 shows that a LGD of 100% leads to a positive correlation between assets affected by
bank failure and entropy, even for a high connectivity of the network. A LGD of 30% leads
15In the sections below, it is specified in more detail for which parameter values these results hold.

to a negative correlation between assets affected by bank failure and entropy, even for a low
connectivity (up to p = 30%) of the network. An explanation for this observation is that a high
LGD makes a system vulnerable to interbank contagion as a high share of claims to the failing
banks defaults. Thus, it can be assumed that contagion occurs with certainty. In this case, it
is better to have a relatively unequal distribution of interbank exposures so that only few banks
are hit by a second-round effect of contagion. For a low LGD, the system is rather resilient to
interbank contagion. In this case, second-round effects only occur if interbank exposures are
distributed very unequally, i.e. interbank claims are not well diversified among counterparties.
4.2.3 Varying equity ratio and connectivity
Figure 10 shows, not surprisingly, that a lower equity ratio leads, for a given Erd¨
os-R´
enyi prob-
ability, to a higher average number of bank assets affected by failure. Again, the impact of
the disconnection of the financial system becomes more important for parameter constellations
where the average number of bank defaults tends to be very high, i.e. for low equity ratios.
Looking at the effect of the distribution of claims for given connectivity in Figure 11, it can be
seen that for an equity ratio of 9% the correlation of entropy and percentage of assets affected
by bank failure is negative for all values of p (except p = 10%). For an equity ratio of 3% the
correlation is always positive. Similar to the variation of LGD, systems with high equity ratios
are more stable with an equal distribution of claims because second-round effects only occur

4.2.4 Varying ratio of interbank to total assets and connectivity
Additionally, the ratio of interbank assets to total assets  can be varied. Figure 12 shows that
a higher ratio of interbank assets to total assets leads, for a given Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability, to a
higher average percentage of assets affected by bank failure. This is not surprising because, for
a given equity ratio and LGD, banks become more vulnerable to the default of a neighboring
bank. The reason is that, on average, the bilateral exposure per counterparty increases with an
increasing ratio of interbank to total assets. Furthermore, for high numbers of bank failures (i.e.
high numbers of ) the effect of a disconnected system is again already visible for an Erd¨
os-R´
enyi
probability below 50%.
Figure 13 shows that the correlation between entropy and average percentage of assets affected
by failure changes from positive to negative at an Erd¨
os-R´
enyi probability of around 70%, inde-
pendent of the value of . Thus, contrary to the variation of LGD and r, there is no influence
of  on the correlation between entropy and average number of banks defaults.16 However, one

result is that high values of LGD or low values of r lead to a positive correlation between entropy and the average

Thus, not the same entropy intervals can be compared when investigating the average percentage
of bank assets affected by failure for different values of .
Paragraphs 4.2.2 to 4.2.4 can be summarized by the following result:
Result 4: For a given total amount of interbank assets, the sign of the correlation between
the equality of the distribution of claims (entropy) and average percentage of bank assets af-
fected by failure (or average number of banks defaulting, respectively) tends to be positive for
parameters that make a system vulnerable to interbank contagion (i.e. a high LGD and low
equity ratios). On the other hand, the sign of the correlation tends to be negative for parameters
that make the system resilient to interbank contagion (i.e. a low LGD and high equity ratios).
For intermediate parameter values, the sign of the correlation between equality of the distribu-
tion of claims and average number of banks defaulting changes from negative to positive with
percentage of assets affected, and low values of LGD or high values of r lead to a negative correlation, independent
of . Thus, a variation of LGD and r changes the correlation between entropy and average percentage of assets
affected by failure; a variation of , however, does not.

In further simulations, additional parameters are varied. At first, the total number of assets
was changed. This, however, does not alter the results as relative numbers (e.g. equity ratio
or ratio of interbank assets to total assets) do not change. Increasing the number of banks in
the system makes it (all other variables kept equal) less vulnerable to the failure of one bank as
the average amount of bilateral exposures per counterparty decreases with an increasing number
of counterparties. Furthermore, these simulations were run for "extreme" parameter values, i.e.
parameters that all make a financial system very unstable (high LGD, low equity ratio and high
share of interbank assets to total assets) or stable, respectively. The results confirmed the main
findings summarized in result 4.

4.3 Money center models
The analysis of the impact of the distribution of claims on financial stability in random graphs
leads to some interesting results. It is, however, questionable, whether a random graph is a good
description of real world financial networks. In the literature, it is sometimes stated that a more
adequate model of a financial system is a scale-free network (see, for example, Boss et al. (2004)
and Soram¨
aki et al. (2006)). Furthermore, some recent studies prefer to model financial systems
as (multiple) money center systems (see e.g. Craig and von Peter (2010)), where few large core
banks are strongly interconnected (i.e. they form a complete network) and a larger number of
small banks in the periphery are only connected to one core bank but not to other banks in the
periphery. Figure 14 shows an example of a money center model (without the external sector).

The interbank part of this adjacency matrix, i.e. the (N - 1) × (N - 1) matrix that is ob-
tained when deleting the last row and the last column of L, can be written in block matrix
form:17
LIB =





1
| 2
- - -
3
| 4





By assumption, the money center model has to follow certain patterns. First, all core banks
are strongly connected to each other. Thus, all off-diagonal elements of the top left corner of the
adjacency matrix LIB (1) have to be equal to one. Second, each bank in the periphery is linked
to exactly one money center bank in both directions. Thus, the top right corner (2) has exactly
one non-zero element per column and the bottom left corner of the adjacency matrix (3) is the
exactly transposed version of the top right corner. Third, banks in the periphery are not linked
to each other. Hence, the bottom right corner (4) contains only zeros. By construction, the
strongly connected component always includes all nodes in the system.
17The way this money center system is constructed is very similar to the "block-model approach" of Craig and
von Peter (2010). The conditions a money center system has to fulfill are, however, stronger in this paper.
25
After constructing the adjacency matrix, the edges of the graph obtain weights that are, similar
to the case of the random graph, created by a random generator. For given row and column
sums, elements are again adjusted by using the RAS algorithm.
4.3.1 Varying the number of core banks and concentration ratio
At first, the stability of a money center model is investigated by varying two main parameters
that characterize its pattern: the number of core banks ncore
and the concentration ratio CR.
To create a more reasonable ratio of core banks to periphery banks, the number of banks in
the financial system is increased to 15, i.e. N = 16. Remaining parameters are set at their
benchmark values, i.e. LGD = 0.5, r = 0.06 and  = 0.3. Total assets in the banking system
are again set at Abanks = 1, 000 and each simulation is run for a sample of 50, 000 randomly
generated matrices. While for the random graph it does not matter which bank fails first, for
the money center model it is assumed that a core bank fails.18 Figures 15 to 18 show the average
percentage of total assets that are affected by bank failure for ncore
= 5 to ncore
= 2. For
each number of core banks the concentration ratio is varied from CR = 0.99 (core banks hold
almost all assets in the banking system) to CR = 0.4 (core banks hold 40% of total assets in the
banking system). The lower bound of the concentration ratio is set in such a way that, for all
values of ncore
investigated, it cannot happen that core banks have smaller balance sheet totals
than periphery banks.
Not surprisingly, entropy decreases with an increasing concentration ratio as a higher concen-
tration of assets among few core banks implies a more unequal distribution of claims within the
financial system. Furthermore, for a given number of core banks, the average percentage of as-
sets affected by bank failure increases with the concentration ratio. One reason is that the total
amount of assets of the bank that fails first, and therefore the initial percentage of assets affected
by bank failure, is higher. But this is not the only effect. With increasing size of core banks
compared to banks in the periphery (i.e. a higher CR), and all other variables kept equal, the
average weights of the links between core banks increase in the liability matrices generated. Thus
the amount of interbank assets between core banks becomes larger on average, which makes core
banks more vulnerable to interbank contagion. And the more core banks fail, the more banks in
the periphery are on average affected by domino effects.
Comparing the stability of the financial system by varying the number of core banks ncore
it can

system is more stable than in the case of a core bank failing.
26
be seen that, all other parameters kept equal, the stability of the financial system increases with
an increasing number of core banks. This effect is again due to the size of the core banks. For a
given concentration ratio, the size of the core banks decreases with an increasing number of core
banks. Thus, the average amount of interbank assets between core banks also becomes smaller
and the probability that domino effects between core banks occur, is reduced.
Hence, the main result of this paragraph is:

center system makes it more unstable on average.
4.3.2 Comparison to random graphs
Additionally, the stability of a money center system is compared to the stability of a random
graph. As a benchmark, the investigation of the stability of random graphs with the same system
size (in terms of total assets) and the same number of banks as in the money center system is

banks have homogeneous balance sheet totals and are linked randomly with a certain probability.
The money center system is interlinked according to the description in Section 4.3.
However, one has to be careful when setting the parameter values for the money center system.
Within a random graph, the average amount of bilateral interbank exposures (over the whole
sample of generated matrices) is the same between all banks. In a money center model, though,
if the concentration ratio is chosen too low (or the number of core banks is chosen too high),
i.e. core banks do not have a balance sheet total that is large enough compared to periphery
banks, the assumed network topology of the money center model leads to interbank connections
where core banks have less exposures to each other than to banks in the periphery. The reason
is that periphery banks have all their interbank exposures to one core bank by assumption. To
obtain a valid liability matrix for given balance sheet totals, the result is a very low weight on
interbank exposures among core banks. This does not fit to realistic banking systems. Thus,
in the following simulations, it is assumed that the average amount of bilateral interbank assets
each core bank holds against another core bank is at least as high as the average amount of bilat-
eral interbank assets a core bank holds against a periphery bank. This amounts to a minimum
concentration ratio of CR = 0.25 for ncore
= 2, CR = 0.35 for ncore
= 3, CR = 0.4 for ncore
= 4
and CR = 0.45 for ncore
= 5.19
19These results are obtained by calculating the average amount of bilateral interbank assets between two core
banks and between a core and a periphery bank by simulation for different values of CR (in steps of 0.05). The
29
Figures 19 to 22 show that (for the same values of N, Abanks, , LGD and r) the random graph
is always more stable on average than the money center system with the minimum concentration
ratio derived above.20
Several reasons for this result can be mentioned. First, in the money center model, the initial
percentage of assets affected by bank failure is larger than in the random graph. The reason
is that, for the given minimum concentration ratio, core banks in the money center model are
always larger than banks in a random graph. Second, a large balance sheet total of the failing
core bank implies on average a high amount of interbank claims defaulting in the first round.
Thus, the initial shock is larger compared to a random graph. Third, among core banks there are
only limited possibilities of risk diversification, as they are only linked to the other core banks
and to few periphery banks. Additionally, there is no sufficient risk diversification possible for
periphery banks that hold all their claims against one core bank. Fourth, money center models
are always strongly connected by assumption, i.e. they have only one strongly connected com-
ponent. Hence, domino effects can never be curtailed by disconnection of the financial system.

Thus, to summarize the main findings of this paragraph, it can be said that:
Result 6: Under the assumption that the average amount of bilateral interbank assets be-
tween two core banks is at least as high as between a core and a periphery bank, a money center
system with asset concentration among core banks is, in all previously conducted simulations,
less stable on average than a system of banks with homogeneous size that follows a random
graph.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, the impact of the structure of the interbank liabilities matrix on financial stability
is analyzed. After characterizing the financial system according to the number of banks, total
assets in the banking system, equity ratio, the ratio of interbank to total assets and loss given
default, a large number of valid interbank liability matrices is created by random generator for
given row and column sums. Thus, for the first time, interbank contagion is investigated for
a large sample of interbank matrices. These matrices are then characterized by entropy and
relative entropy to the maximum entropy solution, which constitute measures of the equality of
the distribution of interbank exposures. This procedure makes it possible to investigate financial
stability dependent on how equally interbank exposures are distributed. As a next step, domino
effects resulting from the default of one bank are modelled. As long as banks are assumed to
32
be of equal size (to be able to only focus on the effects of the structure of the liability matrix),
it does not matter which bank fails first. Additionally, as a large number of valid matrices is
generated, results do not depend on the sample of matrices.
The first simulations are conducted for complete networks and "intermediate" parameter values.
The main result is that a more equal distribution of interbank claims leads to a more stable
financial system.
These results, however, change if an incomplete network is considered. Starting with a random
graph and, again, "intermediate" parameter values, it can be seen that the sign of the correlation
between equality of distribution of claims and percentage of assets affected by bank failures
changes with decreasing connectivity. Furthermore, a crucial result of these simulations is that
not only completeness and interconnectedness of a financial network, as investigated theoretically
in Allen and Gale (2000), matters, but also the distribution of claims within the financial network.
In this paper, cases can be shown where, contrary to the findings of Allen and Gale, a complete
network (with an unequal distribution of claims) is less stable than an incomplete but perfectly
interconnected network (with an equal distribution of claims).
As a next step, further sensitivity analysis is implemented by varying loss given default, banks'
equity ratio and the ratio of interbank assets to total assets. The main result in this context is
that the sign of the correlation between entropy and the average percentage of assets affected
by bank failure depends on connectivity, loss given default and equity ratio. For high values of
LGD and low values of r (i.e. parameters that make a financial system vulnerable to interbank
contagion) the sign of the correlation between entropy and the average percentage of assets
affected tends to be positive, while for low values of LGD and high values of r (i.e. parameters
that make a financial system resilient to interbank contagion) the sign of the correlation tends
to be negative. For "intermediate" parameter values the sign of the correlation changes from
negative to positive with decreasing connectivity.
A second, probably more realistic, approach to modelling incomplete networks is to consider
money center systems. The main idea of money center models is to distinguish between large
core banks that are strongly connected to each other and small banks in the periphery that are
only linked to one core bank. Not surprisingly, the more concentrated assets are within a money
center system, the less stable it is. Additionally, using reasonable parameters for the number of
core banks and the concentration of assets among core banks, it turns out that, for all simulations
run, the money center system is less stable than a random graph with homogeneous bank size.
As a conclusion, this paper extends the existing literature on interbank contagion within a
33
financial network by explicitly considering the distribution of claims within the financial system,
and therefore gives a variety of insights into the determinants of financial stability. This approach
can be widened to aspects of interbank contagion extending domino effects (e.g. contagion due to
liquidity problems or refinancing problems). Therefore, this approach leaves a lot of new topics
for future research.

The new matrix should deviate from the maximum entropy solution as little as possible. Thus,
out of all possible normalized matrices Xp, a matrix X has to be created that minimizes the

This minimization problem can be either solved using the RAS algorithm (see Blien and Graef
(1991)) or using the "fmincon-command" of MATLAB's optimization toolbox. Both approaches

7.2 Appendix 2: Specification of the linear relationship between en-
tropy and relative entropy to the maximum entropy solution
Consider a network of N nodes (N - 1 banks and one external sector) and, in particular, the
(N - 1) × (N - 1) interbank liability matrix that is normalized by the total amount of interbank
assets / liabilities. Normalization implies that the sum of row as well as the sum of column
sums has to be equal to 1. The characteristic of the maximum entropy solution of the interbank
matrix is that claims are distributed as equally as possible for given row and column sums. Thus,
under the assumption that all banks are of equal size, the general result of the maximum entropy
solution is a matrix with row and column sums of 1
N-1
and off-diagonal elements of 1
(N-1)(N-2)

with 0 · ln(0) := 0.
Inserting the equation for entropy yields the following result:
RE = -ENT - ln 1
(N-1)(N-2)
or
RE = ln ((N - 1)(N - 2)) - ENT
As an example, consider 11 nodes in the system (10 banks and one external sector). The rela-
tionship between entropy and relative entropy to the maximum entropy solution is thus given
by:
RE = 4.4998 - ENT
This equation can be confirmed by simulation (see Figure 23).
