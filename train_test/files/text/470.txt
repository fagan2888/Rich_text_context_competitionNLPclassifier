Introduction
The oldest-old, including nonagenarians and cente-
narians, are the fastest growing segment of the popula-
tion in western developed countries. On average, the
number of people reaching the age of 100 doubles every
10 years in low-mortality countries [1]. This has led to an
ongoing debate about whether increases in exceptional
longevity mean healthier oldest-old populations or not
[2, 3]. Becoming a centenarian is not desirable if good
cognitive and physical abilities are not retained. Cente-
narian studies are not only relevant to future generations
of oldest-old but also important as a guide in the provi-
sion of care for an aging population.
Only few countries can fuel the debates on how the
very long life ends with empirical data, and even fewer are
able to compare birth cohorts of centenarians. In Den-
mark, one of the first centenarian surveys was conducted
in 1995 and repeated again in a 10-year-younger birth
cohort in 2005 [4]. This unique data material offers the
possibility of examining cohort differences in health and
function among centenarians. The present study focuses
on the cognitive aspect.
Age-related loss of cognitive abilities has been estab-
lished in several mainly cross-sectional trials [5­8]. The
only study at present examining trends in cognitive func-
tion among centenarians showed a decline in cognitive

Abstract
Background/Aim: The objective was to examine cohort
changes in cognitive function in 2 cohorts of centenarians
born 10 years apart. Methods: The Longitudinal Study of
Danish Centenarians comprises all Danes reaching the age
of 100 in the period April 1, 1995 through May 31, 1996. A to-
tal of 207 out of 276 persons participated (75%). The Danish
1905 Cohort Survey includes all individuals born in 1905. In
total, 225 out of 364 persons who reached the age of 100 in
the cohort participated in the most recent 2005 follow-up
(62%). In both cohorts, cognitive function was assessed us-
ing the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: There were
no significant differences in cognitive score between the
two centenarian birth cohorts. However, modest tendencies
were seen towards better cognitive functioning for the cen-
tenarians in the 1905 cohort living at home compared to the
home-dwelling ones in the 1895 cohort and worse cognitive
performance for the centenarians in the 1905 group living in
nursing homes compared to the nursing home dwellers in
the 1895 cohort. Conclusion: The increasing number of cen-
tenarians may not entail larger proportions of cognitively
impaired individuals in this extreme age group.

abilities among cohorts of Okinawan centenarians from
the 1970s to the 1990s. Cognitive performance declined
more among community-dwelling centenarians than
among those living in institutions [9].
In the present investigation, we compared cognitive
function as assessed using the Mini-Mental State Exami-
nation (MMSE) in 2 birth cohorts of centenarians born
10 years apart in Denmark. The MMSE has been em-
ployed in several other centenarian studies, despite the
problems of vision and hearing impairment in this ex-
treme age group [10­14], and represents a commonly ac-
cepted psychometric test in the research of cognition and
dementia [5].
With about 42% more of the 1905 cohort making it to
100 years compared to the 1895 group, we tested whether
the younger cohort would display worse cognitive perfor-
mance than the older one. The study also focused on dif-
ferential trends according to sex and housing.
Methods
Study Population
The study was based on a comparison of 2 Danish centenarian
cohorts born in 1895/1896 and 1905.
The Longitudinal Study of Danish Centenarians (LSDC) com-
prises all individuals celebrating their 100th birthday in the pe-
riod April 1, 1995 through May 31, 1996. The names and address-
es of all eligible individuals were identified through the Danish
Civil Registration System. A total of 207 out of 276 eligible 100-
year-olds participated in the survey (75%). A non-response analy-
sis showed no significant differences between responders and
non-responders regarding gender, housing and mean number of
hospitalizations in the previous 18 years [15]. The personal inter-
view consisted of sociodemographic variables and health, and
cognitive testing using the MMSE as well as a clinical examina-
tion [16, 17]. The scientific ethics committee of the counties of
Funen and Vejle, Odense, Denmark, approved the study (trial
numbers: 95/93 and 95/93MC). The LSDC is described in detail
in Andersen-Ranberg et al. [15].
The Danish 1905 cohort survey comprises all individuals born
in 1905 and living in Denmark on April 1, 1968, identified through
the Danish Civil Registration System. At baseline in 1998, a total of
3,600 persons were still alive in the cohort, and of these 2,262 (63%)
participated in the baseline survey. The baseline survey and subse-
quent follow-ups consisted of a personal interview in the respon-
dents' home covering sociodemographic factors, medical status,
health and cognitive functioning. Cognitive performance was as-
sessed using the MMSE [16]. Trained interviewers from the Danish
National Institute of Social Research carried out the survey. Since
baseline, in-person follow-up surveys have been conducted every
2­3 years. The most recent one took place in 2005, when the survi-
vors could celebrate their 100th birthday, and a total of 166 respon-
dents participated. To increase the number of participants in the
2005 follow-up, all earlier non-responders from previous waves
were re-contacted. This yielded another 90 persons, increasing the
total number of respondents in the last wave to 256. Not all of the
respondents had reached the age of 100 at the time of the last inter-
view. In this cohort comparison we included only those in the 1905
cohort who lived to celebrate their 100th birthday before death, in
total 225 out of 364 eligible respondents (62%). A non-response
analysis showed no difference between participants and non-par-
ticipants with regard to gender (females, 84 vs. 89%, p = 0.213),
median number of hospitalizations (p = 0.56) or bed days in hospi-
tal (p = 0.71) during the years 2003 and 2004 (online suppl. table 1,
www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000149819). The 1905 cohort is de-
scribed in detail elsewhere [18, 19]. The ethics committee system
in Denmark approved the study (trial number VF20040240).
Measures
Housing was divided into a binary variable reflecting whether
the respondent was living at home or in a nursing home. The nurs-
ing home group also included those living in sheltered housing.
Educational level was dichotomized into 2 categories reflect-
ing whether the respondent had 7 or less or more than 7 years of
schooling.
Marital status was a binary variable reflecting whether the
participant was married or not. Divorced or separated respon-
dents were assigned to the non-married group.
Cognitive function was assessed using the MMSE developed by
Folstein et al. [16]. The MMSE is subdivided into 6 areas of cogni-
tive functioning: orientation, registration, calculation or atten-
tion, recall, language and praxis. The correct scores of each area
are summed to a maximum score of 30 points. In the present
study, the total scores were divided into 3 categories using the
conventions established in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area
studies in the USA [20]: cognitive impairment was graded as se-
vere for those having scores between 0 and 17, mild for scores be-
tween 18 and 23 and not present for scores between 24 and 30.
Because the MMSE relies heavily on visual and auditory abil-
ities, the failure of reaching scores at or above the normality
threshold of 24 may be due to visual or hearing impairment, es-
pecially at advanced ages [11, 21]. To address this, we calculated
the MMSE Index, which is a numerical value between 0 and 1 re-
flecting the ratio between the actual score and the maximum ob-
tainable score in the MMSE, taking into account the existence of
visual impairment. This can be done by reducing the maximum
obtainablescorebyscoresaccordingtothequestionsintheMMSE
that require vision. Five items in the MMSE concern vision: item
6 (name 2 things in front of you ­ 2 points), item 8 (a 3-stage com-
mand ­ 3 points), item 9 (read and obey a sentence ­ 1 point), item
10 (write a sentence making sense to the interviewer ­ 1 point)
and item 11 (copying 2 overlapping pentagrams ­ 1 point). The
total score of these items is 8 points. Thus, the standard maximum
score of 30 can be reduced down to 22 points. However, it is pos-
sible to reduce the maximum score by less than 8 points if the re-
spondent is able to perform and complete some of the above-men-
tioned items despite his or her visual impairment. The maximum
obtainable score for the visually impaired respondents can there-
fore vary between 22 and 29 points.
We dealt with missing information due to visual impairment
by calculating the MMSE Index for each respondent as described
above. The MMSE Index was then divided into 4 groups accord-
ing to Motta et al. [22], with 1.00­0.81 reflecting no cognitive
impairment, 0.80­0.63 indicating slight signs of cognitive injury,
0.62­0.40 reflecting moderate cognitive decline and 0.39­0.00

equal to severe cognitive impairment. The `no cognitive impair-
ment' and the `slight signs of cognitive impairment' groups are
considered in the normal range established for the elderly [22]. In
addition to the categorization of the MMSE scores and the calcu-
lation of the MMSE Index, the median MMSE score in both co-
horts was compared. Missing information due to non-response or
refusal was scored as error, i.e. the respondent was assigned 0
points for the particular item, following the recommendations by
Fillenbaum et al. [23].
Data Analysis
Differences in categorical variables between the cohorts were
analyzed using the Fisher Exact test. Comparison of group medi-
ans on the MMSE was performed with the Wilcoxon rank sum
test. A p value of !0.05 was considered to indicate statistical sig-
nificance. The data were analyzed using STATA Statistical Soft-
ware Package version 8.2, Stata Corporation [24].
Results
There was a clear-cut predominance of women com-
pared to men in both cohorts, and over time an increas-
ing trend was evident. In favour of women, the sex ratios
equalled 3.6 in the LSDC and 5.3 in the 1905 Cohort Sur-
vey. With regard to housing, a slightly higher proportion
of the centenarians in the 1905 cohort compared to the
1895 group was still living in their own home. The pro-
portion of women in the 1905 cohort living in nursing
homes was significantly lower than in the 1895 group
(p = 0.04). Overall, the cohorts did not differ significant-
ly with respect to educational level or marital status.
Stratified by gender, a significantly higher proportion of
males in the 1905 cohort compared to the 1895 one had
more than 7 years of schooling (p = 0.04), but the num-
bers were small (table 1).
Approximately 75% of the centenarians in the LSDC
and 78% of those in the 1905 Cohort Survey were tested
using the MMSE (table 2). The observed differences in
the MMSE scores were not statistically significant. How-
ever, the prevalence of no cognitive impairment was
slightly higher in the 1905 cohort than in the 1895 group
due to a higher proportion of men in the 1905 cohort hav-
ing scores reflecting no cognitive impairment (54 vs.
33%). No cohort differences were seen with respect to the
MMSE Index. However, the proportion of men without
cognitive impairment was higher in the 1905 than in the
1895 cohort (43 vs. 28%), although non-significant due to
the small number of males.
Table 3 depicts the distribution of MMSE scores strat-
ified by housing and sex. The majority of the observed
differences were small and not statistically significant.
The home-dwelling centenarians in the 1905 cohort had
better cognitive function than those living at home in the
1895 cohort. Stratified by gender, this was due to a higher
proportion of men in the 1905 cohort having scores re-
flecting no cognitive impairment (77 vs. 21%), but the

numbers were small. Among the centenarians living in
nursing homes the opposite tendency was evident in both
sexes. The participants living in nursing homes in the
1905 cohort were more cognitively impaired than the
nursing home dwellers in the 1895 group (50 vs. 41%), es-
pecially among women.
In a previous paper we had found an increased use of
common assistive devices such as a walker, an elevated
toilet seat, a bathing chair and handles or a handgrip in
the 1905 compared to the 1895 cohort [4]. This increased
use of assistive devices was observed both among home-
dwelling centenarians and individuals living in nursing
homes. In the present study we found that among the
home-dwelling centenarians there was a tendency to-
wards worse cognitive function for the participants using
assistive devices but better cognitive performance for the

among Danish Centenarians

centenarians not employing such tools in the 1905 cohort
compared to the 1895 group. For the centenarians living
in nursing homes a tendency towards worse cognitive
function was present in the 1905 cohort independently of
the use of assistive devices (data not shown).
The proportion of centenarians who could perform a
complete or an incomplete MMSE was approximately
the same in both cohorts (table 4). Comparing the sam-
ples within the groups of complete or incomplete MMSE
did not reveal any systematic differences in MMSE
scores. However, the proportion of subjects in the 1905
cohort with a complete MMSE and a high MMSE score
was a little higher than in the 1895 one. Among the cen-
tenarians who could not perform a complete MMSE, vi-
sual impairment was the most frequent reason in both
cohorts.
Discussion
Overall there were no systematic differences between
the cohorts with respect to cognitive function as mea-
sured using the MMSE. Among the centenarians living
at home and those living in nursing homes, modest ten-
dencies were seen towards both better and worse cogni-
tive performance in the 1905 compared to the 1895 co-
hort: in the 1905 sample the men living at home had bet-
ter cognitive performance than those in the 1895 group,
but the numbers were small. Comparing the nursing
home dwellers of the 1905 cohort with those of the 1895
sample, there was a tendency towards more cognitive im-
pairment, especially among women.
A slightly higher proportion of centenarians was liv-
ing in their own home in the 1905 cohort compared to
the 1895 one. This could be a reflection of increased al-
location of resources to home health care services. In a
previous paper we had found an increased use of com-
mon assistive devices in the 1905 cohort compared to the
1895 cohort [4], both among centenarians living at home
and among nursing home dwellers. The additional analy-
sis in the present study may indicate that this increased
use of assistive devices allows a higher proportion of cen-
tenarians with cognitive impairment to stay at home.
Then it would follow that the lower proportion of indi-
viduals living in nursing homes would have more signif-
icant cognitive decline.
In terms of absolute figures, 256 persons in Denmark
reached the age of 100 during 1995, of those 209 women
and 47 men. In 2005, a total of 364 persons reached 100
years of age, 313 women and 51 men [25]. The proportion
of people reaching their 100th birthday in Denmark thus
increased by 42% over the course of 10 years with a dis-
tinct gender difference in favour of women compared to
men. One pessimistic expectation could be that the rising
number of 100-year-olds would entail a large proportion
of cognitively impaired individuals in this extreme age
group. On the other hand, the results of the present study
do not support this expectation. Although the number of
centenarians increased substantially between 1995 and
2005, the proportion with low cognitive performance
stayed approximately the same. This is a positive finding
compared to the study by Suzuki et al. [9] describing de-
teriorating trends in cognitive functioning among Oki-
nawan centenarians. In the Okinawan study the cogni-

tive abilities declined more among centenarians living at
home than among those living in institutions. In con-
trast, our study showed a tendency towards better cogni-
tive performance among home-dwelling centenarians
and worse cognitive function among participants living
in nursing homes.
The lack of agreement between the findings of the
Okinawan study and our research may partly be due to
the different mortality selection present in Denmark and
Japan. It is well known that for decades, the life expec-
tancy for both men and women has been less favourable
in Denmark than in other low-mortality countries such
as Japan, Spain, Italy and France. Based on the life tables
for 2006/2007 the life expectancy at birth in Denmark
was 75.9 years for men and 80.5 years for women, i.e. 2­4
years lower than in France (77.5 for men and 84.4 for
women) [25]. Denmark experienced a stagnation in life
expectancy at birth and at the age of 65 in the decades
before 1995, primarily due to stagnating death rates
among middle-aged individuals [26, 27]. It was not until
after 1995 that the life expectancy in Denmark substan-
tially increased again [28]. The slower growth in the
number of centenarians in Denmark compared to other
low-mortality countries may explain the lack of deterio-
ration of cognitive function. However, it should be
stressed that the oldest-old mortality continued to de-
cline, also during the stagnation period [27], and that the
number of Danish centenarians still increased substan-
tially between 1995 and 2005 (42%).
Our study has important strengths. Both surveys were
population based and included community dwellers as
well as institutionalized residents. Second, both surveys
displayed a relatively high response rate for centenarians.
Third, both cohorts were shown to be unselected with
regard to gender, and mean or median number of hospi-
talizations (data not shown). Additionally, the sex ratios
in the LSDC (3.6) and the Danish 1905 cohort survey (5.3)
largely correspond to those of the overall population of
individuals reaching the age of 100 in Denmark in 1995
(4.4) and 2005 (6.1) [25].
The cohort comparison had some limitations. We
used data from 2 surveys with some discrepancies in de-
sign and method of data collection. The LSDC enrolled
and examined eligible respondents consecutively over a
period of time as they reached 100 years of age. In the
1905 cohort survey the respondents were first contacted
when they were 92­93 years of age and then followed up
every second to third year until they reached 100 years of
age. Additionally, earlier non-responders of previous
waves were re-contacted in the 2005 wave.
Both surveys were conducted as in-person interviews
in the respondent's own home. However, trained inter-
viewers from the Danish Institute of Social Research car-
ried out the 1905 cohort survey, whereas the same geria-
trician and geriatric nurse made all the preparatory con-
tacts and conducted all the interviews in the LSDC. The
latter may have influenced the response rate in a positive
direction. To minimize the bias, the interviewers from
the Danish National Institute of Social Research con-
ducting the most recent follow-up in the 1905 cohort
were trained by the same geriatrician who carried out the
LSDC.
A span of 10 years may not be enough to detect cohort
differences among centenarians. However, in a previous
study comparing activities of daily living between the
two birth cohorts we found a significant improvement in
activities of daily living among women in the 1905 cohort
compared to women in the 1895 sample [4]. Thus, for ac-
tivities of daily living the time frame of 10 years seems to
be sufficient. In support of this, previous research con-
ducted among younger age groups used similar or even
narrower time frames [29­32], and most of these studies
were able to detect significant cohort differences in fa-
vour of more recent cohorts.
Approximately 25% of the respondents in both groups
were not tested with the MMSE. In the 1895 cohort this
was primarily due to cognitive impairment or severe de-
mentia [17]. Comparison of the groups not tested and
those tested showed that the individuals not tested were
more often living in nursing homes in both cohorts. Since
the proportion of non-tested centenarians was nearly
identical in both samples, this is unlikely to impact the
results of the study.
We dealt with missing information on the MMSE due
to visual impairment by calculating the MMSE Index. An
alternative method is to make use of imputed item scores.
However, this may lead to a biased result because the pos-
sibility of assigning too high scores to respondents with
missing scores cannot be ruled out [23].
When using the MMSE as a brief screening test for
cognitive impairment in population-based studies, age
and educational level have to be taken into account [5].

for otherwise healthy individuals and also that individu-
als with higher levels of education perform better on the
MMSE compared to a person of the same age with a low-
er educational level [33­35]. A significantly higher pro-
portion of the men in the 1905 cohort compared to those
in the 1895 cohort had more than 7 years of schooling.
This may impact the results of the study, although un-

likely due to the small number of males. The two cohorts
were of the same age. It is therefore unlikely that age and
educational level influenced the results of the study.
A potential problem of using the MMSE in repeated
surveys is the introduction of a possible learning effect,
i.e. longitudinal respondents may display a higher MMSE
score than those who encounter the MMSE for the first
time. However, in view of the time interval of 2­3 years
between the interview surveys of the 1905 cohort we con-
sider this possibility to be very limited. Additional analy-
ses showed no significant difference in MMSE scores for
the participants encountering the MMSE for the first
time in the last wave of the 1905 Cohort Survey and the
subjects who had gone through repeated MMSE tests
during the previous waves of the 1905 Cohort Survey
(data not shown).
A pertinent issue in our study is the use of the MMSE
as the only measure of cognitive function. Different find-
ings may have been evident had there been a more exten-
sive battery of tests with a more sophisticated instrument.
However, a previous study based on the 1905 cohort using
both the MMSE and a more sensitive instrument consist-
ing of the combined score of 5 different cognitive tests, a
so-called cognitive composite score (which was not used
in the 1895 cohort), found that both the MMSE and the
cognitive composite score were predictive of survival
during the 2-year follow-up and both in the same dose-
response fashion [19]. The MMSE may be a crude instru-
ment but also appropriate in the sense that at this ad-
vanced age approximately half of the population may be
more or less cognitively impaired [17].
In conclusion, this study found no significant differ-
ences in cognitive score between the two centenarian
birth cohorts using the MMSE. On the other hand, in the
1905 compared to the 1895 cohort, modest tendencies
were seen towards better cognitive function for the cente-
narians living at home and worse cognitive performance
for those living in nursing homes. These tendencies may
be important because in the 1905 cohort compared to the
1895 sample a slightly higher proportion of centenarians
was living at home and fewer centenarians were living in
nursing homes, probably a reflection of increased alloca-
tion of resources to home health care services.
Our findings suggest that the growing number of cen-
tenarians may not entail increasing proportions of cogni-
tively impaired individuals in this extreme age group.
However, had Denmark experienced a similar decline in
oldest-old mortality in recent decades as that seen in
Southern European countries and Japan, the findings of
the study might have proved different.
