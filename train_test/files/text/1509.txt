Abstract
In 2008 the National Center for Health Statistics released a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) whole body dataset from
the NHANES population-based sample acquired with modern fan beam scanners in 15 counties across the United States
from 1999 through 2004. The NHANES dataset was partitioned by gender and ethnicity and DXA whole body measures of
%fat, fat mass/height2, lean mass/height2, appendicular lean mass/height2, %fat trunk/%fat legs ratio, trunk/limb fat mass
ratio of fat, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) were analyzed to provide reference values for
subjects 8 to 85 years old. DXA reference values for adults were normalized to age; reference values for children included
total and sub-total whole body results and were normalized to age, height, or lean mass. We developed an obesity
classification scheme by using estabbody mass index (BMI) classification thresholds and prevalences in young adults to
generate matching classification thresholds for Fat Mass Index (FMI; fat mass/height2). These reference values should be
helpful in the evaluation of a variety of adult and childhood abnormalities involving fat, lean, and bone, for establishing
entry criteria into clinical trials, and for other medical, research, and epidemiological uses.

Introduction
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a program designed to assess the health and
nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.
NHANES performs a continuous, nationally representative health
survey of the civilian, non-institutionalized United States popula-
tion, collecting data on about 5000 persons each year from
interviews, physical examinations, and medical tests including
bone densitometry. Previous NHANES surveys provided a widely
accepted DXA proximal femur BMD database [1]. In 1999
NHANES began performing DXA whole body measurements on
survey subjects 8 years old and older in three mobile examination
centers. DXA whole body data from the mobile exam centers was
compiled by the NHANES study group and released on the
Center for Disease Control (CDC) website. Previous studies used
the data to investigate age, gender, and ethnic differences in whole
body and regional BMD [2] or compared percent body fat to
BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-stature ratio in adults [3].
We report here on an age, gender, and ethnicity-specific DXA
body composition and bone mineral reference database developed
from the NHANES survey data collected from 1999 to 2004.
Additionally, we developed an obesity classification scheme by
calculating the prevalences of well established BMI classification
thresholds and generating similar thresholds for Fat Mass Index
(FMI; fat mass/height2) [4]. These prevalence-matched FMI
classifications should offer superior specificity because the index is
based on fat mass, not body weight, which is composed of both fat
and lean constituents. The reference data reported here should be
helpful in detecting abnormalities in whole body bone and body
composition, for establishing reference ranges, for epidemiological
considerations (e.g., to establish the prevalence of obesity or
sarcopenia), and for entry criteria into clinical trials.
Methods
Subjects
Reference curves were developed for the following three major
U.S. ethnic groups: Non-Hispanic Whites (hereafter referred to as
White), Non-Hispanic Blacks (hereafter referred to as Black), and
Mexican Americans. There were not enough observations to
develop reference data for other ethnic minorities. Blacks, Mexican
Americans, low-income Whites, adolescents between 12 and 19
years old, and subjects 60 years old and older were oversampled to
provide more reliable estimates for these groups [3]. Females were
excluded from the DXA examination if a pregnancy test was
positive at exam time or if they said they were pregnant. Subjects
were also excluded if their reported weight exceeded the DXA scan
table weight limit of 136 kg or if their reported height was greater
than the DXA scan table length of 196 cm''.
DXA Measurements
The whole body DXA exams in NHANES were acquired
according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 9 | e7038
on a QDR 4500A fan beam densitometer (Hologic, Inc., Bedford,
MA). All subjects changed into paper gowns and were asked to
remove all jewelry and other personal effects that could interfere
with the DXA exam. The DXA exams were reviewed and
analyzed by the University of California, San Francisco Depart-
ment of Radiology Bone Density Group using industry standard
techniques. Analysis of all exams was performed using Hologic
Discovery software version 12.1 in its default configuration. Exams
that contained artifacts which could affect the accuracy of the
DXA results, such as prosthetic devices, implants or other
extraneous objects had the regional and global DXA results for
these exams set to missing in the dataset. The precision of the
DXA instrument used in the NHANES study has been reported
on elsewhere [5,6,7].
Body composition measurements are technology and calibration
dependent and hence results provided by different instruments
vary widely. The DXA instruments used in the NHANES survey
employed the calibration proposed by Schoeller et al. [8], whereby
DXA lean mass results were calibrated to lean mass measured in 7
independent studies utilizing total body water (4 studies),
hydrodensitometry (1 study), and four compartment measures (2
studies). The seven independent studies involved a total of 1195
subjects (602 male, 593 female). The BMD and BMC results were
calibrated by the DXA manufacturer and maintained by an
internal reference system that periodically measures bone and soft
tissue equivalent reference standards during the patient measure-
ment.
The NHANES data sets contained whole body DXA
measurements of bone mineral content (BMC, g), areal bone
mineral density (BMD, g/cm2), fat mass (g) and lean mass
including BMC (g) and percent fat, calculated as (fat mass divided
by total mass) 6100 along with demographic information for each
subject. The above measurements were also available for a
number of pre-defined anatomical regions, including the head,
arms, legs, trunk, pelvic regions, sub-total whole body (excluding
only the head) and whole body. From these whole body measures
the following derivative values were calculated: FMI (fat mass/
height2), lean mass/height2, appendicular lean mass/height2. For
adults, only total body reference values and the above derivative
reference values were generated. For children, (subjects less than
20 years of age), total body and sub-total body reference values
and selected derivative reference values were generated.
There is increasing realization that fat distribution may be as
important as total fat mass, so two indices of fat mass distribution,
%fat of the trunk divided by %fat of the legs and fat mass of the
trunk divided by fat mass of the limbs (fat mass of arms plus legs)
were included in this analysis for adults. These indices may have a
role in defining metabolic syndrome or lipodystorphy [9,10].
Statistical Methods
Our analysis used the DXA data sets released by NHANES on
the Center for Disease Control website http://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/about/major/nhanes/dxx/dxa.htm). To prevent bias in the
survey due to the fact that the missing data was not completely
random, missing data was multiply imputed at the National
Center for Health Statistics as described in the technical
documentation available on the above referenced website.
The data was partitioned into subgroups according to gender
and ethnicity. Ethnicity was self-reported and adjudicated by
NHANES into the three major ethnicity groups reported on here
(White, Black, and Mexican American). To reduce the complexity
of the reference curve fitting procedure, we further divided the
data into adult (ages 20­85) and pediatric (ages 8­19+) groups.
The number of observations in each subgroup is provided in
Table 1.
For adult subjects, DXA measures were modeled by gender and
ethnicity using age as the independent variable. Whole body fat
and lean mass measurements and appendicular lean mass were
normalized to height2 as suggested by Heymsfield et al. [11].

For pediatric subjects the DXA measures were modeled against
age, height, or lean mass as the independent variable. The
development of skeletal reference values were based on the
recommendations of the ICSD task force for Pediatric Official
Positions paper [12]. Additional soft tissue reference values
generated in pediatric subjects included total body %fat and lean
mass/height2 (kg/m2).
A curve fitting procedure called LMS (lmsChartMaker Pro
Version 2.3) [13] was used to generate the reference curves
because it is capable of handling the relatively common situation
where the underlying reference data are skew, i.e. the data are not
normally distributed. It does so by normalizing the underlying
reference data by dividing the independent measure (e.g. age) into
groups and then applying a power transformation which extends
one tail of the distribution and contracts the other, eliminating
skewness in the variable under analysis. A smooth curve is fitted to
the normalizing power transformation for each age group,
generating an optimum ``L'' (power) curve that normalizes the
dependent measure, e.g. %fat, over the entire age range. The
procedure also fits Median (M) and coefficient of variation (S)
curves, and these three curves (L, M, and S) fully describe the
reference data. We report the more commonly used population
standard deviation, s, which is S times M. The z-scores can be
calculated by the following equation:
Z~
M X=M
ð ÞL{1
 
Ls
or
Z~M ln X=M
ð Þ=s,L~0
where X is the physical measurement (e.g. DXA Total Body
BMD, DXA %fat, etc.), L is the power transformation, M is the
median value, and s is the population standard deviation [13].
Percentiles can be obtained from z-scores, e.g. z-scores of 21.881,
21.645, 20.674, 0, 0.674, 1.645, and 1.881 correspond to the
3rd, 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th, and 97th percentiles, respectively.
As previously stated, the data were separated into pediatric and
adult groups to simplify the curve fitting process and to lower the
equivalent degrees of freedom required to fit a suitable curve to the
reference data. For example, it was observed that very complex
curves were required to produce a satisfactory model of BMC
versus age in the entire population, due to the exponential BMC
accrual observed in younger subjects combined with a consolida-
tion phase of BMC in early adulthood and then a relatively modest
decline in BMC that occurs during aging. When these two very
different processes (growth and aging) were modeled indepen-
dently, much simpler models could be employed with improved
goodness of fit and decreased complexity.
During the curve fitting process, the weighted observations from
the NHANES data sets were fitted by selecting more parsimonious
models over more complex models so long as the goodness of fit
was similar, i.e. we tried to avoid over fitting the curves. Further,
we employed careful visual inspection of the Q statistic, a plot of
standardized residuals in which the data are split into groups and
the non-random between group variations in the estimated
moments of the z-scores are plotted against the equivalent degrees
of freedom used to fit the curve. The Q-statistic was considered
satisfactory at or below a value of 2 for the L, M, and S curves and
if the fitted curve was reasonably smooth and plausible for the data
being fitted, as recommended by the developers of LMS [13].
An obesity classification scheme based on FMI was developed
by first calculating the prevalences of established WHO BMI
classification thresholds (e.g. normal, overweight, obese) in the
present NHANES survey data using ``young normal adults'' at age
of 25. From these prevalence values for BMI, we then generated
classification thresholds for FMI that gave the same prevalences as
BMI in this population at age 25. In effect we have translated the
WHO BMI thresholds into FMI equivalent values by matching
the prevalences of the two indices at each classification cut-off
point. The FMI classifications should misclassify fewer individuals
because FMI is based on fat mass, not body weight, which contains
both fat and lean components and therefore misclassifies some
muscular subjects as overweight or obese.
Results
The number of observations in the reference database by age
group, gender, and ethnicity is provided in Table 1. The reference
curves developed from the whole body DXA measures and
derivative values from the 2008 NHANES data set are provided in
Table 2. Reference values for each of the DXA measures in
Table 2 are provided in supplementary Table S1 through Table
S20 by sex and ethnicity. Scatter plots with the fits including the
mean, the 3rd and 97th percentiles superimposed upon the raw
data values are provided in the supplementary Figure S1 through
Figure S20 for adults and children.
As expected, significant differences were observed between
genders for the various measures and these differences varied with
age. The median %fat increased monotonically with age from 17
to 85 in males, while in women it peaked at approximately age 65.
Differences between ethnicities were more modest, and varied
with gender. Black males had slightly less %fat than non-black
males at all ages. Differences in %fat between non-black males and
non-black females was about 11­12% and fairly constant with age;
larger differences of 12­16% were observed between black males
and black females and the differences were more variable with age.
As can be seen from the scatter plots in the Supplementary
Figures, some of the data were not only significantly skewed, but
the degree of skewness and the standard deviation varied with the
independent variable. The curve fitting method of LMS smoothly
models both varying non-normal distributions and varying
standard deviations to construct reference curves which accurately
model the true distribution and variance of the underlying data.
The LMS curve fitting procedure adjusts for skewness so that the
percentile values and z-scores generated by the LMS values are
robust when the data are not normally distributed. Statistical
theory states that a properly fitted reference curve will generate z-
scores very close to zero with a standard deviation very close to
unity. Using the SAS system, we calculated z-scores for all subjects
and all DXA measures in the NHANES dataset; average z-scores
were very close to zero with standard deviations very close to unity
for all fitted DXA measures, indicating that the LMS curve fitting
procedure produced robust, unbiased fits to the underlying
reference data.
We employed the BMI classifications from the WHO technical
report on the use and interpretation of anthropometry [14,15] to
establish similar classifications for FMI by calculating the
prevalences at age 25 for each of the WHO BMI classification
thresholds (e.g. mild thinness, normal, overweight, obese class 1,
etc.) and then assigning FMI values with matching prevalences to
each classification threshold. The FMI classification ranges were
similar for the three ethnic groups even though the BMI
classification prevalences varied widely (see Table 3). However,
large differences in FMI thresholds were observed between

genders, with women having higher FMI for all classification
categories, requiring the use of gender-specific FMI thresholds.
The final FMI classification thresholds in Table 4 were based on
the values for White subjects in Table 3. Although the values for
the three ethnic groups were similar, there were many more
observations for White subjects and hence the use of these values
should provide more robust classification estimates.
Discussion
The lack of representative body composition reference values
has limited their potential application in clinical and research
settings. The current report provides the first reference values on a
nationally representative NHANES data set acquired using well
established DXA technology. These reference values should prove
useful for many applications previously limited by inadequate or
unavailable reference data. The NHANES reference values
reported here are only directly compatible with Hologic fan beam
DXA scanners operating software version 12.5 or higher utilizing
the NHANES calibration. The NHANES reference data used in
this study included multiply imputed data and this may be a
limitation of the study. As with any reference database, the
application of these data to generate diagnostic scores for a given
patient or patient population should be performed with appropri-
ate measure of forethought and caution.
The reference data presented here may be useful in detecting
skeletal and body composition abnormalities in children arising
from a wide variety of conditions and chronic diseases including
anorexia nervosa, growth hormone deficiency, glucocorticoid use,
immobilization, cystic fibrosis, hypogonadism, thalassemia, mal-
nutrition, weight management, chronic inflammatory diseases,
endocrine disturbances, childhood cancer, transplantation, and
other disorders [16]. Increasing numbers of children are being
referred for DXA whole body measurements because of its ability
to evaluate global and regional bone mineral and body
composition. Total body less head (sub-total) whole body results

are currently recommended by the ISCD for the evaluation of
some childhood disorders [12]. Normalizing to height is
appropriate in children with delayed growth and maturation.
Furthermore, sub-total (whole body less head) BMD and BMC
reference data are necessary because the head is disproportion-
ately large in young children and may mask deficits at other
skeletal sites. As a result, we developed whole body and sub-total
BMD and BMC reference curves for subjects 8 to 20 years old
normalized to both age and height. Height is an important body
size adjustment in children because children mature at different
rates and because many chronically ill children are small for their
age. As a result, chronological age may not be the best indicator of
a child's growth and development and therefore age-matched
comparisons may not be appropriate. The International Society
for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) also recommends the use of a
sufficiently large sample of the general population that takes into
consideration gender, age, and ethnicity [17]. The present
database meets all of these conditions through the use of gender,
and ethnicity specific reference data from NHANES including
DXA sub-total body measures normalized to age and to body size
(height). We also developed total lean mass versus height and sub-
total BMC versus lean mass reference curves for children, as
suggested by the ISCD in its latest Official Positions Statement for
Pediatric DXA (see www.iscd.org). These two additional curves
should allow for the detection of abnormalities in lean mass
accrual, e.g. in growth hormone deficient children, and for the
detection of abnormalities in the bone-muscle unit, respectively, as
suggested by Schoenau et al. [18]. NHANES did not collect
information on pubertal development and therefore no adjustment
to the reference values to account for delayed maturation was
possible. As a result, clinicians should use caution when
interpreting DXA measures in subjects with delayed or advanced
maturation.
In adults, we normalized both fat and lean mass by height2, just
like BMI, which is simply weight divided by height2. Studies have
shown that lean mass and weight scale with height to
approximately the power of two, establishing an analytic
framework for height-scaled indices [11]. The same study also
found that fat mass scaled to height2, although the association was
weaker. The present study confirmed this observation. We
hypothesized that comparison of a subject's FMI value to healthy
young normal FMI values may be useful in the diagnosis and
management of clinical obesity, for identifying subjects with high
obesity-disease risks, and for enrolling high risk subjects in clinical
trials. However, while these cross sectional data enable this
definition, whether this definition is useful and appropriate will
have to be investigated in future studies which look at obesity
related morbidity and outcomes. Defining thresholds in compar-
ison to a young adult population has been adopted in the field of
osteoporosis research (e.g. the bone mineral density T-score) and
has proven itself a useful tool.
Reference curves for appendicular lean mass divided by height2
were developed because this DXA measure is a good surrogate for
skeletal muscle mass and a possible index of sarcopenia [19]. DXA
is the only widely available technology capable of providing
regional measures of fat and lean mass, and it has been shown that
fat and lean distribution may predict health outcomes. A study of
elderly subjects [13] demonstrated that sarcopenia, defined as
appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg/height2) less than two
standard deviations below the mean of a young reference group,
predicted self-reported physical disability in elderly men and
women independent of other covariates such as age, obesity,
ethnicity, and income level.
In the present NHANES database fat comprises approximately
24% of body weight in males and 38% in females at age 25.
Although these %fat values may seem quite high, they are
consistent with the %fat reference ranges reported by NHANES in
the 1988­1994 survey that utilized bioimpedence analysis. In the
1988­1994 survey, the average male and female %fat values at age
25 were 23% and 34%, respectively [20]. The slightly higher %fat
values reported here are consistent with the secular trend of
increasing weight and BMI in adult Americans. However, the two
studies used different technologies to measure %fat, so direct
comparisons between the two studies are difficult to interpret.
DXA is capable of separating body mass into fat and lean
components, thereby permitting the evaluation of fat mass without
the confounding influence of other tissue constituents. We propose
the use of FMI (fat mass/height2) as a measure of abnormally low
or excess fat mass because FMI evaluates only the fat mass
component of body weight. Using FMI, abnormalities in fat mass
can be assessed without interference from other unrelated
components such as excesses or deficits of muscle or water.
Our data reveal %fat and FMI increasing up until about age 80
in men and age 65 in women. Increasing adiposity is an unhealthy
trend and hence comparing DXA measurements of %fat and FMI
to age-matched peers may not be the most appropriate approach.
We postulate that it may be better to compare adults to young
normal gender and ethnicity-matched subjects at age 25. For
example, using the median value of %fat for non-Hispanic white
males at age 25 as an arbitrary ``healthy target'', only 25% of 45
year old non-Hispanic white males are at or below this target, and
by age 69, the number falls to less than 10%. Though alarming,
the low percentage of subjects at or below this healthy %fat target
probably provides a more realistic assessment of %fat and FMI
levels versus comparing subjects to age-matched controls, where
by definition 50% of subjects would appear ``normal''.
We selected from the present data a young adult group with a
BMI between 18.5 and 25 to establish reasonably robust reference
values for ``normal'' FMI. Following this same methodology, we
developed classifications for FMI by selecting values for FMI that
matched the population prevalence of the WHO BMI classifica-
tions [14] in young adults at age 25. For example, at age 25 a FMI
value of greater than 6 kg/m2 for men and 9 kg/m2 for women
matches the same prevalence value of ``overweight'' obtained with
a BMI of 25, the BMI cut-off point for ``overweight''. Similarly,
FMI values of greater than or equal to 9 kg/m2 for men and

Classification ranges for FMI that match the prevalences of the WHO BMI classifications (see Table 3). Unlike BMI, FMI is a gender specific measure of fat not confounded
by lean tissue.

13 kg/m2 for women defines the same obesity prevalence as a
BMI of 30 in this population. Kyle et al. [21] employed similar
methodology to generate FMI classifications corresponding to low,
normal, overweight, and obese BMI categories. Note that
although the same prevalences were used for each classification,
FMI and BMI actually classify different subjects into the various
categories. Were this not so, it would not be possible for one
method to have an advantage over the other. Gallagher et al. [22]
used the same approach to generate guidelines for healthy percent
fat ranges based on BMI.
A major shortcoming of BMI is that it provides a measure of
excess weight, not excess fat. Another obvious limitation of BMI is
that it does not account for gender or ethnicity. Table 3 clearly
demonstrates that BMI prevalences are heavily influenced by both
gender and ethnicity. At age 25, the FMI data in Table 3 indicates
that there are substantial differences in adiposity between genders,
with mean values for women ranging from 8.9 to 10.9 kg/m2 and
mean values for males between 5.6 to 6.8 kg/m2 for the three
ethnic groups. From these data it appears likely that lacking
gender or ethnicity adjustments, BMI may be overestimating
obesity in some groups and underestimating it in others.
Furthermore, subjects with a high degree of muscularity, e.g.
body builders, are often misclassified as ``overweight'' or ``obese''
by BMI; these same subjects would probably not fall into an
abnormal classification range with FMI because their excess
weight is mostly lean mass. Percent body fat (%fat) measurements
are also complicated by increased muscularity, but here the bias is
in the opposite direction, as increases in muscle mass offset
increases in fat mass, making a %fat measurement appear more or
less normal.
We suggest that using these proposed FMI values for overweight
and obese classifications will result in fewer misclassifications than
either BMI or %fat. The FMI classifications in Table 4 should be
considered guidelines that may misclassify fewer individuals than
BMI because they are based on fat mass instead of weight. It is also
worth noting that other technologies which measure fat mass will
have to be calibrated to the DXA systems used in this study in
order to make uses of these FMI classifications.
Whether or not the use of the proposed FMI classification
scheme will confer benefits over BMI in terms of predicting
obesity-related morbidity or mortality will have to be investigated
in future studies. The FMI classifications presented here are based
on prevalence data, not disease risk, and therefore the clinical
utility of the FMI classification scheme will not be known until
data relating disease risk to FMI becomes available.
