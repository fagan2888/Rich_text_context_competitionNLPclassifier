Diets rich in naturally occurring plant estrogens (phytoestrogens) are strongly associated with a decreased risk for cancer and heart disease in humans.
Phytoestrogens have estrogenic and, in some cases, antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic properties, and may contribute to the protective effect of some diets.
However, little information is available about the levels of these phytoestrogens in the general US population. Therefore, levels of phytoestrogens were
determined in urine (N ¼ 199) and serum (N ¼ 208) samples taken from a nonrepresentative subset of adults who participated in NHANES III, 1988­
1994. The phytoestrogens quantified were the lignans (enterolactone, enterodiol, matairesinol); the isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, equol, O-
desmethylangolensin); and coumestrol (urine only). Phytoestrogens with the highest mean urinary levels were enterolactone (512 ng/ml), daidzein (317 ng/
ml), and genistein (129 ng/ml). In serum, the concentrations were much less and the relative order was reversed, with genistein having the highest mean
level (4.7 ng/ml), followed by daidzein (3.9 ng/ml) and enterolactone (3.6 ng/ml). Highly significant correlations of phytoestrogen levels in urine and
serum samples from the same persons were observed for enterolactone, enterodiol, genistein, and daidzein. Determination of phytoestrogen
concentrations in large study populations will give a better insight into the actual dietary exposure to these biologically active compounds in the US
population.

1. Introduction
Decreased risks for heart disease and cancer are associated
with certain diets. This protective effect may result from
dietary micronutrients, macronutrients, biologically active
non-nutrients, or a combination of these and other factors.
The human diet contains a complex array of naturally
occurring bioactive compounds called phytochemicals.
Among these phytochemicals are phytoestrogens, a broad
group of plant-derived compounds of nonsteroidal structure
that can mimic estrogen. The largest dietary dosage of
phytoestrogenic activity results from two classes of com-
pounds: lignans and isoflavones. These groups modulate
many biologically relevant processes, including sex hormone
production and metabolism (Adlercreutz et al., 1987, 1988),
intracellular enzyme levels (Adlercreutz et al., 1993), protein
synthesis, malignant cell proliferation, cellular differentiation
(Adlercreutz and Mazur, 1997; Kurzer and Xu, 1997), and
oxidative balance (Phipps et al., 1993; Wei et al., 1995).
Although the physiologic relevance of some of these proper-
ties is questionable, consumption of foods rich in phytoestro-
gens is associated with significantly reduced risk for cancer,
osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and severity of meno-
pause (Adlercreutz and Mazur, 1997; Kurzer and Xu, 1997).
Additionally, certain lignans (Saarinen et al., 2001) and
isoflavones reduce carcinogen-induced cancer in laboratory
animals (Lamartiniere et al., 1995a, b).
Although considerable health benefits are associated with
diets rich in phytoestrogens, little information is available
about the actual phytoestrogen concentrations in the general
US population. Phytoestrogen excretion in urine varies with
the type of diet (Adlercreutz et al., 1986; Hutchins et al.,
1995a, b; Horn-Ross et al., 1997). Sources for lignans
include whole grains, flax, and some fruits and vegetables.
Isoflavone diets consist primarily of legumes, such as
soybeans and soy-based products (Adlercreutz et al., 1991;
Kirkman et al., 1995; Hutchins et al., 1995a, b). The
phytoestrogens are ingested in their natural beta-glycosidic
forms, which are hydrolyzed to their aglycones in the
intestine, absorbed, and then glucuronidated in the intestinal
wall. The major circulating forms of the isoflavones are the
glucuronidated metabolites, and the glucuronidated forms
also predominate in the urine (Setchell et al., 2001). The half-

lives of the phytoestrogens are reported to be in the range of
3­10 h (Setchell et al., 2001). Previous studies have reported
urinary phytoestrogen levels in various populations, but they
only examined a very few people in each population
(Adlercreutz et al., 1995). The largest reported phytoestrogen
exposure assessment study measured urinary levels of
phytoestrogens in an ethnically diverse population of 50
young women in one geographic area, the San Francisco Bay
Area (Horn-Ross et al., 1997). We measured the serum and
urinary levels of the lignans (matairesinol, enterolactone, and
enterodiol); isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, O-desmethylan-
golensin (O-DMA), and equol); and coumestrol (in urine
only) in a larger and more geographically diverse US
population of adults of different race/ethnicity and both
genders with different dietary habits.
Materials and methods
Study subjects
Urine and serum samples were obtained from a subset of
samples from adult participants of the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1988­
1994. This subset was chosen at random from individuals
who volunteered to give an extra blood and urine sample.
The samples were taken at various times of the day and do
not represent fasting samples. This population subset was not
designed to be representative of the US population but rather
to serve as a reference range group of civilian, noninstitutio-
nalized adults, age 20­58 years (mean of 36.7710.2 years).
The gender distribution was 61% female. Race/ethnicity of
these samples was as follows: non-Hispanic white 29%; non-
Hispanic black 43%; Mexican American 23%; and other
5%. The paired urine and serum samples from 66 people
were simply based on the availability of samples for which we
had adequate volume of both matrices.
Method
Randomly selected urine (N ¼ 199) and serum (N ¼ 208)
samples were analyzed for phytoestrogens using solid-phase
extraction (SPE) followed by HPLC and tandem mass
spectrometry, as previously described (Valenti´n-Blasini et al.,
2000). All of these samples had been stored at À701C since
collection. Genistein, coumestrol, and daidzein were pur-
chased from Indofine Chemical (Somerville, NJ, USA). The
remaining phytoestrogens and the labeled phytoestrogens,
except for daidzein, were purchased from Professor Kristina
Wa
¨ ha
¨ la
¨ of the University of Helsinki, Finland; daidzein was
purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover,
MA, USA). All samples were spiked with a mixture of stable
isotope labeled internal standards, isotopic purity: ([2H6
]-
enterolactone, 490%; [2H6
]-enterodiol, 490%; [2H6
]-
matairesinol, 95%; [2H4
]-equol, 90%; [2H5
]-O-DMA,
80%; [2H3
]-daidzein, 97%; and [2H4
]-genistein, 90%), and
deconjugation internal standards (4-methylumbelliferone
glucuronide and 4-methylumbelliferone sulfate, Sigma Che-
mical, St. Louis, MO, USA). Serum was diluted and
buffered with ammonium acetate (1 ml of 250 mM, pH 5).
Conjugated analytes were hydrolyzed by the addition of b­
glucuronidase/sulfatase (Helix pomatia, H-1, Sigma Chemi-
cal) and incubated overnight at 371C. Serum deconjugated
samples were extracted with Oasis HLB SPE (60 mg HLB,
3 ml, Waters Scientific, Beverly, MA), and urine samples
were extracted using C18 SPE column (Varian 500 mg, 3 ml,
120 mm pore size); the concentrated extract was resuspended
in mobile phase. The phytoestrogens in the extracted samples
were separated by reversed-phase HPLC (50 mm Prism
column, Keystone Scientific, Bellafonte, PA, USA) and
measured by tandem mass spectrometry (Sciex API III,
Perkin-Elmer Sciex Instruments, Wellesley, MA, USA) using
heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in
the negative ion mode.
Urinary concentrations of the phytoestrogens are reported
as nanograms of phytoestrogen per milliliter of urine (ng/ml)
and as micrograms of phytoestrogens per gram of urinary
creatinine (mg/g); serum concentrations are reported as ng/
ml. Quality control samples (spiked serum or urine) and
standards were analyzed along with unknown samples. To
diminish the high degree of skewness of the data, the
concentrations (mg/g creatinine) were graphed using a
logarithmic scale. Geometric means were determined with
the values corrected by urinary creatinine concentrations.
For statistical purposes, nondetectable values were treated as
the limit of detection divided by two (LOD/2). Detection
limits were in the low ng/ml (Valenti´n-Blasini et al., 2000).
Statistical analysis of the correlation of each of the
phytoestrogen concentrations in urine and serum from the
same individuals was performed using a Spearman's rank
correlation analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis (annual
income, education, age, ethnicity, rural or urban residence,
and gender) was accomplished using PROC GLM in SAS
(SAS User's Guide: Statistics, 1982 Edition. SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Urinary Levels of Phytoestrogens
Urinary levels (in ng/ml) of phytoestrogens in our reference
group are summarized in Table 1. Since coumestrol was
detected in only nine urine samples, its data are not
presented. The highest mean level (512 ng/ml) was observed
for enterolactone, a lignan, followed by the isoflavanoids,
daidzein (317 ng/ml) and genistein (129 ng/ml). The lowest
mean level was found for the lignan, matairesinol (15 ng/ml),
which metabolizes to enterolactone. Figure 1 presents the
distribution of the phytoestrogen levels on a creatinine-
adjusted basis in this nonrepresentative, but multiethnic,

population subset. For comparisons among the various
demographic factors, the urinary creatinine-adjusted data
were log transformed because the data were not normally
distributed, but were right-skewed.
Within our reference range population, we observed the
highest levels of phytoestrogens in non-Hispanic whites, with
the exception of matairesinol being found highest in non-
Hispanic blacks. Statistically significant differences among
ethnic groups were observed only for equol (p ¼ 0.0001) and
matairesinol (p ¼ 0.019). For equol, the levels were signifi-
cantly higher in non-Hispanic whites followed by non-
Hispanic blacks (p ¼ 0.0002). For matairesinol, the levels
were significantly higher in non-Hispanic blacks than in
Mexican Americans (p ¼ 0.0035).
Data analysis regarding urinary levels of lignans revealed
several statistically significant findings. The lignans present in
highest urinary concentrations, enterolactone, and entero-
diol, showed significant interaction with income, gender, and
age. For enterolactone, data analysis showed a significant
interaction (p ¼ 0.046) between gender and income, and a
nominally significant interaction (p ¼ 0.0646) between educa-
tion and income. For males with 12 or fewer years of
education, enterolactone urinary levels decreased proportion-
ally with increasing income; conversely, for females with 12
or fewer years of education, enterolactone levels increased
proportionally with increasing income. For males with more
than 12 years of education, enterolactone levels increased
proportionally with increasing income, but at half the rate of
females with more than 12 years of education. Data analysis
for enterodiol showed that the levels of enterodiol increase as
income increases. Similar to the enterolactone data, the
increase is much larger for females than for males and also
much larger for persons living in urban areas, compared to
those living in rural areas. The enterodiol levels increase
for persons with more than 12 years of education but not
for persons with 12 or fewer years of education. There is
a significant interaction between gender and residence
(p ¼ 0.0150) for enterodiol, with urban males having lower
levels than rural males, but urban females having higher
levels than rural females. Matairesinol showed significant
interaction between education and residence. On average,
urban subjects with 12 or fewer years of education had higher
levels than urban subjects with more education, but the
reverse was true for rural residents.
Data analysis on isoflavone levels provided far fewer
significant findings. In fact, the major isoflavones, daidzein
and genistein, showed no significant correlations with any of
the demographic variables examined. O-Desmethylangolen-
sin showed significant interaction among income, gender, and
age. For the younger group of adults, O-DMA urinary levels
decreased proportionally with increasing income, while for

cantly higher (p ¼ 0.0242) in rural residents than in urban
residents.
Serum Levels of Phytoestrogens
Phytoestrogen levels were quantified in 208 serum samples,
and their levels are summarized in Table 2. The serum levels
of the phytoestrogens are several times less than the
respective urinary levels. The highest serum mean levels were
observed for the isoflavones, genistein (4.7 ng/ml) and
daidzein (3.9 ng/ml). For the lignans, enterolactone was
present in highest amounts (mean of 3.6 ng/ml) followed by
enterodiol (mean of 1.8 ng/ml). Concentrations of equol and
matairesinol were below our limit of detection.
Correlation between Urinary and Serum Levels
From the total samples analyzed (401), 132 consisted of
paired samples (urine and serum samples collected at the
same setting from the same individual) from 66 individuals.
Figure 2 presents a scatter plot for enterolactone showing the
relation between serum levels and creatinine corrected urinary
levels for these 66 people. Table 3 summarizes the Spearman
coefficients obtained for the concentrations of different
phytoestrogens in urine and serum samples taken from the
same 66 individuals.
Discussion
We report urinary and serum concentrations of selected
phytoestrogens in this NHANES III subset of adults living in
the US. Previous studies have reported urinary and serum
phytoestrogens levels for various populations. Most of these
studies focused on populations of specific ethnic groups,
dietary habits and/or gender, and with a low number of
subjects (Herman et al., 1995). Even though our results do
not represent the composition of the general population, our
reported values are from a diverse adult US population, a
broader population base than previous studies. Of the eight
phytoestrogens we measured, the highest arithmetic mean
urinary levels were observed for enterolactone (512 ng/ml),
daidzein (317 ng/ml), and genistein (129 ng/ml) (Table 1).
The finding of enterolactone having the highest levels in this
subsample is consistent with a general US diet that is higher
in whole grains or cereals than in soybean sources of
phytoestrogens. The large difference in the concentrations of
these phytoestrogens between the 75th percentile and the
maximum levels is probably due to a relatively small number
of people taking food supplements containing these phytoes-
trogens or having a dietary intake with very high concentra-
tions of them. Owing to the skewness of the data, it may
be more important to estimate the general population by
examining the geometric means or medians (50th percentile)
(Table 1), which both decrease in the same order as the
means. In the case of coumestrol, only nine urine samples
had detectable amounts suggesting a very low dietary
exposure to this phytoestrogen.
To compare our urinary phytoestrogen results with those
of previous studies, we transformed the geometric mean
values (mg/g creatinine) to similar units used in these studies

(mmol/day). Assuming an average excretion amount per day
for creatinine of 2.145 g, the values were converted to mmol/
day (Diem and Geigy, 1962). Levels of the lignan
enterolactone (1.04 mmol/day) were similar to the published
levels for Latina women in the San Francisco Bay Area
(SFBA) study (Horn-Ross et al., 1997) and for Japanese
men and women (0.9 mmol/day) (Adlercreutz et al., 1995).
On the other hand, they were approximately two times lower
than published levels reported in omnivorous US and
Finnish women. Levels of enterodiol (0.16 mmol/day) were
similar to those found in post-menopausal omnivorous and
lacto-ovovegetarian US women but were two to three times
lower than for Japanese men and women. The enterodiol
levels were two times higher than in Latina women in the
SFBA study but four times lower than in white SFBA
women. The levels were similar to the levels for persons
consuming a soy experimental diet that was high in
isoflavones and low in lignans (Kirkman et al., 1995).
For the isoflavone, genistein (0.22 mmol/day), the levels
were two times higher than in persons exposed to a
carotenoid or cruciferous experimental diet and six times
lower than those eating a soy diet. The carotenoid diet and
cruciferous diet correspond to a diet with a higher intake of
lignans and minimum amount of isoflavones. The levels
obtained in our population reflect a diet with a low isoflavone
exposure. When compared with the SFBA study, the levels
were similar to white US women but three times lower than
in Latina and four times higher than in African-American
women. For daidzein (0.49 mmol/day), similar values have
been observed for vegetarian Finnish women and SFBA
Latina women. The levels were higher than levels reported
for a carotenoid experimental diet but lower than a
cruciferous diet. The levels were dramatically lower than
reported for a soy diet. For example, Japanese women
consuming approximately 16 and 30 mg/day of daidzein,
equol, and genistein excreted approximately 3000­5000 mg/l
of each of these isoflavones in their urine (Arai et al., 2000).
For O-DMA (0.049 mmol/day) the levels were similar to
Japanese in the SFBA; two times higher than in white in
SFBA, Helsinki, and Boston omnivorous women; two times
lower than in vegetarians in Boston; and nine times lower
than macrobiotics in the same study. Compared with a soy
experimental diet, the levels of O-DMA in our population
were seven times lower. The relation between the dose and
urinary excretion is linear for many of the phytoestrogens
measured, except for equol (Karr et al., 1997). Since
excretory half-lives are reported to be in the range of 3­
10 h (Setchell et al., 2001), urinary levels reflect recent
consumption.
In general, in our study the concentrations for lignans
correlate with levels reported for other populations, while the
isoflavone concentrations in our study reflect a diet low in
isoflavones. If we compare our population subset in terms of
the different ethnic groups with a study also conducted in the
US, the SFBA study, the following is observed. In our study,
the levels of the isoflavones found in non-Hispanic whites
(n ¼ 55) were two to five times higher, while the levels of the
lignans were three times lower than in the SFBA population
group (n ¼ 15). For non-Hispanic blacks (n ¼ 83), the
isoflavones in our subset were two to five times higher while
the lignans were two times lower. For Mexican Americans
(n ¼ 45), the reverse is observed: the lignans were one to two
times higher in our group, but the isoflavones, genistein and
daidzein, were two to three times lower. O-Desmethylango-
lensin was consistently higher in our population subset; in
particular, Mexican Americans had three times higher levels
than the Latina group (n ¼ 15) in the SFBA study.
The geometric mean concentrations in our study were
obtained from an ethnically diverse population, representing
a broad distribution of dietary habits, ages, incomes, and
residences that could explain possible differences between the
values. Most of the differences within population could be
attributed to different dietary habits. Other factors could
contribute to the observed differences, such as basal diet
composition, phytoestrogen content of plant foods or food
products consumed by residents of different geographic
areas, as well as cultural differences in food composition,
preparation and consumption. Factors other than dietary
intake, such as metabolism by intestinal bacteria, endogenous
hormones, and antibiotic use also influence phytoestrogens'
excretion (Adlercreutz et al., 1986). Gut absorption of
phytoestrogens is influenced by the composition of gut
microflora, which is influenced by dietary habits, and it could
differ between two persons eating the same diet (Knight and
Eden, 1996). For example, some persons cannot metabolize
daidzein to equol, resulting in a low equol excretion.
Daidzein metabolism to equol varies considerably among
people and is influenced by other dietary components, such
as carbohydrate intake. High carbohydrate intake leads to
higher production of equol than does low carbohydrate
intake (Setchell and Cassidy, 1999; Bennetau-Pelissero et al.,
2000). In the NHANES III population, variables like this
could not be assessed, which could contribute additional
information to the interpretation of differences between
different populations and possibly add insight in the broad
variability observed. However, we did observe that the ratio
of daidzein to equol urinary levels was less in Mexican
Americans (5.7) and non-Hispanic whites (6.4) compared to
non-Hispanic blacks (13.2), suggesting lesser conversion of
daidzein to equol in the latter population. We also observed
that for all ethnic groups, the ratios of enterodiol to
enterolactone, which can interconvert, were less than 1. This
finding of higher excretion amounts of enterolactone is in
agreement with other human studies (Adlercreutz et al.,
1986; Kirkman et al., 1995). Females tended to have
marginally higher levels of enterodiol and lower levels of
enterolactone, while the opposite was true for males.
Differences might be related to variations in the composition

of the colonic bacteria affecting the further oxidation of
enterodiol to enterolactone or to a higher intake of
enterodiol. Similar results were observed in a study of lignan
and isoflavonoid urinary excretion in men and women
consuming the same diets (Kirkman et al., 1995).
The concentrations of the phytoestrogens were much lower
in serum than in urine (Tables 1 and 2), which points to the
fast clearance of these chemicals from the body. In addition,
a higher number of samples had nondetectable concentra-
tions in serum than urine. For matairesinol and equol,
nondetectable concentrations were obtained for most of the
serum samples. Detectable levels of equol in serum have been
reported in previous studies, but the reported values were
below our method's limit of detection (Adlercreutz
et al., 1993; Whitten and Patisaul, 2001). Time of collection
of the blood sample is an important variable for the
determination of phytoestrogens because of their short half-
lives (King and Bursill, 1998). NHANES III obtained
samples from the subjects without consideration of elapsed
time after meals.
The range of levels in serum for the multiethnic population
covers one to three orders of magnitude depending on the
analyte. The highest mean level of 4.7 ng/ml was observed for
genistein, followed by daidzein with 3.9 ng/ml, and enter-
olactone with 3.6 ng/ml. When compared with other
populations, total isoflavone concentrations, except for
equol, were approximately two to five times higher than the
values reported for omnivorous Finnish women, and two to
three times lower than levels observed for vegetarian Finnish
women. For lignans in our study, enterolactone was
approximately three times lower, and enterodiol was two
times higher than the values reported for omnivorous Finnish
women (Adlercreutz et al., 1993).
Highly significant correlations of the levels in serum and
urine were observed in the 66 people with matched serum and
urine samples for daidzein, enterodiol, enterolactone, and
genistein (Table 3). All Spearman correlation coefficients
were significantly different from zero (p ¼ 0.0001, except for
O-DMA p ¼ 0.0007). Since the method was not adequately
sensitive for detecting equol and matairesinol in serum, these
levels could not be compared with urinary levels. The high
correlations between urine and serum levels for the other
measured phytoestrogens suggest that urine levels can be used
to assess phytoestrogen human exposure without the need for
invasive phlebotomy, especially in cases where it is difficult to
obtain a blood sample, for example, infant exposure studies.
The values reported here provide a reference range for a
multiethnic adult US population. The differences in phy-
toestrogen levels between ethnic groups might be largely
influenced by differences in dietary intake and/or metabo-
lism. The high correlation observed for urinary and serum
levels validates that noninvasive collection techniques, such as
those used for urine, can be used to assess phytoestrogen
exposure. The assessment of phytoestrogen exposure in large
populations will help elucidate the potential role of
phytoestrogens in protecting against hormone-dependent
diseases. This study increases insight into the actual dietary
exposure to these biologically active compounds in the US
population.
