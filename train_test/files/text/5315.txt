Background
In September of 2010, the first truly "dual campus" high
school was opened in Alberta. The school was a remarkable
example of what can be achieved when people from various
stakeholder groups come together and plan for communal
action. It also provides an example of innovation and growth
within the proposed structural organization of a school.
When Holy Spirit School Division officials and Catholic
Central High School personnel began to explore what struc-
ture they wanted to see in the design of a new Catholic high
school, they came to the realization that to maximize student
programming, the idea of a "dual campus" high school
should be investigated. They realized that the existing high
school, even though it had run out of the space required to
increase program options for its students, still offered pro-
gram specialties that could not be duplicated in a new facility
at the same time as introducing new areas of interest for stu-
dents. The educators and school officials struck upon the
idea of keeping the school as one even though the campuses
would be located on opposite sides of the city. The original
school was to become Campus East and, the new structure,
Campus West.
Now that both campuses are open, it is important to see
whether the organizational structure of the school will
serve the needs of the students and the teachers. It is also
important to see whether this is a model that could serve
other communities who may be struggling with maximiz-
ing the programming options for their students. Finally,
given the current interest in 21st-century learning, and the
concept that learning takes place in many environments
and should not be restricted, it would be interesting to
determine whether students can embrace the idea of "one
school, two buildings."
Theoretical Framework
During the design phase of this study, a rather exhaustive
survey was completed where we looked for research dealing
with what we would come to call a dual campus philosophy.
Research into the area of schools existing on multiple sites
and the impact that the resulting organizational structure had
on students and staff was limited. The quest then for a litera-
ture review that would form the theoretical framework for
this study had to take a different tack than just looking at
what other researchers discovered about the impact of cam-
pus structure. Issues of student engagement, staff efficacy,

Dual Campus High School: A Study to
Determine the Impact of a Multicampus
High School on Student Engagement,
Student Success, and Faculty Efficacy
Carmen P. Mombourquette1
Abstract
September 2010 witnessed the opening of the first complete dual campus high school in Alberta. Catholic Central High
School, which had been in existence since 1967 in one building, now offered courses to students on two campuses. The
"dual campus" philosophy was adopted so as to ensure maximum program flexibility for students. The philosophy, however,
was destined to affect student engagement and staff efficacy as the change in organizational structure, campus locations,
and course availability was dramatic. Changing school organizational structure also had the potential of affecting student
achievement. A mixed-methods study utilizing engagement surveys, efficacy scales, and interviews with students and teachers
was used to ascertain the degree of impact. The results of the study showed that minimal impact occurred to levels of
student engagement, minor negative impact to staff efficacy, and a slight increase to student achievement results.

and the connection between student engagement and aca-
demic achievement needed to be explored to set the stage for
looking at the impact of the change in structure and makeup
of the school. In other words, will the change in the structure
of the school change the student perceptions of engagement,
staff sense of efficacy, and what will be the overall impact on
student academic achievement?
Fortunately, we had access to student and staff data for the
3 years prior to the opening of the second campus. From that
data, we were able to make interpretations about the levels of
engagement, staff efficacy, and student academic perfor-
mance for pre- and postdual campus perspectives.
Student Engagement
The topic of student engagement has become a well-
researched item. So much so, that Levin (2010) stated,
"Engaging students in secondary school appears to be a con-
cern in schools around the world" (p. 89). A 2005 report
from the National Research Council (NRC) suggests that a
focus on engagement calls attention to the connection
between a student and the social context in which learning
takes place, namely, the school. The NRC (2005) report
stated,
Successful high school reforms convey high expectations and
promote a sense of competence in a student's ability to succeed,
feelings of control over academic outcomes, beliefs in the value
of education, and a sense of belonging and respect. Effective
schools and effective teachers provide support and help students
understand what it takes to learn and succeed in school. (p. 3)
Even John Dewey (1938), at the turn of the previous cen-
tury, emphasized the important link that existed between stu-
dent engagement and student learning.
While in Canada, under the direction of the Canadian
Education Association (CEA), tremendous gains have been
made in developing an understanding of the connection
between student engagement and student success in school.
The Willms, Friesen, and Milton (2009) report, commis-
sioned by the CEA, defined student engagement as
the extent to which students identify with and value schooling
outcomes, have a sense of belonging at school, participate in
academic and non-academic activities, strive to meet the formal
requirements of schooling, and make a serious personal
investment in learning. (p. 7)
Finn and Voelkl (1993) looked at 6,488 high school stu-
dents across the United States and their engagement in
school. Engagement in this study was defined in terms of
participation and identification with the school. The research-
ers looked at the role of school structure, regulatory environ-
ment, and racial/ethnic composition of the students and staff.
The most salient results were found in relation to school
structure. It was found that students who went to a small
school attended more regularly, were more likely to partici-
pate while at school, and identified their school as a warmer
place. The study was conducted with students at risk for
dropping out of high school and succumbing to delinquency.
It showed that engagement was an important factor in keep-
ing youth in school and suggested ways to increase student
engagement.
Lee and Smith (1995) built on the understanding of the
connection between student engagement and student learn-
ing by looking at the effects of school reform and school
restructuring on student achievement and engagement. The
Lee and Smith study examined two types of school organiza-
tions: bureaucratic and communal. Many of the restructuring
efforts in American schools aimed at making a shift from
bureaucratic (comprehensive) high schools to smaller com-
munal schools. Although many schools claimed to be mak-
ing efforts to reform their schools, only some schools actually
had reform processes effectively in place. The results of the
study found that students at schools with a variety of reform
practices experienced achievement and learning gains. They
also found that these achievement gains were more equally
distributed among members of the school than in nonreform
schools. The same findings were found in regard to student
engagement. In schools that attempted reform processes but
did not follow through with them or did not put in a valiant
effort, the reform process could actually be harmful and lead
to reduced engagement and achievement. Lee and Smith
suggested that reform processes that support personal and
sustained connection between students and adults appear to
be what is important.
Yazzie-Mintz (2006) found that many factors contributed
to student engagement, including relationship with adults in
the building, feeling safe in the school, and interest in school
activities and classes. Yazzie-Mintz concluded that students
want to feel as though their voices are heard when they ren-
der opinions about what makes high school effective to them.
The researcher reported that many students felt that their
answers on questionnaires and surveys would not be taken
seriously or effect change. The key message from this study
was that when making school reforms, administrators should
take into consideration student ideas about what needs to be
changed and integrate them into the reform strategies. If stu-
dents do not feel as though they have been heard, they are
less likely to be engaged in the school community.
Not all schools engage students in similar ways. Willms et
al. (2009) argued that schools differ substantially in what
they do to promote student engagement. The differences in
approach and the resulting changes in the levels of engage-
ment affect student performance. Furthermore, they state,
"that differences among schools have less to do with stu-
dents' family backgrounds than they do with school policies
and practices, particularly with the learning climate" (Willms
et al., 2009, p. 31).

Teacher Efficacy
Teachers'belief in their ability to positively affect the growth
and education of their students lies at the heart of the "effi-
cacy" term. Bandura (1993) related the understanding of the
term self-efficacy to students, individual teachers, and teach-
ers collectively when he stated,
There are three different levels at which perceived self-efficacy
operates as an important contributor to academic development.
Students' beliefs in their efficacy to regulate their own learning
and to master academic activities determine their aspirations,
level of motivation, and academic accomplishments. Teachers'
beliefs in their personal efficacy to motivate and promote
learning affect the types of learning environments they create
and the level of academic progress their students achieve.
Faculties' beliefs in their collective instructional efficacy
contribute significantly to their schools' level of academic
achievement. (p. 1)
Tschannen-Moran and Hoy (2001) reviewed the existing
measures of teacher efficacy and sought to develop a new
and more comprehensive measure. They explored the exist-
ing definitions and concluded that teacher efficacy is a con-
textual and subject-matter-specific measure of a teacher's
judgment of his or her capacity to facilitate learning and
engagement in students. Tschannen-Moran and Hoy devel-
oped the Ohio State Teacher Efficacy Scale (OSTES). They
found that teachers' efficacy beliefs would transfer to the
extent that they perceive similarity in the task resources and
constraints from one teaching situation to another. Therefore,
when the teaching task is changed, teacher efficacy should
also be reassessed to determine any corresponding changes.
Teacher efficacy has an impact on student engagement/moti-
vation, student achievement, and student self-efficacy.
Goddard, Hoy, and Hoy (2000) explored the meaning of
collective teacher efficacy. Goddard et al. reported that col-
lective teacher efficacy is more than the sum of teacher indi-
vidual efficacy. It is an emergent property based on the
dynamics of the group. Therefore, they found collective
teacher efficacy to be the extent to which the teachers in a
school as a whole believe that they as a group are able to
teach and engage students. High teacher efficacy leads to the
acceptance of challenging goals, strong organizational effort,
and a persistence that leads to better performance, including
higher academic achievement.
That teachers make major differences in the educational
lives of students is certainly not a new idea (Creemers, 1994;
Creemers & Kyriakides, 2004; Hill & Flynn, 2006; Marzano,
Pickering, & Pollock, 2001; Willms et al., 2009). What is
starting to become apparent is that teachers'role may be even
more important than students' family background (Willms et
al., 2009). Individual teachers make a great deal of difference
when it comes to affecting student achievement. Collective
teacher work, where teachers throughout the building col-
laborate and share in the experience of improved practice
will have an even greater impact on students (Garet, Porter,
Desimone, Birman, & Suk Yoon, 2001; Penuel, Fishman,
Yamaguchi, & Gallagher, 2007).
Connection Between Engagement and Student
Academic Success
Student disengagement is a serious issue in schools through-
out Canada. In a 2011 report from the CEA, Dunleavy and
Willms (2011) reported that of 67,248 Grade 5 to 12 students
surveyed, only 70% are socially engaged in school. They
also report that roughly 70% get to their classes on time, or
even make it to school at all. The numbers start to get a little
starker when the issue of being engaged in learning is
assessed. They refer to a serious emotional and cognitive
investment in learning as intellectual engagement. Dunleavy
and Willms then report 42% of Grade 10 students, 41% of
Grade 11 students, and 45% of Grade 12 young men and
women as being intellectually engaged. Klem and Connell
(2004) indicated, "By high school, as many as 40% to 60%
of all students--urban, suburban, and rural--are chronically
disengaged from school" (p. 262).
Lonczak, Abbott, Hawkins, Kosterman, and Catalano
(2002) pointed out that when students feel connected to
the school, we see less use of narcotic substances, lower
levels of social distress and violence, and fewer instances
of teenage pregnancies, whereas Schapps (2003) reported
the same is true for instances of skipping. When students
feel connected to school, there is less likelihood that they
will be truant. Similarly, Wentzel (1998) made the link
between students succeeding academically, with the
resulting higher graduation rates, when students are con-
nected to school.
Research Objectives/Purpose
Now that the dual campus school is open, and students are
receiving instruction in two buildings rather than one, it was
important to see whether the organizational structure of the
school serves the needs of the students in the way that the
originators planned. It is also important to see whether this is
a model that could serve other communities who may be
dealing with their own issues surrounding programming
options for their students. Finally, given the current interest
in 21st-century learning, and the concept that learning takes
place in many environments and should not be restricted, it
becomes necessary to determine whether students can
embrace the idea of "one school, two buildings."
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine
whether a dual campus organizational structure had an
impact on student engagement and teacher efficacy while
4 SAGE Open
also ascertaining whether there is a correlation between these
two variables and overall student academic achievement and
performance. Specifically, the following research questions
are addressed:
Research Question 1: What impact has the movement
toward a dual campus school had on student
engagement?
Research Question 2: What impact has the movement
toward a dual campus school had on the teachers'sense
of efficacy?
Research Question 3: What impact has the movement
toward a dual campus school had on the courses stu-
dents complete in their high school program?
Research Question 4: What impact has the movement
toward a dual campus school had on student academic
performance as determined by overall grade point
average (GPA)?
Importance of Study
Catholic Central High School and Holy Spirit School
Division tried an organizational structure that was nothing
short of being radical. It had the potential to serve as a model
for other schools and school divisions faced with similar
issues. However, before it could serve as a model, its impact
first needed to be studied. Looking at how programming has
changed and whether students feel as, less, or more engaged;
whether student academic performance has increased, stayed
the same, or decreased; and whether teachers continue to feel
that their work influences the lives of students, all in relation-
ship to programming, provide the story other schools will
need before they decide on such a radical change to meet
their students' needs. This project demanded thinking
"beyond the box." The challenges inherent in a dual campus
ranged from transportation to communication--from how
will students and staff be transported between campuses to
how will students be kept connected to all that is offered at
the school. A concept such as this demanded answers to
questions that were not even considered in the initial devel-
opment of the plan.
Method
The study was of the mixed-methods type and entailed quan-
titative and qualitative data gathering. Quantitative came
from surveys already administered within the School
Division--the Teacher Schollie Survey, the Student Schollie
Survey, as well as the Accountability Survey of Students and
Staff. It also came from two new surveys that were adminis-
tered in 2011--the OSTES to determine the level of teacher
efficacy and the Tell Them From Me Survey as a measure of
student engagement. Diploma examination results along
with data for school completion rates, graduation rates, and
drop-out rates were also used. Results from the 3 years prior
to the opening of Campus West were used as baseline data.
Qualitative data came from interviews with students and
staff. They provided the personal piece that gave voice to
the study. Interviews took place in January and February of
2011.
Participants
Student enrollment in the 2010-2011 school year, the 1st
year of the dual campus philosophy implementation, was
856. There were 45 teachers on staff during this 1st year of
implementation. Of the 856 students, 319 (all students were
invited to complete the survey) took part in the Student
Schollie Survey, whereas 38 teachers (all teachers were
invited to complete the survey) completed the Teacher
Schollie Survey. The Tell Them From Me Survey had 179
student participants. The Teacher Efficacy Scale was com-
pleted by 21 teachers. In total, 19 students and 14 teachers
were interviewed.
Sampling Procedures
A member of the Holy Spirit School Division central office
staff was responsible for inviting the students to participate
in the Student Schollie Survey. All students were invited to
participate in the survey. All teachers were given the Teacher
Schollie Survey and asked to participate. Students participat-
ing in the Tell Them From Me Survey were selected ran-
domly.All teachers were given a copy of the Teacher Efficacy
Scale; 21 elected to complete it. Students who were inter-
viewed were selected by School Administration to provide a
diversity of opinion and background. Teachers who were
interviewed were selected on a volunteer basis. All who
wanted to be interviewed were invited to book a time with a
researcher.
Quantitative Measures
The Teacher Schollie Survey and Student Schollie Survey
(collectively referred to as the Schollie Surveys) presented
the best opportunity for making comparative statements.
Schollie Survey information was gathered from the 3 years
prior to the dual campus philosophy coming into operation
and therefore could be compared with the test year. With an
assumption of independence of the group member scores
(e.g., very few/no individuals completed more than one sur-
vey), we conducted one-way ANOVA/Kruskal­Wallis tests
(depending on normality of distribution) to determine the
significance of observed changes in engagement scores for
students and staff over time.
For the student group, we performed multiple regression
and principal components analysis/factor analysis. Multiple
regression was proposed because it served to identify the
relative importance of various independent variables in pre-
dicting school engagement. Regression analyses were run for
each year of data and overall to identify those variables that
consistently emerged as predictors of engagement.

Qualitative Measures
Qualitative data analysis techniques were used in the analy-
sis of the information obtained from the individual student
and teacher interviews. Analysis included the compilation
and review of each interview using a thematic analysis tech-
nique. This involved a data review searching for and refining
the number of themes, which appeared as common threads
throughout the various focus groups.
The following is a pointed form of the analysis that was
used for the qualitative data:
1. Taped interview sessions held with students and
teachers.
2. Interviews transcribed verbatim.
3. First Content review conducted--Themes pulled and
coded by the researcher and aligned with research
questions.
4. Second Content review conducted--Themes orga-
nized into categories.
5. Third Content review conducted--Second researcher
asked to read through interviews and additions made
to theme search.
6. Validation of common themes and analysis con-
ducted for meaning.
7. Finalized themes ready for reporting and inclusion in
report.
The integrity of the data was important, but the interpreta-
tion of the data is what gave credence to its use in this study.
The researchers expended a considerable amount of time and
energy into the analysis, weaving all the data sources into a
comprehensive set of indicators and, in turn, allowed for the
rich text descriptors of what was happening in this case.
Results
Three years prior to the opening of the second campus, a new
principal was appointed along with a new associate princi-
pal. The third administrator at this school was an incumbent.
All three school leaders were in place when the second cam-
pus opened in September of 2010. During the 1st year of new
campus operation, a fourth school administrator was added
to the complement, it should be noted that this person was an
incumbent teacher at the school. The teaching staff remained
relatively constant over the course of the 3 years prior to the
opening of the second campus and during Year 1 of opera-
tions of the dual campus philosophy. Of the 45 teachers on
staff in Year 1 of dual campus, 34 were on staff for the 3
preceding years. Student population was experiencing a
slight, if steady, decline. In 2007-2008, total student enroll-
ment was 941; in 2008-2009, enrollment dipped to 933; in
2009-2010, it was 884; and in 2010-2011 (1st year of dual
campus operation), it was 856. All quantitative analyses
were performed using PASW®18.
Student Engagement
Two measures were used to determine levels of student
engagement. The first came from the results of the Student
Schollie Survey. The second was a new survey called Tell
Them From Me Survey. This second instrument was admin-
istered twice. However, both administrations were in the
2010-2011 school year. For this article only, the data from
the second administration were used.
Student Schollie Survey Results. Kruskal­Wallis test was used
to evaluate whether students' ratings on Student Schollie
Survey questions differed over time. The Kruskal­Wallis test
found significant differences in the mean rank between the
groups for seven of the questions asked. There were differ-
ences in the mean rank between the groups (only four of the
questions related to significance affecting the 2010 cohort
with the 2007, 2008, and/or 2009), 2(3, N = 1,080) = 11.031,
p = .012 for Questions 6, 12, 15, and 20. A post hoc Mann­
Whitney U test with a Bonferroni correction determined that
students from all or one of the 2007, 2008, and 2009 groups
were significantly different from the 2010 group.
Question 6: "My teacher challenges me to do my best."
Students in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 responded simi-
larly to this question; however, there was a trend toward
significance observed between the 2007 and 2010 cohorts
(p = .009). Students in 2010 responded more favorably to
this item than did students from the 2007 cohort.
Question 12: "There are enough learning materials in
my classroom." Students from the 2007 cohort responded
less favorably to this item than did those from the 2010
cohort (p = .001).
Question 15: "I am kept informed of my progress."
Students from the 2007 cohort responded more favorably to
this item than did those from the 2010 cohort (p = .006).
Question 20: "Homework assignments are reasonable."
Students from the 2010 cohort responded more favorably to
this item than did those from the 2007 cohort (p = .001), or
2008 cohort (p < .001), or 2009 cohort (p = .002).
Afactor analysis was used to determine whether there were
a small number of core factors underlying the survey com-
pleted by students from 2007 to 2010. Missing values were
replaced with mean scores leaving 1,082 cases for analysis.
Some of the variables were skewed, but were not transformed
due to the same response options being used for each variable.
Eighty-four multivariate outliers were observed. These cases
were excluded from analysis. Principal components extraction
was used prior to factor analysis to estimate the number of fac-
tors, presence of variable outliers, absence of multicollinearity
and singularity, and factorability of the correlation matrix.
Four factors were extracted using the maximum likelihood
procedure and rotated using a varimax rotation procedure. The
factor loadings yielded four interpretable factors: safe and car-
ing learning environment, religiousness, career path and learn-
ing opportunities, and technology supports for learning. Factor
6 SAGE Open
1 "Safe and caring learning environment" accounted for
32.9% of the item variance, Factor 2 "Religiousness"
accounted for 4.1% of the item variance, Factor 3 "Career sup-
port and learning opportunities" accounted for 2.7% of the
item variance, and Factor 4 "Technological supports for learn-
ing" accounted for 2.5% of the item variance.
Two internal consistency estimates of reliability were
computed for the individual items comprising the factors
"Safe and caring learning environment," "Religiousness,"
"Career path and learning opportunities," and "Technological
supports for learning": a split half coefficient expressed as a
Spearman Brown corrected correlation and coefficient alpha.
For the split half coefficient, the scale was split into two
halves such that the two halves would be as equivalent as
possible. In splitting the items, sequencing was taken into
account and individual items were divided so that both halves
contained a mixture of odd and even items. All four factors
attained better than acceptable reliability values (.7).
The Kruskal­Wallis test found no significant differences
in the mean rank between the year-based cohorts for the vari-
ables--Safe and caring learning environment, 2(3, N = 998)
= 3.8, p = .284; Religiousness, 2(3, N = 998) = 5.35,
p = .148; Career and supportive learning opportunities, 2(3,
N = 998) = 1.89, p = .595; or Technological supports for
learning, 2(3, N = 998) = 3.11, p = .375.
TellThem From Me Survey Results. In June of 2011, students at
this school participated in the Tell Them From Me Survey
conducted by an organization called The Learning Bar
(www.thelearningbar.com). This survey compares the school
with Canadian norms (see Table 1).
Student Academic Achievement.We examined student aca-
demic achievement for the 3 years prior to the study to estab-
lish a baseline for comparison with the 1st year of
implementation of the dual campus philosophy. Table 2 dis-
plays the results as a raw number of Credit Earned Units
(CEUs) and the percentage each category represents of all
courses completed.
School Accountability Data. We examined the school data that
were gleaned from the Provincial Accountability data. This
information is contained in Table 3.
Student Interview Feedback. Students were selected by School
Administration for inclusion as a candidate for interview--
ten Grade 10 students were selected, six Grade 11, and three
Grade 12 students were interviewed. All but one of the stu-
dents had spent some of their years on both campuses. Data
from the students revealed three general themes: transporta-
tion, friends, and opportunities. These items were addressed
by all the students during their interviews. In addition, a
number of lesser themes were identified; some, but not all of
the students, addressed them. These themes included stu-
dent-based decision making, small school atmosphere, bring-
ing students together, and communication.
The students recognized that if the School Division had
simply created a new stand-alone high school on the west
side of the city, then students would not have had access to
all specialty courses that were available in the dual campus
mode. School of choice would have dictated what courses
they would have been able to complete. They also extended
that line of thinking to learning spaces like the gym, sports
fields, fitness center, hallways, cafeteria, and classrooms.
Students understood the importance of having these spaces
available to all and not be reserved just for the students who
happened to attend that particular building. We could inter-
pret from the responses of the students interviewed that they
understood the logic of increased opportunity as a rationale
for the dual campus philosophy.
Students also identified two general themes where they
felt that dual campuses interfered with their lives. Being sep-
arated from their friends and transportation were issues for
the students. The money charged by the School Division for
transportation was identified as being unfair and that it cre-
ated a negative image about the dual campus. Transportation
was viewed as necessary for getting them back and forth
between the buildings, and they were not to be charged.
Noon hour transportation was an issue--catching the bus on
time and missing opportunities to be with friends. A number
of students also identified the confused nature of the trans-
portation system at the start of the year. However, students
also appreciated that as the year went on, the system
improved.
Student Survey Question 5 had the students think about
the rationale for creating a dual campus rather than two
stand-alone schools. The question presented a preamble that
highlighted the ideas of increased course and extracurricular
options available in the dual campus philosophy. They were
then asked to weigh this idea against creating two stand-
alone schools where students would always be together with
their friends yet may not have the courses or extracurricular
specialties available. When asked this question, 17 students
said they preferred the dual campus, 2 said they would rather
have the single school even if it meant less courses and extra-
curricular options. The following are direct quotes from what
they said:
I prefer the dual campus because even though I have to transfer
between schools I get more opportunities to do different things
like preengineering class. I'm taking pre-engineering and it
wouldn't have been available without the dual campus. (Student
1)
I definitely would want the two campuses because you know the
traveling is annoying but it's not so annoying that you wouldn't
want all of the opportunities that you have. (Student 2)
The two campuses . . . the same school on two campuses. I
didn't mind it with the sports cause in Quarter Two I was East in
the morning, West in the afternoon, and then East after school
again. But you don't really . . . you think "oh you're going over
the bridge three or four times a day" it doesn't seem like it. So

I'm able to do a little bit of traveling and still play all of the
sports I want to play. (Student 3)
Well, as I said, there is the problem that some courses are only
offered on one campus. Like in my case, I was forced to go to
the East Campus to get into the math advanced placement
course. So I had to take the bus back and forth between the
campuses but offering more courses, it is good for everyone. I
am glad that I have more options to take . . . I'm really happy
about it. (Student 7)
Especially for Grade 12 kids that are figuring out what program
they want to get into in university or college or whatever. And if
they don't have the chance to find that out then I don't think they
. . . I don't think the one school that has less programs would be
able to help them out very much. (Student 9)
Student 14 related that he or she would have liked to
have seen just one campus and defended that position by
saying,
I'd probably say the one school with less programs. Even though
it's nice with all the new options that we have. But sometimes
it's hard to access them with the whole shuttling thing. So I'd
probably say just the one campus with less options.
Teacher Efficacy
Interpretations about the concept of teacher efficacy, and the
degree to which it changed or remained constant, were made
from data gathered from the Teacher Schollie Survey, the
OSTES, and from teacher interview feedback.
Mombourquette 9
Teacher Schollie Survey Results.The Kruskal­Wallis test
found significant differences in the mean rank scores across
the different years only for Question 21, which was about the
overall communication between the jurisdiction and the
school: 2(2, N = 94) = 8.578, p = .014. There were four miss-
ing values in total--three for 2008/2009 and one for
2010/2011. Missing values were not replaced. Post hoc
Mann­Whitney U tests with a Bonferroni correction deter-
mined that teachers' satisfaction ranking to this question was
significantly lower in 2008 than they were in 2009 or 2010.
Rankings for 2009 and 2010 were similar.
OSTES."Teacher efficacy has proved to be powerfully
related to many meaningful outcomes such as teachers' per-
sistence, enthusiasm, commitment and instructional behav-
iours, as well as student outcomes such as achievement,
motivation, and self-efficacy beliefs" (Tschannen-Moran &
Hoy, 2001, p. 783). These researchers also claim that the
OSTES has the validity and reliability to allow its use in
schools and for interpretations to be made.
Instructional efficacy mentions items related to the ways
in which teachers instructed students. Items pertaining to
assessment, questioning, extra help, teaching strategy diver-
sity, learning levels of students, and appropriate challenges
were assessed in this area.
Management efficacy looked at items related to student
control and the ways in which teachers dealt with behavior.
Items pertaining to behavior, following rules, calming stu-
dents, management systems, defiance, disruption to learning,
and expectations were assessed in this area.
Engagement efficacy meanwhile looked at items related
to setting the conditions necessary to get students to want to
learn. To that end, items pertaining to students believing in
themselves, value of learning, motivation, role of families in
student learning, thinking critically, and fostering creativity
were assessed in this version of the concept.
The norms generated from three separate validity and reli-
ability studies present the following categories of efficacy as
measured by the OSTES: Instruction (M = 7.3, SD = 1.1),
Management (M = 6.7, SD = 1.1), and Engagement (M = 7.3,
SD = 1.1). The OSTES was completed by 21 teachers. The
results for this group of teachers were as follows: Instruction
(M = 7.2, SD = 0.79), Management (M = 7.76, SD = 0.65),
and Engagement (M = 6.6, SD = 0.89).
Teacher Interview Feedback. As with the student responses,
we also see some general themes emerging from across the
responses provided by the teachers. The themes identified
are programming/opportunities for students, organiza-
tional difficulties, and the importance of team atmosphere.
Each of these general themes was made up of subthemes.
The theme of programming/opportunities included new
courses, spaces for students to learn (gym, science labs,
library), and less crowding. The organizational difficulties
theme referred to transportation and travel glitches, lack
of vision as the campuses opened, lack of support from
School Division, and timetabling issues. The theme of
team atmosphere included items like small school atmo-
sphere, feeling part of the organization, confidence in the
ability of staff to make it work, and the pride of doing
something special and new as well as being something that
nobody had ever done before.
Programming-type comments were the most often stated,
positive and negative, about the new system. Teachers identi-
fied the ability of students to take courses that were of inter-
est to them as being the driving force for the construction of
the new school and that it was the reason they were most in
favor of the dual campus philosophy. Included in the pro-
gramming comments were those associated with the useful-
ness of the new learning spaces that came with the building.
The gymnasium, fitness center, science labs, preengineering
lab, and the new library were singled out for special mention
and the positive impact they had on student learning. The
teachers also identified that crowding had been a major issue
in Campus East prior to the second building's opening. The
crowding issues were alleviated with the second building.
Coaches appreciated the availability of the second gym.
Transportation was addressed as a major issue with the
start of the dual campus philosophy. It was identified as the
issue that should have been better thought out prior to open-
ing the second campus. However, teachers also acknowl-
edged that as the year progressed, most of the issues were
rectified. They were clear in their condemnation of charging
students for transportation, as it did not send out a message
of support for the dual campus. Travel was also mentioned in
connection with students and teachers needing to go between
campuses at noon. There was a general sense that this should
not be necessary. The travel issue tied directly into the whole
idea of organizational leadership. Teachers felt that more
technical type issues associated with the dual campuses
could have been rectified with increased communication and
committee type meetings focused on problem solving. Even
though the teachers recognized the shared ownership they
felt in the concept's design, it was a little less evident with
the opening of the second campus itself.
There was a very strong sense of teacher efficacy in the
comments made during the interviews. Teachers spoke about
the pride they had in the creation of something new. They
also acknowledged the importance of the feeling of "team"
that the planning for the dual campus philosophy helped cre-
ate. Teachers addressed the fact that the change allowed the
school to return to a small school environment, only this
time, it was in two buildings rather than one. Yet, they also
expressed comments that indicated that some of that good
feeling associated with the new campus being opened dissi-
pated as the realities of how difficult it would be to make the
system work actually sunk in. There was also a bit of a diver-
gence of opinion between comments made by experienced
teachers and those new to the school. The experienced teach-
ers, those who also played a major role in planning for the
10 SAGE Open
new campus, were much more adamant about how the dual
campus was contributing to the life of the school, the stu-
dents, and to teaching. While new teachers felt the system
was helping students in the school, they also felt that the
work associated with making it work was onerous.
Data, quantitative and qualitative, present evidence of a
system that is working. Students and teachers interviewed
acknowledge some of the growing pains associated with the
change inherent in the dual campus philosophy being imple-
mented. The survey data paint a picture of a continuation of
the existing norms connected to the way in which students
viewed the organization the 3 years prior to dual campus
opening. The same is true for the teacher survey data--con-
tinuation of the norm from the 3 previous years. Attention
now needs to be turned to making sense of these data and
drawing from them statements that can be made in relation to
student engagement impact, teacher efficacy influences, and
student programming connections.
Discussion
In a nutshell, the question of "what has been the impact?"
still needs to be answered. In this section of the article, we
will take a look at what has been the impact on student
engagement, staff efficacy, and student programming options
and achievement.
Student Engagement
The data gleaned from the Schollie Surveys have been infor-
mative in that very little, if any, change occurred in the way
the students perceived their school, the staff, and their place
in the organization. We expected to see a change in the way
students completed the Student Schollie Survey as the stu-
dents of this school just underwent a major change in the
structure of their school. Students, however, answered ques-
tions like, "The staff at my school care about me," "I am
satisfied with the extracurricular activities," "I am satisfied
with the opportunities to make decisions about how I learn,"
"My teachers help me learn," "Students are encouraged to
become involved in school activities," "There is a Christian
attitude among the staff," and "The school provides opportu-
nities for students to become involved in volunteer activities
and community service" in much the same way in 2010 as
they did in any of the 3 previous years. These questions cover
diverse areas of student relationship to the school and the
learning program. They also connect to various understand-
ings of student engagement. The results from this survey
reinforce the findings of the NRC (2005) when they made it
clear, "Successful high school reforms convey high expecta-
tions and promote a sense of competence in a student's abil-
ity to succeed, feelings of control over academic outcomes,
beliefs in the value of education, and a sense of belonging
and respect" (p. 3). Furthermore, the data support the NRC's
conclusion, "Effective schools and effective teachers provide
support and help students understand what it takes to learn
and succeed in school" (p. 3).
The data gleaned from the Tell Them From Me Survey
present evidence of a school community that is attempting to
make a difference in the lives of its students through the
work of its teachers and staff. It is interesting to note that the
school presents as average (the scores for this school are
similar to those in the national sample) for items like
"Students that value school outcomes" or "Students are regu-
larly truant." Yet, this school's results for items that go to the
heart of the teacher­student relationship are significantly
higher than those from the national norm. The evidence from
the Tell Them From Me Survey reinforces what the Student
Schollie Survey data were saying. We can interpret from the
data that the teacher­student relationship is sound, that there
is positive learning climate, and that expectations are high
yet reasonable.
From the interview data, we are able to infer that the stu-
dents are satisfied with the change to the dual campus orga-
nizational structure. They understand the rationale for the
change occurring and are willing to give the school a chance
to make the new structure work for them. However, the
school needs to be aware of some dark clouds on the horizon
when it comes to long-term acceptance of the new order.
First and foremost, the school needs to be aware of the need
to continue to provide opportunities for teachers and students
to connect and to form healthy relationships. To do so, the
transportation issue is going to have to be resolved. Having
students pay for a bus pass to go from one campus to the
other will not be sustainable from the students'point of view,
nor will the continued requirement of students being forced
to move between campuses at the noon hour. In rare cases,
where students want particular teachers, noon hour move-
ment might have to continue. Change needs to happen to cre-
ate opportunities in both buildings for core courses (science,
social studies, English, math, religious studies, etc.) to occur
in such a way that students need only to make the choice of
campus based on the specialty program (pre-engineering,
new media, languages, fine arts, etc.) they want to take. By
keeping student movement at noon hour to the minimum, the
school can then take full advantage of the "Flex Time" that is
built into the system and allow for greater teacher­student
interaction. The school will need to pay attention to teachers
not moving back and forth at the noon hour--for the same
reason that it is not prudent for students. The movement
interferes with the development of the healthy interactions
that build positive school culture.
Second, the students are accepting of the fact that the sec-
ond campus was needed for programming-type issues. That
point appeared as significant in each of the student inter-
views. However, students noted that as the year progressed,
some of that rationale was starting to wear a little thin.
Transportation glitches made the point obvious, but other
less obvious issues like lack of course availability were also
being noted. Foods class was identified as a prime example.
Mombourquette 11
With the new school came a second Foods Lab, yet the num-
ber of sections of Foods dropped from the previous year to
the year of opening. They also recognized that a course with
a large Career and Technology Studies (CTS) lab attached
was not even offered once the new school opened. To keep
the programming issue alive, and well accepted, the school
will need to remain vigilant in its quest to have the specialty
programs available to students.
Third, the students spoke about being involved in the
decision-making process. Yazzie-Mintz (2006) highlighted
the importance of student voice being taken as valuable.
Yazzie-Mintz indicated that valuing student opinion was a
means to increase student engagement. When students
believed that their voices were not being heard, they became
less engaged and in turn less inclined to do well at school.
Being heard may become an issue in the next few years with
this school. Students mentioned in their interviews that since
the start of the new school year, they felt people were too
busy to pay attention to them. The school should be search-
ing for ways for the student voices to be expressed and to be
shown to make a difference in the way the dual campus
evolves.
Fourth, the work of Lee and Smith (1995), even though it is
getting to be dated, provides a sounding board for change and
its impact on students. They highlighted the need for schools
that are attempting large-scale change to be viewed as orga-
nized and focused on making the project successful. Some of
the students noticed that the change to the dual campus organi-
zational structure was not as smooth as it should have been. If
the reform effort is to prove to be long lasting and having a
positive impact on students, then the involvement of students
themselves in the planning process will be required.
Finally, the issue of small school environment showed
through in the feedback from students. They did not address
the issue directly but mentioned in their statements the dif-
ferent "feel" that now existed in the two buildings--less stu-
dents in the hall, more classrooms being available, more
opportunities to talk to teachers--Campus West having a
calming effect on people. The atmosphere of a small school
needs to be addressed and used as an area of strength and
growth within the school culture.
Staff Efficacy
One of the most salient points that arose from the data was
one of the long-standing teachers viewing the move to dual
campus in a much more positive light than teachers new to
the school. Both groups, according to the interview feed-
back, were willing to work with the new organizational
structure and that they could see the positives built into the
system, yet there was a difference in perspective between the
two. Bandura (1993) stated, "Teachers' beliefs in their per-
sonal efficacy to motivate and promote learning affect the
types of learning environments they create and the level of
academic progress their students achieve" (p. 1). The more
experienced teachers spoke about their roles in helping shape
the way the dual campus philosophy was developed and
implemented. They were able to relate the roles they played
individually to the way the project came together in the plan-
ning phases and, in turn, its implementation. The newer
teachers did not have the same track record with the project
and, therefore, interpreted the impact of the change in a more
negative light. Even the experienced teachers, however,
spoke about the need to bring back a greater commitment to
committees and individual teacher input into the running of
the school and making the dual campus philosophy work in
the future.
As we do not have longitudinal data from multiple admin-
istrations of the OSTES, we are careful about drawing too
many conclusions about that aspect of teacher efficacy.
However, we do note the major difference in the Engagement
score from the school norm to that of the norm established in
the OSTES itself. The OSTES mean was 7.3, while the
school's mean was 6.6 when dealing with questions related
to the teachers' impact in helping to get students engaged.
This item will need to be monitored over the next few years.
As with the students, it was interesting to see that in the
Teacher Schollie data, however, there was virtually no differ-
ence in the way the teachers of this school perceived the
school during the 1st year of dual campus operations than the
ways in which they perceived the organization in the previ-
ous 2 years. These data speak about the resiliency of teachers
in accommodating themselves to new ideas, especially if
they have a say in shaping what the idea looks like.
Interview data revealed a number of issues that school
leadership will need to address. Transportation and move-
ment back and forth between the campuses will need to be
studied. Evidence from data suggests that teachers' lives
should be brought into the equation as the school tries to deal
with the issue of movement at noon. Teachers expressed a
need to be on one campus for the day, and that movement
from quarter to quarter would work much better for all
concerned.
The data also suggest that the system is working as well as
it is because the teachers believe it was the best decision the
school could have made. The teachers interviewed were
clear in their desire to not see a separate and discrete school
as being a better option. The teachers also believed that stu-
dent programming was a driving force for the new system
and that collectively they could find ways to better deal with
making the programs work for students. A number of teach-
ers, however, mentioned in their interview that if the school
could not develop more effective ways for teachers to get
together with colleagues, perhaps they would have to revisit
the structure.
Engagement and Student Academic Success
A statistically significant correlation between student
engagement and academic success cannot be made from the
data that we collected. In this study, all we can do is present
some observations.
12 SAGE Open
The theoretical framework of this article presented
research that made connections between the importance of
student engagement and student achievement at school. We
will use their findings to make a generalization that if student
engagement scores go down, so too will their achievement.
That if students feel less connected to the school, believe that
the teachers are not really there to support them, that the
comfort and warmth they feel when they get to school is less-
ened in some way, then a corresponding drop in achievement
will in all likelihood occur (Dewey, 1938; Finn & Voelkl,
1993; Lee & Smith, 1995; NRC, 2005; Willms et al., 2009;
Yazzie-Mintz, 2006).
The data from this study present a picture that student
engagement remained relatively constant in the 1st year of
the dual campus implementation. However, we see some
interesting changes in a number of achievement areas. Table
3 presented the achievement data for the school year 2010-
2011 and compared the results with the 3 previous years.
From these data, we see relatively constant results for items
"safe and caring," "program of studies," and "education
quality." We also noted a healthy increase in "high school
completion rates" and a positive drop in the "drop-out rate,"
while scores associated with student academic achievement
either stayed the same or increased. What is most remarkable
about the achievement scores is a full 2% increase in stu-
dents receiving an acceptable score on their provincial
diploma exams. This score is further highlighted by the fact
that in the same year, the percentage of all students in the
province achieving an acceptable score went down by 1.4%
from the 3-year average.
Programming was also affected by the move to dual cam-
pus. A programming area that achieved a dramatic increase
in student enrollment was that of CTS, an increase that came
in part due to the offering of a preengineering program.
Students flocked to the course. The school had only planned
on offering one or two sections, but, in the end, offered six.
Other areas like fine arts, options, and Registered
Apprenticeship Program and Work Experience (RAP/WE)
remained relatively constant. Languages experienced a
decline in enrollment, one that had been steadily occurring
for the previous 3 years. Core courses (English, science,
math, social studies) also remained relatively constant. From
these data, we can extrapolate that by keeping the two build-
ings together as one school, they were able to achieve conti-
nuity of program. In other words, the dual campus fulfilled
its mandate of keeping programming options for students as
flexible and achievable as possible.
Students remained engaged to the same degree they were
prior to the second campus being implemented, teacher effi-
cacy remained similar to previous years, and student pro-
grammingandachievementremainedconstantorexperienced
a small upswing. We are left with the opinion that the school
was able to achieve that which it set out to do. However, we
must be cognizant that it is too early to draw too many solid
conclusions. For the next 2 years, the surveys will be
readministered, achievement results will be analyzed, and
students and teachers will be interviewed. Future findings
will provide evidence of the impact of the dual campus orga-
nizational structure on student engagement, student achieve-
ment, and teacher efficacy.
