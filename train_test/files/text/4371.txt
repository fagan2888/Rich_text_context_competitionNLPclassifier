Introduction
Glossing has been found as a means of facilitating vocabu-
lary learning and reading comprehension (e.g., Davis, 1989;
Hulstijn, 1992; Jacobs, Dufon, & Hong, 1994; Ko, 2005;
Watanabe, 1997). Glossing in second language (L2) learning
refers to providing a summary of words' meaning in a text
usually found as notes in the margin or between the lines of
the text (Richards & Schmidt, 2010). Glosses can be defini-
tions, interpretations, explanations, or translations. They can
have positive effects on student's vocabulary learning due to
consciousness raising attained from their bolded form, their
availability, shortening the time needed for searching for the
word in the dictionary, and providing the appropriate mean-
ing for glossed words or vocabulary (Hashemian & Fadaei,
2012). Taking into account the positive findings of the effec-
tiveness of marginal glosses, researchers have recently
attempted to determine what types of glosses or glossing
conditions generate more positive effects on L2 learners'
reading comprehension and vocabulary learning (e.g.,
Farvardin & Biria, 2011; Huang & Lin, 2014; Ko, 2012).
Laufer and Hulstijn (2001) proposed Involvement Load
Hypothesis based on which tasks activating need, search,
and evaluation of the meaning of unfamiliar words will lead
to higher vocabulary learning than those which do not trigger
such processes. Moreover, Laufer and Hulstijn argued that
compared with other tasks, glossing does not trigger search
or evaluation processes and encourages weak involvement
load. Recently, Huang and Lin (2014) said that "glossing can
increase the possibility of learning correct word meanings in
context, but leaving words unglossed for learners to infer or
retrieve their word meanings may increase the involvement
load and mental effort, thus contributing to better retention"
(p. 128). Therefore, preceding glossing with inference (i.e.,
guessing a new word's meaning from context) or following
glossing with retrieval (i.e., the act of remembering words'
meaning) may complement vocabulary learning (Rott, 2007).
Retrieval is defined as the ability to recall words or items
after an interval of time (Richards & Schmidt, 2010). It is
also suggested that repeated retrieval would decrease the
possibility of forgetting an item (Nowzan & Baryaji, 2013).
Among studies done on glossing as a means of vocabu-
lary learning, some found that marginal glossing has a posi-
tive effect on vocabulary learning (e.g., Hashemian & Fadaei,

A Comparative Study of the Effects of
Different Glossing Conditions on EFL
Learners' Vocabulary Recall
Tayebeh Danesh1,2 and Mohammad Taghi Farvardin2
Abstract
This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of different glossing conditions on English as a foreign language (EFL)
learners' vocabulary recall. To this end, five glossing conditions were adopted (i.e., inference-gloss-gloss, gloss-retrieval-
gloss, inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval, and full glossing). The participants were 140 MA
students of Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL). They were randomly assigned to one glossing condition to
read an English reading passage. Five target words were glossed in different glossing conditions within a reading passage.
To ensure the participants' attention focused on the reading material, the participants were told that a multiple-choice
reading comprehension test would be administrated. Afterward, two vocabulary tests (i.e., form recall and meaning recall)
were conducted. The results of one-way MANOVAs and the post hoc Scheffé tests revealed that the full glossing condition
group did significantly better than other glossing groups in vocabulary form recall, whereas the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval
condition group outperformed other four groups in vocabulary meaning recall.

2002), whereas some argued that it does not necessarily lead
to vocabulary learning as it does not encourage inferencing
or word meaning retrieval (Huang & Lin, 2014).
The effects of combining inferencing with glossing,
retrieval with glossing, or the effect of combining these three
factors together on L2 vocabulary learning constitute an
important research gap. To help overcome and close this gap,
the present study has been designed to compare the effects of
manipulating three variables (i.e., glossing, inferencing, and
word meaning retrieval) on vocabulary recall of English as a
foreign language (EFL) learners.
Literature Review
There have been a number of studies examining the effect of
glossing on L2 vocabulary recall. In some studies (e.g.,
Peters, 2014; Rott, 2007; Rott et al., 2002), texts were manip-
ulated by increasing the number of word occurrences or pro-
viding additional semantic clues for target words (e.g., first
language [L1] or L2 marginal glosses, appositives, and dic-
tionary access). Table 1 shows a brief description of some
previous studies investigating the effect of glossing condi-
tions and vocabulary recall.
Rott et al. (2002) conducted a study to examine the effect
of L1 multiple-choice marginal glosses, L2 text reconstruc-
tion with opportunities to recheck input, and combination of
these two treatments on vocabulary acquisition and reten-
tion. Seventy-six learners of German were randomly assigned
to one of the four conditions (three experimental and one
control). They were selected from fourth-semester language
classes. Productive and receptive word gains were tested
immediately after the treatment and again 5 weeks later.
Findings revealed that the multiple-choice marginal gloss
treatment resulted in significantly better productive and
receptive word gains immediately after the treatment.
However, 5 weeks later, a significant receptive word gain
was found for the combined treatment condition. Later, Rott
(2007) examined the effect of increasing the frequency of
target words as well as L1 (English) marginal glosses in a
reading text on vocabulary learning. The participants were
54 learners of German who were native speakers of English.
They were selected from four intact fourth-semester lan-
guage classes. Three reading conditions were compared: In
the first condition, the target words were glossed 4 times in
the margin of the text in all word occurrences; in the second
condition, the target words were first glossed, then they were
not glossed (for meaning retention based on the previously
seen gloss), and bolded twice in the third and fourth word
occurrences; and in the third condition, the target words were
glossed for the first occurrence, and then they were bold-
faced without glossing. Rott found that the first and second
reading conditions resulted in more productive word gain
than the third condition where readers were presented with
the target words only once. She finally concluded that the
comprehension of main ideas was the highest when the target
words were glossed 4 times followed by the gloss-bolding
reading condition and the gloss-retrieval task.
In another study, Peters (2014) investigated how form
recall is influenced by repetition (1, 3, or 5 number of occur-
rences), type of target item (single words vs. collocations), and
time of posttest administration (immediately or 1 week after
the learning session) for EFL learners. The participants were
35 first-year EFL business students from two parallel classes
at a Flemish university. The participants' first language was
Dutch. A word list including 12 single words and 12 colloca-
tions accompanied by their English (L2) definition was the
learning material. The participants were asked to do eight writ-
ten vocabulary exercises, in which they had to supply the cor-
rect form (i.e., to provide synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, or
superordinates; to match collocations; to fill in the gap in sen-
tences; to supply the correct item when given a definition) of
the target items. Except for the matching exercise, the partici-
pants always had to provide the target item's form. The

participants' learning was measured via two form recall tests,
which were administered immediately and 2 weeks after the
experimental session. The results showed a large effect of rep-
etition and also the durability of repetition effect in form recall
of target words. Moreover, it was found that collocations were
more difficult to learn than single words.
Nowzan and Baryaji (2013) further examined the effective-
ness of a retrieval task on Iranian EFL learners' vocabulary
learning. They selected 40 EFL learners at the intermediate
level based on their performance on a preliminary English
placement test. Then, a teacher-made vocabulary pretest was
administrated to extract participants' unknown words.
Afterward, the participants were randomly assigned to two
groups: experimental and control groups. The experimental
group was taught target words through a retrieval activity that
consisted of four steps: learning phase in which a list of target
words were presented to the participants with definitions and
synonyms; retrieval activity phase, in which participants were
required to retrieve the target words according to clues con-
sisting of the first letters of target vocabulary; retrieval interval
test phase in which participants were asked to provide the syn-
onym of the target words according to the given clues consist-
ing of first two letters of target words; and posttest phase that
was provided for both controlled and experimental groups to
assess their vocabulary learning. The participants in the con-
trol group received the same content without any retrieval
activity processes above. Finally, a posttest was given in both
groups at the end of the instruction. The results revealed that
retrieval activity had a significant effect on Iranian EFL learn-
ers' vocabulary learning. It was also concluded that repeated
retrieval can help vocabulary learning, and it can be helpful
when long-term retention of information is the goal. They also
suggested that the act of retrieval can fix items in the memory,
improve memory traces, and increase the accessibility of
information in the memory.
In the same vein, Goossens, Camp, Verkoeijen, and Tabbers
(2014) conducted a study on the role of retrieval practice in
Dutch primary school vocabulary learning. To this end, 62
participants were selected from three primary schools; they
were required to learn the meaning of 20 target English words.
The participants learned the meaning of 10 words, on one
hand, by retrieval practice in which words and their synonyms
were shown for 8 s, and the participants were asked to read
them aloud and then try to retrieve their synonyms. The other
10 words, on the other hand, were taught by restudy in which
the participants read the story or list of target words again and
did a puzzle book after a 2-min break. After 1 week, learners'
recall of the target words was measured. The results revealed
that words learned by retrieval practice were statistically
recalled better than words learned by restudy.
Recently, Huang and Lin (2014) introduced a new approach
to using L1 (Taiwanese) glosses. They agreed that glossing
facilitates the creation of correct form­meaning connections
but does not encourage inference or retrieval of words' mean-
ing. Thus, they investigated the effects of combining inferring
and word meaning retrieval on vocabulary learning. One hun-
dred twenty-four freshmen at the high-intermediate proficiency
level were selected from a university in Taiwan. A reading text
was created by combining multiple sources, including three
online articles and two articles from CNN English magazine,
and eight target words judged to be difficult for upper-interme-
diate students were selected; each of them appeared 3 times in
the reading text. Then, the text was revised to reflect three dif-
ferent glossing conditions (i.e., inference-gloss-gloss, gloss-
retrieval-gloss, and full glossing). Target words were either
glossed in Chinese or unglossed depending on the different
conditions. In the inference-gloss-gloss condition, the partici-
pants inferred the word meaning in the first word encounter and
were provided with glosses for the subsequent two word
encounters; in the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition, the partici-
pants were provided with glosses for the first and last word
encounters but were expected to retrieve the word meaning in
the second word encounter; and in the full glossing condition,
the participants were provided with glosses for all the word
encounters. Participants were assigned randomly in different
glossing conditions. Immediately after reading the text, they
received a reading comprehension test and an immediate
vocabulary test, and 2 weeks later, they received delayed
vocabulary posttest. Results showed that the gloss-retrieval-
gloss condition was statistically the most effective condition
for improving vocabulary learning.
Previous studies have examined the effects of textual
glossing on L2 vocabulary learning and reading comprehen-
sion. These studies have supported the effectiveness of tex-
tual glosses in facilitating L2 vocabulary learning. Moreover,
most studies have investigated the role of different factors
such as repeating target words in the text (Peters, 2014; Rott,
2007) and promoting vocabulary recall (Goossens et al.,
2014; Nowzan & Baryaji, 2013; Rott, 2007) on L2 vocabu-
lary learning; however, the role of combining such interven-
tions has been little examined so far (Huang & Lin, 2014).
The present study, therefore, aimed to fill this gap in the lit-
erature by combining inference, retrieval, and glosses
together in vocabulary learning and examining the effects of
such glossing conditions on vocabulary recall. Thus, the fol-
lowing research question was addressed:
Research Question: Do different glossing conditions
(such as those investigated here, inference-gloss-gloss,
gloss-retrieval-gloss, inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss, gloss-
retrieval-gloss-retrieval, and full glossing) have different
effects on EFL learners' vocabulary recall?
Methods
Participants
One hundred forty (98 female and 42 male) MA students of
Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) in five intact
classes were selected to participate in this study. The reason
4 SAGE Open
behind selecting MAstudents of TEFL was their accessibility.
The setting of the present study was Islamic Azad University
of Ahvaz, Khouzestan, Iran. The participants' ages ranged
from 22 to 40 (M = 30.57, SD = 4.03). The participants were
randomly assigned to one of the five glossing conditions (i.e.,
inference-gloss-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss, inference-gloss-
retrieval-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval, and full gloss-
ing) with the same number of participants (n = 28) in each
group.
Instruments
Vocabulary pretest.To ensure that the target words to be
glossed were unknown to the participants, a vocabulary pre-
test was given to them. The pretest included 20 words
selected from the reading section of Barron's TOEFL iBT
(Sharpe, 2010). The participants were required to provide the
Persian translation of the words. Finally, five words unknown
to all participants were chosen as the target words.
Reading passage and target words.The reading passage,
`Thermoregulation', was adopted from Barron's TOEFL
iBT (Sharpe, 2010; see Appendix A). Despite the reading
passage title, it did not have much technical vocabulary in
it. This passage was selected based on different criteria:
difficulty level, text length, syntactic complexity, and con-
tent. The reading passage had 784 words (including the
title), six paragraphs, at a Flesch Reading Ease of 42.6 and
Flesch­Kincaid Grade Level of 13 indicating that the pas-
sage was suitable for the university students (Zamanian &
Heydari, 2012). The passage was also given to two experi-
enced EFL professors who taught MA courses, and they
judged its difficulty appropriate for the participants. Thus,
it was assumed that the participants were comfortable with
the difficulty level of the passage. Five target words,
included three nouns and two verbs, were selected based
on the pretest's results. The five target words were terres-
trial, endotherms, blubber, insulation, and vasodilation.
The reading passage was modified in a way that each target
word appeared 3 or 4 times in the reading passage based on
the intended glossing condition. Thus, the reading passage
differed in terms of text length, target word occurrences,
and number of paragraphs in different glossing conditions.
A target word did not appear twice in the same paragraph.
Each paragraph appeared on one page to ensure that par-
ticipants could not see the target gloss during inferring or
retrieval (recall). Moreover, before moving to the next
paragraph on the next page, the participants were told to
put the previous paper on the ground and do not return to
the previous page.
Glossing conditions. Target words were boldfaced in the pas-
sage, and five different L1 (Persian) marginal gloss condi-
tions were included to investigate whether they had different
effects on L2 vocabulary recall.
In the inference-gloss-gloss condition, each target word
appeared 3 times in the passage; the participants were
expected to infer the meanings of target words (based on
their surrounding sentences) in the first word encounter in
the passage; then, target words were glossed in the second
and the third word occurrence.
In the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition, each target word
appeared 3 times in the passage; they were glossed in the first
and the third occurrence, but in the second word occurrence,
the participants were expected to recall the word's meaning
(based on the previously seen glosses in the first word
encounter).
In the inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss condition, each tar-
get word appeared 4 times in the passage; the participants
were expected to infer the word's meaning in the first occur-
rence (based on the context); then the word's meaning was
presented as a gloss in the second occurrence; in the third
word's occurrence, the participants were expected to recall
the meaning again (based on the previously seen gloss in the
second word encounter). Finally, for the last occurrence of
the words, the meaning of target words was presented as a
gloss (see Appendix B).
In the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition, each target
word appeared 4 times in the passage; they were glossed in
the first occurrence; then participants were expected to recall
the word's meaning in the second occurrence; again, glosses
were presented in the third occurrence, and the participants
were expected to recall the word's meaning in the last
occurrence.
In the full glossing condition, each target word appeared 3
times in the passage; they were glossed in all occurrences,
and so no inferencing or recalling had to be done by the
readers.
Multiple-choice reading comprehension test.Immediately fol-
lowing the reading, the participants were asked to answer a
reading comprehension test including four multiple-choice
questions. For each question, the participants were asked to
choose the best answer from the four given choices. The
questions were selected from the original reading compre-
hension test in Barron's TOEFL iBT (Sharpe, 2010).
Vocabulary posttests. The vocabulary posttests consisted of a
form recall test and a meaning recall test. In cognitive psy-
chology, recall test is a test of memory in which participants
are presented with stimuli and then, after a delay, are asked
to remember as many of the stimuli as possible (Goldstein,
2011). Following Huang and Lin's (2014) study, the form
recall test, on one hand, required the participants to translate
L1 (Persian) words into their corresponding L2 (English) tar-
get words in the passage (see Appendix C). On the other
hand, the meaning recall test required the participants to
translate the L2 (English) target words into L1 (Persian) (see
Appendix D). Each test consisted of 10 items, the five target
words and five distractors in a mixed order. There were five
Danesh and Farvardin 5
target items in form recall and five target items in meaning
recall posttest. Distractors were neglected in scoring proce-
dure. A correct answer received 1 point, and incorrect one
received no point. Answers containing minor spelling mis-
takes such as "imediatly" (instead of "immediately") were
scored as correct.
Procedures
The study was conducted during the participants' regular
class times, and it required two sessions. In the first session,
a vocabulary pretest was administered to the participants. In
the second session, the participants read a passage and then
answered a reading comprehension test and a vocabulary
posttest. Before the beginning of the study, the reading pas-
sage was modified to ensure that the participants could not
see the glosses during inferring or retrieval.Atarget word did
not appear twice in the same paragraph, and once partici-
pants moved on to the next paragraph on the next page, they
could not return to the previous one.
The different glossing conditions were predefined, and
the reading passage was modified for each of the five differ-
ent glossing conditions. The participants were randomly
assigned to one of the five glossing conditions. Each group
was asked to read one passage containing the target words
that had been adopted for the glossing conditions they were
assigned to. The participants were instructed to read for com-
prehension. After reading the passage, the participants com-
pletedthereadingcomprehensiontestandthenthevocabulary
posttest. The whole intervention session required approxi-
mately 30 min. The reading comprehension test was used to
ensure that the participants would not skim through the
passage.
Data Analysis
All scores were recorded in SPSS, Version 21. To answer the
research question, one-way MANOVA was conducted.
Results
In this section, the statistical analyses are described. The dis-
cussion of the results can be found in a following section.
Results of Descriptive Statistics
Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the five groups in
their vocabulary form and meaning recall posttests.
As shown in Table 2, the study had five groups (n = 28
each) with different glossing conditions (i.e., inference-
gloss-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss, inference-gloss-retrieval-
gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval, and full glossing). In
the form recall test, the lowest mean score belonged to
gloss-retrieval-gloss group (M = 2.57, SD = 1.133), whereas
the full glossing group obtained the highest mean score
(M = 4.21, SD = 0.995). The total mean for all conditions for
the form recall test was 3.59, and the total standard devia-
tion was 1.229. In the meaning recall test, the lowest mean
score was related to gloss-retrieval-gloss group (M = 3.57,
SD = 1.136). However, the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval
group obtained the highest mean score (M = 4.32, SD =
0.819). Total mean for the meaning recall test was 4.13, and
the total standard deviation was 0.812. The participants'
overall mean score was higher in the meaning recall test
(M = 4.13, SD = 0.812) than in the form recall test
(M = 3.59, SD = 1.229).
Results of Inferential Statistics
A one-way between-groups MANOVA was conducted to
investigate the effects of different glossing conditions on
vocabulary recall. The dependent variables were partici-
pants' scores on form and meaning recall tests. The indepen-
dent variable was glossing conditions. Table 3 shows the
results of Levene's test of equality of variances across all
groups.
As shown in Table 3, the assumption for between-groups
homogeneity of variance across different glossing conditions
in vocabulary form and meaning recall tests is met as each p
value is greater than .05. Table 4 depicts the multivariate test
of significance for the immediate posttest. This test indicates
whether there are statistically significant differences among
the gloss groups on a linear combination of vocabulary form
and meaning recall tests.

According to Table 4, there was a statistically significant
difference between glossing conditions on vocabulary recall,
F(8, 268) = 5.195, p = .000; Wilks's lambda = 0.750; partial
2 = 0.134. As probability value is less than .05, it can be
concluded that the participants' performance on vocabulary
form and meaning recall tests was significantly dependent on
glossing conditions. Table 5 displays the results of MANOVA
on different groups' performance on the form and meaning
recall tests.
Table 5 shows that for the form recall test, F(4, 135) = 9.377,
p = .000, and partial 2 = 0.217. For the meaning recall test,
F(4, 135) = 4.622, p = .002, and partial 2 = 0.120.As the prob-
ability value is less than .05, it can be concluded that results for
both vocabulary form and meaning recall immediate posttests
are significant; thus, gloss conditions had significant effect on
vocabulary recall. Scheffé post hoc tests were used to find
where the specific differences were located. Table 6 presents
the results of Scheffé post hoc tests on vocabulary tests across
gloss conditions.
As Table 6 shows, for the form recall test, the inference-
gloss-gloss group outperformed the gloss-retrieval-gloss
group (MD = 0.96, p = .035). Moreover, the inference-gloss-
retrieval-gloss group did better than the gloss-retrieval-gloss
group (MD = -1.04, p = .018). The gloss-retrieval-gloss-
retrieval group surpassed the gloss-retrieval-gloss group (MD
= -1.46, p = .000).Also, the full glossing group outperformed
the gloss-retrieval-gloss group (MD = -1.64, p = .000). As
depicted in Table 5, for the meaning recall test, the inference-
gloss-retrieval-gloss group did better than the gloss-retrieval-
gloss group (MD = -0.71, p = .021). Moreover, the
gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval group surpassed the gloss-
retrieval-gloss group (MD = -0.75, p = .013). Also, the full
glossing group outperformed the gloss-retrieval-gloss group
(MD = -0.68, p = .033).
Discussion
Form Recall Test
The results of the study revealed that all gloss conditions
yielded different vocabulary recall scores. According to the
results of the form recall test, of the five interventions, the
full glossing condition most benefited vocabulary learning,
followed by gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval, inference-gloss-
retrieval-gloss, inference-gloss-gloss, and gloss-retrieval-
gloss conditions. In addition, the difference between full
glossing and gloss-retrieval-gloss conditions was significant
(Table 6).
The results obtained for the full glossing condition contra-
dict Huang and Lin's (2014) contention that repeated encoun-
ters with glosses may not necessarily lead to learners' active
processing of glosses in the margin; their study revealed that
the full glossing condition generated the least vocabulary
learning in comparison with the other glossing conditions
(gloss-retrieval-gloss and inference-gloss-gloss conditions).
In this study, the full glossing condition outperformed the
other four glossing conditions on the vocabulary form recall
test. This confirms Rott's (2007) claim that repeated encoun-
ters with glosses could offer learners repeated opportunities
to isolate the glossed word from its surrounding context to
rehearse the word meanings in their working memory.
The results also showed that the gloss-retrieval-gloss-
retrieval condition was the second best glossing arrangement
for a word that occurred in the passage according to the
vocabulary form recall test. These findings support the claim

that retrieval can play a positive role in enhancing vocabu-
lary learning (Goossens et al., 2014). Moreover, the gloss-
retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition's significant mean
difference with the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition in the
form recall test would be related to additional reviewing of
the target items (Rott, 2007).
The inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss condition served as
the third most beneficial glossing condition on the vocabu-
lary form recall test. The results of this study confirm Rott's
(2007) claim that repeated visual enhancement itself seems
to have no effect on extending word processing and vocabu-
lary learning. Participants might ignore the first contextual
clues provided in the first condition in the inference-gloss-
retrieval-gloss condition, as they did not have any back-
ground knowledge about the topic of the reading text or even
about the test's goal which was vocabulary learning (Zaid,
2009). On the other hand, the inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss
condition significantly outperformed the gloss-retrieval-
gloss condition. This could be attributed to the participants'
increased attention because of increased target word occur-
rence and providing a bolded form for the target words.
As for the form recall test, the inference-gloss-gloss condi-
tion was the fourth best intervention condition in this study. It
generated less word learning than the full glossing condition.
The lower vocabulary recall in the inference-gloss-gloss con-
dition than in the full glossing condition could be linked to
Zaid's (2009) assumption that presenting target words with
contextual clues should help with inferencing meanings of
new items, but it depends heavily on the background knowl-
edge. Thus, it may not lead to successful meaning guessing,
whereas providing the correct word meaning in accordance
with context would result in more vocabulary gain.
Vocabulary learning through the inference-gloss-gloss
and gloss-retrieval-gloss conditions significantly differed
from each other, and the inference-gloss-gloss condition had
a higher mean than the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition. This
may relate to the additional contextual clues accompanying
inference situation in the inference-gloss-gloss condition,
which gave the readers the opportunity to check their
assumed meaning with the contextual clues.
Of the five interventions, the gloss-retrieval-gloss condi-
tion generated the least vocabulary learning in both form
recall and meaning recall tests. It was significantly inferior to
full glossing condition on the form recall test. Contrary to
Huang and Lin's (2014) study where the participants had a
better performance on the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition
than on the full glossing condition, the participants in this
study focused more on glossed words than unglossed ones
and relied on the accessible input for vocabulary learning
than activating the act of retrieval in the memory.
Meaning Recall Test
Concerning the meaning recall test, of the five interventions,
the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition most benefited
vocabulary learning, followed by inference-gloss-retrieval-

gloss, full glossing, inference-gloss-gloss, and gloss-
retrieval-gloss conditions (Table 6).
The gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition was the most
influential intervention for vocabulary meaning recall. This
finding supports the claim that retrieval can fix items in the
memory, improve the memory traces, and increase the accessi-
bility of information in the memory (Nowzan & Baryaji, 2013).
Moreover, it implies that retrieval can strengthen the link
between form and meaning and hence enhance the recall of the
words'meaning (Rott, 2007). The involvement load of retrieval
is assumed to be three because it triggers the need to understand
a word, search for its meaning in the mental lexicon, and evalu-
ation of whether the searched meaning is contextually correct
(Rott, 2007). In addition, the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval con-
dition's significant mean difference with the gloss-retrieval-
gloss condition in the meaning recall test would be related to the
additional word encounter's role in activating word processing
in the mind.
The inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss condition performed
as the second most beneficial glossing condition on the
meaning recall test. It was not significantly different from
the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition (the best inter-
vention condition on this test), but the existing difference
would be related to the presentation of the target word's
meaning in the first encounter in the gloss-retrieval-gloss
condition, which would increase the reader's attention to the
target word in following word encounters and thus result to
more vocabulary gain (Rott, 2007). The inference-gloss-
retrieval-gloss condition's statistically significant superior-
ity over the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition could arise from
more repeated opportunities for target word processing as
suggested in Peters (2014).
The full glossing condition served as the third most
beneficial gloss type based on meaning recall test scores;
it outperformed inference-gloss-gloss and gloss-retrieval-
gloss conditions in the vocabulary meaning recall test. As
for the meaning recall test, the inference-gloss-gloss con-
dition was also the fourth best intervention condition
found in the study. The best glossing condition on mean-
ing recall test was the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval con-
dition, but it was not statistically better than the
inference-gloss-gloss condition. One possible reason may
be due to the increased frequency of the target words in
the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition compared
with the inference-gloss-gloss condition (Peters, 2014).
On this meaning recall test, the gloss-retrieval-gloss-
retrieval condition showed the highest vocabulary learn-
ing results, and it significantly outperformed the
gloss-retrieval-gloss condition. According to Barcroft
(2015), providing opportunities for target word retrieval
can positively affect incidental L2 vocabulary learning,
one additional recall chance in the gloss-retrieval-gloss-
retrieval condition would be the reason of gloss-retrieval-
gloss-retrieval group's outperformance.
Conclusion
Few studies on L2 learning have examined textual glosses
in combination with meaning inferencing and retrieval as
glossing condition models. This study focused on this
issue by comparing five glossing conditions in their effects
on L2 vocabulary recall. The results of the study suggested
that full glossing was the best intervention condition for
vocabulary form recall, and it was more effective than the
other four conditions in promoting L2 vocabulary learning.
The gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition was the best
intervention condition for vocabulary meaning recall, and
it was more effective than inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss,
full glossing, inference-gloss-gloss, and gloss-retrieval-
gloss conditions in promoting recalling the target words'
meaning. This study provides much-needed information
on the effects of different glossing conditions on L2 vocab-
ulary learning. By comparing five glossing conditions
together, it sheds light on the use of different glossing con-
ditions for L2 vocabulary learning.
The findings of the present study are subject to a num-
ber of limitations. The participants were MA students of
TEFL, selected from a university where all instruction is
done in English; accordingly, it is uncertain whether the
findings can be readily applied to other students at a differ-
ent educational level with different levels of language
knowledge/proficiency. The difficulty of inferring each
target word in the study might be different, so presenting
these words in different contexts or conducting the research
on different target words might generate different results.
As only five target words were included in the passage,
choosing a text with different lexical coverage may pro-
duce different results.
Future studies could be carried out to explore the effects
of these glossing conditions on the non-English major stu-
dents at the tertiary level. Moreover, this study only investi-
gated words that occurred 3 or 4 times in the text; other
studies could investigate words that occur less or more than
3 or 4 times to determine whether other glossing conditions
can lead to more vocabulary learning.
Appendix A
The Original Reading Passage
Thermoregulation. Mammals and birds generally maintain
body temperature within a narrow range (36 °C-38 °C for
most birds) that is usually considerably warmer than the
environment. Because heat always flows from a warm
object to cooler surroundings, birds and mammals must
counteract the constant heat loss. This maintenance of
warm body temperature depends on several key adapta-
tions. The most basic mechanism is the high metabolic
rate of endothermy itself. Endotherms can produce large
amounts of metabolic heat that replace the flow of heat to
Danesh and Farvardin 9
the environment, and they can vary heat production to
much changing rates of heat loss. Heat production is
increased by such muscles activity as moving or shiver-
ing. In some mammals, certain hormones can cause
mitochondria to increase their metabolic activity and
produce heat instead of ATP (energy that drives certain
reactions in cells). This nonshivering thermogenesis
(NST) takes place throughout the body, but some mam-
mals also have a tissue called brown fat in the neck and
between the shoulders that is specialized for rapid heat
production. Through shivering and NST, mammals and
birds in cold environments can increase their metabolic
heat production by as much as 5 to 10 times above the
minimal levels those occur in warm conditions.
Another major thermoregulatory adaptation that
evolved in mammals and birds is insulation (hair, feath-
ers, and fat layers that prevent transfer of heat), which
reduces the flow of heat and lowers the energy cost of
keeping warm. Most land mammals and birds react to
cold by raising their fur or feathers, thereby trapping a
thicker layer of air. Humans rely more on a layer of fat
just beneath the skin; goose bumps are a vestige of hair-
raising left over from our furry ancestors. Vasodilation
and vasoconstriction also regulate heat exchange and
may contribute to regional temperature differences within
the animal. For example, heat loss from a human is
reduced when arms and legs cool to several degrees
below the temperature of body core, where most vital
organs are located.
Hair loses most of its insulation power when wet.
Marine mammals such as whales and seals have a very
thick layer of fat called blubber just under the skin.
These mammals swim in water colder than their body
core temperature, and many species spend at least part of
the year in nearly freezing polar seas. The loss of heat to
water occurs 50 to 100 times more rapidly than heat loss
to air, and the skin temperature of a marine mammal is
close to water temperature. Even so, the blubber insula-
tion is so effective that marine mammals maintain body
core temperatures of about 36 °C to 38 °C with meta-
bolic rates about the same as those of land mammals of
similar size. The flippers or tail of a whale or seal lack
blubber, but countercurrent heat exchangers greatly
reduce heat loss in these extremities, as they do in the
legs of many birds.
Through metabolic heat production, insulation, and vas-
cular adjustments, birds and mammals are capable of aston-
ishing feats of thermoregulation. For example, small birds
called chickadees, which weigh only 20 g, can remain active
and hold body temperature nearly constant at 40 °C in envi-
ronmental temperatures as low as -40 °C--as long as they
have enough food to supply the large amount of energy nec-
essary for heat production.
Many mammals and birds live in places where thermo-
regulation requires cooling off as well as warming. For
example, when a marine mammal moves into warm seas, as
many whales do when they reproduce, excess metabolic
heat is removed by vasodilation of numerous blood vessels
in the outer layer of the skin. In hot climates or when vigor-
ous exercise adds large amounts of metabolic heat in the
body, many terrestrial mammals and birds may allow body
temperature to rise by several degrees, which enhances heat
loss by increasing the temperature gradient between the
body and a warm environment.
Evaporative cooling often plays a key role in dissipat-
ing the body heat. If environmental temperature is above
body temperature, animals gain heat from the environ-
ment as well as from metabolism, and evaporation is the
only way to keep body temperature from rising rapidly.
Panting is important in birds and many mammals. Some
birds have a pouch richly supplied with blood vessels in
the floor of the mouth; fluttering the pouch increases
evaporation. Pigeons can use evaporative cooling to keep
body temperature close to 40 °C in air temperature as high
as 60 °C, as long as they have sufficient water. Many ter-
restrial mammals have sweat glands controlled by the ner-
vous system. Other mechanisms that promote evaporative
cooling include spreading saliva on body surfaces, an
adaptation of some kangaroos and rodents for combating
severe heat stress. Some bats use both saliva and urine to
enhance evaporative cooling.
