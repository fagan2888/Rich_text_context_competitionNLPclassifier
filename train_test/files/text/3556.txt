Introduction:The Forms of
Intercultural Capital
Cultural capital, as Bourdieu (1986b) influentially argued,
can be conceived in terms of three characteristic forms: in
the objectified state--such as in writings, paintings, sculp-
tures, musical compositions, tools, or machinery; in the
institutionalized state--typically in the shape of official
certifications provided by schools, colleges, and universi-
ties; and in the embodied state--as people's personal reser-
voir of cultural knowledge and know-how. Although not
always explicit in Bourdieu's work, the respective forms of
cultural capital only exist in relation to and through (differ-
ent) cultures--here understood as pervious, evolving, more
or less consciously learned, and more or less closely
"shared" frames of perception, thought, and (inter)action
that are both shaped by and shape their (histories of) objec-
tification and institutionalization.
While it might be true that certain expressions of cultural
learnedness--familiarity with "classic" music and literature,
for example--constitute today less pertinent sources of
sociocultural distinction than at the time when Bourdieu ana-
lyzed fields of struggle over (symbolic) power, little points at
a more general decline in the (inter)personal and societal rel-
evance of cultural capital. Quite to the contrary, in fact,
countless research endeavors across cultural and disciplinary
boundaries provide compelling evidence of the enduring
explanatory value of "cultural capital variables".1
In an ever more interdependent world, intercultural capi-
tal emerges as an increasingly significant type of cultural
capital and marker of sociocultural distinction. Its manifesta-
tions at the level of objectification include monuments with
important intercultural connotations such as The Mother of
Humanity® sculpture in Los Angeles (USA), the Way of
Human Rights in Nuremberg (Germany), and the Monument
to Multiculturalism in Toronto (Canada); international agree-
ments or declarations with inherent intercultural dimensions
such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; com-
memorative days such as the International Day for the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination on March 21, World
Peace Day on September 21, or Human Rights Day on
December 10th that are acknowledged across cultural bound-
aries around the globe; institutions and organizations with a
strong intercultural underpinning (e.g., bi- or multilingual
schools, intercultural universities, the European Court of
Human Rights, or the United Nations); as well as books,
articles, pamphlets, reports, speeches, and other academic or
nonacademic publications with an intercultural outlook.

Intercultural Capital:Toward the
Conceptualization, Operationalization, and
Empirical Investigation of a Rising Marker of
Sociocultural Distinction
Andreas Pöllmann1
Abstract
Drawing from Pierre Bourdieu's conceptual "toolbox", this article focuses on intercultural capital as an increasingly significant
type of cultural capital and marker of sociocultural distinction. It first introduces different forms of intercultural capital, with
a particular interest in the potential benefits of its embodiment. Subsequently, the critical question as to why some people
can be considered as better positioned to realize intercultural capital than others is being addressed.The remainder of the
discussion looks at possible operational "measures" for the concept of intercultural capital and how these may be applied to
examine the conditions and potential impact of its realization.

With official endorsement, such objectified forms of
intercultural capital can gain legitimacy and become more
readily recognized across cultural boundaries. For instance,
when Nuremberg received the UNESCO Prize for Human
Rights Education, the aforementioned Way of Human Rights
was internationally acknowledged as an important part of the
city's accomplishments--and thus decorated with a form of
institutionalized intercultural capital. In a similar vein, insti-
tutions of formal education can enhance "ordinary" individ-
ual-level manifestations of embodied intercultural capital
(e.g., language skills, intercultural friendships, or experi-
ences of living abroad) through authoritative and lasting offi-
cial testimonies and certifications.
Even if the inter in intercultural capital emphasizes the
sphere of relationships and relationalities between (different)
cultures, it deliberately does so without neglecting "cultural
particularities". In fact, all forms of intercultural capital are
also forms of cultural capital in that they are particular to the
cultures in relation to and through which they have emerged.
And all forms of cultural capital are also forms of intercul-
tural capital given that the cultures in relation to and through
which they have emerged constitute, to a greater or lesser
extent, a product of intercultural contact and "mixing".
What distinguishes cultural and intercultural forms of
capital is their relative degree of field-transcendence. For
Bourdieu, capital, in its various forms, constitutes "an energy
which only exists and only produces its effects in the field in
which it is produced and reproduced" (Bourdieu, 1984, p.
113) and, consequently, tends to lose force with increasing
distance from the field(s) of its (re)production. Intercultural
capital, to the contrary, functions as a potent marker of socio-
cultural distinction within a wider range of contexts of (re)
production and is likely to retain, or indeed enhance, its
exchange value when "moved" across more distant fields.
The focus of the present article lies on intercultural capi-
tal in the embodied state, which may, at first glance, appear
as yet another linguistic variant of similar and already well-
established terminologies such as intercultural competence,
intercultural communication skills, or intercultural sensitiv-
ity. In fact, the notion of embodied intercultural capital--to
which, for the remainder of this article, I will simply refer to
as intercultural capital--expressly entails intercultural
skills, competencies, and sensitivities. However, inspired by
Bourdieu's work, it does not solely relate to intercultural
proficiencies as such,2 but also to their relative exchange
value and the circumstances under which they are more or
less likely to be realized.
The subsequent discussion first looks at the notion of
"intercultural capital realization", with a view on the benefits
that it may bring about. It then moves on to illustrate why
some people can be considered as better positioned to realize
intercultural capital than others. The article proceeds with a
focus on potential operational "measures" and promising
areas of application in empirical research, before revisiting
some important points by way of conclusion.
The Realization of Intercultural
Capital and Its Potential Benefits
Intercultural capital can be realized in terms of (a combina-
tion of) awareness, acquisition, and application, as outlined
in Table 1.
While the full realization of intercultural capital involves
a certain degree of awareness of what may be at stake, the
lack of it does not necessarily preclude effective acquisitions
and applications, particularly in cases where people's socio-
cultural environment favors habitual and largely taken-for-
granted processes of capital embodiment.
The kinds of sociocultural environment in which intercul-
tural capital may be acquired en passant, so to speak, can
range from poorly financed state community centers in cul-
turally diverse working class neighborhoods to lavish inter-
national management training programs for "global business
leaders". Even if the former source of intercultural capital
acquisition is as such (i.e., in ontological terms) no less
"valuable" than the latter, it is unlikely to be as highly prized,
widely recognized, and easily convertible (i.e., into eco-
nomic capital).
Because intercultural capital (as all cultural capital) tends
to operate "as symbolic capital, i.e., to be unrecognized as
capital" (Bourdieu, 1986b, p. 245), it can involve substantial
financial profits even (or particularly) when these are not
directly evident. But intercultural capital--when embodied
in form of a more or less consciously learned and habituated
intercultural know-how--as a practical intercultural sense,
can offer more than a set of economically viable skills that
allow their respective bearers to successfully compete in
global markets. It can complement "original" cultural per-
spectives without imposing a need to abandon them in favor
of assimilation to "new" ones. And by doing so, it may lead
people to appreciate cultural diversity and develop an under-
standing for previously unfamiliar and perhaps "strange"
situations and contexts.
As a solid body of research in the area of intergroup con-
tact theory suggests, the kinds of personal encounter with
extraordinary and previously unfamiliar customs, environ-
ments, people, or languages, which lie at the heart of the
realization of intercultural capital, can render significant

(inter)personal and societal benefits (Crystal, Killen, &
Ruck, 2008; Davies, Tropp, Aron, Pettigrew, & Wright,
2011; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006; Pettigrew, Tropp, Wagner, &
Christ, 2011). Ever since Allport's (1954) original qualifica-
tions, it is, however, also evident that intergroup contact in
and by itself does not always and necessarily occur in, or
lead to, harmonious intergroup relations where all (members
of) different groups enjoy equal status and (symbolic) power
(Barlow et al., 2012; Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002;
Maoz, 2000; Saguy, Dovidio, & Pratto, 2008).
Ultimately, the fact that, throughout human history,
intercultural encounters have often been characterized by
fierce conflict, war, and destruction rather than benevo-
lence, consensus, and peace (Demorgon, 2005) reminds us
of the importance of subjecting any presumed benefits of
realizing intercultural capital to thorough empirical scru-
tiny. Before attending to issues of operationalization and
empirical application, let us take a look at a number of
interrelated factors that are likely to influence people's
chances of realizing intercultural capital and the benefits
that it may bring about.
Who Is in a Position to Realize
Intercultural Capital?
The realization of (inter)cultural capital is inherently "linked
to the biological individual" (Bourdieu, 2000, p. 157).
Indeed, it always takes effect through somebody's biologi-
cally mediated (history of) individual practice--including
deliberate reflections as well as less conscious and often
taken-for-granted "manners of being, seeing, acting and
thinking" (Bourdieu, 2005, p. 43) or habitus. However, the
likely extent of individual capital realization cannot be
meaningfully evaluated based on the analysis of individual
characteristics (e.g., age and gender) and practice alone, but
is better thought of as the product of interrelated individual
and environmental factors, as indicated in Figure 1.
People's family background and upbringing no doubt
play a crucial part in the course of their educational forma-
tion and throughout life (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1977, 1979).
Those who can draw on a domestic inheritance of highly val-
ued and widely convertible economic, social, and (inter)cul-
tural capital will be more likely to accumulate highly prized
and widely transferable varieties of intercultural capital, and
take advantage of their accumulation, than others who do not
enjoy such privileges (Pöllmann, 2009). But even in cases
where a supportive and well-positioned family network pro-
vides access to "a share in the sum of the assets of all its
members" (Bourdieu, 1996, p. 292), the efficacy of people's
personal intercultural capital can still vary significantly--
largely depending on their actual or perceived affiliation
with ethnic, linguistic, national, racial, religious, or other
groups--and particularly in a climate of group-specific dom-
ination and marginalization.
More than three decades ago, Hall (1976) pointed out that
"the many gifts and talents of women, blacks, Native
Americans, Spanish-Americans and others are not only unrec-
ognized, but frequently denigrated by members of the domi-
nant group" (p. 7). Today as in the 1970s, in the United States
of America and elsewhere, group-specific "hierarchies" can
have a detrimental impact on people's opportunities in life, not
only in circumstances of blatant exclusionism and discrimina-
tion (e.g., during the South African Apartheid regime), but
also through more concealed forms of exclusion and disad-
vantage due to a lack of recognition of group-specific rights
within "egalitarian societies" (Fraser, 1995; Kymlicka, 1995;
Modood, 2007; Parekh, 2006; Young, 2011).
Essentially, members of marginalized groups can pursue
three courses of action to enhance their chances of realizing
intercultural capital: they can undertake to change their
group affiliations; they can join into struggles over the rec-
ognition and appreciation of their particular (inter)cultural
experiences and skills; or they can endeavor to challenge and
change the often taken-for-granted practices and (unspoken)

rules that are sustained by and sustain established sociocul-
tural divisions of (symbolic) power.
To be sure, as much as groups can be empowering,
diverse, and open to change, they can be constraining, total-
izing, and inflexible. But they hardly ever make up entirely
homogeneous and fully unified wholes in which individual
members amalgamate into a mysterious collective (Benhabib,
2004; Erel, 2010; Kymlicka, 2007; Parekh, 2008; Phillips,
2009). More often than not, different people will have differ-
ent ideas about the meanings and purpose of the groups to
which they (are perceived to) belong. They may feel strongly
attached to some groups, while hardly taking notice of
"objectively" existing links to others. They may dissociate
themselves from previous group affiliations and, possibly,
develop a desire to engage in new ones.
Group membership is, however, not in all instances, and
not only, a matter of personal choice. If it was, it would
indeed be fairly easy for people to change their respective
affiliations and thus their relative chances of realizing inter-
cultural capital. In fact, however, external evaluations of an
individual's (alleged) group membership(s) can persist even
if they are at odds with his or her actual personal situation
and choices. For those concerned, such a lack of "evaluative
congruence" constitutes no trivial matter. As much as posi-
tive external evaluations can encourage and facilitate, nega-
tive stereotypes and prejudice can discourage and
immobilize--particularly if they become internalized with
effects on people's self-perception and self-esteem (Taylor,
1994).
As it happens, people often choose to assert rather than
to change their affiliations with different groups. Instead
of renouncing group membership in the face of discrimina-
tion and marginalization, they see it as an important source
of identity, pride, solidarity, and mutual empowerment.
After all,
Social, economic and political equality are not pro-
vided on a platter. They have to be fought for and,
what is just as difficult, sustained. This calls for a
positive identity among the inferiorized groups, and
hence a cultural struggle both within the groups and in
the wider society. (Parekh, 2008, p. 50)
For (members of) inferiorized groups, a vital part of this
struggle consists in affirming that it is much less a shortage
of domestic and cultural resources that accounts for their
marginalization, but the lack of sociocultural recognition and
appreciation of these resources as legitimate and valuable--
a point forcefully developed in various critiques of group-
specific stereotyping and "deficit thinking" within the field
of formal education (Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez, 1992;
Valencia, 2010; Yosso, 2005).
The prospects of individual or collective demands for the
recognition and appreciation of a wider range of (hitherto
marginalized) varieties of domestic and cultural resources
will vary from context to context, and particularly
across different states. As the holders "of the monopoly of
legitimate symbolic violence" (Bourdieu, 1991b, p. 239, ital-
ics in original), states represent a prime force in the shaping
of sociocultural categorizations and divisions, be it explicitly
and formally by authorizing legal provisions and laws
(Bourdieu, 1986a), or less overtly, but often no less effec-
tively, within other fields of struggle over (symbolic)
power--including the realms of formal education (Bourdieu
& Passeron, 1977), cultural production (Bourdieu, 1993),
language and communication (Bourdieu, 1991b), religion
(Bourdieu, 1991a), and gender (Bourdieu, 2001).
Whenever the (symbolic) "power to impose the legitimate
vision of the social world . . . its present meaning and the
direction in which it is going and should go" (Bourdieu,
2000, p. 185) is asymmetrically distributed, some individu-
als and groups will have more opportunities to accumulate
intercultural capital than others. And even if they realize
only comparatively little intercultural capital in terms of
awareness and acquisition, its relative currency value--that
is its realizability in terms of application--would still be
likely to exceed that of others, whose personal stock of inter-
cultural capital may be nominally larger, but is being greatly
devalued by their unfavorable sociocultural positioning.
We will return to questions of realization and realizability
in the concluding section. First, however, let us consider
some ideas as to how possible operationalizations of the con-
cept of intercultural capital may look like and across which
types of research the respective empirical indicators might
be applied. After all, theoretical concepts and propositions
"are designed to be put to work empirically in systematic
fashion" (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992, p. 96, italics in origi-
nal) rather than to be treated as ends in themselves.3
Operational "Measures" and Areas
of Application in Empirical Research
A recent survey on (supra)national forms of attachment
among school leaders in Berlin and London (Pöllmann,
2008, 2010) illustrates that intercultural capital--operation-
alized as a combination of the number of spoken foreign
languages ("none", "one", or "two or more"), intercultural
friendships ("none at all", "a few", or "several"), and expe
rience of living abroad ("none", "less than 1 year", "1 to 4
years", or "5 years or longer")--can have a significant
explanatory impact.4 The scope of these indicators could,
no doubt, be further developed--particularly in terms of
their analytic depth. For instance, in addition to considering
whether and how long people say they have been living
abroad, it would be interesting to also look at both the spe-
cific type of living experience (e.g., during holidays, in the
course of an international student exchange program, or as
the result of an international work placement) and the pos-
sible learning outcomes (e.g., indicated by the level of
knowledge about another country before and after living
abroad). In a similar vein, instead of merely focusing on the
number of intercultural friends, one may dig deeper to learn
Pöllmann 5
more about the sociocultural backgrounds of the respective
friends and the subjectively perceived quality of their
friendship.
Other possible operationalizations could take account of
the different states of realization (i.e., Table 1); the degree of
field-transcendence; the length of acquisition, which
Bourdieu (1986b) conceived as "the least inexact of all the
measurements of cultural capital" (p. 244); and the mode of
acquisition, considering direct personal experiences (e.g.,
through intercultural marriage or international migration) as
well as more indirect forms of intercultural learning (e.g., via
books, television, or the Internet)--bearing in mind that
"mediate, knowing acquisition will always differ from an
immediate familiarity with the native culture" (Bourdieu,
1967, p. 358).
In the end, the number and complexity of operational
"measures" for the concept of intercultural capital will vary
depending on the specific subject under consideration and
the respective theories and methods employed in the course
of its investigation. A comparative cross-national survey
project on people's intercultural experiences and skills, for
example, is unlikely to involve the same set of empirical
indicators as an in-depth ethnographic study of intercultural
encounters within a particular local community. Apart from
its practical necessity, such flexibility at the level of opera-
tionalization prevents from limiting the notion of intercul-
tural capital to a singular (essentialized) set of connotations
and, by doing so, allows it to appeal across cultural and dis-
ciplinary boundaries.
The concept of intercultural capital lends itself to various
promising empirical applications--both as an explanatory
factor and as a phenomenon to be explained. When consid-
ered as an explanatory factor, its potential impact could be
examined in relation to a range of contemporary social prob-
lems, such as ethnocentrism, racism, religious intolerance,
and xenophobia. When treated as a phenomenon to be
explained, its relative degree of realization in terms of aware-
ness, acquisition, and application (i.e., Table 1) could be
taken into account and examined as a function of any one or
a combination of the factors outlined in Figure 1.
In quantitative social research, empirical "measures" of
intercultural capital could serve as predictors of educational
success (Nuñez, 2009), transnational employability, or atti-
tudes toward cultural diversity, foreigners, ethnic minorities,
and immigrants--to name only a few possible examples. At
present, however, the necessary large-scale survey data are
relatively scarce. The regular incorporation of "intercultural
capital variables" in cross-national survey programs such as
the European Social Survey, the World Values Survey, or the
International Social Survey Programme would largely
enhance the analytical scope of quantitative social research,
including possibilities for multilevel data analyses and sys-
tematic comparisons over time.
While statistical analyses of social survey data are par-
ticularly well suited to examine the relative explanatory
value of "intercultural capital variables", more interpretive
social research strategies (e.g., life history interviews, par-
ticipatory observation, or focus group interviews) allow for
further and more in-depth insights--not only into how the
embodiment of intercultural capital may affect people's
lives, but also on factors that may enable or constrain its real-
ization (i.e., Figure 1) in terms of awareness, acquisition, and
application (i.e., Table 1).
Whether treated as an explanatory factor or as a phenom-
enon to be explained, the notion of intercultural capital is
neither exclusively suited to qualitative applications nor
solely reserved to be used in the context of quantitative anal-
yses. Indeed, to apply the concept across cultural and disci-
plinary boundaries, and to take full advantage of its heuristic
potential, requires problem-oriented research strategies
rather than rigid theoretical frameworks and methodological
fetishisms.
Having introduced the forms of intercultural capital,
emphasized the particular significance of embodied intercul-
tural capital--its potential benefits, as well as factors that
may enable or constrain its realization--and discussed pos-
sible applications at the level of empirical research, I would
like to conclude this article with a brief outlook on some
earlier points.
Conclusion
The realization of intercultural capital can, no doubt, help
people of various backgrounds to develop a practical inter-
cultural sense for the globally interconnected world which
they inhabit--and by doing so pave the way for considerable
(inter)personal and societal benefits. In many places around
the world, however, the most highly esteemed, institution-
ally certified, and (thus) most widely convertible types of
intercultural capital are being realized by the few rather than
the many. Even within the comparatively prosperous and
enabling context of the European Union, the kind of inter-
culturally mobile lifestyles, which can be expected to facili-
tate the realization of intercultural capital, are
overproportionately associated with higher levels of socio-
economic status and majority ethno-racial backgrounds
(Fligstein, 2008; Haller, 2008; Reay, David, & Ball, 2005).
Taking into consideration that those who have already real-
ized comparatively high levels of highly valued and widely
convertible (officially recognized) intercultural capital are
likely to realize even more of it with more ease, such sys-
tematic inequalities may well exacerbate rather than dimin-
ish over time.
As we have seen, whether and how easily intercultural
capital can be realized is neither simply a question of luck or
good fortune, nor primarily the result of differences in indi-
vidual characteristics and efforts. It depends to an important
extent on a range of environmental factors. The more, for
instance, domestic capital resources, group memberships,
and the respective field conditions favor a habitual, effort-
less, and largely taken-for-granted embodiment of highly
prized and widely convertible intercultural capital, the more
6 SAGE Open
awareness is relatively dispensable. In comparatively less
favorable circumstances, on the contrary, conscious individ-
ual or collective struggles for recognition, appreciation, and
a more equal distribution of (symbolic) power become all the
more important.
As long as large parts of the world remain ridden with
profound sociocultural inequalities, it would be naïve, or at
least premature, to mistake processes of intercultural capital
realization and their possible (inter)personal and societal
benefits for the dawn of a new age of "intercultural person
hood". Instead, to avoid undue generalizations and rushed
conclusions, both the conditions and potential impact of
intercultural capital embodiment are best conceived in terms
of degree and probability, where different people can be con-
sidered as more or less likely to (be able to) possess so and
so much intercultural capital, of this or that empirical variety,
at different points of realization, and of more or less widely
transferable (institutionally certified) currency value.

do exist ­ for example within the area of critical intercultural
communication studies (e.g., Halualani & Nakayama, 2010).
3. Contrary to the false impression created by some critics (e.g.,
Goldthorpe, 2007), Bourdieu conceived (his) concepts not as
absolute, rigid, and purely theoretical frames of reference, but
as analytical "tools" that, when applied in empirical research,
quite naturally need to be adapted to do justice to the particular
problem(s) under consideration (e.g., Bourdieu, 1988, 1999;
Lamaison & Bourdieu, 1986; Wacquant, 1989).

els of intercultural capital are associated with lower levels of
national attachment and with higher levels of attachment to
Europe.
