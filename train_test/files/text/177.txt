The Performance of Endarterectomy for Disease of the
Extracranial Arteries of the Head
MARK L. DYKEN, M.D.,* AND ROBERT POKRASI
SUMMARY Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey, the Veterans Administration Hospitals
and Armed Forces Hospitals were reviewed to estimate the number of endarterectomies of extracranial
vessels of head and neck performed in the United States. The number increased from around 15,000 in 1971
to around 85,000 in 1982. An estimated 2.8% of those operated in non-federal hospitals were discharged
dead.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW the number of endar-
terectomies performed for disease of the extracranial
arteries supplying the brain, to realistically assess the
significance of the controversy concerning the indica-
tions for the procedure. For this communication, data
from the National Hospital Discharge Survey, the Vet-
erans Administration hospitals and the Departments of
Army, Air Force and Navy were reviewed and the
number of procedures were estimated for each year
from 1971 through 1982. Some remarks will be made
on the possible implications of the steady increase
from 15,000 endarterectomies in 1971 to more than
85,000 in 1982.
Methods
Several sources of data were used in an attempt to
get an estimate of the total number of endarterectomies
of extracranial vessels of head and neck performed in
the United States. The National Hospital Discharge
Survey was used to estimate those patients operated on
in short-stay hospitals, exclusive of military and Veter-
ans Administration hospitals, located in the fifty states
and the District of Columbia. Estimates of procedures
done in the Veterans Administration hospitals were
obtained from their Biometrics Division,1 in Army
hospitals from their Patient Administration Division,2
of Air Force hospitals from the Biometrics Division,3
and of Navy hospitals from the Naval Medical Data
Services.4 Except for the Veterans Administration hos-
pitals, deaths were based on the status at discharge.
For the Veterans Administration hospitals, all deaths
occurring within 30 days of the procedure were includ-

National Hospital Discharge Survey
The National Hospital Discharge Survey is a survey
of patients discharged from short-stay hospitals, exclu-
sive of military and Veterans Administration hospitals,
located in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Short-stay hospitals are defined as having six beds or
more and an average length of stay less than 30 days.
The universe of the survey consists of 6,965 short-stay
hospitals contained in the 1963 Master Facility Inven-
tory of Hospitals and Institutions. New hospitals were
sampled for inclusion in the survey in 1972, 1975,
1977, and 1979. For example, in the 1980 survey 420
of these hospitals were sampled providing approxi-
mately 224,000 abstracts of medical records. All hos-
pitals with 1,000 beds or more in the universe of short-
stay hospitals were selected with certainty. All
hospitals with fewer than 1,000 were stratified, the
primary strata being 24 size by region classes. Within
each of these 24 primary strata, the allocation of the
hospitals was made through a controlled selected tech-
nique so that hospitals in the sample would be properly
distributed with regard to type of ownership and geo-
graphic division. Sample hospitals were drawn with
probabilities ranging from certainty for the largest hos-
pitals to 1 in 40 for the smallest hospitals.
Subsamples of discharges were selected within the
sample hospitals using the daily listing sheet of dis-
charges as a sampling frame. These discharges were
selected by random technique, usually on the basis of
the terminal digit(s) of the patient's medical record
number, a number assigned when the patient was ad-
mitted to the hospital. The within hospital sampling
ratio for selected sample discharges varied inversely
with the probability of selection of the hospitals.
Statistics produced by the National Hospital Dis-
charge Survey are derived by a complex estimating
procedure. The basic unit of estimation is the sample
inpatient discharge abstract. The estimating procedure
used to produce essentially unbiased national estimates
in the National Hospital Discharge Survey has three

principle components: inflation by reciprocals of the
probabilities of sample selection, adjustment for non-
response, and a ratio adjustment to fixed totals. These
components of estimation are described in Appendix I
of two earlier publications.3-6
Because the estimates from this survey are based on
a sample rather than the entire universe, they were
subject to sampling variability. The standard error is
primarily a measure of the variability that is attributed
to using a value obtained from a sample as an estimate
of a population value. The relative standard error is
obtained by dividing the standard error by the estimate.
The resulting value is multiplied by 100 which ex-
presses the standard error as a percentage of the esti-
mate. The relative standard error ranged from 16.5%
in 1971 to 11.1% in 1982.
For the purposes of this study, the appropriate code
from the International Classification of Disease was
determined for endarterectomy for vessels of head and
neck. For the years 1971 through 1978 the code 26.1
from the Eighth Revision International Classification
of Diseases, Adapted for Use in the United States
(ICDA-8)3 was used and for the years 1979 through
1982 the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)6
code 38.12 was used.
Federal Hospitals
The Biometrics Division of the Veterans Adminis-
tration was contacted. They did have actual counts on
the ICDA-8 code 26.1 for the years beginning October
1, 1977, 1978, and 1979.' For the years beginning
October 1, 1980 and 1981, the ICD-9-CM code 38.1
was used but the second digit was not used and; there-
fore, the procedures were for all endarterectomies not
just for those of extracranial vessels.
The statistics of endarterectomies performed in the
Armed Forces hospitals were obtained by direct con-
tact with the Departments of Army,2 Air Force,3 and
Navy." For the calendar years 1971 through 1979 the
ICDA-8 code 26.1 was used (all endarterectomies of
head and neck and base of brain) and for the years 1980
through 1982 the International Classification of Proce-
dures in Medicine (ICPM) code 538.1 was used (all
endarterectomies except coronary).
Results
The number of endarterectomies of the head and
neck has increased steadily during the 12-hour period
1971 through 1982 (table 1). From an estimated
15,000 such procedures in non-federal hospitals in
1971, this procedure was performed approximately
82,000 times in non-federal hospitals in 1982 and
around 3,000 times in federal facilities. This repre-
sents a 4.7-fold increase in non-federal hospitals and
about a 2.9-fold increase in Army, Navy, Air Force
and Veterans Administration hospitals.
Data for the largest population represented here, the
civilian population, were obtained from a survey in
which estimates of events less than 10,000 are consid-

ered unreliable. For this reason, for each year the esti-
mates of patients who had undergone endarterectomies
and were discharged dead are not presented in Table 1.
However, the percent of patients who had this proce-
dure and were discharged dead was fairly consistent
for each of the 12 years under study, and averaged
2.8% of all endarterectomy discharges. This appears to
be slightly higher than the percent of deaths in federal
hospitals.
Discussion
The increase of procedures from approximately
15,000 in 1971 to approximately 85,000 in 1982 is
difficult to understand in light of the lack of objective,
double-blind prospective controlled studies to demon-
strate that endarterectomy is clearly advantageous to
medical therapy. This 467% increase must be based on
the opinion of the surgeons that the procedure is of
considerable value. One can neither refute nor support
this concept on the basis of available data. Dr. Jack
Whisnant, in his recent review of the decline of
stroke,7 estimated that there were probably only ap-
proximately 35,000 patients each year who would
have appropriate symptomatic angiographic lesions. If
his calculations are correct, even if surgery were ap-
propriate for each of these 35,000 cases, there still
would be 50,000 procedures for indications that are not
generally accepted. Thus, it is possible that between
1,000 and 1,800 patients die following a surgical pro-
cedure that many physicians might not have agreed

stroke occurs from one to five times as often as death
following endarterectomy,8"14 an additional 1,000 to
9,000 persons in this group may have had a stroke.
This would result in a combined mortality and morbid-
ity of 2,000 to 10,800. These data are quite sobering
and certainly should not be dismissed lightly.

Metropolitan Area

SUMMARY All carotid endarterectomies performed in the greater Cincinnati metropolitan area during
1980 were reviewed. For the 431 procedures performed in 16 hospitals, the operative stroke rate was 8.6%
(37 of 431), and the operative mortality rate was 2.8% (12 of 431). The combined morbidity and mortality
was 9.5% (41 of 431). Fifty percent of the procedures were done for asymptomatic carotid disease (216 of
431) and 50% were done for symptomatic carotid disease (215 of 431). The stroke rate was 5.6% for the
asymptomatic patients and 11.6% for the symptomatic patients (difference significant, p < 0.05). Neuro-
surgeons and vascular surgeons had similar surgical morbidity. All of the operative strokes involved the
hemisphere ipsilateral to the endarterectomy. Fifty-seven percent of the operative strokes (21 of 37)
occurred after a neurologicalty intact interval lasting hours to days. Four occurred following combined
endarterectomy-coronary bypass surgery, and one was an intracerebral hemorrhage. The other late strokes
(17) occurred without evidence for cardiac embolus or hemorrhage, consistent with a thrombogenic-
embologenic operative site, and raising the question of need for adjunctive perioperative medical therapy.

the comparisons of the surgical morbidity and mortal-
