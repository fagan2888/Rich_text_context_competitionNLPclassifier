THE National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
(NSHAP) aims to decipher biological mechanisms
through which social, including sexual, relationships affect
health at older ages. Although population-based studies of
aging are increasingly collecting biological measures to ex-
plore social-physiological hypotheses about health (Lindau
& McDade, 2007), NSHAP is unique in its collection of sex
hormonal data for this purpose. Conducted between July
2005 and March 2006, the first wave of NSHAP included
self-administered salivary specimen collection to begin to
explore the relationship between sex hormone status, rela-
tionships, and health in later life.
Sex hormonal evaluation in the clinical setting is typically
performed on a serum or plasma specimen (Kaufman &
Vermeulen, 2005) and can provide information about total
and free circulating sex hormones. This involves an invasive
procedure (venipuncture). Most steroid hormones in blood
are bound to specific proteins (e.g., sex hormone­binding
globulin [SHBG]).A tiny fraction (less than 5%) of nonbound
or free fraction of sex hormone accounts for actual sex hor-
mone activity at the tissue level. Free sex hormone molecules
are small relative to their bound, protein­steroid complex;
when free, these molecules can penetrate small membranes
such as those found in the salivary gland. Salivary sex hor-
mone measures quantify free, or bioactive, sex hormone con-
centration (Lu, Bentley, Gann, Hodges, & Chatterton, 1999;
Worthman, Stallings, & Hofman, 1990). Salivary measures of-
fer a relatively convenient and minimally invasive approach
for obtaining sex hormone data (Granger, Shirtcliff, Booth,
Kivlighan, & Schwartz, 2004; E. Kaufman & Lamster, 2002;
Worthman et al., 1990)--an advantage when working with
older, infirm, and/or population-based health study partici-
pants. Saliva specimens can be self-collected and safely han-
dled by lay personnel (Granger et al., 2007).
The methods used for, correlates of cooperation with, and
validity of in-home salivary specimens collected from older
adults in NSHAP are described.
Background
Sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
DHEA) derive from the precursor cholesterol (Greenspan &
Gardner, 2001) and play an important role in human physi-
ology throughout the life course. Estrogens are more preva-
lent in women of reproductive age compared with men and
are responsible for development of female secondary sex
characteristics. Three major estrogens are found naturally in
the human body: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3),

Objectives. To describe the methods used for, correlates of cooperation with, and validity of in-home salivary speci-
mens collected from older adults.
Methods. Salivary specimens were collected between 2005 and 2006 during in-home interviews with a probability
sample of 3,005 U.S. men and women, ages 57­85 years. Sex hormone levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immuno-
assay conducted at Salimetrics, LLC (State College, PA). Mean salivary sex hormone concentrations were compared by
gender and in relation to medication use and health conditions.
Results. Self-collected saliva specimens were provided by 2,722 (90.6%) individuals; 95.8% of these were adequate for
analysis. Black participants were significantly less likely than individuals of other racial/ethnic groups to provide a salivary
specimen; age, gender, education, and self-rated health were not associated with participation. Mean testosterone levels were
higher in men compared with women, and estradiol levels were higher in women using estrogens. Salivary hormone measure-
ments obtained in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) and other studies are of similar magnitude.
Conclusion. NSHAP is the first large, population-based study of older adults to measure salivary estradiol, progesterone,
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and, in women, testosterone. These data demonstrate a high cooperation rate with
in-home salivary specimen collection from older adults and good validity of sex hormone measurements.

with the weak estrogen. estriol. being the most abundant
(Greenspan & Gardner, 2001; Speroff, Glass, & Kase, 1999).
Estradiol (17-beta-estradiol), the most potent bioactive estro-
gen, is primarily synthesized from testosterone in the ovarian
follicles in females whereas in males, it is produced by the
testes and extraglandular conversion of androgens (Salimet-
rics, 2006; Tivis, Richardson, Peddi, & Arjmandi, 2005). Es-
trogen exerts central (brain) (Rehman & Masson, 2005) and
peripheral (reproductive tract, mammary gland, skeletal, car-
diovascular) effects (Hall, Couse, & Korach, 2001).
Estrogen metabolism and synthesis in men appear to re-
main relatively stable across the life course (Kaufman &
Vermeulen, 2005). In contrast, major changes in sex hor-
mone metabolism occur in women around natural meno-
pause, most notably due to a decline in ovarian estrogen
production (Manly et al., 2000). Although the human
lifespan is increasing, the mean age of menopause has not
changed as rapidly. Life expectancy at birth for American
women increased from 56.2 years for women born in 1910
to 69.4 years for women born in 1940 (158 month increase)
(Bell & Miller, 2002). At the same time, the mean age at
natural menopause for U.S. women born in 1915 versus
1939 increased from 49.1 to 50.5 years (16.8 month in-
crease) (Nichols et al., 2006). Women are therefore living
increasingly longer in a menopausal state.
Relative estrogen depletion in women in later life has
been associated with a variety of age-related changes in
physical and cognitive function as well as disease. Among
men and women, serum estradiol concentration has been
associated with bone turnover and risk for osteoporotic
fractures (lower estrogen is associated with skeletal vulner-
ability) (Kuchuk et al., 2007). Likewise, estradiol concen-
tration has been associated with cognition (Carlson et al.,
2001; Maki & Resnick, 2000; Tivis et al., 2005), mood, and
memory (Tivis et al., 2005) in women and, in combination
with testosterone levels and other factors, with preservation
of memory and cognitive function in men (Barrett-Connor,
Goodman-Gruen, & Patay, 1999; Carlson & Sherwin,
2000). A number of studies have linked higher levels of se-
rum estradiol to increased risk for developing breast cancer
(Chlebowski et al., 2003; Clemons & Goss, 2001; Tivis
et al., 2005) and coronary problems (Chlebowski et al.,
2003; Clemons & Goss, 2001; Manson et al., 2003; Tivis et
al., 2005) in women. Much less is known about the role of
estrogen in social functioning in general or in later life.
Estrogen depletion in menopause and sustained, low lev-
els of circulating estrogen throughout the postmenopausal
lifespan significantly affect the condition and function of
the female genital tract. Estrogen is important for maintain-
ing skin, subcutaneous, mucosal (vaginal, bladder, and
rectal) and musculoskeletal integrity, the vaginal microen-
vironment (pH balance and microflora), vascular flow to the
vagina and clitoris, and sensory perception. Over time, in
the genital tract, low estrogen results in vaginal dryness,
loss of epithelial cell glycogen, shortening of the vagina,
narrowing of the introitus, thinning of the labia, and dimi-
nution of the fat pad underlying the mons pubis. Though the
role of estrogen in female sexuality is not fully understood,
it may influence sexual desire (Dennerstein, Gotts, et al.,
1994; Meston & Frohlich, 2000). Estrogen replacement
therapy may indirectly enhance female sexual performance,
by restoring vaginal lubrication (Meston & Frohlich) and
promoting positive body image and an overall positive sense
of well-being (Bachmann & Leiblum, 2004). Additionally,
sexual activity and other forms of physical contact may
mitigate estrogen-related decline in sensory perception and
function with age and may play a role in female attractive-
ness. Largely due to highly publicized findings in 2002 from
the randomized, controlled hormone therapy trials of the
U.S. Women's Health Initiative Study (comparing use of
equine estrogen alone or in combination with medroxypro-
gesterone to placebo among post menopausal women ages
50­79 years at baseline) (Rossouw et al., 2002), a minority
of women currently initiate estrogen therapy for treatment
of menopausal symptoms or preservation of sexual function
(Newton et al., 2008).
Progesterone is found in both women and men, although the
physiological role in men is poorly understood (Andersen &
Tufik, 2006). In reproductive age females, the primary function
of progesterone involves preparation and maintenance of the
endometrium for implantation of fertilized oocytes (Speroff
et al., 1999). In women, progesterone is synthesized from preg-
nenolone in the adrenal cortex, corpus luteum of the ovary, in
the brain, and during pregnancy, by the placenta. Due to decline
in ovarian production, progesterone production is markedly de-
creased following menopause. This decline may result in di-
minished sexual function and desire (Dennerstein, Alexander,
& Kotz, 2003). Increased levels of progesterone have been
found in states of stress and anxiety in men and women; this
may relate to its sedative or stress-counteracting effects (Wirth,
Meier, Fredrickson, & Shcultheiss, 2007; Wirth & Schultheiss,
2006). Exogenous progesterone is used in older women primar-
ily in combination with estrogen therapy to protect against es-
trogen's growth-promoting effects on the uterine endometrial
lining and to treat pathological processes of the uterine endo-
metrium. In men, exogenous progesterone has been used to re-
duce sexual activity, a mechanism of action that may relate to its
antiandrogenic properties (Andersen & Tufik, 2006).
Testosterone is the defining male sex hormone, is more
abundant in males than females, but appears to play an im-
portant physiological role in sexual functioning of both.
Testosterone is synthesized in the male testes, the female
ovaries, and the adrenal glands in both sexes (Davis & Tran,
2001; Guyton, 1991). During the aging process, testoster-
one levels gradually decline in both sexes (Davis & Tran;
Ellison et al., 2002; Feldman et al., 2002; Lobo, 2001;
Tenover, 1997). Because the ovaries are a primary, and rela-
tively stable, source of female testosterone production
throughout the life course (Davis & Tran, 2001), premeno-
pausal bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of both
GAVRILOVA AND LINDAU
i96
ovaries prior to onset of natural menopause) results in abrupt
and irreversible loss of the major source of testosterone in
women (Hendrix, 2005; Laughlin, Barrett-Connor, Kritz-
Silverstein, & von Muhlen, 2000). About 22 million women
undergo surgical menopause each year in the United States
(Keshavarz, Hillis, Kieke, & Marchbanks, 2002). Because
estrogen synthesis largely derives from ovarian testosterone
postmenopausally, surgical removal of the ovaries also ex-
acerbates the estrogen deficit in these women.
In both sexes, decline in testosterone levels leads to bone
density loss (Davis & Tran, 2001; Jassal, Barrett-Connor, &
Edelstein, 1995; Lobo, 2001; Tenover, 1997) and decline in
muscle mass (Ellison et al., 2002; Lobo, 2001). Testoster-
one, along with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), plays an
important role in female libido, arousal, genital sensation,
and orgasm. Loss of testosterone can exacerbate vaginal
mucosal atrophy, thinning of public hair, and may compro-
mise an older woman's sense of general well-being. Low
levels of testosterone have been correlated with lower coital
frequency and loss of sexual desire in men and women
(Davis & Tran, 2001), although the relationship between
female sexual interest in later life and testosterone levels is
controversial (Davis & Tran, 2001; Dennerstein, Smith,
Morse, & Burger, 1994). Testosterone administration may
improve mood and well-being in both sexes, especially
among men (Ellison et al., 2001; Grinspoon et al., 2000;
Jassal et al., 1995). Circulating testosterone in women is a
strong correlate of ovarian function and androgen production,
though approximately one third of circulating levels are de-
rived via precursors from the adrenal gland (Lobo, 2001).
DHEA and its sulfate (DHEA-S) are produced by the
cortex of the adrenal gland (Williams & Wilson, 1998) and
act as precursors to approximately half of the active andro-
gen concentration in adult men (Regelson, Loria, & Kalimi,
1994). DHEA production and concentration decline is
significant and steady during human aging (Hackbert &
Heiman, 2002; Ravaglia et al., 1996; Speroff et al., 1999;
Villareal & Holloszy, 2004) in both males and females
(Labrie, Belanger, Cusan, Gomez, & Candas, 1997; Panjari
& Davis, 2007) and, therefore, has been suggested as a puta-
tive biomarker of physiologic aging (Johnson, Bebb, & Sirrs,
2002). Low levels of endogenous DHEA concentration are
associated with cardiovascular disease (Alexandersen,
Haarbo, & Christiansen, 1996), progression of HIV infec-
tion (Christeff et al., 1996), symptomatic progression of sys-
temic lupus erythematosus (Spark, 2002), presence of
rheumatoid arthritis among postmenopausal women (Masi,
1995), bone resorption, and skin pigmentation (Spark, 2002).
DHEA has been studied for its role in mood and well-being
(Hackbert & Heiman, 2002; Spark, 2002), sexual physiol-
ogy, and treatment of sexual problems (Spark, 2002).
Methods
Details of the NSHAP sample design and participant char-
acteristics have been previously described (Lindau et al.,
2007). The survey yielded 3,005 respondents (1,455 men
and 1,550 women) ages 57­84 years. The weighted sample
response rate was 75.5%. Here, we describe the collection of
saliva specimens and details of the sex hormone assays. In
addition to assays for DHEA, testosterone, progesterone, and
estradiol, an assay for cotinine (a primary metabolite of nico-
tine) was performed. The salivary cotinine measure is de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (Drum, Shiovitz-Ezra, Gaumer, &
Lindau, in press).
Saliva Specimen Collection and Processing
Details of the salivary assays collected in the NSHAP
study have been previously described (Mendoza, Curran, &
Lindau, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c; Nallanathan, Mendoza, Curran,
& Lindau, 2007). Approximately midway through the in-
home interview, salivary specimens were collected from all
willing respondents. Following procedures developed by
Granger and colleagues (2007), whole unstimulated saliva
was collected by passive drool. Approximately 2 mililiters
of saliva was donated into a small, code-labeled polypropyl-
ene collection vial via a 5 centimeter section of a household
plastic straw. The time of last food consumption and time of
the saliva specimen collection were recorded. To minimize
the effects of room temperature on salivary analyte levels
(Whembolua, Granger, Kivlighan, Marguin, & Singer,
2006), samples were transported on cold packs immediately
after collection, from the interview site to a residential-
grade freezer (-20 °C) where they were stored until shipped
via overnight delivery on dry ice to Salimetrics laboratories
(State College, PA). Upon receipt, specimens were invento-
ried and then archived at -80 °C until the day of assay.
Hormone Assays
The salivary enzyme immunoassays were conducted at
Salimetrics, LLC. On the day of assay, specimens were
thawed completely, vortexed, and centrifuged at 1,500 × g
(3,000 rpm) for 15 minutes. Clear samples were pipetted in
duplicate into test wells using a 96-well plate format. To
minimize the effects of freeze thaw cycles on assay results,
the analyses were scheduled in the following priority order:
(a) estradiol, (b) progesterone, (c) DHEA, (d) testosterone,
and (e) cotinine. All assays were conducted using commer-
cially available immunoassay kits without modification to
the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Salimetrics).
Assays were performed in duplicate with the average of the
duplicate tests used in all analyses. The criteria for repeated
testing was variation greater than 20% between duplicates,
and on average, the assay protocols had intra- and interas-
say coefficients of variation less than 10% and 15%, re-
spectively. Hormone values were measured in picograms
per milliliter and cotinine in nanograms per milliliter. As
expected, hormonal therapies (oral, transdermal, topical)
cross-react with the detection antibodies used in these
assays, resulting in high salivary hormone measurements.
SALIVARY SEX HORMONE MEASUREMENT i97
Sex hormone measurements that exceeded the upper bound-
ary of assay and results below the assay limit of sensitivity
are flagged in the publicly available NSHAP data set and
summarized in Table 1. More details on the quality control
issues regarding each sex hormone assay can be found in
previously published NSHAP Technical Reports (Mendoza
et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2007c; Nallanathan et al., 2007).
Values for each duplicate assay are included in the public-use
data set. Missing codes and flags describe problems encoun-
tered in obtaining an adequate specimen for sex hormone anal-
ysis (e.g., insufficient sample quantity, equipment problems).
Variables Used in the Analysis
Data are presented for three age strata to correspond with
the age structure of the NSHAP sample design: 57­64, 65­74
years, and 75­85 years (O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, &
Smith, in review). Gender was assessed by field staff observa-
tion. Race and ethnicity were self-reported and categorized as
White, Black, Hispanic, and other. Education level was di-
chotomized as "high school and below" and "some college
and higher." Respondents were asked to rate their physical
health using the standard 5-point scale with responses "excel-
lent," "very good," "good," "fair," and "poor." For these ana-
lyses, we use three self-rated health categories: "very good/
excellent," "good," and "fair/poor."
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using the Stata statistical
software package, release 9 (StataCorp, 2005). Logistic re-
gression (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 1989) was used to model
the likelihood of participating in the saliva collection. This
model included age group, gender, race/ethnicity, education,
and self-rated health as covariates. Results are presented as
odds ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. To ac-
count for the unequal probabilities of selection, we performed
weighted analyses using the probability weights with a post-
stratification adjustment based on age and urbanicity. Infer-
ence was conducted using design-based variance estimates,
obtained via the linearization method (Binder, 1983) as im-
plemented in Stata (StataCorp, 2005). Differences between
means were evaluated using the adjusted Wald test. All p val-
ues reported are two sided from the adjusted Wald test.
Assessment of Internal and External Validity
Internal validity of sex hormone measurements was first
assessed by gender comparison of saliva testosterone levels,
which are expected to be higher in men compared with
women (Shirtcliff, Granger, & Likos, 2002). Internal valid-
ity of the saliva sex hormone measurements was further
assessed by evaluation of association between specific sex
hormone concentrations and corresponding health condi-
tions or behaviors, including use of exogenous sex hor-
mones or hormone blockers, obesity, and oophorectomy.
History of ovary removal (oophorectomy) was determined
on the basis of self-report. Medication data were collected
during the in-home interview by direct observation using a
computer-based medication log. Usage of hormones in-
cluded hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives
by women and androgens and anabolic steroids (predomi-
nantly for stimulation of muscle growth) by men and
women. Antiandrogenic medication use by men was also
logged. Obesity was defined as body mass index of 30 kg/m2
or higher (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
2000).
External validation of sex hormone measurements in
the NSHAP sample was conducted using comparison with
published data on salivary levels of estradiol, progesterone,
DHEA, and testosterone among older men and women
(when data on older age groups were available).
Results
Participant Cooperation in Saliva Collection
Self-collected saliva specimens were provided by 2,722
(90.6%, unweighted) individuals. Table 2 shows the asso-
ciations of individual sociodemographic and health charac-
teristics with the likelihood of participation in the saliva
collection. Blacks were significantly less likely to partici-
pate in saliva collection than whites. Other characteristics of
respondents, including age, gender, and self-reported health,
were not significantly associated with participation in the
saliva protocol.
Explanation of Missing Data
Of 2,722 respondents who agreed to provide a saliva
sample, 82 (3.0%) specimens were inadequate (mainly due
to inability to produce a sufficient amount of saliva). Figure 1
shows the disposition of specimens at various stages of
collection, transportation, and measurement. In the pro-
cess of saliva collection and transportation, freezing was

compromised for 20 samples although these samples were
still adequate for sex hormone measurements; these were
included in the hormone measurement protocol. Inade-
quate freezing of these samples is flagged in the public-use
data set. Twenty samples with reported freezing problems
during saliva transportation and storage were excluded
from further analyses of sex hormone levels in this study.
Interference with both measures for each hormone assay,
due to food or drink consumption (mean time since con-
sumption 3.44 hr, SD = 3.08) or other factors, was likely for
4.1% of estradiol assays, 1.0% of progesterone assays, 1.3%
of DHEA assays, and 0.08% of testosterone assays. The
proportion of assays where both measurements were below
the boundary of sensitivity was 0.46% for estradiol, 0.08%
for progesterone, 0.04% for DHEA, and 0.15% for testos-
terone. Overall, the vast majority of specimens processed
for sex hormone analysis were adequate: estradiol (97%),
progesterone (96%), DHEA (93%), and testosterone (90%).
The declining adequacy rate corresponds with the priority
order in which the assays were performed.
Internal and External Validity of Sex Steroid Hormone
Measurement
Mean and median values of sex hormone measurements,
stratified by gender, are presented in Table 3.
Men demonstrated higher levels of testosterone. The
mean testosterone level for men (99.5 pg/ml) was about
twice that of women (46.3 pg/ml). The mean salivary estra-
diol levels were nearly equivalent for men and women.

SALIVARY SEX HORMONE MEASUREMENT i99
women using exogenous sex hormones (n = 160, 12.3%
overall), 158 were using estrogen. Of these, 24 were using
estrogen in combination with a progestin and 6 were using
estrogen in combination with an androgen product. One
woman used only androgen and one woman used only pro-
gestin supplementation. Women taking estrogen alone or in
combination therapy (n = 158, 10.2% overall) exhibited sig-
nificantly higher levels of salivary estradiol compared with
nonusers (see Table 4).
Internal validity of the saliva sex hormone measurements
was further assessed by evaluation of sex hormone levels in
obese men and women, men taking drugs with antiandro-
genic and androgenic activity, and women with a history of
bilateral oophorectomy (Table 5).
Few men (n = 39, 2.5% overall) reported exogenous sex
hormone use or use of other medications affecting sex hor-
mone metabolism. Of these, 32 were using 5-alpha-reductase
inhibitors. These drugs reduce circulating androgens by re-
ducing conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and
are used most commonly in the treatment of benign prostatic
hyperplasia. Six men used androgens or anabolic steroids and
one man reported progestin use. Although the associations
were not statistically significant (the subgroups were very
small), men taking 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors exhibit
slightly lower concentrations of salivary testosterone com-
pared with nonusers of this drug. Likewise, men taking andro-
gens or anabolic steroids exhibit higher levels of testosterone
(again, this association was not statistically significant due to
the small number of men taking anabolic steroids).
Bilateral oophorectomy was reported by 392 women in
the sample. Ovaries are the predominant source of androgen
production in postmenopausal women. Testosterone levels
were lower in ovariectomized women (44.23 ± 1.33 pg/ml)
as compared with women with at least one ovary (47.03 ±
0.94 pg/ml), but this difference was not statistically signifi-
cant. Only 6 of 392 ovariectomized women used androgen
replacement therapy. Salivary testosterone concentration in
these women was only slightly higher as compared with
those not using androgen supplementation (50.8 ± 6.08 vs.
44.1 ± 1.31 pg/ml, respectively); this difference was not sta-
tistically significant. Obese men and women demonstrate
higher levels of testosterone compared with nonobese par-
ticipants; testosterone levels among obese women were sig-
nificantly higher than among nonobese women (Table 5).
Tables 6 and 7 compare salivary measurements of estra-
diol, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone in women and
men with those reported by other studies. Overall, salivary
levels of sex hormones demonstrate significant variability
dependent on age, gender, season of the year, and time of the
day (see Tables 6 and 7). Where comparable data are avail-
able, salivary sex hormone data from NSHAP are similar to
other published findings for progesterone, testosterone, and
estradiol (Tables 6 and 7). The mean estradiol concentration
reported by Krause and colleagues for older men (Krause,
Mueller, & Mazur, 2002) is very similar to estradiol levels
found in NSHAP for older women and men (Tables 6
and 7). Salivary DHEA concentrations in NSHAP are lower
than those reported in the literature for younger people.

Discussion
The NSHAP study provides the first population-repre-
sentative data on salivary sex hormone concentrations in a
national, population-based sample of older community-
residing adults in the United States. Use of minimally inva-
sive methods for collection of sex hormonal data is feasible
and provides information relevant to furthering an under-
standing of the role of sex hormones in relation to sexuality
in later life, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other chronic
conditions of aging. Population data complement clinical
data by providing normative information.
Although saliva collection via passive drool may be dif-
ficult for older adults due to aging-related changes in saliva
production (Hodgson, Freedman, Granger, & Erno, 2004),
medication side effects causing dry mouth, and manual
manipulation of the small collection devices, overall coop-
eration with the home-based protocol was high in this pop-
ulation-based sample of older adults. Blacks were less likely
to provide saliva samples during the interview. The National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has
also reported relatively lower participation of this racial
group in biological measure protocols, specifically collection
of DNA from blood. In that study, removal of language in
the consent process that linked blood collection to genetic
research increased participation in every demographic cat-
egory (McQuillan, Pan, & Porter, 2006). Cooperation with

SALIVARY SEX HORMONE MEASUREMENT i101
the NSHAP saliva collection protocol was higher than that
accomplished for HIV testing, blood spots, or vaginal swab
collection in the NSHAP study (Lindau et al., in press;
Williams & McDade, in press). Although, in the case of
vaginal swab sampling, differences in cooperation were
found by age and education (older age, less educated were
less likely to participate) but not by race/ethnicity (Lindau
et al., in press). This may be due to the relative invasiveness
of the collection protocols or other factors and requires
more investigation.
Internal validity of the salivary sex hormone measure-
ments is suggested by the expected findings of higher tes-
tosterone concentrations in men versus women (Shirtcliff
et al., 2002) and similar estradiol concentrations in women
and men (Greenblatt, Oettinger, & Bohler, 1976; Shirtcliff
et al., 2002). The proportion of individuals using exogenous
hormones was small in the NSHAP sample, as is true in the
population as a whole (Wysowski, Golden, & Burke, 1995).
Salivary testosterone concentrations in ovariectomized
women and in men using androgens were also shifted in
the expected direction (Adashi, 1994; Cappola et al., 2007).
Estrogen use in women was significantly correlated with
higher salivary estradiol concentrations as reported by other
authors (Tivis et al., 2005). Obesity is associated with lower
production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in both
women and men; consistent with this, and as has been ob-
served previously (Cappola et al., 2007; Lukanova et al.,
2004; Schilling et al., 2007), obese women in NSHAP exhibit
higher levels of free salivary testosterone. The expected rela-
tionship between obesity and free testosterone in men is less
clear, and in NSHAP, obese men do not demonstrate signifi-
cantly different levels of free testosterone than non-obese
men. This may be because both SHBG and total testosterone
arelowerinobeseascomparedwithothermen(Allan,Strauss,
Burger, Forbes, & McLachlan, 2006; Derby, Zilber, Bram-
billa, Morales, & McKinlay, 2006; Giagulli, Kaufman, &
Vermeulen, 1994).
Normative data on salivary sex hormone concentrations
in later life are scarce. As a result, external validation of
NSHAP data is particularly difficult for progesterone and
DHEA in men and estradiol, DHEA, and testosterone in
women. Most existing data derive from small, clinical
populations of young volunteers. One population-based
study collected salivary specimens from 48 "randomly se-
lected," healthy, heterosexual, cohabiting men ages 50­80
years, from Mannheim, Germany, and 50 similar men
from State College, Pennsylvania (Krause et al., 2002). In
that study, salivary measures of DHEA-S (but not DHEA),
testosterone, and estradiol were obtained (see Table 7).
The concentrations of testosterone and estradiol are simi-
lar to those obtained in the NSHAP study. Some studies
report lower levels of estradiol (Schultheiss, Dargel, &
Rohde, 2003; Tivis et al., 2005) than those obtained in the
NSHAP study, although other authors report similar levels
of salivary estradiol (Emaus et al., 2008; Nunez-De La
Mora, Bentley, Choudhury, Napolitano, & Chatterton, 2008;
Rantala, Enksson, Vainikka, & Kortet, 2006). Estradiol mea-
surements in the NSHAP study contain a small number of
cases with very high values. For this reason, median (rather
than mean) values of salivary estradiol in the NSHAP study

show better agreement with the reported data from other stud-
ies (see Tables 3, 6, and 7).
Mean progesterone values for women in NSHAP are sim-
ilar to those reported by Salimetrics for postmenopausal
women using the same assay procedures (Nallanathan et al.,
2007). As in the case of estradiol, progesterone measure-
ments contain outliers, so median levels of salivary proges-
terone in the NSHAP study (29.8 pg/ml for men and 24.6
pg/ml for women) demonstrate better agreement with the re-
ported data from other studies (Celec et al., 2006; Jasienska
& Jasienski, 2008; Wirth et al., 2007) compared with mean
values (see Tables 6 and 7).
Salivary DHEA measurements reported for younger
adults by other studies (Granger, Schwartz, Booth, Curran,
& Zakaria, 1999; Harris et al., 2000; van Niekerk, Huppert,
& Herbert, 2001) are higher than found in the NSHAP
study, as expected due to age-related decline of DHEA
(Ahn, Lee, Choi, Kwon, & Chun, 2007; Granger et al.,
1999). DHEA concentrations measured in serum have gen-
erally been reported to be similar in men and women, al-
though DHEA levels in men are nearly always higher than
in women (Rehman & Carr, 2004). In the NSHAP sample,
men exhibit consistently higher concentrations of DHEA
compared with women. This may be related to more rapid
decline of DHEA levels with age in women than in men,
although more studies are needed to clarify this gender
difference.
Compared with younger adults (Brown et al., 2008; Flegr,
Lindova, & Kodym, 2008; Shirtcliff et al., 2002), testoster-
one levels obtained in the NSHAP study are lower. For older
men, the levels of salivary testosterone obtained in the NS-
HAP study and in another population-based study (Krause
et al., 2002) are very similar (see Tables 6 and 7). Overall,
due to varying assay techniques, study populations and
study conditions, salivary hormone measurements obtained
across studies are difficult to compare; those reported here
are of similar magnitude to findings in the most comparable
studies.
Minimally invasive, valid, and reliable methods of sex hor-
mone measurements in saliva can enhance the application of
population-based aging research to understanding of disease
and function in later life. For example, low levels of endoge-
nous DHEA and testosterone in men are related to decreased
survival (Khaw et al., 2007; Maggio et al., 2007; Shores,
Matsumoto, Sloan, & Kivlahan, 2006), higher risk for car-
diovascular diseases (Choi & McLaughlin, 2007;
Jankowska et al., 2006; Khaw et al., 2007), and depression
(Morsink et al., 2007). Overall, circulating endogenous sex
hormones including estrogens have a neutral or beneficial ef-
fect on cardiovascular disease in men (Muller, van der Schouw,
Thijssen, & Grobbee, 2003). High estrogen levels in women
may be linked to increased risk of breast (Dorgan et al.,
2002; Hankinson & Eliassen, 2007) and uterine (Akhmed-
khanov, Zeleniuch-Jacquotte, & Toniolo, 2001) cancer. The
association between estradiol and cognitive function is
complex. Although in vitro studies demonstrated beneficial
effects of estrogen on the brain (Ravaglia et al., 2007), recent
longitudinal studies showed positive association of endoge-
nous estradiol and risk for vascular dementia (Geerlings
et al., 2003) and Alzheimer's disease (Ravaglia et al., 2007)
in women but not in men. The NSHAP data set can be used
to further explore the relationships between disease, function,
and sex hormones in later life. For example, our recent study
using NSHAP data shows that higher levels of some sex hor-
mones are correlated with better sexual performance in
older women (Lindau & Gavrilova, 2008).
Conclusion
Experience from the NSHAP study demonstrates that
collection of salivary specimens from older men and women
in an in-home, population-based study using nonmedical
field staff is feasible and that the data are internally and ex-
ternally valid. The cooperation rate for this minimally inva-
sive procedure is high. Saliva specimens provide novel sex
hormone data of relevance to studying health and illness in
later life.
