ABSTRACT
The vector-borne pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi, causes a
multi-system disorder including neurological complications.
These neurological disorders, collectively termed neurobor-
reliosis, can occur in up to 15% of untreated patients. The
neurological symptoms are probably a result of a glial-driven,
host inflammatory response to the bacterium. However, the
specific contributions of individual glial and other support
cell types to the pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis are rela-
tively unexplored. The goal of this project was to charac-
terize specific astrocyte and endothelial cell responses to
B. burgdorferi. Primary human astrocytes and primary HB-
MEC (human brain microvascular endothelial cells) were in-
cubated with B. burgdorferi over a 72-h period and the
transcriptional responses to the bacterium were analyzed
by real-time PCR arrays. There was a robust increase in
several surveyed chemokine and related genes, including
IL (interleukin)-8, for both primary astrocytes and HBMEC.
Array results were confirmed with individual sets of PCR
primers. The production of specific chemokines by both as-
trocytes and HBMEC in response to B. burgdorferi, including
IL-8, CXCL-1, and CXCL-10, were confirmed by ELISA. These
results demonstrate that primary astrocytes and HBMEC re-
spond to virulent B. burgdorferi by producing a number
of chemokines. These data suggest that infiltrating phago-

INTRODUCTION
Many microorganisms can cause inflammation in the CNS
(central nervous system) by damaging the protective barriers
that sequester the brain from the periphery. These `neu-
rovascular units', which include vascular endothelia, glia, and
neurons, work together to maintain normal brain function
(Grab et al., 2011). Breakdown of the BBB (blood­brain bar-
rier) and blood­CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) barrier can facilitate
entry of both microorganisms and activated immune cells
into the CNS. Of critical importance to the development and
maintenance of the BBB is the astrocyte. Astrocytes are glial
cells that vastly outnumber neurons in the brain. Astrocytes
are involved in metabolic interactions with neurons, and
also form close associations with endothelia and fibroblasts
(Magistretti and Ransom, 2002). The interaction of astrocytic
endfeet with the endothelium of the BBB is key to the

induction of many barrier properties, including tight junction
formation and the expression and localization of trans-
porters. Astrocytes and the endothelium of the BBB respond
to various insults by producing a wide range of chemokines
and neurotrophic agents. Their close association with many
cell types of the CNS and its barriers highlights the impor-
tance of understanding the response of astrocytes and brain
endothelial cells to pathogens that cause neuroinflammation.
Over 90% of all arthropod-borne diseases in the USA is
caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Radolf et al.,
2012). B. burgdorferi is the agent of Lyme disease, which can
manifest in skin, joints, the heart, and the brain. Neurobor-
reliosis, which occurs in up to 15% of untreated patients
(Hildenbrand et al., 2009), results in meningitis, headache,
and facial nerve palsy (Rupprecht et al., 2008). Peripheral
nerve disease is also common, and long-term symptoms re-
main in up to 50% of patients even 5 years post-treatment
(Ljostad and Henriksen, 2008). The ability of B. burgdorferi to
infect immunocompetent humans and other vertebrates for
extensive periods of time, (Moody et al., 1990; de Souza et al.,
1993; Steere, 2001; Miller et al., 2003; Stanek and Strle, 2003)
coupled with the potential for long-term sequelae, make this
disease particularly insidious.
The Lyme disease spirochete has an affinity for the CNS
(Rupprecht et al., 2008). B. burgdorferi can be isolated from
the CSF of humans as early as 18 days after the bite of an
infected tick (Fallon et al., 2010). In a rhesus macaque model,
the spirochete can be detected in the leptomeninges, dorsal
root ganglia, and occasionally the parenchyma of the brain
(Cadavid et al., 2000). B. burgdorferi has the potential to
cross the BBB and come into direct contact with the brain
microvascular endothelium and astrocytes. The spirochete
freely crosses brain vascular endothelial cells in the presence
of the proenzyme plasminogen (Grab et al., 2005). Despite
the potential for access and interaction of B. burgdorferi
with glia, almost nothing is known about the interaction of
B. burgdorferi with human astrocytes. In a single published
study in which the Lyme spirochete was incubated with hu-
man astrocytes, the authors found a significant up-regulation
of MMP-9 (matrix metalloprotease 9), which may play a role
in the breakdown of brain barriers (Perides et al., 1999). Sev-
eral studies with murine and non-human primate astrocytes,
however, suggest that these cells could play important roles
in the innate immune response to B. burgdorferi. For exam-
ple, B. burgdorferi induces IL (interleukin)-6, IL-10, and TNF
(tumor necrosis factor ) from murine astrocytes (Chauhan
et al. 2008; 2009), and up-regulates the pattern recognition
receptor NOD2 (Sterka et al., 2006). Astrocytes from non-
human primates respond to B. burgdorferi by up-regulating
IL-6 and the chemokines IL-8, CCL (CC chemokine ligand) 3
and CCL4 (Bernardino et al., 2008).
Similarly, while the response of heart and umbilical en-
dothelial cells to B. burgdorferi has been examined, little is
known about B. burgdorferi interaction with HBMEC (human
brain microvascular endothelial cells), and to our knowledge,
no studies have focused on primary HBMEC (Boggemeyer
et al., 1994; Sellati et al., 1995; Ebnet et al., 1996; Burns
et al., 1997; Gebbia et al., 2001; 2005; Dame et al., 2007;
Ramesh et al., 2009).
Because of the critical roles of astrocytes and HBMEC in
sensing, responding, and adapting the neural environment to
pathogens, and the paucity of data in this regard, we wanted
to delineate the astrocytic response to B. burgdorferi. We
were particularly interested in the expression of chemokines
because of their clear import to the trafficking of leukocytes
to the site of infection. In this work, we demonstrate that
B. burgdorferi up-regulates the expression of several key
chemokines specifically from human astrocytes and HBMEC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary cultures of human astrocytes
Primary cultures of human astrocytes were obtained from
ScienCell Research Laboratories (catalog no.1800) and main-
tained on poly-L-lysine coated flasks (2 g/cm2, T-75) in the
astrocyte medium (ScienCell, catalog no. 1801). To stimulate
the cells, astrocytes were used between passages 3 and 4 at
75% confluence. Prior to Borrelia stimulation, medium was
replaced with antibiotic-free astrocyte medium. Astrocytes
were stimulated with B. burgdorferi at an MOI (multiplicity
of infection) of 40:1 for 6­72 h.
Primary cultures of HBMEC
Primary HBMEC were obtained from ScienCell Research Lab-
oratories (catalog no. 1000) and maintained on fibronectin
coated flasks (2 g/cm2, T-75) in ECM (endothelial cell
medium, ScienCell; catalog # 1001). To stimulate the cells,
HBMEC were used between passages 3 and 4 at 75% con-
fluence. Prior to Borrelia stimulation, ECM was replaced
with ECM minus antibiotics. HBMEC were stimulated with
B. burgdorferi at a MOI of 40:1 for 6­72 h.
Bacterial culture
Virulent Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31 MI-16 (Casjens et al.
2000; Fraser et al. 1997; Miller et al., 2003) was grown at
34C to cell densities of approximately 1×107 /ml in mod-
ified BSK-II (Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly II) medium (Z¨
uckert,
2007). B. burgdorferi was pelleted at 6000 g, washed three
times with PBS, and resuspended in DMEM (Dulbecco's modi-
fied Eagle's medium) without antibiotics. B. burgdorferi were
enumerated by darkfield microscopy using a Petroff-Hausser
chamber. For stimulation experiments, B. burgdorferi was
used at a MOI of 40:1.Total DNA (chromosomal and plas-
mids) was isolated using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qia-
gen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spirochete

viability in the presence of cells and culture medium was
monitored by total motile spirochetes by counting ten ran-
dom fields via darkfield microscopy (Supplementary Figure
S1 at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e119add.htm).
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after aspiration
of media, flasks were washed three times with warm ster-
ile PBS. Cells were detached using Trypsin­EDTA (ScienCell),
trypsin activity was neutralized with the addition of ECM
plus FBS, and the resulting cell slurry was homogenized by
passing through gradually smaller sterile glass pipettes. Cells
were lysed in Buffer RLT (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was re-
moved by on-column DNA digestion with RNase-Free DNase
Set (catalog no. 79254, Qiagen). Following isolation, RNA
was concentrated using Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit
(catalog no. 74204). RNA quality and concentration was as-
sessed spectrophotometrically on a Bio-Tek Epoch (Bio-Tek)
and cDNA synthesis was performed using Qiagen RT2 First
Strand Kit (Catalog no. 330401) according to the manufac-
turer's instructions.
QPCR (quantitative PCR)
The expression of multiple genes was analyzed using RT2
Profiler PCR arrays (SABiosciences; Human Chemokines and
Receptors, catalog no. PAHS-022) on a BioRad myIQ2
real-time PCR instrument. Data were analyzed using SABio-
sciences software. Changes in individual genes were con-
firmed using individual PCR primer sets (SABiosciences;
Table 1). Briefly, each reaction contained 5.5 l nuclease-free
H2
O, 2 ml primer mix at 10 M, and 12.5 l BioRad Syber-
Green Supermix +
-5 l template DNA or water (no template
control). The QPCR was performed in 40 cycles following an
initial 10 min denaturation at 95C. Each cycle consisted of a
1 min annealing step performed at 60C, followed by a 15 s
melting interval at 95C. Product melting curves were gener-
ated at the end of the reaction using a stepped temperature
gradient of 0.5C×10 s starting at 60C. Expression levels
of all transcripts were compared with housekeeping genes
(-actin and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-
genase)) and the relative changes in gene expression were
compared with those of untreated cells using the 2- CT
method where CT
= threshold cycle. This method was used
on each individual example with the untreated sample as
the comparator (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008). All samples
were analyzed in triplicate from at least two independent
biological replicates per time point.
ELISA
Culture supernatants were removed after stimulation and
stored at - 80C. ELISA for IL-8, CXCL-1, and CXCL-10 was
performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D

Systems). Briefly, all reagents were brought to room tempera-
ture and prepared as instructed. Plates were coated overnight
with 100 l of appropriate capture antibody. Following aspi-
ration and wash, 100 l of appropriate chemokine standards,
controls, or sample were added to each well. Plates were incu-
bated for 2 h at room temperature. Following aspiration and
wash, 100 l of antibody conjugate was added to each well,
followed by 2 h incubation at room temperature. Following
aspiration and washes, the chemokine of interest was de-
tected by adding a chromogenic substrate followed by a stop
solution. Plates were read at an optical density of 450 nm on a
BioTek Epoch plate reader. Samples were run in triplicate and
data pooled from each treatment group. Data represent the
means +
- S.E.M. from two independent biological replicates
analyzed in triplicate per time point.
Statistical analysis
For ELISA and QPCR, each experiment of cell stimula-
tion with bacteria was carried out two times in inde-
pendent experiments with triplicate replicants. Results are
presented as means +
- S.E.M. and were analyzed by Stu-
dent's t test. Differences in values are considered signifi-
cant at P < 0.05. P < 0.05 = ; P < 0.01 = **; P < 0.0005 = ***;
P < 0.0001 = ****. For QPCR, the values are normalized to the
negative control (medium alone) and shown as the fold num-
ber of the control's value.
RESULTS
Transcriptional profiling of chemokine and
receptor gene expression in human astrocytes
and HBMEC in response to B. burgdorferi
To begin to delineate the responses of human astrocytes
to B. burgdorferi, we stimulated primary cultures of nor-
mal human astrocytes or HBMEC with exponential phase
spirochetes for 6, 12, 24 or 72 h. At least two independent
stimulation experiments were performed per cell type, with
three replicates per experiment. After RNA extraction from
stimulated and control cells, cDNA was synthesized and used
as a template for commercial real-time PCR array analysis.

Commercial QPCR arrays were used to quantify the transcrip-
tion of a panel of human chemokines, chemokine-like genes,
and their receptors. Threshold cycle values across experi-
ments and between replicates were very reproducible, with
standard deviations averaging about 1 cycle across the array
(results not shown). Data were analyzed and fold changes
between control and treated samples using the manufac-
turer's software (SABiosciences), with a threshold of 3-fold
change in gene expression. For both astrocytes and HBMEC,
most of the transcriptional changes occurred early, at 6 h
post-stimulation. In the case of astrocytes, out of 84 genes
represented on the array, only eight genes (10.5%) were dif-
ferentially regulated with a fold change above 3 at 6 h. Genes
up-regulated more than 3-fold in all biological replicates at
6, 12, 24 or 72 h are shown in Table 2. Interestingly, very
few genes were down-regulated in response to B. burgdor-
feri stimulation. At 12 h, CCL11 (eosinophil chemoattractant
and CCL4 (NK (natural killer) cell and monocyte chemoat-
tractant) were down-regulated 6- and 3.2-fold, respectively.
At 24 h post-stimulation, the chemokine receptor CXCR (CXC
chemokine receptor)3 was down-regulated 4.3-fold, and at
72 h, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 was down-regulated
3-fold while the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 was down-
regulated 4.9-fold, in relation to unstimulated cultures. Sim-
ilarly, for primary endothelial cells, only a small fraction of
genes were differentially regulated at any time point exam-
ined (Table 3).
Validation of selected genes among those found
to be differentially regulated by QPCR array
analysis
The mRNA expression of selected genes (IL-8, CXCL-1, and
CXCL-10) was analyzed in kinetic experiments at 6, 12, 24,
and 72 h after Borrelia stimulation. Expression levels of all
transcripts were compared with housekeeping genes (-actin
or GAPDH) and the relative changes in gene expression were
compared with those of untreated cells using the 2- CT
method on each individual example with the untreated sam-
ple as the comparator. Results obtained after -actin and
GAPDH normalization were very similar to each other (re-
sults not shown). A similar trend in transcriptional induc-
tion was observed by QPCR and that seen in the commercial
real-time PCR arrays. For astrocytes, we confirmed strong
up-regulation of the genes encoding IL-8 and CXCL-1, with
highest transcription detected at 12 h, and CXCL-10,
with highest transcription detected at 24 h post-stimulation.
For HBMEC, transcription of IL-8, CXCL-1, and CXCL-10 all
peaked at 72 h.

astrocytes, we measured IL-8, CXCL-1, and CXCL-10 synthesis.
For astrocytes, chemokines IL-8 and CXCL-1 were secreted in
time-dependent manner, with peak secretion at 24 h after
cell stimulation compared with unstimulated control cells.
CXCL-10 expression, in contrast, was elevated as early as
6 h post-stimulation and remained relatively unchanged at
subsequent time points examined (Figure 2). Interestingly, al-
though B. burgdorferi viability in the presence of astrocytes
and cell culture medium decreased over time, heat-killed
bacteria were still able to induce a significant chemokine
response at 24 h (Supplementary Figure S1).

DISCUSSION
Chemokines and their receptors mediate trafficking of leuko-
cytes into the CNS in response to injury or infection. A key
feature associated with infection is disruption of the BBB,
leading to enhanced neutrophil extravasation into the CNS
(McColl et al., 2008). However, the contribution of brain mi-
crovasculature and glial inflammatory activity to the recruit-
ment of systemic, potentially neurotoxic, inflammatory cells
remains ill defined (Allen et al., 2012).
In this paper, we demonstrate that primary HBMEC and
primary human astrocytes express a variety of chemokines
and chemokine receptors in response to the spirochete,
B. burgdorferi. These chemokines may contribute to re-
cruitment of inflammatory cells and the onset and pro-
gression of neuronal damage leading to neuroborreliosis
(Allen et al., 2012). Indeed, non-human primate astrocytes
express the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 in response to
B. burgdorferi (Ramesh et al., 2009). In regards to human pa-
tients, IL-8 is found in the CSF of individuals with neurobor-
reliosis (Grygorczuk et al. 2004; Henningsson et al., 2011).
Although there are many potential sources of IL-8 in the
CSF, we demonstrate that this key neutrophil chemoattrac-
tant is also made by human astrocytes in response to B.
burgdorferi. In addition, we demonstrate that another neu-
trophil recruiting chemokine, CXCL-1, is also produced by
astrocytes. Astrocytes possess the receptor for CXCL-1, al-
lowing for an autocrine feedback loop that can prolong and
amplify inflammation in the CNS (Dorf et al., 2000).
The precise role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of Lyme
borreliosis is unclear. In the macaque model of the disease,
microglia are clearly involved in the early inflammation and
elaborate a number of cytokines and chemokines; however,

there is also significant evidence for astrocyte contribution to
the inflammatory response to B. burgdorferi, both in vivo and
in vitro (Ramesh et al. 2003; 2008; 2009). For example, pri-
mary rhesus macaque astrocytes stimulated with B. burgdor-
feri components elaborate both IL-6 and TNF, which lead
to astrocyte proliferation and apoptosis, respectively (Ramesh
et al., 2003). Interestingly, we also saw up-regulation of TNF
from human astrocytes in response to B. burgdorferi at 6 h
(Table 2); TNF is a potent inducer of inflammatory responses
and thus may serve to amplify the chemokine responses we
observed. There is also evidence for astrogliosis in human
neuroborreliosis, as evidenced by increased GFAP (glial fibril-
lary acidic protein) in the CSF of patients (Dotevall et al. 1996;
1999). These data suggest that in human patients, astrocyte
proliferation and activation occurs in response to the spiro-
chete, underlying the potential role of astrocytes in disease
progression.
Likewise, HBMEC probably contribute to chemokine re-
sponses and subsequent inflammation in neuroborreliosis.
Our results demonstrate that protein expression of both neu-
trophil chemoattractants CXCL-1 and IL-8 was strongly up-
regulated by HBMEC in response to B. burgdorferi. Stimula-
tion of endothelial cells from other anatomical sites with B.
burgdorferi resulted in both robust IL-8 transcription (Burns
et al., 1997), as well as CXCL-1 (Dame et al., 2007). In vitro, HB-
MEC stimulated with Streptococcus pneumoniae up-regulate
IL-8 and CXCL-1, suggesting the elaboration of neutrophil-
specific chemokines may be a common response to bacterial
insults at the BBB (Banerjee et al., 2010). In previous stud-
ies, transfected HBMEC incubated with B. burgdorferi did
not demonstrate up-regulation of cytokines or chemokines
at 5 h post-stimulation by ELISA, suggesting that HBMEC do
not store pre-formed chemokines and must synthesize these
attractants de novo upon exposure to B. burgdorferi (Grab

Astrocyte/endothelial response to Borrelia
et al., 2007). The role of endothelial cells in neuroborreliosis
has also been examined by observing spirochetal translo-
cation across single-cell monolayers of transformed HBMEC
(Grab et al. 2005; 2009). While these studies indicated a
role for host plasminogen and Ca2 + signaling in transloca-
tion, there is scarce published data on the contribution of
chemokines to the disruption of the BBB. However, the ex-
pression of inflammatory chemokines by the human BBB has
not been well characterized in vivo or in multi-cell mod-
els in vitro, highlighting the need for further investigation
(Holman et al., 2011).
The significance of increased expression of IL-8 and CXCL-
1 by brain endothelia and astrocytes lies in their role in neu-
trophil recruitment into the CNS (Johnson et al., 2011). IL-8
has been shown to act as an endothelial chemoattractant
for neutrophils and is directly involved with neutrophil mi-
gration on endothelial surfaces (Burns et al., 1997). Allen,
et al., (2012) have demonstrated recently that migration of
neutrophils through the neurovascular unit shifts the neu-
trophils to a neurotoxic phenotype resulting in increased re-
lease of proteases, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and
NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps). They demonstrated that
when neutrophils harvested immediately following CNS en-
dothelial transmigration were co-cultured with primary cor-
tical neurons, they induced significant neuronal loss within
30 min of application. Neutrophils that had not been ac-
tivated by CNS endothelial transmigration demonstrate no
neurotoxicity. Others have shown that co-culture of acti-
vated neutrophils with primary hippocampal neurons (Dinkel
et al., 2004) or dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons
(Shaw et al., 2008) also resulted in massive neuronal loss.
Thus, the B. burgdorferi-induced elaboration of IL-8 and
CXCL-1 by astrocytes and HBMEC probably contribute to
the neural damage associated with neuroborreliosis through
recruitment of neurotoxic neutrophils.
CXCL-10, a chemokine important for T-cell accumula-
tion, was also significantly up-regulated in B. burgdorferi-
stimulated astrocytes and HBMEC. High levels of CXCL-10
are observed in the CNS of humans with neuroborreliosis
(Henningsson et al., 2011). Indeed, it has been postulated
that CXCL-10 creates a chemokine gradient between the CSF
and serum and recruits CD4 + T-cells into the CSF of patients
with neuroborreliosis (Lepej et al., 2005). CXCL-10 plays an
important role in other CNS infections, and is one of the
most highly expressed chemokines in response to West Nile
Virus (Lim and Murphy, 2011). Interestingly, CXCL-10 and its
receptor CXCR3 are expressed by neurons (Lim et al., 2011).
We did not observe up-regulation of CXCR3 on astrocytes
(results not shown); suggesting that, in vivo, neurons may
be the primary cell type responding to this chemokine. In-
deed, neuronal apoptosis is mediated by increased expression
of CXCL-10 in response to a variety of infectious insults in-
cluding simian HIV encephalitis (Sui et al., 2006). Clearly,
the crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes in CNS in-
fections is key to determining the ultimate outcome of the
disease.
The fact that very few chemokines and related genes
changed in response to stimulation with B. burgdorferi was
unexpected. However, these data make sense in the context
of a spirochetal pathogen. These organisms have a repu-
tation for `stealth' and persistence even in immunocompe-
tent hosts. While possessing a number of pathogen asso-
ciated molecular patterns and inflammatory stimulants like
lipoproteins, B. burgdorferi lacks LPS (lipopolysaccharide) in
its outer membranes. Therefore B. burgdorferi's effects on
glia and other supporting cells such as HBMEC, may be more
subtle than that observed in acute, severe infections of the
CNS.
Together these data and that presented herein show that
B. burgdorferi can stimulate up-regulation of chemokines
from brain microvascular endothelia and astrocytes, which
potentiate entry of neurotoxic neutrophils into the brain.
Such an event can lead to neuronal loss and may contribute to
the cognitive impairments and other neurological deficits as-
sociated with neuroborreliosis. This is the first study to inves-
tigate comprehensively the chemokine-centered responses of
primary human astrocytes and HBMEC to B. burgdorferi. Un-
derstanding the contributions of individual glia cell types to
the damage induced by B. burgdorferi will ultimately allow
for the development of targeted, cell type-specific interven-
tions and therapies.
