Introduction
This article explores the processes by which a specific form of
new content is generated. The form is comedy, as represented
by the joke. Two intermingled themes dominate this explora-
tion: comedians' need for their jokes to be recognized as their
own personal (or authentic) creations, and the media environ-
ment in which the production of comedy is shaped. Omid
Djalili's comment on his own performance "This shit doesn't
write itself" (Nottingham Playhouse, February 20, 2012)
introduces the topic very effectively. If comedy doesn't write
itself, where does it come from? Freud was interested in pre-
cisely this question. He remarks that "The great majority of
jokes . . . are circulated anonymously; one would be curious to
learn from what sort of people such productions originate"
(Freud, 1905/2002, p. 193). This was precisely the source of
the author's own interest in the question when on the school
playground in the 1950s he heard jokes that had clearly been
given an elaborate structure by someone who fully understood
how to contrive something that used conventional comic tech-
nique to prompt laughter. At the same time, they were of such
infantile stupidity and filthiness that it was impossible to
believe that they had ever been intended to appear in print or
be performed in front of a paying audience, live or broadcast.
Both Freud and the author were essentially asking their ques-
tion in a pre-mass communication environment when most
jokes were normally an anonymous oral phenomenon.
Freud (1905/2002) is still probably the most quoted author-
ity on the nature of the joke itself. In his second chapter, on
The Technique of Jokes, he discusses them as a combination
of [comic] technique and [humorous] thought. The thought is
a perception of something anomalous whether in language
(the sort of verbal coincidence that makes a pun), human
behavior (someone's quirks or tics), beliefs, relationships,
political and social circumstances, culture both high and low,
religion, and science. The comic technique is the presentation
of this perception in a way that points up what the comedian
identifies as its humorous qualities. The technique is most
commonly structural and verbal, although comedians empha-
size and illustrate their jokes with facial expressions and their
body language. Even the most inspired and best structured
joke is usually most effective when delivered with the judg-
ment and timing of a practiced comedian and when emerging
convincingly from a natural or well realized comic persona.
What Freud said in 1905 holds true even today.
The second half of the 20th century and the beginning of
the 21st has become the era of the stand-up comedian (a per-
former who literally stands in front of an audience to deliver
comic material). In this era it is possible to uncover much
more about the creation of comic content than is true of ear-
lier periods. In the United Kingdom particularly, and else-
where to a significant but lesser extent, there is an enormous
output of comedy in a range of different communication

The Production of Comedy: The Joke in
the Age of Social Media
Paul Sturges1
Abstract
The joke is an essential comic format, and since great volumes of jokes circulate unattributed and without explicit context,
the question of their origin requires answering. The current production of jokes is explored in this article, using interviews
with stand-up comedians and the current literature of comedy. Comedians reveal a serious devotion to their joke writing,
spending working time trawling their own experience and cultural exposure for potentially comic material which they then
can structure as jokes. In carrying out this task, they are strongly concerned that the material they create will represent a
message that is true to themselves (or "authentic") rather than merely amusing. They use social media to test material and
build their profile with potential audiences. In doing so, they accept the collateral effect that their jokes will quickly enter the
communally owned resource of comic content that circulates orally and electronically.

formats. Much of this is created by the stand-up comedians
who perform it. It is not especially difficult to obtain insights
into the creative processes of stand-up comedy. Many of the
current creators of comedy are very self-conscious and open
about this. Twenty-first century comedians would like to
think that their jokes are correctly attributed to them and that
their professional skills and abilities are properly understood.
Jokes still circulate unattributed, with the Internet as chief
medium for this. But the nature of the medium often permits
anyone who is sufficiently interested to trace them back to a
specific creator. An effect of this is that writers can now be
more effectively judged as artists who make authentic per-
sonal statements through their comedy. What follows will
explore the outpouring of new comic content, as far as pos-
sible through the words of comedians themselves, with the
themes of media influences and authenticity as the main foci.
Methodology and Literature
The method adopted here is to develop a narrative in the
manner usual in historical and literary studies. Use is made
of original testimony derived from the author's ongoing pro-
gram of interviews with comedians, earlier examples of
which provided the evidence for a previous article (Sturges,
2010). In what follows, the date and location of an interview
is given on its first use in the text, but not subsequently.
Effectively, a small number of interviews and conversations
is used to suggest something about the activity of a large
community of performers. An estimate would suggest that
Britain has hundreds, maybe thousands, of professional
comedians constituting a higher number per capita than any
other country, including the United States. To place this in
proportion, the 5 million Danes support as few as 20 to 30
full-time comedians (Russell, 2013). Making a clear distinc-
tion between stand-up comedians and comic performers of
theatre plays and films or radio and TV series and sketch
shows is not possible. There is too much overlap. However,
the main focus here is on individual comic performance
rather than scripted sketch and full-length drama comedy on
stage, radio, TV, and movies. We should, however, note that
stand-up comedy routines are also recorded and broadcast on
radio and TV and sold as videos.
In addition to interview material, much of the argument
developed here is based on a reading of selected titles from
the literature of comedy. Naturally using the literature begins
with the essential insights provided by the scholarly classics.
Freud (1905/2002) has already been cited and there is
Bakhtin's (1968) analysis of carnival and Legman's (1968)
tireless cataloguing of, and commentary on, the dirty joke.
More recently, the literature of comedy has grown swiftly.
Works by Moreall (1983), Palmer (1994), Jacobson (1997),
and Lockyer and Pickering (2005) are worth mentioning as
providing particularly relevant context. Henkle (1980) sets
English popular comedy in a cultural context, as does
Medhurst (2007) who draws on a rich selection from the
wealth of recent commentary. Specifically on the joke, Holt's
(2008) elegant essay illustrates the form very effectively. A
working comedian's thoughts on the subject can be found in
Carr and Greeves (2006). This is very definitely not a schol-
arly work, and indeed much of the source material for a study
such as the present one is popular in intent rather than schol-
arly. Thus, there are relevant general accounts of comedy
during the period from Nathan (1971) and Fisher (1973).
There is an account of a pioneering scriptwriting collective
from McCann (2006); many textbooks on scriptwriting such
as Wolfe (1992); and others on performance, of which
Ritchie (2012) is a recent example. The outstanding contri-
bution to this literature, however, is the remarkably candid
and informative commentary on stand-up comedy of the per-
former and writer Stewart Lee (2010). What Lee does is to
annotate transcripts of his own live comedy performances
with a dense body of comments, explanations, confessions,
challenges, and additional comic content. His contribution to
the literature of stand-up comedy, and comedy in general, is
a landmark.
Comedy and Broadcast Media
Before examining the current mode of production of com-
edy, it is necessary to look back at the immediate past. The
past 70 years has seen the mutation of comedy from an art or
entertainment performed entirely to live audiences to a form
also disseminated by mass media and now, in particular, by
social media. This process of change took place in the mid-
20th century. In the 19th century, comedians were heard in
the music halls: performance spaces known for their vulgar-
ity and vitality and found all over Britain. Vaudeville was
probably the closest American equivalent. Music hall
declined and died away in the early 20th century, with vari-
ety theatre providing a new outlet for comedy. Variety in turn
declined, but this time in competition with the early manifes-
tations of broadcasting in the second half of the century. Live
comedy in the United Kingdom largely retreated to the
northern workingmen's club circuit. As will be explained
later, the comedy of the clubs was generally considered
unsuitable for media dissemination. Mid-century radio and
TV essentially incorporated the blander and more acceptable
content that characterized the variety tradition into sketch
shows and situation comedy. With the exception of the clubs,
comedy writing and performance continued to be driven by
broadcast media until social media and a new comedy club
circuit stimulated the fresh waves of comedy that are the sub-
ject of this article.
It is more or less a cliché that before mass media a come-
dian could build a long and successful career with little more
material than was needed for a single performance, which
could be presented in front of different audiences up and
down the country. It might be a cliché, but the evidence sug-
gests that it is essentially true. George Robey, 1869-1954,
known as the Prime Minister of Mirth, was so preeminent in
Sturges 3
the musical hall days that detailed commentary on his comic
style and content has survived to be collated, for instance by
Harding (1990). What becomes immediately obvious is that
Robey did not depend on the strength of his jokes: It was his
comic persona, his mode of delivery, and his songs, linked by
comic patter, that were the source of his success. Audiences
regarded this patter as sublimely funny and it is here that we
might expect to find jokes. However, to the modern reader,
transcripts of his material contain hardly any. He interacted
with the audience through poses, gestures, facial expres-
sions, and indignant accusations that they were reading unin-
tended meanings into what he said.
A very different set of demands began to apply in com-
edy in the 1940s and 1950s. After the foundation of the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 1923, variety, as
an entertainment form, transferred to radio more or less
intact. The strains this created for comedians were apparent
from the beginning, with an official view from the BBC in
1931 being that "few comedians are capable of writing their
own material and the dearth of clever humorous writers is
even greater" (Parker, 1977, p. 41). Comedy was neverthe-
less successful in radio. During the 1939-1945 War, comedy
programs, most notably It's That Man Again (frequently
referred to as ITMA), were scheduled almost every evening.
The extent to which the catchphrases of broadcast comedi-
ans became part of the currency of everyday conversation
shows how popular comedy was, and why it was regarded as
an important contribution to national morale. The mass taste
for radio comedy that had been nurtured in war time meant
that in the post-war years, there was a continuing need for
new comic output. Some of the response was predictable,
drawing on the undemanding merriment, catchphrases,
wordplay, and stereotypical characters already popular. This
material was fed into half hour shows, or slots in longer
radio variety programs, and used sketches, conversations,
and monologues to deliver a flow of jokes.
Some of the material was developed by the performers
themselves, but some was from writers who provided mate-
rial of differing levels of quantity and quality. Thus Bob
Monkhouse began his career in comedy as a teenager in
1945, selling pages of his jokes to comedians for a few shil-
lings at theatre stage doors (Monkhouse, 1993).
The career of Frankie Howerd exemplifies the struggles
of a great performer who was not himself a writer. During his
short first radio season in 1946, he effectively used up the
entire resources of material that he had been touring around
variety theatres for years. At first his response was "studying
a pile of joke books, cannibalising their contents and then
inserting enough stutters, hesitations and digressions to
ensure that every single joke could be relied on to go a long,
long way" (McCann, 2004, p. 80) Eventually Howerd's
improvised research proved inadequate for his needs and in
November 1947 he hired Eric Sykes to write for him. Howerd
understood his debt to Sykes and those who wrote for him
subsequently. "When it came to writers, he knew that no
other comedian in the country had shown them, both as indi-
viduals and as members of a profession, so much trust,
respect and support" (McCann, 2004, p. 163). Howerd and
his writers later successfully adapted to television. BBC
Television, which had a tentative beginning before the war,
began to broadcast in earnest after the end of hostilities, but
did not become a significant vehicle for comedy until the
1950s.
What was distinctive about the early years of mass media,
compared with the previous age of live performance, was
that the creation of comedy became a major aspect of per-
formers'work, and indeed the whole profession of the script-
writers who served them. This theme of comedy writing as
work has become even more significant in the period as
stand-up comedy has become the dominant mode. What has
changed in the age of stand-up comedy is that the balance has
shifted toward a concept of the comedian as a kind of auteur.
There is thus a tension that will be apparent in the following
sections between the creation of jokes as a form of artistic
endeavor and as an occupation serving the demand for nov-
elty of mass media audiences. The contemporaneous devel-
opment and growth of social media has both raised levels of
demand and permitted the comedian to interact with audi-
ences in a way that offers unprecedented reach and speed.
The Joke in Stand-Up Comedy
Probably the dominant theme of commentary on comedy
today is the search for what we will call "authenticity." An
overarching idea of what authenticity might mean emerged
in its British version with the "alternative comedy" of Alexei
Sayle, Jo Brand, Ben Elton, and others in the 1980s. It was
first heard in London's Comedy Store, and it still dominates
the content of routines heard in venues up and down the
country. If it was alternative to anything, that was to the two
comic traditions that emerged from music hall and variety.
These were light comedy, as broadcast on mainstream radio
and TV and as performed on stage, and the comedy of the
northern workingmen's clubs. The former set out to amuse
but not challenge. The latter tapped into a coarser, crueler
strain of comedy in which there is a kind of disgust for the
body and its functions, and women and all kinds of minori-
ties might be insulted and demeaned. It was perhaps for the
workingmen's clubs that the coarse and ugly jokes of the
1950s playground had been created. This form of comedy
was seldom if ever broadcast in unexpurgated form, although
a few comedians such as Bernard Manning and Roy
"Chubby" Brown built careers that partially lapped over into
the media world from the grubby, male-dominated live ven-
ues of the north of England. Commentators generally draw
attention to alternative comedy's rejection of political and
social establishments in favor of human values, the honest
way it embraced even the most taboo of subject matter, and
its angry, expletive-laden voice. It is personal comedy cre-
ated in this spirit that we mean when we talk of authenticity.
4 SAGE Open
But we use the term in a rather broader sense to cover the
comedian's ownership of both content (Freud's "thought")
and expression (Freud's "technique"). In this article, authen-
ticity refers much more to jokes that reveal a personal voice
than it does to jokes that embody a social critique.
When we talk of the work of creating comedy and the
artistic pressures, we also need to talk of the incentives and
rewards. Audiences noisily express their intolerance of stale
andfamiliarmaterial.AccordingtoBethanyBlack(Interview,
Manchester, November 28, 2011), a few comedians do still
behave as if they were in the music hall age and tour what is
basically a single set or routine round small venues season
after season. However good this set might be, the lack of new
material means that they have no genuine prospect of break-
ing through into the world of radio, TV, stadium gigs, and
DVDs. All of these demand novelty. At this point, it is impor-
tant to stress that although the payment offered for a 20-min
slot in a small comedy club might scarcely cover the expenses
incurred in travelling there, in contrast, the financial rewards
of success are enormous. A few very successful comedians
such as Peter Kay, Jimmy Carr, and Michael McIntyre earn
annual sums measured in millions. The basis for this level of
success usually involves a regular TV spot, corporate enter-
tainment gigs, tours of major theatres and even stadiums,
DVDs of live performances, book contracts, voice-over
work, and other peripherals. Even just a smaller impact in
some of these forms can represent a comfortable middle-
class income level. Comedians who care both about the qual-
ity and integrity of their material and hope for major success
effectively commit themselves to produce great numbers of
new jokes each year. This is impossible without both skill
and application, but working with social media does facili-
tate the process in ways that will be illustrated.
The Tension Between Effort and
Authenticity
Comedy writing is characterized very effectively by Schneider
(2009):
It takes a lot of work to make a good joke. I know it's not work
in the sense of a seven-year old child down an Angolan tin mine,
but I also know some jokes just pop out spontaneously. But more
often than not, the birth of a joke is a long, painful process,
without gas and air, or epidural (p. 3).
Ritchie (2012, p. 157) quotes John Cleese as saying that it
might take him and Graham Chapman 2 hr to generate 2 min
of material. Bethany Black describes similar levels of work.
Using her own life and observations as her main sources, she
sometimes finds readymade jokes emerge. Her experience is
that these tend not to be as good as those that require work
(for instance to set them in character). She aims to devote at
least 3 hr per day to writing and tests material via social
media, reckoning that about 20 favorable responses indicate
that a joke will work. A comedian such as Gary Delaney
(Interview, Derby, October 18, 2010) whose material con-
sists of those tiny comic units we call "one liners" has to
generate enormous numbers of jokes. Delaney records them
on his phone as they occur to him. He calculates that only
about 1 in 20 is worth persisting with for his own routines
(though he may use the best of the rest in scripts for other
comedians).
The nature of this persistence, which turns a comic idea
into a well-formed joke, naturally varies from comedian to
comedian. Lee (2010) suggests that "even though critics and
TV Commissioners always talk about our art form in terms
of its content, it is the rhythm, pitch, tone and pace of what
we do--the non-verbal cues--that are arguably more impor-
tant" (p. 299). So we can envisage the work as first identify-
ing or creating content and then giving that content the form
in which it can be performed successfully. Bethany Black
identifies a threefold formula--[writing] skills, turnover [of
content], and a Unique Selling Point [or comic persona]--
which provides for this. Turnover might merely be based on
the resolution to create fresh material, but skills include both
the writing of jokes and embedding them in a persona. The
persona tends to be presented to an audience as if it is a truth-
ful representation of the comedian's attitudes, beliefs, behav-
ior, but in fact it is always more or less artificial. Stewart Lee
(2010) puts it in the following way: "The personal is absent
from my work. The me you see on stage is largely a con-
struct, based on me at my worst, my most annoying, my most
petty and my most patronizing" (p. 249). Despite what he
says, this is, of course, intensely personal and, indeed,
authentic even if it only represents part of his personality and
part of his natural voice.
Lee, always the most trenchant of commentators, calls
those performers whose comedy is written for them as
"cheats." For the comedian to avoid being a cheat, in Lee's
terms, is not an easy assignment. It is important to emphasize
the point that this represents a break with the past. Griffin
(2005) says of Ken Dodd, the great survivor of the old-
school, that he does not reveal himself in his comedy.
This point of view is one of the schisms between comics of the
old and newer schools. The younger breed clearly thinks that
comedy has to be about something and to say something about
the comedian; the old pros of Dodd's generation think the
opposite is true. Funny is funny: no more no less. (p. 201)
Nowadays, there is a core audience, a body of critics, and a
community of fellow writers and performers that does not
share Dodd's view. This community demands that comedi-
ans should not merely deliver highly polished new content,
but also speak with their own personal voice.
New comedy is expected to avoid the familiar themes
(mother-in-law jokes, racial stereotyping, etc.) of the pre-
stand-up era, but where can the comedian look for inspira-
tion? The idea, sometimes expressed, that only the experience
Sturges 5
of conflict and the awareness of death produce great comedy
is unhelpful, given that most British and American comedi-
ans have enjoyed comparatively trouble free lives. A few
comedians, who have grown up in harder circumstances, do
have experience that offers insight into the extremes. Zoe
Lyons (Interview, Derby, May 14, 2008) has interesting
things to say about the caution with which she exposes her
own experience as a gay woman to public view. Bethany
Black does not shrink from developing comedy as a trans-
gendered lesbian woman. For the majority of comedians,
there is a choice of big social and political themes and the
exploration of daily and domestic experience. Many of them
avoid the big themes and risk banality in the small scale and
personal. An alert comedian observes the daily life with an
eye for the bizarre. Delaney's starting point could be a cliché,
a neologism, something heard on the radio (particularly late
night talk shows), song lyrics, or other "found" material.
Black might see the unintended comedy in an overheard con-
versation or the "inspirational" statements people place on
Facebook. Comedians also structure jokes around phrases
and jingles from familiar advertisements or popular TV
shows. This is material requiring transmutation from its
essential triviality. Twisting and manipulating it into viable
joke form is work, and the effectiveness of that work needs
to be tested.
Testing New Comedy and Social Media
Much of the testing of new material today is no different
from what it might have been in the 19th and 20th centuries.
It is done in small venues where quite well-known comedi-
ans will perform work in progress to small audiences for a
negligible fee. Sarah Millican (Interview, Derby, January 21,
2008) follows a personal rule that if material she tests on an
audience succeeds on three out of five occasions, it is strong
enough to take its place in her regular live routines. What is
distinctive about the current age of comedy is that social
media now offer a powerful alternative to this process.
Exposing new jokes via social media has two values--it is
both an invaluable testing ground for material and a means of
building up a profile with a potential audience. Delaney
acquired 12,000 Twitter followers in 18 months and was able
to track about 25% of ticket sales for his 2010 Edinburgh run
to this following. He finds that using Twitter (not Facebook
which has too static an "audience") works better than just
sitting in front of a screen or a sheet of paper. However, there
are two downsides to this. Delaney calculates that if one of
his jokes gets so re-posted that it goes viral, within little more
than 24 hr it is circulating without attribution. After 72 hr
audiences can be heard commenting "that just an old pub
joke," rendering good material almost unusable. However,
some material transcends this and works despite the familiar-
ity. He hopes to make an audio CD of this "evolution-tested"
material as a kind of heritage of his comedy.
The second downside to exposing new material on social
media is that other comedians may appropriate the jokes.
This is a common occurrence which occasionally surfaces
publicly: Delaney, Tim Vine, Marcus Brigstocke, Phil
Jupitus, and others have discussed this (Schneider, 2009).
Their response varies from largely impotent anger expressed
via the networks and in the media but also, more directly,
protests directed at audience members who appear to be
recording their act. This is not new and the author well
remembers the late Mike Reid at a private club performance
in the early 1970s refusing to continue while an audience
member made notes. At the other end of the spectrum of
responses, there is a resigned acceptance that this "borrow-
ing" is just an incentive to make their own comedy unique
and less likely to be passed off as someone else's. This is a
problem. Originality is hard to achieve precisely because
jokes take standard forms, and because they circle around
familiar topics. The comedians of the past did not worry too
much: the familiarity of much of their material might well
have been reassuring for audiences. They were naturally bor-
rowers, purchasers, and recyclers of jokes. If they used
someone else's joke, audiences would probably not notice,
or maybe even relish its familiarity. As we have already
pointed out, here were many willing sellers of jokes, and
published jokes and other comic material could provide ideas
and inspiration. The comedian as researcher is not a com-
pletely unknown phenomenon and Ken Dodd, for instance,
is both a great archivist of comic material and an enthusiastic
user of libraries (Conversation after performance at Derby,
June 5, 2010). Today, the competitiveness of the comedy
world and the media exposure of new jokes make the ques-
tion of originality a more urgent concern.
The ultimate intention is to create a complete comic rou-
tine from newly-written jokes (and carefully prepared impro-
visations). This requires a further input of hard work. Stewart
Lee creates what he calls "Epic shows full of call backs and
cross references or supporting shifts of mood or emotional
gambits" (Lee, 2010, p. 95) that rely on a narrative or con-
ceptual through line. It is something akin to this that a come-
dian must create to have any hope of more than just small
venue exposure. The testing ground is likely to be a month's
residency at the Edinburgh Festival in August of the year. It
is here that critical attention and the chance of high-profile
bookings can be generated. Edinburgh comedy shows are
expected to last for an hour, which means that a comedian's
normal 20 min set will need to be replaced or expanded into
something much more like one of Lee's epics. The extra
work this demands is obvious, but a comedian's profession-
alism points in this way already. Black believes that the life
cycle of any comedy set, short or long, should be no more
than 6 months. This means that while touring one set, another
must be in preparation.
For the comedian who performs one-liners, the demands
are very much greater. Gary Delaney, one of the outstanding
one-liner comedians, knows his material works best in a
6 SAGE Open
20-min format, describes the structuring of an hour-long
Edinburgh set. He aims to give the material an upward trajec-
tory, starting gently before introducing a more shocking
theme or a mini-narrative. He will package different parts of
the set with contrasting "voices." Occasional songs or bits of
stage business can be used as punctuation between the parts.
The aim is to create rises and troughs, light and shade, with
some fixed and some floating breakpoints to avoid the flag-
ging of audience attention. Yet at the same time as he subtly
shapes his material, he employs total openness, telling the
audience that "these are just jokes and some are in bad taste."
The elaborate artifice of his Edinburgh-length routine is con-
siderable even though the consistent tone of his personal
voice is always apparent. The virtue of a fully realized rou-
tine suitable for presentation at Edinburgh is that if it is good
enough, it can be used for a tour of major venues and an
eventual commercially available DVD.
Concluding Remarks
There is, in Britain and the United States and to a lesser
extent in other countries, a content producing community
that creates the thousands of small, often ephemeral, works
of commentary on human life that we call jokes. We have
illustrated how in response to the demands of mass media
the writing of jokes became a painstaking professional pro-
cess, despite the process's essential playfulness. The pos-
sibilities presented by social media now, in turn, allowed
comedians to engage with an extensive public, not limited
by presence at a specific venue, while their work is in the
process of creation. Social media are both an outlet for con-
tent and a stimulus for fresh production. Services such as
Facebook and Twitter disseminate content at a rate which,
given the requirement for novelty in comedy first noted by
Freud, might seem to threaten to exhaust the production
capacity. Indeed, critics periodically speculate that the
resources are becoming exhausted and that new comedy is
no longer of the same quality as before. It is reasonable to
suggest that the demand for authenticity, which comedians
and critics impose on the task of writing comedy, actually
contributes strongly to more and better quality comic mate-
rial. Certainly, the production capacity seems to respond
with fresh material constantly appearing from both new and
established writers and performers.
On every night of every year, comedians try out new
material which they themselves have created in their own
authentic voice in pubs, clubs, and small theatres, but cru-
cially this is only part of the story. The extent to which this
material has already withstood the test of exposure via social
media makes it possible to suggest that the media environ-
ment itself is a kind of engine for stimulating new comedy.
This might make it sound as though ideas plus social media
equals jokes. This is far from the case. Whether a comedian
explores the most problematic recesses of human behavior,
as does Lee, or generates inspired wordplay, like Delaney, it
is expected that there will be an underlying truth and coher-
ence to the material. Comedians who are seen to be giving
something of themselves are valued more highly than those
who just seek to amuse. The comedian in the age of social
media is both an artist and a technician employing a range of
creative and communication skills to produce new jokes with
the flavor of authenticity. Some of the new material that they
create is rubbish: some is gold. Today this distinction can
emerge fast and decisively. Social media are both a challenge
and a stimulus for the comedian. There is only one consistent
feature between the pre-media age, the age of broadcasting,
and the current age of social media. This is that someone
somewhere is exploring their own responses to life and pol-
ishing this into new jokes that can be offered up to audiences.
Style, scale, and media vary, but the joke remains.

Author Biography
Paul Sturges has written extensively on Intellectual Freedom top-
ics, and became interested in comedy as a mode of free expression.
His programme of interviewing standup comedians pointed him
towards the question of how jokes are created.
