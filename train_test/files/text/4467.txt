Introduction
Full-day kindergarten is becoming the norm in elementary
schools across the country. In fact, many education experts
are now calling kindergarten the 13th year of school for U.S.
students. Many states offer both full-day and half-day kin-
dergarten, with the trend leading toward the full-day sched-
ule. Only 8 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and
the Virgin Islands have a compulsory school age of 5 that
effectively, if not explicitly, mandates kindergarten atten-
dance for all children. Compulsory attendance ages in other
states range from age 6 to 8. Forty-two states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands mandate that
school districts offer at least half-day of kindergarten pro-
grams; however, only fourteen of those states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands mandate that
age-eligible children attend at least a half-day of kinder-
garten. Of the 14 states, only 9 states mandate that school
districts offer full-day kindergarten programs and only 2 of
those 9 states mandate that age-eligible children attend full-
day kindergarten (Kauerz, 2005).
As more states move toward a full-day kindergarten, the
question of funding arises, "Who will pay?" Many states
offer incentives to districts to offer full-day kindergarten
while other states provide a disincentive. The majority of the
states, 21 including the District of Columbia, provide no
clear incentive or disincentive for districts to offer full-day
kindergarten (Kauerz & McMaken, 2003). However, in some
instances where districts offer traditional half-day kindergar-
ten, parents are willing to pay the difference to enable dis-
tricts to provide a full-day program.
From East to West, promises of full-day kindergarten,
addition of extra classrooms, the search for highly qualified
teachers, and extra work absorbed by school committees con-
cerned about funding are on the rise, while stating that in
doing so, we will ensure the future academic success of our
next generation. In contrast, research does not support this
finding, but has identified a variety of factors that have con-
tributed to this national trend. With the increasing pressure of
school accountability and rigorous content standards imposed
by No Child Left Behind (NCLB), educators have responded.
Background of the Study
With a call for accountability, many states are documenting
the success or failure of their educational programs as they
compete for funding. In 2001, President Bush's education
reform act, NCLB, was a solution for helping our nations

Full-Day Kindergarten Effects on Later
Academic Success
Charles Milligan1
Abstract
The purpose of this research was to investigate full-day kindergarten, as a means of improving later academic achievement.
A total of 208 students who had continuous enrollment for three consecutive school years from a school district in
southern California participated in the study.The sample contained 165 students who had attended the traditional half-day
kindergarten program with 43 attending a hybrid all-day kindergarten program.All students were administered the California
Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) assessment and the California Achievement Test 6th Edition (CAT 6) survey
exams. Using stepwise multiple regression, several independent variables were introduced into the regression equation to
obtain a Prediction Model of Student Success.The English language arts and math scores of the California STAR Assessment
were used as the dependent variable separately.A significant model was not developed. Using an independent-sample T Test
procedure, comparing the two groups, was also preformed revealing that there were no significant differences in students
who attended the all-day kindergarten program and students who attended a traditional kindergarten program.

neediest children based on accountability, choice, and flexi-
bility in federal education programs (Bush, 2001). As a
direct result of NCLB, high-stake state assessments are now
used to bring about curriculum and pedagogical change at an
alarming pace. NCLB expects a high level of accountability
from each state in specified areas. While K-12 education
struggles to respond and demonstrate improvement, many
kindergarten programs are either not evaluated or are mea-
sured with limited assessments and lack of consistency.
Many states are implementing full-day kindergarten as a
"knee-jerk" reaction to NCLB without support from norma-
tive data and without changes in curriculum and teaching
methods. Some states have gone so far as to mandate kinder-
garten content standards in all academic areas, while kinder-
garten remains to be a noncompulsory grade.
Statement of Problem
School districts nationwide are attempting to meet the
demands of NCLB by implementing full-day kindergarten,
presuming that it will provide increased academic success
and a rise in test scores for students in future grades. The
implementation of full-day kindergarten is well received
with minor exception, yet it is not mandated, funded, nor
statistically proven to increase academic achievement for the
general population of students.
Purpose
The purpose of this research is to provide longitudinal
empirical data, to support or refute the body of research
available for policy makers to either modify or continue
their current kindergarten programs.
Importance of Study/Significance
of the Problem
With no sound evidence that full-day kindergarten provides
academic success for students in future grades, many districts
would save millions of dollars in kindergarten programs.

at the second grade. It is, therefore, important for districts to
determine the effectiveness in measured achievement as soon
as practicable in an age of diminishing budgets.
Research Questions
The following research questions will guide this study:
Research Question 1: Will measurable achievement of
second-grade students, who attended full-day kinder-
garten programs, display an increase in standardized
scores when compared with their half-day peers?
Research Question 2: When considering the varied
population of kindergarten students, which students
will realize greater academic achievement in later
grades?
Research Question 3: Will standardized test scores of
second graders validate funding for full-day kinder-
garten programs?
Assumptions
One assumption is that all students in this study were instructed
properly. It is assumed that the students have been performing
on or near grade level throughout first and second grade. In
addition, it is assumed that students considered at risk have
been identified, referred to student assistant teams for review,
and screened for learning disabilities, physical disabilities,
environmental damage, or developmental delays.
Historical Overview
Invented by Friedrich Froebel in 1830, kindergarten was cre-
ated to teach young students about art, design, mathematics,
and natural history. Throughout theAustro-Hungarian Empire,
kindergarten had become an intricate part of compulsory edu-
cation for students less than 6 years of age and by 1909,
Vienna had more than 72 kindergartens (Watson, 1997).
In 1840, kindergarten was first introduced but not until
1876 did it catch the eye of the American public (Watson,
1997). From that time and well in the 21st century, many
laws were enacted, changed, and revoked before California
established specific laws for kindergarten within its school
system.
In 1890, an amendment was called to action by the Los
Angeles School Board to establish and maintain kindergarten
schools. In that same year, several charity kindergartens were
taken over by the board and five new kindergartens were
added to existing primary schools (de Cos, 2001). Previously,
children as young as 2 or 3 had been permitted into the private
kindergartens. With this no longer available, day nurseries,
now known as preschools, were formed. Two years later, in
1893, a law was passed that kindergarten could be established
as part of the primary education system and school boards
were to use school funds for that purpose (de Cos, 2001).
Now part of primary education, kindergarten became a means
for children to receive necessary socialization and begin the
transition from living at home to attending primary school,
gradually adjusting to the academic rigors. During this period
of time, the philosophy of kindergarten continued to focus on
a child-centered approach, learning art, design, mathematics,
and natural history rather than structured academic lessons
teaching the Three R's (de Cos, 2001).
Funding for the public kindergartens became an ongoing
issue for school districts and the state. School boards could
not see enough evidence of the benefits of kindergarten to
support the heavy costs of small teacher to pupil ratio, expen-
sive materials, and half-day classes. In 1905, the California
Supreme Court ruled that kindergartens were no longer to be
Milligan 3
considered as part of the common educational system.
Because of this rule, state funding was no longer available to
support kindergarten programs. However, the court did state
that cities could support kindergarten programs as part of
their primary schools with the condition that the funding
came from other sources than the state. For the next 40 years,
funding would be a constant battle in the legislation until
1946 when an amendment to the state constitution provided
state aid. In addition, they also allowed attendance credit for
the kindergarten programs. Not until 21 years later, in 1967,
did the legislature mandate that districts incorporate kinder-
garten programs into their elementary schools making it
available to all eligible children (de Cos, 2001).
Kindergarten in the early 1900s was not valued by the
middle classes as it emphasized the importance of a trained
instructor rather than the mother in training of a child,
although this same group found it acceptable for immigrant
children and the impoverished children of the slums. With
kindergarten no longer operated privately but now funded by
school districts and freely available to all, advocates for kin-
dergarten education suggested that these children would
greatly benefit. They believed that "proper education" would
help to illuminate urban poverty. Furthermore, that by saving
these children from the "irrevocable stamp of the slum" by
instilling proper habits and virtue, these immigrant and
impoverished children would not propagate a generation of
poverty and crime (Watson, 1997).
Literature Review
Preventing Early School Failure, a study conducted in the
1970s and 1980s was one of the first attempts to provide
evidence that full-day kindergarten was academically bene-
ficial for all students (Karweit, Slavin, & Wasik, 1993). The
research reported mixed results, yet consistent evidence
regarding socioeconomic status (SES) and/or educationally
disadvantaged students exhibited positive academic and
social benefits (Burriss, 2000). Literature provides many
studies throughout the 1990s furnishing evidence of the
effectiveness of full-day kindergarten versus traditional half-
day kindergarten discovering that the most benefit is gained
by the SES, English language learner (ELL), and economi-
cally disadvantaged students. Although a study conducted in
1996 of 19 at-risk students displayed no significant differ-
ence in academic achievement, the conclusions state that
further research with a larger sample was necessary and the
results could not be applied to the general population.
Research evidence implies that full-day kindergarten
offers longer lasting academic benefits for children from
low-income families or others with fewer educational
resources prior to kindergarten (Elicker, 2000). Researchers
noted that by adding full-day kindergarten, the achievement
gap narrows between children from different racial and eth-
nic backgrounds. With the additional standards added in
California, kindergarten teachers have expressed a need to
have more time (Editorial, 2006). All-day kindergarten pro-
vides the ability to effectively provide the type of instruction
that allows for differentiation and other pedagogical
approaches which benefits low-achieving students (Ray &
Smith, 2010). Studies that focus on early childhood educa-
tion often claim that those who graduated preschool had
fewer children born out of wedlock, were less likely to be on
welfare, and were more likely to be employed (Barnett &
Escobar, 1987). Another study conducted for 19 years com-
pared 989 disadvantaged children, mostly African American,
who attended high-quality preschool with 550 similar chil-
dren who attended full-day kindergarten (Ferrandino &
Tirozzi, 2001). The extraordinary findings revealed that the
preschool children had 41% fewer grade retention and spe-
cial education referrals, had 29% higher high school gradua-
tion rate, and were 33% less likely to be arrested as juveniles.
Both of these studies indicate that the earlier a child's formal
education begins, the more likely they are to be academically
successful and productive citizens.
A 139,000-student district in Montgomery County,
Maryland, instituted a series of reforms within the primary
grades. The 2000-2001 initiatives included full-day kinder-
garten, Class Size Reduction (CSR), a revised curriculum,
and increased communication between school officials and
parents. Results indicated significant test-score gains. The
district's longitudinal study of its initiative, The Early
Success Performance Plan, revealed that children who
entered kindergarten with minimal abilities were able to
meet or exceed the 50th percentile in reading and language
by the end of second grade (Jacobson, 2003). These same
pupils were also more likely to be successful if they remained
in the same school more than 3 years. In contrast, those chil-
dren who entered kindergarten with strong abilities were
successful in second grade, regardless of whether they
received any kindergarten reforms or changed schools.
A research study indicated that more time spent does not
provide academic achievement gains beyond the first grade
for all students (Elicker, 2000). Several studies have also
concluded that any academic edge achieved by full-day kin-
dergarten students dissipates in later years. Academic bene-
fits of full-day kindergarten simply subside soon after
children leave kindergarten (Hare, Howard, & Prince, 2001;
Votruba-Drzal, Li-Grining, & Maldonado-Carren~o, 2008).
Davies and Cress (2010) identify that a passable explanation
to this lack of difference in achievement success could be
attributed to the practice in many school districts of provid-
ing full-day kindergarten programs only to students who are
identified as at risk of academic failure.
A study of the effects on achievement and classroom
behavior in three different kindergarten schedules docu-
mented comparative data within one school district applying
a common kindergarten curriculum to better understand the
characteristics of an early childhood education program
(Hildebrand, 2001). The study was conducted in central
Nebraska and kindergarten schedules were based on the
4 SAGE Open
superintendent's perception of children's needs. Teachers
were asked to rate their perceptions of children's social com-
petence using a rating scale. A family reading inventory was
distributed to survey parents' participation in their children's
literacy development during the spring. No significant dif-
ferences for group means were found for reading raw scores
and reading percentile scores. The study's findings suggest that
there are no clear differential effects of kindergarten schedules
on academic achievement and classroom social behaviors. In
order for the results to generalize to other populations, school
districts must consider SES, ethnicity, and other variables in
their decisions regarding kindergarten schedule. Findings from
this study suggest that more time spent "in school" did not
ensure academic and social/emotional success for young chil-
dren; that the quantity of time in a kindergarten day is no more
important than the quality of time.
Despite the vague and unclear results, some parents are
willing to pay for full day. Parents in Seattle, Washington,
have agreed to pay for their children to attend full-day kin-
dergarten. Some elementary schools within the Seattle area
have been charging parents US$200 per month for 10 months
to provide more full-day kindergarten slots than those
financed with state and district money. The money covers the
cost of hiring enough staff members to reduce class sizes to
approximately 20 students. Seattle's weighted student fund-
ing formula finances full-day kindergarten for students liv-
ing in poverty and lower socioeconomic areas, yet the
middle-class and upper-middle-class neighborhoods do not
receive added funding. Due to the existing population of
middle-class students attending private schools, public
school administrators have offered parents the opportunity to
redirect their monies to financing full-day kindergarten in
their neighborhood schools. In Seattle, public schools are
marketing themselves for paying competition (Gewertz,
2002). In documentation from the Education Commission of
the States (2004), most states are bound to funding formulas
and supplement programs through categorical funding.
Though many schools nationwide offer full-day kindergar-
ten, there are still many who are unable to offer it due to
staffing, facilities, and costs of operation (Magnuson, 2002).
Even if parents are willing to pay for Seattle's extended full-
day kindergarten program, it is obvious that kindergarten
programs will continue to expand throughout the country
provoking interest and controversy.
Some districts like it because it eliminates the need to pro-
vide buses and crossing guards at midday (Chmelynski,
1998). Not only is there concern with providing crossing
guards and bussing but also facilities to house the students,
salaries of teachers, supplies, and curriculum materials for
newly imposed kindergarten standards in response to the
NCLB. Most districts, however, estimate that the expansion
of traditional half-day kindergarten to full-day kindergarten
will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Changes in American society have also encouraged the
growth of full-day kindergarten. Pressure of high-stakes test-
ing, double-income families, and single-parent homes have
influenced educational system. One factor supporting the
need for full-day kindergarten is the academic rigor required
as schools become more accountable for the performance of
their students. Another factor is the number of poor and non-
English-speaking students. Some feel the benefits outweigh
the costs. While there is an impressive amount of research
supporting full-day kindergarten's benefit during the kinder-
garten year and transition to first grade in the social-
emotional development of children, opponents argue that
having a longer school day will not help children improve.
Without good teachers and a good curriculum, a full-day
program could result in children spending more time in a bad
environment. As more and more states propose and pass leg-
islation establishing or expanding full-day kindergarten,
principals need to analyze their schools' programs to ensure
that students are spending more time in a quality learning
environment (Magnuson, 2002). "Just attending a kindergar-
ten program three hours past lunchtime does not begin to
address the dynamics of teaching five-year-olds, nor does it
adequately prepare them for first grade. Doubling the time does
not necessarily double the program quality" (Weast, 2001, p. 9).
It is clear that in an age of diminishing funds, every program
must be evaluated as an academic enterprise.
Method
Is a full-day kindergarten program an effective means to
increase student achievement in later grades? To answer this
question, one must analyze and compare achievement of
students over time. The purpose of this research is to inves-
tigate an all-day kindergarten program to increase student's
achievement. Another central question is the effect of an
all-day kindergarten program on lower socioeconomically
identified students.
The study focuses on the following three hypothesis
statements:
Hypothesis 1: There is not a significant difference
in language arts achievement as measured by the
California Standards assessment between students
attending an all day kindergarten program and those
students who attended a traditional half-day kinder-
garten program.
Hypothesis 2: There is not a significant difference in
math achievement as measured by the California
Standards assessment between students attending
an all day kindergarten program and those students
who attended a traditional half-day kindergarten
program.
Hypothesis 3: Attendance in an all-day kindergarten
program is not a predictor of later achievement in
second-grade students.
If there is a significant difference in achievement of sec-
ond-grade students who attended a full-day kindergarten
program and those who did not, school districts will be able
Milligan 5
to meet the needs of more students. Furthermore, if attend-
ing an all-day kindergarten program is a predictor in young
children and their future success, educators will be able to
use such a program for students who are at risk of failure and
do a better job of designing instruction and providing inter-
ventions to help them learn to succeed.
All-day kindergarten began at the district as a voluntary
pilot program at Elementary School F in 2000-2001. In
1999-2000, a parent survey was developed to determine
whether there was sufficient desire and need for an all-day
kindergarten program at Elementary School F. The survey
revealed that parents overwhelmingly felt that an all-day
kindergarten program would be beneficial to their students.
The all-day kindergarten option was discussed with teachers
and their approval was granted. The program was imple-
mented as a voluntary option for teachers involved. All kin-
dergarten teachers, along with one special education teacher,
wantedtoparticipate.Parentshadtheoptionthroughtheopen-
enrollment process of sending their students to a different
school within the district if they did not want to participate in
the all-day kindergarten program. One parent used the open-
enrollment option at the beginning of the school year, and
one additional parent transferred his student at the middle of
the school year. The original kindergarten program at
Elementary School F consisted of two half-day morning ses-
sions and one half-day afternoon session. This program was
modified into three all-day kindergarten classes. No addi-
tional classrooms were needed to implement the program.
The two morning sessions already had assigned classrooms.
The afternoon session was combined with a full-inclusion
special education class, and therefore no additional class-
room was needed.
Program Description
The full-day kindergarten program lasts between 6 hr and 20
min and 6 hr and 15 min depending on the school site. A full
week program consists of 1,875 to 1,900 min. Of that time,
approximately 26% (494 min) of the time is spent on
reading/language arts. Approximately 10% (190 min) of the
time is spent on math. A total of 7% of the time is spent on
science, social studies, and music/physical education (PE).
In all, 15% (285 min) of the time is spent on centers, library,
videos, and general classroom activities. Another 13% (247
min) of the time is spent on opening, attendance, pledge of
allegiance, calendar, and cleanup. A total of 29% (551 min)
is spent on recess, lunch, snack, and quiet time. All times
were established district program­recommended guidelines.
The partial-day kindergarten program lasts 3 hr and 15
min. A full week program consists of 975 min. Of that time,
approximately 7% (68 min) is spent on opening, attendance,
pledge of allegiance, and calendar. A total of 38% (370 min)
is spent on English/language arts. Another 13% (127 min) is
spent on math. Another 13% (127 min) is spent on PE/social
sciences. Approximately 6% (59 min) is spent on centers,
library, and computer lab and 8% (78 min) is spent on recess.
As with the all-day program, all times were district-
recommended guidelines.
Parents of students enrolled in schools in the district that
do not have an all-day kindergarten program may use the
open-enrollment option to enroll in Elementary School F's
program, and parents are eager to enroll their students. The
full-inclusion classroom is very highly requested. Elementary
School F staff indicate that students receive a much more
enriching kindergarten experience because teachers can
address science, social studies, and fine arts in addition to
mathematics and English/language arts at a less frantic pace.
This is especially beneficial in light of expanded require-
ments and content standards. Teachers find that they can fit
everything in during the day, are able to address content stan-
dards more completely, and can instill good work habits,
procedures, and study skills. All-day kindergarten allows
teachers and students to end each day and each school year
with a feeling of completion.
Elementary School A began their all-day kindergarten
program in 2001-2002. In the 1st year of program implemen-
tation, only one of three (one full day, one morning, one
afternoon) kindergarten classrooms was an all-day program.
In 2002-2003, two of four kindergarten classrooms imple-
mented all-day programs. And in the 2003-2004 school year,
four of four kindergarten classrooms offered all-day pro-
grams. All-day kindergarten was offered on a voluntary basis
by teacher request and did not impact classroom space at the
school. The program began because of a local Charter School
offering a full-day program and Elementary SchoolAwanted
to be competitive. Also, there were many parent inquiries,
and parent requested for the all-day program. Only one par-
ent did not want to participate and was offered the option of
open enrollment at another school.
Elementary School C implemented the all-day kinder-
garten program in the 2003-2004 school year. The program
was implemented by teacher request and consisted of one
all-day kindergarten, and one K-1 combination class. The
teacher felt a need for the full-day program to be able to
cover all of the California standards and requirements.
ElementarySchoolChadadequatespaceandofferedtheopen-
enrollment option for parents not wanting to participate. No
parent opted out of the program.
While achievement testing is limited in kindergarten and
first grade with teacher anecdotal assessment, statewide
standardizing testing was available in the second grade. The
decision was made to use an assessment that has strict stan-
dards for validity and reliability, which allows for a less sub-
jective program evaluation. The California Standardized
Testing and Reporting (STAR) Assessment Program was
selected as the vehicle for that assessment.
For the past several years, the California public schools
have been administering the STAR Testing program. The
purpose of the STAR program is to help measure how well
students are learning the California academic standards.
Beginning in 2003, California public schools are also under
the federal accountability system outlined in NCLB. Both
6 SAGE Open
the Academic Performance Index (API) and Annual Yearly
Progress (AYP) are reported each year. Teachers, parents,
and administrators use these test results to monitor each stu-
dent's progress. The results are used in combination with
other indicators of student achievement to help make deci-
sions about ways to improve student learning and school
programs.
The Public Schools Accountability Act (PSAA) was
signed into law in California in April of 1999. This law
authorized the establishment of the first statewide account-
ability system for California public schools. One major com-
ponent of this accountability system is the API, which is the
cornerstone of the PSAA. Both the California Standards Test
(CST) and the California Achievement Test 6th Edition
(CAT 6) test results are used to calculate each school's API.
The NCLB act of 2001, which reauthorized the federal
Elementary and Secondary Act (ESEA), requires all districts
and schools to demonstrate Adequate Yearly Progress, with
an eventual goal that 100% of all students will be proficient
or above in reading/language arts and mathematics by
2013-2014.
The all-day kindergarten study included two custom
groups of students. One group consisted of full-day kinder-
garten students and the second group included the traditional
half-day kindergarten students who began in the 2003-2004
school year. STAR CST scores in English, reading and writ-
ing; and in math, number sense, algebra, measurement and
geometry, statistics, data analysis, and probability; and (CAT 6)
scores in reading, language arts, and math were gathered for
each student and for each group of students as a result of the
spring 2005 test administration. Data were disaggregated
into categories including free and reduced meals, ELL, gen-
der, and ethnicity. The data from each category were ana-
lyzed through Statistical Package Social Sciences (SPSS)
software to determine results of any significance.
A total of 208 students from a K-12 school district in
southern California participated in the study. This longitudi-
nal study was conducted over 3 years. In all, 43 all-day kin-
dergarten students and 165 randomly selected traditional
kindergarten program students all who maintained continu-
ous enrollment from kindergarten through second grade
were administered the California Standards assessment in
Grade 2. Two years later, when the students were in the sec-
ond grade, language arts and math scores were obtained as
measured by the California State­mandated State Standards
Assessment as part of the California STAR Assessment. The
independent-samples t-test was used to evaluate the differ-
ence in achievement in a variety of subjects. Reading, writ-
ing, algebra functions, number sense, measurement, and
statistics and probability as well as normal curve equivalence
(NCE) scores of the CAT 6 math and reading assessments
were used in the means comparisons test. Also included as a
variable is the achievement classification which uses a
5-point scale (5 being highest) in English language arts and
math to determine if a student is functioning below, at, or
above grade level. In addition, using stepwise multiple
regression, several independent variables were introduced
into the regression equation to obtain a Prediction Model of
All Day Kindergarten Achievement. The assessment scores
of the entire battery of test were used as the dependent vari-
able in separate regression runs. The independent variables
used were (a) SES (as determined by free/reduced lunch sta-
tus), (b) ELL status, (c) all-day kindergarten status, and (d)
gender status.
Setting and Sample
The participating school district resides in an urban area with
a medium-size population. The city's school district serves
approximately 6,000 students in grade spans K-12th grade.
The district's demographic data are displayed in Table 1.
Containing six elementary schools, the study district spans
three city geographical areas. In addition, the district main-
tains a state-approved preschool that serves approximately
100 students. None of the participating students in the study
participated in the preschool program.
All kindergarten students who attended the all-day pro-
gram and were still maintaining attendance, within the district,
participated in the study. The 165 students who participated in
only the traditional program were randomly selected from the
remaining total district population but had also attended the
district school continually since kindergarten.
Data Collection Procedures
All students were administered the battery of tests required
for California state students in Grade 2 in the spring of 2006.
CST
The CST is the cornerstone of the California STAR Program.
Given in English, the CST is designed to assess how well
students are doing with respect to the California academic
standards in English-language arts, mathematics, history-
social science, and science. These academic standards
describe what students should know and be able to do at
each grade level. The individual STAR Student Report pro-
vides overall scaled scores and performance levels for each
CST. Overall scaled scores are reported on a scale ranging
from 150 to 600. Performance levels are advanced, profi-
cient, basic, below basic, or far below basic. The state target
is for all students to attain the proficient or advanced level
on the CSTs. The range of scores that belong to each perfor-
mance standard varies by grade, content area, and year.
However, regardless of grade and content area, the range for
the basic level of performance is between 300 and 349.
California assigns performance standards for content areas
but not for standards and substandards.

CAT 6
The CAT 6 assesses the achievement of basic academic
skills in key subjects that are commonly taught in public
schools throughout the United States. The CAT 6 compares
the performance of California students to the performance of
students throughout the nation who take this assessment.
Students in Grades 2 to 11 are tested in reading, language,
and mathematics. Students in Grades 2 to 8 are also tested in
spelling, and students in Grades 9 to 11 are tested in science.
The CAT 6 reports student scores for each subject area as
raw scores, scaled scores, and percentile ranks. The 50th
percentile rank is the national average, and a score between
the 40th and 60th percentiles is considered an average score.
Data Analysis Procedures
The study's assessments yield data with either interval or
Likert-type scaling. Given this type of data, the hypothesis
was assessed using parametric statistical procedures. There
were two procedures used: (A) the independent-samples t-test
procedure comparing means for the two groups and (B) step-
wise multiple regression. Measures of central tendency were
also calculated. The significance level selected for this study
is the conventional .05 level. This means that the results will
not be termed significant unless only 1 out of 20 times the
relationship could be obtained based on chance alone.
During the spring of 2005, students were administered the
standardized tests of California Standards Assessment and
the CAT 6. Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions
were calculated using the statistical software package SPSS
11. All National Percentile Rankings (NPR) were converted
to Normal Curve Equivalents (NCE) to perform all calcula-
tion, and then converted back to NPR. Using the method of
mean substitution eliminated problems that might have
occurred because of missing data. In addition, to avoid prob-
lems of multicollinearity, a tolerance level of .30 was uti-
lized. Normal probability plots were used to examine the
assumption of normality and the Levene test was used for
equality of variances. All variables tested were found to be
normal in their distributions.
Results and Discussion
The results and discussions in this section are to assist in the
development of programs to improve achievement in ele-
mentary school students by analyzing various independent
variables a typical student may encounter in his or her future
academic experience.
The results are presented in four parts. First, descriptive
statistics of the entire sample and subsamples are discussed.
Frequency distributions (Table 2) as well as measures of cen-
tral tendency for all-day kindergarten students and tradi-
tional kindergarten are presented. Sample cross-tabulation
are displayed (Tables 3, 4, and 5) to develop an understand-
ing of the unique characteristics of each group (all day vs.
traditional). Because the significance value for the Levene
test was high (greater than 0.05), only the results that assume
equal variances for both groups is displayed. Second, prior to
performing hypotheses testing, each group must be separated
into gender, ELL status, and free/reduced lunch status. Third,
the independent-samples t test was used to evaluate the dif-
ference in achievement in the selected subject areas (Table 6)
for all subjects and for each subgroup. Fourth, stepwise mul-
tiple regression runs were made using the dependent variable
(Math Standards Level and English language arts [ELA]
Standards Level) and the independent variables of gender,
ELL status, free/reduced status, and all-day kindergarten
status (Tables 7, 8, and 9).
Descriptive Statistics
Slightly less than 50% of the students in the sample were
female (102), whereas 51% were male (106). In all, 48% of the
students were participating in the free and reduced lunch pro-
gram (100), whereas 52% were not (108). Although ethnicity

was not germane to this study, participants noted the race that
they most closely identified with. The result of this information
is reported in Table 10.
Language proficiency was also not the subject of this
study but was used to create subgroups to avoid inaccurate
analysis that may occur because of language proficiency.
Table 4 displays the Language proficiency frequencies for
the participants.
Independent-Sample t-Test Analysis
Using all available assessment, there were no significant dif-
ferences in the scores of students who attended an all-day
kindergarten and those who did not (Table 6). These results
remained the same for males and females as well as for each
subgroup of students (ELL and free and reduced lunch).
Only the Standards Measure score for non-ELL students
approached significance (.058). Scores for all-day kinder-
garten students were slightly higher but none proved to test
significant.
Regression Analysis
While a significant model was developed, attendance in an all-
day kindergarten program was not among the predictors. Free
and reduced lunch status proved to be the most useful tool when
predicting student reading success (R2 of .052). Table 7 displays
R, R2, adjusted R2, and the standard error. R, the multiple cor-
relation coefficient, is the correlation between the observed and
predicted values of the dependent variable. The values of R for
prediction models produced by the regression procedures range
from 0 to 1. Larger values of R indicate stronger relationships.
R2 is the proportion of variation in the dependent variable
explained by the regression model. The values of R2 range from
0 to 1. Small values indicate that the model does not fit the data
well. The sample R2 tends to optimistically estimate how well
the model fits the population.Adjusted R2 attempts to correct R2
to more closely reflect the goodness of fit of the model in the
population.

the residual sum of squares indicates that the model accounts
for most of variation in the dependent variable. Very high
residual sum of squares indicate that the model fails to
explain a lot of the variation in the dependent variable, and
you may want to look for additional factors that help account
for a higher proportion of the variation in the dependent vari-
able. Clearly, the data revealed a much higher residual result
(196.324) and a low regression sum indicating that the inde-
pendent variables used fail to explain the variations in the
dependent variable.
Table 9 further explores the data set by analysis of the
regression coefficients. Often the independent variables are
measures in different units. The standardized coefficients or
betas are an attempt to make the regression coefficients more
comparable. The t statistics can help you determine the rela-
tive importance of each variable in the model. Even though
the model produced a significant predictor (free and reduced
lunch status R2 = .052) it is not considered useful. This result
remained constant for all subgroups using ELA and math
achievement levels as dependent variables.
Discussion and Conclusion
Hypothesis 1 is accepted; there is not a significant difference
in language arts achievement as measured by the California
Standards assessment between students attending an full-
day kindergarten program and those students who attended a
traditional half-day kindergarten program. Hypothesis 2
is accepted; there is not a significant difference in math
achievement as measured by the California Standards
assessment between students attending a full-day kindergar-
ten program and those students who attended a traditional
half-day kindergarten program. Hypothesis 3 is accepted,
attendance in a full-day kindergarten program is not a pre-
dictor of achievement in second-grade students.

All three hypotheses of the current research are accepted
and display results similar to that of a study that found no
clear differential effects of kindergarten schedules in both
academic achievement and classroom social behaviors
(Hildebrand, 2001). These findings also replicate a recent
meta-analysis of full-day kindergarten programs, which
determined that most benefits fade after the third grade
(Cooper, Allen, Patall, & Dent, 2010).
Both studies, however, agree that school districts need to
consider SES, ethnicity, level of parent education, and other
variables in their decisions regarding full-day kindergarten.
In support of the current findings, a comprehensive literature
review of full-day versus traditional half-day kindergarten
programs found similar results in that the benefits of full-day
programs were not apparent in later years (Lash, Bae, Barrat,
Burr, & Fong, 2008). Participation in full-day kindergarten
or traditional half-day kindergarten does not appear to be a
predictor of a students' overall math and reading scores in
later grades.
Often parents are surveyed for their opinion or desire for
full-day kindergarten, which usually results in an over-
whelming favor of full-day kindergarten. Many principals
feel the pressure to incorporate such programs when the pub-
lic displays such desire, when the parent's decision is not
educationally sound but rather based on the need for after-
noon day care. Likewise in the current research study, the
district surveyed parents to determine if there was sufficient
evidence to support a full-day kindergarten program. There
was not one survey that did not support a full-day kindergar-
ten program. Fortunately, there was no additional cost to the
district as is felt by many school districts across the nation.
From the review of literature, research comparing full-
day kindergarten versus traditional half-day kindergarten
programs generally finds positive effects of full-day pro-
grams on end-of-year measures of reading readiness, lan-
guage, and other objectives. However, few studies that have
examined the benefits of full-day kindergarten effects in
later years found evidence of benefits even as early as at the
end of first grade (Karweit, Slavin, & Wasik, 1993).
Despite the increase in the popularity of kindergarten,
very little research specifically examines the academic ben-
efits of full-day kindergarten versus traditional half-day kin-
dergarten in later grades. The vast majority of studies focus
their research on the benefits of full-day kindergarten and the
academic achievement gained at the end of kindergarten or
first-grade students. There is a lack of literature that reports
on the findings concerning the long-term effects of full-day
kindergarten versus traditional half-day kindergarten in stu-
dent math and reading scores in later grades. Regardless,
full-day kindergarten is sweeping the nation, costing mil-
lions of dollars to school districts that have based their deci-
sions on greater school achievement, pressure from day care
family needs, and inconclusive research. Before policy mak-
ers mandate full-day kindergarten programs, they should
seek longitudinal studies to substantiate their million dollar
decisions.
Young children's learning is intimately connected to and
will depend on their cultures, languages, and communities.
Nonacademic strengths such as emotional competence or
positive approaches to learning when children enter kinder-
garten are strong predictors of academic skills in later grades.
Many of the benefits associated with full-day kindergarten
remain anecdotal; isolating the effects of extra class time
from factors such as class size, teaching methodology,
teacher experience, and parent involvement proves to be
difficult.
As do most studies, additional questions for future
research always arise. Would other all-day kinder programs
generate the same effect? Would students of different demo-
graphics produce a more significant difference in achieve-
ment? Is using standardized testing the best way to determine
a program's success? This study may be one of many to pro-
vide information that leads researchers in new directions as
the struggle to learn the most effective ways to increase
achievement in children continues. In closing, to identify
programs that produce lasting effects, longitudinal research
must become an integral part and priority of the educational
system. Perhaps it was best captured by a saying which was
