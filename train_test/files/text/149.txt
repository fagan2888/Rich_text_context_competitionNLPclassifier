Abstract
This paper studies the flow-performance relationship of three different investor
groups in mutual funds: Households, financial corporations, and insurance compa-
nies and pension funds, establishing the following findings: Financial corporations
have a strong tendency to chase past performance and also hold an increased share
in the top performing funds. Insurance companies and pension funds show some
evidence of performance chasing, but are underrepresented in the best performing
funds. Households chase performance, but they are also subject to status quo bias
in their flows. Regarding investor composition the worst performing funds show
no significant difference in their investor structure when compared to funds with
average performance.
Keywords: Mutual Funds, Flow-Performance Relationship, Clientele

Non-technical summary
Mutual fund investors chase past performance, even though performance is not per-
sistent over time. This means that investors buy mutual funds that had a high return in
the past. On the other hand, investors are reluctant to withdraw their money from the
worst performing funds. This behavior has often been attributed to the irrationality of
mutual fund investors, but there are also rational explanations for this investor behavior,
such as the model of Berk and Green (2004).
The rational explanation by Berk and Green states that sophisticated investors chase
performance in order to find managerial ability. But since managerial ability has decreas-
ing economies of scale, fund performance deteriorates when inflows occur. This explains
why it is rational to chase past performance even though performance is not persistent.
The fact that some investors do not withdraw their money is explained by "disadvantaged
clienteles" in mutual funds, i.e. investors who are unwilling or hindered by restrictions to
follow a performance chasing strategy.
This paper investigates whether there are such disadvantaged clienteles in mutual
funds. A unique data set, the Securities Deposits Statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank,
allows me to differentiate not only between retail and institutional investors, but also
between different institutional investors such as financial corporations as well as insur-
ance companies and pension funds. These investor groups are likely to differ in their
behavior when buying and selling mutual fund shares. The main findings of this paper
are as follows: First, financial corporations show a strong tendency to chase past perfor-
mance. Second, there is some evidence that insurance corporations and pension funds
chase performance, although not as strongly as financial corporations. Furthermore, in-
surance companies and pension funds do not invest in all mutual funds in the sample.
Insurance companies and pension funds tend to invest in larger, older and less volatile
funds, which results in the fact that insurance companies and pension funds hold only a
lower fraction in the top performing funds. The difference between the two institutional
investor groups can be explained by additional regulations for insurance companies and
pension funds, which makes these investors institutionally disadvantaged. Third, evidence
for retail investors is mixed. Households chase past winners to some extent, but compared
to financial corporations the inflows to top performing funds are considerably smaller in
size. Furthermore, retail flows show a significant first-order autocorrelation, while insti-
tutional investors do not. This autocorrelation pattern in retail flows can be caused by
advertising of the funds, savings plans or by status quo bias of the investors. Both flows
due to advertising and status quo bias are associated with unsophisticated investors or
disadvantaged investors.
These results are consistent with the Berk-Green model. In particular the result that
institutional investors chase past performance is of interest, since performance chasing is
mostly associated with uneducated or irrational investors. Finally, the paper investigates
whether investor groups differ in their behavior of punishing mutual fund managers by
withdrawing their money from poorly performing funds. There is no clear evidence that
one investor group punishes poor performance more than the other group.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Im Bereich der Investmentfonds lassen sich starke Mittelzufl¨
usse bei denjenigen Fonds
feststellen, die in der Vergangenheit ¨
uberdurchschnittlich abgeschnitten haben. Dieses
Verhalten, bei dem sich Investoren an vergangener Performance eines Fonds orientieren,
wird in der Literatur als "Performance Chasing" bezeichnet. ¨
Uberraschend ist hierbei,
dass es zu Performance Chasing kommt, obwohl gute Performance von Investmentfonds
meistens nicht lange anh¨
alt. Im Gegensatz dazu kann man beobachten, dass Investoren
nicht ihr Geld von schlechten Fonds abzuziehen. Diese Verhaltensweise von Investoren
wird oft als irrational bezeichnet.
Berk und Green (2004) zeigen jedoch, dass es auch eine rationale Erkl¨
arung f¨
ur Per-
formance Chasing geben kann. Im Modellrahmen von Berk und Green verfolgen In-
vestoren eine Performance-Chasing-Strategie, um f¨
ahige Fondsmanager, d.h. Manager
die eine ¨
Uberrendite generieren, zu finden. Mit wachsender Gr¨
oße des Fonds, d.h. bei
starken Fondszufl¨
ussen, nimmt allerdings die F¨
ahigkeit des Fondsmanagers den Markt
zu schlagen ab. Starke Mittelzufl¨
usse reduzieren die ¨
Uberrendite eines Fonds solange,
bis der Fonds nicht mehr den Markt schl¨
agt. Dies erkl¨
art, warum Performance Chas-
ing rational sein kann, auch wenn kein Fonds langfristig eine ¨
Uberrendite erzielen kann.
Die Tatsache, dass es nur wenig Abfl¨
usse aus schlechten Fonds gibt, erkl¨
art das Berk-
Green-Modell durch sogenannte "benachteiligte Investoren", die entweder nicht ratio-
nal sind, oder durch ¨
außere Gegebenheiten oder Regulierungen gehindert werden ihre
Mittel abzuziehen. Dieser Aufsatz untersucht, ob solche benachteilige Investorengruppen
in Fonds existieren. Die Depotstatistik der Deutschen Bundesbank erlaubt hierbei nicht
nur eine Unterscheidung zwischen privaten und institutionellen Investoren, sondern auch
zwischen verschiedenen Typen innerhalb der institutionellen Investoren (beispielsweise
Finanzinstitute sowie Versicherungen und Pensionskassen). F¨
ur diese Investorengruppen
ist jeweils ein unterschiedliches Verhalten in Bezug auf die Kauf- und Verkaufsentschei-
dung von Fonds zu erwarten.
Die Ergebnisse lassen sich folgendermaßen zusammenfassen: Erstens, Finanzinstitute
betreiben eine klare Performance-Chasing-Strategie. Zweitens kann festgestellt werden,
dass auch Versicherungen und Pensionskassen eine Performance-Chasing-Strategie verfol-
gen, diese aber weniger ausgepr¨
agt ist als bei Finanzinstituten. Des Weiteren investieren
Versicherungen und Pensionskassen nicht in alle Investmentfonds. Sie bevorzugen gr¨
oßere
und ¨
altere Fonds, sowie Fonds mit geringerer Volatilit¨
at. Dies f¨
uhrt dazu, dass Ver-
sicherungen und Pensionskassen nur einen geringen Anteil an den besten Fonds halten.
Die Unterschiede zwischen diesen beiden institutionellen Anlegergruppen k¨
onnen durch
die zus¨
atzliche Regulierung von Versicherung und Pensionskassen erkl¨
art werden, die
als "institutionelle Benachteiligung" bezeichnet werden kann. Die Ergebnisse bez¨
uglich
privater Haushalte sind uneinheitlich. Auch in dieser Investorengruppe kann Performance
Chasing festgestellt werden, allerdings in einem wesentlich geringeren Umfang als bei
institutionellen Investoren. Außerdem kann eine betr¨
achtliche Autokorrelation in den
Fondsfl¨
ussen der Haushalte beobachtet werden, was bei institutionellen Investoren nicht
der Fall ist. Autokorrelation in Fondsfl¨
ussen kann auf Werbung der Fonds, bestehende
Sparpl¨
ane oder Status-Quo-Bias der Investoren zur¨
uckgef¨
uhrt werden. Fondsfl¨
usse auf-
grund von Werbung und Status-Quo-Bias werden eher irrationalen Investoren bzw. benach-
teiligten Investoren zugerechnet.
Diese Ergebnisse sind konsistent mit dem Berk-Green-Modell. Hervorzuheben ist das
Ergebnis, dass institutionelle Investoren Performance Chasing betreiben. Dieses Verhalten
ist bislang in der Literatur eher unerfahrenen bzw. irrationalen Investoren zugeschrieben
worden. In diesem Artikel wird zudem untersucht, ob sich die Investorengruppen in
ihrem Verhalten, schlechte Performance durch Abfl¨
usse zu sanktionieren, unterscheiden.
Ein signifikanter Unterschied zwischen den Investorengruppen kann hier jedoch nicht fest-
gestellt werden.

1 Introduction
Mutual fund investors chase past performance, even though performance is not persistent
over time. On the other hand, investors are reluctant to withdraw their money from the
worst performing funds (see e.g. Sirri & Tufano 1998, Carhart 1997). This behavior has
often been attributed to the irrationality of mutual fund investors.
In contrast to behavioral explanations, Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004) de-
velop a model in which investors rationally chase past performance. They assume that
fund managers possess different levels of investment ability. Mutual funds' future perfor-
mance is thus partly predictable from past performance. Sophisticated investors realize
this and therefore rationally chase past performance. Since managerial ability is assumed
to have decreasing returns to scale, a well performing manager will attract inflows until
he or she is no longer able to outperform the market. By the same mechanism investors
leave poorly performing funds up to the point where the funds cease to underperform.
Thus, performance of mutual funds is not persistent, precisely because investors chase
past performance.
The worst performing mutual funds, however, keep performing poorly (see Carhart
1997). Arguing in the framework of Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004) the persis-
tence of the worst performing funds is caused by the fact that some investors are unwilling
or hindered from withdrawing their money (see Berk & Tonks 2007). This cannot be cor-
rected by other investors, since they cannot short-sell mutual fund shares. The persistence
of the worst performing funds is therefore attributed to unsophisticated or disadvantaged
investor clienteles that do not withdraw their money from poorly performing funds. So
are there disadvantaged clienteles in mutual funds, and if so, who are they?
Using a unique data set, that allows the identification of different investor groups in
mutual funds, this paper tries to address this question. The data set comes from the
Securities Deposits Statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank, which record the depositors
of securities held in Germany. Through this information I am able to obtain the investor
1
structure of mutual funds. In particular, the data enables me to differentiate not only be-
tween retail and institutional investors, but also between different institutional investors
such as financial corporations and insurance companies and pension funds. These in-
vestor groups are likely to differ in their behavior. Financial corporations are arguably
the most sophisticated investors and should invest according to performance. The group of
private investors can include both sophisticated investors and unsophisticated investors.
Insurance companies and pension funds are financially sophisticated, but can be insti-
tutionally disadvantaged because of regulatory restrictions. By identifying these three
investor groups and analyzing their behavior within the same mutual fund I am able to
directly test hypotheses deduced from the Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004) model.
The main findings of this paper are as follows: First, financial corporations show a
strong tendency to chase past performance, which is statistically and economically signif-
icant. The best performing funds experience inflows of up to 31 percentage points higher
than the average fund. Consequently, the percentage of mutual fund shares held by fi-
nancial corporations is higher for the best performing funds than for the average fund.
While financial corporations hold an average of 13 percent in mutual funds, they hold
about 18-19 percent in the best performing funds. The fact that financial corporations
chase past performance is telling, because financial corporations are probably the most
sophisticated investors and chasing past returns of mutual funds has often been attributed
to unsophisticated investors. Thus, the finding that sophisticated investors chase perfor-
mance provides strong support for the theory proposed by Gruber (1996) and Berk &
Green (2004).
Second, there is some evidence that insurance corporations and pension funds are chas-
ing performance, although not as strongly as financial corporations. Moreover, insurance
companies and pension funds do not invest in all mutual funds in the sample. Insurance
companies and pension funds tend to invest in larger and older funds, funds with high
fees and less volatility, which results in the fact that insurance companies and pension
2
funds only hold around 10-12 percent of shares in the top performing funds, while the
average share of this investor group is around 16 percent.
Third, evidence for retail investors is mixed. Households chase past winners to some
extent, but compared to financial corporations the inflows to top performing funds are
considerably smaller in size. Top mutual funds only experience around 3 percentage
point higher inflows than the average fund. Furthermore, retail flows show a significant
first-order autocorrelation, while both institutional investors - financial corporations, and
insurance companies and pension funds - do not. This result is robust for all specifications
and economically meaningful. All other things being equal, a fund that experienced an
increase in retail flows of 10 percentage points in the previous quarter grows in the current
quarter by an additional 2.6 percentage points. This autocorrelation pattern in retail
flows can either be caused by unobserved fund characteristics, such as advertising and
distribution channels, savings plans or by status quo bias. Both flows due to advertising
and status quo bias are associated with unsophisticated investors.
Finally, the paper investigates whether investor groups differ in their behavior of pun-
ishing mutual fund managers by withdrawing their money from poorly performing funds.
There is some evidence that financial corporations punish the worst performing funds
by withdrawing their money. However, when looking at the percentage shares held by
the investor groups, the investor composition of the worst performing funds does not
systematically differ from the investor composition of the average fund.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related
literature and develops the testable hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data set that is
used. Section 4 investigates the differences in the flow-performance relationship of the var-
ious investor groups. Section 5 analyzes the investor composition subject to performance.
Section 6 concludes.

2 Related Literature and Hypotheses
A wealth of literature investigates the flows of mutual fund investors as a response to past
performance. This flow-performance relationship of investors in mutual funds has been
found to be convex (e.g. Ippolito 1992, Chevalier & Ellison 1997, Sirri & Tufano 1998):
mutual funds with high performance receive overproportional inflows, while funds with
low performance experience only mild outflows. Ber, Kempf & Ruenzi (2007) and Jank &
Wedow (2010) confirm this convex flow-performance relationship for the German mutual
fund market.
There are several studies that investigate the flow-performance relationship of mu-
tual funds in connection with investor heterogeneity. Christoffersen & Musto (2002) find
heterogeneity among money market fund investors. On the one hand there is a group
of investors that is responsive to performance; on the other there are investors that do
not respond to bad performance by withdrawing their money. Investor heterogeneity can
therefore explain the cross-sectional fee dispersion among money market funds.
There is also evidence for investor heterogeneity in equity funds. Del Guercio & Tkac
(2002) find different flow-performance relationships among mutual and pension funds.
James & Karceski (2006) observe differences between investors in institutional and retail
funds and Chen, Yao & Yu (2007) find differences between the clientele of funds issued
by insurance and non-insurance companies. This paper contributes to the literature of
investor heterogeneity in mutual funds by directly analyzing the flow-performance rela-
tionship of various investor groups within the same fund.
The main focus of this paper thus lies in testing a theory put forth by Gruber (1996)
and Berk & Green (2004). In their model they assume that mutual fund managers possess
different investment abilities. Since mutual funds sell at net asset value, managerial ability
is not priced. A mutual fund with high management ability is therefore underpriced.
Sophisticated investors will realize this fact and buy (underpriced) well performing funds
and leave underperforming funds, while disadvantaged or unsophisticated investors stay
4
behind. In the Berk & Green (2004) model managerial ability is subject to decreasing
economies of scale (see Chen et al. 2004). Thus, inflows of sophisticated investors into top
performing funds continue until the size of the fund has increased up to the point where
the mutual fund manager is not expected to outperform the market. The first testable
hypothesis, as formulated by Gruber, is therefore:
Hypothesis 1: Sophisticated investors constitute a larger percentage of cash
flows into and out of mutual funds than disadvantaged in-
vestors.
If sophisticated investors identify skilled fund managers faster than unsophisticated
investors and also leave poorly performing funds faster, this should also affect the stock
of funds held by the investor groups. The second testable hypothesis is therefore about
the percentage shares held by the different investor groups. If sophisticated investors exit
poorly performing funds first, it will mostly be disadvantaged investors who stay behind.
This is what Berk & Tonks (2007) call a "burnout" in analogy to the mortgage backed
securities market. By the same argument the share of sophisticated investors will increase
in the funds that overperform. Thus, the second testable hypothesis is twofold (Gruber
1996):
Hypothesis 2a: Mutual funds that overperform contain a larger proportion of
sophisticated clientele than a fund with average performance.
Hypothesis 2b: Mutual funds that underperform contain a larger proportion of
disadvantaged clientele than a fund with average performance.
This gives rise to the following question: Which groups in a mutual fund are so-
phisticated, unsophisticated or disadvantaged? Gruber (1996) proposes the following
categorization, where mutual fund investors are divided into sophisticated and disadvan-
taged investors. Sophisticated investors are defined as investors who invest according to
performance. The group of disadvantaged investors consists of the following sub-groups:
5
First, there are unsophisticated investors, who are influenced by other factors besides
performance, such as advertising or brokerage advice. Second, there are institutionally
disadvantaged investors, who are restricted in their investment decisions by regulations.1
This study will test these key hypotheses by investigating the flow-performance rela-
tionship and percentage holdings of three different investor groups: Households, financial
corporations, and insurance companies and pension funds. If the theory by Gruber (1996)
and Berk & Green (2004) is correct, we should expect differences in the investor groups'
flow-performance sensitivities. Financial corporations are arguably the most sophisti-
cated investors and should therefore have a strong flow-performance sensitivity, i.e. they
should strongly chase performance and also heavily punish the worst performing funds
by withdrawing money. The degree of financial sophistication for households is unclear a
priori. Insurance companies and pension funds are financially sophisticated but compared
to other institutional investors they are disadvantaged, because regulations restrict what
they are able to invest in. In Germany insurance companies and pension funds are both
regulated by the same law, the Insurance Supervision Act (Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz,
VAG), and are supervised by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt
f¨
ur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin). This regulation requires insurance companies
and pension funds to verify that their investments in mutual funds comply with prudent-
man principles. The three investor groups consequently differ in their decisions whether
to buy and sell mutual fund shares. The following section will describe the data set used
in this study.
1Furthermore, Gruber names tax disadvantaged investors, for whom the tax considerations make it
inefficient to redeem their shares from a fund. The complication of the tax overhang caused by capital
gains tax (see e.g. Barclay et al. 1998) does not apply for Germany.
6
3 Data
3.1 Mutual Fund Data and Depositor Structure
The sample consists of mutual funds that are registered in Germany and are thus required
to report to the central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank.2 The reporting data is the
main data set and contains, among other things information about the numbers of shares
outstanding, total net assets, buy and sell prices and dividends payed. The data set also
includes funds that have either ceased to exist or have merged with other funds and is
therefore survivorship-bias free. I only consider actively managed mutual funds that are
primarily offered to individuals, i.e. I omit index funds and funds that are exclusively for
institutional investors. To make funds comparable I only consider funds with a sufficient
number of funds in their peer group:3 funds that invest in Germany, Europe and funds
with a global investment objective. The information about the investment objective as
well as the total expense ratio was obtained from the German Federal Association of
Investment Companies (Bundesverband Deutscher Investmentgesellschaften, BVI).
The mutual fund data is matched with data from the Securities Deposits Statistics of
the Deutsche Bundesbank. Starting with the last quarter of 2005 the Securities Deposits
Statistics record data on the depositor structure of financial securities held in Germany.
The statistics give the amount of shares held by a certain depositor group in a financial
security or, in this case, in a mutual fund. I investigate three major investor groups:
Households, financial corporations, and insurance corporations and pension funds. Fi-
nancial corporations include credit institutions, other financial intermediaries such as
investment funds and financial auxiliaries and exclude insurance corporations and pen-
2There are a number of funds that are registered in Luxembourg and marketed in Germany. These
funds do not report to the Deutsche Bundesbank and are therefore not contained in the sample.
3I omit index funds, sector funds and foreign single-country funds.
7
sion funds.4 For simplicity, the term financial corporations will always exclude insurance
companies and pension funds in the following analysis.
The Securities Deposits Statistics collect data from financial institutions in Germany
on the basis of a security-by-security reporting system. Financial institutions report the
number of shares of their customers or their own holdings in a mutual fund. These shares
are categorized into depositor groups by the financial institutions and then reported to
the Deutsche Bundesbank, which aggregates the data for each fund. Deviations between
the actual number of shares outstanding and the number of shares reported can either
be caused by shares that are held by depositors which are not reported (e.g. foreign
shareholders) or by double counting. For this reason I cross-check the aggregate number
of shares from the deposits statistics with the number of shares outstanding. Descriptive
statistics for the sample can be found in Table 1.
The table provides the number of funds in the sample and their investment objective
(Germany, Europe or Global). In addition it displays statistics of common mutual fund
characteristics. Finally, the table shows the number of funds for which information on
the investor structure is available. Coverage of the investor structure is around 60 to
70 percent for 2005 and 2006, but improved to around 90 percent for the years 2007
and 2008. Households hold the majority of assets, but their share decreased from 71
percent in 2005 to around 58 percent at the end of 2008. We see a growing importance of
institutional investors in mutual funds. Especially the group of insurance companies and
pension funds increased their value-weighted shares from 13 in 2005 to 22 in 2008. This
increase might reflect the fact that since the reform of the statutory pension insurance
scheme in Germany in-company and private pension schemes are becoming more and
more important.
4Categorization according to the European System of Accounts (ESA 95): Households (ESA 95 code:
S.14), insurance corporations and pension funds (ESA 95 code: S.125), financial corporations include
credit institutions, other financial intermediaries and financial auxiliaries (ESA 95 code: S.122, S.123 and
S.124). The remaining group includes non-financial corporations, central banks, general government, and
nonprofit institutions serving households (ESA 95 code: S.11, S.121, S.13 and S.15). For further details
see European Commission (1996) and Deutsche Bundesbank (2006).

3.2 Fund Flows
Since the data provides the number of shares being held by every investor group in each
quarter, the calculation of investor flows is straightforward. The net flow of depositor
group j in fund i in period t is calculated as follows:
Flowi,j,t
=
Sharesi,j,t
- Sharesi,j,t-1
Sharesi,j,t-1
, (1)
where Sharesi,j,t
is the amount of shares of fund i held by depositor group j in quarter
t. The total net flow is simply calculated as the relative change in all outstanding shares.
Through this procedure I obtain total net flows and flows for each of the three investor
groups: Households, financial corporations, and insurance companies and pension funds.
Unusual flows can occur for very new funds, when mergers take place or when a fund
closes down. To avoid these outliers I omit observations with a growth rate below and
above the 1st and the 99th percentile.
Following Keswani & Stolin (2008) I calculate time series averages of mean, standard
deviation and percentiles of all investor group flows, which can be found in Table 2. Over-
all, there are weak outflows from mutual funds in the sample period. While households
seem to withdraw money from mutual funds in the sample period, financial corporations,
and insurance companies and pension funds bought mutual fund shares. Furthermore, the
cross-sectional variance of institutional flows is much larger than the variance of private
investors. In particular, financial corporations show the highest variation. This high vari-
ation of institutional flows suggests that institutional investors move their money more
quickly into and out of mutual funds than retail investors do.
Table 3 shows time series averages of pairwise correlations of investor group flows.
The average correlation between the flows of the different groups is surprisingly small.
Keswani & Stolin (2008) find a similarly low correlation between retail and institutional
investors. This low correlation points to the fact that different investor groups behave
very differently when deciding whether to buy and sell funds.

3.3 Performance Measures
Performance is estimated using three measures, which are commonly reported for mutual
funds: Raw Return, Sharpe Ratio and Jensen's Alpha. Raw Returns are calculated
assuming that gross dividends are reinvested immediately. I calculate the Sharpe Ratio
as the average excess return in the evaluation period divided by the variance of returns
(Sharpe 1966):
Sharpe Ratioi
=
Ri
- Rf
V ar(Ri
)
, (2)
where Ri
is the monthly return of fund i and Rf the risk free rate measured by the
1-month EURIBOR. Last, I use the performance measure proposed by Jensen (1968).
Jensen's Alpha is estimated as follows:
Ri
- Rf = i
+ i
(Rm - Rf ), (3)
where Ri
is again the return of fund i and Rf the risk free rate, again measured by
the 1-month EURIBOR, and Rm is the return of the market portfolio. The market
portfolio return is measured by the benchmark index for each investment objective. I use
the following three benchmark indices, which are generally used to evaluate these mutual
funds in their respective peer group: the MSCI Germany, MSCI Europe and MSCI Global
Index. The evaluation period for the performance measures is 24 months. Using shorter
or longer evaluation periods, such as 12 and 36 months, leads to similar results.
This study focuses on these performance measures, because they are easily available
for all investors. Information services such as Morningstar and others provide these on
a regular basis. The performance measures provided can therefore be seen as a signal
of managerial ability, which is available to all investors, institutional and private, at no
or only negligible costs. Thus, the focus of this paper is to answer the question of how
investors react to these observed performance measures by adjusting their flows.
10
4 Flow-Performance Relationship
4.1 Flow-Performance Relationship of Different Investor Groups
In order to estimate the flow-performance relationship I run a piecewise-linear regression
(see Sirri & Tufano 1998, Huang et al. 2007). For each quarter mutual funds are ranked
within their investment objective according to their past performance, where performance
is measured by Raw Return, Sharpe Ratio and Jensen's Alpha over the past 24 months.
This rank is then normalized so that ranks are evenly distributed between zero and one,
where zero is assigned to the worst performing fund and one to the best performing fund.
Funds are then categorized into low, medium and high performing funds: low performing
funds include the lowest performance quintile, medium performing funds the three middle
performance quintiles and the high performing funds the highest performance quintile.
The three variables for the regression are defined in the following way:
Lowi
= Min(Ranki
, 0.20)
Midi
= Min(Ranki
- Lowi
, 0.60) (4)
Highi
= Ranki
- Midi
- Lowi
,
where Ranki
is the percentile rank of the fund. Thus, the coefficients of Low, Mid and
High represent the piecewise decomposition of the percentile rank and can be interpreted
as the slope of the flow-performance relationship within the performance range. The
regression model is specified as follows:
Flowi,j,t
= 0
+ 1
Lowi,t-1
+ 2
Midi,t-1
+ 3
Highi,t-1
(5)
+ 4
Controlsi,t-1
+ i,j,t
,
where Flowi,j,t
is the flow of each investor group j in fund i at quarter t. Control
variables include volatility measured by the 24-month standard deviation of monthly
11
returns, total expenses, fund size measured by the natural logarithm of total net assets,
and fund age measured by the natural logarithm of one plus age in years.5 For each
investor group I also include the flow lagged by one quarter into the regression, since
mutual fund flows show a pattern of autocorrelation. In addition, the regression includes
time dummies and dummies for the investment objectives, which are not reported.
The quarterly regression model is estimated using pooled OLS, since the sample's
time dimension is quite short and the Fama & MacBeth (1973) regression lacks sufficient
statistical power in such a setting. Standard errors are clustered at the fund level.
Table 4 shows the result of this regression for Raw Return, Sharpe Ratio and Jensen's
Alpha. For all performance measures I find a convex flow-performance relationship in total
net flows as can be seen in the first column of Panel A, B and C. Furthermore, the results
show significant first-order autocorrelation in mutual fund flows. The remaining control
variables show the expected signs. Volatility in returns is negatively related to fund flows,
even though only significant in one specification and total fees are also negatively related
to flows. Size and age have no significant influence on flows at the aggregate level. These
findings are comparable to those for the US market (see e.g. Sirri & Tufano 1998, Chen
et al. 2007, Huang et al. 2007).
Looking at the disaggregate flows, however, the three investor groups show pronounced
differences in their flow-performance relationship in the high segment. Financial corpora-
tions have the highest flow-performance sensitivity in this segment. The top performing
funds experience a 31 percentage point higher growth rate than funds in the middle section
(See Panel B). There is some evidence that the group of insurance companies and pension
funds chases past performance, but the coefficient of the high segment is not statistically
significant for all performance measures. Moreover, households chase past performance,
although, the coefficient is much smaller in size.
5Total expenses are measured by expense ratio + 1/3 total load. Since the average holding period
was 2 - 3 years in the sample I adjust the calculation of total fees as proposed by Sirri & Tufano (1998).
Note that Barber et al. (2005) find similar results for US mutual funds with an average holding period
of 30 months in the late 1990s.
12
The first-order autocorrelation of investor flows is also of interest. The positive au-
tocorrelation found in the aggregate net flows of mutual funds can solely be attributed
to the group of households. Insurance companies and pension funds show no significant
autocorrelation and financial corporations show a slightly negative coefficient of lagged
flows, which, however, is only significantly different from zero at a ten percent level. This
result is robust for all specifications and economically meaningful. All other things being
equal, a fund that experienced an increase in retail flows of 10 percentage points in the
previous quarter grows in the current quarter by an additional 2.6 percentage points. The
autocorrelation in retail flows can be explained by unobserved factors such as distribution
channels of the fund family, advertising or simply status quo bias (see e.g. Patel et al.
1991, Goetzmann & Peles 1997, Kempf & Ruenzi 2006). Thus, the autocorrelation of
retail flows is a sign for unsophisticated investors among the group of retail investors. An
alternative explanation is that retail investors are disadvantaged through high transaction
costs, and thus choose to invest continuously in the same fund (e.g. through a savings
plan).
The convex flow-performance relationship in total flows can be seen by the fact that
withdrawals in the low performance segment are not as strong as performance chasing in
the high performance segment. In addition, when comparing the three investor groups,
differences in flow-performance sensitivity in the low performance segment are not as
pronounced as for the high performance segment. Only financial corporations show sig-
nificant outflows from the worst performing funds, when using risk adjusted performance
measures. These findings have to be interpreted with caution since the flows of institu-
tional investors show a high variation and these results might be driven by rather extreme
flows.
In summary, the results mainly support the first hypothesis. Sophisticated investors
account for a larger percentage of cash flows into well performing funds than disadvantaged
investors do. Financial corporations, arguably the most sophisticated investors, chase past
performance to the greatest extent. Insurance companies and pension funds, a group of
13
investors that might be institutionally disadvantaged, show a lower tendency to chase
past performance. The results of households as a group are mixed. On the one hand they
seem to be sophisticated, on the other hand some flows seem to be driven by advertising
or status quo bias. This result is in line with Malloy & Zhu (2004), who find clientele
differences among retail investors. There is some evidence that financial corporations
punish poor performance by withdrawing their money from low performing funds.
As we see in Table 4, insurance companies and pension funds do not invest in all
mutual funds of the sample. They invest only in 968 out of 1350 funds, which is about 71
percent of the sample. Omitting this fact might bias the results of the flow-performance
relationship. To address this potential selection bias I will model both the decision to
invest in a fund or not and the decision regarding how much to invest in the fund (flow
regression) simultaneously in the next section using a Heckman selection model.6
4.2 The Investment Decisions of Insurance Companies and Pen-
sion Funds
The investment decisions of insurance companies and pension funds are different to those
of households and financial corporations. While financial corporations and households can
decide on their own, insurance companies and pension funds are regulated by the Federal
Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and have to prove that their investments in mu-
tual funds comply with prudent-man principles. If these principles are violated, insurance
companies and pension funds are not allowed to invest in the fund. This regulation might
be the reason why there are no insurances and pension funds in one third of the funds
in the sample. Thus, the decision of insurance companies and pension funds is twofold:
first, whether they can invest in the fund or not; and second, how much they invest in
the funds they are allowed to invest in.
6I also run a Heckman selection model for the group of financial corporations as a robustness check.
The results of the Heckman model are very similar to the pooled OLS approach. The Heckman selection
model is not feasible for households, since the number of funds that lack private investors is not sufficient.
14
To capture this two-part decision process I run a Heckman (1979) selection model.
The flow-performance regression for insurance companies and pension funds is specified
as before:
Flowi,j,t
= 0
+ 1
Lowi,t-1
+ 2
Midi,t-1
+ 3
Highi,t-1
(6)
+ 4
Controlsi,t-1
+ 1,i,j,t
,
however, flows are only observed if insurance companies and pension funds decided to
invest in the mutual fund or are not restricted from investing in this fund. This is the
case if the following condition is fulfilled:
0
+ 1
Performance Ranki,t-1

+ 2,i,j,t
> 0, (7)
where
1
 N(0, )
2
 N(0, 1)
Corr(1
, 2
) = .
The explanatory variables of the selection equation are past performance, measured by
the performance ranking over an evaluation period of 24 months, volatility also measured
over the past 24 months, and the age and size of the fund. Furthermore, dummy variables
indicating the investment objective and time dummies are included, but not reported. I
estimate the Heckman two equation model using maximum likelihood. Results for the
three different performance measures are displayed in Table 5.
The first column of each specification (FLOW) shows the flow-performance relation-
ship already estimated (Eq. 6). The second column of each specification (SELECT)
displays the results of the selection equation, the decision of the insurance companies
and pension funds on whether to invest in the fund (Eq. 7). The estimation results are
15
virtually the same as before. Insurance companies and pension funds show a tendency to
chase past performance, although not for all performance measures.
In the Heckman selection model a self-selection bias arises only if the correlation 
between the residuals of equation (6) and (7) is not equal to zero. As can be seen from
Table 5, the null hypothesis that  is equal to zero cannot be rejected on all conventional
significance levels. Thus, a separate estimation, as carried out before, delivers already
unbiased estimates.
Nevertheless, the selection equation provides some interesting insights. The probabil-
ity of insurance companies and pension funds investing in a mutual fund decreases if the
fund is a high performer. This result is in line with the avoidance of risk required by
the prudent-man principles. High volatility, on the other hand, has no significant effect
on the probability of insurance companies and pension funds investing in mutual funds.
Moreover, insurance companies and pension funds tend to invest in older and larger funds,
which can be interpreted as the fund having a long and good reputation, but it should
also be borne in mind that only a long record makes it possible for insurance companies
and pension funds to provide evidence of the security of the mutual fund to the regulator.
The positive coefficient for fund fees might also indicate that insurance companies and
pension funds see these funds as high quality funds. Or to put it differently: a high quality
fund, which has maybe even received a quality rating, is simply able to charge a higher
fee.
To quantify the effect of the explanatory variables on the probability of insurance
companies and pension funds investing in a mutual fund I provide marginal effects of a
Probit model. Since the residuals of the flow regression are uncorrelated with the residuals
of the selection regression, a two-part model, i.e. separately running a Probit model and
OLS regression, also yields unbiased results. Table 6 reports the marginal effects of the
Probit model evaluated at the mean of the explanatory variables.
In summary, insurance companies show signs of performance chasing, although regula-
tions seem to hinder them from investing in all mutual funds. Overall, the disaggregation
16
of the flow-performance relationship in their investor types supports the theory of Gruber
(1996) and Berk & Green (2004); however, the results provide no clear-cut evidence of
whether one group is punishing bad performance more severely. Only in some specifi-
cations do financial corporations show a significant flow-performance relationship in the
lower segment. These results should be interpreted with caution since the fund flows,
especially institutional flows, show very extreme values (see Table 2). The results of the
flow-performance regression could accordingly be driven by a few extreme flows. There-
fore, in the next section I will analyze the percentage holdings of investors. A difference
in the flow-performance relationship should also become apparent in the stock of shares
held by the different investor groups.
5 Mutual Fund Investor Composition
5.1 Investor Composition by Quintile
If all investors react in the same way to performance there should be no systematic dif-
ference in the percentage of shares held by investor groups in well or poorly performing
funds. In contrast, if there are sophisticated investors and disadvantaged investors, the
investor compositions for well and poorly performing funds should be different. Sophis-
ticated investors learn about managerial ability and will increase their flows into high
performing funds, which should consequently increase the percentage of shares held by
sophisticated investors in top performing funds. By the same token there should be an
increased percentage of disadvantaged investors in the worst performing funds.
In order to test this hypothesis I rank mutual funds according to their past performance
within their investment objective and form five quintiles. In each quintile I determine the
average size measured by the total net assets (TNA) of the fund and the average share
of each investor group. The results can be found in Table 7. The difference in means
between the groups is tested using a t-test. I test the differences between the top and
bottom quintile (5-1), the 5th and 4th quintile (5-4) and the 2nd and 1st quintile (2-1).
17
The worst performing funds (bottom quintile) are much smaller on average than the
better performing funds. Fund size increases with performance, but the top performing
funds are slightly smaller on average than the fourth quintile in two out of three cases.
This result is in line with the theoretical model by Berk & Green (2004), who argue that
there are economies of scale in managerial ability.
The percentage share held by households is slightly higher for the worst performing
funds than the top performing funds. This finding is in line with the previous results.
Households do chase returns to some extent, but, in addition, other factors such as ad-
vertising might play an important role in the fund selection process.
The previous finding for financial corporations can also be confirmed. Financial cor-
porations show the strongest tendency to chase past performance. The share of financial
corporations in the top performing funds is therefore 19 while the worst performing funds
only contain 13 percent on average (Panel A). Moreover, the difference between the top
quintile and the second best quintile is distinct. The share of financial corporations in-
creases by 6 percentage points from the 4th to the 5th quintile.
The group of insurance corporations and pension funds is clearly underrepresented
in the top performing funds, even though there is some evidence of performance chasing
for this investor group. Insurance companies and pension funds do not hold any shares
in many of the better performing funds, which results in the large difference in means
between the top two and the bottom three quintiles.
While this test shows distinct differences in investor composition between top perform-
ing funds and average funds, there is no clear difference between the worst performing
funds and average funds. Even though the average size of mutual funds decreases from
260 million to 182 million Euro from the second to the first quintile (Panel A), the investor
composition between the second and first quintile does not change considerably. Only the
difference in mean shares for households is statistically significant, when comparing the
second versus the first quintile. However, when testing against the 3rd or 4th quintile this
difference becomes insignificant (not reported). This result implies that the speed with
18
which households, financial corporations, and insurance companies and pension funds
leave the worst performing funds does not differ significantly.
5.2 Investor Composition: Robustness Checks
Since other factors might influence the percentage share held by one investor group I run
a multivariate regression as a robustness check. I construct a dummy variable Quintile 1
that is one if the fund's performance is in the first quintile and zero otherwise. Dummies
for the other quintiles are constructed in the same way.
Table 1 shows that the holding structure of mutual fund investors changed over time.
To account for the changing investor composition over time, I include time dummies as
a control in the regression. Furthermore, different investor groups might have different
preferences regarding the investment objective of the fund. This is controlled for by also
including dummies for the fund investment objective. Additional controls are the funds'
volatility, fees, size and age.
I run a regression of percentage shares of investor groups on the quintile dummies and
the mentioned controls. The omitted category is the 3rd quintile. Thus, the coefficients of
the dummy variables measure the difference relative to a fund with average performance.
The results are essentially the same as for the univariate test. Most importantly, financial
corporations hold a significantly higher share in the top performing funds than a fund with
average performance. The composition of the worst performing funds, in contrast, does
not systematically differ from the investor composition of the average fund. The finding
of the flow-performance regression that financial corporations punish poorly performing
funds more quickly is not confirmed when looking at the investor compositions. The
significant flow-performance relationship in the low segment is thus most likely driven by
only a few observations.
Furthermore, financial corporations seem to be less risk averse since their share is
greater in funds with higher volatility. In addition, younger funds have an increased share
of financial corporations as investors. One possible explanation is that financial corpo-
19
rations have better inside knowledge about the fund manager's ability and are therefore
willing to buy younger funds.
Looking at the investor composition of mutual funds provides an additional test for
the theory of Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004). While this test provides evidence
that sophisticated investors hold higher percentage shares in the best performing funds,
the test cannot detect any systematic difference in investor composition between the
worst performing funds and those with average performance. Thus, we do not observe
a "burnout", where sophisticated investors exit poorly performing funds first and only
disadvantaged and unsophisticated investors stay behind. The results are more in line
with Lynch & Musto (2003), who argue that investors do not respond to poor performance,
because they expect the management strategy or the management team to change.
6 Conclusion
Chasing past performance of mutual funds is often explained by asymmetric information
or behavioral arguments. Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004) provide an alternative
explanation for this phenomenon. Sophisticated investors rationally chase past perfor-
mance, because high past performance is a signal for managerial ability.
This paper provides a direct test of this theory by examining the flow-performance
relationship of different investor groups in German mutual funds. The findings overall
support the theory of Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004). Financial corporations,
arguably the most sophisticated investor group, have a strong tendency to chase past
performance. The group of households comprises both sophisticated investors, who chase
past performance, and unsophisticated investors, whose investment decision is driven by
advertising or status quo bias. Insurance companies and pension funds show signs of being
institutionally disadvantaged. There is some evidence that this investor group chases
past performance, but they are underrepresented in the best performing funds, probably
due to investment restrictions. Surprisingly, I find no significant difference between the
20
investor composition of the worst performing funds and those with average performance.
These results provide new insights into the investment decisions of different mutual fund
investors and the different flow-performance relationships of investor groups.

This table shows summary statistics of the mutual fund data set at the end of each year.
First, it shows the total number of funds and the number of funds in each investment
objective (Germany, Europe and Global). Second, it shows other averages of mutual fund
characteristics: TNA are the total net assets in million Euro. Expense ratio is the average
expenses per year divided by average total net assets. Total load includes front-end and back-

Table 4: Flow-Performance Relationship
This table shows the effect of past performance on total net flows and net flows separated by investor
type. All explanatory variables are lagged and, in addition, the regression includes time dummies
and dummies for the investment objective, which are not reported. Performance is measured by
Raw Return, Sharpe Ratio and Jensen's Alpha (Panel A, B and C) calculated over the past 24
months. Quarterly flows are regressed on low, mid and high performance ranges and controls.
Lagged flow is the flow of the previous quarter, volatility is measured as the standard deviation
over the performance evaluation period, total fee is the expense ratio plus 1/3 of total loads, size
is measured by the natural logarithm of assets and age is the natural logarithm of one plus age in
years. Robust standard errors clustered at the fund level are given in parentheses. *, **, and ***
indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level respectively.

Table 5: The Investment Decisions of Insurance Companies and
Pension Funds
This table shows the investment decision of insurance companies and pension funds estimated using a
Heckman selection model. The column FLOW indicates the flow-performance regression, where flows
of insurance companies and pension funds are regressed on performance measures (Low, Mid and High)
and controls. The control variables are defined as before (see Table 4). SELECT indicates the selection
equation that models whether insurances and pension funds decide to invest in a fund or not. Explanatory
variables for the selection equation are performance measured by the percentile rank and the control
variables as before. The model is estimated by maximum likelihood. Robust standard errors clustered
at the fund level are given in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1%
level respectively.

This table shows the marginal effects of a Probit regression of the decision whether
insurance companies and pension funds invest in a mutual fund or not. The dependent
variable is a dummy that is one if insurance companies and pension funds invested
in the mutual fund and zero otherwise. Explanatory variables are defined as before
(see Table 4). Marginal effects are evaluated at the mean. Robust standard errors
clustered at the fund level are given in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance

Table 7: Investor Composition by Performance
This table shows the average total net assets in million EUR (TNA) and the average share (as percentage
of total net assets) held by the three major investor groups. Funds were ranked within their investment
objective into quintiles by their prior 24-month Raw Return, Sharpe Ratio and Jensen's Alpha. Total
net assets are measured in million Euro, shares of the investor groups are in percent. Moreover, the
table displays the total average over the whole sample. In addition, it provides the differences in means
between the 5th and 1st quintile (5-1), the 5th and 4th quintile (5-4) and the 2nd and 1st quintile (2-1).
The p-values of a t-test of equality in means are given in parentheses.

Table 8: Investor Composition by Performance: Regression Results
This table shows the regression results of the share of depositor group on lagged performance and
lagged control variables. Quintile 1 is a dummy variable that is equal to one if the fund is in the
first performance quintile and zero otherwise. Quintile 2 - Quintile 5 are constructed in the same
way. The omitted category is the 3rd quintile. Volatility is measured as the standard deviation over
the performance evaluation period (24 months), total fee is the expense ratio plus 1/3 of total loads,
size is measured by the natural logarithm of assets and age is the natural logarithm of one plus age
in years. All specifications include time and investment objective fixed effects. Robust standard
errors clustered at the fund level are given in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at
the 10%, 5% and 1% level respectively.
