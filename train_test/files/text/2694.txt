Firearm Possession Among Adolescents Presenting
to an Urban Emergency Department for Assault
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Violence involving firearms is
a leading cause of death among US youth ages 14 to 24. The
emergency department is the primary medical setting for care of
assault-injured youth and an underused but important setting for
violence-prevention programs.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Among assault-injured youth seeking
emergency department care, firearm possession rates are high,
most obtained outside of legal channels. Higher rates of negative
retaliatory attitudes and substance use among those youth with
firearms increases risk of future lethal violence.
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Firearm violence is a leading cause
of death among youth. The objectives of this study were (1) determine
firearm possession rates and associated correlates among youth
seeking care for assault in an emergency department (ED); (2) un-
derstand differences in risk factors for youth with firearm posses-
sion; and (3) identify firearm possession characteristics in this
population: type, reason for possession, and source of firearms.
METHODS: Youth (14 to 24 years old) presenting to a Level 1 ED with
assault were administered a computerized screening survey. Validated
instruments were administered, measuring demographics, firearm
rates and characteristics, attitudes toward aggression, substance
use, and previous violence history.
RESULTS: Among 689 assault-injured youth, 23% reported firearm
possession in the past 6 months. Only 17% of those reporting
firearm possession obtained the gun from a legal source; 22%
reported ownership of highly lethal automatic/semiautomatic
weapons and 37.1% reported having a firearm for protection.
Logistic regression analysis identified significant correlates of
firearm possession, including male gender, higher socioeconomic
status, illicit drug use, recent serious fight, and retaliatory attitudes.
CONCLUSIONS: ED assault-injured youth had high rates of firearm
possession (23.1%), most of which were not obtained from legal
sources. Youth with firearm possession were more likely to have
been in a recent serious fight, and to endorse aggressive attitudes
that increase their risk for retaliatory violence. Future prevention
efforts should focus on minimizing illegal firearm access among
high-risk youth, nonviolent alternatives to retaliatory violence, and
substance use prevention. Pediatrics 2013;132:213­221

Homicideisthesecondleadingcauseof
death for all US youth aged 10 to 24
yearsoldandtheleadingcauseofdeath
for African American youth.1 In 2010,
firearms were responsible for 85% of
homicide-related deaths among ado-
lescents.1 US firearm homicide rates
are 19.5 times higher than other in-
dustrialized nations, with adolescent
(15­24 years old) firearm homicide
rates 42.7 times higher than children in
22 other developed nations.2­4 Data
from the National Violent Death Report-
ing System suggest that firearm-
related violence is most likely to occur
in familiar settings, with 47% of firearm
homicides occurring in a home, apart-
ment, or surrounding structure and 25%
occurring on local public streets.5
National medical organizations,6­8 in-
cluding the American Academy of Pe-
diatrics, recognize the importance of
violence prevention and have identified
assault-injured youth as a population
requiring urgent attention.9­11 In 2011,
.900 000 youth, ages 10 to 24, visited
the emergency department (ED) be-
cause of violence-related injury.12
Youth with assault-related injury are at
high risk for reinjury.13­18 Sims et al19
found violently injured youth admitted
to trauma units have readmission
rates as high as 44% due to assault and
20% mortality due to homicide over a
5-year follow-up; retrospective chart
reviews note similar rates.19­24
The ED is the primary medical setting
for injured adolescents,25­28 and an
important setting for violence-
prevention programs.29­33 Given high
rates of reinjury and potential for re-
taliatory violence, understanding the
rates and correlates of firearm pos-
session, past experiences with firearm
violence, and source and reason for
possession among high-risk assault-
injured youth is critical to inform pre-
vention efforts. Previous community-
based adolescent firearm prevalence
studies have focused primarily on high
school­based samples34­38 and may
neglect higher risk youth who do not
attend school.29,39,40 Previous ED-based
samples30,41 have focused on all ado-
lescents regardless of presenting com-
plaint, and lacked information about
firearm acquisition, type, or motivation
for possession. No previous studies
have focused specifically on firearm
possession among high-risk ED
assault-injured youth, a critical sub-
group to understand for future
violence-prevention initiatives.
Primary study objectives were (1) de-
termine the rate and correlates of fire-
arm possession among assault-injured
youth presenting to an inner-city ED; (2)
understand differences in risk factors
among these youth seeking care with
and without firearm possession; and (3)
identify firearm possession character-
istics in this population, including fire-
armtype,reasonforfirearmpossession,
and sources of firearms as a means to
inform intervention efforts around ille-
gal gun diversion.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This study presents screening data
collectedaspartofa2-yearlongitudinal
study focused on assault-injured youth
seeking ED care. Hurley Medical Center
is the only public hospital in Flint,
Michigan, and is the major Level-1
trauma center for the region, pro-
viding care for 75 000 adult and
25 000 pediatric patients annually.
Study procedures were approved by
the institutional review board for both
Hurley Medical Center and the Univer-
sity of Michigan; a National Institutes of
Health certificate of confidentiality was
obtained. Flint crime and poverty rates
are comparable to other urban cen-
ters, such as Detroit, Camden, and
Oakland.42 The study population re-
flects the population of Flint, Michigan,
which is 50% to 60% African Ameri-
can,43 and our study population
demographics are similar to previous
studies conducted among all present-
ing patients to this ED.44,45
Study Population
EDpatientsaged14to24years(February
2010­September 2011) presenting for
assault-related injury completed the
screening survey. Trained research
assistants (RAs) approached patients in
treatment areas. Exclusions included
sexual assault, child abuse, suicidal
ideation/attempt, or conditions pre-
cluding ethical consent (Fig 1). Youth
,18 years old unaccompanied by
a parent/guardian were excluded
(13.7%). Unstable trauma patients were
recruited on the inpatient floor if they
stabilized within 72 hours.
Study Recruitment
Assault-injured patientswere identified
through electronic patient logs. Re-
cruitment was 7 days per week; 21
hours per day on Tuesdays and
Wednesdays and 24 hours per day
Thursdays through Mondays.
Study Protocol
After providing written consent, patients
self-administered a computerized sur-
vey and received a $1.00 gift. The survey
was administered privately; family or
friends accompanying the patient were
not allowed to observe or participate
during administration and this was
monitored by the RA. The RA paused the
computer survey during medical eval-
uation orduring medical procedures to
ensure privacy and to avoid interfering
with medical care.
Outcome Measures
Firearm Possession
The dependent variable, firearm pos-
session,wasdefinedas guncarriageor
gun ownership within the past 6
months. All firearm questions and
responses were from the Tulane
214 CARTER et al
National Youth Study and excluded use
for hunting or sporting activities. Af-
firmative answers to any of the 5
questions were coded as possession of
a firearm.
Gun carriage was assessed with 3
questions: (1) frequency of gun carriage
outside the home; (2) reason for gun
carriage outside the home; and (3)
source of a handgun carried outside the
home.39,46,47 The response scale for fre-
quency of gun carriage was modified to
mirror the conflict tactics scale-2 (never,
1 time, 2 times, 3­5, 6­10, 11­20, more
than 20 times). Response choices for
reason for gun carriage outside the
home (Didn't carry a gun; Protection;
Holding it for someone; Used gun in
a crime; To scare someone; To get back
at someone; Most of my friends carry
guns) and source of handgun carried
outside the home (Didn't carry a hand-
gun; Given or loaned by a family mem-
ber, Snuck it from home; Given/loaned
from a friend; Paid cash for it; Traded
something for it; Stole it) were also used
to characterize gun-related activities.
Gun ownership was assessed with 2
questions:(1)typeofgunownedand(2)
source of a handgun paid for with cash.
An affirmative answer to either was
characterized as gun ownership. The
responsescalefor typeofgunowned(No
possession or ownership of a gun; Reg-
ular rifle; Automatic or semiautomatic
rifle;Regularshotgun;Sawed-offshotgun;
Revolver; Automatic or semiautomatic
handgun) and source of a handgun paid
for with cash (I didn't pay cash for the
handgun; Family member; Friend; Drug
addict; Drug dealer; Street dealer;
Pawnshop or gun shop; Asked someone
to buy it; Department or sporting goods
store) were further used to characterize
gun ownership. Illegal firearm access
was defined as any source other than
a department/sporting goods store or
gun shop/pawnshop. Descriptive ques-
tions were asked about the perceived
level of difficulty obtaining a handgun
and history of purchasing a firearm from
a legal or illegal dealer.39,46,47
Demographic Information
Age, gender, race, ethnicity, employ-
ment, and receipt of public assistance
were collected using measures from
the National Longitudinal Study of Ad-
olescent Health and National Institutes
of Health Drug Abuse Treatment Out-
come Study of Adolescents.48­51
Characterization of Assault Resulting
in Index ED Visit
Participants were asked about rela-
tionships (ie, spouse, girlfriend/
boyfriend, friend, stranger) and ag-
gressive behaviors (ie, threatened or
used a gun) in the altercation prompting
presentation. A modified Conflict Tactics
Scale (CTS)52 similar to the Timeline
FollowbackSpousalViolence Interview53
was used. This has excellent test-retest
reliability.53,54
Chart Review
Chart review data (admit/discharge)
were collected. Five percent of charts

A trained RA calculated injury severity
scores from ED chart data.56

Attitudes Toward Violence and
Revenge
Attitudes toward aggression were
assessedbyusingaretaliationsubscale
of children's perceptions of environ-
mental violence.57,58 Itemswere reverse-
coded (higher scores indicated more
willingness to endorse retaliation). A
mean summary score was created for
each participant and then all mean
summary scores were averaged for the
bivariate comparison.
Violence and Firearm-Related Violence
Previous 6-month violence measures
(serious physical fight, causing injury
requiring treatment) were from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-
cent Health.49,50 Gang affiliation was
assessed by using questions from the
Tulane Youth Study.39,46,47 Previous 6-
month intimate partner violence was
assessed with the revised CTS-2.59
Frequency of firearm-related aggres-
sion or victimization within the past 6
months was assessed by using the
modified CTS-2 response scale.
Substance Use
Past 6-month substance use, including
alcohol, illicit drug use (cocaine, meth-
amphetamine, inhalants, hallucinogens,
marijuana, or street opioids) and non-
medical prescription drug use was
assessed by using the Alcohol Use Dis-
orders Identification Test and Alcohol,
Smoking, and Substance Use In-
volvement Screening Tests.60­63 Binge
drinking was defined as 5 or more
drinks on 1 occasion in the previous 6
months. Substance use measures were
dichotomized. Using standard mea-
sures from the adolescent health sur-
vey49 with the modified CTS-2 response
scale, participants were also asked how
often they drank alcohol or used drugs
while carrying a weapon (gun or knife).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were computed
and bivariate analyses conducted
comparing gun possession (yes/no) in
relation to demographics, visit char-
acteristics, substance use, and vio-
lence. A logistic regression model was
constructed with firearm possession
(yes/no) as the outcome. Independent
variables were included in the model
based on theory and significance in the
bivariate analysis. Illicit drug use and
binge drinking were too highly corre-
lated to be included in one regression
model; therefore, given drug use was
more common in this population, it was
retained in the final model. Gang
membership, although included in the
descriptive analysis, was dropped from
thefinalmodel,asonly3%ofthesample
(n = 24 of 689) endorsed gang mem-
bership. There was no evidence of
multicollinearity in the final model.
RESULTS
During recruitment, 1581 assault-
injured patients (14­24 years old)
presented (Fig 1), most (84.5%) during
recruitment hours. Research staff
approached 92.2% of eligible patients
(n = 814); 689 (84.6%) completed the
survey. Refusals were more likely male
(18.0% vs 12.5%, P , .05) and less likely
African American (10.3% vs 17.1%, P ,
.01). No age differences were noted in
refusal rates. The institutional review
board did not allow collection of addi-
tional chart data from refusals. The
mean screen completion time was 30
minutes (SD = 17.5 minutes).
Rates of Firearm Possession
Among assault-injured youth, 23.1% (n
= 159) reported firearm possession
(Table 1) in the past 6 months. Among
those with firearms, 41.5% (n = 66)
reported carrying outside the home in
the past 6 months. Of participants with
firearms, 67.3% were seen for peer-
related violence and 14.5% for in-
timate partner­related violence; 3.4%
reported threatening someone with
a firearm during the altercation that
prompted the visit. Of those with fire-
arms, 4 (2.5%) reported an ED mental
health visit within the past year.
Bivariate Analysis
Participants with firearms were more
likelymale,lesslikelyAfricanAmerican,
and less likely to receive public assis-
tance (ie, higher socioeconomic status
[SES]). Of those with firearms, 14.5%
(n = 23) were younger than 18 and
32.1% (n = 51) have children.
Attitudes Toward Violence and
Revenge
Participants with firearms endorsed
higher mean levels of aggression and
retaliatory attitudes compared with
those without firearms (Table 1).
Among those with firearms, more be-
lieved "revenge was a good thing" (2.1
vs 1.9, P , .05) and that it was "ok to
threaten to hurt someone else if they
try to hurt you" (2.6 vs 2.3, P , .01) and
"ok to hurt people if they hurt you first"
(2.4 vs 2.2, P , .01).
Experience With Violence and
Firearm-Related Violence
Participants with firearms noted more
overall violent experiences in the pre-
vious 6 months (Table 1). They were also
noted to have higher rates of group
fighting (44.0% vs 25.3%, P , .001) and
gang membership (9.4% vs 0.9%, P ,
.001), although only 2.9% (n = 20) of the
overall sample (n = 689) endorsed gang
membership. Participants with fire-
arms were also more likely the victim or
the aggressor in firearm-related vio-
lence in the past 6 months (Table 1).
Substance Use Correlates of Firearm
Possession
Past 6-month binge drinking and illicit
drug use were positively associated
with firearm possession. Those with
firearms had higher rates of pre-
scription opioid use (19.5% vs 11.3%,
P , .01) and consumption of alcohol
216 CARTER et al
before a physical fight (33.3% vs 19.8%,
P , .01). They also reported using
substances while carrying a weapon
(gun or knife), with 16.4% reporting
alcohol use and 17.6% reporting drug
use at least once.
Firearm Types and Methods of
Acquisition of Firearms
Youth reported firearm possession
primarily for protection (37.1%), al-
though some note they were "holding it
for someone" (10.1%), or because their
"friends carry guns" (8.8%). Among
those carrying a gun outside the home,
respondents primarily reported access
to a handgun through either cash pur-
chase (17.7%) or receiving it from
a friend (17.1%). Only 17% (n = 27)
reported purchasing a handgun with
cash from a plausibly legal source
(department/sporting goods store or
pawnshop/gun shop), whereas the re-
mainder purchased the firearm illegally
(either from a clearly illegal source or
underagepurchasesfromalegalsource
[n = 2]) or did not endorse a method of
acquisition. More than half the sample
(51.6%)reportedthatit wouldbelittleor
no trouble to obtain a firearm.
Among the assault-injured youth in our
sample (Table 2), respondents were
noted to possess high levels of rapid-
fire weapons with 17.6% (n = 28) of
youth noting ownership of automatic
or semiautomatic weapons (rifles
or handguns). Of these youth with
automatic/semiautomatic weapons,
32.1% (n = 9) endorsed the view that
"revenge was a good thing," 14.3% (n =
4) reported that they carried a gun "to
scare someone" or "to get back at
someone," and 1 of these participants
had a mental health visit within the
past year at the site ED. Of those with
automatic or semiautomatic weapons,
only 5 (17.9%) reported acquiring them
from a clearly legal source.
Multivariate Logistic Regression
Analysis
In the multivariate logistic regression
model (Table 3), illicit drug use, past 6-
month serious fight, and high levels of
retaliatory attitudes were associated
with firearmpossession among assault-
injured ED youth. Male individuals and
those with higher SES status (ie, not
receiving public assistance) were
more likely to possess a gun. Age and
race were not significant predictors of
firearm possession.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to report firearm-
possession rates, associated risk
behaviors,andtocharacterizethetypes
of firearms and methods of firearm
acquisition among a consecutive, sys-
tematically obtained sample of high-
risk assault-injured youth presenting
to the ED. Results have implications for
firearm diversion policy as well as
hospital- and community-based ini-
tiatives to prevent potentially recurrent
lethal violence among assault-injured
youth.
Rates of firearm possession were no-
tably higher in our study than previous
EDstudies,likelyreflectingourfocuson
a high-risk sample of youth seeking
care for assault rather than general ED
patient populations.31,41,64 The high
rates of firearm possession in this

higher rates of retaliatory attitudes
and substance use, highlight the im-
portance of focusing ED and commu-
nity violence prevention interventions
among this subgroup. Most firearms in
our study were likely obtained illegally,
with almost a quarter of the sample
endorsing ownership of automatic/
semiautomatic weapons that are large-
clip, high rate-of-fire weapons, or may
be modified to these highly lethal
weapon types (ownership of guns for
target shooting or hunting was ex-
cluded). This, along with high carriage
rates (41.5%), suggests opportunities
for improved law enforcement around
firearm diversion and improved poli-
cies around weapon access among
high-risk youth.
Participants in our study, consistent
with school-based studies,65 endorsed
protection as a primary reason for
ownership. These school-based studies
found an association between carrying
firearms and exposure to community
violence.65 The perceived need to own
and carry firearms for protection
among respondents with assault injury
suggests a need to address youth's
perceived and real feeling of safety
through individual and community in-
tervention.
Although causality cannot be de-
termined because of the cross-
sectional nature of the study, among
an already high-risk group of assault-
injured patients, those with firearms
were more likely engaged in violent and
aggressive firearm-related activities
over the previous 6 months. They were
also more likely to have pulled a firearm
in a fight, shot or stabbed another per-
son,usedaguninafightwithanintimate
partner, or caused injury requiring
treatment than their peers without
firearms. It is important to note that few
youth were involved in a gang. Taken
together, these findings demonstrate
that even if the main reason youth
reported that they obtained a gun was
for protection, they are often both car-
rying and using the weapon. In combi-
nation with high rates of substance use
reported before the altercation, and
higher rates of substance use seen in
youth with firearms, this is particularly
concerning for inadvertently increasing
the risk of a firearm moving from
a protective device to impulsive use and
lethal outcomes.
Asinpreviousstudies,maleyouthwere
more likely to have firearm posses-
sion.39,41,64,66 It is important to note,
however, that 30% of youth with fire-
arms were female, highlighting the
need to include both genders in injury-
prevention efforts. Of note, and contrary
to previous ED studies, youth with
higher SES status were more likely to
own a gun.41,64 As would be hypothe-
sized, race was not predictive of firearm
possession. Overall, white males, not on
public aid seeking care forassault were
more likely to possess a gun than their
African American male counterparts
receiving public assistance.
Participantswithfirearmswerenotedto
have more aggressive attitudes com-
pared with those without firearms,
suggesting aggressive attitudes and
subsequent retaliation are major
contributors to violent firearm-related
injury. ED studies have shown that
assault-related injuries among youth
are often the result of long-standing
disagreements28 and that retaliation
may be an underlying cause for vio-
lence.67,68 These findings are important
because health behavior models,69
which are key to many violence-
prevention efforts, suggest the first
step to decreasing future aggression
would be to modify aggressive atti-
tudes.
Although peer violence was the source
of the altercation prompting medical
care in most cases, we found dating/
intimate partner violence was also
highly associated with firearm pos-
session. This finding is concerning for
escalation of future partner violence to
lethal means with the firearm they note
that they possess. Also, many of these
youth are parents themselves, raising
concern for the safe gun storage and
theneedtorestrictfirearmaccessfrom
their young children.

Our study finds higher rates of binge
drinking and other illicit drug use
among assault-injured patients with
firearms. In this regard, youth with
firearms, who are more likely to also be
binge drinking and/or using illicit
drugs,includingdrinkingbeforeafight,
increases concerns about potential
firearm discharge. Interventions ad-
dressing firearms among youth should
also assess and intervene for alcohol
and otherdrug use to decrease the risk
of harm with impulsive behavior that
may occur with youth and substance
use.
Several study limitations are noted. Al-
though our sample reflected the racial
composition of the city in which it was
located, future studies are needed with
samples containing other racial/ethnic
groups. Causal attributions are not
possible with a cross-sectional study
design and the single urban site limits
generalizability to other settings. Exclu-
sion of patients presenting for suicidal
ideation and acute sexual assault may
underestimate true firearm-possession
rates.Althoughapotentiallimitation,the
use of a self-report survey has been
showntohavehighreliabilityandvalidity
among adolescents for self-reported
risk behaviors, including alcohol and
drug use.70­77
These findings have implications for
injury-prevention efforts at the com-
munity and law-enforcement levels in
termsof thehighnumbers offirearms
obtained illegally, the ease of obtain-
ing illegal and highly lethal firearms,
including automatic/semiautomatic
weapons, diversion of legally obtained
firearms, as well as hospital ED­based
initiatives among assaulted youth
seeking care. Previous research has
demonstrated the immediate post-
injury time is an ideal time to capitalize
on a teachable moment with preventive
interventions.28,78 Previous ED screen-
ing, brief intervention, and referral to
treatment approaches have focused on
substance use,79­81 with a recent
study showing positive findings for
intervening for both substance use and
youth violence among younger less
violence-involved youth.45,82 Interven-
tions for hospitalized assault-injured
youth have shown promise linking hos-
pitalized youth with community-level
resources.17,30,83­86 Future ED-based
injury-prevention interventions or case
management approachesfor youth with
assault-related injuries may have the
potential to decrease the likelihood that
a youth who is seeking care today with
an assault-related injury will use a fire-
arm lethally or be a victim of firearm
violence.
