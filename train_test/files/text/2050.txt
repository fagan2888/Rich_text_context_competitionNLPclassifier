Indoor smoking bans in Bulgaria, Croatia, Northern
Cyprus, Romania and Turkey
J L Muilenburg,1 J S Legge Jr,2 A Burdell1
ABSTRACT
Background The purpose of this study was to examine
attitudes towards attempts to limit second-hand smoke
(SHS) in five Eastern European nations.
Methods The data consist of a Eurobarometer (64.3)
survey distributed from November to December 2005.
Logistic regression was employed to investigate support
levels for indoor smoking bans across the five political
units.
Results Across nations, there is more support for
smoking bans in offices and indoor work spaces and
indoor public space as opposed to restaurants and bars
and pubs. Personal smoking behaviours are linked
strongly with the smoking bans. Most importantly, it is
specific knowledge about the health dangers of smoking
which fosters support for indoor smoking bans.
Conclusion Policy implications suggest that government
and the media must disseminate accurate information
about the harm of smoking to broader segments of the
population to gain support for policies that affect the
dangers of SHS in these nations.
Eastern European nations have higher smoking
rates than their Western European neighbours;
similarly, countries in the East lag behind the West
in implementing smoking bans.1e5 The purpose of
this brief report is to assess support for bans on
indoor smoking in five nations with high levels of
tobacco use and comparatively few restrictions on
limiting second-hand smoke (SHS). These nations
are Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Turkey and the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
In Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Turkey, there
are complete smoking bans in healthcare, education
and government facilities. Theatres and cinemas
also ban smoking in these nations. The most
permissive smoking facilities include pubs and bars.
There are no restrictions in Romania and Turkey
while Bulgaria and Croatia have partial restrictions.
After 6 months of experimentation, Croatia
partially eased their smoking ban in cafes in
response to complaints from smokers and business
owners. There are complete bans in indoor work-
places and offices in Bulgaria and Croatia, but only
a partial restriction in Turkey and virtually no
restrictions in Romania.2 Despite these legal
restrictions, compliance and enforcement have
oftentimes been lax.6
METHODS
The data consist of a Eurobarometer (64.3) survey
distributed in November to December 2005.7 In
each nation, the sample design consisted of
a multistage random probability sample.7 The
survey research teams carried out a comparison
between the sample and the universe in each
nation. The universe description was based on
Eurostat population data or was drawn from
national statistical offices. For all countries, the
survey team used a national weighting procedure,
using marginal and intercellular weighting, based
on the universe description. The iteration procedure
took into account gender, age and size of locality.
We used the STATA V.10 subprogram SVY: Logistic
(regression) to adjust for the complexities of the
sampling design. This allowed the application of
sample weights for each nation. While the findings
are similar when the weights were not utilised, the
weighting procedure resulted generally in more
conservative estimates and probability levels for the
sample size. Further details on the universe sizes
can be obtained.6 The response rates are as follows:
Bulgaria (76.2%), Croatia (49.3%), Romania
(91.2%), Turkey (68.7%) and Northern Cyprus
(89.8%). For the dependent variables, respondents
were asked to express their support for bans on
smoking in one of four locations: restaurants; bars
or pubs; offices and other indoor workspaces; and
any indoor public space such as metros, airports
and shops. The specific question is, "Are you in
favour of smoking bans in the following places?"
The dependent variable originally consisted of
five categories (totally opposed to totally in favour);
however, an initial ordered logit analysis did not
meet the assumption of parallel regressions as
indicated by Brant tests in all equations. Thus, we
used a logistic regression analysis where 1¼totally
in favour or somewhat in favour, and 0¼totally
opposed, somewhat opposed or don't know.
For the explanatory variables, we first measured
country-specific effects with dummy variables that
were created for Bulgaria, Croatia, Northern
Cyprus and Turkey (1,0). Romania serves as the
reference (comparison) nation. Two binary vari-
ables were created for ex-smokers and non-smokers.
The reference category is current smokers. Five
possible responses (never to often) were utilised to
measure how often an individual was bothered by
exposure to tobacco smoke in their daily lives.
Assertiveness on SHS was measured by a five-
category question (also never to often) that queried
whether the respondent ever asked a smoker not to
smoke because it bothered him/her. Ideology was
captured in a 10-point question where high values
represented the right and low values represented
the left. Government role legitimacy in health was
tapped by a five-category question (totally disagree
to totally agree) that asked whether government
should "encourage people to eat a healthy diet and
take plenty of exercise". A satisfactory diet

Brief report
consisted of five categories (no, not good at all to yes, very good)
in answer to the statement "what I eat is good for my health".
General health was measured by five categories (very bad to very
good). We utilised a five-point question (totally disagree to
totally agree) to assess whether the respondent believed that
smoking "in the presence of a pregnant woman can be dangerous
to the baby". We used a binary variable to determine if the
respondent believed that SHS is "harmless" or "harmful". The
researchers constructed binary variables for gender, manual
worker and unemployment. Women, manual workers and the
unemployed were coded "1" with the remainder of the sample
coded as "0". We measured education by the total years spent in
school.
RESULTS
Table 1 lists the percentages of those "totally in favor" or
"somewhat in favor" of the smoking bans. Across nations, the
greatest level of support for the antismoking measures is found
concerning smoking in indoor workplaces and indoor public
spaces. There is much less support for smoking bans in restau-
rants and bars and pubs. Overall, Romania demonstrates the
least support for indoor smoking bans except for smoking bans
in bars and pubs, where the Croatians are less likely to be
supportive.
Table 2 shows the results of the four multivariable logistic
regressions. There is evidence of a strong, consistent nation-
specific effect, consistent with the results in table 1. Non-
smokers and ex-smokers are more amenable than current
smokers towards indoor smoking bans, with higher odds ratios
for restaurants and bars and pubs.
On three of the four dependent variables, being bothered by
SHS was associated with increased support for smoking bans.
More important is individual assertiveness concerning SHS; if
a respondent would ask a smoker not to smoke, the ORs are
from 1.27 to 1.34 times greater that they would support indoor
smoking bans of all types.

Brief report
Ideology was significant only in the case of smoking in offices
with those on the right somewhat less likely to support the ban.
Those who view government as having a strong role in health
are more likely to support the smoking bans across all categories,
except for the marginal 0.055 level of significance for indoor
spaces. Higher general health was associated with greater
support for smoking bans in restaurants and offices.
Knowledge of the general harmful effects of smoking and the
negative effects of SHS on pregnancies is strongly and consistently
related to increased support for the indoor bans.
The present analysis demonstrates no strong demographic
effects, with one exceptiondage; the older the individual, the
greater the support for bans in restaurants and bars.
DISCUSSION
The limitations of this study include the fact that the data on
smoking behaviour are self-reported. Given that tobacco use is
a somewhat sensitive social issue, there may be some impreci-
sion in the responses. In addition, the results can be generalised
only to the nations included in this study, which have a history
of high tobacco consumption.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the findings have impor-
tant implications for policy and practice. First, although
smoking is a huge public health problem among these nations,
there are important differences in support. Romania has the
largest problem in attaining acceptance of the bans. With the
exception of Croatia in the case of bars and pubs, support for the
indoor bans is stronger across every nation and for each depen-
dent variable. Nonetheless, it is important to note that there
was major support in each country for bans in restaurants, bars
and pubs, indoor workspaces, and indoor public places (the only
exception being support for smoke-free bars and pubs among
Croatians), and the support was greater than 70% in 13 of the 20
combinations of locations and country (see table 1). These
findings should be advertised to the general population, and to
policy makers and other key opinion leaders.
Second, as has been well-documented in the literature, indi-
viduals' attitudes are associated with their own smoking
behaviour.8 9 Smokers are less supportive of bans that limit
their behaviour. Those who reported better health in general are
more supportive of smoking bans.10 Further, younger respon-
dents are less likely to support smoking bans than older
respondents.11e16
The best potential for increasing support for indoor smoking
bans appears to be respondents learning about the harmful
effects of SHS.17e19 The analysis has demonstrated that indi-
viduals who know about the harmful effects of SHS are more
apt to support bans on indoor smoking than others. Media and
government must disseminate accurate information on the
health effects of SHS if there are to be substantial changes in
behaviour. Current efforts include those by the World Health
Organization in these nations that encourage utilisation of
primary care providers, advocate strong leadership in commu-
nity and government organizations, and media campaigns to
relay information that will increase knowledge and decrease
smoking.20 This information will continue to compete against
strong cultural norms that encourage smoking in these Eastern
European nations.

What this paper adds
< Many studies of tobacco control policies demonstrate that
demographic variables are associated with support for such
policies. Age, gender, class, education and employment
status have been strong predictors of support for antismoking
policies and tobacco use in general.
< In this analysis of indoor smoking bans in Bulgaria, Croatia,
Northern Cyprus, Romania and Turkey, demographic variables
are of little importance. Instead, knowledge of the potentially
harmful effects of tobacco emerges as the more important and
consistent explanation of support for these policies. Our
findings suggest that public health practitioners in these
nations should focus on widely disseminating accurate
information on the health effects of second-hand smoke.
