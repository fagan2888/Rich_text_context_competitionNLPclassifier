Abstract
Payers are demanding that US health care become more accountable and integrated, posing new demands for physicians
and the organizations that partner with them. We conducted focus groups with 30 physicians in a large integrated delivery
system who had previous experience practicing in less integrated settings and asked about skills they need to succeed in
this environment. Physicians identified 3 primary skills: orienting to teams and systems, engaging patients as individuals and
as a panel, and integrating cost awareness into practice. Physicians also expressed a high level of trust that the system was
designed to help them provide better care. This belief appeared to make the new demands and mental shifts tolerable, even
welcome, standing in contrast to research showing widespread physician distrust of their institutional settings. Physicians'
new skills and the system features that promote trust are described in the article and should be a focus for systems
transitioning to a more integrated, accountable model.

Introduction
Public and private payers are demanding that health care
organizations in the United States become more accountable
for quality and total costs of care. Many stakeholders have
set goals around the proportion of health care payments that
should be "value-based" in the near future.1-3 Nearly all types
of value-based payment programs--including capitation,
bundling, shared savings, pay-for-performance, and so on--
encourage greater collaboration among providers than gener-
ally exists today.At the same time, physicians are increasingly
choosing employment in larger, more organized settings, as
opposed to solo or small-group practices. This is due in part
to hospitals purchasing physician practices,4 and in part to
physicians choosing the stability and work-life balance that
larger employers can provide.5-7
If these trends continue, health care organizations will
increasingly resemble integrated delivery systems, defined
as "network[s] of organizations that provide . . . a coordi-
nated continuum of services to a defined population and [that
are] willing to be held clinically and fiscally accountable
for the outcomes and the health status of the population
served"8 (see also Suter et al9 for a more detailed definition
of the properties of integrated care and Valentijn et al10 for a
proposed taxonomy of levels of integration). Such a shift
will likely pose new demands for physicians and for organi-
zations that educate, certify, employ, or partner with them.11
We can learn from existing integrated delivery systems--
such as Kaiser Permanente, the Mayo Clinic Health System,
and Geisinger Health System--about how physicians adapt
to working in these settings. In this study, we asked physi-
cians about their transitions from a less integrated to a more
integrated setting. Physicians' accounts of such transitions
may reveal specific skills or attitudes they need to be effec-
tive and satisfied in the latter environment. This is potentially
important for several reasons. First, studies of change
management in health care often identify physician buy-in as

a key factor in determining whether organizational initiatives
succeed.12-14 Second, many studies have described physi-
cians' dysfunctional relationships with their care settings,
including accounts of systemic distrust between physicians,
administrators, and other providers15,16; physician burnout17;
physicians' perceptions that they must be hypervigilant to
protect patients against unsafe hospital conditions18,19; and
the "hidden curriculum" embedded in physician education
that teaches them to distrust their care systems.20,21
Currently, we have limited understanding of how physicians
fare when they transition into more integrated delivery settings.
Studies have focused on physicians' attitudes about specific
aspects of practice, such as care management processes, com-
pensation, workload, use of electronic medical records, or per-
formance measurement.22-26 Studies of differences across
practice settings tend to focus on comparing employed versus
independent physicians27,28 or looking broadly at physicians'
experiences working in managed care.29,30
Experts have opined about how to support the movement
toward integrated care,31,32 but the field lacks a nuanced view
of the day-to-day challenges and opportunities physicians
face as their practice environments change. Leaders of inte-
grated delivery systems commonly observe that the culture
of these systems is simply different from other environments,
with some referring to a culture of "group accountability"33
or of "continuous improvement."34 To our knowledge, how-
ever, no study has identified front-line physicians who have
worked in integrated and non-integrated settings and asked
them to articulate what those differences are.
Study Data and Methods
We conducted a qualitative descriptive study of how physi-
cians experience the transition to working in an integrated,
accountable system.35 We held focus groups in Fall 2015
with 30 physicians who came to work at one particular inte-
grated delivery system--Kaiser Permanente--after having
trained and practiced in other settings. Kaiser Permanente,
headquartered in Oakland, California, is the nation's largest
not-for-profit, integrated delivery system, with 11.3 million
patients and over 21,500 physicians in 8 states and the
District of Columbia.36 Kaiser Permanente is a mutually
exclusive partnership and contractual alliance between a not-
for-profit insurer, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan; a not-
for-profit hospital system, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals; and
8 physician professional organizations, the Permanente
Medical Groups.37 In each of Kaiser Permanente's geo-
graphic regions, the Health Plan offers coverage, and the
associated Medical Group provides professional services for
a negotiated per-member fee. Individual physicians are paid
by salary with modest performance incentives.37 The focus
of our study is the Southern California Permanente Medical
Group (SCPMG). Together with their health plan and hospi-
tal partners, SCPMG's nearly 7300 physicians serve over 4.2
million patients across Southern California.
An interdisciplinary research team with expertise in cul-
tural anthropology and health policy conducted a total of
four 90-minute focus groups, each at a different site within
the Kaiser Permanente Southern California region. Two
groups had 6 physician participants each; 2 had 9 partici-
pants each. Participating physicians had 3 to 13 years of
experience with SCPMG and came to the group after having
previously practiced outside of Kaiser Permanente for at
least 1 year. Most came from non-integrated care settings.
The sessions focused on the differences physicians
observed between SCPMG and their previous workplaces
and were designed to elicit answers to 2 primary questions:
What new skills, behaviors, and attitudes (if any) did physi-
cians have to develop in this new context, and how should
training and certification organizations prepare and support
physicians to thrive in this type of setting? (See the appendix
for the full interview guide.) All 4 groups also addressed
spontaneously 2 additional questions, without prompts from
the researchers: What organizational features of the system
itself enabled physicians to practice successfully in this envi-
ronment, and what were the tradeoffs inherent in those orga-
nizational features?
We chose 3 years as the minimum tenure because that is
the point at which physicians become full partners in the
practice, indicating (to us) that participants had made an
affirmative decision to remain at SCPMG, at least for the
near future. Across the groups, participants appeared diverse
in terms of age, race/ethnicity, and gender (11 women, 19
men). There were 16 primary care physicians and 14 special-
ists. Nineteen participants had spent between 3 and 6 years at
SCPMG, and 11 had spent between 7 and 13 years there.
Using human resource records, we identified all physi-
cians associated with each site who met the study criteria and
emailed them an invitation to participate. We also placed a
recruitment announcement in a weekly SCPMG electronic
newsletter. We offered participants an honorarium of $250.
The same 2 members of our research team (BC and LT),
neither of whom is a Kaiser Permanente employee, moder-
ated all 4 focus groups. The moderators asked all questions
in the interview guide of all participants, in every group, fol-
lowing the natural flow of conversation to ask questions in
combination or in different sequence, where appropriate. We
took detailed notes during the sessions and transcribed audio
recordings.
A larger team of 4 (BC, LT, JL, SD) analyzed all notes and
transcripts using the constant comparative method,35 begin-
ning with a set of a priori codes based on the interview ques-
tions and constructs, and then identifying new codes and
themes in an inductive manner as they emerged through
reading and comparison. We used Excel to organize and code
all data. Our conceptual framework for analyzing the data
was one of iterative, reflexive sifting for meaning making.38
We searched the data both for the answers to our pre-existing
questions and for the new questions and ideas present in our
participants' narratives, with a particular focus on how our
Chesluk et al 3
participants themselves interpreted the experiences they
described. Finally, we compared team members' individual
analyses with each other and with the original interview data,
in an iterative manner, to refine and verify codes and themes.
All focus group participants gave written informed con-
sent. The SCPMG Institutional Review Board approved the
methods for the study (approval no 10796).
Results
We divide the results into 4 categories. The first 2 are related
to questions we asked the participants explicitly: What new
skills, behaviors, and attitudes did physicians need to develop
in the new context, and how should training and certification
organizations prepare and support them to thrive in this envi-
ronment? The second 2 categories of results are related to
issues that all 4 focus groups brought out spontaneously:
What organizational features enable physicians to practice
successfully in this environment, and what are some trad-
eoffs inherent in those organizational features?
New Physician Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities
Physicians identified 3 primary areas of knowledge, skills,
and abilities they needed to acquire when they transitioned to
this medical group: orienting to the team and system, engag-
ing patients as individuals and as a panel (ie, as a group under
the care of a single clinician or team), and integrating cost
awareness into practice.
Orienting to team and system. Nearly all physicians described
the need to be oriented to the larger team and the system in
ways that were different from their experiences in other work
settings. For example, physicians said they needed to work
with support staff over whom they could not assert direct
authority. Several were initially dismayed about this. As one
physician said, "On day one . . . I went to ask a medical assis-
tant something and they said to me, `Oh, ask so-and-so
because I'm on lunch.' And the concept of . . . `lunch' and
`breaks' was astounding to me" (Group 1, Participant 5).
Physicians also described the need to accept input from
administrators--input that had been absent or easy to dis-
miss in other settings. One said, "Before, I didn't have a
boss. If [hospital administrators] tried to be too controlling,
we'd take our business elsewhere. Here, the administration
sets goals. They're not outrageous goals though" (Group 4,
Participant 2).
Finally, physicians talked about needing to focus on orga-
nizational goals and practice guidelines, even if their value
was not immediately apparent. As one said (and many others
seconded),
There's a thing known as "KP medicine," which is value-driven.
It's got some constraints. [You ask,] "Who are they to tell me
how to practice?" But over time, you get used to it and buy into
it. . . . At first, you don't understand the limits, because they're
different from what you [experienced] with outside insurance
companies. You learn the evidence base behind it, and it's
cohesive. (Group 2, Participant 4)
Physicians also said they needed to accept limits on their
autonomy, acknowledging they were part of a larger organi-
zation that holds collective responsibility for patients.
However, they did not characterize this as an abrogation of
individual "ownership" of their panel; rather, they needed to
recognize that they were not the only ones responsible for
their patients. One said,
This isn't really your patient. This is Kaiser's patient. And we've
got to make sure that we're doing everything efficiently and
correctly. . . . Whereas, you know, in the private world [it's],
"I'm the doctor. I admitted the patient. I'm giving the hospital
business. And I'm taking care of the patient the best I know
how." (Group 1, Participant 6)
They observed that this might not be equally easy for all
physicians. As one said, "If the [physician] . . . has to be in
charge of everything, and the only way things happen is their
way, they don't belong in a system like this" (Group 2,
Participant 6). Another simply said, "If you want to be a
`cowboy,'this is not the place to be" (Group 2, Participant 2).
Engaging patients as individuals and as a panel.Physicians
described several ways in which they had learned to work
differently with patients. First, they paid closer attention to
their patients' experiences of care. Many health systems rou-
tinely survey patients; what was notable in this medical
group was physicians' perception that they would be held
accountable for their patients' experiences.
Second, they had to view their relationship with patients
in the context of organizational goals, such as preventive
care targets for an entire patient panel. One primary care
physician recounted,
When I first started working here, I was amazed at the proactive
nature of the "care gaps." I would see a patient with a 103
[degree] fever, but I would still do a diabetic foot exam because
it was due. Sometimes it's uncomfortable, but sometimes it
seems appropriate. (Group 2, Participant 1)
On the same topic, several talked about new panel-
management skills and tasks they had to master. The same
physician quoted above said, "You have to manage a panel.
It means phone calls to them. It means letters. It means . . .
encouraging them to go for all their routine health mainte-
nance things" (Group 2, Participant 1).
Integrating cost awareness into practice. Many discussed need-
ing to understand the costs associated with the care their
patients receive. They said costs had been ignored in medical
school and residency, and if they had learned about this issue
4 INQUIRY
in previous work settings, it was with an emphasis on maxi-
mizing volume and billing, rather than value. In this system,
they said, they needed to be aware of their patients' costs for
treatments they prescribed, so that they could know when,
for example, a patient would need to spend a significant
amount over what insurance would cover.
Physicians also said they needed to understand the cost of
care to the larger organization, so that they could act respon-
sibly as stewards of the system's resources. As one said,
"When you work in a system like this, all of a sudden [cost]
becomes very important. Looking at it more from the sys-
tem's point of view . . . it's also important to you to know that
we're not paying for procedures that are not necessary or
being duplicated or whatever" (Group 1, Participant 1).
Changes to Medical Education
We asked what medical schools and residency programs
should do differently (if anything) to prepare physicians for
integrated care. Participants' answers reemphasized the
above findings--system orientation, patient engagement,
panel management, and especially what they glossed as
"business fundamentals," including integrating cost con-
sciousness into practice. One observed, "What medical
schools need to incorporate is more of a systems approach. .
. . How [do] you work as one part of a team where, as the
physician, you may not be the captain of the ship?" (Group 1,
Participant 3). Regarding panel management, another com-
mented, "Traditional [physician] education is based on treat-
ing patient[s'] symptoms, and they get better or they don't.
[Here], you're responsible for a panel of patients, whether
they come to see you or not. You are still responsible for
them" (Group 2, Participant 1).
Physicians identified 2 reasons why these programs
should focus on "business fundamentals." First, knowledge
about costs can help physicians understand and support an
organization's business decisions. One said, "Understanding
the business aspects gives me more understanding and own-
ership of [the organization's] policies and financial deci-
sions" (Group 3, Participant 8). Second, learning about the
business of medicine could make trainees aware of the dif-
ferent types of practice settings that exist in the United States,
allowing them to make an informed choice about where to
work. Participants felt they could have benefited from being
aware of the possibility of working in an integrated system
earlier in their career.
System Features That Support Acquisition of New
Skills
As noted, many participants offered unsolicited descriptions
of system features that engendered their trust and made them
willing (possibly even eager) to acquire the new skills. These
included structures supporting collaboration and learning
among colleagues, structures supporting evidence-based
medicine and panel management, and compensation based on
salary and capitation instead of volume and fee-for-service.
Collaboration and learning.Physicians described working in
an information-rich environment relative to their previous
work settings. The health system's well-developed electronic
health record (EHR) allowed them to access and share infor-
mation about their patients' histories and interactions with
other providers. One said, "I just love how everything's all in
one system. . . . I'm not having to make phone calls to talk to
[a patient's] outside primary care doc. I just look it up"
(Group 4, Participant 4).
Physicians enumerated other mechanisms for collabora-
tion. Rather than being incentivized to refer patients to spe-
cialists, physicians said they were encouraged to consult
with specialists themselves. The system offered several tools
for this, including a mechanism embedded in the EHR that
allows doctors to query specialists in near real-time, tools for
sharing images with dermatologists via the EHR, and a spe-
cialized hotline for primary care physicians to speak to an
on-call orthopedist. Physicians said they valued the ready
availability of specialist advice and noted the contrast with
what they had experienced elsewhere. One primary care phy-
sician said, "I . . . got [a response from a specialist] within ten
minutes one time. By the time I was finished charting, it was
there" (Group 4, Participant 3).
Physicians also described receiving meaningful clinical
feedback from other physicians and administrators.
Surprisingly to the research team, they said this feedback felt
appropriate and helpful, not intrusive, as illustrated by this
exchange:
Physician: When you go to put in the referral [to a spe-
cialist], a screen will pop up. . . . It'll actually give
you some information of common treatments or
common labs to order, or scans, or what the patient
might need.
Discussion leader: And do you find that helpful?
Physician: Oh, yes!. . . . And then, you know, you'll get a
note sometimes back in the chart [from the specialist,
saying], "Hey, saw this patient. . . . This is what we did.
. . ." So you can reflect on, hey, was there something I
could've done a little bit more? . . . And sometimes you
might even get a staff message . . . from the specialist
who's reviewing your referral [saying] "Hey, these are
some things you can do for the patient right now." . . .
[In other settings], all you'll hear is "Thank you for the
interesting consult." (Group 4, Participant 6)
Supports for evidence-based medicine and panel manage-
ment. Physicians described many ways that the system sup-
ported them in managing patient panels and practicing
evidence-based medicine (although most did not use the lat-
ter term), including a department that summarizes evidence
Chesluk et al 5
and develops recommendations for new medications and
technologies. One said,
Here we have a whole department that just analyzes [new
laboratory tests and technologies . . . They] review all the
literature, and they have epidemiologists, and PhDs, and MDs. .
. . It's a great resource. (Group 1, Participant 3)
Physicians also said they appreciated the numerous goal-
tracking and panel-management tools in the EHR to help
them know whether they are meeting care goals for individ-
ual patients and for their panels.
Salary and capitation.Physicians described benefits of
working in a system of capitated payments and salaried
physicians: primarily, that the system's financial incen-
tives were aligned with providing effective care, not max-
imizing volume of services. One said, "The common goal
is `take good care of the patient.' Financial motivation is
out of the picture" (Group 4, Participant 7). Another said,
"Previously . . . I was encouraged to see as many [patients]
or code as highly as I possibly could, to make money for
the group. [H]ere, we're actually encouraged to give qual-
ity care" (Group 4, Participant 4). They said this enhanced
their sense of providing the best care possible to their
patients.
Tradeoffs
At the same time, physicians described tradeoffs inherent in
all these system features. For example, the focus on preven-
tion and population-based care largely aligned with physi-
cians'own goals, but it could also sometimes feel intrusive in
its requirements to "push" certain care. One noted,
There's no way to put [on a patient's chart] "forget about the
mammogram and leave her alone about the pap smear." Even if
you were to write it in: "doesn't want [a mammogram]," it
doesn't matter because they're still going to be caught in the
computer data mining that [says], "this person hasn't had a
mammogram." (Group 2, Participant 1)
The large size of the organization and some of its bureau-
cratic features, including reliance on unionized workforces,
provided a sense of stability and freed physicians from has-
sles such as hiring and payroll. However, they acknowledged
that change can feel slow in such a large organization. One
said, "The responsiveness to change is significantly slower
here. . . . There are multiple layers and multiple levels that
have to check off on change here. For better or for worse, [in]
smaller groups, you would get a new idea and you'd just do
it" (Group 3, Participant 8).
Regarding financial incentives, participants agreed that
physician salary and group capitation greatly encouraged a
focus on patients' needs and the "right" amount of care.
However, several noted that salary might lead some col-
leagues to be slow to respond to referrals.
Participants largely regarded these tradeoffs as "worth
it," with the downsides often described with humor, as
something to tolerate as part of a bigger, more positive
picture. For the research team, the fact that physicians
acknowledged these inherent tradeoffs reinforced the
impression that they trust their system and believe its inter-
ests align with their own.
Discussion
Systems That Earn Physicians' Trust
Because our primary focus was on physicians' knowledge,
skills, and abilities, we expected to hear about issues such as
learning new approaches to collaboration and panel manage-
ment, or learning to accommodate system-set rules or guid-
ance. We did not expect to gather data on how the system had
earned physicians' trust, making them amenable to develop-
ing these new competencies. This trust in the system contrasts
with what we have seen in the literature and in our previous
work in non-integrated settings, where physicians often view
the "system" as something they must work around to provide
good patient care and where attempts to influence what physi-
cians do are rare and unwelcome when they occur.18 Our par-
ticipants described ways the system supported them to
provide a different, better kind of care. This was not some-
thing most had consciously sought when coming to SCPMG.
Rather, most said they had come to this group for reasons
other than care quality--primarily, for work-life balance and
financial stability. But having sought personal balance and
stability, they discovered a system that resonated with their
own values and priorities for patient care.
For some, this experience effected a change in those val-
ues and priorities. The new work setting demanded different
skills and attitudes than had been required elsewhere, and
putting those into practice in the context of an integrated sys-
tem redefined their perspective on what being a physician
entailed. They were able to accomplish things with their
teams and for their patients that would not have been possi-
ble, or even conceivable, in other settings. A good example
of this is the dynamic one physician described in which he
appreciated receiving feedback from a specialist about his
referral decision because it would help him make the most
appropriate referrals in the future.
Participants' new perspectives on the nature of the physi-
cian's job may be particularly relevant to nascentAccountable
Care Organizations (ACOs), and they appear to lend cre-
dence to common strategies ACOs have used to affect physi-
cian behavior. In particular, Phipps-Taylor and Shortell
recently found that the most common change motivators
ACOs used with their physicians were opportunities to have
a greater impact on patients and to be a more effective
physician.39
6 INQUIRY
The experience of transitioning to work in this integrated
system carried with it a change in what anthropological the-
ory terms worldview and ethos--in how physicians envision
the world and what good conduct in that world should
entail.40 This cultural reframing seems to arise from the
gestalt of the system features described above, which align
closely with the criteria for integrated care proposed by
Shortell and Gillies,8 Suter et al,9 or Valentijn et al.10 The
system features mentioned by group participants function
not just to support care providers but to enable this new cul-
tural framework as well.
This is underscored by our participants' references to the
importance of physicians' acceptance of teamwork and lim-
its on traditionally defined professional autonomy. Seen
from the perspective taught implicitly and explicitly to phy-
sicians in training,20,21 limits on autonomy would normally
be framed in terms of loss--privileges and affordances made
unavailable by the constraints of this integrated care system.
But unfettered autonomy can also be understood as an aspect
of physician practice and culture best left behind, a symptom
of deficient systems--a bug, not a feature.
That said, in analyzing data such as these, we must avoid
idealizing integrated systems. As discussed below (see the
Remaining Questions section), surely there are some physi-
cians who have chosen to exit this system or others like it;
understanding their reasons for doing so could prove illumi-
nating. In addition, research on physicians in integrated sys-
tems has described their need to negotiate unhelpful
information technology and bureaucracy, just like physicians
in other settings.41 Still, our participants' accounts of what
they had to accustom themselves to in this new setting paint
a telling portrait that differs sharply from the default nature
of health care practices they had experienced previously:
reactive, information poor, uncoordinated, and when it
comes to cost and efficiency, haphazard at best and driven by
counterproductive incentives at worst.
Implications for Training and Standard Setting
Our study has implications for medical schools and for
funders of Graduate Medical Education. Consistent with pre-
vious research,42 physicians said their education had ignored
topics such as system orientation, patient engagement, panel
management, and business fundamentals. We do not suggest
that these should be layered on top of existing curricula--
this would merely add to the already-great volume of infor-
mation that medical trainees must absorb. Rather, to the
extent possible, physician training should incorporate these
concepts organically, so that they are seen as fundamental to
delivering care, as in the movement to include cost aware-
ness in resident education.43,44
Our findings also have implications for organizations
that set standards for physicians and support their ongoing
professional development. Medical specialty societies and
other providers of continuing medical education should
consider how they might emphasize several specific skills
and attributes. The first is system-based practice, including
the ability to work within limits and toward goals set by the
larger organization. The second is inter-professional team-
work, encompassing collaboration with both face-to-face
and virtual teams. The third is patient centeredness, mean-
ing understanding and facilitating patients' pathways
through the care system, as well as understanding what care
costs patients. Specialty societies and certification and
licensing boards might wish to consider developing stan-
dards to assure that physicians have achieved and maintain
competency in these areas.
Remaining Questions
We found an unusually high degree of trust among these phy-
sicians that their system is designed to help them practice
good medicine. This trust seemed rooted in physicians'sense
that the organization's goals aligned with their own goals for
patient care. While we cannot comment on causation, we do
know that this medical group's leadership expends signifi-
cant effort to ensure physicians understand and buy into
organizational goals. One way they promote this is through a
multi-day program for new hires that focuses on what the
organization expects from physicians and what they can
expect in return. Program leaders report they intend to lay the
groundwork for physicians to develop the trust in the system
our participants described.
Another feature of this medical group that may contrib-
ute to the level of trust we observed is its representative
governance. Each partner may vote for a member of the
Board of Directors from his or her geographic area. Board
candidates are self-nominated and must win the support of
their colleagues.
This group's unique payment structures (group-level cap-
itation and individual physician salary) may also have con-
tributed to the trust we observed. As noted, several
participants mentioned that the system's financial incentives
were aligned with their own preferences for doing what is
best for the patient, rather than simply maximizing the vol-
ume of services. Some experts argue that ACOs and similar
entities will inevitably fail if they do not take bolder steps
toward capitation.45
The role played by this system's unique features--includ-
ing onboarding programs, representative governance, and
capitation/salary--merits further study. It will also be impor-
tant to explore whether physicians in other established inte-
grated delivery systems express similar views, as well as
whether the observed level of physician trust in this system
is evident in other, similar systems.
Further research could also compare our findings with
those from a group of SCPMG physicians with no previous
experience outside of the system. Is this group's apparent level
of satisfaction related to our participants' having worked in
other settings that they chose to leave? Would we see similar
results with physicians who started practicing in a highly inte-
grated setting straight out of residency? Answers to these
Chesluk et al 7
questions could have implications for the hiring of physicians
by nascent integrated delivery systems. In addition, research
with physicians who have left, or were asked to leave, Kaiser
Permanente or integrated systems to work in another type of
setting could illuminate other aspects of physicians' experi-
ences in these settings and what leads physicians to feel such a
setting is "right" for them as a professional.
Finally, further research could explore the perspectives on
similar questions held by non-physician providers, manag-
ers, administrators, and patients.
Limitations
This study includes only a limited number of physicians from
a specific region of a single, and very unique, health system.
Hypotheses about how our findings could apply more broadly
are therefore speculative. We sought to mitigate this limitation
by focusing on topics that are relevant for every integrated
practice setting (eg, supports for evidence-based medicine),
rather than specific to this particular system (eg, full vertical
integration among physicians, hospitals and health plan, or
having a 70-year history of organizational stability).
Focus groups have inherent limitations: We gathered
qualitative data from a limited number of participants, cover-
ing topics they felt comfortable broaching in a semi-public
setting. Our data consist of these particular physicians'recol-
lections and perceptions of their previous work settings and
their adaptation to their current one; these may not be com-
prehensive and accurate. We sought to address these limita-
tions by systematically comparing participants' perceptions
for consistency. Research with a broader, representative sam-
ple (eg, a survey) would be a useful supplement to our find-
ings; however, such a survey was beyond the scope of the
project. Furthermore, we sought a more in-depth interaction
with participants than would have been possible with a sur-
vey and chose our methodology accordingly, knowingly giv-
ing up some amount of generalizability for a richer analysis
of our particular participants' experiences.
In addition, the study included only physicians who had
worked or trained elsewhere, then chose to work at SCPMG,
remained there for 3 years, became partners, and volunteered
to participate in our study. Other physicians--for example,
those who left SCPMG or were asked to leave before 3 years,
or who came there straight from residency--may have differ-
ent perspectives, particularly on the system features that are
needed to support effective practice in an integrated system.
Finally, several members of the study team are Kaiser
Permanente employees, potentially introducing bias.
However, the interview questions were designed to elicit
neutral perspectives, and the interviews were conducted
and attended only by team members (including the lead
researcher) who are not Kaiser Permanente employees--a
point that was made clear to participants. The participant
information sheet also outlined the study's procedures for
keeping information confidential from SCPMG leadership.
Conclusion
According to physicians with experience both in and outside
of an integrated health care delivery system, practicing in an
integrated system requires a distinct set of competencies and
attitudes, including a team orientation, a willingness to
embrace larger organizational goals, and the ability to partici-
pate in proactively managing a patient panel. In the case of
SCPMG, these new competencies and attitudes were accom-
panied by feeling meaningfully supported by a trusted net-
work of peers, teammates, and a robust information and
resource infrastructure. Physicians described how this system
had earned their trust and enabled them to practice a different,
better kind of medicine than what had been possible else-
where. This has implications for physicians who practice in
integrated delivery systems, for organizations that train and
certify physicians and other providers, and for delivery sys-
tems striving to provide more accountable, integrated care.
Appendix
SCPMG Focus Group Script
Hello and thanks for attending this evening. My name is Ben
Chesluk. We're here together to learn about your experience
of coming to work in an integrated health system like Kaiser
Permanente.
You are here because you are all physicians who came to
work at Kaiser Permanente after earlier work experience and
training in other organizations. We'd like to learn about your
experience of that transition, to hear your perspectives on
what you find similar or different about working in an inte-
grated health system compared to other settings where
you've worked.
(highlight that researchers aren't from KP)
We want to emphasize that when we ask whether your expe-
rience was "different," we are not assuming that either kind
of workplace is better than the other.
(highlight that by "different" we mean good, bad, mixed--
not just "better")
I am not sure if you have ever participated in a focus group
before, but it is something between an interview and a dinner
party conversation. I have a list of questions and topics that
we'll discuss as a group. We'll be talking for about 90 min-
utes and I will be jotting down some notes during our
conversation.
Here are some basic ground rules:
1. WE WANT YOU TO DO THE TALKING.
8 INQUIRY
We would like everyone to participate. I may call on you if I
haven't heard from you in a while.
2. THERE ARE NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS
Every person's experiences and opinions are important.
Speak up whether you agree or disagree with what others are
saying, if your experiences are similar or different from oth-
ers'. We want to hear a wide range of perspectives.
3. PLEASE BE COMPLETELY OPEN
We want everyone to feel comfortable. Please feel free to
speak your mind. Nothing you have to say about your experi-
ence, good, bad or mixed, will affect your status with
SCPMG, with ABIM, or with anyone else. If we ever publish
or present anything about what we learn from these groups,
we'll make sure nobody can identify you.
4. WE WILL BE TAPE RECORDING THE GROUP
This facility is set up to record audio. We will use these
recordings to check our notes afterwards, in case there's any-
thing we've missed. But we will protect your confidential-
ity--as I mentioned if we ever publish or present anything
from these groups we will keep you anonymous.
Do you have any questions before we begin?
1. Introductions--name, specialty, and where did you
work before KP?
 2. How did you come to work at KP?
a. Probes: did they seek out KP, were they recruited,
actively sought to leave previous job, had to find
new work due to a move, etc.
b. Probe: if they actively sought out working at KP,
why?
c. Probe: if they were recruited, what info in the
recruiting process made KP seem appealing?
 3. Was there anything you had to learn to do differently to
practice as a physician--anything that made working as
a physician at this kind of organization different than
where you worked previously? If so, what? [participants
will be asked to write down top 3 differences before dis-
cussing, and go in turn to read their notes to the team]
a. Probes: think about difference in both clinical
practices and in the structure or culture of the
organization.
b. Possible probes: was there anything that made
the "job description" for physicians fundamen-
tally different?
c. Probes: was there anything specific that seemed
challenging/easier? If so, what?
 4. Was there anything different in terms of an emphasis
on abilities or clinical skills/areas of expertise you
may have already had, but that were not a focus of
your previous employment setting?
 5. Was there anything different about working with the
other providers you need to coordinate or collabo-
rate with to care for patients--other physicians,
nurses, etc?
a. Possible probes: did KP require new teamwork-
ing skills/attitudes? Different habits of working
with others? More/less teamwork?
b. Possible probe: anything different about the
interaction between PCPs and specialists?
 6. Was there anything different about dealing with
patients?
a. Possible probes: different relationship with
patients; providing different kinds of care; differ-
ent modes of communication (phone, email, etc),
logistics of scheduling and referrals; patients had
different/similar expectations/knowledge, differ-
ent kinds of questions?
 7. Was there anything different about dealing with hos-
pital or practice administration?
a. Possible probes: more/less direct interaction
with administrators; more/less need to be aware
of organizational priorities; more/less need to
follow organizational rules
8. Was there anything different about how you stay
up-to-date on what you need to know to practice
medicine?
 9. Was there anything different about KP compared to
your old practice in terms of diversity--of other pro-
viders? Staff and other workers? Patients?
a. Possible probe: anything different about how
accommodating patient diversity might have
impacted work as a physician?
10. Was there anything else that struck you as notably
different about working at this type of organization
from where you worked previously, or where you did
your residency? If so, what?
a. Possible probes: anything that stood out to make
KP feel like a notably different type of organiza-
tion . . . "a different animal."
11. How long did it take you to feel like you knew what
was expected of you in terms of both clinical skills
Chesluk et al 9
and cultural norms? Did this seem like the right
amount of time, or was it shorter or longer than what
you expected?
12. Was there anything you wish you'd known about
working in this type of organization before
arriving?
13. If organizations like KP become more common, what
should med school or residency programs do differ-
ently to prepare physicians to work in them?
14. What advice would you give a physician like your-
self considering moving to a job at an organization
like KP?
15. What could organizations that make sure practicing
physicians are up to date on the knowledge and skills
they need do to help physicians practice in an organi-
zation like KP?
16. What else should we learn from your experience?
