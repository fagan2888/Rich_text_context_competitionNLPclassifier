Nonfatal Assaults Among Persons Aged 10­24 Years --
United States, 2001­2015

In 2015, persons aged 10­24 years who were treated for
nonfatal assault injuries in emergency departments (EDs) in
the United States accounted for 32% of the approximately
1.5 million patients of all ages that EDs treated for nonfatal
assault injuries (1). CDC analyzed data from the National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System­All Injury Program
(NEISS-AIP) to examine 2001­2015 trends in nonfatal assault
injuries among youths treated in EDs, by sex and age group,
and to assess current rates by sex, age group, mechanism of
injury, and disposition (1). Rates for 2001­2015 were signifi-
cantly higher among males than among females and among
young adults aged 20­24 years than among youths aged 10­14
and 15­19 years. During 2011­2015, rates declined for all
groups. The 2015 rate among persons aged 10­24 years was
753.2 per 100,000 population, the lowest in the 15-year study
period. Despite encouraging trends, the assault rate among
young persons remains high. Rates in 2015 were higher among
males, persons aged 20­24 years, and those who incurred
intentional strike or hit injuries. Nearly one in 10 patients
were admitted to the hospital, transferred to another hospital,
or held for observation. Youth violence prevention strategies,
including primary prevention approaches that build individual
skills, strengthen family relationships, or connect young per-
sons treated in EDs to immediate and ongoing support, can
be implemented to decrease injuries and fatalities (2).
NEISS-AIP collects data from a nationally representative
sample of EDs, using specific guidelines for recording the
primary diagnosis and mechanism of all types of treated inju-
ries. NEISS-AIP is operated by the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission in collaboration with CDC's National
Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Data are acces-
sible using CDC's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and
Reporting System (1). The analysis was limited to patients
treated for nonfatal assault injuries, which included injury
resulting from an act of violence where physical force by one
or more persons was involved and excluded injuries related to
sexual assault. Data were stratified by calendar year, sex, and
5-year age group (10­14, 15­19, and 20­24 years). Data for
2015 were also stratified by mechanism of injury (struck by/
against, cut/pierce, firearm, or other) and disposition (treated
and released, transferred to another hospital, held for obser-
vation, left against medical advice, or left without being seen

by physician). Annual injury rates (per 100,000 population)
were computed overall and for the indicated strata. Joinpoint
regression* was used to test the significance of trends from
2001 to 2015. Changes in the annual nonfatal assault rate
among persons aged 10­24 years by sex and age group were
examined. Annual percentage change (APC) estimates that
were statistically significant (p<0.05) are presented to indicate
the magnitude and direction of significant trends.
During 2001­2015, approximately 9.6 million persons aged
10­24 years were treated in EDs for nonfatal assault injuries,
an average annual rate of 1,003.9 per 100,000 (Table). Rates
were significantly higher among males (1,265.3 per 100,000)
than among females (729.0). Rates were higher for young
adults aged 20­24 years (1,376.5) than for persons aged
10­14 years (461.7) and 15­19 years (1,159.7). The overall
nonfatal assault rate per 100,000 persons aged 10­24 declined
during the 15-year study period from 1,179.7 in 2001 to 753.2
in 2015, the lowest rate in the study period (Figure 1). During
2011­2015, the overall nonfatal assault injury rate declined
27.5% (Table). During this period, rates for males and females
declined 30.1% and 22.7%, respectively; the average annual
percentage decrease was 8.5% for males and 7.4% for females
(Figure 1). Also during 2011­2015, rates for persons aged
10­14, 15­19, and 20­24 years declined 35.5%, 30.6%, and
23.8%, respectively (Table). The injury rate declined 11.5%

per year for persons aged 10­14 years, 9.2% for persons aged
15­19 years, and 5.6% for persons aged 20­24 years (Figure 2).
In 2015, an estimated 485,610 persons aged 10­24 years
were treated in EDs for nonfatal assault injuries. The rate of
nonfatal assault injuries among persons aged 10­24 years was
914.9 per 100,000 for males and 583.9 for females; by age
group, it was 267.0 per 100,000 for persons aged 10­14 years,
813.1 for persons aged 15­19 years, and 1,138.6 for persons
aged 20­24 years.
Most persons aged 10­24 years treated in an ED for nonfatal
assault injuries (81.2%) were treated for injuries related to
being intentionally struck or hit. Other leading mechanisms
of nonfatal injuries included being cut, stabbed, or pierced
(8.1%), and having firearm-related injuries (5.7%). Most
persons in this age range who visited an ED for assault injuries
were treated and released (87.0%); 9.9% were hospitalized,
transferred to another hospital, or held for observation; and
3.1% left the ED against medical advice or left without being
seen by a physician.
Discussion
For decades, young persons have represented a substantial
proportion of patients receiving treatment in EDs for assault
injuries. The findings in this report demonstrate that the rate
of nonfatal assault injuries among persons aged 10­24 years
has declined since 2001, with significant declines overall and

by sex and age group since 2011. These encouraging declines
are consistent with previous analyses and recent trends in
youth violence (3,4). The declines might indicate increased
implementation and beneficial effects of evidence-based
prevention strategies that reach young persons (2,5). A
number of primary prevention strategies have been shown
to reduce the risk for and occurrence of youth violence,
including school-based programs that build communication
and problem-solving skills and family approaches that help
caregivers set age-appropriate rules, monitor youth activities
and relationships, and address other risk factors (e.g., child-
hood conduct problems and delinquency) (2).
The ED is an important implementation setting for preven-
tion, in part because a large proportion of patients will experi-
ence a subsequent assault-related injury or premature death
within a few years of a treated injury (6,7). For example, one
study compared persons aged 14­24 years who sought treat-
ment in the ED and reported substance use in the 6 months
before the visit. Of the young persons who were seen initially
for an assault-related injury, 36.7% were seen again for an
assault-related injury within 24 months, compared with 22.4%
of the young persons initially seen for other conditions (e.g.,
unintentional injury or illness) (6).
The implementation of brief ED interventions to reduce
the continuation and escalation of violence is growing (8).
These programs vary in design and duration but typically
identify youths in the ED when they are examined for a
violence-related injury. The programs are implemented
by trained staff members (e.g., medical personnel, com-
munity service providers, and program outreach workers)
who provide immediate and follow-up services to increase
risk awareness, conflict resolution skills, and connection to
community support (e.g., academic or vocational supports
and mental health treatment). Research has shown that these
programs have significant benefits, including sustained reduc-
tions in perpetration and victimization of peer violence (9).
Evaluation of a specific program found that participants were
70% less likely than nonparticipating youths to be arrested
for any offense during the 6 months after the program (10).
The findings of this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, injury rates are likely underestimates of the actual
prevalence because data are limited to persons treated in EDs
and do not include those who had injuries treated in other
health care facilities (e.g., physician's office or urgent care
center) or those for whom no treatment was needed or sought.
Second, data were coded by trained personnel based on narra-
tives abstracted from patients' medical records, for which details

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Persons aged 10­24 years account for a substantial proportion
of nonfatal assault injuries treated in emergency departments
(EDs) in the United States.
What is added by this report?
The 2015 rate for nonfatal injuries among persons aged
10­24 years was 753.2 per 100,000 population, the lowest rate
in the 15-year study period (2001­2015). From 2011 to 2015,
injury rates declined among both males and females and all age
groups examined. Despite these findings, assault injuries
continue to occur often, with 485,610 young persons treated in
EDs for assault-related injuries in 2015.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Primary prevention strategies that build communication and
problem-solving skills and address risk factors for violence
among young persons can stop violence before it starts.
Expansion of these strategies and additional interventions
focused on injured young persons while they are receiving ED
treatment to connect to immediate and ongoing community
support might decrease the risk for reinjury or fatality. CDC's
technical package to prevent youth violence helps communities
and states prioritize strategies with the best available evidence.
of the injuries and circumstances varied. Inaccuracies in the
abstraction and coding process might have occurred. Third,
differences by race and ethnicity could not be examined because
of the high prevalence of missing race/ethnicity data (20.3%).
Finally, data are based on information in the ED record and are
not linked to other data sources (e.g., police reports or school
disciplinary reports) that might provide additional information
about the circumstances related to the injury or the relationship
between the perpetrator and victim.
Although the number of young persons treated for nonfatal
assault injuries in EDs is declining, and this trend is promising,
these injuries remain common and costly. In 2015, approxi-
mately 485,610 young persons were treated for assault-related
injuries, and associated medical and lost productivity costs
were approximately $3.4 billion (1).These injuries continue to
occur most often among males and among young adults aged
20­24 years, highlighting the groups that need to be reached
with continued and enhanced prevention strategies. Violence
among young persons is preventable with the implementation
of evidence-based policies and programs that significantly
reduce the risk for injuries and associated risk factors. CDC's
A Comprehensive Technical Package for the Prevention of Youth
Violence and Associated Risk Behaviors (https://www.cdc.gov/
violenceprevention/pdf/yv-technicalpackage.pdf) can help
states and communities focus their collaborative action on
strategies supported by the best available evidence (2).
