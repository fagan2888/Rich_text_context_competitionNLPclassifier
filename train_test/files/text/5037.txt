Introduction
University education in Nigeria began during the colonial
era with the establishment of the University College, Ibadan,
in 1948 (Akpotu & Akpochafo, 2009; Okebukola, 2010).
Nigeria obtained its independence in 1960, and within two
years, there were five universities (Okebukola, 2006).
Subsequently as Erinosho (2007) and Geo-JaJa and Mangum
(2003) argue, the number of universities began to increase in
geometric progression as there was a need to produce quality
manpower and to give the qualified candidates access to
higher education (HE) (Saint, Hartnett, & Strassner, 2003).
Asof2010,Nigeriahadatotalof104universities(Okebukola,
2010) and within two years, the numbers increased from 104
to 125 (National Universities Commission [NUC], 2012).
Thus, to situate this discourse properly, an attempt will here-
under be made to examine how and why the establishment of
universities and granting access to attain HE became a prior-
ity, not just in Nigeria but in otherAfrican states in the 1960s,
which then led to the establishment of many government-
owned and private universities (PUs) in the continent.
The 1961 Addis Ababa Conference and
Development of University Education
Historically, the Second World War that lasted between 1939
and 1945 in many ways retarded the world's social,
economic, educational, and human developments. After the
war in 1945, the United Nations was formed, and one of its
immediate concerns was the declaration of fundamental
human rights. To this end, the UN General Assembly on
December 10, 1948, adopted the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) and one of its main priorities (as part
of the declaration) was the promotion of rights to education,
which according to Lockheed and Verspoor (1991) "shall be
free at least in the elementary and fundamental stages"
(p. 22).
In line with this, a conference jointly sponsored by the
United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) and Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA) that was aimed at promoting the right to edu-
cation in African subregion and setting targets on how to
achieve it was held in 1961 at Addis Ababa (Lee, 1988;
Obasi, 2000). After this conference, UNESCO and its affili-
ate organizations organized many other conferences and

The McDonaldization of Nigerian
Universities: A Sociological Analysis and
Critique of Engendering Policies
Emeka W. Dumbili1,2
Abstract
This article examines the extent to which the deregulation of Nigerian higher education (HE) has facilitated the McDonaldization
of the universities. University education in Nigeria commenced in 1948 with the establishment of the University College,
Ibadan. After independence in 1960, subsequent governments expanded the number of universities, a policy based on a lack
of quality manpower in leadership positions created by the exit of British officials and the need to grant access to an increasing
number of prospective students. In the 1970s, the number of universities increased accompanied by a decline in infrastructure,
funding, and working conditions. This resulted in several strikes and an exodus of academics to other countries. Instead of
tackling the problems, the federal government shifted responsibilities by approving private ownership of universities in 1999
and by establishing the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) in 2001. Against this backdrop, this article critically
analyzes how some of these reforms facilitated the McDonaldization of Nigerian universities. The article reveals how this has
resulted in an overloading of responsibilities on the faculty, erosion of academic autonomy, a prioritization of quantity over
quality of publications, and an assumption of "customer" status by students. The article uses evidence from McDonaldized HE
in Western countries to discuss the implications of these developments and suggests some remedial measures.

meetings (Sherman, 1990) with the aim of improving access
to not just primary education in Africa but secondary and
HE. Such meetings were held in Paris (1962), in Abidjan
(March 1964), in Lagos between July and August 1964
(Resnik, 2006; Yates, 1964), and so on.
In the Addis Ababa's conference that was attended by
39 African ministers of education and five delegates (rep-
resenting five European countries; Yoloye, 1986) for
instance, it was agreed to "set a goal for the achievement
of 100% universal compulsory 6-year primary education in
Africa in 1980" (Obasi, 2000, p. 189). Although this was
central to the meeting, priority was also placed on the
development of secondary and HE (Bray, 1986), and this
can be authenticated by the fact that the African delegates
averred that
some African countries have unduly neglected secondary and
HE in proportion to primary education. Economic development
is highly dependent on skills of the sort which are taught in
institutions to students of 15 years of age and upwards. It is of
the highest priority to ensure that an adequate proportion of the
population receives secondary, post-secondary and university
education; this should be put before the goal of universal primary
education . . . (UNESCO, 1961, cited in Bray, 1986, p. 149)
In fact, it can be argued that one main reason for laying
emphasis on the development of HE is to meet the human
resource demands in most African countries orchestrated by
not just the exit of foreign workforce following the attain-
ment of independence in many African states, but need to
accelerate social and economic development in the African
continent that suffered many years of colonial intrusion, con-
trol, and deprivation. Thus, Sherman (1990) notes that "these
circumstances set the tone, and markedly influenced the
course of higher educational development on the continent"
(p. 368).
In consonance with this immediate need to develop man-
power, many African countries initiated the implementation
of free and mandatory Universal Primary Education (UPE)
after the 1961's conference, but it was not launched in
Nigeria until September 1976 (Obasi, 1997). The funding in
Nigeria was made possible following the boom in the econ-
omy that was orchestrated by the rise in price of crude oil in
the global market (Obasi, 2000). The boom did not just affect
primary education; it led to the establishment of many fed-
eral and state-owned universities in Nigeria.
This economic growth seemingly continued until the
early 1980s that saw the beginning of decline following eco-
nomic recession that affected many developing countries.
According to Obasi (2000), the "recession was triggered off
by the sudden collapse of the world market price for crude
oil" (p. 192) that Nigeria mainly depended on, but another
reason was due to the fact that the oil revenue derived during
the oil windfall was mismanaged and embezzled due to
hyper-corruption in the Nigerian polity. The result of this and
how it affected education is hereunder examined.
Structural Adjustment Program (SAP)
and Education in Nigeria
In the late 1970s down to early 1980s, many developing
countries witnessed severe economic hardship and this
forced many of them to opt for the World Bank and/or
International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) policy of Structural
adjustment (Konadu-Agyemang, 2000). SAP is one of the
World Bank and IMF's microeconomics policies mapped out
for developing countries under debt to adopt and implement
via loan facilities to remedy their ailing economy (Obasi,
2000; Vavrus, 2005). Some of the policy's characteristics
include privatization and commercialization of government-
owned assets and companies, drastic reduction in govern-
ment expenditures and devaluation of the country's currency
(Riddell, 1992; Vavrus, 2005).
In Nigeria, for instance, the distress in the economy in the
1980s forced the then democratic government headed by
President Shagari to begin to negotiate for the World Bank/
IMF loan (irrespective of the fact that stringent conditions
were attached to the loan), but this was discontinued when
the government was overthrown in 1983 by General Buhari-
led military government (Obasi, 2000). Again, in 1985,
Buhari's government was overthrown by General Ibrahim
Babangida, who in 1986 adopted SAP with severe implica-
tion on the education (Hinchliffe, 1989). Just as Ilon (1994)
notes that one main attribute of SAP globally is "a decrease
in funds available for education as a component of social
sector" (p. 97), the implementation of SAP meant a total
withdrawal of scarcely given fund to the Nigerian
universities.
This is why Geo-Jaja and Mangum (2001) note that SAP
contributed to the problems of the African and more pre-
cisely, the Nigerian society. To these scholars, this was
because the "adjusters took the easy way out. Instead of
insisting that corruption be ferreted out, or that military
expenditures be cut, they slashed more visible expenditures
on education or public health . . . " (p. 31). The introduction
of SAP worsened the extant poor funding of education and
general condition, and this created tension in the economy
that resulted in several protests by different associations such
as the National Association of Nigerian Students, the
Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), and so on
(Shettima, 1993), but the government remained adamant.
This neglect in funding necessitated the introduction of fee
paying programs in the universities as well as orchestrated
several industrial actions in the Nigerian HE. Again, one of
the ways the government of Nigeria tried to cushion the
effect of recession was the encouragement of private partici-
pation in the ownership of universities in Nigeria (Okebukola,
2006).
The Origin of PUs in Nigeria
As noted, the need for increased access necessitated the
establishment of many universities in Nigeria after
Dumbili 3
independence. Presently, three categories of university exist:
federal government universities (FGUs), state government
universities (SGUs), and PUs. The first to set up universities
was the federal government, but the constitutional amend-
ment that placed HE "under the concurrent list in 1979"
opened the doors for the state governments to own universi-
ties (Okebukola, 2006, p. 27). Again, private ownership of
universities in Nigeria was initiated in the 1980s (during the
economic recession), but due to irregularities, 24 operating
PUs were closed down in 1984 (Okebukola, 2006). As noted,
this was driven by a number of very practical issues such as
the government's inability to fund public universities in the
light of economic recession (that led to SAP) and the govern-
ment's willingness to allow private enterprises in university
education (and many other areas of the economy such as the
banking sector; see Dumbili, 2013a) to meet the ever-
growing demand for it, which was also a response to political
expediency. As said, factors such as bad governance, corrup-
tion, and repression in Nigerian polity (and in many other
African countries, especially military intervention in poli-
tics) made the universities remain sole institutions resisting
such malpractices, and hence denied government funding as
well as ever-growing willingness to privatize them by subse-
quent administrations.
In 1999, Nigeria democratically elected President
Obasanjo, and one of the first policies his administration pur-
sued was the reintroduction of PUs. Thus, three PUs com-
menced operation in that year (Akpotu & Akpochafo, 2009).
The PUs in Nigeria are owned either by religious organiza-
tions or by entrepreneurs. In addition, the federal govern-
ment established the National Open University of Nigeria
(NOUN) in 2001 (Okebukola, 2006) to run online distance
learning degrees (ODL). PUs differ from public universities
(FGUs and SGUs) in (a) the motive for the establishment, (b)
ownership and administrative structure, (c) the admission
process, (d) school fees, and so on. For example, while all
FGUs and SGUs are established mainly to give access to the
increasing Nigerian population seeking entrance to the uni-
versities as earlier noted, some PUs (especially those owned
by religious bodies) are likely to give access to specific reli-
gious adherents while many (especially those owned by
entrepreneurs) are established with profit motives (Erinosho,
2007). In terms of the administrative structures of the univer-
sities, there have always been government interferences
(Teferra & Altbachl, 2004). In the FGUs, the President who
is the Visitor1 has the final say in the appointment of a Vice
Chancellor. In the SGUs, the State Governor has the highest
authority, while the entrepreneurs manage their PUs.
Irrespective of the structure, it is worthy of note that the main
reasons for initiating the privatization of Nigerian HE was
due to the utterly dreadful character of Nigerian public HE
(orchestrated by long neglect by the government) and the
need to grant additional access to the increasing admission
seekers.
Although university education as earlier noted com-
menced before Nigeria became politically independent, it
has in several ways received less attention than it deserved
from the government. This negligence and underfunding by
successive governments of Nigeria, especially in the light of
era of SAP necessitated in 1990 that the then federal govern-
ment initiated "the Longe Commission on the Review of
Higher Education in Nigeria" to develop strategies to tackle
the above problems (Okuwa, 2004, p. 2). The Commission
made recommendations, but they were not implemented by
the military government. The subsequent action is what
Odebiyi and Aina (1999) summed as follows:
The Association of University Union (ASUU) embarked on a
seven-month general strike in 1992 which paralyzed activities in
the universities. Some of theASUU's agitations include funding,
academic freedom, and university autonomy. ASUU's strike
actions attracted government intimidation and harassment with
many of its national executives incarcerated. (pp. 67-68)
This was followed by another strike in 1993 because the
government failed to implement the agreement with ASUU
when the 1992 strike was suspended (Okuwa, 2004). In a bid
to restore the lost glory in the Nigerian HE, the federal gov-
ernment introduced "the National Policy on Education of
1998" and Section 49 stated that
the internal organization and administration of each institution
shall be its own responsibility; the traditional areas of academic
freedom for the institutions are: selecting their students except
where the law prescribes otherwise; appoint their staff, teach,
select areas of research; and determine the content of the courses.
(Arikewuyo, 2004, p. 129)
Although this brought a glimpse of hope, academic free-
dom was still far from being assured because of the clause
contained in the same policy document: "Government shall
continue to respect this freedom as long as these areas are in
consonance with the national goal" (Arikewuyo, 2004, p.
129). Since the democratic government took over in 1999,
many other reforms and policies have ensued in the Nigerian
HE. Some of these reforms and policies include the Virtual
(Digital) Library Project of 2004 (Okebukola, 2006, 2010,
2011) and the Quality Assurance (QA) Policy of the NUC
that started following the creation of its department in 2005
(Okojie, 2008).
It is against this backdrop that this article uses Ritzer's
McDonaldization thesis to analyze the myriad of evidence
that shows the extent to which the recent reforms have
opened the doors for the McDonaldizing process in the
Nigerian universities leading to erosion of the fragile aca-
demic autonomy. It is worthy of note that to my knowledge,
this is the first attempt to examine the McDonaldization of
Nigerian HE. The focus of this article is, therefore, to explore
when, how, and why the McDonaldization of HE began in
Nigeria; the implications of this McDonaldizing process; and
possible remedies to the adverse consequences of
McDonaldization of HE. Drawing on available secondary
data and personal observation, the article makes explicit
4 SAGE Open
sociological contributions to the ongoing debate on
McDonaldization of HE. It is aimed at not just the Nigerian
policy makers but to draw the attention of policy makers in
other developing countries to urge caution when formulating
HE policies, especially without proper feasibility studies and
wide consultations with stakeholders. The article is divided
into four sections: the following section lays out the theoreti-
cal framework guiding the article; the next explores
McDonaldizing processes and the implications in the
Nigerian universities while the last section contains conclud-
ing remarks regarding possible remedial measures.
Theoretical Framework
The McDonaldization Thesis
McDonaldization is a sociological concept Ritzer (2000)
used to explore the increasing rationalization of postmodern
society (Smart, 1999). Ritzer drew on Weber's bureaucrati-
zation/rationalization theory to examine the rationalization
of McDonald's food industry (Ritzer, 2000). To Max Weber,
the upsurge of "two great forces of modernity--which he
claimed are capitalism and bureaucracy" in Western society,
created social change that affected every facet of social life
(Lippmann & Aldrich, 2003, pp. 134-135). Although he
believed that human society has experienced rationality (in
different forms and in different stages), none of them has
experienced what he called "formal rationality," which he
defined as "the search by people for the optimum means to a
given end" which is "shaped by rules, regulations, and large
social structures" (Ritzer, 2000, p. 23).
This structure is what he called bureaucratic organization,
and according to Smart (1999), this was the "most prominent
expression of the institutionalization of formal rationality: a
form of organization, of rules and regulations, which was
considered to constitute an optimum means for realizing pre-
ordained ends" (p. 3). As noted, his argument was that the
rationalization process that he believed has inevitably
infested modern Western world will forever transform not
just the Western world but all human society even though he
believed the latter will be in the future (Lippmann & Aldrich,
2003). Weber noted that bureaucratization of human organi-
zation, which makes it superior to, as well as dominates other
types of organizations (Lippmann & Aldrich, 2003), is nec-
essary. Although important due to its efficiency, he added
that this will in turn create "uncheckable dynamics of ratio-
nalization . . . which locks the actors it involves into the iron
cage, leaving them no way out" (Bender, Poggi, & Smart,
1999, p. 26), and thus, culminates in disenchantment of these
social actors ( Lee, 2010).
Drawing largely on this theory, Ritzer (2000) succinctly
states that McDonaldization is "the process by which the
principles of fast-food restaurant are coming to dominate
more and more sectors of American society as well as of the
rest of the world" (p. 1). Although of American origin, Ritzer
(2001) avers that this McDonaldization process is gradually
spreading to other parts of the globe and is dominating every
sphere of the social milieu. These principles are fourfold:
"efficiency, calculability, predictability and control" (Ritzer,
2000, pp. 12-14). He further pointed out that this process
often engenders unintended consequences, which can be lik-
ened, to "the fifth dimension of McDonaldization," or irra-
tionality of rationality because "rational systems are often
unreasonable" (p. 16).
Efficiency is "the optimum method for getting from one
point to another" (Ritzer, 2000, p. 12). McDonald's provides
customers with the best and the quickest ways of moving
"from being hungry to being full," and the workforce is
equally trained to follow the "predesigned process" effi-
ciently (p. 12). To achieve this, customers are indirectly
recruited to the workforce by making them serve themselves,
eat, and clean up the rubbish afterward (Ritzer, 2001). In HE,
Ritzer (2000) points out that the quest for efficiency has led
to the machine-graded examination that makes it possible for
even a "graduate assistant" to grade students (p. 49). The aim
of efficiency according to Hartley (1995) "is the optimisation
of resources, but this, in turn, implies that the product itself
is definable, precisely without ambiguity" (p. 411).
In terms of calculability or quantification, McDonald's
prefers quantity to quality. For example, Ritzer (2001) posits
that McDonald's lays "emphasis on the quantitative aspects
of products sold (portion, size, cost) and service offered (the
time it takes to get the product)" (p. 199). What matters most
in a typical McDonald's restaurant is the number and size of
food produced in the shortest time while the quality is incon-
sequential, and this is because profit is determined by the
number of items sold (Ritzer, 2000). In HE, Ritzer points to
evidence of this quantification such as the rating or ranking
of universities which helps students to choose from a menu,
the grading of students, the emphasis on credentials, the
number of hours people work weekly, and the number of
publications (as against its quality). Furthermore, he posited
that "the focus seems to be on how many students (`the prod-
uct') that can be herded through the system and what grades
they earn rather than the quality of what they have learned"
(Ritzer, 2000, p. 66). Similarly, Hartley (1995) argues that
"quantification allows for comparability and, therefore, for
competition, which rewards the winners and shows up the
losers" (p. 411).
Predictability is the third dimension of McDonaldization,
and this is "the assurance that products and services will be
the same over time and in all locales" (Ritzer, 2000, p. 13).
Because of homogenization of the processes of food produc-
tion, the size, taste, color, and so on are predictable in all
McDonald's restaurants (Ritzer, 2000). Ritzer (2000) there-
fore notes that this has infested HE, and it is evident in the
similarity of courses, textbooks, uniformity of syllabuses,
multiple questions, grading system, and so on. Finally, there
is an emphasis on control. Here, Ritzer (2001) argues that
because humans are highly unpredictable, control becomes
Dumbili 5
inevitable, which necessitates the "substitution of nonhuman
for human technology" (p. 200). This is why machines are
involved in food production while only a few humans are
employed (Ritzer, 2001). In HE, Ritzer (2001) also argues
that "universities have developed a variety of nonhuman
technologies to exert control over professors" (p. 108).
Academics are meant to work under pressure to teach, exam-
ine, and submit students' grade at a specified time.
Furthermore, he argues that students are also controlled in
various ways. For example, they are given "little leeway in
the courses they may take" and "because of the tyranny of
the clock, a class must end at the sound of the bell, even if the
students are just about to comprehend something important,"
especially in high schools (Ritzer, 2001, pp. 114-115).
McDonaldization and Nigerian
Universities: Evidence and Implications
Privatization of HE
Suffice it to say that the privatization of Nigerian HE in
1999, the reintroduction of NOUN in 2001, and the creation
of the QA department in NUC in 2005 marked the point of
departure for the massification, commercialization, and the
McDonaldizing process in Nigerian universities. Although
George Ritzer's analysis of the McDonaldization of HE was
originally based on the American universities, it has become
difficult to ignore the fact that McDonaldization principles
driven by capitalism and technology are spreading across the
entire globe though the impact may not be exactly the same.
To appropriately situate this discourse in this section, it is
noteworthy to mention that privatization and marketization
of HE is not a Nigerian reserve. In fact, it can be argued to
have been an international trend since World War II. Thus, it
became exigencies in many African countries (after indepen-
dence) such as Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, Uganda, and so on
due to increasing demand for HE, the inability of public
schools to admit ever-growing number of qualified candi-
dates, and most importantly, lack of proper funding, most
especially at the wake of economic recession that necessi-
tated the adoption of adjustment policies in these countries
(see Eisemon & Salmi, 1993; Munene, 2008; Munene &
Otieno, 2008; Samoff, 1990).
For example, in 1980 before SAP was adopted in Nigeria
according to Hoffman (1995), the total enrollment of stu-
dents in the Nigerian universities was 70,000 while 6.4% of
public fund was budgeted for education. In 1990 (post-SAP
era), the number increased to 160,767, while the sector
received only 1% of government expenditure, and govern-
ment spending continued to decrease in subsequent years
(Dabalen, Oni, & Adekola, 2001). Similarly, Aluede, Idogho,
and Imonikhe's (2012) statistics show that of 537,226 candi-
dates who applied to the 39 existing universities in 1998-
1999 session, only 64,176 (11.9%) were admitted leaving the
rest 473,050 to their fate. Again, in 2002-2003 session, 53
existing universities in Nigeria received 994,381 applica-
tions but were only able to admit 51,843 (5.2%) students,
while 123,626 (15.3%) students of 806,089 who applied in
2006-2007 session got admitted (Aluede et al., 2012).
Against this backdrop, privatization of HE (to increase
access) in Nigeria may seemingly be justified, but as the
analysis below will reveal, it can be argued to be not just a
shift in government responsibilities but a policy designed
without proper feasibility study, wide consultation with
stakeholders, or any cushion effect.
References will now be made to United Kingdom, the
United States, and other countries that have McDonaldized
HE. The aim is not for comparison, but to draw lessons from
them so as to show Nigerian policy makers in particular and
othercountriesingeneraltheconsequencesofMcDonaldizing
HE in a fragile economy such as Nigeria. Again, the article is
not to argue that the privatization of Nigerian HE and other
related policies the government pursued are bad because
some of them have begun to yield positive results (Moruku,
2013). My focus is to highlight and critique the negative
impact of these policies that policy makers may have not
taken into consideration before the implementation of the
policies so as to avoid such mistakes in future policies for-
mulation and implementation. This is because Ritzer (2000)
argues that the four principles of McDonaldization (effi-
ciency, calculability, predictability, and control) often engen-
der unintended consequences (irrationalities).
As noted, the Nigerian government in 1999 approved pri-
vate ownership of universities (Akpotu & Akpochafo, 2009)
and introduced the NOUN in 2001 (Okebukola, 2006). This
was instead of improving the poor state of government uni-
versities, and this led to the establishment of three PUs in
that year. To further strengthen privatization, the government
approved more PUs, and as of November 2013, the numbers
of PUs in Nigeria have reached 51 while FGUs total 40
(NUC, 2013). The Nigerian privatization system is charac-
terized by capitalism and its principles of too much emphasis
on profit at the shortest time, while quality is arguably imma-
terial. Thus, this emphasis of capitalism on profit has the ten-
dency to homogenize and degrade everything in its path, and
this happened when the Nigeria government introduced sim-
ilar reforms in the banking sector in 2005 (see Dumbili,
2013c). Following the introduction of private ownership of
universities, emphasis has begun to be laid on the "market-
driven degrees and diplomas" (Erinosho, 2007, p. 50) and
the number of students who are produced yearly. Another
recent phenomenon is the increasing emphasis on missions
and visions of each school, arguably aimed to make its prod-
uct attractive to potential customers. Each school's website
displays how effectively they graduate students, how condu-
cive or stable their programs are, and how competitive their
cost is compared with others (public universities). The
NOUN is not left out in this competition because it vividly
advertises its courseware, fees, and other academic
activities.
6 SAGE Open
Although the massification of education (through PUs) in
quest for efficiency may increase access as noted, studies
have shown that it may not be the only or best means of
achieving this. For instance, it makes room for market-driven
certification where results are measured according to "per-
formance indicators and efficiency" rather than "educated
graduates" (Mok, 1999, p. 118). In addition, it is likely to
"perpetuate inequality than eradicate it" (Gouthro, 2002, p.
30) because of its high cost (Adeogun, Subair, & Osifila,
2009; Alani, 2006; Geo-Jaja, 2004; Omoleke, 2011). For
example, one of the PUs in Nigeria (Igbinedion University)
placed its fee for 2012-2013 session at 643,350 naira
(US$4,106; Igbinedion University Okada, 2012), whereas
government universities (GUs) charged about 50,000 naira
(US$309). This makes it more difficult for the poor to pay
and opens up wider doors for the elites. This is because a
majority of Nigerians live below US$1 per day, and the mini-
mum wage for workers is 18,000 naira (US$115). This leads
to irrationality because the quest for efficiency (more access
through PUs) is leading to inefficiency as it excludes a large
number because of the high cost (Ritzer, 2000).
Another consequence of this McDonaldizing process is
that it has arguably begun to engender unhealthy competi-
tions between GUs and PUs. Because the latter are arguably
profit-oriented (Adeogun et al., 2009; Erinosho, 2007), there
tend to be a larger number of students in a class than facilities
can accommodate (Erinosho, 2007). This massification of
students arguably is becoming one of the criteria for judging
the faculty in GUs by policy makers (Bryson, 2004). This
lends support to Margolis's (2004) argument that "faculty are
pressurised to recruit and retain students . . . and to compete
with private for-profit universities" (pp. 368-369). In addi-
tion, the policy of privatization of HE in Nigeria will further
perpetuate the perennial low government funding of univer-
sity education in Nigeria (Odebiyi & Aina, 1999; Saint et al.,
2003).
Another implication of this deregulation of HE in Nigeria
is that it has opened doors for increasing illicit universities in
Nigeria. Because PUs are run "on franchise basis" (Healey,
2008, p. 334), entrepreneurs come in to make profits. In
2009, NUC discovered that 41 illegal universities were oper-
ating in Nigeria (Adeogun et al., 2009). Further revelations
show that 48 illegal universities exist in Nigeria in 2012, and
"this list of illegal universities is not exhaustive" (NUC
Bulletin, 2012, p. 16). This is likely to lead many students
who are seeking university education to fall into the hands of
swindlers. Just as Ritzer (2000) argues that a McDonaldized
system is not always reasonable, the quest for more access
and efficiency by privatizing HE in Nigeria rather than
expanding, equipping, and funding existing ones has resulted
in irrationalities.
Efficiency in the Nigerian Universities
The success of McDonald's is hinged on efficiency, and this
is the rationale for scripting jobs and interaction to eliminate
time wasting (Ritzer, 2000). This has infested HE in many
Western countries (Halfond & Boyd, 1997; Hartley, 1995;
Hayes, 2006). For example, Western universities in a quest
for efficiency now run many online degrees, use courseware
to teach, employ few lecturers whose tenures are not fixed,
eliminate academic autonomy, and regard students as cus-
tomers (Franz, 1998; Margolis, 2004; McIlvenny, Lassen, &
Raudaskoski, 2002; Parker & Jary, 1995). This is why Bender
et al. (1999) argue that McDonaldization tends to provide "a
set of menacing and probably inescapable tendencies toward
dehumanization" (p. 23). In Nigerian Universities, some of
these features are beginning to surface. Following the rein-
troduction of NOUN in 2001, online studies are now possi-
ble (Okebukola, 2010), and many other universities have
adopted this computer-based learning. The NOUN presently
provides courseware and other e-learning facilities for stu-
dents to study and acquire online degrees and diplomas. On
its part, the NUC created the Department of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) in September 2010 with
the following vision and mission:
to facilitate the utilization of ICT for teaching, research, planning
management and effective evaluation through the decision
making package in the Nigeria university system; the department
is to assist the NUC to carry out its mandate in the deregulated
Nigeria university system . . . (NUC, 2014)
Although ICT innovation is germane to HE globally, it
does not go without cost. It has been reported that, in many
Nigerian universities, the ICT does not work efficiently due
to improper maintenance (due to poor funding), erratic power
supply (Ehikhamenor, 2003a, 2003b), and the high cost of
using such technologies. In relation to learning, scholars
have argued that e-learning homogenizes learning, kills
diversity and creativity, and culminates in dehumanizing the
learner (Quinn, 2000). One of the reasons for this is that
"persuasive usage on internet technology does not guarantee
positive gains in instructional objectives" (Etherington,
2008, p. 47). In addition, distance learning kills the opportu-
nity of classroom criticism, widens the gap between the
learner and the teacher, erases the civility of the classroom
nurturing, and hinders "classroom interaction skills"
(Grineski, 1999, p. 47). Thus, the students only "learn to do
other than learning to know" (Grineski, 2000, p. 22) because
"hands, not head," do the learning (Hartley, 1995, p. 412).
On the part of the faculty, the pressure to teach and gradu-
ate students to satisfy market demand turns the former to
what Halfond and Boyd (1997) call "teaching machines" (p.
208) who are overloaded with responsibilities that are
expected to be performed efficiently and in the shortest time.
For example, in 2008, a total of 1,096,312 students were
reported to be studying in Nigerian universities, while a total
of 1,644,110 candidates applied for the 2013 JointAdmission
and Matriculation Board (JAMB; Vanguard, 2014). The
increase in the number of students in geometric progression
and lack of commensurate facilities, good working
Dumbili 7
conditions and few numbers of academic staff in Nigeria
contribute to the dehumanization of available staff.
The academics are dehumanized because they are meant
to teach these teaming numbers of students in the same space
(with minimal facility) and are expected to produce quality
graduates. Similarly, in universities where teaching technol-
ogies are used, they are meant to teach with courseware that
they never designed, and grade students with machines that
require little of their skills or input. In the same vein, the
increasing emphasis on internal and external-driven efficien-
cies in all the Nigerian universities means that academics are
meant to work longer hours than they used to do in the past,
teach and graduate students at record time with remarkably
few or no dropout (Ajadi, 2010). One of the implications is
that little or no time will be dedicated to research, which is
supposed to be the hub of universities--yet another
irrationality.
Students as Customers in Quest for
Efficiency in the Nigerian Universities
The viewing of students as customers became widely known
with the seminal work of Franz (1998), though its origin is in
the United States, and began because students paid the great-
est part of the cost of their education in the United States
(Redding, 2005). This is not same in the United Kingdom
where education is mainly funded via money derived from
taxation (Redding, 2005). If this is so, in the Nigerian context
students can be seen as customers. This is because the paying
of fees has been a tradition in Nigerian universities, in that
Education, in general, and HE in particular have always been
underfunded (Erinosho, 2007; Nwaka, 2000; Odebiyi &
Aina, 1999; Okebukola, 2006; Onwunli & Agho, 2004).
Irrespective of the fact that students hitherto paid school
fees prior to the introduction of the current PUs in 1999
(Okojie, 2008), it can be argued that students in these PUs
can be rightly called customers. This is, in part, because of
the way students are beginning to be reified in these PUs.
Although a dearth of published data exist in this debate, it is
generating heated discussions among Nigerians that many
students in most PUs do not attend classes regularly, and lec-
turers do not have the right to disallow such a group from
writing examinations as it is done in most GUs where 75%
attendance is compulsory. This is, arguably, because their
high school fees in the PUs have bought them the privilege.
One of the implications of students being seen and treated
as customers is that, in the quest for efficiency, there is pres-
sure for the manipulation of academic grades. This lends cre-
dence to Franz's (1998) assertion that when students are
customers, "the ultimate outcome is unrelenting grade infla-
tion--keep the student-cum-customer happy and give him or
her what they want" (pp. 63-64). In the Nigerian context,
because students are becoming the customers in the PUs (due
to high school fees and resultant reification), the proprietors
of these schools, arguably, ensure that students get the best
value for their money because their satisfaction will guaran-
tee continued patronage from them and other customers as
the customer is always right. Softening the grading system,
making it easier for students to pass to attract more custom-
ers to their schools, is arguably one of the ways this is done.
This can be authenticated by the proportion of first class
honors that graduate from these PUs yearly (unlike what
FGUs and SGUs with better facilities produce), a factor that
is beginning to generate debates among employers. This is
because these graduates are said to be underperforming, and
this as Erinosho (2007) argues may not be unrelated to the
motive behind the founding of the schools, the qualities of
teachers, and extant poor facilities.
As an example of the above, in a study that investigated
three of the foremost PUs (Babcock, Bowen, and Igbinedion)
in Nigeria, it was reported that "there are 1 doctorate degree
holder to 46 students in Babcock, 1 to 49 in Bowen and 1 to
134 in Igbinedion" (Erinosho, 2007, p. 55), and this lends
credence to the fact that they employed "more masters than
doctorate degree teachers" against NUC rules (p. 64).
Furthermore, this scholar revealed that "the academic pro-
grammes of private universities are circumscribed. The
founders are inclined to mount courses that will attract stu-
dents or money or both, and they may also be inclined to
sacrifice quality" (p. 64). He further added that "the motive
to establish a university might not necessarily be altruistic
but driven by the desire to make money from the gullible and
unsuspecting public" (p. 66). This is, in fact, one of the prob-
lems of massification of HE (Parker & Jary, 1995). However,
the claim that students are customers means that "the pro-
vider's (teacher's) task is to spoon-feed bits of content and
the customer's (student's) task is to assimilate, digest and
regurgitate" on the examination day (De Vita & Case, 2003,
pp. 391-392). It shifts the responsibilities of learning and
places it on the teachers (Van Valey, 2001). Although this
does no good to both the "consumers and sellers of learning"
(De Vita & Case, 2003, p. 391), the fact remains that the
former is losing more because of inactive participation in
learning.
Students as Working Customers in
Quest for Efficiency
In the quest for efficiency in a typical McDonald's, Ritzer
(2000, 2001) notes that customers are co-opted into the labor
process by making them serve themselves in so many ways
without being paid. For example, those who will dare to eat
in the restaurant are meant to queue up, collect food, eat, and
efficiently clear up the rubbish. For others, the run-through
makes it faster, and their "cars are the spaces" that make it
easier for the rubbish to be cleared (Ritzer, 2000). Therefore,
if students are becoming known as customers in Nigeria,
they arguably will be working customers.
The introduction of a techno-based system of registration,
the Virtual (Digital) Library Project (Okebukola, 2006), and
8 SAGE Open
the creation of the ICT department in NUC marked the point
of departure for using students as "manufacturing custom-
ers" (Zwick & Denegri Knott, 2009, p. 221) in Nigerian HE.
As it is in McDonald's, Nigerian students start creating their
own experience before they are admitted into the universi-
ties. Following the introduction of online registration by the
JAMB2 in the late 2000s, students now do most of the jobs
previously done by the JAMB's officials and universities'
nonacademic staff. For example, students buy scratch cards
from JAMB designated centers, go to a cybercafé to buy air-
time, register online, and pay to print the documents before
submitting the forms. If they make a mistake, this attracts
extra cost. If they "pass the test," they return to the cybercafé
to check their results or buy airtime to check through their
phones. If they are successful, they move to the Post-
University Matriculation Examination3 (PUME) and repeat
similar processes.
Here, they buy another scratch card or form from the uni-
versities they chose, go to a cybercafé to register, print the
form, and submit it. If they succeed in the PUME, they need
to go back to the café to make and clear their payment before
they do the online registration of modules (courses or sub-
jects as they are called in the Nigerian HE). When they even-
tually start taking the university's examinations, they will
keep spending money to check their results and perform the
other techno-based school activities because many Nigerian
universities mostly do not have functional Internet facilities,
while those that have do not offer students free access. This
is why private cybercafés flood every Nigerian university
campus.
In the universities that have digital libraries, students
carry out online data searching and processing, photocopy-
ing, scanning, printing, and so on for themselves. Although
the argument of this article is not that techno-based learning
is useless, or that HE in Nigeria should go back to the state it
was before deregulation that engendered privatization begun,
what it argues is the fact that the negative impacts are often
overlooked by Nigerian policy makers. For example, stu-
dents end up paying for these services they do for themselves
due to multiple fees (Moruku, 2013) and the high cost of
Internet facilities in Nigeria (Salaam & Adegbore, 2010).
This lends credence to what Ritzer (2000) notes that "ratio-
nal systems are not less expensive, they force people to do
unpaid work, and they are often inefficient" (p. 125). Because
students perform these tasks without being paid, this leads to
exploitation of the student (Ritzer & Jurgenson, 2010).
Another consequence is that the deployment of technologies
engenders job loss or insecurity (Dumbili, 2013c). This is
because many tasks hitherto performed by the nonacademic
staff are now being transferred to students and technologies,
leading to control. Therefore, nonacademic staff that previ-
ously performed these tasks are often rendered redundantly
or sacked and this will increase if HE in Nigeria is fully
McDonaldized.
Another serious implication of McDonaldization is that it
engenders malpractice. "Examination paper" leakages linked
to JAMB officials are common occurrences in Nigeria, while
those desperate students who fail to get the questions pay
some corrupt JAMB and university staff to alter their scores
(Willott, 2011) in ICT centers, often by overturning a student
"fail." Again, a dearth of data is evident in this direction, but
it was widely discussed in 2011 among staff and students of
one of the eastern-Nigerian universities that a student who
scored 37 was given 73 when she paid the large sum the ICT
staff of that university demanded. This is a tip of the iceberg
of the situation in Nigerian HE (for more on corruption and
access to Nigerian HE, see Willott, 2011). This means that
the quest for efficiency through ICT is leading to inefficien-
cies in many ways, that is, failed students are graduating,
thereby undermining the employment market and ultimately
the value of a Nigerian degree.
Calculability in the Nigerian
Universities
Calculability has to do with reification of quantity against
quality, and this has infested the Nigerian HE. One aspect of
this calculability is "target setting" (Wilkinson, 2006, p. 90)
by Nigerian universities. This is evident in the number of
students each university plans to admit yearly, teach, and
most importantly, graduate. Presently, one of the criteria for
ranking universities among the best ("calculability") is the
number of students they graduate annually (Okebukola,
2011; Okojie, 2008). Thus, universities strive to meet these
targets to make more money from their fees (through turn-
over), be in the top list, and also have their course accredited
by the "watchdog"--NUC or the "efficiency police"
(Wilkinson, 2006, p. 93). Thus, the quantities of graduates
come to matter most, and their qualities, arguably, are imma-
terial. Little wonder why many of the Nigerian graduates fail
to meet the standard required for employment because they
lack employable skills (Dabalen, Oni, & Adekola, 2001).
Another aspect of quantification is linked to the competi-
tion that occurs after the JAMB result is released. Many
schools advertise for students who originally did not choose
their institutions and those disqualified (due to low score) in
other schools are encouraged to buy their forms and take
their test. This is because the number of students who bought
the form determines the profit of the school. It should be
recalled that one of Ritzer's assertions is that "material inter-
ests" is one main factor that drives McDonaldization (Smart,
1999, p. 6), but this has a serious implication because many
of these students end up being refused admission, which
leads to a loss of money and time on the part of students.
In addition, many universities admit more students than
their facilities can sustain (Erinosho, 2007) because the num-
ber of students they have determines the amount of money
they will receive because of variable fees. Many GUs like
PUs currently run different market-based diplomas, certifi-
cates, and part-time programs with a growing number of stu-
dents. In fact, it can be argued that these programs are created
to make money and not to impart knowledge. This is because
Dumbili 9
the same number of academics is used to teach these courses,
and this leads to overloading them with work, while others
use less qualified contract or casual staff to run the programs
(Erinosho, 2007).
Publish or Perish as an Aspect of Calculability
Although in Nigeria academics have always been assessed
by their research output, previously quality was considered
more valuable than the quantity of publications. In many
Nigerian universities presently, academics are promoted to
senior positions without a single international publication
leading many Nigerian lecturers to resort to pay-as-you-
publish or "roadside journals" (Okebukola, 2010, p. 16).
Some common emerging practices are self-publication,
duplication of the same article with different titles, and argu-
ably the worst--plagiarizing other people's work. All these
lead to the publication of inferior articles just to meet up with
the "number" required for promotion (Olukoju, 2004), and
this is leading to "the ever-growing number of professors
appointed or promoted on doubtful research and publication
output" (Okebukola, 2010, p. 17). Just as Ritzer (2000) notes
that "McDonald's has always emphasised on bigness" or
quantity (p. 64), the number of publications is fast replacing
the qualities in many of these Nigerian universities where
academics get promoted irrespective of the poor quality of
research and papers they produce. Little wonder why Ritzer
(2000) notes that "any system that places much emphasis on
quantity of publication will lead to the production of a great
deal of mediocre work" (p. 69), but the implication of this is
that the poor academic standard in Nigeria may continue
because there are no new contributions to knowledge (Saint
et al., 2003).
Although these malpractices are rife in Nigeria, it must be
pointed out that some universities ensure the maintenance of
high academic standard for both staff and students. For
example, some universities such as the University of Ibadan
have an established standard for appointing and promoting
staff and still stick to such a standard to date (University of
Ibadan, 2013). In the same vein, University of Benin in 2013
sacked 44 lecturers due to their involvement in illicit prac-
tices contrary to their call to duty (Ebegbulem, 2013).
Although this can be regarded as a right step in the right
direction, the magnitude of different malpractices in the
Nigerian universities (public and private) contributes to
increasing irrationality in the system.
Another aspect of this calculability is the growing number
of Honorary Doctorate Degrees (HDD) universities award to
people with questionable characters during convocations.
Because the number of HDD any university awards deter-
mines the favor it will receive (monetary or otherwise) from
those honored, each university awards HDD to those who
have never affected the society positively or contributed to
knowledge. This recently led to a call to suspend HDD in
Nigeria, and the Lagos State Government brought it to a halt
in its state's university (Olufowobi, 2012).
Furthermore, the Nigerian government in 2011 estab-
lished nine more FGUs, again an aspect of calculability
because no effort was made to build the infrastructure before
the commencement of the universities. As this is generating
debate among Nigerians, and people are questioning the
rationale behind the establishment of the schools rather than
strengthening or expanding the existing ones (Olufowobi,
2012), the government announced the establishment of
another three universities in December 2012 ("FECApproves
Three More Varsities," 2014). Just as Ritzer (2000) contends
that, in McDonald's restaurants, the size of the food may not
be commensurate with the quality, these new FGUs are
worse than the former.
Predictability in the Nigerian
Universities
One of the predictabilities in Nigerian universities is the uni-
formity of "National Curriculum," and a similar thing was
informed in the United Kingdom via the introduction of "the
Education Reform Acts, 1988" (Wilkinson, 2006, p. 91). In
the Nigerian universities, courses, syllabuses, mode of grad-
ing, and so on are becoming the same. For example, courses
are becoming standardized (through NUC) in Nigerian HE
and this harmonized curriculum makes the faculty work with
"invisible scripts" of which deviation, according to
McDonald's principles, will obstruct the smooth flow of pro-
duction (Ritzer, 2000). This is arguably why most of the
courses are turning into garbage-in-garbage-out situations. A
Year 2 student in a typical Nigerian university, for example,
can predict what he will be taught by merely glancing
through the notes of any Year 3 student or by going through
the departmental handbook. This monotonous system gives
little or no room for innovation, suffocates skills of lecturers
and students, and makes "accidental and spontaneous knowl-
edge" or discovery unlikely.
Predictability is at play also in the NUC's routine accredi-
tation exercise that takes place every 4 years to ensure mini-
mum academic standards (Okojie, 2008). The timing of
accreditation can be predicted, thus universities prepare for
the accreditation team at any cost when the exercise is near.
Borrowing senior lecturers/professors from other schools as
adjunct staff that may not retain their tenures after the accred-
itation and promoting staff (who may not be due) are some of
the ways this can be done. In fact, the process of HE in
Nigeria can be predicted from start to finish. For example, as
one leaves secondary school, the predicted next step is to sit
for JAMB, which will be followed by the Post-JAMB. After
this first stage, there follows clearance, payment of school
fees, online registration, orientation, beginning of lectures,
and so on, in that order.
Another aspect is the recent introduction of universities'
branded uniforms such as T-shirts, caps, and so on, in some
Nigerian universities. In Nnamdi Azikiwe University
(UNIZIK), for instance, students can predict what their lec-
turers and nonacademic staff will wear to school every
10 SAGE Open
Wednesday. This is because the management has made it
compulsory for staff to buy and don the university's branded
T-shirt and cap, with stiff penalties for defaulters. This may
appear to promote the unity of the system, but according to
Ritzer (2000), it is "false fraternization" (p. 130). This can be
authenticated by the fact that UNIZIK's management out-
lawed the Labor Union for over 10 years before bowing to
pressure in 2012 (UNIZIK, 2011).
Control in the Nigerian Universities
Governance and management interference:
Ritzer (2000) claims that humans are most unpredictable,
thus McDonald's replaces them with nonhuman technology
that can be regulated at ease. In Nigerian universities, control
is extant where different types of human and nonhuman tech-
nologies have been employed to control the faculty. From the
inception of universities in Nigeria, academics enjoyed par-
tial academic autonomy, but this was short-lived following
the intervention of the military in the Nigerian politics in
1966. Successive military administrations in Nigeria gradu-
ally erased university autonomy both in the FGUs and in the
SGUs, making the Vice Chancellors puppets (Erinosho,
2007).
In fact, Odebiyi and Aina (1999) report that many univer-
sities were previously run by the military SoleAdministrators.
With military in power, HE received little funding and there
was a reckless abandon of universities' infrastructure
(Okebukola, 2006) while research was neglected due to lack
of research grants and funding (Odebiyi & Aina, 1999), lead-
ing to the exodus of academics in search of greener pastures
overseas. The situation became bleak in the 1980s and 1990s
to a point where academics were either incarcerated or
sacked for striking against government neglect of HE
(Odebiyi & Aina, 1999). A good example of lack of auton-
omy was the mass dismissal of 41 lecturers of the Obafemi
Awolowo University Ife in 2001 because they were involved
inASUU's strike. To date, the situation has not changed, irre-
spective of the fact that the Federal Ministry of Education
proposed a bill to ensure academic autonomy to the faculty
in 2000 (Onwunli & Agho, 2004).
Autonomy was further eroded via the evolvement in 1974
of the NUC (NUC, 2012); a centralized body with govern-
ment-backed power, charged with the duties of spearheading
the universities' affairs. This according to Saint et al. (2003)
was a reflection of the military structure that constituted it,
but the structure remains to date. Furthermore, the establish-
ment of the QA in the NUC (Okebukola, 2010) in 2005 sad-
dled with the responsibilities of reforming and reviewing the
universities' curriculum (Okojie, 2008), leading to
the increasing managerial interference and other activities of
the NUC such as curriculum harmonization and monitoring,
further serious threats to academic freedom in Nigerian uni-
versities. This is because management makes decisions
or implements government's policies with little or no
consultation with the faculty. In many Nigerian universities,
academics are employed by management without any input
from the faculty. Thus, those who would have had no busi-
ness being in academia are employed by their friends or rela-
tives and imposed on the faculty. Another part of this recent
occurrence is that universities are beginning to prefer the
employment of contract and adjunct staff to cut costs. This is
likely to culminate in the preference for hourly paid lecturers
because McDonaldized businesses require flexible work-
force (Ritzer, 2000).
Even the President and the State Governors have the final
say on the appointment of Vice Chancellors (Ekundayo &
Adedokun, 2009) in the FGUs and SGUs while the entrepre-
neurs appoint and dismiss the Vice Chancellors and lecturers
in the PUs. This increasing monitoring and managerial inter-
ference internally and externally where the faculty is striped
of academic autonomy will soon turn Nigerian universities
to what has been described as the "McUniversity" (Parker &
Jary, 1995). In an academic environment where the faculties
are regularized and overloaded with responsibilities (De Vita
& Case, 2003) without commensurate salary, the result is
outright "collective demoralization" of the workers
(Wilkinson, 2006, p. 94). In fact, the civic and social losses
implicated in this nutritional starvation offered by
McDonaldization of HE in Nigeria are immense. For
instance, this continuous interference, control, and neglect
have often resulted in several conflicts and strikes (internal
and external) in many Nigerian universities leading to the
closure of such institutions for several months. This can be
authenticated by the fact that due to government neglect and
failure to fund infrastructural development in Nigerian HE or
keep to its promise, ASUU recently embarked on strike in
July 2013 that lasted for 5 months ("Nigeria University
Lecturers ASUU Calls of Strike," 2013). This and other pre-
vious strikes have left the Nigerian HE to suffer intellectu-
ally (because of exodus of academics to other countries and
other related reasons), morally, democratically and most
importantly in international ranking (no Nigerian university
at present ranks among the best 1,000 universities in the
world).
Conclusion
This article revealed evidence showing that Nigerian univer-
sities are becoming fully McDonaldized and that this has
occurred since HE was deregulated in 1999. Although the
import of privatization and rationalization of HE may be
paramount to the government, this article has revealed that
many shortcomings accompany a McDonaldized system and
this may have been neglected by the policy makers.
Therefore, the government should increase university fund-
ing instead of relying on the private sector to solve the prob-
lems in its HE because the latter may only seek profit without
producing quality graduates. There should be strict monitor-
ing of the PUs to ensure that they employ qualified
Dumbili 11
manpower to teach their students, and inflation of marks
should be checked. This must be a matter of urgency because
internationally, it has been reported that privatizing HE does
not always produce quality. For example, Tilak (1991) notes
that "the higher quality of private education compared with
public higher education is exaggerated" because "private
universities are found to employ more retired, part-time, and
under-qualified teachers in Japan, Columbia, Brazil,
Argentina and several other countries" (p. 230). Because
privatization (a global phenomenon) itself is a brainchild of
World Bank often imposed on countries to qualify for loan
facilities (Patrinos, 1990), it should not be solely relied on to
remedy the problems in the Nigerian HE.
The government should grant the autonomy it promised
Nigerian universities in 2000, so that faculty can have input
to the universities' curriculum, be involved in the employ-
ment of academics and other affairs without fear of losing
their tenures.
The QA in the NUC should not just carry out govern-
ment's directives without wide consultation with academics.
This is because such may lead to resentment as it did in
Europe in the 1990s (Redding, 2005). In addition, if the edu-
cation policies are made without involving the faculty who
will implement the policies, what happened in the
McDonaldized Nigerian banking sector that engendered job
insecurity (see Dumbili, 2013a) and other irrationalities may
well occur in Nigerian academia (Dumbili, 2013c). Policy
makers and other government allies interested in the Nigerian
HE should understand that even though erosion of academic
autonomy via government interference is becoming a global
phenomenon, it must be noted that "global trends are pro-
moted, resisted and negotiated differently in each national
context and in each individual institution" (Torres &
Schugurensky, 2002, p. 429). Thus, unification of policy,
curriculum, and centralized control should be rethought by
the NUC in a way that both the rationalizers and academics
will benefit. One such way this can be done is to involve
academics in policy formulation. Again, Nigerian policy
makers should learn from countries such as Singapore that
first of all equipped their people, especially academics "with
creative and critical thinking so as to make them change-
adaptive individuals . . . in other to prepare for the challenges
of future" before implementing diverse policies in the HE
(Mok, 2000, pp. 163-164).
More staff should be employed on a full-time basis rather
than on contract terms. This will help reduce the stress most
of the faculties currently experience due to the increasing
workload. For its part, ASUU should begin to resist the casu-
alization of academia, otherwise policy makers may
soon introduce hourly paid lecturers in GUs because
McDonaldization engenders labor commodification that
leads to low pay, poor working conditions, and job
insecurity.
The reification of technology and ODL should be recon-
sidered because most students do not actually acquire sound
knowledge (Miller, 2010), and most drop out due to the high
cost. The increasing emphasis on the number of publications
instead of their quality should be discouraged if the standard
of research output is ever to increase in Nigeria. The empha-
sis on market-driven degrees should be reconsidered, and
students should be discouraged from seeing themselves as
customers because they may soon begin to decide who
among the academics should be employed, retained, or
dismissed.

Notes
1. Visitor: The President of Nigeria functions as the Visitor of
the federal government university (FGU). The laws that estab-
lished FGU stipulate that he should visit each FGU at least
once annually and grant him superior power to appoint the
Vice Chancellor of each university.
2. The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is a
federal government agency established in 1978 to harmonize
the higher education (HE) admission criteria and procedures.
3. The Post-University Matriculation Examination (PUME) is a
post-JAMB entrance examination introduced by the federal
government in 2005. Its aim is to allow each university to
further screen all its prospective students that passed JAMB
examination before offering them admission.
