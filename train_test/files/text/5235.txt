Introduction
Most of the traditional grammar written on classical Arabic
depended on what native speakers of the language judged to
be grammatical. However, this form of classical Arabic has
seen dwindling interest and the once widely spread and pres-
tigious style of communication is presently confined to reli-
gious and some literary texts. Instead, the modern standard
Arabic is now prevalent and dominates the media, although
its use too is limited to official register and is often learned
rather than acquired. Nevertheless, the treatment of prenomi-
nal and postnominal adjectives in both classical and modern
standard Arabic remains indistinguishable for the most part.
Adjectives in Arabic normally follow the nouns they
modify. Thus, the following order is commonly found in
Arabic:
(1) 
Determiner Phrase (DP) + Noun Phrase (NP) +
Adjective Phrase (AP).
In (1), both the DP and the NP precede the AP. However,
it is the intrinsic property of some adjectives to precede the
NP they modify (Fassi Fehri, 1999), yielding the following
order:
(2) DP + AP + NP.
This short article expounds on the status of adjectives in
Arabic. It argues that Kremers's (2003) analysis of prenomi-
nal and postnominal adjectives, which rests on the notion of
definiteness inheritance, presents a challenge for the X-bar
theory, is structurally superfluous and non-economic, and
can generate ungrammatical structures. The article sets forth
an alternative minimalist account that posits a single under-
lying structure for both prenominal and postnominal APs. In
particular, it is argued that the definiteness feature weakness
or strength determines the AP prenominal versus postnomi-
nal status in the DP.
Adjectives in Arabic
Positive Adjectives
Positive adjectives usually follow the nouns they modify and
agree with them in number, gender, case, and definiteness.
Consider the following examples:
(3) bint-u-n jameel-at-u-n
girl-nom-indef pretty-fem-nom-indef
"a pretty girl"
(4) al-bint-u al-jameel-at-u
def-girl-nom def-pretty-fem-nom
"the pretty girl"

Prenominal and Postnominal Adjectives in
Arabic: A Proposed Analysis
Mahmoud S. Al Mahmoud1
Abstract
This article discusses the status of prenominal and postnominal adjectives in Arabic. It is argued that Kremers's treatment of
adjectives is non-economic as it generates two different syntactic representations for prenominal and postnominal adjectives.
It also undermines endocentric properties of phrasal projections and fails to correctly predict the definiteness status of
adjectival construct state heads. The article proposes an alternative analysis with a single underlying syntactic structure
for both types of adjectives. The need to have nominal features of the specifier (Spec) of the agreement phrase head
(Agr) checked and licensed within the determiner phrase (DP) triggers leftward noun phrase (NP) movement, thus forming
postnominal adjectives. In prenominal adjectives, however, the strong Definiteness Feature (DEF) on the determiner (D)
causes the adjective phrase to raise to the specifier of the DP.

The adjective jameel-at-u-n "pretty" in (3) and al-jameel-
at-u "the pretty" in (4) both agree with the preceding nouns
bint-u-n "a girl" and al-bint-u "the girl" respectively in num-
ber (singular), gender (feminine), case (nominative), and
definiteness.1
Positive adjectives can, however, occur prenominally in
which case they do not bear any case, gender, number, or
definiteness agreement with the noun they modify:
(5) (al)-jameel-u al-wajh-i
def-pretty-nom def-face-gen
"(the one with) the pretty face"
The definite marker on the adjective (al)-jameel-u "the
pretty" is optional and is not the result of definiteness agree-
ment with the noun al-wajh-i "the face." The adjective here
with the noun forms a construct state (CS; see "Definiteness
and the CS" section) as apparent from the genitive case end-
ing -i on the nominal complement. It should be noted that the
construction in (5) is not very common and is more likely to
be found in classical Arabic.
Comparative Adjectives
Comparative adjectives can only occur postnominally, but
unlike positive adjectives, they do not agree with the noun
preceding them in gender or number.2 Rather, comparative
adjectives have to adhere to the form of Af'al Attafdheel3 and
be followed by the min "than" prepositional phrase:
(6) al-bint-u (al)-akbar-u min ukht-i-ha
def-girl-nom (the)-older-nom than sister-gen-her
"the girl (who) is older than her sister"
(7) al-awlaad-u (al)-akbar-u min akhawaat-i-him
def-boys-nom (the)-older-nom than sisters-gen-their
"the boys (who) are older than their sisters"
The comparative adjective (al)-akbar-u "(the) older"
modifies a singular feminine noun al-bint "the girl" in (6)
and a plural masculine noun al-awlaad-u "the boys" in
(7). Although the adjective has to agree with the noun in
case, agreement in number, gender, or definiteness is
non-obligatory.
Superlative Adjectives
The superlative adjective is constructed in Arabic using the
singular genderless Af'al form. However, unlike compara-
tive adjectives, superlatives are unique in Arabic in that they
can occur prenominally or postnominally:
(8) al-walad-u al-akbar-u
def-boy-nom def-oldest-nom
"the oldest boy (of a known group of boys)"
(9) akbar-u walad-i-n
oldest-nom boy-gen-indef
"the oldest boy"
(10) akbar-u al-awlaad-i
oldest-nom def-boys-gen
"the oldest of the boys"
In (8), the superlative adjective al-akbar-u "the oldest"
follows the noun al-walad-u "the boy" and shows agree-
ment in definiteness and case. However, in (9) and (10), the
superlative precedes the nouns walad-i-n "boy" and al-
awlaad-i "the boys" but shows neither definiteness nor case
agreement. In both (9) and (10), the adjective constitutes
the head of a CS with the following NP as the genitive com-
plement. Lipinski (1997) discussed the various types of
adjectives in Semitic languages (see also Abd Al-Ghani,
2000; Qanbaar, 1988, among others). He states that the pat-
tern Af'al is used for the superlative and may then take the
definite article as in (8) or be defined by a genitive as in (9)
and (10). In its prenominal use, the superlative adjective
conveys a greater degree of the attribute compared with
postnominal superlatives (Kremers, 2003).
Construct State
There is little discussion in the literature of the adjectival CS.
Most of the work centers on the nominal CS, mainly in
Hebrew and Arabic (Fassi Fehri, 1999; Siloni, 1997 among
others). A CS is the structure where the noun or the adjective
is annexed to a genitive DP. Moscati (1964) defined the CS
as
the special form taken by a noun when it is defined by a
following genitive (or prenominal suffix). The two nouns cannot
be separated, though there are certain exceptions to this rule.
(pp. 100-102)
The CS can be either nominal composed of the head noun
followed by the genitive DP as in (11), or it can be adjectival
in which case the head adjective is annexed to the genitive
DP as shown in (12):
(11) Nominal CS.
qalam-u al-walad-i
pen-nom def-boy-gen
"the boy's pen"
Al Mahmoud 3
(12) Adjectival CS.
akbar-u walad-i-n
oldest-nom boy-gen-indef
"the oldest boy"
The NP construction in (11) expresses possessiveness.
The CS head qalam-u "pen" (the possessed) assigns its com-
plement the DP al-walad-i "the boy" (the possessor) the
genitive case -i. The adjectival CS in (12) is very similar to
the nominal one structurally but rather expresses the superla-
tive meaning of the adjective; the adjective akbar-u "oldest"
is the head of the CS, and the noun walad-i-n "boy" is the
genitive DP complement.
The genitive case on the CS DP complement is believed
to be structural because the genitive DP can assume different
thematic roles in Arabic. It can be the subject, possessive,
object, or agent in a sentence. Lindauer (1995) argued that
the German genitive can have numerous thematic roles and
thus concluded that the DP genitive case is structural.
Similarly, Longobardi (1995) and De Wit (1997) argued that
if the genitive noun can assume a number of theta roles, then
the genitive case is structural.
Definiteness and the CS
Traditionally, grammarians stipulate that the superlative
form of the adjective be definite (and singular). Moscati
(1964) noted how the CS in Semitic languages is closely
connected with the function of definiteness and indefinite-
ness (see also Borer, 1984; O'leary, 1969). When postnomi-
nal, the superlative bears the overt definiteness marker al
"the" as in (8). However, in its (CS) prenominal use, it
acquires definiteness via annexation to the complement
regardless of the DP definiteness status as in (9) and (10). In
other words, the superlative adjective in Arabic has to be
always definite either via prefixation of the definiteness arti-
cle or by constituting the CS head.
Evidence for the inherent definiteness of CS heads can be
found for example in the ungrammaticality of the
following:
(13) *al-akbar-u walad-i-n
def-oldest-nom boy-gen-indef
"the oldest boy"
(14) *al-akbar-u al-awlaad-i
def-oldest-nom def-boys-gen
"the oldest of the boys"
The ungrammaticality of (13) and (14) is due to double
definiteness of the superlative by the definite article al- "the"
and by being the head of the CS. As stated above, because
prenominal superlatives constitute the first element of a CS,
they are inherently definite, and as such, cannot realize the
overt definiteness marker.4
Further evidence for definiteness of the CS can be found
in the use of adjectives modifying nominal heads in
DP-possessive structures:
(15) qalam-u al-walad-i al-jadeed-u
pen-nom def-boy-gen def-new-nom
"the boy's new pen"
The positive adjective al-jadeed-u "the new" in (15)
describes qalam-u "pen" and agrees with it in number (sin-
gular), gender (masculine), definiteness (definite), and case
(nominative). Such definiteness agreement on the adjective
argues that the CS head qalam-u "pen" is in fact definite.
Kremers's Analysis of Postnominal and
Prenominal Adjectives
Kremers (2003) proposed an analysis of postnominal and
prenominal adjectives in Arabic according to which two syn-
tactically different structures are posited. Consider the fol-
lowing representation of the positive and superlative
adjectives stated earlier in (4) and (10), respectively:
(16) Postnominal adjectives.
In (16), the positive adjective al-jameel-at-u "the pretty"
constitutes the AP that occurs after the noun al-bint-u "the
girl" and is syntactically adjoined to the right of the number
(Num) phrase. Whereas (16) is proposed for postnominal
adjectives, the representation in (17) below is proposed for
prenominal adjectives:
(17) Prenominal adjectives.

4 SAGE Open
In (17), the superlative adjective akbar-u "oldest" pre-
cedes the DP al-awlaad-i "the boys." On par with the nomi-
native and accusative case assignment of the subject and the
object by T and by little v, respectively, (Chomsky, 1995) and
given the fact that genitive case assignment is structural, the
genitive case is therefore assigned by a functional head,
namely, possessive (POSS) (Delsing, 1993; Longobardi,
1995; Szabolcsi, 1994; Valois, 1991). Kremers (2003)
assumed that the POSS head is a projection of the feature
POSS that has the value [±POSS] and determines whether
the head adjective in the construction has a DP dependent. If
the value of POSS is set as [+POSS], then it carries an addi-
tional set of unvalued  features that need to be valued via an
Agree relation with the DP complement that is assigned the
genitive case:
The head Poss has the value [+POSS] in addition to a set of
unvalued -features. Because the -features are unvalued, Poss
is active and tries to value these features. It probes its c-command
domain for an active match; it finds a match in the complement
DP which is active because it has an unvalued CASE feature. A
match is established and the unvalued features of both sides are
valued. (p. 37)
The assumption is that in a CS structure, the feature POSS
must always be valued as [+] that requires a set of unvalued
 features to be valued through Agree. The unvalued  fea-
tures are matched with the unvalued CASE feature (genitive)
of the DP complement.
Kremers (2003), after Fassi Fehri (1999), assumed that
the head of a CS is unmarked for definiteness. That is, it has
neither the definite article al- "the" nor the indefinite marker
-n. Instead, the CS head receives its definiteness value via
definiteness inheritance from its complement DP. If the geni-
tive DP is definite as in (18), then the head noun, namely,
darraaj-at-u "bike" would be definite and if the DP comple-
ment is indefinite as in (19), then the head noun will be indef-
inite as can be discerned from the definiteness status of the
modifying adjective in the following examples:
(18) darraaj-at-u al-awlaad-i al-saree-at-u
bike-fem-nom def-boys-gen def-fast-fem-nom
"the boys' fast bike"
(19) darraaj-at-u awlaad-i-n saree-at-u
bike-fem-nom boys-gen-indef fast-fem-nom
"boys' fast bike"
Given the agreement in case, definiteness, gender, and
number between postnominal adjectives and the nouns they
modify, the definiteness of the adjective saree "fast" in (18)
and its indefiniteness in (19) result from its agreement with
the CS head darraaj-at-u "bike." One may be led to believe
that agreement with the DP complement awlaad-i-n "boys"
is what determines the adjectival definiteness. This is not the
case, however, as the adjective (al)-saree-at-u "(the) fast"
shows case, number as well as gender agreement with the CS
head and not with the genitive DP. The adjective has the
same nominative -u, not genitive -i, case as the first element
of the CS darraaj-at-u "bike"; is not plural as the DP com-
plement; and carries the same feminine marker as the CS
head, namely, -at.
Furthermore, Kremers assumes that definiteness inheri-
tance is a result of Agree. The DEF feature gets valued in the
course of the derivation through Agree. D enters the derivation
with a valued or unvalued DEF depending on the value of the
POSS feature. In other words, if POSS has the value [-POSS]
(i.e., when the head noun has no genitive complement), DEF
enters the derivation already valued as either the definiteness
marker al- "the" or the indefiniteness marker -n. However, if
POSS is valued as [+POSS], DEF is unvalued with neither the
definite article al- nor the indefinite marker -n.
Discussion
Kremers's (2003) analysis outlined in (16) and (17) is struc-
turally non-economical as it postulates two markedly differ-
ent syntactic representations for prenominal and postnominal
APs. Second, the analysis assumption of a hybrid category
with two heads, namely, D/POSS, in the NP is unattractive. It
compromises the endocentric property of X-bar phrases that
requires "all phrases be headed by one head" (Haegeman,
1994, p. 105), and "every head project a phrase and that all
phrases have heads" (Hornstein, Nunes, & Grohmann, 2005,
p. 168). Third, the two features of the hybrid category D/
POSS inexplicably stand in a converse relationship: When
POSS has the value [+POSS], DEF is forced to remain unval-
ued and vice versa. It is not clear what causes this trade-off
between the two features.
Moreover, the stipulation that [+POSS] renders DEF
unvalued and must therefore appear without the definite al-
or indefinite -n marker seems to be contradicted by the kind
of data mentioned in "Positive Adjectives" section (repeated
here in (20) for convenience):
(20) (al)-jameel-u al-wajh-i
def-pretty-nom def-face-gen
"(the one with) the pretty face"
Although the definite article on the CS head adjective
(al)-jameel-u "(the) pretty" is optional, (20) still presents a
problem for Kremers's (2003) analysis that mandates that
POSS be always valued as [±POSS] whenever in CSs. Such
condition requires DEF also to be unvalued (i.e., without the
definite article al- "the" or the indefinite marker -n).
However, this is not the case in (20) as the DEF feature is
indeed valued for definiteness with the definite article al-
being realized, albeit optionally, on the adjective (al)-jameel-
u "(the) pretty." In other words, positive prenominal
adjectives pose serious problems for an analysis that assumes
a value mismatch between POSS and DEF.
Al Mahmoud 5
Finally, the notion of CS heads acquiring definiteness
from DP complements (definiteness inheritance) seems to be
undermined by examples involving conjoined adjectives
such as the following:
(21) ajmal-u bint-i-n wa* (al)-atwal-u
pretties-nom girl-gen-indef and def-tallest-nom
"the prettiest and tallest girl"
Recall that under definiteness inheritance, the definiteness
of the CS head is dependent on and acquired by the genitive
DP complement. CS heads inherit their definiteness value
from the complement to which they are annexed (i.e., if the
CS complement is definite, the head would be definite and
vice versa). Thus, in (21), the CS head ajmal-u "prettiest" is
predicted to be indefinite after its DP complement bint-i-n
"girl." However, note that the conjoined adjective al-atwal-u
"the tallest" in (21) is in fact definite and carries the same
nominative case ending -u as the CS head adjective ajmal-u
"prettiest." Clearly al-atwal-u "the tallest" cannot be in agree-
ment with the CS complement bint-i-n "girl" because the lat-
ter has different case (genitive -i) and gender (feminine)
endings, and is specified for indefiniteness (-n). Therefore, it
follows that the definiteness on the adjective al-atwal-u "the
tallest" in (21) results from agreement with the superlative CS
head ajmal-u "prettiest." This indicates that the CS head
adjective in (21) is indeed definite although overt definiteness
morphology is lacking. To sum up, a definiteness inheritance
analysis fails to account for the inherent definiteness of CS
heads as it would incorrectly predict the CS head adjective
ajmal-u "prettiest" in (21) to be indefinite based on the indefi-
niteness of the DP complement bint-i-n "girl."
Proposed Analysis
Rather than positing two different structures in the analysis
of prenominal and postnominal adjectives, an alternative
analysis that makes reference to one unified syntactic struc-
ture is proposed. The following tree schema is suggested for
both prenominal and postnominal adjectives in Arabic:
(22) 
Syntactic representation of prenominal and postnom-
inal adjectives in Arabic.
To explain how postnominal and prenominal adjectives
can be derived from the tree diagram in (22), consider the
following representation for postnominal adjectives:
(23) 
Syntactic representation of postnominal adjectives in
Arabic.
The NP in (23) raises to the specifier of the agreement
phrase (AgrP). I assume after Cinque (2005) that what is
triggering the NP movement is the need for extended pro-
jections of the NP to be licensed. I also assume, after
Koizumi (1995) and the argument made therein for the
existence of agreement phrases in Minimalist Syntax, that
the head category Agr has a maximal projection, namely,
AgrP. In (23), the AgrP specifier's need for a nominal fea-
ture to be licensed within the DP triggers the movement of
the NP to [Spec-Agr].5 I assume further that D has a weak
DEF (definiteness) feature that does not cause the move-
ment of the AP to the specifier of the DP. However, to
account for the elative form of postnominal superlatives, I
assume that the adjective acquires the elative morphology
by entering an Agree relation with [Spec-DegP] (Chomsky,
2000).
Now consider the following tree structure for prenominal
adjectives:

The tree structure of prenominal adjectives in (24) is iden-
tical to that of postnominal adjectives in (23); however, con-
trary to (23), D is said to have a strong DEF feature in (24)
that triggers the movement of the AP to the specifier of the
DP. The AP undergoes movement first to [Spec-AgrP] then
to [Spec-DegP] to acquire the elative (or superlative) mor-
phology6 and ultimately to [Spec-DP] to check the strong
definiteness feature on the determiner. Being in a spec-head
relation with the determiner, the adjective acquires definite-
ness and functions as a determiner in the sense that it singles
out the most salient member of a set. Because the AP move-
ment blocks the movement of the NP to the specifier of the
agreement phrase, [Spec-AgrP] has to acquire the nominal
feature that licenses its presence in the DP some other way.
Following Cinque (2005), I assume that licensing is done
through Merge. That is, the specifier of the agreement phrase
acquires the nominal feature through an Agree relation with
the NP. In this manner, the extended projection of the NP is
licensed without resorting to movement of the NP to [Spec-
AgrP], which would otherwise be impossible due to [Spec-
AgrP] being already occupied with the AP.
Note that the analysis proposed in (22), unlike that of
Kremers (2003), does not resort to hybrid maximal projec-
tions. The maximal phrase is headed by one single head,
namely, D, which is a projection of the DP; thus, endocen-
tricity of phrasal projections in the X-bar theory is respected.
In addition, problematic data for the definiteness inheritance
approach are easily accounted for under this analysis.
Consider the NP in (21) above where, contra to definiteness
inheritance, the adjective ajmal-u "prettiest" was argued to
be definite although its genitive DP complement is not.
According to (22), the adjective ajmal-u "prettiest" moves
first to [Spec-AgrP], then to [Spec-DegP] to acquire the ela-
tive form, and eventually to [Spec-DP] for checking the
strong definiteness feature in D.
Finally, it is more adequate for economy considerations to
postulate a unified syntactic representation for both to differ-
ent but related APs. The thrust of the argument is that the
syntactic representations in (23) and (24) are isomorphic and
the distinction between prenominal and postnominal adjec-
tives is syntactically reduced to the featural strength of the
definiteness feature on the determiner. In other words, the
choice of whether an adjective occurs prenominally or post-
nominally is constrained by the definiteness feature in D. If
D has a weak definiteness feature, then the AP is postnomi-
nal, and if D has a strong definiteness feature, then the AP is
prenominal.
Evidence for Noun Phrasal Movement
in Postnominal Adjectives
Taking into account postnominal adjectives, the analysis pro-
posed in the previous section assumes the movement of the
whole NP to the specifier of the agreement phrase. Evidence
for such movement of the NP can be found in constituency
tests designed to reveal the syntagmaticity and wholeness of
a syntactic unit. For space limitations, I consider here two
tests of constituency: modification and coordination.
Noun Complement Modification
Recall that the underlying representation or the deep struc-
ture (DS) for postnominal adjectives places the modified NP
to the right of the AP before moving it to the left of the adjec-
tive at the surface structure (SS) level:
(25) DS: al-jameel-at-u sayyar-at-u al-walad-i
def-pretty-fem-nom car-fem-nom def-boy-gen
SS: sayyar-at-u al-walad-i al-jameel-at-u
car-fem-nom def-boy-gen def-pretty-fem-nom
"the boy's beautiful car"
In (25), the CS head sayyar-at-u "car," along with its gen-
itive complement al-walad-i "the boy," moves to a preadjec-
tival position. The derivation that takes place in (25) is
depicted in the following tree diagram:
(26) Syntactic representation of postnominal adjectives in
Arabic.
Now consider the following example where the NP under-
goes partial movement:
(27) *sayyar-at-u al-jameel-at-u al-walad-i
car-fem-nom def-pretty-fem-nom def-boy-gen
"the boy's beautiful car"
The ill-formedness of (27) stems from the head of the CS
sayyar-at-u "car" moving to the spec of AgrP without its
genitive complement al-walad-i "the boy." The example in
(27) can only be grammatical if the whole NP (the noun

AP

along with its complement) moves to [Spec-AgrP]. The con-
stituency of the NP as exemplified here can be taken as evi-
dence for whole noun phrasal movement rather than head
movement to the specifier of the agreement phrase in post-
nominal adjectives.
Coordination
As mentioned earlier, movement to the spec of the agreement
phrase targets whole NPs rather than single nominal heads.
Therefore, in NPs made up of two or more conjoined nouns,
the single head along with its coordinated noun is expected
to undergo movement as in (28):
(28) DS: al-jameel-at-u al-kilaab-u wa al-?usood-u
def-pretty-fem-nom def-dogs-nom and def-lions-nom
SS: al-kilaab-u wa al-?usood-u al-jameel-at-u
def-dogs-nom and def-lions-nom def-pretty-fem-nom
"the pretty dogs and lions"
Note the full agreement between the two coordinated nouns
al-kilaab-u "the dogs" and al-?usood-u "the lions" in case,
number, and definiteness. According to the analysis of post-
nominal adjectives so far proposed, the NP constituent left-
joins the specifier of AgrP as shown in the following diagram:
(29) Syntactic representation of postnominal adjectives in
Arabic.
In (29), the entire NP moves to [Spec-AgrP] where it is
modified by the adjective al-jameel-at-u "the pretty." Partial
NP movement, however, would render the structure
ill-formed:
(30) *al-kilaab-u al-jameel-at-u wa al-?usood-u
def-dogs-nom def-pretty-fem-nom and def-lions-nom
"the pretty dogs and lions"
The illicitness of (30) is due to raising the noun al-kilaab-
u "the dogs" to [Spec-AgrP] without the coordinated noun
al-?usood-u "lions." This presents further evidence that the
movement involved in (23) cannot be single head movement
of the noun.
Finally, the fact that when NP-to-[Spec-AgrP] movement
occurs, it always affects the determiner al- "the" lends more
credence to the claim that phrasal rather than single head
movement takes place in postnominal adjectives as shown in
the ungrammaticality of the following example:
(31) *bint al-jameel-at-u al-
girl def-pretty-fem-nom def-
"the pretty girl"
The NP in (31) moves without its determiner al- "the" to
the specifier of the agreement phrase as illustrated in (32):
(32) Syntactic representation of postnominal adjectives in
Arabic.
The diagnostics above indicate that the noun movement in
postnominal adjective constructions is indeed a movement of
the maximal projection NP rather than a movement of the

Conclusion
This article has dealt with postnominal and prenominal
adjectives in Arabic. It was argued that although Kremers's
(2003) analysis captures some generalizations of the CS in
Arabic, it is not without its shortcomings. It presents a seri-
ous challenge to one important endocentric tenant of the
X-bar theory: single head projection of phrases. Furthermore,
in addition to assuming two distinct syntactic represent
ations for postnominal and prenominal adjectives, the

analysis fails to account for some new emergent data. In par-
ticular, definite adjective conjunctions with CS heads pose
some problems for a definiteness inheritance account. An
alternative minimalist approach with one unified syntactic
representation accounts for prenominal and postnominal

adjectives. Strong definiteness of D in prenominal adjec-
tives triggers AP movement to [Spec-DP], whereas lack of it
and the need for nominal features within the DP to be
licensed in postnominal adjectives trigger NP movement to
[Spec-AgrP]. Tests of constituency, namely, NP modifica-
tion and coordination, provide clear evidence for NP-phrasal
vis-à-vis single head movement to the specifier of the agree-
ment phrase.

Notes
1. The definite marker in Arabic is the prefix al- "the."
Indefiniteness is signaled by the clitic "-n," a nunation marker
that appears after case on indefinite nouns and proper names.
2. Agreement in definiteness with the noun is optional, and dif-
ferent readings may be obtained depending on whether the
adjective bears the definite article al- "the" or not. One of the
reviewers noted that a zero-copula reading of the examples
in (6) and (7) emerges when the comparative adjectives are
indefinite. In such case, the adjectives would be predicative.
However, a noun phrase (NP) reading is obtained when the
adjectives are definite and are considered, therefore, attributive.
3. The form Af'al is used to derive comparative as well as super-
lative adjectives from positive adjectives in Arabic, for exam-
ple, the comparative/superlative form of the positive adjective
jameel "pretty" is ajmal "prettier/prettiest." Af'al can also be
used to express exclamation in Arabic.
4. Similarly, in nominal construct states (CS), the head noun can-
not bear the definite article as it is already defined by annexa-
tion to the complement:
*al-qalam-u al-walad-i
def-pen-nom def-boy-gen
"the boy's pen"
5. Cinque (2005) also maintained that in addition to NP move-
ment, [Spec-AgrP] can acquire the nominal feature by Merge
that enters an Agree relation with the NP without movement.
He pointed out that whereas some languages use movement
and others use Agree, still some make use of both.
6. Where the adjective appears in the non-elative form (i.e., posi-
tive prenominal adjectives), I assume that Deg has null elative
morphology.
