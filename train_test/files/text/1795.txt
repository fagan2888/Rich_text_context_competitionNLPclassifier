Background: There have been no recent US population-based es-
timates of syphilis seroprevalence. We determined the prevalence of
syphilis seroreactivity among a representative sample of the US pop-
ulation.
Methods: Sera from 18- to 49-year-old participants in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2001­2004 were tested for
syphilis IgG antibody using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Speci-
mens with positive or indeterminate EIAs underwent rapid plasma
reagin (RPR) testing; RPR titers >1:8 were considered positive. Spec-
imens with RPR titers <1:8 underwent confirmatory testing with
Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA).
Results: Sera were available for 5767 participants. EIA testing was
positive or indeterminate for 126, of which 10 had RPR titers >1:8. Of
the remaining 116 specimens, 60 had positive TP-PA tests, including
all 19 with RPR titers >1:1. Overall weighted syphilis seroprevalence
was 0.71% (95% CI: 0.51­0.96). Prevalence was similar among males
(0.76%) and females (0.67%) and increased with age, less education,
and lower income (P <0.001 for each). Non-Hispanic blacks had the
highest prevalence (4.3%), followed by Mexican-Americans (0.98%)
and non-Hispanic whites (0.07%; P <0.001).
Conclusions: The prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity was low
(0.71%) in the general US population of 18- to 49-year-olds. However,
consistent with surveillance data, this nationally representative survey
showed substantial disparities in syphilis by race/ethnicity.
EFFORTS TO CONTROL SYPHILIS in the United States have
broadened in recent years, with launching of the National Plan to
Eliminate Syphilis from the United States in 19991 and release of
an updated Syphilis Elimination Effort action plan in 2006.2 How-
ever, there has not been a national population-based measure of
syphilis seroprevalence in 25 years.3 Syphilis surveillance in the
United States has relied largely on case reports submitted by state
and local health departments and seroprevalence monitoring
among specific high-risk populations (e.g., in jails), which have
been useful in following trends in early syphilis to gauge the
effectiveness of prevention efforts.4 However, case report data
may underestimate the true burden of syphilis, due to such factors
as lack of screening among many asymptomatic infected persons
and underreporting of diagnosed cases. In addition, case reporting
and selection biases may contribute to the marked racial disparities
seen for syphilis, in which blacks are disproportionately affected.4
Blacks may be more likely to attend public clinics where case
reporting is thought to be most complete, and may be overrepre-
sented at the limited sites where screening occurs. We analyzed
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) 2001­2004 to determine the prevalence of positive
serologic tests for syphilis among a representative sample of the
US population aged 18 to 49 years.
Methods
Study Population and Survey Design
The NHANES 2001­2004 were continuous annual surveys con-
ducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.5 Each year, a
complex, stratified, multistage probability sample design was used
to select a representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutional-
ized US population of all ages. Race/ethnicity categories in
NHANES were defined by self-report as non-Hispanic (NH) white,
NH black, and Mexican-American. Persons who did not fit into
one of these categories, including those who reported being "mul-
tiracial" were classified as "other" and included in the total pop-
ulation. NH blacks and Mexican-Americans were sampled at a
higher rate compared with other racial/ethnic groups to allow
sufficient sample sizes for analysis.
Each survey participant was interviewed and underwent a stan-
dardized health examination and biologic specimen collection.
Data on sexual behavior were collected using audio computer-
assisted self-interview, and sex was defined as vaginal, oral, or
anal sex. NHANES participants were not asked about a prior
clinical diagnosis of syphilis. All participants tested for syphilis

were given an opportunity to obtain their test results by telephone
using a password-protected system. Reminder letters were sent to
adults and phone calls were made to minors to encourage partic-
ipants to learn their test results. Participants with positive tests
received standardized counseling messages and were referred to
health care providers for evaluation and possible treatment.
Protocols for the NHANES 2001­2004 were evaluated and
approved by the institutional review board of the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Written, informed consent
was obtained from all survey participants.
Laboratory Methods
Sera from 18- to 49-year-old NHANES 2001­2004 participants
were evaluated at CDC using serologic tests for syphilis infection
according to a standardized algorithm based on screening with a
treponemal test, a strategy found to have favorable performance in
other settings.6­8 Detailed methods for all laboratory tests in the
algorithm, including cut-off values for positive and indeterminate
results, are documented on the NHANES Web site.9 All specimens
were first tested for syphilis IgG treponemal antibody using an
enzyme immunoassay (EIA). During 2001 to November 2002, the
Captia Syphilis-G EIA was used.10­12 However, because of avail-
ability issues with the Captia test, during November 2002, all EIA
testing was switched to the Trep-Chek Syphilis EIA.13,14 Perfor-
mance of the two EIA tests was comparable on internal quality
assurance evaluations (side-by-side testing). Specimens with pos-
itive or indeterminate EIAs (of either type) underwent nontrepo-
nemal rapid plasma reagin (RPR) testing.15,16 Specimens with
nonreactive RPRs or RPR titers 1:8 underwent confirmatory
testing with Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA).17
The algorithm for defining a final determination of syphilis
infection was as follows. Specimens with a positive or indetermi-
nate EIA and an RPR titer 1:8 were considered to be positive for
syphilis, and more likely to reflect recent infection. Specimens
with a positive or indeterminate EIA, a nonreactive RPR or an
RPR titer 1:8, and a positive TP-PA were considered to be
positive for syphilis, and more likely to reflect remote infection.
Specimens with a negative EIA or a negative TP-PA were con-
sidered to be negative for recent or remote syphilis infection.
Statistical Analyses
SUDAAN software version 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute,
Cary, NC) was used for statistical analyses to incorporate sampling
weights and account for the clustered sample design in calculating
variance estimates based on a Taylor Series approximation. All
seroprevalence estimates were weighted to represent the total US
civilian, noninstitutionalized population and to account for over-
sampling and nonresponse to the household interview and physical
examination. We estimated weighted syphilis seroprevalence over-
all and by selected demographic and behavioral variables. Bivari-
ate significance tests for association were based on a Wald 2
statistic with 2-sided P-values. The confidence intervals for the
prevalence estimates were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson
method.18,19 The critical values used for the confidence intervals
were based on the t-distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to
the number of strata minus the number of primary sampling units.
Relative standard errors (RSEs) were computed for each
weighted estimate as (SE/Estimate)*100. An RSE 30% is
considered unstable and the corresponding estimate should be
interpreted cautiously.
We also performed a weighted analysis of the positive predic-
tive value (PPV) of the EIA screening test, alone and in combi-
nation with RPR results, for a final determination of syphilis
infection as defined by our laboratory testing algorithm. The PPV
was defined as the proportion of initially positive tests that were
ultimately determined to represent syphilis infection, after ac-
counting for the sampling methods of NHANES 2001­2004.
Results
A total of 25, 917 individuals were selected to participate in
NHANES 2001­2004. The overall response rate to the interview
was 82%. Of 6540 18- to 49-year-olds interviewed, 95.9% were
examined, and 91.9% of those tested for syphilis. Overall, 5767
specimens underwent syphilis EIA testing; testing algorithm re-
sults are shown in Figure 1. EIA testing was positive or indeter-
minate for 126 specimens, of which 10 had RPR titers 1:8. Of
the remaining 116 specimens, 60 had positive TP-PA tests. All 19
specimens with an RPR titer 1:1 had a positive TP-PA, versus 41
of 97 nonreactive specimens.
The prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity among 18- to 49-year-
olds in the United States was 0.71% (95% CI: 0.51­0.96; Table 1).
Prevalence of syphilis infection with a nonreactive RPR or RPR
titer 1:8 (more likely remote infection) was 0.63% (95% CI:
0.44­0.87) and that of higher titer infection (RPR titer 1:8, more
likely recent infection) was 0.08% (95% CI: 0.03­0.20); however,
the latter estimate had a RSE 30% and should be interpreted with
caution. Table 1 shows overall syphilis seroprevalence (both recent
and remote infection) according to selected characteristics. Sero-
prevalence was similar among males and females (0.76% vs.
0.67%; P  0.59) and increased with age, less education, and
lower income (P 0.002 for each). NH blacks had the highest
seroprevalence (4.3%), followed by Mexican-Americans (0.98%)
and NH whites (0.07%; P 0.001), although small numbers of
syphilis cases among NH whites made a precise estimate unreli-
able (RSE 30%).
Syphilis seroprevalence was higher among those who had first
sex before the age of 15 years than among those whose first sex
was later (1.5% vs. 0.45%, P  0.006; Table 1). Seroprevalence
was also higher among persons reporting 5 lifetime sex partners,
compared with those with 5 lifetime partners (P 0.001). Small
numbers of men reporting a history of a same-sex sex partner and
those reporting homosexual, bisexual, or "other" sexual identity
limited our ability to make reliable estimates of syphilis seropreva-
lence among men who have sex with men (MSM). Although
syphilis seroprevalence was slightly higher among men who had a
history of a same-sex sex partner (1.4%) and among those who
self-identified as nonheterosexual (2.2%) compared with those
who did not (0.6% for each), these differences were not statisti-
cally significant. Among the 28 NHANES participants with a
positive HIV test, syphilis seroprevalence was 13.3%.
Table 2 shows the PPV of the EIA screening test, alone and in
combination with RPR results, for a final determination of syphilis
infection as defined by our laboratory algorithm. Of 112 specimens
with positive EIAs, 69 were ultimately determined to be positive
for syphilis, yielding a weighted PPV of 48%. In other words, 52%
of all positive screening EIAs were ultimately deemed to be false
positives. All 28 specimens with a positive EIA and a reactive RPR
(titer 1:1) were determined to be positive for syphilis (PPV:
100%), whereas only 41 of 84 specimens with positive EIAs and
nonreactive RPRs had syphilis (PPV: 37%). Of 14 specimens with
indeterminate EIAs, only 1 (with an RPR titer of 1:4) had syphilis.
Discussion
We found that the prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity was low
(0.71%) in the general, noninstitutionalized US population of 18-

to 49-year-olds. However, there were marked racial disparities in
syphilis infections, with NH blacks disproportionately affected.
This nationally representative survey supports surveillance data;
case reporting and selection biases are unlikely to play a major role
in explaining apparent racial disparities.4 Because positive trepo-
nemal serologic tests are a marker for lifetime syphilis infection,
the magnitude of disparity among racial/ethnic groups does not
necessarily reflect current differences in syphilis infections, but
rather differences in cumulative incidence for each group over the
previous approximately 15 to 20 years. The magnitude of the
differences between NH blacks and NH whites in NHANES
2001­2004 was comparable to that observed in 1992 national
surveillance data, where the black:white rate ratio was 62:1. It
is encouraging that the black:white rate ratio in surveillance
data has subsequently decreased to 5.4:1 in 2005.4
Although progress has been made in reducing racial disparities
in syphilis in recent years, reports of outbreaks and increased
numbers of primary and secondary syphilis cases among MSM
have been on the rise.20­23 In fact, currently more than 60% of new
syphilis infections are estimated to occur in MSM.23 In our anal-
ysis, small numbers of MSM made precise syphilis seroprevalence
estimates unreliable. Syphilis seroprevalence appeared to be higher
in MSM, but differences by MSM status were not statistically
significant. Since we evaluated lifetime syphilis infections that
may have occurred over many years, recent increases may not have
been as apparent. In addition, the NHANES surveys are not
well-suited for evaluating low prevalence diseases like syphilis in
small subpopulations such as MSM that have not been explicitly
oversampled. Groups of MSM with high-risk behavior and high
syphilis rates that are localized within a few urban centers may be
missed with the broad, population-based sampling for NHANES.
In addition to evaluating seroprevalence, we used the NHANES
data to evaluate laboratory screening with treponemal tests. Tra-
ditionally, testing for syphilis in the United States has relied on
screening with a nontreponemal test followed by a confirmatory
treponemal test. However, many sites in the United States are
adopting initial screening with treponemal tests, instead of non-
treponemal tests, because of economic and logistical consider-
ations,24 and several have documented that treponemal-based
screening algorithms are a reasonable alternative to algorithms
based on nontreponemal screening, with comparable sensitivity,
specificity, and predictive values.6­8 Screening with our trepone-
mal testing algorithm identified 41 specimens that were deter-
mined to be positive for syphilis (59% of all those found), which
would have been missed with nontreponemal RPR screening.
Some of these may have represented either very early or very
longstanding latent syphilis infection, situations that might still
benefit from therapy. However, lack of information on prior diag-
nosis and treatment makes it unclear whether these had clinical or
public health importance. The PPV of screening EIA in our as-
sessment was 48%. Even with very specific treponemal tests, we
would predict a substantial number of false positives in a very low
prevalence population, so the PPV we observed was not out of the
range of what might be expected. When a positive screening EIA
was followed by a reactive RPR (of any titer), the PPV was 100%
for a final determination of syphilis infection, suggesting that
confirmation with another treponemal test would not be necessary
in this scenario. However, the PPV of the screening EIA was much
lower if the follow-up RPR was nonreactive. In this scenario,
confirmatory testing might be helpful, although interpretation of
results is not always clear. Although a positive second treponemal
test would likely confirm a syphilis infection, a negative second

SYPHILIS SEROREACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES
treponemal test might represent a false positive on the first test or
a false negative on the second; for purposes of our analysis, we
assumed the first test to be falsely positive. Use of treponemal tests
for syphilis screening will require careful consideration of clinical
and therapeutic histories when treponemal tests are positive in the
setting of nonreactive nontreponemal tests.
Our analysis had several limitations. First, low prevalence led to
unstable estimates for many subpopulations, including NH whites
and MSM. Second, syphilis treponemal seroreactivity indicates
infection at any time over a lifetime, and so these estimates do not
shed light on new or untreated syphilis infections in recent years.
Categorization as "recent" or "remote" infection using RPR titer
will undoubtedly result in misclassification, and the number of
infections we identified with RPR titers 1:8 was too small to
make reliable estimates. Third, no information about a reported
history of diagnosed or treated syphilis was available; thus, we
could not determine the extent of undiagnosed syphilis infections
in the United States. Finally, the previous assessment of national
syphilis seroprevalence, from NHANES II (1976­1980),3 in-
volved a nontreponemal-based screening algorithm using 3 differ-
ent tests from those used in the current assessment, including the
automated reagin test, which has not been available as a nontrepo-
nemal screening test for years.25,26 Because of this, and the fact
that race/ethnicity was categorized differently in NHANES II, we
felt we could not accurately evaluate trends in syphilis seroreac-
tivity over time.
In conclusion, we found a low prevalence of lifetime syphilis
infection in the general population of US 18- to 49-year-olds.
However, consistent with surveillance findings, these nationally
representative data underscore the disproportionate impact of
syphilis on NH blacks in the United States. Although the racial gap
in syphilis infections has narrowed substantially since the 1990s,4
continued efforts to minimize these racial disparities remain a
major national priority.2 Future efforts will also need to address the
burgeoning epidemic of syphilis among MSM.
