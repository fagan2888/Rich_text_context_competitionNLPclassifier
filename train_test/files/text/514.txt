Abstract
Background: Previous studies have demonstrated gaps in achievement of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goals
among U.S. individuals at high cardiovascular disease risk; however, recent studies in selected populations indicate
improvements.
Objective: We sought to define the longitudinal trends in achieving LDL-C goals among high-risk United States adults from
1999­2008. Methods We analyzed five sequential population-based cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys 1999­2008, which included 18,656 participants aged 20­79 years. We calculated rates of LDL-C goal
achievement and treatment in the high-risk population.
Results: The prevalence of high-risk individuals increased from 13% to 15.5% (p = 0.046). Achievement of LDL-C ,100 mg/
dL increased from 24% to 50.4% (p,0.0001) in the high-risk population with similar findings in subgroups with (27% to
64.8% p,0.0001) and without (21.8% to 43.7%, p,0.0001) coronary heart disease (CHD). Achievement of LDL-C ,70 mg/dL
improved from 2.4% to 17% (p,0.0001) in high-risk individuals and subgroups with (3.4% to 21.4%, p,0.0001) and without
(1.7% to 14.9%, p,0.0001) CHD. The proportion with LDL-C $130 mg/dL and not on lipid medications decreased from
29.4% to 18% (p = 0.0002), with similar findings among CHD (25% to 11.9% p = 0.0013) and non-CHD (35.8% to 20.8%
p,0.0001) subgroups.
Conclusion: The proportions of the U.S. high-risk population achieving LDL-C ,100 mg/dL and ,70 mg/dL increased over
the last decade. With 65% of the CHD subpopulation achieving an LDL-C ,100 mg/dL in the most recent survey, U.S. LDL-C
goal achievement exceeds previous reports and approximates rates achieved in highly selected patient cohorts.

Introduction
LDL-C reduction is a central component of coronary heart
disease (CHD) risk reduction [1]. Over the past two decades
numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that lowering LDL-C
reduces cardiovascular risk [2­11]. Individuals at highest risk of
a cardiovascular event derive the greatest benefit from lowering of
LDL-C and achievement of LDL-C goals [12]. In the United
States, clinical guidelines have been modified to reflect the
importance of LDL-C goal achievement in high-risk individuals.
In 1993, the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult
Treatment Panel (ATP) II [13] recommended an LDL-C goal of
,100 mg/dL for patients with CHD. In 2001, the ATP III added
CHD ``equivalent'' conditions to the population appropriate for
an LDL-C of ,100 mg/dL [1]. In 2004, an ATP III update
presented an optional high-risk goal of an LDL-C ,70 mg/dL
[12]. Despite the importance of LDL-C reduction, an achievement
gap in U.S. individuals at high cardiovascular risk has been
described [14­15]. One year after the ATP III recommendations
to treat those at high risk to an LDL-C ,100 mg/dL, only 32% of
the high-risk population in the U.S. met this goal [14]. Over the
past decade there has been an increase in the availability of potent
lipid-lowering therapies and increasing evidence supporting the
benefits of LDL-C reduction [16]. With increasing knowledge,

education, and treatment options the previously described gap in
LDL-C goal achievement in high-risk individuals may have
improved. In 2005, 62% of U.S. CHD patients in a very select
physician group achieved an LDL-C ,100 mg/dL [17]. A recent
report analyzed the prevalence of high LDL-C levels across
different risk levels in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999­2006 and found the
prevalence of high LDL-C in the U.S. population across each
risk category to be improving over the study period [18]. The
longitudinal trends in U.S. LDL-C goal achievement at both the
ATP III LDL-C goal of ,100 mg/dL and the 2004 optional
LDL-C goal of ,70 mg/dL among the high risk subgroups over
the past decade have not been described. Defining LDL-C goal
achievement among the high-risk population and respective
subgroups offers an opportunity to examine treatment gaps and
identify patient populations to target with preventative therapies.
The purpose of our analysis was to describe the longitudinal
changes in the prevalence of LDL-C goal achievement in high-risk
individuals from 1999­2008 in the U.S. population.
Methods
The National Center for Health Statistics performs the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in two-year
increments to define the health and nutritional status of the United
States population. The NHANES utilizes complex, stratified,
multistage sampling techniques based on demographic and
geographical data, assigning subjects a weight such that the sum
represents a statistical model of the entire civilian non-institution-
alized United States population. Methods involve identification of
primary sampling units, within which, clusters of households are
identified with each person in the household screened for
demographic characteristics. The NHANES database has been
used to develop national health standards, [19] assess disease
prevalence, [20­23] identify risk factors for disease development
and management, [24­25] and assess the health of the nation [26­
27]. Detailed information on NHANES data collection is
published and available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.
htm.
Inclusions/Exclusions
We analyzed five NHANES surveys: 1999­2000, 2001­2002,
2003­2004, 2005­2006, and 2007­2008. Included participants
were ages 20­79 years and met the ATP III definition of ``high
risk'' (see below). We excluded participants who were pregnant,
received chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the exam, lacked
complete lipid data including (missing total cholesterol, high
density lipoprotein levels, LDL-C, or triglycerides) or blood
pressure data or had triglyceride measurements $400 mg/dL.
(Table 1).
High Risk Criteria
We defined ``high risk'' according to U.S. ATP III guidelines
[28] that included those participants with known CHD or one or
more CHD risk equivalent conditions including diabetes mellitus,
cerebrovascular disease, or the presence of two or more ATP III
risk factors and a Framingham risk score $ 20% [28]. CHD was
defined in the NHANES dataset by self-reported history of
myocardial infarction, CHD or angina pectoris. Diabetes mellitus
was defined in the NHANES dataset by self-reported history of
diabetes or of taking insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic medica-
tions. Cerebrovascular disease was defined in the NHANES
dataset by self-reported history of a stroke. The number of ATP III
risk factors were summed: age (men $45 years or women $55
years), hypertension (blood pressure $140/90 mmHg or use of
antihypertensive medication), tobacco use (smoked 100+ lifetime
cigarettes and currently smoking), family history of early CHD
(defined in NHANES as subjects reporting a heart attack or angina
in grandparents, parents or siblings ,50 years of age) and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ,40 mg/dL. An HDL-C
$60 mg/dL led to subtraction of one risk factor. Framingham risk
scores were calculated using formulas provided by the Framing-
ham study (Available at: http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/
risk/hrdcoronary.html).
Lipid Goal Achievement
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated
using the Friedewald equation, regardless of fasting status [14,29­
30]. Weighted mean LDL-C concentrations were calculated for
those at high-risk and for the subsets with and without CHD. We
evaluated achievement of both the ATP III LDL-C goal of
,100 mg/dL and the 2004 optional LDL-C goal of ,70 mg/dL.
To determine those participants who remained eligible for
pharmacotherapy initiation or intensification we evaluated the
high-risk subset with an LDL-C $130 mg/dL. We divided this
group into those with and without CHD, and further divided both
groups based on medication use.
Statistical Analysis
The NHANES data sets from 1999­2008 were downloaded and
imported into Microsoft Excel (version 11.2 for Macintosh,
Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) and into SAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Appendix S1 describes the list of NHANES
item codes and descriptions. To account for the complex survey
design of NHANES, SAS PROC SURVEYMEANS was used to
calculate standard errors using the Taylor Linearization method
[31]. The 95% confidence intervals for estimated population
parameters, p-values for differences in parameters between
adjacent surveys and p-values for tests of trend over time were
calculated using the Wald method. A two-tailed p-value of less
than 0.05 was considered to be significant.
Results
Prevalence of High-Risk Conditions
The prevalence of high-risk participants in the entire eligible
population increased from 13.0% in 1999­2000 to 15.5% in
2007­2008 (p for trend 0.046) (Table 2). The prevalence of the
high-risk subgroup with CHD did not significantly change over the
time period of the five surveys (range 4.9% to 6.4% p = 0.33). The
subgroup of high-risk participants without CHD increased from
7.5% in 1999­2000 to 10.6% in 2007­2008 (p for trend = 0.002).
The prevalence trends of the diabetes mellitus subgroup increased
from 5.6% to 8.6% (p for trend = ,0.0001) and the cerebrovas-
cular disease subgroup increased from 1.8% to 2.7% (p for
trend = 0.032) over the five surveys. The subgroup of high risk
with two or more risk factors and a Framingham risk score $20%
(range 2.2% to 3.3% p = 0.85) did not change significantly.
LDL-C Levels in High-Risk Individuals
The mean LDL-C levels of the entire high-risk population and
its subgroups with and without CHD significantly decreased over
the time period of the five surveys (Table 3). The mean LDL-C in
the 1999­2000 survey was 128.1 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) (95% CI,
122.8­133.4 mg/dL); this decreased to 106.5 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/
L) (95% CI, 102.9­110.1 mg/dL) in 2007­2008 (p,0.0001). In
the high-risk subgroup with CHD, the mean LDL-C in 1999­
2000 was 123.2 mg/dL (3.2 mmol/L) (95% CI, 117.3­129.1 mg/

dL), this level decreased to 98.3 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) (95% CI,
92.8­103.7 mg/dL) in 2007­2008 (p,0.0001). In the subgroup of
high-risk participants without CHD, the mean LDL-C decreased
from 131.7 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) (95% CI, 125.4­138 mg/dL) in
1999­2000 to 110.3 mg/dL (2.9 mmol/L) (95% CI, 105.3 ­
115.3 mg/dL), in the 2007­2008 survey (p,0.0001).
Achievement of LDL-C ,100 mg/dL in High-Risk
Participants
Achievement of LDL-C ,100 mg/dL (,2.6 mmol/L) in high-
risk participants increased from 24% in 1999­2000 to 50.4% in
2007­2008 (p for trend ,0.0001, Table 3). Achievement of LDL-
C ,100 mg/dL for the subgroup with CHD increased from
27.0% to 64.8% (p for trend ,0.0001); high-risk participants
without CHD also increased, from 21.8% to 43.7% (p for trend
,0.001) [Table 3]. In the 2007­2008 survey, achievement of
LDL-C ,100 mg/dL in the CHD subset (64.8%) was significantly
greater than in the subset without CHD (43.7%, p,0.0001).
Achievement of LDL-C ,70 mg/dL in High-Risk
Participants
From the 1999­2000 to the 2007­2008 survey, the proportion
of high-risk participants achieving an LDL-C ,70 mg/dL
(,1.8 mmol/L) increased from 2.4% to 17.0% (p,0.0001). The

High-Risk Participants with LDL-C $130 mg/dL and Not
on Lipid Medications
The proportion of high-risk participants with LDL-C
$130 mg/dL ($3.4 mmol/L) decreased from 44.4% to 23.8%
(p,0.0001) from 1999­2000 to 2007­2008. In the subset of
participants with CHD, the proportion decreased from 37.2% to
18% (p,0.0001); in the high-risk subset without CHD the
proportion decreased from 49.7% to 26.5% (p,0.0001). Overall,
there was a significant reduction in the number of untreated high
risk with LDL-C .130 mg/dL. In 1999­2000, 35.1% of the high-
risk population with an LDL-C $130 mg/dL was not on lipid
medication. This proportion decreased to 18% in the 2007­2008
survey (p = 0.0002). In 1999­2000, 25% of participants with CHD
were not on lipid medications and had an LDL-C $130 mg/dL.
This increased to 11.9% in 2007­2008 (p = 0.0013). In the
subgroup of high-risk participants without CHD, 42.6% were not
on lipid medication and had an LDL-C $130 mg/dL in 1999­
2000. This proportion increased to 20.8% in 2007­2008
(p,0.0001).
Discussion
Primary Findings
This study describes U.S. improvements in LDL-C goal
achievement in high cardiovascular risk populations over the last
decade. Improvements were observed in participants at high risk,
both with and without CHD; and at three LDL-C thresholds:
,100 mg/dL, ,70 mg/dL, and $130 mg/dL not on lipid
medications.
Historical Context of LDL-C Goal Achievement in CHD
Studies from the 1980s in the U.S. demonstrated improvements
in LDL-C goal achievement in the subset of the high-risk
population with CHD. Analyses of the NHANES III survey
described LDL-C goal achievement rates between 16.6%­18.0%
in individuals with CHD [32­34]. A survey of primary clinicians
performed in 1993 found that only 14% of the high-risk
population achieved the recommended LDL-C goal of less than
100 mg/dL [35]. A comparison of the 1999­2000 and 2001­2002
NHANES survey demonstrated improved achievement of LDL-C
,100 mg/dL from 27% to 41% [14]. In 2004, the NCEP
Evaluation ProjecT Utilizing Novel E-Technology (NEPTUNE)
II, a nationwide survey that recruited from the top 26% statin-
prescribing physicians evaluated 4,885 patients with dyslipidemia
and reported that 57% of all high-risk patients and 62% of CHD
patients achieved LDL-C levels below 100 mg/dL [17]. In 2006­
2007, The multinational Lipid Treatment Assessment Project (L-
TAP) 2 study evaluated 9,955 dyslipidemic patients on lipid-
lowering therapy. Of the 5,930 high-risk individuals with CHD,
82% were on statin therapy and 67% reached their country's
respective goal LDL-C [36]. While these studies provided
optimism that achievement of LDL-C goals was improving, they
were performed in highly selective clinician or patient cohorts.
This study, in contrast, measures LDL-C goal achievement
levels in an U.S. representative high-risk population, providing
a comparison for historical cohort studies of LDL-C goal
achievement. Improvements in achieving an LDL-C ,100 mg/
dL goal appeared to occur in plateaus following the release of the
ATP III guideline in 2001 [28] and ATP III update guidelines in
2004 [12]. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study it is not
possible to determine causality; however, release of guidelines may
be one explanation for the timing of these improvements. Our
study provides optimism that LDL-C goal achievement trends in
the United States are improving and are consistent with the high
goal achievement rates seen in highly selective cohorts.
CHD Compared with Non-CHD High Risk
LDL-C goal achievement improved in both the ``high risk with
CHD'' subgroup and the ``high risk without CHD'' subgroup over
the time period of the five surveys (p,0.0001 for both).
Furthermore, the subgroup of ``high risk with CHD'' had
significantly higher rates of LDL-C ,100 mg/dL (p,0.0001)
and lower rates of LDL-C $130 mg/dL (p = 0.02) compared with
the ``high risk without CHD'' subgroup in the 2007­2008 survey.
The ``high risk without CHD'' subset had a higher rate of LDL-C
$130 mg/dL and not on lipid medications (20.8%) compared
with the ``high risk with CHD'' subset (11.9%, p = 0.0099). The
observed differences in LDL-C goal achievement and lipid
medication use between the CHD and non-CHD subsets are
likely the result of multiple causes. The high risk without CHD
population in this analysis included those with diabetes mellitus,
the presence of two or more ATP III risk factors and
a Framingham risk score $ 20% or cerebrovascular disease.
The lipid goal achievement gap in diabetic patients has been well
described in the literature and represents numerous factors from
failure to treat to the difficulty of clinical inertia in clinical practice.
[37­39] The LDL-C achievement gap in individuals at high risk
by Framingham risk score alone may be due to under recognition.
Cardiovascular risk score calculation is low within primary care
practices, with one report indicating cardiovascular risk calcula-
tion rates of ,17% in primary care offices [40]. Thus, the failure
to treat this group with two or more risk factors and a Framingham
risk score may be the result of not appropriately identifying
patients at risk. The lack of LDL-C goal achievement in those
patients high risk secondary to cerebrovascular disease may also
represent a combination lack of knowledge of lipid goals and
clinical inertia. The importance of use of lipid lowering medication
in patients with CHD is well established with a ,30% reduction in
CHD mortality. The benefits of lipid lowering medications in
patients with a history of ischemic stroke is less well established
with relative risk reductions ranging from 14­21% [41­42].
Whatever the underlying reasons may be for the LDL-C
achievement gap between the high risk populations with and
without CHD this finding underscores the need to target
educational and awareness efforts at high-risk patients without
established CHD.
Limitations/Strengths
This is a serial cross-sectional analysis with limitations inherent
to the NHANES survey, including statistical modeling and
selection bias. The generalizability of these findings outside the
U.S. population may be limited as the NHANES are a population
based statistical model of the entire civilian noninstitutionalized
United States population. The NHANES questionnaires rely on
self-report and may be subject to misunderstanding and recall bias.
NHANES does not include incarcerated or institutionalized
individuals. Some of the NHANES variables do not match the
definitions set forth in the ATP III guidelines precisely so some
misclassification may have occurred. For example, the NHANES
defines a positive family history of CHD as a parent or
grandparent experiencing a myocardial infarction or angina
under the age of 50 years without gender differentiation. The
ATP III guideline defines a positive family history of CHD as a risk
factor if CHD afflicts a first degree male relative under the age of
55 years, or a first degree female relative under the age of 65 years
[28]. The NHANES survey does not include testing for aortic
aneurysms, a history of aortic surgery and does not include

a question regarding claudication. Also, the NHANES survey
stopped collecting data on ankle-brachial index after the 2003­
2004 survey. This could result in an underestimation of those with
peripheral vascular disease. However, those eligible for inclusion
with ankle-brachial indices ,0.9 represent a very small portion of
the high risk population. Responses to questions regarding current
use of lipid medications are subject to recall bias and mis-
understanding. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design of
NHANES makes the treatment effects of the lipid medications
impossible to assess.
Conclusion
Overall, the United States population at high risk for
cardiovascular disease experienced significant increases in the
proportion of individuals achieving LDL-C goals of ,100 mg/dL
and ,70 mg/dL. There also has been a significant decline in the
proportion of the high-risk population with LDL-C $130 mg/dL
and not on lipid medications.
