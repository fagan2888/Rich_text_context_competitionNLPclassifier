Why Does The Number Of
Uninsured Americans
Continue To Grow?
Gains in employer coverage, caused by workers' shifting into higher-paying
jobs, have not offset declines in Medicaid coverage.
by John Holahan and Johnny Kim
Declining employer-sponsored cover-
age from the 1970s to the mid-1990s
has been attributed to a variety of fac-
tors: the shift from manufacturing to service-
sector jobs, increased temporary and part-
time employment, decreasing unionization, a
decline in real wages, and growth in health
care costs.1 During the late 1980s and early
1990s this decline was partially offset by large
increases in Medicaid coverage, which served
to slow increases in the uninsurance rate.2
In this paper we use data from the Current
Population Survey (CPS) to compare changes
in insurance coverage over a more recent pe-
riod, 1994­1998, with those in the period
1989­1993. During the latter years some of the
conditions that caused the earlier reduction in
employer-sponsored coverage and increases
in the uninsurance rate reversed. The econ-
omy emerged from the 1990­1992 recession
and had a sustained period of rapid economic
growth. Real incomes rose, and the growth in
health care costs slowed.3 In addition, the ex-
pansions of Medicaid coverage to children
and pregnant women had been largely phased
in and were no longer a source of significant
growth, and state welfare reform efforts began
to adversely affect Medicaid enrollment.4 We
examine the 1994­1998 period in greater
depth to show changes in insurance coverage
for various subgroups.
Reasons For Two Study Periods
In addition to the strong economy and
changes in welfare/Medicaid policies, the
other reason for breaking study periods be-
tween 1993 and 1994 is that two major
changes were made to the CPS that make
comparisons of trends before and after 1993/
1994 inappropriate. Both changes began with
the March 1995 survey: a revision of the health
insurance coverage questions, and the intro-
duction of a new sample framework. The re-
vised questionnaire included separate, more
detailed questions about employer-sponsored
and private nongroup health insurance, state-
specific names for Medicaid, a new set of
questions for out-of-household coverage, and
a catch-all question for insurance. The order
of the health insurance questions also was
changed at this time. No longer did questions
regarding public types of health insurance
come first; the health segment of the March
1995 survey started with questions about pri-
vate health coverage. The primary impact of
these changes was to increase the number of
persons reporting employer-sponsored cover-
age, reduce the number with private non-
group coverage, and increase the reported
health insurance coverage of children.5
Several methodological problems with the
measurement of insurance coverage in the
CPS have been documented.6 Perhaps the

most important relates to a debate over
whether respondents are reporting current
coverage or any coverage they had over the
past year. If they are reporting current cover-
age, then the number of uninsured should be
interpreted as those who lack health insur-
ance at a point in time. If they are reporting
any coverage in the past year, then by defini-
tion a residual count of the uninsured would
be a count of those who lacked coverage for
the entire year. There has been considerable
debate of this issue. Although it has not been
resolved, it is nonetheless clear that the CPS
has generally been consistent across time,
which is what is important for this study.
A second issue is that the CPS appears to
consistently understate Medicaid coverage, as
shown in comparison with estimates from
states and federal administrative data. Be-
cause Medicaid may be understated, the
number of uninsured persons is likely to be
overstated. Again, although this is a problem,
there is no reason to believe that the extent of
it is changing significantly over time.
Results
The proportion of the nonelderly population
without insurance increased from 16.2 per-
cent in 1989 to 18.2 percent in 1993 (Exhibit
1).7 The rate of uninsurance among children
increased from 16.4 to 17.0 percent, and among
adults, from 16.1 to 18.8 percent. For both chil-
dren and adults, employer-based coverage fell,
particularly for dependents. Increases in
Medicaid coverage partially offset these de-
clines, for both groups.8 The growth in Medic-
aid coverage along with small increases in
other public and private nongroup coverage
was not sufficient to offset both the decline in
the rate of employer-based coverage and
population growth. Thus, the number of unin-
sured persons rose during 1989­1993.
The population of nonelderly persons who
were uninsured grew again during 1994­1998,
from 17.3 percent to 18.4 percent, or by 4.2
million. The uninsurance rate for children in-
creased from 14.5 percent to 15.6 percent, and
for adults, from 18.6 percent to 19.7 percent.
But the increases in the latter period occurred
for different reasons. First, there was a drop in
Medicaid coverage from 10.0 percent to 8.4

percent, or about 3.1 million persons (1.9 mil-
lion children and 1.2 million adults). Also,
other public coverage fell from 2.7 percent to
2.4 percent (0.5 million); this was due princi-
pally to reductions in military-related cover-
age. Other private coverage also declined,
from 5.7 percent to 5.0 percent (1.2 million),
possibly reflecting the increased cost of health
insurance in the private nongroup market.
These reductions in Medicaid, other pub-
lic, and private nongroup coverage would
have resulted in even greater increases in the
uninsured had it not been for increases in em-
ployer-sponsored coverage. The number of
adults covered through employers rose about
6.1 million, while the number of dependent
children covered rose by 3.3 million (Exhibit
1). Thus, unlike in the previous period, the
increase in employer-sponsored coverage
kept the number of uninsured from growing
more rapidly than it otherwise would have.
n Changes in coverage by income
group (1994­1998). The period 1994­1998
was noteworthy because of the rapid growth
in the U.S. economy, as seen in the analysis of
coverage by income levels (Exhibit 2).9 For
the population below 200 percent of the fed-
eral poverty level, there were significant re-
ductions in Medicaid enrollment and in pri-
vate nongroup coverage. The declines in
Medicaid enrollment all occurred for persons
with incomes below 100 percent of poverty;
reductions in private nongroup coverage oc-
curred both below 100 percent of poverty and
100­200 percent of poverty. Because of these
declines, the number of uninsured persons
with incomes below 200 percent of poverty
rose by 0.8 million. The increases would have
been larger had it not been for the strong
economy, which reduced the total number of
people below 200 percent of poverty.

3.1 million seems to be more attributable to
the drop in the likelihood of coverage than to
the decline in the number of persons with in-
comes below 200 percent of the federal pov-
erty level. Using data from Exhibit 2, we esti-
mate that if the Medicaid enrollment rate had
stayed at its 1994 level, Medicaid enrollment
would have fallen by about 1.3 million because
of the decline in the low-income population.
Alternatively, if the low-income population
had grown at the national population growth
rate but the Medicaid enrollment rate had de-
clined as it did, Medicaid enrollment would
have fallen by 2.1 million. On this basis, we
estimate that more than 60 percent of the de-
cline in Medicaid coverage is associated with
reduced probability of coverage.
Those in the middle income group (200­
399 percent of poverty) had a 1.5-percentage-
point drop in the likelihood of employer-
sponsored coverage. This was almost com-
pletely responsible for the increase in the
uninsurance rate from 12.1 percent to 14.1 per-
cent. The increase in the uninsurance rate to-
gether with a small increase in the number of
people in this income group resulted in an
increase of 1.5 million uninsured persons.
For those at the high end of the income
distribution (400 percent of the federal pov-
erty level and higher), Medicaid and other
public programs are relatively unimportant.
Between 1994 and 1998 the number of unin-
sured persons rose from 4.6 percent to 6.1 per-
cent, or by 1.8 million. This was mostly ex-
plained by reductions in employer-sponsored
coverage (from 89.4 percent to 88.5 percent)
and by the large increase in higher-income
adults and children. It is noteworthy that the
number covered by employers increased by
11.2 million, but this was not sufficient to
match the substantial population growth
(13.3 million) in this income range.
In sum, these results mean that during
1994­1998 low-income populations were ad-
versely affected by significant reductions in
Medicaid and not helped much by the rise in
employer-based coverage. They also experi-
enced substantial drops in private nongroup
coverage. The number of uninsured among
families with incomes below 200 percent of
poverty increased by 0.8 million. Had it not
been for a decline of 5.1 million in the total
number of persons below 200 percent of pov-
erty, the increase in the number of low-income
persons who were uninsured would have been
much higher. A drop in the share of higher-in-
come adults and children with employer-
sponsored coverage, coupled with the growth
in their numbers, resulted in nearly two mil-
lion more uninsured persons in this category.
n Coverage of children and adults. Ex-
hibit 3 provides further detail on changes in
coverage for children and adults by income
level. Insurance coverage of children is of par-
ticular interest because of the recent expan-
sion to cover low-income children through
the State Children's Health Insurance Pro-
gram (SCHIP). Between 1994 and 1998 the
share of children below 200 percent of pov-
erty with employer-sponsored coverage in-
creased; this was more than offset by a decline
in Medicaid coverage. Low-income children
also experienced a drop in other public cover-
age (almost wholly military-related coverage)
and private nongroup coverage. The result
was an increase in the uninsurance rate from
23.4 percent to 26.5 percent. However, be-
cause 1.7 million fewer children were in fami-
lies with incomes below 200 percent of pov-
erty, the number of uninsured children rose
by a relatively small 600,000. The rate of unin-
surance rose for both income groups above
200 percent of the federal poverty level. As a
result of these increases, together with changes
in income distribution, half of the increase in
the number of uninsured children occurred
among those above 200 percent of poverty.
Insurance coverage of adults is of interest
because so many more adults are uninsured
than children. In 1998, 19.7 percent of adults
(32.0 million) were uninsured, compared
with 15.6 percent of children (11.9 million).
Interestingly, the rate of employer-sponsored
coverage fell for both of the two highest in-
come groups, and there was no change for the
lowest. However, because there is much more
rapid growth in the number of adults above
400 percent of poverty where rates of em-

ployer-sponsored coverage are also higher, the
result is an increase overall in the proportion
of the population with employer-sponsored
coverage. In absolute numbers, 6.1 million
adults gained employer-sponsored coverage.
Between 1994 and 1998, the uninsurance
rate among adults rose from 18.6 percent to
19.7 percent, or about 3.0 million adults. For
adults below 200 percent of the federal pov-
erty level, the increase in the uninsurance rate
was principally attributable to the drop in
Medicaid and to a reduction in private non-
group coverage. For adults above 200 percent
of poverty, the increases were attributable to
declines in the rate of employer-sponsored
coverage. Because of rising incomes, almost all
of the growth in the number of uninsured
adults occurred above 200 percent of poverty.
n Coverage by race and ethnicity. Ex-
hibit 4 provides data for white non-Hispanics,
black non-Hispanics, and Hispanics. (Not
shown is a residual "other" group that is quite
small, only 11.9 million in 1998.) Over the pe-
riod 1994­1998 all groups experienced a sig-
nificant increase in the number of uninsured.
The number of white non-Hispanics without
health insurance increased by 700,000 (3.4
percent); the number of black non-Hispanics,
by 1.1 million (17.4 percent). The Hispanic
group, which had the highest uninsurance
rate to begin with, had a 2.0 million increase
in the number of uninsured (21.5 percent).
Employer-sponsored coverage among white
non-Hispanics rose by 4.2 million, all explained
by the large number who movedup the income
distribution. The rate of employer-sponsored
coverage actually fell for those above 200 per-
cent of the federal poverty level. White non-

Hispanics were less reliant on Medicaid than
the other groups were but saw a major decline
in Medicaid enrollment, again largely the re-
sult of movement up the income distribution.
The number of uninsured persons in this group
rose because of both population growth and
declines in theprobabilityofhavingMedicaidor
other public or private nongroup coverage. The
drop in private nongroup coverage was par-
ticularly sharp below 200 percent of poverty.
Among black non-Hispanics employer-
sponsored coverage rose by 1.4 million per-
sons. This is, again, almost completely ex-
plained by the movement of individuals and
families up the income distribution, where
the likelihood of employer-based coverage
was higher. Black non-Hispanics were more
reliant on Medicaid than whites were, and
they were affected by the decline in Medicaid
enrollment. Among low-income black non-
Hispanics, the percentage on Medicaid fell
from 37.7 percent in 1994 to 32.8 percent in
1998, a drop of 1.2 million persons. The in-
crease in employer-based coverage in this
group was not sufficient to offset the declines
in Medicaid and population growth--hence
the increase of 1.1 million uninsured.
Hispanics experienced a large increase in
an already high number of uninsured. This
group also had a significant increase in em-

ployer-sponsored coverage (2.6 million). This
is explained both by an increase in coverage
among those with low incomes and by rising
incomes. This group, however, was heavily re-
liant on Medicaid and was affected by the
drop in Medicaid enrollment, which fell by
700,000. For Hispanics with incomes below
200 percent of poverty, the percentage on
Medicaid declined from 29.5 percent to 23.3
percent. Because of the increase in the number
of Hispanics (15 percent overall growth dur-
ing 1994­1998, including an increase of 1.5
million below 200 percent of poverty) and the
decline in Medicaid enrollment, the number
of uninsured Hispanics rose by 2.0 million.
This accounted for almost half of the increase
in the overall number of uninsured.
n Coverage by work status. Data on in-
surance coverage by household members'
work status are of interest because the rapidly
improving economy resulted in a decline in
nonworkers and increases in the number of
working families (Exhibit 5). Between 1994
and 1998 the number of nonworkers fell by 2.6
million, and part-time workers, by 0.8 million;
in contrast, the number of adults in families
with one full-time worker increased by 6.4
million, and in families with two full-time
workers, by 5.7 million.
Between 1994 and 1998 the uninsurance
rate increased or stayed constant for each of
these groups. For those with two full-time
workers, there was a slight decline in em-
ployer, other public, and private nongroup
coverage, resulting in an increase in the unin-
surance rate from 9.7 percent to 11.2 percent.
For families with one full-time worker, the
rate of employer-sponsored coverage stayed
relatively constant; however, primarily be-
cause of reductions in other public and pri-
vate nongroup coverage, the proportion of un-
insured increased from 18.5 percent to 19.0
percent. Among families of nonworkers, the
uninsurance rate rose from 23.7 percent to
30.4 percent. Most of this is explained by de-
creases in Medicaid coverage, which dropped
from 46.1 percent to 34.2 percent. An increase
in the uninsurance rate among nonworkers
had less of an impact on the overall uninsur-
ance rate, because the size of this group de-
clined. Moreover, the increase in the overall
uninsurance rate was dampened because
more people moved from part-time work or
nonworking status to full-time work, where
fewer people were uninsured.
Discussion And Policy
Implications
Our analysis has shown that the uninsurance
rate in the United States has continued to rise
despite a strong economy. However, the rea-
sons for the increase since 1994 have been fun-
damentally different from those in the years
immediately before 1994. The rate of em-
ployer-based coverage has actually risen
across the nonelderly population. However,
this has been more than offset by declines in
Medicaid and in private nongroup coverage.
The increase in employer-sponsored cover-
age would seem to be a reversal of previous
patterns. However, we also find that within
each of two higher-income groups, the decline
was statistically significant. It was the move-
ment of people into higher income brackets,
where rates of employer-sponsored coverage
are higher, that was responsible for the overall
increase in both the rate and the number of
persons with employer-sponsored coverage. The
slowing rate of growth in health care costs, cou-
pledwith increasing real incomes, also probably
kept the decline in employer-sponsored cover-
age, even withinincome groups, relatively small.
We also found that private nongroup cov-
erage declined overall. However, the propor-
tion of persons with private nongroup cover-
age fell most sharply for those below 200
percent of poverty. One possibility is that
high premiums in this market may have made
private nongroup coverage unaffordable for
many lower-income families.
The decline of 3.3 million in Medicaid dur-
ing 1994­1998 is perhaps most troubling.
Some of this may be the result of the improved
economy, but much is probably related to
state and federal welfare reform. While the
number of persons below 200 percent of pov-
erty fell sharply, the likelihood of a low-
income person's being on Medicaid fell sig-

nificantly as well. Reductions in Medicaid en-
rollment among low-income persons were
particularly striking for blacks and Hispanics.
Uninsurance rates have risen within all in-
come groups. For those below 200 percent of
poverty, the reductions in Medicaid and in
private nongroup coverage have more than
offset any increases in employer-sponsored
coverage. For higher-income groups, the de-
cline in employer-sponsored and private non-
group coverage has caused the uninsurance
rate to rise. Because the number of low-
income persons fell, the number of uninsured
increased by only 0.8 million. Because the
number of high-income persons grew sharply,
the number of uninsured increased by 1.8 mil-
lion. More than 80 percent of the growth in
the uninsured in the past five years was
among those with incomes above 200 percent
of the poverty line.

All of this suggests that the lack of insur-
ance would have increased much faster had it
not been for the strong economy and the asso-
ciated increase in incomes, as well as lower
rates of premium increase. If these conditions
were to change, employer-sponsored coverage
could again decline overall and private non-
group coverage could fall even faster than it
has recently. Finally, if Medicaid coverage
rates continue to fall, Medicaid will no longer
be able to offset the decline in private cover-
age, as it did prior to 1993.

7. Although survey respondents could choose mul-
tiple types of health insurance on the survey, we
grouped and classified their responses according
to the following hierarchy: employer­own, in-
surance through a person's own employer-group
health plan; employer­other, primary coverage
through another's employer-group plan; Medic-
aid; other public, coverage from other non-
Medicaid government insurance programs, such
as military-related insurance and Medicare; other
private, coverage through a private insurance
plan but not as part of an employer-sponsored
benefit; and uninsured, the residual category for
those who did not report any of the other types
of coverage over the course of the year.
We examined the effect of using this hierar-
chial classification approach by comparing it
with changes in coverage using data on all types
of coverage reported by respondents. The results
do not change in significant ways, with one ex-
ception: There are no changes, as would be ex-
pected in employer coverage when no hierarchy
is used, because employer coverage is first in the
hierarchial sequence. Nor are there changes in
the number of uninsured, since this is a residual
category inboth approaches. However, we found
greater increases in Medicaid, other public, and
private nongroup coverage between 1989 and 1993
and greater reductions between 1994 and 1998.
8. These trends have led some to observe that the
Medicaid increases were the cause of the decline
in employer-sponsored coverage. Research on
this issue suggests that the crowding-out effect
was small and that the predominant effect was
to reduce the number of uninsured. L. Dubay,
"Expanding Public Insurance Coverage and
Crowd-Out: A Review of the Evidence," in Op-
tions for Expanding Health Insurance Coverage: What
DifferenceDo DifferentApproachesMake?, ed. J. Feder
and S. Burke (Washington: Henry J. Kaiser Fam-
ily Foundation, November 1999). Exhibit 1 sug-
gests this as well. The Medicaid expansions were
greater for children than for adults and increases
in the uninsured were less for children than for
adults, while declines in employer-sponsored
coverage were similar.
9. In 1998, 200 percent of the federal poverty level
was $16,660 for a family of four; 400 percent of
poverty was $33,320.
