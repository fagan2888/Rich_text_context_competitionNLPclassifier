Obesity. 2007;15:1199­1206.
Objective: To investigate the joint role of the 48-base pair
repeat polymorphism of the dopamine receptor 4 gene
(DRD4) and environmental factors in body mass variation
among an ethnically diverse sample of U.S. adolescents and
young adults.
Research Methods and Procedures: Approximately 2600
adolescent and young adults in the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) who provided
DNA measures and measures of height and weight were
included in the analysis. Mixed regression modeling was
used to investigate the effects of the 7R/7R and any5R
variants in the DRD4 gene simultaneously with the effects
of physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior (SB), and
family socioeconomic status (SES) on body mass variation.
European Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic
Americans were modeled separately.
Results and Discussion: Both the 7R/7R and any5R geno-
types of the DRD4 gene were associated with age- and
sex-specific BMI percentile score (BMI-P) based on the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center
for Health Statistics 2000 reference curves among African
Americans and only among African Americans (N  413)
20 years old or younger. Neither genetic variants are asso-
ciated with the BMI measure among white (N  1386) and
Hispanic-American (N  331) adolescents. The presence of
the 7R/7R genotype was associated with a reduction of 15.1
in BMI percentile (p  0.005), and the presence of any5R
was associated with an increase of 15.5 in BMI percentile
(p  0.003), after adjusting for PA, SB, and family SES.
Neither PA nor SB as measured in Add Health is impor-
tantly associated with BMI-P, suggesting a complex rela-
tionship between body mass and PA/SB among adolescents
and young adults. Family SES is negatively related to
BMI-P in the European-American sample.

Introduction
The goal of the present study was to investigate the joint
role of the 48-base pair repeat polymorphism of the dopa-
mine receptor 4 gene (DRD4)1 and environmental factors in
body mass among 2600 adolescents and young adults.
These participants were followed in 1995, 1996, and 2002
by the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health) (1). Guo and colleagues (2) reported an asso-
ciation between the 7R/7R variant of the DRD4 gene and
body mass in African-American and Hispanic-American
participants of Add Health. The present study builds on this
work to investigate the effects of the 7R/7R and any5R
variants in DRD4 simultaneously with the effects of phys-
ical activity (PA), sedentary behavior (SB), and family
socioeconomic status (SES) on body mass among the Add
Health participants.

food intake (3). Several neurotransmitters (dopamine,
-aminobutyric acid, norepinephrine, serotonin), peptides,
and amino acids are involved in the regulation of food
intake (4). Among them, dopamine attracts particular inter-
est because this neurotransmitter seems to regulate food
intake by modulating food reward by the mesolimbic cir-
cuitry of the brain (5,6).
DRD4, which maps 11p15.5 spanning 3.4 kb, is one of
the five types of dopamine receptors. Pharmacological ev-
idence implicates the DRD4 gene in obesity. Clozapine,
which binds with high affinity to DRD4 (7), can lead to
increased food consumption and subsequent weight gain,
both of which are associated with increased leptin produc-
tion (8). A functional VNTR (variable number of tandem
repeats) polymorphism has been identified in the third exon
in the DRD4 gene (9). The genetic variant is a 16-amino
acid repeat polymorphism, which is repeated 2 to 11 times,
with four repeats being by far the most common allele
(9,10). The in vitro studies suggest that the exon III DRD4
7-repeat allele (7R) has decreased affinity for dopamine and
transmits weaker intracellular signals in comparison with
other exon III alleles (11).
In adults, there is a consistent and inverse relationship
between PA and body mass (12­15), whereas the relation-
ship in youth is more complex (16). A positive association
has been shown between SB and obesity in youth and adults
(17­23).
SES and body mass/risk of obesity are found to be inversely
related in industrialized countries (24­26). Ball et al. (26)
showed that men living in housing of lower quality (e.g., living
in rental properties and/or with fewer bedrooms) and women
with lower employment indices (e.g., part-time workers and/or
in lower status occupations) had higher BMIs. Drewnowski
and Specter (27) suggested that the mechanism between SES
and obesity involves the shifting of limited economic re-
sources toward an energy-dense diet that provides the max-
imum calories for the cost. Energy-dense diets are likely to
contain added sugars and fats, and such diets are more
affordable than are diets based on lean meats, fish, fresh
vegetables, and fruit. The identification of social factors and
the mechanisms governing their relationship with obesity
risk is critical for the development of effective interven-
tions, to address social inequalities, and to halt the rapid
increase in obesity particularly in low SES groups.
Research Methods and Procedures
Subjects
The data source for our analysis is the sibling subsample
of 2600 participants from Add Health, a school-based
study of the health-related behaviors of adolescents in
grades 7 to 12 (12 to 18 years old) in 1995 in the United
States (1). The Add Health participants were interviewed
three times during a 7-year period in 1994 to 1995, 1995 to
1996, and 2001 to 2002. Our analysis used the sibling
sample of Add Health (monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins,
and full siblings) because DNA measures are currently only
available for this subset of the Add Health sample. Our
analysis sample consisted of 2284 individuals measured at
Waves I to III, of whom 64%, 20%, and 16% were Euro-
pean American, African American, and Hispanic American,
respectively (Table 1). Asians (n  190) were excluded
because no Asians were homozygous for 7R of DRD4.
Overweight and Obesity Measures
Add Health has collected three waves of overweight and
obesity data. The height and weight measures were self-
reported in Wave I and both self-reported and measured in
Waves II to III. Our analysis used Wave-I self-reported, and
Waves II to III measured weight and height. In a small
number of cases (1.8%), the missing measured body
weights and heights at Waves II and III are replaced by
self-reported weights and heights. Goodman et al. (28)
reported a strong correlation between measured and self-
reported height (0.94) and between measured and self-
reported weight (0.95) in Add Health.
We analyzed the age- and sex-specific BMI percentile
score (BMI-P), which is adjusted for the non-linear effects
of age and gender. The adjustment is accomplished by
transforming the raw BMI score into the age- and sex-
specific percentile score based on the observed growth
percentile curves for children, adolescents, and youth con-
structed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/
National Center for Health Statistics (29) for the United

States. The adjustment for age and sex is important for
adolescent body mass data because of the rapid growth that
occurs during childhood and adolescence. Our preliminary
analysis of the raw BMI taken at ages older than 20 revealed
highly significant age and sex effects, suggesting age and
sex continue to be important for BMI between 20 and 26.
Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-
constructed growth curves only cover the age range of 2 to
20, we confined our analysis to measures of BMI at ages 20
or younger.
DNA Preparation and Genotyping
At Wave III in 2002, DNA samples were collected from
a subset of the Add Health sample. Genomic DNA was
isolated from buccal cells using a modification of published
methods (30­33). The average yield of DNA was 58  1
g. The genotypic assay used for the DRD4 gene was a
modification of the method of Sander et al. (34). The primer
sequences (10) were: forward, 5-AGGACCCTCATGGC-
CTTG-3 (fluorescently labeled); and reverse, 5-GCGAC-
TACGTGGTCTACTCG-3. Of the nine alleles in the poly-
morphism, the 4 repeat (64.4%) is by far the most common
allele, followed by the 7 repeat (21.5%). Although the 5
repeat (allele 523) has an overall low frequency, the any5R
genotype prevalence varies considerably by ethnicity, with
6% for both African Americans and Hispanic Americans
and only 1% for European Americans. A series of 2 tests
each within a self-reported ethnic group (European Ameri-
can, African American, and Hispanic American) revealed
no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Measures of PA, SB, and Family SES
PA. The Add Health questionnaire included a standard
recall on PA behavior similar to other self-report question-
naires that have been used and validated in other large-scale
epidemiological studies (23,35­37). Information was elic-
ited on participation in moderate-to-vigorous PA [5 to 8
metabolic equivalents (METs), such as skating, cycling, and
other active sports] in the previous week. One MET is
defined as the energy expenditure associated with quiet
sitting. The PA questions were worded as such: "During the
past week, how many times did you," followed by activities,
such as walking, basketball, softball, etc., allowing calcula-
tion of frequency (bouts) of specified activities per week by
MET value.
The questionnaire at Wave III added four additional items
to reflect the wider variety of activity types common to
young adults. To make the scores across the three waves
comparable, we re-weighted the scores from Waves I and II
by a factor of 7/3, where 7 and 3 are, respectively, the
number of questions asked of each respondent at Wave III
and at Waves I and II. Similar re-weighting has been used
in Pate et al. (38­40).
SB. We constructed a score on SB using the self-reported
number of hours spent on watching television and video and
on playing video or computer games over the previous
week. Gordon-Larsen et al. (41) used a similar measure on
SB.
Family SES. SES was measured by the sum of the pa-
rental education and occupation scales (42), which were
reported separately for mother and father. Education ranged
in scale from 1 (8th grade or less or not graduated from high
school) to 5 (professional training beyond a 4-year college
or university). Occupation ranged from 0 (homemaker) to 5
(professional such as doctor, lawyer, scientist, teacher, li-
brarian, nurse/military, or security (graduated from a col-
lege or more). We used the higher value of father's and
mother's SES scale as family SES. If only one parent's SES
was available, the available SES was used as family SES.
Analytical Strategies
We adopted a two-step analytical strategy. First, we com-
pared, in a contingency table, the means of BMI-P across
DRD4 genotypes, ethnic groups, and Add Health Waves.
We also compared the means of BMI-P across level of PA
and level of SB. Second, we used the mixed regression
model (43,44) to estimate the association between measures
of body mass (BMI-P) and the DRD4 genotypes simulta-
neously with PA, SB, and family SES.
Our sample consists of twins and siblings and the re-
peated measures of the same individual over different waves
because these observations are not independent. The mixed
model has long been established in the statistical literature
for the analysis of data that are not independent. Several
major statistical packages [e.g., SAS (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC) and STATA (StataCorp LP., College Station,
TX)] include the mixed model as a standard procedure. The
following equation describes the structure of the mixed
model of BMI-P:
BMI-Pjits
 Xjt
 uj0s
 vji

(1)
where j, i, and t index sibling cluster or pair, individual, and
Add Health Waves, respectively; Xjt
and  are a vector of
observed variables including genotype, PA, physical inac-
tivity, and SES and a vector of their effects, respectively;
and s  m, d, or f indicates whether the sibling cluster or
pair are monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, or full biolog-
ical siblings. Thus, the model allows the random effect at
the sibling cluster level and the measure level to vary by
type of sibling cluster.
We used three strategies to address the potential impact
of population structure. First, we stratified our analysis by
self-reported ethnicity so that the cases and controls are
matched by ethnicity. Tang et al. (45) showed a near-perfect
correspondence between genetic clustering based on 326
microsatellite markers and the four self-reported ethnicity
categories (European Americans, African Americans, East
Asians, and Hispanic Americans).
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Guo et al.
OBESITY Vol. 15 No. 5 May 2007 1201
Our second strategy addressed this concern by taking
advantage of the detailed categories of self-reported race/
ethnicity in Add Health. In keeping with the new Census
policy, Add Health respondents were allowed to mark as
many ethnicity categories as they felt applied to them (1).
Approximately 7.5%, 3.5%, and 0% of African-American,
Hispanic-American, and European-American participants
marked more than one category, respectively. Of those who
marked more than one ethnic category, the large majority
(86%) marked two ethnic categories and 12% marked three
ethnic categories. We re-estimated our models after deleting
these multiethnic participants.
As a third strategy, we applied Allison et al.'s (46)
procedure to test for possible population stratification. Fol-
lowing the idea used in the development of sibship tests of
linkage and association (47­49), Allison et al. (46) reasoned
that the probabilities of genotypes of full siblings depended
entirely on parental genotypes and that controlling for the
effects of sibship would be equivalent to controlling for
parental genotypes. The procedure is a special case of the
mixed model (43,44).
Results
Descriptive Statistics and Contingency Table Analysis
Table 1 provides the mean or proportion of the variables
used in the analysis by ethnicity and categorizes individuals
into three genotypes: those homozygous for 7R (7R/7R),
those having at least one 5R (any5R), and the remainder of
the sample (4R-others, which are dominated by the 4R
allele). Data on DRD4*7R (2) are shown so that these
results can be evaluated with the results on any5R and
environmental factors. The categorization is consistent with
those used in the regression analysis (Table 4). The overall
genotype frequency for any5R is 3%, but the distribution
is uneven across the major ethnic groups, with 1%, 6%, and
5%, respectively, for European-American, African-Ameri-
can, and Hispanic-American samples.
Table 22 shows the mean BMI-P by DRD4 genotype,
ethnicity, and Add Health Wave. The mean BMI-P for the
7R/7R genotype is substantially and consistently lower than
those for the 7R/Other (not shown) or 4R/Others genotypes
across all ethnic groups and Add Health Waves. In contrast,
the mean BMI-P for any5R genotype is higher than 7R/7R
and 4R-Others. This result appears to hold only among
African Americans and, to a lesser degree, Hispanic-Amer-
icans.
Table 3 shows the means of BMI-P by PA and age group
and the means of BMI-P by physical inactivity and age
group. PA is not obviously related to BMI-P in adolescence
and young adulthood. SB is moderately and positively re-
lated to BMI-P.
Regression Analysis
In Table 4, statistically significant genotype effects were
found only among African Americans. Compared with the
reference category of the none-7R/7R and none-any5R ge-
notypes, the DRD4*7R/7R was associated with a large
negative (protective) effect of 15.08 percentile points
(p  0.005), and the DRD4*Any5R genotype was associ-

ated with a large positive effect of 15.48 percentile points
(p  0.003). These are fairly large effects considering the
mean BMI-P for African Americans is 62.8 (Table 1). These
effects were obtained after adjusting for the effects of age,
sex, ethnicity, PA, physical inactivity, and family SES.
Individuals heterozygous for 7R did not differ from those in
the reference category (data not shown). Contrary to the
expectation, PA in adolescence was positively related to
BMI-P among African Americans, but the result was only
marginally significant (p  0.07), and the magnitude of the
coefficient was small. Neither SB nor SES seems to be
related to BMI-P.
High levels of PA were associated with higher BMI-P in
the European-American (p  0.04) and Hispanic-American
(p  0.046) samples, although the coefficients were small.
Family SES was only associated with BMI-P among Euro-
pean-American participants, and the direction of the asso-
ciation was consistent with expectation.
To address population stratification, we carried out the
three strategies described earlier. First, all analyses in this
paper were stratified by self-reported ethnicity. As a second
strategy, we repeated our analyses after eliminating those
individuals who designated themselves as multiracial/eth-
nic. The results remained essentially unchanged. For exam-
ple, the remaining African-American sample yielded a pro-
tective effect of 14.3 (p  0.0088) for the 7R/7R genotype
as compared with 15.08 (p  0.0051) in Table 4 based on
the entire African-American sample. Lastly, we also imple-
mented Allison's (46) procedure in SAS, and our main
results were essentially unchanged (data not shown).
Discussion
In our study, both the 7R/7R and any5R genotypes of the
DRD4 gene were associated with body mass in African-
American participants 13 to 20 years old. The presence of
the 7R/7R genotype is associated with a reduction of 15
(p  0.005) in the BMI-P, and the presence of any5R was
associated with an increase of 15.5 (p  0.003) in BMI-P.
These associations were obtained after adjusting for PA,
SB, and family SES.

We treated the most common 4R variant as the baseline
variant (see our argument below) and performed three com-
parisons (2R, 3R, and 7R) against it. To address the issue of
multiple testing, we applied the Bonferroni procedure (50)
by using an adjusted level of significance /m, where m is
the number of tests. Thus, for three tests, our new level of
significance shrinks to /m  0.05/3  0.016. Both (7R/7R
and any5R) previously statistically significant results (Table
4) still hold under the Bonferroni correction. The Bonfer-
roni procedure tends to overcorrect multiple comparison
because the procedure assumes independence among the
multiple tests; the tests we performed are unlikely to be
independent.
Neither PA nor SB as measured in Add Health seems to
be importantly associated with BMI-P. PA is significantly
associated with BMI-P among adolescents in the European-
American, African-American, and Hispanic-American sam-
ples, but the effect size is quite moderate. For instance, with
a coefficient of 0.14, twice the mean number (7.76) of bouts
of PA over the last week only increases BMI-P (mean 
60.57) by 0.14  7.76  1.08 over those at the mean level
of PA for the European-American sample. The impact of SB
appears negligible. The absence of an important effect of
PA and SB suggests a complex relationship between body
mass and PA and/or SB. For example, a low level of PA and
a high level of PA may both be associated with high body
mass, although the composition of the body mass may
differ. Family SES seems to be more importantly and con-
sistently related to BMI-P in the European-American sam-
ple. Everything else being equal, doubling the mean SES
would reduce BMI-P by about 6. The moderate effects of
non-genetic/environmental factors contrast conspicuously
with the large genotype effects.
Only limited data are available on the role of DRD4
variants and body mass regulation (51­53; for brief review,
see 2). The hypothesis of reward deficiency syndrome (54)
is often invoked in studies examining the role of the dopa-
minergic system. The hypothesis in the context of obesity
research suggests that individuals with low intrinsic dopa-
mine activity in the brain reward pathways tend to compen-
sate by using various reinforcing behaviors, including in-
creased food consumption (55). Biochemical analyses of
DRD4 protein variants have demonstrated that the 7R pro-
tein has a blunted response for cyclic adenosine monophos-
phate reduction, requiring a 3-fold increase in dopamine
concentration for reductions comparable with the 4R protein
(11). Thus, the inhibitory neurons using the DRD4*7R
receptor would require increased dopamine for optimal
function (56).
Although functional analysis specific for DRD4*5R is
unavailable, our association results, if replicated, should be
valuable and may stimulate related biochemical functional
analysis. Grady, Ding, Wang, and colleagues (57­59) stud-
ied the origin of human DRD4 diversity by sequencing the
entire DRD4 locus from 103 individuals of African, Euro-
pean, Asian, North and South American, and Pacific Island
ancestry. They developed a general framework for testing
the differential effects of the various variants in the 48-base
pair VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) in DRD4.
Comparisons should be carried out, they suggested, between
the most ancient and by far the most common 4R allele and
the other rare alleles (57). The rare variants including our
7R/7R and any5R might have had a selective advantage in
certain environments. They also argued for continued ef-
forts to link DNA sequences with human outcomes even in
the absence of biochemical evidence linking the two be-
cause reliable linkage between biochemical differences and
behavioral differences is difficult. Also, for proteins like
DRD4 where most interacting proteins are undetected (60),
it is frequently unclear which biochemical parameter needs
to be investigated.
The absence of the association with any5R in the Euro-
pean-American sample may be because of its extremely low
genotype frequency (1%). The presence of strong genetic
associations only in the African-American sample suggests
that environmental or non-genetic factors may be at work. It
has been suggested that the greater prevalence of obesity
among African Americans may be explained by social class
and by cultural differences in the standards of beauty or in
the acceptance of greater range of body shapes and sizes
(61­64). European Americans, especial white females, tend
to be more concerned about body image (65,66), are more
likely to adopt weight control strategies (67), and have a
higher incidence of eating disorders such as anorexia and
bulimia nervosa (67­69) than African Americans.
Our future work will test the hypothesis that the genotype
effects among European Americans tend to be compensated
by obesity-related practices. The hypothesis can be tested by
analysis of gene-environment interaction between the geno-
types and measures of PA, SB, and family SES within the
European sample and analysis using obesity-related mea-
sures beyond those used in this analysis. Because of the low
genotype frequency of the 7R/7R and any5R genotypes, the
gene-environment analysis (1) can only be carried out in a
considerably larger sample than ours. Other future work will
comprehensively evaluate additional DRD4 polymorphisms
in this sample and in the entire Add Health sample of
