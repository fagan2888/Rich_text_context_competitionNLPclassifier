Background--The American Heart Association's 2020 Strategic Impact Goals target a 20% relative improvement in
overall cardiovascular health with the use of 4 health behavior (smoking, diet, physical activity, body mass) and 3 health
factor (plasma glucose, cholesterol, blood pressure) metrics. We sought to define current trends and forward projections
to 2020 in cardiovascular health.
Methods and Results--We included 35 059 cardiovascular disease­free adults (aged 20 years) from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey 1988­1994 and subsequent 2-year cycles during 1999­2008. We calculated population prevalence
of poor, intermediate, and ideal health behaviors and factors and also computed a composite, individual-level Cardiovascular Health
Score for all 7 metrics (poor0 points; intermediate1 point; ideal2 points; total range, 0­14 points). Prevalence of current and
former smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension declined, whereas prevalence of obesity and dysglycemia increased
through 2008. Physical activity levels and low diet quality scores changed minimally. Projections to 2020 suggest that obesity and
impaired fasting glucose/diabetes mellitus could increase to affect 43% and 77% of US men and 42% and 53% of US women,
respectively. Overall, population-level cardiovascular health is projected to improve by 6% overall by 2020 if current trends continue.
Individual-level Cardiovascular Health Score projections to 2020 (men7.4 [95% confidence interval, 5.7­9.1]; women8.8 [95%
confidence interval, 7.6­9.9]) fall well below the level needed to achieve a 20% improvement (men9.4; women10.1).
Conclusions--The American Heart Association 2020 target of improving cardiovascular health by 20% by 2020 will not
be reached if current trends continue. (Circulation. 2012;125:2595-2602.)

The American Heart Association (AHA) 2020 Strategic
Impact Goals target a 20% relative improvement in
overall cardiovascular health in all Americans with the use of
4 health behavior (smoking, diet, physical activity, body
weight) and 3 health factor (plasma glucose, cholesterol,
blood pressure) metrics.1 The 2020 goals were conceptualized
on the basis of 3 key concepts of health promotion and
disease prevention: (1) effectiveness of primordial preven-
tion; (2) life course nature of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
development and CVD risk factors; and (3) balance between
population- and individual-level prevention.1 A higher num-
ber of health behaviors and factors at ideal levels is associated
with substantially lower cardiovascular event rates in short-
and long-term follow-up.1,2 However, given the very low
prevalence of individuals with ideal cardiovascular health,3 a
20% relative improvement would have a small absolute effect
on the population. Concurrent shifts from poor to intermedi-
ate levels of health behaviors and factors will also be needed
to realize substantial improvements across the spectrum of
cardiovascular health. The 20% target was deemed aggressive
yet achievable by consensus.1

Clinical Perspective on p 2602
Current trends of these composite cardiovascular health metrics
are unclear. Decreases in smoking4 and exposure to secondhand
smoke5 have slowed. Nationally representative data continue to
suggest poor dietary quality for most of the population,6 but
increases in obesity prevalence may be slowing.7 Trends in physical
activity are mixed,4 but diabetes mellitus prevalence rates are
rising.4 Total cholesterol levels are decreasing, in part because of a
doubling in the use of lipid-lowering drugs.8 Despite population-
level increases in body weight, mean blood pressure and blood
pressure control are improving.9

We therefore sought to evaluate recent trends in composite
cardiovascular health metrics and to estimate future levels of
cardiovascular health behaviors and factors among adults in
the United States to determine whether the AHA 2020 goals
will be met if current trends continue.
Methods
We used data from noninstitutionalized, nonpregnant, nonlactating
adults aged 20 years in each age, sex, and race/ethnicity group as
appropriate who were free from CVD and participated in the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III,
1988­1994) and subsequent 2-year cycles (1999­2000, 2001­2002,
2003­2004, 2005­2006, 2007­2008). Methods of measurement of
each health behavior and health factor have been reported previously
and are described in the online-only Data Supplement.10 We defined
CVD as any self-reported history of myocardial infarction, angina,
stroke, or heart failure. We calculated prevalence estimates from
1988 to 2008 of ideal, intermediate, and poor levels of the 7
cardiovascular health behaviors and health factors, as defined by the
AHA 2020 Impact Goals (Table 1).1
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were performed with the use of SAS version 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) with the complex sampling design taken into
account. We used the standard 2000 US population to adjust the data
for age using 3 age strata (20­39, 40­59, and 60 years). To
estimate time trends from 1988 to 2008 and average annual change
in cardiovascular health factors and behaviors, we performed
weighted linear regression using estimated mean values or percent-
ages as dependent variables and survey time as independent vari-
ables. We fitted weighted linear regression models with prevalence
as the dependent variables and survey time as independent variables.
The  coefficients indicate the average annual change in the
prevalence. On the basis of the findings, we projected the future
situation of year 2020 assuming that trends would continue to
change at a similar rate. We calculated prediction intervals on the
basis of SE of the predicted prevalence estimates. Reciprocals of
variances were used as weights. We projected estimates to 2020 by
assuming that trends would continue in a manner similar to those
observed over the past 2 decades in a linear fashion. Because the
methodology used to measure diet and physical activity had changed
from NHANES III to the 1999­2008 cycles, we excluded NHANES
III dietary and physical activity data and only included 1999­2008
data. Likewise, because the methodology used to measure physical
activity changed between the 2005­2006 and 2007­2008 cycles, we
excluded 2007­2008 cycle physical activity data. We performed a
sensitivity analysis by including individuals with CVD, and the
overall prevalence trends and 2020 projections were not substan-
tively different (3% absolute difference in all 2020 projections
including individuals with prevalent CVD).
We projected the situation for 2020 by assuming that trends would
continue to change at a similar rate. We considered alternative statistical
methods such as linear models with a quadratic term for time to assess
nonlinear trends, but the results differed little from standard linear models
with the sole exception of blood pressure trends in women. The majority of
our final estimated models had coefficients of determination (R2) values of
0.80 and better. Results from log-linear and logit models were nearly
identical to the results from linear models. In addition, the projected 2020
estimates for blood pressure in women with a model with a quadratic term
were substantially lower than a realistic value. Thus, we chose to use the
linear models for simplicity. Estimates with a coefficient of variation 30%
were considered unreliable.11 Data are presented as mean and 95%
confidence interval (CI). A P value 0.05 defined statistical significance.
We compared these estimates based on current trends with a 20%
improvement in cardiovascular health metrics from 2006 to 2020
because the AHA used 2006 as a reference point. A 20% improve-
ment in cardiovascular health was defined as the average of a 20%
relative decrease in the prevalence of poor cardiovascular health
metrics and a 20% relative increase in the prevalence of ideal
cardiovascular health across the 7 metrics. This method minimizes
the likelihood of demonstrating an improvement in cardiovascular
health that is driven solely by a reduction in poor health, which could
be due to higher death rates in that group. Categories of ideal,
intermediate, and poor levels of each metric are exclusive from each
other. Thus, the prevalence estimates across different categories of
each item (poor smoking, intermediate smoking, and ideal smoking,

for example) sum to 100% by definition. For projections to 2020, we
created estimates by first accounting for changes in ideal and poor
levels of each metric and created estimates for intermediate levels on
the basis of the remaining prevalence.
To capture individual-level changes in cardiovascular health
factors and behaviors, we created a composite, individual-level
Cardiovascular Health Score based on the individual-level composite
of all 7 cardiovascular health behaviors and health factors (poor0
points; intermediate1 point; ideal2 points; total scale: 0­14
points). This score is not a risk prediction tool but helps to assess
individual-level trends amid population-level trends in cardiovascu-
lar health. We assessed changes in the score from 1999 to 2006 and
performed forward projections to 2020 in a similar manner. We did
not calculate Cardiovascular Health Scores for NHANES III and for
the 2007­2008 cycle because of methodological differences in diet
and physical activity data collection from 1999 to 2006.
Results
Among 79 932 participants who attended interviews and
examination measurements from 1988 to 2008, we analyzed
data from up to 35 059 participants. Reasons for exclusion
were as follows: age 20 years (n38 666; 48.4%), women
pregnant or lactating (n1628; 2.0%), and prior CVD,
defined as prior myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, or heart
failure (n4579; 5.7%) (Figure I in the online-only Data
Supplement). Participants' mean age was 44.4 years, and
51% were women.
Prevalence estimates for adults categorized as poor, inter-
mediate, and ideal for cardiovascular health components in
1988­1994 and 2007­2008 are displayed by sex in Tables 2
and 3. In addition,  coefficients and SEs from weighted
linear regression models, representing trends for each metric
by including data from all NHANES samples, and coeffi-
cients of determination (R2) are displayed.
Prevalence of current smoking, physical activity (1999­2006
only), high cholesterol, and high blood pressure (ie, poor levels
of these metrics) all decreased from 1988 to 2008, although

trends in physical activity and in high blood pressure in women
were not statistically significant, whereas a corresponding in-
crease in ideal smoking status (never smoker or quit 12
months) was observed. However, there was not a significant
increase in the prevalence of individuals with ideal levels of
physical activity, cholesterol, or blood pressure. Conversely,
obesity and dysglycemia increased substantially in both sexes
from 1988 to 2008. Furthermore, there was a minimal increase
in healthy diet score in men and no change in women during the
period of observation (1999­2008).
Projected prevalence trends to 2020 (95% CIs) for ideal,
intermediate, and poor cardiovascular health metrics, with the
assumption that current trends continue, are also presented in
Tables 2 and 3. Current smoking decreased significantly from
1998 to 2008 in both men and women, with projected
prevalence in 2020 reaching 23% in men and 16% in women.
Prevalence of former smokers who had quit 12 months ago
(intermediate cardiovascular health) increased in both groups
as well and is projected to be 4.5% and 4.3% in men and
women, respectively, in 2020. Among current smokers, the
mean number of cigarettes per day was lower in both men and
women and in all age groups (Figure II in the online-only
Data Supplement).
The prevalence of ideal healthy diet score4 or 5 increased
minimally from 0.3% to 0.6% in men (P0.04) and from 0.9% to
1.4% in women (P0.02) between 1999 and 2008. The projected
prevalence of ideal healthy diet score will reach only 1.2% in men
and 1.9% in women by 2020. The mean healthy diet score was
minimally increased between 1999 and 2008 in men (from 0.78 to
0.84 healthy diet components; P0.04) and in women (from 1.04
to 1.10; P0.33). The healthy diet scores were slightly higher for
adults aged 60 years in both men and women from 2000 to 2006,
but these differences were small and are projected to narrow further
by 2020 (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement).

Physical inactivity prevalence declined nonsignificantly
from 1999 to 2006 in both men (from 37% to 30%; P0.40)
and women (from 42% to 32%; P0.87). Corresponding
increases in the prevalence of intermediate and ideal physical
activity levels were also not statistically significant in either
sex. Projections to 2020 appear unreliable given fewer time
periods and the wide variance of this measure. The median
number of minutes of activity per week was 150 minutes in
all age and sex groups from 2000 to 2006 (Figure IV in the
online-only Data Supplement).
Mean body mass index and obesity rates increased sub-
stantially from 20% in NHANES III to 32% by 2007­2008 in
men and are projected to reach 43% by 2020 if current trends
continue. Similar trends were observed in women, in whom
2020 prevalence projections of obesity reach 42%. There was
a corresponding rise in mean body mass index and decrease
in the prevalence of ideal body mass index 25 kg/m2
(Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement).
Trends in dysglycemia prevalence rates were similar.
Diabetes mellitus prevalence and impaired fasting glucose
increased in both men and women. The 2020 projected
prevalence of diabetes mellitus is 14% in men and 8% in
women, and 50% of women and 25% of men will have
ideal fasting plasma glucose levels (100 mg/dL). Among
individuals with diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin A1c
values are
projected to decrease (from 7.5% to 7.2% from 2008 to 2020)
in men but remain stable in women (Figure VI in the
online-only Data Supplement). Among individuals without
diabetes mellitus, the mean fasting plasma glucose increased
to 104 mg/dL in men and 99 mg/dL in women in 2008, with
2020 projections reaching 108 mg/dL and 101 mg/dL, respec-
tively, if current trends continue (Figure VII in the online-
only Data Supplement).
The mean total cholesterol fell from 204 to 196 mg/dL in
men and 206 to 199 mg/dL in women from 1998 to 2008. By
2020, mean total cholesterol is projected to decrease in both
men (to 191 mg/dL) and women (to 194 mg/dL) (Figure VIII
in the online-only Data Supplement). The corresponding
prevalence of high cholesterol (240 mg/dL) decreased from
19% to 14% in men (P0.01) and from 21% to 15% in
women (P0.01) from 1988 to 2008. However, the preva-
lence of individuals with intermediate cholesterol increased
significantly. This group includes individuals with untreated
levels of 200 to 239 mg/dL and those with total cholesterol
200 mg/dL on medical therapy (Figures IX and X in the
online-only Data Supplement).
The prevalence of high blood pressure decreased from 21%
to 16% in men (P0.01) and from 17% to 13% in women
(P0.22), with a significant increase in the prevalence of
intermediate levels of untreated blood pressure (120­
139 mm Hg systolic or 80­89 mm Hg diastolic) or blood
pressure treated to 140/90 mm Hg in women but not men.
Mean systolic blood pressure is projected to be 119 mm Hg in
men and women by 2020. Older adults (60 years) had
declines in mean systolic blood pressure, whereas middle-
aged adults (40­59 years) and younger adults (20­39 years)
did not (Figure XI in the online-only Data Supplement).
Decreases in mean systolic blood pressure over time were
most pronounced among groups using blood pressure-
lowering agents, in whom systolic blood pressure was lower
across all ages during all cycles (Figures XII and XIII in the
online-only Data Supplement).
Projections in Cardiovascular Health: Will a 20%
Improvement Be Achieved by 2020?
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of ideal (green), intermediate
(yellow), and poor (red) cardiovascular health metrics in 2006
(AHA 2020 Impact Goals baseline year) and 2020 projections
with the assumption that current trends continue. Addition-
ally, Figure 1 provides 2020 targets for each cardiovascular
health metric, with the assumption of a 20% relative increase
in ideal cardiovascular health prevalence metrics and a 20%
relative decrease in poor cardiovascular health prevalence
metrics for men and women.
Projected decreases in the prevalence of poor cardiovascu-
lar health will meet the 20% improvement if current trends
continue for smoking, physical activity, blood pressure, and
cholesterol. However, fewer and more modest increases in
the prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health metrics are
projected for smoking, diet, and physical activity. Overall, we
estimate a 6.04% relative improvement in the prevalence of
overall cardiovascular health on the basis of current trends
using the methods outlined by the AHA. This would be well
short of the AHA target.
Cardiovascular Health Score
Figure 2 shows the distributions of the individual-based Cardio-
vascular Health Score over 5 NHANES cycles from 1999 to
2006. The highest overall mean score occurred during the
2005­2006 cycle (yellow curves). Furthermore, from 1999 to
2006, mean Cardiovascular Health Scores did not change sig-
nificantly for men (from 7.9 to 7.8 points; P0.48) or women
(from 8.2 to 8.4 points; P0.46). If these current trends continue
to 2020, the mean scores are projected to be 7.4 (95% CI,
5.7­9.1) for men and 8.8 (95% CI, 7.6­9.9) for women. These
estimates are substantially lower than the target scores necessary
to achieve a 20% relative improvement in individual-level
cardiovascular health (9.4 for men; 10.1 for women).
Discussion
Summary of Results
From 1988 to 2008, significant declines in the prevalence of
smoking, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure (in men)
have been offset by substantial increases in the prevalence of
obesity and dysglycemia. Healthy diet scores have changed
minimally, and physical inactivity has trended lower, albeit
not significantly. The declines in high cholesterol and high
blood pressure are not matched with a concomitant increase
in the prevalence of ideal cholesterol and blood pressure
levels, suggesting that individuals are moving toward inter-
mediate levels of each health factor, a stratum that includes
individuals treated to cholesterol and/or blood pressure target.
Worrying increases in body mass index and dysglycemia
are matched by a concomitant decrease in the prevalence of
normal-weight and euglycemic adults, consistently suggest-
ing adverse population-level shifts in each metric. Our
projections may overestimate the future prevalence of im-
paired fasting glucose (intermediate cardiovascular health)

because some individuals will likely develop diabetes mellitus
by crossing the 126 mg/dL fasting plasma glucose threshold and
will not contribute to these projected mean values.
Implications
Our estimated 6% relative improvement in cardiovascular health
from 2006 to 2020 is far short of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals'
target of improving cardiovascular health by 20%. Furthermore,
we project no changes in the mean individual Cardiovascular
Health Score for both men and women. In addition to worsening
cardiovascular health metrics, current trends will likely lead to
stagnating age-adjusted fatal and nonfatal CVD event rates in the
context of rising healthcare costs on the basis of unfavorable
coronary heart disease mortality trends among Americans aged
35 to 54 years.12 The AHA has recently estimated that between
2010 and 2030, direct costs for CVD (including hypertension,
coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and all other CVD)
will increase from $273 billion to $818 billion, and indirect costs
will rise from $172 billion to $276 billion, unless substantial
changes to prevent and control CVD are adopted.13
The optimal combination of primordial,14 primary, and second-
ary prevention approaches--realized through a mixture of medical
and public health/policy interventions--will be critical for any
high-functioning health system to reduce the prevalence of poor
cardiovascular health metrics. The goals of this approach are to (1)
provide high-quality, equitable management of individuals with risk
factors and disease and (2) shift individuals from intermediate to
ideal levels or, optimally, to maintain ideal health cardiovascular
metrics throughout the lifespan. This has been shown to lead to
greater longevity and health,15 compression of morbidity,16 dramat-
ically low lifetime risks for CVD (which account for competing
risks),17 and remarkably lower healthcare utilization and costs
(annual, lifetime, and last year of life).18 Given these compelling
findings, the improvement in cardiovascular health through quanti-
fiable metrics has received increasing attention, including being part
of Healthy People 2020 as a named objective.19
Potential Targets for Intervention
These results reinforce the central importance of comprehen-
sive tobacco control policies as well as the prevention and
management of obesity through diet, exercise, and judicious
use of therapies for weight loss to improve cardiovascular
health in adults. Although declines in tobacco consumption are
encouraging, tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable
death and disability, including a substantial burden of non-CVD
such as lung cancer and chronic lung disease. The downstream
impact of obesity on other cardiovascular health metrics such as
dysglycemia, blood pressure, and possibly cholesterol suggests

intermediate (yellow), and poor (red) car-
diovascular health metrics in 2006 (AHA

each cardiovascular health metric are

ative decrease in poor cardiovascular
health prevalence metrics for men and

that reversal of body weight trends will have substantial benefits
across the spectrum of cardiovascular health.
The World Health Organization has also prioritized to-
bacco control and healthier diet policies, suggesting several
population-level "best buy" policy options for noncommuni-
cable, chronic disease prevention that are relevant to cardio-
vascular health in the United States and the AHA's 2020
Impact Goals. These include the following: (1) public smok-
ing bans, (2) tobacco advertising restrictions, (3) increased
tobacco excise taxes (especially relevant at the state level
given the wide variation across the United States20), (4)
reduced salt in the food supply, (5) replacement of trans fats
with polyunsaturated fats, and (6) mass media campaigns to
promote healthy diets and physical activity.21 In concert with
policy changes, more rigorous improvements in individual
lifestyle behaviors and factors and medical treatment and
control (including combination therapy for high-risk individ-
uals) are needed to help shift individuals from poor to
intermediate to ideal cardiovascular health.19
Strengths/Limitations
The strengths of our results include its large, nationally
representative sample size and 20-year measurement period.
However, our study has limitations. First, measures of diet
and physical activity are prone to sampling variability, as
noted by the wide CIs for these estimates, and misclassifica-
tion due to self-reporting. In addition, we relied on fewer
NHANES cycles for trend tests and 2020 projections for diet
and physical activity. Our estimates for diet and physical
activity may be unstable and should be interpreted cautiously.
Second, future trends may not be linear, as we have assumed.
For example, recent obesity increases may be plateauing;
conversely, recent cholesterol and blood pressure declines
may also be plateauing, which may contribute to the flatten-
ing coronary heart disease mortality rates in young men and
women in the United States, United Kingdom, and else-
where.12,22 Finally, we created a simple composite Cardio-
vascular Health Score to examine individual-level cardiovas-
cular health. This score weighs the presence of all
intermediate or poor levels of the 7 metrics equally. Prior
studies indicate that some adverse health factors, such as
current smoking or diabetes mellitus, may be associated with
greater relative risks for cardiovascular events than other
factors. However, the present score is not intended as a
measure to estimate risk; rather, it serves as a means for
monitoring the distribution (poor, intermediate, or ideal) of
all 7 metrics at the individual level across the population.
Furthermore, Folsom et al2 recently demonstrated that there
were roughly equal stepwise decreases in hazards for cardio-
vascular events for each additional single health behavior or
health factor present at ideal levels.
Conclusions
If current trends continue, overall cardiovascular health is
projected to improve by only 6% from 2006 to 2020, far
below the AHA 2020 Strategic Impact Goals target of 20%.
This projection reflects modest, further declines in tobacco
consumption, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure,
offset by increases in obesity and dysglycemia. Continued
individual-level primary and secondary preventive measures
should be complemented by an increased national commit-
ment to promote primordial prevention. The potential reduc-
tions in CVD burden if the AHA 2020 Strategic Impact Goals
target of 20% improvement in overall cardiovascular health
were achieved could be substantial, rapid, and associated with
substantial cost savings.23­26

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
The American Heart Association's Strategic Planning Task Force set forth the goal of improving the cardiovascular health of all
Americans by 20% by 2020. To assess progress toward this goal, 7 health metrics were defined: smoking, diet, physical activity,
body weight, blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol. In this investigation, we asked, "If current trends in these metrics
continue, will this goal be reached?" We evaluated past trends by using data from the 1998­2008 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) examination cycles and created best-fit linear regression models and linear forward projections
to 2020. We also created an individual-level Cardiovascular Health Score to evaluate individual-level changes in cardiovascular
health amid larger population trends. Our results suggest that if current trends continue, changes in the individual-level
Cardiovascular Health Score will be minimal and that the overall cardiovascular health of the US population will improve by only
6% by 2020; this progress is far short of the American Heart Association's target of 20% improvement. This projection reflects
modest further declines in tobacco use and improved control of high cholesterol and high blood pressure that are offset by
increases in obesity and dysglycemia prevalence. In conclusion, continued individual-level primary and secondary preventive
measures should be complemented by an increased national commitment to policies promoting prevention of the development
of abnormal risk factor levels from childhood onward. If the American Heart Association target of 20% improvement in overall
cardiovascular health were achieved, the potential reductions in cardiovascular disease burden could be substantial, rapid, and
associated with substantial cost savings.

Supplemental Methods
NHANES Methods of Measurement for Health Behaviors and Factors
Details regarding NHANES survey questionnaires, examination components and laboratory components
are available at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.
Health Behaviors
Participants were asked about smoking habits through the following questions, "Do you now smoke
cigarettes?" and "How long has it been since you quit smoking cigarettes?" Former smokers were divided into quit
<12 months (intermediate CV health) and quit >12 months (ideal CV health).
Participants were surveyed about their dietary habits from 1999-2008 through a combination of food frequency
questionnaire and 24-hour dietary recall performed three to seven days following mobile examination center (MEC)
examination. Interviewees were provided a set of measuring guides to assist their recall. Leisure-time physical
activity was queried from 1999-2006 using the following questions, "Over the past 30 days, what moderate activity
or activities did you do?" and "Over the past 30 days, how often did you perform (that activity)?" Similar questions
were asked regarding vigorous activities. Activities were coded to estimate metabolic equivalents (METs) for
moderate and vigorous activities.
Health Factors
Height and weight were measured in a MEC examination with standardized equipment and techniques.
Body mass index was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Diabetes was defined
by fasting blood glucose > 126 mg/dl or affirmative response to one or more of the following questions: "Have you
ever been told by a doctor that you have diabetes? Are you now taking insulin? Are you now taking diabetes pills
to lower your blood sugar?" Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured in participants
fasting >8 hours. LDL cholesterol was measured using the Friedewald equation if triglycerides were <400 mg/dl
(LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol ­ HDL cholesterol ­ triglycerides/5). Medical treatment of high cholesterol was
queried by asking, "To lower your blood cholesterol, have you ever been told by a doctor or other health
professional to take prescribed medicine?" followed by "Are you now following this advice to take prescribed
medicine?" Blood pressure was measured by trained personnel using a mercury sphygmomanometer and an
inflatable cuff at the level of the heart, after the participant rested for 5 minutes in a seated position with both feet on
the floor. Three blood pressure measurements were recorded and the mean of the last two recordings was used; if
fewer than three measurements were performed, the second (if two) or first (if one) recording was used. Medical
treatment of elevated blood pressure was queried by asking, "Because of your hypertension/high blood pressure,
have you ever been told to take a prescribed medicine?" followed by, "Are you now taking a prescribed medicine?"
