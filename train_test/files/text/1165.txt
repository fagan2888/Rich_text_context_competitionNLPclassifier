Context: Existing research on the neurobehavioral con-
sequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has not
adequately accounted for genetic and environmental con-
founds.
Objective: To examine the association between PAE and
offspring externalizing problems in a large representa-
tive sample of families in the United States using mea-
sured covariates and a quasi-experimental design to ac-
count for unmeasured genetic and environmental
confounds.
Design: This study combines information from the Na-
tional Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Children of
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The analy-
ses statistically controlled for measured characteristics
of the mothers and families and exposure to other pre-
natal psychoactive substances. In the primary analyses,
siblings differentially exposed to prenatal alcohol were
compared.
Setting and Participants: Women were recruited from
the community using a stratified and clustered probabil-
ity sample and were followed longitudinally. The sample
included 8621 offspring of 4912 mothers.
Main Outcome Measures: Maternal report of con-
duct problems (CPs) and attention/impulsivity prob-
lems (AIPs) during childhood (ages 4-11 years) using stan-
dardized assessments related to psychiatric diagnoses.
Results: There was an association between PAE and off-
spring CPs that was independent of confounded genetic
and fixed environmental effects and the measured co-
variates. The CPs in children of mothers who drank daily
during pregnancy were 0.35 SD greater than those in chil-
dren whose mothers never drank during pregnancy. Al-
though AIPs were associated with PAE when compar-
ing unrelated offspring, children whose mothers drank
more frequently during pregnancy did not have more AIPs
than siblings who were less exposed to alcohol in utero.
Additional subsample analyses suggested that maternal
polysubstance use during pregnancy may account for the
associations between PAE and AIPs.
Conclusion: These results are consistent with PAE ex-
erting an environmentally mediated causal effect on child-
hood CPs, but the relation between PAE and AIPs is more
likely to be caused by other factors correlated with ma-
ternal drinking during pregnancy.

PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPO-
sure (PAE) has been associ-
ated with offspring external-
izing problems, such as
conduct problems (CPs),1
criminality,2 attention/impulsivity prob-
lems (AIPs),3,4 and alcohol disorders.5-8 A
recent review of the literature9 and a meta-
analysis,10 however, have raised ques-
tions about the strength of some of the as-
sociations. Given the current state of
research on prenatal drug exposure, Hu-
izink and Mulder11 recently highlighted
important challenges for the research com-
munity. In particular, they noted the need
to document deleterious outcomes asso-
ciated with moderate levels of alcohol ex-
posure, explore the adjustment of off-
spring across time, and delineate the effects
of exposure to multiple drugs. Research
also needs to adequately control for co-
variates that may confound the effects of
PAE, such as family processes (eg, prob-
lematic parenting or family conflict) and
parental characteristics, especially mater-
nal substance use.1,12 Researchers also need
to account for genetic liabilities that are
shared by parents and offspring.13,14 A
woman's genetic risk of substance use
could be passed down to her children and
subsequently affect their behavior.15 Re-
search on the consequences of PAE, there-
fore, needs studies with large samples, with
sufficient statistical power to detect small
effects, using analytical methods and de-
signs that can account for potential con-

founds, including factors that are not measured. Such
studies could complement smaller, more intensive stud-
ies6,7,13 and provide the opportunity to find convergent
evidence from multiple research approaches.16
Because of the myriad of variables associated with pre-
natal substance exposure, quasi-experimental designs are
useful because they can test alternative causal infer-
ences.16 Quasi-experimental designs rely on natural ex-
periments that can pull apart processes that are typi-
cally confounded. Genetically informed approaches, one
class of quasi-experimental designs, are important be-
cause they can separate the co-occurring genetic and en-
vironmental processes. The use of quasi-experimental de-
signs, therefore, can help the study of putative
environments, such as PAE, move from merely identi-
fying risk factors to highlighting the underlying causal
mechanisms of externalizing problems.17
Recently, a variety of quasi-experimental and geneti-
cally informed studies related to prenatal substance ex-
posure have been reported. Two studies used the children-
of-twins design18-20 to explore smoking during pregnancy
(SDP), finding an independent association between SDP
and birth weight21 and attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order (ADHD)14 when shared genetic and environmen-
tal liability were taken into account. Sibling comparison
studies have also been used to study SDP. The approach
contrasts children exposed to more prenatal nicotine to
their siblings exposed to less, a design that controls for
characteristics of the mothers, including genetic risk
associated with SDP. The results suggest that indepen-
dent associations between SDP and psychosocial adjust-
ment are either greatly reduced or absent.22,23 Only 1 quasi-
experimental study, however, has been conducted on the
consequences of PAE. Knopik et al14 found that PAE was
not independently associated with offspring ADHD in a
children-of-twins study.
Given the somewhat contradictory findings of the as-
sociation between PAE and offspring attention prob-
lems9 and the results of the 1 genetically informed study,14
a quasi-experimental study of the consequences of PAE
on offspring externalizing problems is of critical impor-
tance. Inferences about PAE affect public health cam-
paigns and prevention efforts24 in addition to informing
theories about the etiology of CPs.17 The need for more
rigorous studies of PAE is further supported by recent
prevalence estimates that indicate that alcohol use dur-
ing pregnancy is still relatively common.25
The overall aim of the present article is to explore
whether PAE is related to offspring externalizing behav-
iors and, if so, whether the exposure is consistent with a
causal association. The present study has 6 goals. First,
these analyses explore the relation between PAE and char-
acteristics of the mothers and families. Second, the study
documents the statistical relation between PAE and child
externalizing problems. Third, the analyses explore
whether measured covariates account for associations with
PAE. Fourth, the analyses compare siblings and cousins
differentially exposed to prenatal alcohol to account for
unmeasured confounds, including genetic and environ-
mental factors. If PAE causes externalizing problems, the
association will be found at all levels, especially within
mothers (ie, siblings exposed to higher levels of prena-
tal alcohol would have more problems than their sib-
lings exposed to lower levels).26 The comparison of sib-
lings explicitly controls for maternal genetic confounds
because PAE is not correlated with genetic risk within
mothers. Fifth, the analyses investigate whether the re-
lation was robust to the quasi-experimental approach and
statistical controls. Finally, an analysis of a subsample
of the children that includes measures of prenatal expo-
sure to marijuana and cocaine further explores mater-
nal polysubstance use. Ultimately, an environmentally
mediated causal effect of PAE on childhood externaliz-
ing behaviors--a causal inference--would be sup-
ported if the relation remained robust to the measured
covariates and quasi-experimental methods because these
approaches account for many of the alternative expla-
nations for the association between PAE and externaliz-
ing problems. This research was approved by the insti-
tutional review board at Indiana University.
METHODS
SAMPLE
Mother Generation Sample
The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) is a lon-
gitudinal study of adolescents and young adults funded by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. The initial NLSY79 sample included a
nationally representative sample of 6111 youths and an overs-
ample of 3652 African American and Hispanic youth. The initial
sampleofyouthusedastratifiedandclusteredprobabilitysample,
which included all siblings in each household in the age range.
The present study was conducted using 4912 females from the
combined sample who had a child who was at least 4 years old
by the 2004 survey. The initial NLSY79 assessment had a re-
sponse rate of 90%. Participants were assessed annually between
1979 and 1994 and biennially since then. Retention rates were
90% or better during the first 16 waves of data collection. Prob-

giveninTable 1.Thesamplewasraciallydiverse;basedonmoth-
ers' self-reports, 17.1% were Hispanic, 25.9% were African Ameri-
can, and 57.1% were non-Hispanic white.
Offspring Generation Sample
Starting in 1986, biennial assessments of the offspring of the
women in the NLSY79 sample were performed, referred to as
the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(CNLSY) sample.28 The initial response rate was 95%, with sub-
sequent assessments averaging 90%. Although 3 types of in-
terviews are available on the offspring, the present project uses
maternal report of the children's characteristics assessed be-
tween ages 4 and 11 years (n=8621 children with reports of
PAE). Studies using the offspring of the NLSY79 mothers have
been plagued by selection bias because until all childbearing
of the mothers is complete, offspring available for assessment
were necessarily born to the younger mothers. Given that the
overwhelming majority of the childbearing was completed by
the 2004 survey and we use assessments of young children, the
selection bias for the present analyses is relatively small (B.M.D.,
J. A. Goodnight, MA, C.A.V.H., I.D.W., J.L.R., P.J.R., and B.B.L.,

MEASURES
Prenatal Exposure to Psychoactive Substances
Beginning in 1983, the NLSY79 females reported their prena-
tal substance use, including alcohol consumption and ciga-
rette use, during each of their pregnancies. Most of the assess-
ments of prenatal substance use reports were completed when
the children were young, mostly within 2 years of birth.22
Table 2 includes the response categories for alcohol and con-
versions to days per week for the sample of offspring with in-
formation on externalizing problems. A previous article22 ana-
lyzed the consequences of SDP. Owing to the small number of
pregnancies during which the mothers reported drinking ev-
ery day, the last 2 categories were collapsed. There are missing
data for the prenatal substance use section. Most of the miss-
ing PAE data (92%) were due to an incorrect skip in the as-
sessment protocol. Sensitivity analyses (replacing the missing
values with zeros, the mean PAE for the mothers, or estimates
based on multiple imputation) revealed that the missing val-
ues for PAE did not alter the results presented herein, which
are based only on offspring with reports of PAE.
The maternal assessment started to measure marijuana and
cocaine use during pregnancy in the 1986 assessment. There-
fore, the variables were available only for 3977 offspring with
data on externalizing behaviors. Because of the low preva-
lence, exposure was coded as exposed or not for each drug. In
the subsample, 1.6% of children were exposed to prenatal mari-
juana and 0.6% to cocaine.
Maternal and Familial Characteristics
Available characteristics of the mothers and families that could
confound the effects of PAE were included in the analyses.
Table 1 provides the distribution of the items. When the even-
tual mothers of the CNLSY sample were aged 15 to 22 years
they were asked about their participation in 12 delinquent be-
haviors using the Self-Reported Delinquency Interview,29 a re-
liable and valid measure used in contemporary delinquency re-
search.30-32 Symptom counts were regressed on the mother's age
at which she completed the survey and were converted to a z
score for ease of interpretability. Maternal age at the birth of
her first child was also obtained, a variable that predicts off-
spring delinquency in the CNLSY (B.M.D., J. A. Goodnight, MA,
C.A.V.H., I.D.W., J.L.R., P.J.R., and B.B.L., unpublished data,
August 2007).33 Net family income was reported for mothers
at age 30 years in 1986 inflation-adjusted dollars, a measure
that includes income from all adults in the household at that
time. Total number of years of schooling was also assessed for
each mother. A composite score of the Armed Services Voca-
tional Aptitude Battery was used as a measure of the mother's
intellectual ability, which was converted to a z score. The 1994
assessment included an extensive assessment of the mother's
alcohol use and alcohol problems (during her lifetime and not
limited to her pregnancies). These questions assessed alcohol
frequency (days per month), quantity (drinks per day), and the
number of binge episodes in the past month, and 25 items as-
sessed lifetime symptoms of alcohol abuse and dependence. A
total of 32% of the women also reported having children by more
than 1 man.
Offspring Childhood Externalizing Problems
Mothers rated their 4- to 11-year-old children on the Behavior
Problem Index at each wave of assessment. The Behavior Prob-
lem Index included 13 items from the Child Behavior Check-
list34 that had the strongest associations with Child Behavior
Checklist factor scores.35 Mothers rated each child using a 3-point
scale. Standard diagnostic approaches36 and previous factor
analyses22 revealed that the items load on 3 factors: CPs, op-
positional problems, and AIPs. The association between PAE
and CPs and AIPs is explored herein. Trajectory analyses on
the CNLSY sample36 indicated that the average number of CPs
during ages 4 to 11 years was stable and represents a good mea-
sure of severity of externalizing problems reported by adoles-
cents. Therefore, mean CP scores across ages 4 to 11 years were
calculated by taking the mean of z scores for CPs at each as-
sessed year of age, standardized within each age. The CPs at
each age were highly correlated with the mean across ages 4 to
11 years (r=0.74-0.80). The items assessing CPs used in the
CNLSY also overlap substantially with those used in previous
population-based longitudinal studies.32,37 The mean of z scores
for AIPs was also stable and exhibited good external validity.
The AIP scores at each age were highly correlated with the mean
score across ages 4 to 11 years (r0.80 for each). Mean AIPs
were also strongly related to standardized assessments of aca-

affect the results of the hierarchical linear models, the subsequent models did
not include offspring with missing values for prenatal alcohol exposure.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Correlations were calculated among the maternal covariates to
estimate the associations among PAE and maternal and famil-
ial characteristics to explore what factors predicted or were as-
sociated with PAE. All of the analyses in the present article were
weighted to produce estimates from a representative sample of
women in the United States.
Hierarchical linear models (HLMs) were used to explore and
characterize the associations between PAE and offspring ex-
ternalizing behaviors because of the nested nature of the data.39
When the NLSY79 and CNLSY samples are combined, there
are 3 levels of analysis: the offspring, maternal, and NLSY79
household levels.22 Five primary HLMs were fit to the associa-
tions between PAE and each measure of offspring externaliz-
ing problems.
Model 1 calculated the unadjusted relation between alco-
hol exposure, measured in mean number of days exposed per
week, and each dimension of externalizing behavior, control-
ling for offspring sex. The analyses included 8621 offspring of
4912 mothers. Although previous analyses suggested that off-
spring sex,6,40 maternal SDP,41 and family race/ethnicity42 may
moderate the associations, the factors did not affect the mag-
nitude of the relations between PAE and CPs or AIPs in the pres-
ent sample. The analyses also revealed that linear models pro-
vided the best fit for CPs and AIPs because the parameters
associated with a quadratic effect were small and statistically
nonsignificant.
Model 2 was fit to the relation between PAE and offspring
externalizing behaviors controlling for measured covariates that
could confound the association (listed in the "Measures" sub-
section of the "Methods" section).
Model 3 compared siblings differentially exposed to pre-
natal alcohol (ie, the mother drank alcohol during one preg-
nancy and not another or drank more during one pregnancy
than another). The within-mother association (ie, compari-
sons of the different offspring of each mother) provides a
more stringent test of causality because the comparison con-
trols for unmeasured genetic and environmental confounds
that vary between unrelated mothers. The analyses were
based on a subset of the families that included children with
differing amounts of exposure (3447 offspring from 1258
mothers). Siblings were compared using contrast codes.
Each offspring was assigned a value equal to the deviation of
the individual measure of PAE from the mean PAE of all the
children from the same mother. The contrast codes, there-
fore, reflect the amount of PAE relative (more or less) to the
mean PAE of all the children in the family. The model also
included comparisons of cousins born to NLSY79 mothers
who are sisters. Although the comparison of cousins is not
as strong as a within-mother approach, it can help provide
converging evidence concerning causal processes.43 Cousins
were also compared using contrast codes; cousins with more
PAE, on average, were compared with their cousins with less
PAE, on average. The model also compared unrelated indi-
viduals (mean PAE in all cousins from one extended family
compared with mean PAE in cousins in a separate extended
family). More details about how the contrast codes were cal-
culated,22,43 and the statistical justification for their use,44 can
be found elsewhere.
Model 4 combined the use of measured covariates and the
sibling and cousin comparisons, thus using statistical and meth-
odologic controls for potential confounds.
Model 5 tested whether PAE was associated with external-
izing problems in the subsample of children that included in-
formation on prenatal exposure to marijuana and cocaine. The
HLMs included prenatal exposure to alcohol, nicotine, mari-
juana, and cocaine and the sex of the offspring. Because the as-
sessment of all the substances was available only on a subset
of the sample, sibling comparisons could not be completed.
Multiple imputation was used for all of the HLMs that in-
cluded maternal and familial covariates to account for missing
values. The analyses, therefore, use all available data rather than
relying on families with complete maternal data. Given the as-
sumption that the missing values are missing at random or com-
pletely at random, multiple imputation yields standard errors
that account for uncertainty due to missing values and avoids
bias arising from complete-record analysis.45 Unstandardized
regression parameters were used because of the difficulty com-
paring standardized coefficients when exploring causal pro-
cesses,46 and measurement of PAE is in meaningful units (days
per week).
RESULTS
ASSOCIATIONS AMONG MEAN ALCOHOL USE
DURING PREGNANCY AND MATERNAL
AND FAMILIAL CHARACTERISTICS
Table 3 provides the associations among mean alcohol
use during pregnancy and maternal and familial charac-
teristics. Mean PAE across all pregnancies was slightly
correlated with maternal delinquency and age at first child-
birth. Mean PAE was more strongly related to substance
use measures, including mean levels of SDP, alcohol fre-
quency and quantity, and alcohol abuse and depen-
dence items. Binge drinking (Mbinge
-Mno binge
)=0.20,
where M represents the mean; P.001) and having chil-
drenwithdifferentbiologicalfathers(Mnot blended
-Mblended
)
=0.08; P.001) were also associated with PAE.
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PAE
AND OFFSPRING CPs
The results of the HLMs exploring the association be-
tween PAE and offspring CPs are given in Table 4. Model
1 indicates that for each additional day of PAE per week,
offspring had an increase of 0.09 SD in CPs (P.001).
Model 2 explored the association of PAE and CPs control-
ling for the main effects of race/ethnicity, prenatal nico-
tine exposure, and maternal covariates. Including the mea-
sured covariates slightly reduced the association between
PAE and offspring CPs (b=0.06, where b represents un-
standardized regression weight; P.001) compared with
model 1, but the model still revealed a positive and statis-
tically significant relation. The Figure presents the unad-
justed and adjusted means for CPs at each level of PAE.
The adjusted means are based on least squares estimates
after controlling for the measured covariates. The Figure
illustrates a positive association between PAE and CPs for
the entire sample; children exposed to more prenatal al-
cohol had more CPs than unrelated children with less PAE,
even after controlling for the measured covariates.

Model 3 provided a statistical comparison of siblings
differentially exposed to prenatal alcohol. The within-
mother association with PAE was still significant (b=0.05;
P=.03) and was commensurate with findings from the
comparison of cousins and unrelated individuals in the
model. The last model included the measured covari-
ates, and the statistical relation with PAE remained within
mothers (b=0.05; P=.04). The cousin comparisons in
models 3 and 4 also suggests that PAE is independently
associated with offspring CPs. The Figure also provides
an estimate of the association between PAE and CPs based
on the parameters from model 4. Children with more PAE
have more CPs than their siblings with less PAE while
controlling for the measured factors. The results of all
the models are consequently consistent with a causal as-
sociation between PAE and offspring CPs.
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PAE AND AIPs
The results of the HLMs for AIPs are given in Table 5.
Model 1 found an association between PAE and AIPs
(b=0.09 SD per days exposed per week). Model 2 con-
trolled for measured covariates, and the statistical asso-
ciation with PAE remained (b=0.06; P=.001). The re-
sults of model 3, the comparison of siblings (b=0.03;
P=.18), and model 4, the comparison of siblings con-
trolling for measured covariates (b=0.02; P=.24), re-
vealed greatly reduced and statistically nonsignificant as-
sociations. The comparison of cousins in model 4 also
revealed no association, further suggesting that the sta-
tistical association between PAE and AIPs is not causal.
The association between PAE and AIPs, therefore, seems
to be due primarily to characteristics related to PAE that
were not included in the previous analytical models.
ANALYSIS OF PAE CONTROLLING
FOR MATERNAL POLYSUBSTANCE USE
DURING PREGNANCY
Additional HLMs of the sample of children with data on
exposure to prenatal alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and mari-
juana were conducted. The results suggested that PAE
was independently associated with CPs; the magnitude
of the estimate (b±SE=0.04±0.03; P=.16) was commen-
surate with the results of the full sample, but the param-
eter could not be precisely estimated in the smaller sub-
sample. Consistent with the sibling comparisons,
statistically controlling for all of the measures of prena-
tal substance exposure resulted in no association be-
tween PAE and AIPs (b±SE=-0.01±0.15; P=.93).
COMMENT
The structure of relationships within families in this
sample provides a powerful natural laboratory for quasi-
experimental designs of environmental risk factors.16,26
The results of the present study indicate that there is an
association between PAE and CPs that was not due to
genetic factors related to maternal alcohol consumption
during pregnancy, to environmental factors correlated
with PAE that vary between unrelated mothers, or to a
variety of measured covariates, including maternal and
familial characteristics and exposure to multiple drugs
in utero. The findings thus support a strong inference
that PAE causes an increased risk of offspring CPs through
environmental processes.
Compared with children who were not exposed to any
alcohol in utero, the results suggest that offspring ex-

posed to prenatal alcohol every day of the week had an in-
crease of 0.35 SD in CPs (the parameter estimate in model
4 reflecting each additional day of exposure multiplied by
7 days). This finding is consistent with the previous re-
search that found robust associations between PAE and off-
spring externalizing problems, including studies that con-
trolled for characteristics of both parents7,8,13 and included
more precise measures of PAE.6 In addition, the present
causal inference regarding PAE and child CPs is consis-
tent with experimental animal studies,11 including re-
search in monkeys47 and mice,48 that found teratogenic ef-
fects of PAE. Therefore, prevention efforts should continue
to target alcohol consumption during pregnancy.24
AlthoughAIPswerestatisticallyassociatedwithPAEand
the association remained robust to the use of maternal co-
variates, PAE does not seem to be a causal risk factor for
AIPs. The comparison of siblings and cousins differen-
tiallyexposedtoprenatalalcoholwhilecontrollingformea-
sured characteristics revealed no (or a very limited) asso-
ciation. If the present analyses relied only on the use of
maternal covariates, we would have wrongly inferred that
PAE was a causal risk factor for AIPs. The analysis of the
subsample of children with information on prenatal expo-
sure to multiple drugs further provides converging evi-
dence in the study and suggests that maternal polysub-
stanceuseduringpregnancymayaccountfortheunadjusted
associations between PAE and AIPs. The finding that PAE
does not cause AIPs is also consistent with a recent re-
view9 and 1 extant behavior genetic study on PAE.14
The contrasting findings for CPs and AIPs underscore
the findings from imaging studies that different brain re-
gions may be more vulnerable to PAE. Structures such as
thebasalganglia,corpuscallosum,andparietalcortexseem
to be particularly susceptible to the effects of PAE.49,50 The
brain imaging results and studies comparing children with
high levels of PAE with those with ADHD51 highlight the
importance of exploring the specific neuroanotomical pro-
cessesthatmediateoraccountforassociationsbetweeneach
neurobehavioral problem associated with PAE.
The present study has many advantages. Most impor-
tant, the study used a quasi-experimental design that con-
trolled for genetic and environmental liability shared by
mothers and their offspring. The results also accounted
for measured maternal and familial characteristics and
maternal polysubstance use during pregnancy, a major
limitation of many existing studies.11 The results of the

aAll the parameters are unstandardized. Model 1 estimated the unadjusted relation between prenatal alcohol exposure and the externalizing behavior. Model 2
estimated the relation controlling for measured covariates. Model 3 compared siblings, cousins, and unrelated individuals who were differentially exposed to
prenatal alcohol. Model 4 provided the various comparison and controlled for the measured covariates. The HLMs indicated that offspring sex, maternal smoking
during pregnancy, and family race/ethnicity did not moderate the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and each measure of externalizing behavior. The
analyses also revealed that linear models, as opposed to nonlinear (quadratic) models, provided the best fit for each offspring measure. Including parity, family
size, and a variable representing the oldest age of the offspring assessed in the HLMs did not alter the findings.

study are also more highly generalizable than those of
many previous studies because the present results are
based on a sample of offspring of women in a large na-
tional study, which was weighted to be representative of
all women in the United States.
The present study has limitations that must be consid-
ered. First, quasi-experimental designs cannot prove cau-
sality.16 Theanalysesdonotaccountforeverypossiblevari-
able that could confound the relation. The only plausible
alternative explanation for the present findings is that an
unmeasured factor that varied between siblings and was
highly correlated with variations in PAE is the actual en-
vironmental causal factor. This might include variations
in maternal depression at the time of each pregnancy. It
could also include characteristics of different fathers when
they differed across siblings (I.D.W., B.M.D., C.A.V.H.,
J.L.R., P.J.R., and B.B.L., unpublished data, August 2007),7
but the analyses at least partially ruled out that explana-
tion by controlling for being in a blended family. A full ex-
ploration of the variation in alcohol use during pregnancy
within mothers is beyond the scope of the present analy-
ses, although some of the variation is related to the his-
torical reduction that has occurred during the longitudi-
nal NLSY79 study.52 Future studies will need to explore
additional risks that covary with PAE within mothers. Sec-
ond, the frequency measure of drinking during each preg-
nancy may not precisely measure PAE. The assessment of
maternal alcohol use during pregnancy was based on re-
ported frequency of alcohol consumption, which did not
include the amount of consumption per day or the tim-
ing.6 The assessment was also completed retrospectively.
However, the magnitude of the unadjusted associations is
consistent with previous research,11 and there is evidence
that retrospective reports of prenatal substance use are re-
liable53,54 and are perhaps even more valid than concur-
rent assessments.55
Third, the present design is based on variations in al-
cohol consumption across pregnancies.22 The present find-
ings are relevant to the general population only if women
who vary their consumption of alcohol across pregnan-
cies are not different from mothers who consistently drank
the same amount during each pregnancy. This assump-
tion may be warranted in the present analyses, as most
women (88%) who (1) ever drank during 1 pregnancy
and (2) had more than 1 child reported variation in their
alcohol use among their pregnancies. The difficulties in
accurately reporting alcohol consumption for different
children in a family by a mother could have affected the
sibling comparison analyses. The fact that the sibling and
cousin comparisons were comparable, however, sug-
gests that inaccurate measurement of PAE within moth-
ers cannot fully account for the findings.
Fourth, the present analyses explored moderators (off-
spring sex, maternal SDP, and family race/ethnicity) that
have been found to influence the effects of prenatal sub-
stance exposure,40-42 but other characteristics, including
genetic factors56 and stressful events,47 may also moder-
ate the effects of PAE.
Fifth, the present analyses could not determine whether
the confounding factors for AIPs were genetic or envi-
ronmental in origin. Use of the NLSY79 and the CNLSY
provides the opportunity to nest the sibling comparison
approach within a children-of-twins/siblings design, but
not all kinship relations are unambiguous.22 The most
recent wave of assessments in the NLSY79 (2006) ob-
tained more precise measures of genetic relatedness, so
future analyses will explore the nature of the confound-
ing factors with the full adult and offspring sample.
Sixth, the results are limited to externalizing prob-
lems during childhood reported by the mothers. Future
analyses will need to explore substance use outcomes or

other characteristics of adolescents.5,8 Seventh, the study
was conducted on a nationally representative sample in
which the prevalence of children with extremely high lev-
els of PAE was low. The finding of a linear association
between PAE and offspring externalizing problems is con-
sistent with previous research,49 but the sample may not
have included enough children exposed to high levels of
prenatal alcohol to explore whether there is a critical
threshold. Likewise, the results exploring the effects of
maternal polysubstance use during pregnancy must be
viewed cautiously because of the low prevalence of ex-
posure to cocaine and marijuana.
Finally, smaller studies of PAE can conduct more ex-
tensive assessments of PAE, offspring mental health prob-
lems, and potential confounds. Thus, the present large-
scale study complements but does not replace more
focused and intensive studies.
The present study, which was based on a representa-
tive sample, a rigorous design, and a sophisticated analyti-
cal approach to identify possible confounds, strengthens
the inference that PAE has a causal effect on the risk of CPs
in offspring. In contrast, the finding that unmeasured con-
founds related to PAE may be responsible for greater AIPs
in offspring suggests that the research community needs
to focus on putative environmental risk factors that are cor-
relatedwithmaternalsubstanceuseduringpregnancy,par-
ticularly ones that vary across siblings. The results are con-
sistent with research using different methods but further
emphasizetheneedforadditionalquasi-experimentalstud-
ies of prenatal substance exposure.
