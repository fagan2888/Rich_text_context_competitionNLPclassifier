Introduction
One of the primary goals of the modern human rights
movement has been stopping governments from torturing
their citizens. In order to achieve this goal, considerable
effort has been spent developing and promoting the adop-
tion of both international and domestic legal prohibitions of
torture. The efforts to promote both international and
domestic torture bans have largely been successful. In fact,
by 2011, 156 countries had become party to the Convention
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and 157 countries had
included torture prohibitions in their constitutions.1
The empirical scholarship testing the effectiveness
of these international and domestic torture prohibitions,
however, has produced mixed results. For example, stud-
ies testing the impact of the CAT have alternatively found
that ratification of the treaty is associated with increased
torture rates (Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui, 2005; Hathaway,
2004; Hill, 2010; Hollyer and Rosendorff, 2011;
Neumayer, 2005; Vreeland, 2008), has had no effect on
torture rates (Lupu, 2013; Powell and Staton, 2009), and
even that it is associated with decreases in torture rates
(Fariss, 2014, 2015). Similarly, studies testing the impact
of constitutional torture prohibitions have both found that
they have had no effect on torture rates (Chilton and
Versteeg, 2015; Keith et al., 2009; Melton, 2013) and that
they are associated with decreases in state repression (Hill
and Jones, 2014).
Part of the reason that this line of scholarship has pro-
duced conflicting results is that there are a number of sub-
stantial barriers to inference that make it difficult to assess
the effectiveness of these measures with observational data
alone. One of these barriers is that countries' decisions to
adopt international (Lupu, 2013) and domestic (Chilton
and Versteeg, 2015) torture prohibitions are endogenous
to their rights practices. Moreover, recent research has
suggested that a great deal of the data has been used to
International law, constitutional
law, and public support for torture

Abstract
The human rights movement has spent considerable energy developing and promoting the adoption of both international
and domestic legal prohibitions against torture. Empirical scholarship testing the effectiveness of these prohibitions using
observational data, however, has produced mixed results. In this paper, we explore one possible mechanism through
which these prohibitions may be effective: dampening public support for torture. Specifically, we conducted a survey
experiment to explore the impact of international and constitutional law on public support for torture. We found that
a bare majority of respondents in our control group support the use of torture, and that presenting respondents with
arguments that this practice violates international law or constitutional law did not produce a statistically significant
decrease in support. These findings are consistent with prior research suggesting, even in democracies, that legal
prohibitions on torture have been ineffective.

measure rates of torture is biased because reporting stand-
ards have changed over time (Fariss, 2014). Finally, even
if it were possible to overcome these barriers to inference,
it would still be difficult to disaggregate the impact of
international and domestic torture bans because countries
frequently adopt both forms of legal prohibitions (Chilton
and Tingley, 2013).
Given these hurdles that observational research
designs face, one increasingly common research strategy
has been to use experimental methods to test the mecha-
nisms that have been theorized as ways that legal restric-
tions may alter government behavior. More specifically,
experiments have been used to test whether explicit refer-
ences to international legal agreements results in changes
in public support for policies that would violate these
agreements (e.g. Chilton, 2014, 2015; McEntire et al.,
2015; Putnam and Shapiro, 2009; Tomz, 2008; Wallace,
2013, 2014). For torture, it has been suggested that
democracy is one of the mechanisms through which
torture prohibitions might matter (Simmons, 2009).
Specifically, it is possible that when the public is told that
torture violates the country's legal commitments, this
increases public disapproval of these practices. Although
experimental methods have their own limitations, they
do make it possible to design studies with high degrees
of internal validity, and, as a result, provide a valuable
supplement to the evidence that can be produced by
observational studies.
In order to comparatively test the effectiveness of both
international and domestic prohibitions on torture, we have
conducted what we believe to be the first survey experi-
ment that simultaneously tests the effect of exposing
respondents to arguments about the status of international
law and constitutional law. More specifically, we fielded a
survey experiment to a nationally representative sample of
adults in the United States that asked respondents whether
they supported the use of torture while randomly exposing
some respondents to arguments that torture violates inter-
national law or constitutional law (or both). We also built
on the limited prior research that has explored why argu-
ments about international law change public opinion
(Chilton, 2014), and asked the respondents a series of six
questions designed to test the mechanisms that may have
lead our treatments to change respondents' views.
Our results are consistent with recent polling that sug-
gests that a bare majority of Americans support the use of
torture. What is more, we found that presenting respond-
ents with the argument that torture violates international
law did not produce a statistically significant decrease in
support. Presenting respondents with the argument that
torture violates the constitution, however, lowered support
for torture by 4.6 percentage points (although the effect
falls just short of conventional levels of statistical signifi-
cance). That said, the difference between our international
law and constitutional law treatments was not itself
statistically significant. We do find a more substantial
effect for the sub-group of our respondents that identified
as Democrats. Yet, overall, our findings suggest that infor-
mation on the status of neither international law nor consti-
tutional law has a substantial effect on public support for
the use of torture.
Research design
Subject recruitment
We administered our experiment to a nationally represent-
ative sample of 2,159 US adults in October 2014. The
experiment was administered online, and Survey Sampling
International (SSI) recruited the respondents. SSI is a
research firm based in the United States that conducts sur-
veys for corporate and academic research. Our sample
was specifically designed to be nationally representative
of the US adult population based on gender, age, race, and
census region.2
Experimental design
We designed our experiment based on a survey used by
Wallace (2013) to explore the effect of commitments to
international law on public support for the use of torture.
Wallace's survey used a vignette to explore whether
respondents expressed lower support for using torture to
interrogate captured enemy combatants when they were
randomly assigned to a group that was told that torture
would violate international law and was prohibited by trea-
ties the United States had signed. The strengths of Wallace's
vignette are that it was designed to: (1) present a realistic
scenario; (2) not bias support of torture in any direction; (3)
avoid inflammatory language; and (4) present a neutral
stance of the effectiveness of torture (Wallace, 2013:
117­118).
Although our survey used Wallace's research as a start-
ing point, we made a number of substantial changes to his
experiment.3 Since Wallace's goal was to assess the effects
of international law on public opinion, his vignette focused
on the use of torture to interrogate enemy combatants. For
his purposes, the interrogation of enemy combatants pro-
vided a realistic scenario where respondents could be told
that the use of torture was prohibited by international law.
Since our goal is to compare the relative effectiveness of
international law and constitutional law, we needed a sce-
nario that was clearly prohibited by both international law
and the American constitution. The torture of enemy com-
batants, however, is not clearly prohibited by the constitu-
tion.4 As a result, our vignette did not stipulate that the
potential victims of torture where combatants from an
opposing side. Instead, our vignette focused on a scenario
where torture would plausibly be prohibited by both inter-
national and domestic law.5
Chilton and Versteeg 3
More specifically, we started our vignette by presenting
all respondents with the following scenario: "Throughout
history, people have plotted to overthrow or sabotage the
government, and have resorted to the use of violent means
to do so. Occasionally, the military captures people that are
conspiring to overthrow or sabotage the government
through violent means." The vignette then proceeded to say
that: "[t]hese individuals may have information of interest
about the conspiracy, such as the location of other conspira-
tors or plans for future attacks. Some government officials
believe interrogating these people through a variety of
methods is a useful way to obtain this information."
We then introduced the possibility of torture by saying
that: "[t]he interrogation methods could involve torture,
meaning they would cause severe pain or suffering to the
people they are used on." Moreover, we added that "[t]he
information may, or may not, be accurate or relevant to the
conspiracy." After this, the respondents were randomly pre-
sented with one of four treatment conditions. The four
treatments were as follows:
·
· Control: (No further information.)
·
· Int'l Law: "The interrogation methods would vio-
late international law. The United States has signed
international treaties that do not allow the use of
these methods under any circumstances."
·
· Con. Law: "The interrogation methods would vio-
late the constitution. The United States' Constitution
includes a provision that does not allow the use of
these methods under any circumstances."
·
· Combined: "The interrogation methods would vio-
late the constitution and international law. The
United States' Constitution includes a provision that
does not allow the use of these methods under any
circumstances, and the United States has signed
international treaties that do not allow the use of
these methods under any circumstances."6
The respondents in the Control group were not presented
with an argument about the legal status of the use of torture.
The inclusion of this control group gives us a baseline to
compare the subsequent treatment groups against.7 The
respondents in the Int'l Law group were presented with the
argument that the use of these methods violates interna-
tional law. The wording of this treatment condition is iden-
tical to the international law treatment used by Wallace
(2013). The respondents in the Con. Law group were pre-
sented with the argument that the use of these methods vio-
lates the constitution. This treatment condition was
designed to be as similar to the Int'l Law group as possible
(for example, the treatments include the same number of
words, tone, and sentence structure). Finally, respondents
in the Combined group were presented with both argu-
ments. Offering some respondents both arguments
allows us to evaluate whether there is an "additive" or
"substitution" effect to being given both arguments
(Chilton, 2015; Tomz, 2008).
After being presented with the vignette and one of the
four randomly assigned treatments, respondents were
asked: "[t]o what extent do you agree or disagree with the
following statement: The United States should use interro-
gation methods involving torture on people that have plot-
ted to overthrow or sabotage the government." The
respondents were then asked to provide an answer on a six-
point scale that included the following options: (1) "strongly
disagree"; (2) "disagree"; (3) "lean towards disagree"; (4)
"lean towards agree"; (5) "agree"; and (6) "strongly agree."
Following Wallace (2013), we converted these responses
into a binary variable for easier interpretation. Our results
are substantively similar, however, when using the full six-
point response variable as the dependent variable.8
Balance
In addition to presenting respondents with the vignette
described above, we also asked respondents a series of
demographic questions.9 Doing so not only allows us to
confirm that our respondents are nationally representative
based on their gender, age, race, and census region, but also
allows us to ensure that the demographic characteristics of
the respondents in each of our treatment groups were bal-
anced. To do so, we followed Chaudoin (2014) and used the
balance test from Hansen and Bowers (2008). Using this
test, the overall 2 statistic and the associated overall p-val-
ues for each group are: Control, 11.10 (p = 0.35); Int'l Law,
3.47 (p = 0.97); Con. Law, 9.02 (p = 0.53); and Combined,
4.95 (p = 0.90). Thus, we did not find any evidence of
demographic imbalance across our four treatment groups.
Results
Primary results
Figure 1 presents the primary results of our experiment.10
Since we did not find any evidence of imbalance across our
randomly assigned treatments, Figure 1 simply reports the
mean responses--and 90% confidence intervals (CIs)--for
each of the four treatment groups.11 All of our results, how-
ever, are substantively the same when estimated using
regressions that control for the demographic characteristics
of the respondents.12
As Figure 1 shows, respondents in the Control group
were on balance more likely to agree than disagree with
the use of torture. For the control group, the mean level of
support for using torture against people that have plotted to
overthrow the government is 51.1% (90% CI: 47.4%,
54.7%). This number closely tracks the recent public poll-
ing on the use of torture: a 2011 Pew survey found that
53% of Americans said that torture could often or some-
times be justified,13 and a 2013 Associated Press-NORC
4 Research and Politics 
Center for Public Affairs Research survey found that 50%
of Americans said that torture could often or sometimes be
justified.14
Respondents in the Int'l Law group had a mean response
of 49.2% (90% CI: 45.6%, 52.7%). Although the respond-
ents given the international law treatment did express lower
support for the use of torture than the control group, the
difference between the two groups is not statistically sig-
nificant (p = 0.54). The respondents in the Con. Law group
had a mean response of 46.5% (90% CI: 43.0%, 50.0%).
Although the difference between the Control group and the
Con. Law group is not statistically significant at the 0.1
level using the binary response variable (p = 0.14), it is sta-
tistically significant when using the full six-point response
variable, albeit only at the 0.1 level (p = 0.08). That said,
the difference in support between the Int'l Law group and
the Con. Law group is not statistically different (p = 0.38).
Figure 1 also reveals that the respondents in the
Combined group had a mean response of 50.2% (90% CI:
46.7%, 53.7%). Interestingly, this is only slightly lower
than the mean response for the Control group (p = 0.77).
Moreover, the Combined group--whose members were
presented with both the international law and constitutional
law treatments--were more supportive of torture than the
respondents that were given either just the international law
treatment or the constitutional law treatment. Since the dif-
ferences between the Combined group and the other treat-
ments are substantially small and far from statistically
significant,15 we believe that it would be inappropriate to
put much weight on them.
It is still interesting, however, that the respondents that
received the Combined treatment were more likely to sup-
port torture than the respondents receiving either treatment
individually. Given the evidence from Tomz (2008) and
Chilton (2015) that arguments about the status of interna-
tional law had an additive effect when combined with non-
legal arguments, this is a surprising result that likely cannot
simply be explained by the fact that the respondents that
were presented with the combined treatment were less
likely to read their slightly longer vignette. One possible
explanation for our results is that these previous studies did
not test combining two legal arguments, and instead com-
bined arguments about international law with economic or
moral arguments. It is possible that informing respondents
that government officials are advocating for using interro-
gation techniques including torture despite the fact that it
would violate international law and the constitution sends a
signal that these officials have particularly good reasons for
wanting to use torture in that instance. More research will
have to be conducted, however, to verify the higher support
for rights violations when using combined legal treatments
and to test the theory we have suggested.
Taken together, these results do not reveal any statisti-
cally significant differences between our four treatment
groups. Given these null results, it is reasonable to calculate
how large a difference between the control group and a
treatment group would have been needed to find a statisti-
cally significant result. With our samples sizes and standard
deviations, it would have taken an effect size of roughly
5.4% to find a difference that was statistically significant at
the 0.1 level and an effect size of roughly 6.0% to find a
difference that was statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
To put this in perspective, the level of support for torture
was 4.6% lower for our Con. Law group compared to the
Control group (which, as previously noted, fell just short of
statistical significance at the 0.1 level).
Results by party identification
We also examined whether the political affiliations of the
respondents influenced their responses.16 The results bro-
ken out by respondents that identified themselves as either
Democrats or Republicans are presented in Figure 2.17
There are three things worth nothing about our results
based on party identification. First, Democrats in all four
treatment groups were consistently less likely than
Republicans to support the use of torture: the mean response
for Democrats was 47.8% (90% CI: 45.1%, 50.6%),
whereas the mean response for Republicans was 61.7%
(90% CI: 58.1%, 65.2%). This is consistent with both pub-
lic polling showing that Republicans are more supportive
of torture18 and the finding in Wallace (2013) that conserva-
tives were more likely to support torture than liberals.
Second, the international law and constitutional law
treatments had an effect on support for torture among
Democrats but not Republicans. For Democrats, both the
Int'l Law group and Con. Law group had a lower mean
response than the Control group that is statistically signifi-
cant at the 0.05 level. The Control group for Democrats
had a mean response of 55.4% (90% CI: 49.5%, 61.3%),
while the Int'l Law group had a mean response of 43.9%
(90% CI: 38.4%, 49.4%) and the Con. Law group had a
mean response of 43.9% (90% CI: 38.6%, 49.1%). For
Republicans, however, the results for all four treatment

Chilton and Versteeg 5
conditions are nearly identical. This result is consistent
with the finding in Wallace (2013) that the international
law treatment lowered support for torture among liberals,
but had almost no effect on support for torture among
conservatives.
Third, it is puzzling that our results by party identifica-
tion are consistent with Wallace (2013), but that our over-
all results are not consistent with Wallace's finding that
presenting respondents with arguments that torture vio-
lates international law statistically significantly lowers
support for torture. We explored three possibilities for this
inconsistency. First, we considered whether this inconsist-
ency is due to the composition of our samples. Wallace's
sample had 26% self-reported liberals, while our sample
had 41% self-reported Democrats. We do not think that
this cannot explain the inconsistency, because our larger
proportion of Democrats should bias us towards finding
statistically significant results in the full sample. Second,
we considered whether this inconsistency emerges because
our treatment groups are not balanced based on party iden-
tification. Re-conducting the balance test from Hansen and
Bowers (2008) while including variables for Democrats,
Republicans, and Independents, however, does not reveal
any evidence that our treatment groups are not balanced.19
Third, we considered whether this inconsistency arises
because of differences between the responses of moderates
in Wallace's sample and the responses of independents
in our sample. Wallace's replication data reveals that
moderates presented with his international law treatment
were 7.5% less likely to support the use of torture than
respondents in his control group.20 In contrast, in our sam-
ple independents presented with the international law
treatment were nearly 10% more likely to support the use
of torture than the control group, and independents pre-
sented with the constitutional law treatment were 0.04%
more likely to support the use of torture than the Control
group. This suggests that the inconsistencies between our
overall results and Wallace (2013) are due to the independ-
ents responding negatively or neutrally to our law treat-
ments. Future research should explore whether this is due
to changes in the views of independents over time, the dif-
ferences in our vignettes, or idiosyncrasies in the composi-
tion of our samples.
Mechanism questions
We also attempted to test the mechanisms that may lead
arguments about international law or constitutional law to
change public support for torture. To our knowledge, the
only previous study that has directly explored possible
mechanisms for why arguments about international change
public opinion was Chilton (2014). After conducting an
experiment on how arguments about international law
change support for solitary confinement, Chilton (2014)
asked respondents questions designed to test reasons why
the international law argument changed respondents'views.
The results suggested that the respondents that received the
argument about international law were more likely to
believe that it was important that the US treatment of pris-
oners conform to international standards.
Figure 2. Results by party identification (mean response and 90% CIs).
6 Research and Politics 
After respondents read our vignette, we also asked" to
read: we also asked a series of six additional questions to
assess the mechanisms through which our international law
and constitutional law treatments may influence public sup-
port for the use of torture. Those questions are reported in
Table 1. We randomized the order respondents were asked
these six questions, and for each we asked for responses on
a five-point scale (with 5 representing strong agreement
and 1 representing strong disagreement). The responses to
these six questions are presented in Figure 3.
Overall, the results in Figure 3 indicate that the treat-
ments that respondents received while reading our
vignette had essentially no influence on the subsequent
responses to the six mechanism questions we asked. In
fact, the differences in mean responses for the Control
group and the Int'l Law group were not statistically sig-
nificant at the 0.1 level for a single one of the six mecha-
nism questions. This is perhaps unsurprising given that,
as the previous results sections revealed, the responses
for the Control group and the Int'l Law group for our
Table 1. Mechanism questions.
International standards Should the United States' interrogation practices always conform to international standards?
Constitutional standards Should the United States' interrogation practices always conform to US constitutional standards?
Risk to Americans If the United States tortures, do you think that other countries will be more likely to torture
captured Americans?
Risk to others If the United States tortures, do you think that other countries will be more likely to torture their
own citizens?
Valuable information Do you think the use of torture by the United States is likely to produce valuable information that
could not otherwise be obtained?
Morality Is the use of torture immoral?

primary experiment were not different in a statistically
significant way.
There were, however, statistically significant differ-
ences between the Control group and Con. Law group for
two of the six questions. The respondents who received the
constitutional law treatment were less likely to think that
torture produces Valuable information (p = 0.03) and less
likely to think that the United States interrogation practices
should conform to International standards (p = 0.01). One
explanation for why respondents in the Con. Law group
may believe that torture is less likely to produce valuable
information than respondents in the control group is that
respondents may believe that these interrogation techniques
would not have been constitutionally prohibited if they pro-
duce important information. In other words, the constitu-
tional law argument may prime respondents to think that
torture is less useful. One explanation for why respondents
in the Con. Law group are less likely to think that United
States' interrogation practices should conform to
International Standards than respondents in the Control
group is that the respondents may think that international
standards are less relevant after they have been told about
domestic, constitutional standards that restrict torture. For
example, if the respondents in the Con. Law group thought
that the constitution had stricter limits on torture than inter-
national law, they would be less likely to think that the
United States' interrogation practices should "always con-
form" to international standards.
Although these are small differences for only two of the
six mechanisms questions, it does provide some addi-
tional--but admittedly very weak--evidence that informa-
tion on constitutional law has a slightly larger effect on
support for torture than information on international law.
That said, like with our primary results, the difference in
mean responses between the Int'l Law group and Con. Law
group for both the "International standards" and "Valuable
information" questions were substantively small and far
from statistically significant.
Conclusion
Our experiment was designed to explore how information
about international law and constitutional law impacts pub-
lic support for the use of torture. While we found no evi-
dence that information about international law changed
public opinion, we found some weak evidence that infor-
mation about constitutional law did. Specifically, using a
binary response scale, we found that presenting respond-
ents with the argument that constitutional law prohibits tor-
ture lowered public support for torture by 4.6 percentage
points. The effect, however, falls outside conventional lev-
els of statistical significance. That said, although the argu-
ment about constitutional law had a slightly larger effect
than the argument about international law, there was not a
statistically significantly difference between these two
arguments. In general, our findings suggest that presenting
respondents with the arguments that international law and
constitutional law prohibits torture has little effect on pub-
lic support for its use.21
It is worth noting that there are several limitations to
our research design that may limit the generalizability of
our results. First, since respondents may already be aware
that international law and constitutional law prohibit tor-
ture, our experiment cannot directly test the effect that
international and constitutional torture prohibitions have
on public opinion. Instead, our experiment can only test
the effect that presenting respondents with arguments
about the status of these sources of law has on public sup-
port for torture. As a result, despite the fact that our inter-
national law and constitutional law treatments had little
effect, it may be the case that both international and
domestic torture prohibitions do have an impact on pub-
lic support for torture, but that we simply cannot measure
it because our control group is also aware of the prohibi-
tions. Second, we only tested one vignette on a sample of
respondents from one country. It may be the case that
arguments about the status of international and constitu-
tional law would have a different effect in other scenar-
ios, or that respondents from other countries would have
responded differently than the sample we recruited in the
United States.
Despite those limitations, our findings do help to
explain existing findings from observational studies on
the effectiveness of torture prohibitions. Our finding is
consistent with the observational studies that suggest that
CAT ratification (e.g. Lupu, 2013; Powell and Staton,
2009) and constitutional torture prohibitions (e.g. Chilton
and Versteeg, 2015; Keith et al., 2009) do not reduce
torture. Our research is also consistent with studies that
suggest that even democratic governments are likely
to engage in torture--especially in the face of terror
threats or violent dissent (Conrad and Moore, 2010;
Davenport et al., 2007; Goderis and Versteeg, 2012;
Rejali, 2007; Wantchekon and Healy, 1999). While our
findings do not directly prove that lack of popular support
indeed causes legal torture prohibitions to fail, they
suggest that this is at least a factor that contributes to
their ineffectiveness.

Notes
 1. Maps showing the prevalence of international and constitu-
tional torture bans are provided in the online Supplementary
Appendix.
 2. Summary statistics for our sample are reported in the online
SupplementaryAppendix. Both SSI's internal information on
the respondent that completed our survey and the responses
to the demographic questions in our survey suggest that our
sample is consistent with census estimates of the US adult
population based on gender, age, race, and census region.
3. We believe that these differences are substantial enough
to make it inappropriate to directly compare our results to
Wallace (2013). Moreover, in addition to changing the topic
of our vignette, our survey was administered five years
after Wallace's. For instance, Wallace's 2009 survey found
that 44% of respondents in his control group supported the
use of torture (Wallace, 2013: 120), while 51% of respond-
ents in our control group supported the use of torture. This
increase is consistent with public opinion polling showing
that American's have become more accepting of torture over
that time period (see Lyte, 2014; Gronke et al., 2010).

respondents in the control group may already be aware that
torture is prohibited by international law and the constitution,
it is unfortunately impossible to have a perfect control group
for this type of experiment. This suggests that our experi-
ment thus provides a hard test of whether international or
constitutional law changes public opinion.
 8. Results using the full six-point response scale are presented
in the online Supplementary Appendix.
9. We asked the demographic questions in our survey before
presenting respondents with the vignette.
10. Numerical results for all of our figures are reported in the
online Supplemental Appendix.
11. Because we primarily found null effects, we elected to use a
90% CI to avoid rejecting treatment effects too quickly. We
note, however, that none of the treatment effects are statisti-
cally significant at the more conventional 95% level.
12. These results are presented in the online Supplemental
Appendix.

15. The difference in support between the Combined group and
the Int'l Law group has a p-value of 0.74, and the difference
between the Combined group and the Con. Law group has a
p-value of 0.22.
16. We should note that, following Chilton (2014) and Wallace
(2013), analyzing our results by party identification was part
of our initial analysis plan.
17. Out of the 2,159 respondents in our sample, 891 identified
themselves as Democrats (41%) and 514 identified them-
selves as Republicans (24%). Recent polling from the Pew
research center suggests that 32% of Americans identify as
Democrats and 23% as Republicans. See http://www.people-
press.org/interactives/party-id-trend/ (accessed 24 August
2015). Since our survey slightly oversampled Democrats and
our treatment effect were larger for Democrats, it suggests
that our null findings are not due to our sample being ideo-
logically unrepresentative.
18. See Lyte (2014). See also Gronke et al., (2010).
19. While including the party identification variables, the overall
2 statistic and the associated overall p-values for each group
are: Control, 19.4 (p = 0.11); Int'l Law, 10.9 (p = 0.62); Con.
Law, 13.5 (p = 0.41); and Combined, 8.01 (p = 0.84).

21. It is worth noting that our findings diverge slightly, however,
from the finding in Wallace (2013) that presenting respond-
ents with information about international law slightly
reduces public support for torture. As previously noted,
however, we made a substantive change to the vignette by
asking respondents about torturing individuals trying to over
throw the government instead of torturing combatants from
an opposing side of a conflict. Wallace's vignette focused on
prisoners of war, and there may be good reasons for respond-
ents to be more responsive to information on international
law when considering conduct during war. For example,
although democracies may be no more likely to restrain from
torturing domestically because of international human rights
treaties (Lupu, 2013; Powell and Staton, 2009), there is evi-
dence suggesting that democracies are more likely to com-
ply with the laws of war because of the threat of reciprocity
(Chilton, 2015; Morrow, 2014; but see also Downes, 2008).
Respondents to Wallace's survey may have thus thought that
compliance with international law was more important when
dealing with the enemy from an opposing side of a conflict.
