Abstract
Background: According to Good Clinical Practice, clinical trials must protect rights and safety of patients and make
sure that the trial results are valid and interpretable. Monitoring on-site has an important role in achieving these objec-
tives; it controls trial conduct at trial sites and informs the sponsor on systematic problems. In the past, extensive on-site
monitoring with a particular focus on formal source data verification often lost sight of systematic problems in study pro-
cedures that endanger Good Clinical Practice objectives. ADAMON is a prospective, stratified, cluster-randomised, con-
trolled study comparing extensive on-site monitoring with risk-adapted monitoring according to a previously published
approach.
Methods: In all, 213 sites from 11 academic trials were cluster-randomised between extensive on-site monitoring (104)
and risk-adapted monitoring (109). Independent post-trial audits using structured manuals were performed to determine
the frequency of major Good Clinical Practice findings at the patient level. The primary outcome measure is the propor-
tion of audited patients with at least one major audit finding. Analysis relies on logistic regression incorporating trial and
monitoring arm as fixed effects and site as random effect. The hypothesis was that risk-adapted monitoring is non-
inferior to extensive on-site monitoring with a non-inferiority margin of 0.60 (logit scale).
Results: Average number of monitoring visits and time spent on-site was 2.1 and 2.7 times higher in extensive on-site
monitoring than in risk-adapted monitoring, respectively. A total of 156 (extensive on-site monitoring: 76; risk-adapted
monitoring: 80) sites were audited. In 996 of 1618 audited patients, a total of 2456 major audit findings were documen-
ted. Depending on the trial, findings were identified in 18%­99% of the audited patients, with no marked monitoring
effect in any of the trials. The estimated monitoring effect is 20.04 on the logit scale with two-sided 95% confidence
interval (20.40; 0.33), demonstrating that risk-adapted monitoring is non-inferior to extensive on-site monitoring. At
most, extensive on-site monitoring could reduce the frequency of major Good Clinical Practice findings by 8.2% com-
pared with risk-adapted monitoring.
Conclusion: Compared with risk-adapted monitoring, the potential benefit of extensive on-site monitoring is small
relative to overall finding rates, although risk-adapted monitoring requires less than 50% of extensive on-site monitoring
resources. Clusters of findings within trials suggest that complicated, overly specific or not properly justified protocol
requirements contributed to the overall frequency of findings. Risk-adapted monitoring in only a sample of patients
appears sufficient to identify systematic problems in the conduct of clinical trials. Risk-adapted monitoring has a part to
play in quality control. However, no monitoring strategy can remedy defects in quality of design. Monitoring should be
embedded in a comprehensive quality management approach covering the entire trial lifecycle.

Introduction
According to Good Clinical Practice (GCP), clinical
trials must protect rights and safety of patients and
make sure that the trial results are valid and interpreta-
ble. Monitoring on-site has an important role in achiev-
ing these objectives; it controls trial conduct at trial sites
and informs the sponsor on systematic problems. In the
past, on-site monitoring with a particular focus on
extensive, but non-targeted source data verification
often lost sight of systematic problems in trial proce-
dures, thereby endangering GCP objectives.1,2 In light of
the fact that monitoring is time consuming and generates
extensive costs, the efficacy of this expenditure is being
questioned more and more.3,4 New regulatory guidance,
including the recently released addendum to the GCP
Guideline (International Council for Harmonisation
of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use E6 R2),5 recommends optimising the effi-
cacy of monitoring and complementing it with other
measures to make better use of available resources.1,2,6
In 2004, implementation of the European Union's
Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC was a challenge in
particular for academic investigator­initiated trials.
Frequency and extent of the necessary on-site monitor-
ing were unclear and cost-efficient approaches were
urgently needed, but difficult to implement due to a lack
of clear guidance. Therefore, we developed a structured
approach to perform risk analysis and define corre-
sponding risk-adapted monitoring strategies, published
in 2009.7
The main idea was to focus monitoring on trial-
specific risks to essential GCP objectives, namely, to
assure that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of
trial subjects are protected and their safety ensured and
that data and reported results are reliable. This tool is
referenced in the European Medicines Agency's reflec-
tion paper on risk-based quality management1 as well
as in the US Food and Drug Administration Guidance
on a risk-based approach to monitoring.2
The Risk ADApted MONitoring (ADAMON) study
was set up to investigate whether a trial-specific, risk-
adapted, reduced on-site monitoring strategy as pro-
posed in Brosteanu et al.7 is as effective as an extensive,
non-targeted on-site monitoring strategy in preventing
major or critical violation of GCP objectives, as ascer-
tained by independent audits at the end of the trial.
Methods
Study design
ADAMON is a stratified, cluster-randomised non-
inferiority study. Trial sites within participating clinical
trials were randomised either to extensive or to risk-
adapted monitoring.7 Cluster randomisation was used
because monitoring affects trial sites as a whole by
retraining local staff concerning trial procedures trig-
gered by detected findings. In addition, applying differ-
ent monitoring strategies to individual patients within
one site was deemed unfeasible.
Inclusion criteria for trials were as follows: rando-
mised, multicentre (at least six trial sites) clinical trials
with a non-commercial sponsor; having Standard
Operating Procedures for data management and trial
supervision, central monitoring of at least basic extent,
and classification as K2 (intermediate risk) or K3 (low
risk) based on a trial-specific analysis as proposed in
Brosteanu et al.7 The classification is based on the fol-
lowing components: (a) the potential risk of the thera-
peutic intervention evaluated in the trial as compared
to standard medical care, (b) the presence of at least
one of a list of risk indicators for the patient or the trial
results and (c) the robustness of trial procedures (reli-
able and easy to assess primary endpoint, simple trial
procedures). A trial belongs to K3 (low risk) if the risk
of the therapeutic intervention is comparable to that of
standard medical care, no other risk indicators are
present and the trial procedures are robust. In contrast,
a trial belongs to K1 (high risk) if either the risk of the
therapeutic intervention is higher than that of standard
medical care, and other risk indicators are present, or if
the risk of the therapeutic intervention is markedly
higher than that of standard medical care. Trials in
monitoring class K1 (high risk) were not included, since
in K1 extensive on-site monitoring is only marginally
more extensive than risk-adapted monitoring.
Extensive on-site monitoring comprised checking
existence of trial subjects, informed consent documents
and complete source data verification for all patients.
Visits were scheduled as frequently as necessary in order
to fulfil the aforementioned monitoring tasks (at least
annually while patients in trial).
Risk-adapted on-site monitoring depended on the
assigned monitoring class (K2 or K3) and the monitor-
ing findings at the first visit as well as during the trial
(for details, see Table 1).
Outcomes
Primary endpoint of the ADAMON study is the pro-
portion of audited patients with at least one major or
critical violation of essential GCP objectives in one or
more of five error domains: informed consent process,
patient selection (eligibility criteria critical for safety
and/or efficacy), intervention (protocol deviation with
impact on patient safety or data validity), endpoint
Brosteanu et al. 585
assessment and serious adverse event reporting. Major
or critical GCP violations (in the following referred to
as `major audit findings') were determined in indepen-
dent ADAMON audits at the end of the trial looking
at all individual patients in all participating trial sites.
Auditors were not in contact with monitors and had no
vested interest in the trial. The proportions of patients
with major audit findings in specific error domains were
assessed as secondary endpoints.
For supportive analysis, the proportion of patients
with major audit findings that were not already identi-
fied by on-site monitoring during the trial was listed as
further secondary endpoint. Monitoring findings were
extracted retrospectively from monitoring reports.
Monitoring reports used templates provided by the
respective trial sponsor. However, the supportive anal-
ysis turned out to be only feasible for the informed
consent process for which monitoring reports included
patient-level lists of findings. For other error domains,
the different documentation systems for monitoring
and audit findings precluded their comparison and
reconciliation.
Measures against bias
Randomisation of trial sites within participating trials
was performed centrally in Leipzig stratified by accrual
potential (small vs large, if available) and type of site
(University Clinic, General Hospital, Surgery, if appli-
cable). The ratio was 1:1, except in one trial 1:2 (extensi-
ve:risk-adapted) due to resource limitations. Trial sites
were informed by their respective trial sponsor about
ADAMON and the planned audits, but not about the
assigned monitoring arm.
Audits were standardised using detailed trial-specific
audit manuals developed by the ADAMON team.
Manuals defined trial-specific protocol requirements to
be verified and GCP violations to be counted as major
ADAMON audit findings. They counted as audit find-
ings only if they still persisted at the time of auditing.
GCP violations remedied by appropriate monitoring
follow-up actions were not counted.
Audit findings were documented on an audit case report
form separately for each patient of the respective trial site
(refer to supplement for a sample audit manual and audit
case report form in German). ADAMON audits were per-
formed jointly by teams of two ADAMON-trained audi-
tors. Auditors came from separate institutions and had no
prior involvement in the audited trial. Preferably, the same
team audited all trial sites of one trial. Audit teams were
not informed of the sites' monitoring strategy and did not
have access to any monitoring reports.
Audit findings were reviewed in a blinded manner by
members of the ADAMON team and discussed with
auditors, as necessary, to ensure that reporting was con-
sistent with the ADAMON audit manuals.

aIn ADAMON, assessment of the trial site as `with' or `without noticeable problems' followed a process detailed in the trial-specific monitoring
manuals. The monitor assessed and documented noticeable problems, taking into account compliance with ICH-GCP and the protocol as well as the
resources of the site staff to conduct the trial. This was checked and confirmed by the trial's project manager.

Procedures
For each screened trial, a structured risk analysis
according to Brosteanu et al.7 was agreed upon between
the ADAMON and the respective trial team, and a
monitoring class was determined. In addition, existing
procedures for central oversight and data management
were discussed. For eligible trials, a contract concerning
ADAMON participation was concluded with the trial
sponsor.
Key data were defined and trial-specific manuals
developed for each monitoring strategy. These manuals
were the basis for contracts with the trial sponsors.
ADAMON funded extra monitoring costs arising from
participation in ADAMON.
Conduct of monitoring was the responsibility of
the respective trial sponsor. For each monitoring strat-
egy, disjoint teams of monitors were trained by the
ADAMON team. The ADAMON team received
the monitoring reports and supervised adherence to the
monitoring manuals, providing additional training for
monitors if required.
Statistical analysis
Both the intervention (monitoring strategy) as well as
the endpoint assessment (audit) were customised to
each trial, but using a common structured approach.
Trials varied in complexity. Finding rates are thus only
comparable within each trial. ADAMON relies on
meta-analysing results obtained within each trial, with
a model assuming that trial-specific differences between
extensive on-site monitoring and risk-adapted monitor-
ing on the logit scale (i.e. log odds ratios) are compara-
ble across trials.
The protocol-specified analysis is logistic regression
incorporating trial and monitoring arm as fixed effects
and trial site as a single random effect, corresponding
to a fixed-effect meta-analysis. In addition, it assumes
that the variance of site random effects can be estimated
across trials; such estimates may be unstable with only
few sites for a given trial.
As a sensitivity analysis, we also present a standard
random-effect meta-analysis of separate and indepen-
dent trial-specific treatment effects on the logit scale
obtained with logistic regression with monitoring arm
as fixed effect and site as a random effect.
Primary result of the ADAMON study is an esti-
mate (with 95% confidence interval) of the effect of
risk-adapted monitoring on the proportion of patients
with major audit findings.
ADAMON set out to recruit 12 trials with at least
100 randomised trial sites accruing at least 3200
patients to achieve a power of 80%. This was based on
simulations assuming an average of 10­30 patients
included per site, variance of the site random effect of
0.6­1 on the logit scale (describing the cluster effect;
corresponding intra-class correlation coefficient
between 0.033 and 0.09) and an overall finding rate of
5%­10%.8 Evidence for these planning assumptions
were limited.
The non-inferiority margin was set to 0.60 on the logit
scale. In the planning scenario, this corresponded to an
increase in finding rate from 7% with extensive on-site
monitoring to 12% with risk-adapted monitoring.
Results
Trials
Between April 2009 and June 2012, 30 clinical trials
were screened and 15 included. Of those, two never
started recruitment, and a further two terminated very
early due to insufficient accrual. ADAMON audits
were performed in the remaining 11 trials (Figure 1).
Table 2 alphabetically lists and characterises these
trials,9­16 which cover a broad spectrum of indications.
Three trials were assessed as monitoring class K3 (low
risk). In 5 of the 11 trials (HYPRESS, HD16, CLL10,
TABEA and SYNCHRONOUS, for full trial names
see Table 2), only a sample of trial sites took part in
ADAMON. In NIC-PD, only the German trial sites
were involved. For all further analyses, the 11 trials are
pseudonymised using an internal trial number unre-
lated to the alphabetical order.
Trial sites and audits
Overall, 213 trial sites were randomised between exten-
sive (104) and risk-adapted (109) monitoring. Of the
sites, 27 sites never recruited any patient; 186 trials sites,
89 of which were monitored extensively and 97 in a
risk-adapted manner, recruited a total of 1967 patients.
From these, 30 sites with 47 patients were not audited:
one site refused the audit, and in the last five audited
trials, 29 sites with less than three patients were not
audited due to limited resources (Figure 1). Thus, 156
sites were audited and included in the final analysis: 76
extensively monitored sites, which had enrolled 955
patients, and 80 sites monitored in a risk-adapted man-
ner, which had enrolled 965 patients.
In five trials, audits took place as planned after last
patient last visit. Due to funding and time limitations,
audits were performed in four trials after last patient
in, but before end of trial (mainly trials with long-term
follow-up per patient). In two trials, accrual was still
ongoing at the time trial sites were audited; in these
cases, audits were restricted to patients having com-
pleted their treatment.
Files from 1618 of 1967 patients (82.3%) were actu-
ally audited. Audit duration was limited to 5 days;
thus, in large sites (.45 patients), only a centrally pre-
selected random sample of patients was audited. Arms
are not fully balanced in numbers of patients audited
Brosteanu et al. 587
(755 extensive on-site monitoring and 863 risk-adapted
monitoring) overall; this is mainly due to large variance
in site sizes. Of the audited patients, 1376 (85.0%) were
audited by teams of two or three auditors as planned;
242 patients (15.0%) from small sites were audited by a
single auditor after participating in calibrating team
audits.
Auditing required 523 auditor days on-site, roughly
2.6 auditor years. Average audit duration per patient
was 2.6 h and similar between monitoring arms (2.7
extensive on-site monitoring and 2.5 risk-adapted
monitoring).
Implementation of monitoring
Monitoring efforts differed markedly by monitoring
strategy within each participating trial (Figure S1 and
Figure S2 supplement). With extensive on-site monitor-
ing, the number of monitoring visits per patient and the
cumulative monitoring time on-site was higher com-
pared to risk-adapted monitoring by a factor of 2.1 and
2.7, respectively (ratios of the efforts calculated within
each trial and summarised with the geometric mean).
As expected, these factors were more pronounced in
(low risk) monitoring class K3 (3.5 and 5.2 in K3 vs 1.8
and 2.1 in K2). Average number of visits per site was
5.4 (K3: 4.9; K2: 5.7) with extensive and 2.7 (K3: 1.03;
K2: 3.7) with risk-adapted monitoring.
Audit findings
Overall, 2456 major audit findings were documented in
996 of 1618 (61.6%) audited patients. Table 3 describes
trials and their finding rates overall and by monitoring
strategy. Overall finding rates differ markedly between
participating trials. Patient-level finding rates ranged
from 18% to 99%. Broken down by error domain,
241/1618 patients (14.9%) had at least one finding in
informed consent process, 331 (20.5%) in patient selec-
tion, 405 (25.0%) in intervention, 420 (26.0%) in end-
point assessment and 295 (18.2%) in serious adverse
event reporting. Monitoring strategies can only be
compared within each trial and site effects have to be
accounted for when analysing these raw data.
The ADAMON protocol specified a generalised lin-
ear mixed model, namely, logistic regression with trials

and monitoring arm as fixed effects and sites as a single
random effect over all trials. The estimated standard
deviation of the random effect is 0.64 on the logit scale.
The patient-level estimate of the monitoring effect is
20.04 on the logit scale with a two-sided 95% confi-
dence interval (20.40; 0.33). Figure 2 shows the forest
plot of a random-effect meta-analysis of within-trial
monitoring effects estimated with logistic regression
with site as random effect accounting for clustering.
There is no significant heterogeneity between trials (esti-
mated heterogeneity variance: 0.05, p = 0.32). Note
that trial #05 is statistically non-informative because
there were major findings in all but one patient. The
intervention effect does not differ by risk class. The
overall estimate of the random-effect meta-analysis
closely agrees with the model-based estimate.
Corresponding figures for the error domain­specific
finding rates can be found in the supplement Figures
S3­S7. Again, random-effect meta-analysis is consistent
with the model-based estimates. Figure 3 illustrates
model-based estimates of the monitoring effect for the
primary patient-level and the secondary error domain­
specific finding rates.
There is no statistical evidence that type of monitor-
ing makes any difference in reducing the number of
major audit findings either overall or in specific error
domains. Quantitatively, point estimates lie near zero
on the logit scale, and all two-sided 95% confidence
intervals clearly exclude the pre-specified tolerance limit
of logit + 0.6. Thus, non-inferiority is shown.
Description of audit findings by error domains
We performed a detailed explorative analysis of all
2456 findings, which will be published separately. The
most frequent types of findings by error domain are as
follows.
Findings in the informed consent process (N = 292)
mainly concerned dating the signature by the participat-
ing patient (missing, delayed or not written by patient;
N = 180). Another problem was information being
provided by staff not qualified for this task (N = 38).
We did not find positive evidence that any audited
patient entered a trial without being aware of his/her
trial participation.
With regard to patient selection (N = 436), mea-
surements required for the assessment of eligibility were
not performed, not performed in a timely manner or
were out of range in 175 cases. In total, 89 findings
concerned violation of complicated rules on prohibited
co-medication mainly in one of the trials. In 71 cases,
included patients either did not belong to the targeted
Figure 2. Monitoring effect on the primary endpoint. Figure 2 shows the forest plot of a random-effect meta-analysis of within-trial
monitoring effects. The overall estimate of the random-effect meta-analysis closely agrees with the model-based estimate of 20.04
with two-sided 95% confidence interval (20.40; 0.33). There is no significant heterogeneity between trials. Note that trial #05 is
non-informative because there were major findings in all but one patient. Trials are grouped by risk class. The intervention effect
does not differ by risk class. The black vertical line at 0.6 shows the pre-specified tolerance margin for claiming non-inferiority.
Overall and in both subgroups, the non-inferiority margin is outside the meta-analysis confidence interval (CI).

trial population to which the trial question applied
(N = 18) or compliance with eligibility criteria was not
fully verifiable.
Findings in intervention (N = 758) mainly con-
cerned treatment modification rules in complex treat-
ment schemes: In 227 findings, a treatment
modification rule was ignored, and in further 166, a
modification rule trigger (e.g. blood counts before start
of next therapy cycle) was not measured or not mea-
sured in a timely manner. In all, 90 relevant dose devia-
tions were noted.
A total of 629 findings concerned endpoint assess-
ments: an endpoint was not assessed in 95 cases, mea-
sured inadequately in 181 cases and not on schedule in
68 cases.
In serious adverse event reporting (N = 356 find-
ings), the most frequent finding was non-reporting of a
serious adverse event (N = 73) or reporting with delay
(N = 217). Among these 290 cases where a serious
adverse event was not reported or reported with delay,
a proportion of 18% (23/128) of serious adverse events
were not reported in extensive on-site monitoring com-
pared to 31% (50/162) with risk-adapted monitoring.
Monitoring findings
Monitoring reported findings in 465 of 755 (61.6%)
patients with extensive on-site monitoring and 287 of
863 (33.3%) patients with risk-adapted monitoring.
This difference is expected since risk-adapted monitor-
ing required only a sample of patients to be monitored.
Finding rates per patient calculated for patients actually
monitored in all error domains were comparable (456
of 735 (62.0%) patients with extensive on-site monitor-
ing and 196 of 306 (64.1%) patients with risk-adapted
monitoring). This also applies to each error domain
(see Figure S8 supplement for a model-based analysis).
Monitoring findings in relation to subsequent audit
findings
The purpose of this section is to report on the quality of
monitoring (rate of audit findings not already detected
by monitoring) and the degree of remedy of findings
through monitoring (rate of monitoring findings not
mentioned again by auditors). The informed consent
process was both monitored and audited in 1402 cases.
Audit and monitoring agreed on `no finding' in 894 and
on `finding' in 134 cases, resulting in a concordance rate
of 73.3% (extensive on-site monitoring: 73.6%; risk-
adapted monitoring: 73.0%). For details, see supple-
ment Table S1. In 76 cases, the audit detected a finding
not reported by monitoring (7.8% of all 970 cases with-
out monitoring findings; extensive on-site monitoring:
7.0%; risk-adapted monitoring: 8.7%). Of 432 monitor-
ing findings, 298 (69.0%; extensive on-site monitoring:
65.5%; risk-adapted monitoring: 73.8%) were not
reported any more as audit findings, due to monitoring
follow-up actions.
Discussion
ADAMON compared two monitoring strategies: exten-
sive standard on-site monitoring with complete source

data verification and less frequent risk-adapted on-site
monitoring focussing on key data and trial-specific
risks.
The primary endpoint was the number of patients
with at least one major or critical violation of GCP
objectives as determined by standardised ADAMON
post-trial audits. This endpoint was chosen to deter-
mine whether the nature and amount of monitoring
influence the number of GCP violations that occur in a
trial and are not remedied by monitoring.
ADAMON shows that risk-adapted monitoring is
non-inferior to extensive monitoring, although it
required less than 50% of the monitoring resources.
As trials differed in complexity and therefore overall
finding rate, the primary analysis is based on the logit
scale. The tolerance margin for the difference in audit
finding rates was pre-specified as 0.6 on the logit scale.
The estimate of the monitoring effect in the primary
endpoint is 20.04 on the logit scale with two-sided
95% confidence interval (20.40; 0.33). For illustration,
Figure S9 (supplement) translates logit differences into
easier to interpret finding rate differences depending on
an assumed overall finding rate with extensive monitor-
ing. Observed finding rates varied between 18% and
99%. Possible benefit with extensive monitoring not
excluded by the conditional 95% confidence intervals is
1.8%, 3.4% and 5.8% for assumed finding rates of 5%,
10% and 20%, respectively. The maximum of 8.2% is
attained with finding rates of about 50%. Thus, if there
was a benefit from extensive monitoring, the effect
would remain small compared to the overall finding
rates.
ADAMON only audited 82% of all patients audita-
ble (77.6% with extensive and 86.7% with risk-adapted
monitoring). We do not think that this deviation
induces bias, since the reasons for not auditing fol-
lowed the same rules in both arms: We were not able to
audit 30 trial sites with less than 3 patients (47 patients
in total) due to logistic and financial constraints. In
very large trial sites, a random sample of patients was
audited, in order to limit auditing to a maximum of
5 days.
The main purpose of monitoring is to help protect-
ing rights and well-being of trial participants and mak-
ing sure that data are accurate, complete and verifiable
from source documents.5 Audit findings address these
aspects. A secondary objective of monitoring is describ-
ing the adherence to GCP and trial rules. Without
audit results, knowledge about GCP violations in the
trials would clearly depend on the results of monitoring
visits only and thus on the monitoring strategy. The
absolute number of reported monitoring findings was
higher with extensive on-site monitoring than with risk-
adapted monitoring, simply because with risk-adapted
monitoring only a sample of patients and source data is
monitored. But the finding rates per monitored patient
were almost identical. This suggests that risk-adapted
monitoring provides a representative sample of findings
from a sample of patients monitored and thus should
be sufficient for the assessment of overall trial protocol
compliance and detection of systematic problems in
trial conduct, thus allowing the trial sponsor to imple-
ment adequate corrective and preventive measures to
improve the trial's quality.
We found some evidence of remedy of GCP viola-
tions by monitoring, namely, in informed consent and
in a shift from serious adverse event not reported to
serious adverse event reported with delay. But remark-
ably, there was no evidence of an actually preventive
effect of monitoring on the occurrence of GCP viola-
tions by either monitoring strategy. In particular, there
was no consistent trend of less findings in later patients
within a trial site (data not shown).
The observed finding rates were surprisingly high
(18%­99%). In designing ADAMON, we had assumed
a finding rate of about 5%­10% based on a review
available at that time.8 Finding rates per patient have
rarely been reported in a systematic way. ADAMON
fills this information gap.
In setting up audit manuals, our aim was to define
findings with impact on patient safety and rights and
validity of trial results including existence of source
data for important trial items. We used strict defini-
tions in ADAMON audit manuals to reduce variance
in finding assessment by the auditors. In specifying
which deviation from a given rule was to be recorded
as a finding, we relied on the wording of trial rules in
the respective trial protocols applying rather liberal tol-
erance limits. Some of the findings can be regarded as a
violation of detailed GCP requirements or the wording
of a study rule, but not necessarily as a breach of the
underlying objective. A detailed attempt to classify
ADAMON findings accordingly will be published
separately.
In developing the audit manuals from the trial pro-
tocols, we were confronted with trial rules and require-
ments that appeared unnecessarily complex and
sometimes ambiguous. Trial protocols also tended to
be overly specific causing avoidable friction with local
clinical practice. These shortcomings clearly contribu-
ted to the high finding rates.
The nature, extent and suspected root causes of the
ADAMON audit findings imply that the majority of
the GCP violations cannot be retrospectively remedied
or prospectively prevented by simple source data verifi-
cation and subsequent generation of queries. More
attention to potential problems would have to be paid
while developing the trial protocol and case report
forms.
ADAMON had no influence on the quality of design
or control of the extent of trial oversight and intensity
of central monitoring in the participating trials. Recent
recommendations1,2,17­21 concerning trial oversight
Brosteanu et al. 593
were not available at the time when ADAMON trials
started.
ADAMON did not interfere with escalation of and
reaction to monitoring findings. Monitoring reports
indicate that in some trials, reactions to monitoring
findings were unassertive such that systematic problems
were not adequately addressed.
ADAMON focussed on academic investigator­
initiated trials. We nevertheless hypothesise that results
are generalisable beyond academic trials, because error-
prone trial rules and error-prone complex clinical set-
tings are not restricted to investigator-initiated trials.
This is also supported by publicly available summaries
of inspectional observations of the US Food and Drug
Administration and the European Medicines
Agency.22,23
Central statistical monitoring has the potential to
detect a considerable proportion of findings without
on-site monitoring.24,25 ADAMON was not designed
to assess how much central statistical monitoring can
complement or partly substitute on-site monitoring. In
particular, we have not shown that on-site monitoring
can be safely omitted.
ADAMON was also not designed to investigate the
overall impact of the findings on the reliability of the
results of the participating trials. Eight of the trials
have been already published, mostly in major journals.
Several publications suggest that reliable results can be
generated in real-world settings in large trials as long as
randomisation and avoidance of systematic bias is
guaranteed.4,3,26 Two publications27,28 suggest that
data corrections triggered by source data verification
only minimally affect trial outcomes.
To our knowledge, ADAMON is the first fully pub-
lished trial comparing effectiveness of monitoring stra-
tegies;29­31 three related studies (OPTI-misation of
MONitoring (OPTIMON), Strategic Timing of
AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) trial Monitoring
Substudy and TargetEd Monitoring: Prospective
Evaluation and Refinement (TEMPER) study) ­ with
different foci and designs ­ will become available in the
future. The French OPTIMON study compares the
efficacy of two monitoring strategies: one based on the
classic standards of quality assurance and the other one
based on the risk level (OPTIMON scale) with pre-
definition of scientific and regulatory priorities. The
study involves clinical research studies with risk level
A, B or C (low to intermediate risk) in the OPTIMON
scale.32 The START monitoring sub-study is part of an
international HIV treatment trial. In START, all sites
are centrally monitored and are required to perform
local quality assurance activities according to a local
monitoring plan. In addition, sites are randomised to
receive, or not receive, annual on-site monitoring.33
Finally, the Targeted Monitoring, Prospective
Evaluation and Refinement (TEMPER) study
investigates the efficacy of central monitoring in com-
bination with targeted for-cause on-site monitoring.
Problematic sites identified by central monitoring are
paired with similarly sized inconspicuous sites. Both
are monitored on-site. Finding rates are compared
using a matched pair design.34
Since the design of ADAMON in 2007, the interna-
tional discussion has moved towards prospective qual-
ity by design measures for both the scientific and the
operational design of clinical trials and towards the
combination of risk-based on-site monitoring with cen-
tral statistical monitoring.1­3,17 ADAMON results pro-
vide basic empirical evidence to support this new
paradigm, which was scarce up to now.
In conclusion, ADAMON has shown that risk-
adapted monitoring is non-inferior to extensive moni-
toring in avoiding violations of GCP objectives as
detected in post-trial audits, although it required less
than 50% in monitoring resources. Extensive on-site
monitoring compared to risk-adapted monitoring may
improve the sponsor's knowledge about what went
wrong in a trial, but does not reduce the number of
major or critical GCP violations that occur.
ADAMON results suggest that progress in reducing
frequency of GCP violations requires improved quality
of trial protocols and comprehensive quality manage-
ment based on a careful analysis of inherent risks for
patients' safety and rights as well as reliability of trial
results.
