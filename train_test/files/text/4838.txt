Education as an Antidote to Cynicism:
A Longitudinal Investigation
Olga Stavrova1 and Daniel Ehlebracht2
Abstract
Although cynical beliefs about human nature yield numerous adverse consequences for individuals' life outcomes and well-being,
very little is known about factors that counteract the development of cynical beliefs. Drawing from the literature on the
"education effect" describing the importance of education in overcoming close-mindedness and negative views of others, we
propose that education can represent an antidote to cynicism. The results of two large-scale longitudinal studies showed that
education was associated with lower levels of cynicism over time spans of 4 and 9 years. Longitudinal mediation analyses
underscored the role of individual differences in perceived constraints, a facet of personal control, as the psychological mechanism
underlying the education effect: Higher education is associated with a reduced perception of constraints, which is in turn related
to less endorsement of cynical beliefs.

cynical beliefs about human nature, educational attainment, personal control
Psychologists and social scientists alike have long been
interested in lay beliefs about human nature (Kluckhohn,
1950; Rosenberg, 1956; Wrightsman, 1964, 1992). Are people
inherently corrupt, deceptive, and motivated exclusively by
self-interest or are they honest, trustworthy, and genuinely con-
cerned about others' well-being? Research shows that individ-
uals differ widely in their answers to these questions and,
consequently, whether they endorse an idealist or a cynical
view of human nature (Bond et al., 2004; Cook & Medley,
1954; Leung et al., 2002; Wrightsman, 1964). Following recent
research (Chen et al., 2016; Stavrova & Ehlebracht, 2016), we
define cynical beliefs about human nature (briefly referred to as
cynicism) as a dispositional construct reflecting individual dif-
ferences in core evaluations of human nature as good or evil.
Cynical beliefs involve a negative appraisal of other people's
intentions and motives and a tendency to view most people
with suspicion and distrust.
Cynical beliefs about human nature have been shown to
have negative consequences for a wide range of individuals'
life outcomes. Cynicism has been found to be one of the most
important predictors of bad health, including increased likeli-
hood of coronary heart disease, dementia, depression, and risk
of mortality (Everson et al., 1997; Neuvonen et al., 2014;
Smith, 1992). Negative consequences of holding cynical
beliefs extend to interpersonal relationships (Baron et al.,
2007; Kaplan, Bradley, & Ruscher, 2004), self-esteem, subjec-
tive well-being (Chen et al., 2015), job satisfaction (Leung, Ip,
& Leung, 2010), and career success (Stavrova & Ehlebracht,
2016). Cynicism is also thought of as a source of negative
outcomes for whole societies, hindering national economic
growth, undermining democracy and civic engagement, and
providing fertile soil for crime and corruption (Knack & Kee-
fer, 1997; Putnam, 2000; Rothstein & Uslaner, 2005; Uslaner
& Brown, 2005).
Despite cynicism's deleterious consequences, very little is
known about factors that prevent its development. Herein, we
explore the role of educational attainment as an antidote to
cynicism. Existing literature has promoted the idea of educa-
tion as a means against close-mindedness, intolerance, and dis-
trust of the differently minded (Coenders & Scheepers, 2003;
Osborne & Sibley, 2015). In particular, education endows indi-
viduals with a sense of personal control (Lewis, Ross, & Mir-
owsky, 1999) and therefore might help them overcome
feelings of vulnerability and suspiciousness. Although a mod-
erate negative correlation between cynicism and education has
been repeatedly reported in the literature (Carroll, Smith, Shef-
field, Shipley, & Marmot, 1997; Gallo & Matthews, 2003;
Stavrova & Ehlebracht, 2016), it remains to be investigated

whether education is related to the development of cynical
beliefs in the long run.
Theoretical Background
Education is often seen as an important factor promoting open-
mindedness and tolerance. Highly educated individuals tend to
score higher on measures of openness to experience (O'Con-
nell & Sheikh, 2011; Van Eijck & De Graaf, 2004), are more
likely to support minorities' rights, and are less likely to
endorse prejudice and out-group stereotypes (Coenders &
Scheepers, 2003; Fingerhut, 2011; Huang, den Brink, & Groot,
2011; Jenssen & Engesbak, 1994; Kuppens & Spears, 2014;
Osborne & Sibley, 2015). Education provides individuals with
better access to status and power and thus might diminish the
perception of vulnerability to others' potentially malicious
intentions. In addition, by developing cognitive skills, educa-
tion can help individuals build a stronger sense of mastery and
control over their lives (Schneeweis, Skirbekk, & Winter-
Ebmer, 2014). Indeed, an increased perception of personal con-
trol represents one of the most important psychological
consequences of education reported in the literature (Eshbaugh,
2009; Lewis et al., 1999; Schieman, 2001; Schieman & Plick-
ert, 2008; Specht, Egloff, & Schmukle, 2013).
Personal control is widely recognized as a valuable personal
resource, strengthening individuals' coping ability, subjective
well-being, and health (Lachman, 2006; Rotter, 1966; Turiano,
Chapman, Agrigoroaei, Infurna, & Lachman, 2014). Individu-
als with a strong sense of control tend to believe that they hold
power over what happens to them and how their life unfolds,
whereas individuals with a weak sense of control tend to feel
powerless and believe that their life depends much on factors
beyond their control, such as chance, fate, or other people (Ross
& Sastry, 1999; Rotter, 1966; Skinner, 1996). Personal control
is believed to include two facets--mastery and perceived con-
straints (Lachman & Weaver, 1998). Mastery refers to a belief
in one's ability to achieve the desired outcomes, whereas per-
ceived constraints describe a belief in one's dependence on
factors beyond one's control (e.g., other people) in achieving
the desired outcomes. In existing research, these facets of
personal control are often combined into one scale, although
in a couple of recent studies, they were analyzed separately
(cf. Infurna & Mayer, 2015; Ward, 2013). Herein, we assume
that a stronger sense of control (higher mastery and/or lower
constraints) might help overcome feelings of vulnerability
and thus reduce the use of self-protective strategies, such as
suspiciousness, hostility, and distrust, which are central to
cynicism (Pope, Smith, & Rhodewalt, 1990; Vranceanu,
Gallo, & Bogart, 2006). Indeed, prior research has shown that
feeling powerless and at others' mercy amplifies suspicion
and distrust (Ross, 2011).
In the present research, we propose that educational attain-
ment endows individuals with a stronger sense of personal con-
trol and therefore represents an antidote to the development of
cynicism. We also investigate whether obtaining a higher level
of education is associated with less cynicism even if one got off
to a bad start in life. Existing research suggests that economic
hardship in childhood promotes the development of cynicism
in adulthood (Lynch, Kaplan, & Shema, 1997). In fact, individ-
uals raised in low socioeconomic status (SES) households are
less likely to show high educational attainment. Therefore,
we investigated whether obtaining a high level of education
is associated with less cynicism in adulthood regardless of
one's starting conditions.
We explored these questions using a longitudinal methodol-
ogy. In Study 1, we examined the role of individual differences
in educational attainment in the endorsement of cynical beliefs
using a two-wave longitudinal study of the American popula-
tion. In Study 2, we replicated these findings in another long-
itudinal sample and explored the role of personal control as a
potential mediator of the education effect. As differences in
education are related to sociodemographic and economic char-
acteristics, such as race or income, we included these variables
as well as basic sociodemographic controls (gender and age) in
the analyses in both studies.
Study 1
Method
We used the data from the American Changing Lives Study
(House, 2014), a longitudinal study of the American population
that started in 1986 and sampled about 3,000 individuals aged
25 and older. As cynicism was measured in Waves 4 (2002)
and 5 (2011) only, we included only the data from these two
waves. The final sample consisted of 1,087 individuals (mean
age ¼ 56.65, 39%1 male). Data and materials can be accessed
at the study's website (House, 2014).
Cynicism
Cynicism was measured with 3 items of the Cook­Medley
Cynical Distrust Scale (as only 3 items were included in both
waves; Greenglass & Julkunen, 1989): "Most people
inwardly dislike putting themselves out to help other people,"
"Most people will use somewhat unfair means to gain profit
or an advantage rather than lose it," and "I think most people
would lie in order to get ahead" (4-point agree­disagree
scale; Cronbach's a ¼ .71 at baseline and .72 at follow-up,
respectively).
Education
Participants were asked to report the number of years of educa-
tion they had when joining the panel in 1986 (ranging from 0 to
17). As the sample included individuals aged 25 and older and
the maximum number of years possible was 17, most respon-
dents would have been able to attain the maximum level of edu-
cation by the time of joining the panel (assuming that primary
education for most people in the United States starts at the age
of 6­7 years).
60 Social Psychological and Personality Science 9(1)
Control variables included age, gender (1 ¼ male,
0 ¼ female), race (1 ¼ Caucasian, 0 ¼ Other), and
log-transformed income at Time 1 (t1; own and spouse's
joint income before taxes, in U.S. dollars, adjusted for the
presence of a spouse. If the income value referred to the joint
own and spouse's income, it was divided by 2.).
Results and Discussion
Means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations among
the variables are shown in Table 1. Educational attainment was
negatively correlated with cynicism in both waves (r ¼ À.22 at
t1 and r ¼ À.18 at Time 2 [t2], p < .001).
To better account for measurement error in cynicism, we
conducted a series of structural equation models (SEMs) mod-
eling cynicism at t1 and t2 as latent constructs. We used the
lavaan package of R (version 3.3.1; Rosseel, 2012). We report
model-based parameter estimates along with their p values. As
estimates of effect sizes, we additionally report the respective
partial correlations and their 95% confidence intervals [CIs].
To evaluate model fit, we used comparative fit index (CFI !
.90), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA
.08), and standardized root mean square residuals (SRMR
.08; Hu & Bentler, 1999; Marsh, Hau, & Grayson, 2005).
First, we assessed the measurement model by letting the
three indicators of cynicism at t1 and t2 load on their respec-
tive latent constructs (that were allowed to correlate with
each other). The model included longitudinal correlations
between the same items measured at t1 and t2 (Cole & Max-
well, 2003). The model yielded a very good fit, w2(5) ¼
20.77, p ¼ .001, CFI ¼ .99, RMSEA ¼ .05, SRMR ¼ .02.
Second, we tested the measurement invariance of cynicism
over time by comparing the model with free factor loadings
to the constrained model in which factor loadings of the same
items were fixed to be equal over time. The constrained
model showed a good fit as well and did not significantly dif-
fer from the model with free factor loadings, w2(2) ¼ 1.25,
p ¼ .54 (for fit indices, see Supplemental Table S1), provid-
ing evidence for metric invariance of cynicism between t1
and t2 (Little, Preacher, Selig, & Card, 2007).
To examine the longitudinal effect of education on cynicism,
we fitted an SEM in which cynicism at t2 was predicted by edu-
cation and cynicism at t1 (Model 1, Table 2). Cynicism as t1 and
t2 were modeled as latent factors. The model fits the data reason-
ably well, w2(10) ¼ 93.27, p < .001, CFI ¼ .95, RMSEA ¼ .088,
SRMR ¼ .06. Educational attainment negatively predicted cyni-
cism at t2 when controlling for cynicism at t1 (b ¼ À.01, p ¼
.046, partial r ¼ À.10, 95% CI [À.16, À.04]).2 In Model 2, to
examine whether the effect of education on cynicism holds when

controlling for basic sociodemographic and economic character-
istics, we additionally modeled age, gender, race, and income at
t1 as predictors of cynicism at t2. This model showed a substan-
tially worse fit, w2(30) ¼ 258.05, p < .001, CFI ¼ .88, RMSEA
¼ .08, SRMR ¼ .08. Most importantly though, it showed that the
effect of education was robust against controlling for these
sociodemographic and economic indicators (b ¼ À.02, p ¼
.031, partial r ¼ À.08, 95% CI [À.14, À.02]).
The results of Study 1 showed that educational attainment
predicted a decreasing endorsement of cynicism over time. This
effect was independent of participants' sociodemographic char-
acteristics, such as age or race, and their income, suggesting that
a lack of education rather than economic disadvantage contri-
butes to cynicism. However, experiencing economic hardship
already in childhood might be more important for the develop-
ment of cynicism than economic conditions later in adulthood
(Lynch et al., 1997). Growing up in a financially disadvantaged
household, in an underprivileged, dangerous environment might
evoke a mind-set of suspiciousness and feelings of vulnerability
and have a formative influence on individuals' psychological
development. Importantly, as childhood economic hardship is
associated with lower educational attainment (Breen & Jonsson,
2005), it might represent a potential confounding in our analyses.
In other words, could the negative effect of education demon-
strated in Study 1 be explained by a confounding with childhood
economic disadvantage? Or might obtaining a higher level of
education inhibit the development of cynicism even if one got
off to a bad start in life? To shed light on this question, in Study
2, we additionally took into account individual differences in
childhood SES.
Importantly, we examined the proposed psychological
mechanism of the education effect. Using a longitudinal med-
iation methodology (Cole & Maxwell, 2003; Preacher, 2015),
we tested the role of personal control as a potential mediator
of the effect of education on cynicism development.
Study 2
Method
For this study, we used the data from the Health and Retirement
Study, an American nationally representative longitudinal sur-
vey of adults aged 50 and older and their spouses (Health and
Retirement Study, 2012). Participants have been surveyed
every 2 years since 1992. A measure of cynicism was first
added to the survey in 2006 (for one half of the sample) and
in 2008 (for the other half). These two subsamples were com-
bined as our baseline assessment. The follow-up assessment
was conducted in 2010 (for the 2006 subsample) and in 2012
(for the 2008 subsample), resulting in a 4-year time lag
between the baseline and the follow-up for all participants. The
final sample consisted of 10,072 (mean age 67.48, 40.1% male)
individuals. Data and materials can be accessed at the study's
website (Health and Retirement Study, 2012).
We used the information about participants' level of
educational attainment (1 ¼ lower than high school,
2 ¼ generational educational development degree, 3 ¼ high
school diploma, 4 ¼ some college, and 5 ¼ college and above),
which was collected when they joined the panel.
Cynical beliefs about human nature were measured with a
5-item version of the Cook­Medley Cynical Distrust Scale
(Cook & Medley, 1954; Everson et al., 1997). Additional items
to the ones used in Study 1 are: "No one cares much what hap-
pens to you" and "I commonly wonder what hidden reasons
another person may have for doing something nice for me"
(1 ¼ strongly disagree to 6 ¼ strongly agree; Cronbach's
a ¼ .80 at baseline and .79 at follow-up).
The measure of personal control consisted of two 5-item
subscales: mastery (sample item "Whether or not I am able
to get what I want is in my own hands"; Cronbach's a ¼ .90
at t1 and .90 at t2) and perceived constraints (sample items
"Other people determine most of what I can and cannot do";
Cronbach's a ¼ .86 at t1 and .88 at t2; Lachman & Weaver,
1998). Responses were given on a 6-point agree­disagree
scale. The two-factorial structure was confirmed in a confirma-
tory factor analysis that modeled mastery and constraints at t1
and t2 as four latent correlated factors, w2(154) ¼ 6899.71, p <
.001, CFI ¼ .94, RMSEA ¼ .07, SRMR ¼ .03.3
Participants provided information on the level of their
father's and mother's education (number of years in education,
ranging from 0 to 17) and their family's financial situation
during their childhood (between birth and age 16; 1 ¼ poor,
2 ¼ about average, 3 ¼ pretty well off financially). Partici-
pants' responses to these questions were standardized and com-
bined into a measure of childhood SES (Cronbach's a ¼ .68).
As in Study1, the analyses included participants' age, gen-
der (1 ¼ male, 0 ¼ female), race (1 ¼ Caucasian, 0 ¼ Other),
and log-transformed income at t1 (total annual household
income in dollars).
Results and Discussion
As this study included four latent constructs (cynicism, mas-
tery, constraints, and childhood SES), we started by examining
a measurement model in which manifest variables were
allowed to load on their respective latent factors and the latent
factors were allowed to correlate with each other (Cole &
Maxwell, 2003). This model reached an acceptable fit,
w2(459) ¼ 10,549.69, p < .001, CFI ¼ .94, RMSEA ¼ .05,
SRMR ¼ .04, suggesting that the manifest variables reflect the
underlying constructs they are supposed to measure.
We then proceeded to testing measurement invariance of
cynicism, mastery, and constraints over time. We used the
same procedure as in Study 1. Models with free and constrained
loadings showed good fit (see Supplemental Table S1). A look
at incremental fit indices shows that putting constraints on fac-
tor loadings did not deteriorate model fit.4 Therefore, we con-
cluded that cynicism, mastery, and constraints items reached
the level of metric invariance between t1 and t2.
Means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations
among the variables are shown in Table 3. Replicating the find-
ings of Study 1, educational attainment was negatively
62 Social Psychological and Personality Science 9(1)
associated with cynicism at both baseline (r ¼ À.24, p < .001)
and follow-up (r ¼ À.23, p < .001).
To explore the longitudinal effect of education on cynicism,
we specified an SEM in which cynicism at t2 was predicted by
education and cynicism at t1 (Model 1, Table 4). Cynicism at t1
and t2 were modeled as latent constructs. The model reached a
satisfactory fit, w2(38) ¼ 2,457.93, p < .001, CFI ¼ .93,
RMSEA ¼ .08, SRMR ¼ .07. Like in Study 1, education nega-
tively predicted cynicism at t2 when controlling for cynicism at
t1 (b ¼ À.09, p < .001, partial r ¼ À.12, 95% CI [À.14, À.10]).
In Model 2, we added age, gender, race, income at t1, and
childhood SES as predictors of cynicism at t2. The fit of this
model was rather poor, w2(117) ¼ 6,419.45, p < .001, CFI ¼
.86, RMSEA ¼ .07, SRMR ¼ .09. The effect of education
remained significant, although it decreased compared to the
model without controls (b ¼ À.06, p < .001, partial r ¼
À.07, 95% CI [À.09, À.05]). Additionally, to examine whether
the effect of education varied depending on childhood SES, we
computed an interaction effect between education and child-
hood SES, that did not reach significance (b ¼ À.005, p ¼
.56). Hence, obtaining a higher level of education is associated
with less cynicism irrespective of childhood SES.
Mediation Analyses
A look at zero-order correlations shows that highly educated
individuals were more likely to report a strong sense of mastery
(r ¼ .08, p < .001 at t1 and r ¼ .11, p < .001 at t2) and a weak
sense of constraints (r ¼ À.22, p < .001 at t1 and r ¼ À.21,
p < .001 at t2). In turn, mastery was negatively associated with
cynicism (r ¼ À.12, p < .001 at t1 and r ¼ À.14, p < .001 at
t2), whereas constraints were positively associated with
cynicism (r ¼ .35, p < .001 at t1 and r ¼ .34, p < .001 at t2).
To examine whether the effect of education on cynicism is
mediated by mastery and constraints, we conducted a longitu-
dinal mediation analysis. We followed the recommendations
by Cole and Maxwell (2003) and Preacher (2015) for two-
wave longitudinal data. Their approach involves estimating the
longitudinal effect of the independent variable on the mediator
(Path a) and the longitudinal effect of the mediator on the
dependent variable (Path b). The indirect effect is computed
by multiplying Path a by Path b. Although using this approach
we cannot determine what share of the total effect is accounted
for by the mediator, the estimation of the indirect effect is
based on longitudinal tests, making this approach the best pos-
sible way to test the underlying relations using nonexperimen-
tal methods (Cole & Maxwell, 2003).
The mediation was tested using SEM (see Figure 1). The
effects of mastery and constraints were tested simultaneously.
The model reached an acceptable fit, w2(407) ¼ 11,929.29, p
< .001, CFI ¼ .93, RMSEA ¼ .05, SRMR ¼ .07. Educational
attainment was positively associated with mastery at t2
(b ¼ .07, p < .001, partial r ¼ .09, 95% CI [.07, .10]) and nega-
tively associated with constraints at t2 (b ¼ À.04, p < .001, par-
tial r ¼ À.11, 95% CI [À.13, À.09]), even when controlling for
mastery and constraints at baseline, respectively. However,

and was not significant (95% CI [À.002, .001]). The indirect
effect via constraints reached À.006 and was significant
(95% CI [À.008, À.003]). We repeated these analyses includ-
ing age, gender, race, income at t1, and childhood SES as addi-
tional predictors of all endogenous variables (Figure 2). These
analyses showed nearly identical results (see Table 5 and Fig-
ure 2), highlighting the role of constraints rather than mastery
as a mediator of the effect of education on cynicism.
Overall, Study 2 replicated the prospective effect of educa-
tion on cynicism, demonstrated in Study 1. In addition, it
extended the results of Study 1 in two important ways. First,
we have shown the education effect to operate regardless of
individual differences in childhood SES, suggesting that higher
educational attainment appears to undermine the development
of cynicism even among individuals who grew up in precarious
socioeconomic conditions. Second, using a longitudinal media-
tion analysis, we shed some light on the psychological mechan-
ism behind this effect: Our results suggest that education is
associated with a lower sense of perceived constraints, which
might help averting feelings of vulnerability to others and thus
undermine cynicism development.
General Discussion
Cynicism is a common social phenomenon bearing deleterious
consequences for individuals (Chen et al., 2015; Critcher &
Dunning, 2011; Smith, 1992; Stavrova & Ehlebracht, 2016)
and societies (Knack & Keefer, 1997; Putnam, 2000). Despite
its ubiquity, factors contributing to and undermining the devel-
opment of cynicism have been poorly understood so far. In the
present research, we explored the role of educational attain-
ment in cynicism development. The results of two large-scale
longitudinal studies showed that high educational attainment

predicted lower levels of cynicism over time, acting as a sort of
antidote to cynicism. We detected this effect in two different
large adult samples that were followed over 9 (Study 1) and
4 (Study 2) years. High educational attainment was associated
with less cynicism regardless of individuals' sociodemographic
characteristics, including income, as well as their childhood
SES. That is, obtaining a higher level of education acted as
an antidote to cynical beliefs about human nature even among
individuals who had a difficult start in life.
How exactly can education contribute to less cynicism?
Drawing on existing literature on the link between education
and personal control and the potential of personal control to
dampen unwarranted suspiciousness and feelings of vulnerabil-
ity, we proposed that a sense of control can represent the psy-
chological mechanism underlying the education effect.
Following prior research (Lachman & Weaver, 1998), we dif-
ferentiated between mastery, a belief in one's ability to achieve
the desired outcomes, and perceived constraints, a belief that
external factors, such as other people or just bad luck interfere
with achieving the desired outcomes. The results of the longi-
tudinal mediation analyses (Study 2) indicated that only per-
ceived constraints (but not mastery) acted as a mediator of
the effect of education on cynicism. While higher education
was associated with both a stronger perception of mastery and
a weaker perception of constraints, only the latter was related to
less cynicism. Perception of constraints involves a belief that
one's life is determined by external factors, including other
people, and may thus give rise to a feeling of vulnerability.
In turn, feeling vulnerable and at other people's mercy are cen-
tral to suspiciousness and cynical distrust (Pope et al., 1990;
Ross, 2011; Vranceanu et al., 2006). These findings are gener-
ally consistent with recent research showing that mastery and
constraints might have different associations with life out-
comes (Infurna & Mayer, 2015; Ward, 2013).

Although here we have shown education to reduce cyni-
cism via its positive influence on perceived constraints, it still
remains to be explored how exactly this effect operates. For
example, highly educated individuals might have different
social experiences compared to their less educated counter-
parts. High educational attainment might reduce the likeli-
hood of becoming victim to deception and exploitation and
consequently counteract the perception of the social world
as a hostile place. In fact, existing research suggests that a
hostile childhood environment contributes to cynicism devel-
opment (Meesters, Muris, & Esselink, 1995). Hence, one
potentially interesting avenue for future research is to exam-
ine to what extent the education effect demonstrated here rests
on individual differences in the exposure to others' malevo-
lence or kindness.
On a related note, education might provide individuals not
only with a higher perceived control of their own lives but also
with more power over others (e.g., as it can provide access to
high-power positions). While we showed that perceived control
over one's own life is associated with less cynicism, power
(i.e., control over others) might have the opposite effect. Stud-
ies have shown power to undermine perspective taking,
increase social distance (Blader et al., 2016; Lammers,
Galinsky, Gordijn, & Otten, 2012), and render individuals
more sensitive to unfairness against the self (Sawaoka, Hughes,
& Ambady, 2015). Most importantly, power gives one reason
to doubt the purity of the intentions behind others' kindness and
thus facilitates cynical attributions for others' generous beha-
vior (Inesi, Gruenfeld, & Galinsky, 2012). It might be interest-
ing to future studies to explore whether holding a position of
power can fuel the development of cynicism.
The present research is not without limitations. We
acknowledge that both studies are based on only two waves
of data, which limits our ability to examine individual trajec-
tories of cynicism development over time as a function of
their education (Singer & Willett, 2003). Another design lim-
itation is that the information about participants' education
was collected years before their cynicism was measured for
the first time. Yet, given that we were interested in formal
education which is typically completed by the age of 25­30
(National Center of Education Statistics, 2016) and both our
samples were rather old (mean age over 50), we believe
potential unrecorded changes in formal education throughout
this time to be rather unlikely. At the same time, besides for-
mal education, individuals might educate themselves inde-
pendently of any formal institution (and highly educated
individuals might be more likely to commit to lifelong learn-
ing). Such individual efforts might serve as a more proximal
mechanism of the effect of formal education reported here and
is worth further investigations.
Despite the longitudinal design of the current studies, sug-
gesting that education leads to less cynicism, the reverse path
of causality is possible as well. Dispositional cynicism might
make one suspicious not only regarding strangers' intentions,
it might also impair one's openness to new experiences, includ-
ing willingness to absorb new information, openness to new
ideas, and divergent thinking, which might undermine one's
academic achievement. We could not explore this possibility
in the present study, as the majority of respondents were in late
adulthood and the studies included a measure of education at
just one time point. We encourage future studies to use samples
of children and adolescents to examine the potential effect of
cynical worldviews on educational attainment.
In a similar vein, although the longitudinal mediation used
here represents a methodological improvement over widely
used cross-sectional mediation designs (Cole & Maxwell,
2003), it does not allow making strong causal inferences either
(Bullock, Green, & Ha, 2010) and might be even confused with
mathematically equivalent phenomena, such as confounding
(MacKinnon, Krull, & Lockwood, 2000). Although causal
inferences regarding the effect of education are difficult,
researchers can still explore the causal assumptions behind the
role of control in cynicism development. For example, manip-
ulating perceived constraints (e.g., see Stavrova & Meckel,
2017) to examine their effect on cynical beliefs might be the
first step on this way.
Overall, as Western societies are increasingly plagued with
suspiciousness and cynical distrust (Eisinger, 1999; Twenge,
Campbell, & Carter, 2014), understanding sources of cynicism
and factors undermining its development represents an impor-
tant research endeavor. The present research has contributed to
this by uncovering one of the antidotes to cynicism--educa-
tion. Importantly, as cynicism not only is connected to multiple
negative outcomes for individuals but also represents a threat
for the functioning of democratic and economic institutions
(Knack & Keefer, 1997; Rothstein & Uslaner, 2005), policies
fostering investment in education may pave the way for a less
cynical, more open and, ultimately, successful society.

Notes
1. The gender disparity is most probably due to the fact that partici-
pants aged 60 and older were oversampled at twice the rate of the
others and women are generally overrepresented among the elderly
(Howden & Meyer, 2011). The same applies to Study 2.
2. Post hoc power analyses revealed that given the sample size of
1,087 and an effect size of partial r ¼ À.10, the power to detect
a significant effect using a two-tailed test and the conventional
level of a (.05) was 91%. In Study 2 (N ¼ 10,072), the power
reached 100% (including the mediation analyses).

w2(159) ¼ 39,133.42, p < .001, comparative fit index ¼ .68, root
mean square error of approximation ¼ .16, standardized root mean
square residuals ¼ .14. This one-factorial solution was signifi-
cantly worse than the two-factor model (w2[5] ¼ 33,228, p < .001).
4. The w2 difference test was significant (see Supplemental Table S1).
Yet, differences in incremental fit indices are preferred over the w2
test in large samples (here, N > 10,000), as the latter is sample size
sensitive (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002).
