Decreased renal function among adults with a history of
nephrolithiasis: A study of NHANES III.
Background. Although intuitively appealing, the hypothesis
that nephrolithiasis is associated with decreased renal function
has not thoroughly been investigated. Because the prevalence
of nephrolithiasis and chronic renal disease in westernized so-
cieties has risen over the past three decades, we sought to de-
termine if persons with a history of kidney stones have lower
renal function relative to nonstone formers.
Methods. We used data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to compare es-
timated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between persons over
age 30 with and without a history of kidney stones. In total, 876
persons with a history of stones, and 14,129 persons without
stones were available for analysis.
Results. We observed that the association between history of
stones and estimated GFR depends on body mass index (BMI)
(P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounding factors,
mean estimated GFR in stone formers with a BMI 27 kg/m2
was 3.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 lower than that of similar nonstone for-
mers (95% CI -5.8, -1.1) (P = 0.005). No difference was found
among persons with a BMI <27 kg/m2. The probability of an
overweight stone former having an estimated GFR between 30
and 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 relative to a GFR above 90 mL/min/1.73
m2 was nearly twice that of a similar nonstone former [relative
risk ratio (RRR) = 1.87, 95% CI 1.06, 3.30].
Conclusion. Among overweight persons, nephrolithiasis may
not merely be a disease of stones, but may also reduce kidney
function. Further work in alternate study samples is needed to
validate this finding and determine the mechanisms responsible.
The impact of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) on
public health has been well documented. The prevalence
of elevated serum creatinine (>1.5 mg/dL in men and
>1.4 mg/dL in women) in the Framingham Heart Study
was estimated at 8.0% for men and 8.9% for women [1],
while more than 300,000 persons in the United States
have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [2]. Alarmingly, the

incidence of CRI is rising throughout the world [3]. With
respect to patient outcomes, CRI patients suffer from an
increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease rel-
ative to the general population [4, 5]. Given the number
of persons at risk for CRI and the prognosis associated
with the disease, identification of risk factors for the de-
velopment of renal disease has become a top priority to
researchers in the nephrology community.
As the incidence of CRI has risen over the past three
decades, the frequency of nephrolithiasis in westernized
societies has also increased. Recently, the prevalence of
nephrolithiasis among 20- to 74-year-old patients in the
United States was estimated to be 5.2% during the years
1988 to 1994, compared to 3.8% from 1976 to 1980 [6].
While much is known about the pathogenesis and treat-
ment of nephrolithiasis [7], the clinical consequences of
stone disease remain relatively unidentified. In particu-
lar, little is known about the effect of stone disease on
renal function. Our hypothesis is that repeated transient
obstruction from stone passage, treatments such as ex-
tracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), and possi-
bly mineral deposits in the renal medulla may damage
nephrons and reduce renal function [8­10]. The current
study uses national health survey data collected during
the years 1988 to 1994 to compare renal function, as
measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR),
between persons with and without a history of
nephrolithiasis. We hypothesized that stone formers
would have lower estimated GFR when compared to sim-
ilar nonstone formers.
METHODS
Study population
Data from the NHANES III was used for this anal-
ysis. A detailed description of the methods used in the
survey is available elsewhere [11]. Briefly, NHANES III
was one of several periodic surveys conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics. The survey, conducted
during 1988 to 1994, was designed to provide national es-
timates of health and nutritional status in the civilian non-
institutionalized United States population aged 2 months
685
686 Gillen et al: Decreased renal function and nephrolithiasis
and older. Data collected in NHANES III included so-
ciodemographic factors, medical history, health-related
behaviors, and medication use. Ultimately, 33,994 per-
sons were interviewed. In the current study, we limit our
analysis to adults aged 30 to 90 years with information on
the lifetime occurrence of kidney stones (N = 15,005).
The choice to restrict our analysis to individuals over
30 years of age was based primarily on two factors. First,
the prevalence of stones among individuals less than
30 years of age is quite low, yet these individuals carry
great sampling weight in the NHANES survey (due
to oversampling of the elderly). Thus, any conclusions
drawn would be quite heavily influenced by a relatively
small number of stone formers in this age group. Sec-
ond, we hypothesized that the effect of nephrolithiasis
on renal function is a cumulative one that may take many
years to manifest. Thus by focusing on individuals over
30 years of age, this would provide ample time for the
effects of stone disease on renal function to begin to
develop.
Exposure and outcome definitions
The primary exposure in our analysis was any history
of kidney stones. All participants over age 30 who an-
swered "yes" to the question "Have you ever had a kid-
ney stone?" (N = 876) were considered to have a history
of nephrolithiasis. Persons who responded "don't know"
(N = 13) or did not respond (N = 8) were excluded. The
outcome of interest was taken to be renal function as
estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(MDRD) equation [12]. Thus, GFR was estimated as

where SCr

urea nitrogen, and Salb

et al [13] have reported that the assay used for measur-
ing serum creatinine in the NHANES study resulted in
creatinine levels systematically higher than those used to
obtain the MDRD prediction model. As a consequence,
they suggest creatinine values from NHANES III be
recalibrated to account for an average overestimate of
0.23 mg/dL. All analyses presented here have performed
the recommended recalibration.
Statistical analysis
All reported point estimates and standard errors incor-
porate the NHANES III survey weights which account
for unequal probability of selection into the NHANES
sample and survey nonresponse. Variance estimates were
computed via the method of linearization [14]. Patient
characteristics, adjusted for stone history and age, were
compared using linear regression for continuous covari-
ates and logistic regression for categorical covariates.
Multiple linear regression was used to compare mean
estimated GFR between stone formers and nonstone
formers. Covariates identified as potential confounders
in the relationship between estimated GFR and stone
history were adjusted for. These included age, gender,
race (African American vs. other), boxy mass index
(BMI), systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c
),
diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial
infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure), smoking sta-
tus (ever vs. never), health insurance status, and use of
prescription diuretics. Other covariates considered as ad-
justment variables but not presented here include alco-
hol use, selected dietary factors, including calcium intake,
household income, and marital status. Multiplicative in-
teractions between stone history and age, gender, race,
diabetes, and BMI were formally tested. The presented
analyses include adjustment for BMI as a continuous lin-
ear covariate. However, to address the potential for resid-
ual confounding by BMI, secondary analyses adjusting
for BMI as a categorical covariate (based upon quintiles
of the distribution) were also performed. As these results
did not qualitatively change our findings, we have chosen
to present models adjusting for BMI as a continuous lin-
ear covariate. In addition, a separate linear regression
model among persons with a history of stones was con-
ducted to examine the association between prior stone
treatment and estimated GFR.
It was a priori hypothesized that stone formers would
not merely experience a downward shift in the distribu-
tion of GFR, but that the distribution of GFR among
stone formers would be skewed to the right, resulting
in a higher proportion of persons in the lower-tail of
the distribution of GFR. To test this hypothesis, esti-
matedGFRwascategorizedusingcutpointssuggestedby
the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Dialysis Out-
comes and Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines for
classification of CRI: less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2,
30 to 59 mL/min per 1.73 m2, 60 to 89 mL/min per
1.73 m2, and 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or above [15].
Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare the
relative risk of having an estimated GFR in a lower
category relative to the highest category between per-
sons with and without nephrolithiasis. Model based es-
timates are reported as relative risk ratios comparing
stone formers with nonstone formers. Adjustment co-
variates included in the multinomial logistic regression
included age, gender, race, BMI, systolic blood pressure,
HbA1c
, diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, smok-
ing status, health insurance status, and use of prescription
diuretics.
All statistical analyses were performed using con-
ventional commercial software (Stata Corp. 2003, Stata

RESULTS
Table 1 displays age adjusted characteristics of the
study sample extrapolated to the noninstitutionalized
United States population using sample weights provided
by NHANES. Displayed means represent the weighted
average of each covariate for an individual of age 50
(the approximate overall mean age of the study sam-
ple). After exclusion for missing stone history, 15,005
persons were available for analysis (14,129 nonstone
formers and 876 stone formers). After adjustment for
age, persons with a history of kidney stones tend to be
male,non-AfricanAmerican,heavier,morelikelytohave
smoked, more likely to have had prior cardiovascular dis-
ease, and have higher blood pressure. After adjustment
for age it was estimated that stone formers have lower
mean estimated GFR (and higher mean serum creati-
nine) than nonstone formers (93.1 mL/min per 1.73 m2
vs. 95.6 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for an individual of age
50) (P = 0.008). Among stone formers, approximately
41% received medication for their stones, 7% underwent
ESWL therapy, and 19% underwent surgery to remove a
stone.
Multiple linear regression results modeling estimated
GFR as a function of stone history with adjustment for
age, gender, race, BMI, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c
,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, insurance sta-
tus, and use of diuretics are presented in Table 2. A sig-
nificant interaction between stone history and BMI was
detected at the analysis stage (P = 0.004), indicating that
the association between stone history and estimated GFR
is dependent upon body size. As a result, all remaining
analyses presented are stratified by BMI level (<27 kg/
m2 vs. 27 kg/m2). A BMI of 27 kg/m2 was chosen
as a stratification cut point because it represented the

with a history of kidney stones to those with-

the stratified, multistage sampling design of
the Third National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES III) and is in-
terpretable as the relative risk of having a
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in one cate-
gory relative to having a GFR in the reference
category among persons with a history of kid-
ney stones divided by the similar relative risk
in those with no history of kidney stones. All

body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pres-

estimated median BMI of stone formers in the sample.
Among persons with a BMI less than 27 kg/m2, history
of stone disease was not found to be associated with
estimated GFR (adjusted mean difference = 1.6; 95%
CI -1.4, 4.5) (P = 0.287). However, among individuals
with a BMI  27 kg/m2, stone formers were found to have
an estimated GFR 3.4 mL/min per 1.73 m2 lower on aver-
age when compared to nonstone formers (95% CI -5.8,
-1.1) (P = 0.005). Additional analyses comparing mean
estimated GFR between stone formers and nonstone for-
mers within categories of obesity as defined by the World
Health Organization (WHO) (BMI <25 kg/m2, BMI be-
tween 25 and 30 kg/m2, and BMI >30 kg/m2) [16], were
also conducted. These analyses again suggest a reduction
in GFR among stone formers with a high BMI. After ad-
justment for those potential confounding factors listed
above, the mean difference in estimated GFR comparing
stone formers to nonstone formers was calculated to be
1.7 (95% CI -2.2, 5.5) (P = 0.385), -1.4 (95% CI 3.3,
0.5) (P = 0.138), and -3.5 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (95%
CI -6.7, -0.2) (P = 0.040) among persons with a BMI
less than 25, between 25 and 30, and greater than or equal
to 30 kg/m2, respectively.
Figure 1 displays model-based relative risk ratio
(RRR) estimates comparing the probability of low es-
timated GFR relative to an estimated GFR greater than
90 mL/min per 1.73 m2 between stone formers and non-
stone formers. No association was found between stone
history and estimated GFR among nonoverweight indi-
viduals. However, among individuals with a BMI greater
than 27 kg/m2, there exists an association between stones
and renal function. Relative to having an estimated GFR
greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2, the odds of hav-
ing an estimated GFR less than 30, 30 to 59, and 60 to 89
mL/min per 1.73 m2 were estimated to be 1.49-, 1.87-, and
1.66-fold higher among persons with a history of stones
when compared to those without, respectively. Although
the RRR comparing the lowest estimated GFR group to
the highest was not found to be statistically significant,
the RRR associated with the other two categories was
significantly greater than 1 (P = 0.030 and P = 0.010,
respectively).
Given potential imperfections in our estimate of GFR,
secondary analyses modeling log-serum creatinine were
also performed and similar associations were found. In
addition, subanalyses among persons with a history of
stone disease were conducted to determine if stone treat-
ment is associated with lower estimated GFR (results not
shown). After adjustment for those confounders consid-
ered above, surgery, ESWL, nor the use of stone med-
ications was found to be significantly associated with
reduced GFR.

CONCLUSION
Using a nationally representative sample, we found
that among overweight persons, stone formers had lower
estimated GFR when compared to similar nonstone for-
mers. Further, the probability of an overweight stone for-
mer having an estimated GFR between 30 and 59 mL/
min/1.73 m2 relative to a GFR above 90 mL/min/1.73 m2
was observed to be nearly twice that of a similar non-
stone former. However, no significant differences in
estimated GFR comparing stone formers to nonstone for-
mers were observed among persons with a BMI less than
27 kg/m2. These finding imply that among overweight in-
dividuals, nephrolithiasis may not simply be a disease of
stone formation in the collecting system but also involves
the kidneys in ways that lead to decreased nephron num-
ber or function.
Our finding that a history of stones is associated with
lower estimated GFR among persons with a BMI greater
than 27 kg/m2 may be attributable to many factors. First, it
has been shown that formation of calcium oxalate stones
is associated with the deposits of apatite particles in the
basement membranes of the thin loops of Henle and in
the deep medullary interstitium [10]. Although intersti-
tial inflammation and fibrosis, and tubule cell injury and
loss were not prominent, the particles achieve high den-
sities in some regions and certainly could cause nephron
injury. Also, stone passage itself causes transient obstruc-
tion, and obstruction is a well established initiator of
renal damage. Finally, ESWL causes renal injury in exper-
imental animals, and may result in a loss of renal function
among humans. Although most clinical studies suggest
that initial declines in GFR improve with time [17], long-
term effects are unknown. Although we did not observe
differences in estimated GFR due to stone treatment,
our data were limited with respect to treatment history
(neither duration and dose of medication nor numbers
of surgeries or ESWL were collected in NHANES), and
given the limited number of individuals having under-
gone therapy our analysis was not adequately powered
to investigate this association.
We observed an association between stone history and
decreased GFR only among overweight individuals (BMI
>27 kg/m2). At least two possible explanations for this
differential effect exist. First, stone type may be associ-
ated with reduced GFR and higher body weight. Both
struvite stones and uric acid stones are associated with
a greater loss of renal function when compared to other
stone types [18­21], and are also associated with higher
body weight. These associations may partially explain
the interaction between BMI and stone history that was
observed in our analysis. However, these stone types
account for no more than 20% of stones, overall. An addi-
tional explanation may be that renal hemodynamics are
altered in heavier individuals; higher BMI has been as-
sociated with an increase in filtration fraction [22]. This
could raise intraglomerular pressure, and increase sus-
ceptibility to renal damage. Renal hemodynamic changes
return to normal following weight loss [23]. This hypoth-
esis is supported by studies finding that obesity is a risk
factor for decreased GFR in various conditions [24­28].
Moreover, elevated BMI has been found to predict new
onset kidney disease in a recent longitudinal study [29].
Therefore,ifkidneystonediseaseresultsinsomeabsolute
loss of nephrons, overweight individuals may experience
a greater loss of kidney function with time.
Our study does suffer from limitations. First, we are
limited in our ability to adequately estimate an associa-
tion between stone history and renal function in young
adults due to a lack of data on stone formers less than
age 30. Further data on young stone formers are needed
to address this issue; however, this should not affect the
results found among older stone formers. Next, we did
not have information on the total number or type of
stones for individuals. Although this data may have been
helpful in further investigating the link between stone
disease and reduced GFR, it was not necessary for estab-
lishing an association between stone history and GFR.
It is unlikely that perfect classification of the exposure
of interest was attained in the NHANES survey. With
this said, the study is not likely to suffer from recall bias
since kidney stones are painful and rarely mistaken for
any other disease. Thus any misclassification in the study
would likely be nondifferential and would only result in
an underestimation in the magnitude of the association
between stone history and GFR. Finally, since this is an
observational study there is the potential for unmeasured
confounders. One example is the use of thiazides, as they
are commonly prescribed in the stone-forming popula-
tion and have been linked to reduced GFR. Although
specific information on the use of thiazides is not avail-
able in NHANES, we were able to adjust for use of any
prescription diuretics, which did not change the results
of the analysis. In addition, limited data on dietary fac-
tors previously linked to stone formation, such as calcium
intake [6], were available from NHANES via 24-hour re-
call. Secondary analyses adjusting for dietary factors also
did not affect the presented results.
Our findings indicate that nephrolithiasis may be asso-
ciated with nephron damage in a significant number of
individuals. That an increased BMI may potentiate re-
nal damage in this setting is important, as persons with
stones tend to be heavy. Further work in alternate study
samples is needed to validate this finding and to deter-
mine the mechanisms for the association between kid-
ney stones and decreased GFR. However, this is the first
study to show such a connection in a nationally repre-
sentative sample of the United States population. Given
our observations, the serious nature of renal disease and
