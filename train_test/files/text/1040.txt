Objectives. To examine the influence of social networks and social engagement on cognitive decline in a population-
based cohort of elderly people, and to assess gender differences in the effect of social relations on cognition.
Methods. A longitudinal study of community-dwelling people over 65 was carried out. Cognitive function (orientation
and memory) in 1997 and cognitive decline (absent, mild, and severe) over 4 years (1993­1997) were assessed using an
instrument previously validated for populations with a low level of education. The effect of social networks, social
integration, and social engagement with friends, children, and relatives on cognitive function and cognitive decline was
estimated by multiple linear and logistic regressions after adjusting for age, sex, education, depressive symptoms, systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, and functional status.
Results. Poor social connections, infrequent participation in social activities, and social disengagement predict the risk
of cognitive decline in elderly individuals. The probability of cognitive decline was lower for both men and women with
a high frequency of visual contact with relatives and community social integration. Engagement with friends seemed to be
protective for cognitive decline in women but not in men.
Discussion. This longitudinal study indicates that few social ties, poor integration, and social disengagement are risk
factors for cognitive decline among community-dwelling elderly persons. The nature of the ties that influence cognition
may vary in men and women.
RESEARCH over the past decades has demonstrated that
social relations, including social networks, social in-
tegration, and social engagement, impact significantly on the
mental and physical health of elderly people (Berkman &
Syme, 1979; Berkman, Glass, Brissete, & Seeman, 2000;
Seeman, 2000). However, the study of the influence of social
relations on human cognitive decline is recent. A few
longitudinal studies of community-dwelling older people have
indicated that the probability of cognitive decline and dementia
is higher in individuals who are isolated, have poor social
networks and support, and are not very physically active
(Balfour, Masaki, & Launer, 2001; Bassuk, Glass, & Berkman,
1999; Covinski, Barnes, Lui, Nevitt, & Yaffe, 2001; Fabrigoule
et al., 1995; Fratiglioni, Wang, Ericson, Maytan, & Winbland,
2000; Seeman, Albert, Lusignolo, & Berkman, 2001).
Berkman and colleagues (2000) have proposed a cascading
causal process beginning with the macrosocial to psychobio-
logical processes by which social relationships influence health.
We have adopted this model to explore the relations between
social integration and cognitive aging. Social networks are
embedded in a larger social and cultural milieu in which
upstream forces (political economy, social stratification, gender
roles) condition network structure. Moving downstream we
argue with Berkman and colleagues that social networks affect
social and interpersonal behavior. Networks operate at the
behavioral level through primary pathways, including social
engagement and the flow of social support. These microsocial
and behavioral processes influence more proximal pathways
to cognitive aging, such as depression, direct physiological
responses to stress, and life habits that increase the probability
of developing health conditions that lead to cognitive decline.
This model allows for definition of concepts such as social
integration, social networks, and social support. Social in-
tegration is defined as involvement with ties spanning the range
from intimate to extended. Social networks are defined by their
structure (number of ties, proximity of ties) and function
(frequency of contact, reciprocity). Networks can be further
classified into subnetworks according to the nature or role
specificity of the tie (friends, relatives, children, couple). We
argue that both the structural characteristics of the network and
the nature of the ties may have important and separate effects
on cognitive aging, as proposed by Glass and colleagues to
explain the relationship between social integration and health
status (Glass, Mendes de Leon, Seeman, & Berkman, 1997).
We also argue that social integration is beneficial for
maintaining cognitive function, yet the nature of beneficial
social relationships may vary in men and women. We followed
the hypothesis formulated by Taylor and colleagues (2000)
based on evidence of sex differences in the neurobiology of
stress responses and in patterns of affiliation under stress. The
fight or flight response may stem from an androgenic response
to threat, activated in part by testosterone.

Animal studies suggest that, in females, the neuro-endocrine
system favors an affiliative response to stress--rather than
a fight or flight response. This literature indicates that whereas
males may respond to stress by ``fighting'' or ``fleeing,''
females tend to respond in dyadic fashion (e.g., by bonding
with other females or with their young). The ``tend and
befriend'' pattern may be maintained not only by sex-linked
endocrine responses to stress but also through social roles.
Hence the nature of social networks and support associated
with the maintenance of cognitive function may differ among
men and women.
Anthropological and survey studies indicate that men and
women do tend to behave differently under stress. Men tend to
form larger groups than women, and male groups are often
organized around defined purposes or tasks. Although men
invest in a large number of social relationships, many of these
relationships emphasize hierarchy over intimate bonding
(Baumeister & Sommer, 1997).
In this article, data from a longitudinal study of community-
dwelling people over age 65 have been analyzed to examine
two hypotheses: (a) Older men and women with poor social
networks, little social integration, and little social engagement
are at high risk of cognitive decline, independent of established
risk factors, namely, age, level of education, depression, blood
pressure, and functional limitations and (b) the nature of
the social relationships associated with the maintenance of
cognitive function differ by sex in older adults. More
specifically, emotional ties with peers would be stronger
predictors of sustained cognitive function for women than for
men; and formal roles in families and other social organizations
would be stronger predictors of sustained cognitive function for
men than for women.
METHODS
Participants
The study population was a stratified random sample (n 5
1,540) of community-dwelling people over 65 living in
Legane
´s, a suburban municipality located 8 km outside Madrid,
Spain (Zunzunegui, Be
´land, & Gutierrez-Cuadra, 2001). The
sample is representative of the elderly people in Legane
´s whose
age, sex, marital status, and education resemble those of the
Spanish elderly population as a whole. Data were collected in
1993, through two home interviews and a medical exam.
Response rate was 83% (n 5 1,284) in the first interview and
91% (n 5 1,165) in the second interview, which included the
medical exam. Because clinical diagnosis of dementia at
baseline was not carried out, 99 subjects with severe cognitive
deficit (5 or more errors in an 8-item version of the Short
Portable Mental Status Questionnaire) were excluded from the
analysis for this study. In addition, 102 subjects with visual
impairments (unable to see 23-point characters) were also
excluded because they were likely to experience difficulties in
the visual memory test. Therefore, the sample used in this study
includes 964 elderly people. In 1997, the subjects were re-
interviewed and reexamined.
Measurements
Cognitive performance was measured during home inter-
views using a scale that included several items on orientation
and memory, excerpted from the Short Portable Mental Status
Questionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975), the Barcelona Test (Pen
~a-
Casanova et al., 1997), and the EPESE short story recall
(Coroni-Huntley, Brock, Ostfeld, Taylor, & Wallace, 1986).
This scale was developed to assess cognitive function in elderly
populations with low levels of formal education, for which
available tests have a strong education bias (Zunzunegui,
Gutierrez-Cuadra, Be
´land, del Ser, & Wolfson, 2000). Two
dependent variables were considered: a continuous, almost
normally distributed score in 1997, and a categorical measure-
ment defined over the distribution of cognitive change between
1993 and 1997 (cognitive score in 1997 2 cognitive score in
1993). The change score distribution had a mean of 21 and
a standard deviation of 27, and the following arbitrary
categorization of change was established: a change score
within one standard deviation below the mean (22 to 27) was
considered as ``mild decline,'' a change score larger than one
standard deviation below the mean was considered as ``severe
decline'' (scores between 28 and 223), and finally, change
scores on and over the mean (21 to 12) were considered as
``normal.'' A severe decline was found in 11.0% of the cohort,
a mild decline in 20.6%, and no decline or improvement in
68.4%.
The study entitled Envejecer en Legane
´s was designed to
assess the role of social networks and support in maintaining
health and function in a aging Spanish population. Three
dimensions of social relations were examined in the survey:
social networks, social integration, and social engagement. The
number of monthly visual contacts and telephone contacts with
friends and relatives (other than children) was ascertained via
several questions from the MacArthur Healthy Aging Ques-
tionnaire (Seeman, Berkman, Blazer, & Rowe, 1994), and three
variables were obtained. Only half of the sample (48%)
reported having one or more friends (1 to 60) and a di-
chotomous variable was considered: has or does not have
friends. Monthly visual and telephone contacts with relatives
ranged from 0 to 35 (means of 6.21 and 5.60, respectively) and
both variables were divided into three categories for descriptive
analysis: no contacts, one to three, and more than three, but
were truncated to 15 monthly contacts (95th percentile of the
distribution) and introduced as continuous in the multivariate
analyses. We did not evaluate social networks involving
children in the same way that we assessed networks involving
friends and other extended family, because more than half of
our subjects live with their children, most of them live within
walking distance of their children and see them at least weekly,
and 93% of the sample population have children. Therefore,
frequent contact with children is almost universal and governed
by social norms. Instead, we only considered active social
engagement (parental role providing help to children, playing
an important role and being useful) with children, because this
involvement may require more mobilization of cognitive
function.
Three dichotomous markers of social integration were
recorded at baseline: (a) membership in a community associ-
ation, (b) at least monthly attendance of religious services, and
(c) visits to the community center for elderly people (social
center with recreational activities). A composite social in-
tegration index was constructed with the addition of the three
indicators (score range 5 0 to 3).

Social engagement with children, relatives, and friends was
assessed via four choice questions (three for type of social tie:
children, relatives, and friends) taken from the MacArthur
Healthy Aging Study (Seeman et al., 1994). Their wording is as
follows: How often do you feel you help your children (family/
friends)? How often do you feel useful to your children (family/
friends)? How often do you feel that you play an important
role in your children's (family's/friends') lives? Factor analysis
indicated the existence of a single factor referring to the self-
perceived usefulness to others. The Cronbach's alpha reliability
coefficient was 0.64 for children, 0.68 for family, and 0.71 for
friends. Items were recorded as 22 (never), 21 (sometimes), 1
(frequently), and 2 (always). Individuals stating that they had no
family or friends were assigned the value of 0 on the
corresponding variable. Items were added to produce one score
for children, one for family, and one for friends. For descriptive
analyses the social engagement score was categorized as low
(26 to 21), medium (0), and high (1 to 6). For multivariate
analyses the score was introduced as a continuous variable.
The following potential confounders of the association be-
tween social relations and cognitive decline were included in
the analyses: age, education, depressive symptoms, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, and functional limitations. Age and
education have previously been found to be associated with
cognitive decline in our population (Alvarado, Zunzunegui, del
Ser, & Be
´land, in press), and several studies have shown that
social relations decrease with age and are more rare for people
with lower level of education (Glass et al., 1997; Turner &
Marino, 1994). Because the level of formal education in this
population is low, subjects were classified according to being
illiterate (12%), with no formal schooling but able to read and
write (33%), with incomplete primary school (35%), and
having completed primary school (4 years of schooling for this
age cohort). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were
determined by the average of two measurements following
the procedures of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up
Study. Depressive symptomatology was measured using the
Spanish version of the Center for Epidemiology Studies
Depression Scale (Moscicki, Locke, & Rae, 1989). Four
questions regarding the performance of actions requiring
mobility and effort were asked to assess functional limitations
of the upper and lower extremities (Coroni-Huntley et al., 1986;
Nagi, 1976). Subjects received a score ranging from one to
three according to their ability to perform all four actions
without difficulty, experiencing some difficulty but able to
perform the four actions, and unable to perform at least one
action.
Statistical Analysis
A comparison between the baseline population and those
who continued in the study after 4 years was carried out to
assess possible selection bias. Bivariate analyses were
performed to examine differences in the distributions among
those who completed the follow-up and those who were lost
to follow-up due to change of residence, refusal, or death.
Differences between women and men in each variable were
also recorded.
Analysis was carried out in four phases: 1. Eleven multiple
linear regressions of the continuous cognitive score in 1997 on
social networks, social integration, and social engagement were
carried out, one regression for each independent variable.
Linear regressions were performed, controlling for age (as
continuous variable), baseline 1993 cognitive function, and
level of education.
2. A sequential hierarchical multiple regression was fitted
according to the conceptual framework (Berkman et al., 2000).
In a first step, age, education, cognitive function in 1993, and
sex were entered as antecedent or exogenous variables.
Variables concerning networks were entered; then we added
the integration index and engagement with relatives, friends,
and children. Correlations between the 11 indicators of social
relations were moderate and varied between 20.27 and 0.45.
Lastly, depression, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and
functional limitations were entered as potentially confounding
variables because they are risk factors for cognitive decline and
they may influence the likelihood of social interactions. Finally,
gender differences were tested through inclusion of interaction
terms suggested by the results of the 11 regressions of the
previous analysis. All models were adjusted by 1993 baseline
cognitive function, age, sex, and level of education.
3. The risk of severe decline in cognitive function was
estimated by comparing those who had experienced severe
decline with those who had not. Again, 11 binary logistic re-
gressions were fitted controlling for age and level of education,
separated for men and women.
4. An ordinal logistic regression was performed with the
three-category measures of decline (``no decline,'' ``mild,'' and
``severe decline'') as dependent variables to identify clinically
relevant predictors of change. The strategy of inclusion of
variables in the model was the same explained above: first age,
sex, and education; second, the network and the integration
index; and third, engagement with relatives, children, and
friends. Depression, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and
functional limitations were included in the final model as
potential confounders.
RESULTS
Followed and Lost Cases
Nine hundred sixty-four subjects (83% of the total sample)
provided complete data on cognitive function and had good
visual function in 1993, and they constitute the base popula-
tion for this study. After 4 years, 15.7% had died (n 5 152),
2.1% had been institutionalised (n 5 20), 17.4% refused to
participate (n 5 159), 7.8% were lost due to change of
residence (n 5 76), and 57.7% (n 5 557) were retested.
Compared with the 1993 study population, those who com-
pleted the follow-up were similar in marital status, social net-
works, social integration, and social engagement characteristics
(Table 1). However, poor social networks, social integration,
and social engagement were significantly associated with
mortality. The probability of death was higher for men with
less visual contacts with relatives (odds ratio [OR] 5 1.05,
90% confidence interval [CI] 5 1.01 to 1.10) and for women
who participated infrequently in social activities (OR 5 1.49,
90%CI 5 1.17 to 1.92), had infrequent social engagement with
friends (OR 5 1.15, 90%CI 5 1.02 to 1.28), and infrequent
engagement with relatives (OR 5 1.11, 90%CI 5 1.03 to
1.19).
SOCIAL NETWORKS AND COGNITIVE DECLINE S95
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Living alone was not frequent (9.8%). Contacts with
relatives were more frequent than contacts with friends.
Although 68% of the subjects had contacted three or more
relatives in the last month, only 48% reported having friends.
Only 8.6% of this sample had not been engaged in any of the
four social activities included in the index of social integration.
High engagement with relatives and children was more
frequent than high engagement with friends (Table 1). Several
significant differences were found between men and women.
Men were more likely to be married whereas women were more
likely to live alone or with family. Women reported less
extensive networks than men, that is, fewer social contacts with
friends and extended family and fewer social activities over the
past month. Only attendance of religious services occurred
more frequently among women than men. Engagement with
children and relatives occurred as frequently for men as for
women, but women tended to be less engaged with friends.
There were more women reporting cardiovascular morbidity
(51.0%), high depressive symptomatology (40.5%), and func-
tional limitations (22.7%), than men (36.0%, p , .001; 12.0%,
p , .001; 8.0%, p , .001, respectively). There were no
significant gender differences with respect to frequency of
cognitive decline: 10.5% of women had severe and 24.6% mild
decline, whereas 12.9% of men showed severe and 18.5% mild
decline.
Table 2 shows the results of the total and gender-specific
multiple linear regressions of 1997 cognitive function on each
variable of social relations, controlling for age, baseline
cognition value in 1993, and education. Visual contacts with
relatives, participating as a member of a group, attending
religious services, attending old age center, and the social
integration index were positively related to cognitive score in
1997 both in men and in women. Having friends and social
engagement with friends was associated with cognitive
function in women but not in men; this was formally tested
in the model including all subjects ( p 5 .09; bottom two lines
of Table 2).
The final multiple regression analyses results are shown in
Table 3. The frequency of visual contacts with relatives and the
social integration index are positively associated with cognitive
function both for men and women, whereas engagement with
friends is significantly associated with good cognitive function
in women and the interaction between engagement with friends
and sex is significant at p 5 .06. In addition, among men
depressive symptoms are significantly associated with poorer
cognitive function ( p 5 .03).
Table 4 shows the results of the logistic regressions of severe
cognitive decline for men and women separately. First, a higher
social integration index and a high frequency of visual family
contacts were associated with a low probability of severe
cognitive decline 4 years later for both genders. Equations for
both sexes separately seem to indicate that friends are stronger
negative predictors for women and social engagement with
children in men is also a negative predictor of cognitive decline.
Table 5 shows the results of fitting an ordinal logistic regression
equation. Here, the dependent variable was cognitive decline
with three levels: no decline, mild decline, and severe decline.
The number of relatives seen at least monthly and the social
integration index are significant predictors of cognitive decline
for both sexes. Among women, engagement with friends
predicts lower probability of cognitive decline. Neither
engagement with relatives or children was related to decline
in this final model. Depression is associated with decline in
men but not in women.

DISCUSSION
This study confirmed the results of other longitudinal studies
(Bassuk et al., 1999; Fratiglioni et al., 2000), indicating that
elderly individuals with poor social connections and social
disengagement are at increased risk of cognitive decline and/or
dementia. Three main results have been obtained in our study.
First, several areas of social relations--social networks, social
integration, and social engagement--are associated with
cognitive decline controlling for age, baseline cognitive
function, education, cardiovascular morbidity, depression, and
functional limitations. Second, formal participation in social
activities (church, social center for elderly people, group
membership, park) has protective effects against cognitive
decline. Third, the influence of social relations on cognitive
function is to some extent different for every gender. Engage-
ment with friends was protective in women but not in men.
Our findings are in agreement with one previous report
(Bassuk et al., 1999). That study used a composite index of
social networks and social integration, based on six indicators:
presence of spouse, visual and nonvisual contacts with friends
and relatives, attendance at places of worship, membership in
other groups, and regular participation in social activities. The
follow-up period was 12 years (4 measurements). At 3 years,
those who had no social ties were at increased risk of cognitive
decline after adjusting for age, education, and morbidity
conditions. Contrary to our results, this study did not find
a distinct effect for each dimension of social networks or in the
social integration measurements. Moreover, the effect of social
networks on cognitive decline was not evaluated separately for
men and women; therefore, we are not able to compare our
gender-specific results with them.
Other observations in noninstitutionalized elderly cohorts
have demonstrated associations between social networks, social
integration, and incidence of dementia. Using a community-
based cohort, Fratiglioni and colleagues (2000) showed that
those living alone or without any close social ties were 1.5
times more likely to develop dementia after 3 years of follow-
up. In the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, Balfour and colleagues
(2001) reported that a higher rate of social engagement and
participation in productive activities (helping others, paid work,
volunteer work) might reduce the risk of dementia among older
adults. In contrast, the PAQUID Study (Fabrigoule et al., 1995)
showed that active participation in leisure activities (gardening,
travelling, and knitting) predicted lower risk of dementia,
whereas group memberships and participation in social
activities were not related to the incidence of dementia after 3
years of follow-up, when baseline cognitive performance was
controlled. The authors argued that leisure activities demand
more attention and control than social ties and social
participation and have more powerful effect on delaying
dementia. However, the structural and role-specific models of
social networks were not clearly defined in their study. A recent
study of the MacArthur Successful Aging population older than
70 (Seeman et al., 2001) reported better cognitive function in 7
years of follow-up in those having a high frequency of
emotional support. Neither the number of social ties (children,
friend, and relatives) nor group participation predicted
cognitive decline in this population. Gender interactions with
social relations variables were not significant, therefore,
analysis was presented for both sexes together.

SOCIAL NETWORKS AND COGNITIVE DECLINE S97
We have chosen to analyze the effect of social relations on
cognitive function separately by gender for two reasons: the
gender-specific social context of elderly people and the evi-
dence regarding a differential effect of social relations on health
for women and men. First, there has been a marked separation
of social roles by gender in Spanish society (as in virtually
every society), with specific values and cultural norms about
social behavior and networks. Women's social role in Spain in
this older age cohort has been rather restricted to domestic life,
whereas men's role is centered on kinship. Some studies have
demonstrated gender-specific associations between social
relations and health for men and women (Berkman & Syme,
1979; Fuhrer, Standsfeld, Chemali, & Shipley, 1999; Glass
et al., 1997; Moritz, Kasl, & Berkman, 1995; Unger, McAvay,
Bruce, Berkman, & Seeman, 1999). Our results indicate that
social networks, social integration, and social engagement
operate in similar ways in both sexes, although the nature of the
relations that matter vary by gender. For women, friends appear
to play a more significant role. Our data suggest that social
relations outside of the family circle are not frequent among
women living with their spouse or with others; however,
women living alone have more frequent social participation,
contacts, and active engagement with friends and relatives.
Conversely, among men, social contacts, integration, and
engagement are not associated with living arrangements (data
not shown). It may be that social engagement outside of the
home environment is stimulating for women, whereas an active
role as head of the household within one's own family and as
member of the community is stimulating for men. Because our
results on these gender-specific effects are not conclusive,
further longitudinal research should explore these hypotheses.
There are several possible explanations of our findings about
the impact of social networks on cognitive decline in elderly
people. All of them are compatible with the data that we, and
other previous authors, have obtained, and only more refined
future research may determine the mechanisms underlying
social impact on cognition. Cognitive reserve hypothesis, often
used to explain the influence of variables such as education
and occupation, on the risk of cognitive decline and dementia
(Coffey, Saxton, Ratcliff, Bryan, & Lucke, 1999; Katzman,
1993; Reynolds, Johnston, Dodge, Dekosky, & Ganguli, 1999;
Schofield, Mosesson, Stern, & Mayeux, 1995) may also
account for our study's findings. Good social relations with
friends and relatives, throughout the life course and especially
in the late life, might produce continued mental stimulation and
better cognitive strategies or increase neural growth and
synaptic density--the ``use-it-or-lose-it'' hypothesis--delaying
cognitive impairment or protecting against pathological pro-
cesses. An alternative formulation of cognitive reserve
hypothesis should be also considered. People who have a better
neural structure, more resistant to late damage and cognitive
decline, may be also more able to acquire and maintain social
abilities and contacts, and the association between social
networks and cognition in the old age could be not causal but
a surrogate.
Alternatively, social networks could act on cognitive
function through psychosocial pathways: the individual with
more frequent contacts and integration has more opportunities
for engagement with others (Berkman et al., 2000). Our study
suggests that the effect of social networks on cognitive function
may be partially explained by the social engagement index.
Women with friends showed a better cognitive function in
1997, and the association increased when social engagement
with friends replaced the dichotomous variable ``has/does not
have friends'' in the equation. Social engagement may protect

against cognitive decline through effects on positive emotional
and cognitive states such as self-esteem, social competence, and
adequate mood (Berger, Fratiglioni, Forsell, Winblad, &
Backman, 1999; Devanand et al., 1996). Moreover, social
engagement produces an independent effect. Women with a
positive perception of their helpfulness and usefulness, and
who felt they played an important role with friends, showed
less cognitive decline. Among men social engagement with
children showed a protective effect but this association lost
significance in the final multivariate equation. In fact, social
engagement could also provide opportunities for mobilization
of cognitive functions and operate as an antidote to minor stress
(Berkman et al., 2000; Stansfeld, 1999). Physiological
mechanisms related to stress theory could also partially explain
our results. Stress may favor neurodegenerative processes,
especially in the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in the
memory process (McEwen, 1998; O'Brien, Ames, & Schweit-
zer, 1993). Furthermore, the hippocampus regulates the stress
response and acts to inhibit the response of the HPA axis to
stress. Frequent social contacts and high rates of social
integration and social engagement could dampen or moderate
the effect of stress on the activation of the hypothalamic-
pituitary adrenal axis of the central nervous system; therefore,
social relations may reduce brain damage and the effects of
aging (Berkman et al., 2000).
Some authors have stated that associations of social networks
and social integration with cognitive function could be
artifactual. Firstly, low rates of participation in social activities
and lower frequency of visual contacts could be a prodromal
feature of or a reaction to incipient dementia, rather than a risk
factor for cognitive decline. Secondly, measures of social
contacts and participation, which require a minimum level of
functional and cognitive capacity, could be confounded by
functional limitations. Thirdly, measures that rely on self-
reports of perceived engagement could be confounded by
mental decline (Glass et al., 1997). However, we excluded
cases with very low cognitive scores at baseline. Furthermore,
we found that participants with low cognitive scores at baseline
tended to either die or move out of the study area (Alvarado
et al., in press). Only 15 people completed the follow-up,
scoring less than 18 points on the cognitive test at baseline, and
our results did not change when we repeated the analysis
excluding those subjects. We showed that the association of
social contacts and the index of integration with cognitive
decline remained after adjustment for functional limitations.
Depressive symptoms were associated with severe decline only
among men but they did not confound the association between
social relationships and cognitive function because the
coefficients of the social variables remained unchanged.
This study has both methodological strengths and limita-
tions. Its strengths include the following. The study was based
on a prospective design with social variables measured at
baseline and cognitive change and decline measured after 4
years of follow-up. Social relations measurements were based
on a theoretical model that proved to be valid for elderly
individuals (Berkman et al., 2000), capturing three dimensions
of network structure (frequency of contacts, integration, and
engagement) and the role-specificity of each of them. Previous
research indicates that these three dimensions, as well as the
type of social relation, have a differential impact on health
outcomes (Seeman, Kaplan, Knudsen, Cohen, & Guralnik,
1987; Seeman & Berkman, 1988; Stansfeld, 1999), and this
study shows similar effects on cognitive function in elderly
individuals. Cognitive function was assessed using an in-
strument, validated for a population with low levels of edu-
cation, that has proven construct validity (Zunzunegui
et al., 2000). Finally we used two dependent variables:
a cross-sectional cognitive score as a continuous variable and
a categorical description of cognitive decline over 4 years. Our
analysis, using both multiple linear and logistic regressions, has
produced consistent results.
We will now discuss some limitations. Firstly, the attrition of
our baseline sample due to mortality and change of residence
was rather high, that is, 24%. However, there were no
significant differences between those who refused to continue
in the study and those who completed the exams, whereas those
who died or moved out of the area during the follow-up period
had lower cognitive performance at baseline, according to
expectations. In addition, mortality was higher among those
with infrequent social contacts and a low rate of social
engagement, especially in women--variables that were related
to cognitive decline in our study. As attrition was higher in
those with the worst baseline performance, reported associa-
tions of cognitive decline with social relations may be
underestimated in this study. Secondly, the small sample size
of our study limits the ability to explore interactions in the
multivariate models and obtain more precise estimates of the
magnitude of the effects. Thirdly, with our 4-year follow-up,
we cannot determine whether the observed effect of social
relations on cognitive function is the result of a lifelong
cumulative exposure or the result of an abrupt change from
a previous extensive network to a more limited one. Previous
studies examining the effect of social networks on mortality
have reported that the availability of a good social network is
a better predictor of survival than the changes in such a network.
Other authors agree with the fact that social networks are stable
in old age (Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987).
In conclusion, we have provided evidence that social in-
tegration, frequent contact with family and friends, and playing
an important role with significant others have beneficial effects
in maintaining cognitive function in later life.
