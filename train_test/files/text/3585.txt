Abstract
Objective: The effect of polyomavirus infection in HSCT recipients is poorly understood.
Methods: We evaluated 38 HSCT recipients. Polyomavirus was detected by nested qualitative
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of urine. The risk factors for BK virus and JC virus were
analysed. The kidney and liver functions of infected and uninfected patients were compared.
Results: BK virus, JC virus, and simian virus 40 were detected in 21%, 42%, and 0% of HSCT
recipients respectively. HCMV infection was found to be an independent risk factor for JC virus
infection (odds ratio (OR): 8.528), while transplants with mismatched HLA are more susceptible to
BK virus infection (OR: 12.000). Liver function of JC virus-infected subjects was worse than that of
uninfected subjects.
Conclusion: We must be vigilant for opportunistic polyomavirus infections in HSCT recipients,
especially those with HCMV co-infection or a mismatched HLA transplant. When unexplained liver
function deterioration is observed, JC virus infection should be considered.

Introduction
With the development of transplantation
technology and the emergence of new potent
immunosuppressive regimens, haematopoi-
etic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is now the
most efficient way to treat very high risk
haematological malignancies. Because the
recipients are consequently immunocom-
promised, they are more vulnerable to
opportunistic infections by viruses such as
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-
Barr virus (EBV) and polyomaviruses.1
These viral infections are among the most
common causes of morbidity and mortality
after HSCT.2 Polyomaviruses, members of
the Polyomaviridae family, include BK
virus, JC virus and simian virus 40 (SV40).
Following initial infections in childhood
with no or mild symptoms,3 polyomaviruses
may be latent in the kidney epithelium,
genitourinary tract epithelium and lympho-
cytes.4 When BK virus or JC virus reacti-
vates in hosts that are immunosuppressed
(such as HSCT or solid organ transplant
recipients) or immunocompromised (such as
AIDS patients), it can lead to severe clinical
diseases. For example, BK virus reactivation
can lead to polyomavirus-associated
nephropathy in kidney transplant
patients,1,3,5 while JC virus is more likely
to be associated with progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML).1,3 Some stu-
dies revealed that polyomavirus, mainly BK
virus,3,6,7 might associate with haemor-
rhagic cystitis (HC) after HSCT,3,6,7
whereas other studies showed no associ-
ation.8,9 However, it was unclear if JC virus
also induces HC in HSCT recipients.
Additionally, BK virus reactivation may
result in renal failure and allograft failure
in kidney transplant patients,10 but it was
unknown if reactivation of this virus or of
JC virus might similarly affect the kidney
function in HSCT.
In this study, we examined the occurrence
of BK virus, JC virus and SV40 after HSCT
in China, analysed the risk factors for these
viral infections, investigated if viral infec-
tions of JC virus or BK virus are associated
with HC in HSCT recipients, and explored
the effect of these viruses on kidney and liver
functions.
Patients and methods
Patients, samples and follow-up
Allogeneic HSCT recipients treated at the
First Affiliated Hospital, College of
Medicine, Zhejiang University, China, in
2010 were enrolled in this study. Patients
who died or were lost to follow-up within
one year after transplantation were
excluded. Overall, 38 subjects with a
median of age of 23 years were enrolled;
they were transplanted for a variety of
haematologic malignancies, as described in
Table 1.
Allogeneic HSCT recipients were exam-
ined in our outpatient clinic at regular
intervals after transplantation. Follow-up
was conducted biweekly in the first month,
then once per month until one year post-
transplant. As urine specimens are easier to
acquire than blood samples, which are
invasive and painful to obtain, urine samples
were collected to test for JC virus and BK
virus DNA at 6 and 12 months post-
transplant and stored at À70C. At each
follow-up visit, all clinical data were col-
lected, including HC-related symptoms.
This study was approved by the ethics
committee of the First Affiliated Hospital,
College of Medicine, Zhejiang University.
All patients gave their informed consent to
participate in the study.
Conditioning regimen, immunosuppressive
and anti-graft-versus-host disease
program
HSCT recipients received myeloablative or
non-myeloablative conditioning before trans-
plantation (Table 1). They also received
Hu et al. 763
cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and a
short-term methotrexate course from day À7
to day À1, followed by a long-term course of
cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil with
or without prednisone, tacrolimus or
azathioprine as prophylaxis for graft-versus-
host disease (GVHD). Intravenous ganciclo-
vir (5mg/kg per day) was given from day À7
to day 14 for HCMV prophylaxis, and sulfa-
methoxazole was administered for pneumo-
cystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis
(four tablets per day, twice daily) after trans-
plantation. For cases in which GVHD
occurred, the immunosuppressive program
was intensified. Prednisone was commonly
the first line therapy, and other medications,
such as tacrolimus or high doses of azathiopr-
ine, etanercept, and intravenous immuno-
globulin, were used with varying durations
according to the patient's response.
Polyomavirus detection
Polyomavirus DNA was extracted from
urine samples using AxyPrep Body Fluid
Viral DNA/RNA minikits (AiSiJin
Technology, Hangzhou, China) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. BK
virus, JC virus and SV40 DNA were
detected by nested polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR). The primers amplified a con-
served region of the T-antigen nucleotide
sequences for BK virus, JC virus and
SV40.11 All of the primers were synthesized
by Invitrogen Biotechnology Co. Ltd.
(Shanghai, China).
The reaction system and amplification
conditions were the same as those in our
previous report.12 For each amplification,
positive PCR products (BK virus, 353 bp; JC
virus, 189 bp; and SV40, 135 bp, all
sequenced by ZeHeng Technology Co.
Ltd., Shanghai, China) served as positive
controls and distilled water served as a
negative control.
The PCR products stained with ethidium
bromide were analysed by electrophoresis

on 1.5% agarose in 0.5 Â TBE gels and
visualized by ultraviolet light. Positive
products were sequenced by ZeHeng
Technology Co. Ltd. and analysed by
BLAST software.
The sensitivity of the complete procedure
was checked by amplifying serial dilutions of
plasmids in 25 ml of distilled water before
testing the urine samples. The extraction and
amplification conditions were the same as
those used for the clinical samples, and all
dilutions were assayed in triplicate.
Renal function and liver function detection
The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the
optimal indicator for renal function.13
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin
(TB), and direct bilirubin (DB) were the
most common indicators for measuring liver
function in our enrolled patients. At each
visit in this study, serum creatinine (Cr),
ALT and AST were measured by the bio-
chemical laboratory of the First Affiliated
Hospital and GFR was converted according
to the modified equations suitable for
Chinese individuals.13
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS software (version 16.0, SSPS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Patients' ages are
expressed as the median, and other quanti-
tative variables are expressed as the mean
values Æ standard deviation (SD) for
normally distributed data. These data
were compared using a t-test. Qualitative
variables are expressed as a percentage of
positive results, and the differences
between these variables were evaluated by
using the chi-square or the Fisher's exact
test. Virus risk factors were analysed by a
binary logistic regression. All p-values were
based on a two-tailed test of significance
(p < 0.05).
Results
Polyomavirus infection
Two samples were collected for every
patient; urine samples were collected in the
sixth month and the twelfth month after
HSCT and stored at À70C. The patient was
considered to be virus-infected if at least one
sample was positive. Of the 38 total patients,
eight patients were infected with BK virus
(21%) and 16 patients were infected with JC
virus (42%), including four patients who
infected with both viruses (11%). No
patients were infected with SV40. JC virus
was detected in both urine samples for only
one of the 38 patients; this virus was
detected in the sixth month and twelfth
month post-transplantation samples of
seven and eight patients, respectively. BK
virus was not detected in both urine samples
for any of the patients; this virus was
detected in the sixth month and twelfth
month post-transplantation samples of five
and three patients, respectively. Both viruses
were detected from the same sample for all
four of the patients infected with BK virus
and JC virus. The rate of JC virus coinfec-
tion in BK virus-infected patients was sig-
nificantly higher than the rate of JC virus
infection in those without BK virus infection
(p ¼ 0.001). Additionally, the rate of BK
virus coinfection in JC virus-infected
patients was also significantly higher than
the rate of BK virus infection in those
without JC virus infection (p ¼ 0.025).
Risk factors for polyomavirus infection
We attempted to analyse the potential risk
factors,12,14­17 including recipient's age,
gender, sex difference between donor and
recipient, donor being related to recipient,
ABO blood type, mismatched ABO blood
type between donor and recipient, mis-
matched human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
between donor and recipient, myeloablative
conditioning, conditioning regimen
Hu et al. 765
(including anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)),
GVHD, immunosuppressive program
(including prednisone corticosteroids, tacro-
limus, and high dose of azathioprine) and
HCMV infection. Our analyses found that
HCMV infection is a risk factor for JC virus
infection (odds ratio (OR): 8.528, p ¼ 0.041).
Additionally, a mismatched HLA transplant
is 12 times more susceptible to BK virus
infection than a matched HLA transplant
(OR: 12.000, p ¼ 0.045) (Table 2).
Haemorrhagic cystitis
Of the 38 total patients, seven patients
(18%) had HC, including six patients
within 3 months after transplantation, and
one patient in the fifth month post-
transplantation. The median time of occur-
rence was 48 days. Four of the seven patients
were infected with at least one polyoma-
virus; one patient was infected with both BK
virus and JC virus, one patient was infected
with only BK virus and two patients were
infected with only JC virus. Our limited data
on polyomavirus infection (20 cases) and
HC (7 cases) did not reveal any clear asso-
ciation between polyomavirus and HC.
The influence of renal and liver function
The Cr, GFR, TB and DB differences
between BK virus-infected patients and
uninfected patients were not statistically
significant, nor were the differences in these
metrics between JC virus-infected and unin-
fected patients (Table 3). In contrast,
although the ALT and AST were not sig-
nificantly different between BK virus-
infected patients and uninfected patients,
the ALT and AST in JC virus-infected
patients were both significantly higher than
those in patients who were not infected with
JC virus (ALT, p ¼ 0.041; AST, p ¼ 0.025).
Given that HCMV infection may affect
renal function and liver function, both the
renal and liver functions were compared
between HCMV-infected patients and
HCMV-uninfected patients; however, no
significant differences were found.
Discussion
The infection rates of polyomavirus, BK
virus, and JC virus in this study were 63%,
21% and 42%, respectively, which are simi-
lar to published results.18,19 Our previous
research demonstrated that immunosup-
pressed patients are more susceptible to JC
virus than to BK virus.12 Here, in the four
patients co-infected with BK virus and JC
virus, prior infection with BK virus or JC
virus was shown to hasten additional infec-
tion by other polyomaviruses (JC virus or
BK virus), but the exact mechanism for this
remains unknown. It is possible that the
virus-specific IgG raised against one poly-
omavirus may not confer cross-protective
immunity against other polyomaviruses.
Alternatively, polyomaviruses may affect
immune regulation, facilitating the replica-
tion and further infection of other poly-
omaviruses. Further research is needed to
validate these hypotheses.
Many previous publications have
reported an association between HCMV
and polyomavirus infection.20­23 This
association may be related to the immuno-
suppression required to prevent GVHD.
Although most of those studies revealed a

correlation between BK virus and
HCMV,22,23 we found here that there were
also some associations between HCMV and
JC virus infections. We identified HCMV as
a risk factor for JC virus infection, in
agreement with previous studies12,20,21 that
showed that cytomegalovirus replication
enhances JC virus replication and infection.
The possible mechanism of action may be
as follows. The immunoregulatory ability
of cytomegaloviruses might increase the risk
of opportunistic JC virus infections by
modulating molecules involved in
immune recognition and inflammation.12,24
Additionally, expression of the cytomegalo-
virus immediate-early 2 gene activates
early promoters of JC virus (which induce
expression of T-antigen), and various late
JC virus genes are then replicated and
expressed12,21
Here, we found that mismatched HLA
between the donor and recipient is an inde-
pendent risk factor for BK virus infection;
however, this topic is controversial.15,17,25
We hypothesize that the effect of HLA
mismatch is due to the donor immune
response. During BK virus infection, CD8-
positive cytotoxic T cells can only attack the
virus-bearing target cells that share the same
class I HLA antigens.26 Notably, when HLA
is mismatched, the CD8-positive cytotoxic T
cells might lose this ability. Thus, an
impaired immunosurveillance of BK virus
by virus-specific T-cell responses and the
major histocompatibility complex restric-
tion of the T-cell response might allow the
BK virus to escape virus-specific immunity
in a situation with mismatched HLA.17
HC is a frequent complication after allo-
geneic HSCT. Here, the HC rate was 18%,
and various studies have reported HC rates
between 10% and 70%.7 Some reports5­7
found that HC is associated mainly with BK
virus and also maybe JC virus.7 Seven
patients in this study had HC, but, in
contrast to previous reports27, their HC
was not related to polyomavirus and none
of the polyomavirus-infected patients devel-
oped polyomavirus-associated HC. One pre-
vious report6 revealed that only 10­25% of
BK viruria develops into clinically signifi-
cant cystitis and that BK viremia and peak
BK viremia (!10,000 copies/mL), but not
viruria, were independent risk factors for
HC.6 If the polyomavirus replication was
not at these peak levels in our samples, it
may explain the lack of association between
HC and polyomavirus infection that we
observed. Furthermore, there are many
other potential risk factors for HC besides
polyomavirus, such as the type of condi-
tioning chemotherapy (ex: BU-based condi-
tioning regimens),28 HLA mismatch,
GVHD, adenovirus, and HCMV7,28.

BK virus and/or JC virus are important
causes of polyomavirus nephropathy in
recipients of renal transplants,1,3 but their
significance in HSCT was poorly described.
Polyomavirus nephropathy begins as a
localized viral presence in the tubular epi-
thelial cells of the kidney and progresses to
diffuse and destructive T cell-mediated inter-
stitial nephritis.16 This interstitial infiltration
can cause scarring of the kidney paren-
chyma, loss of function, and kidney fail-
ure.16 However, during follow-up, no
neurological complications were found
among the JC virus-positive patients in this
study.
Here, we did not observe an increase in
the Cr level, regardless of whether or not BK
virus or JC virus infection occurred. Ramos'
theory of the three stages of polyomavirus
infection29 reveals that polyomavirus only
causes tissue destruction and classical poly-
omavirus-associated nephropathy, which
occur in 5­10% of transplant patients,
during the third stage. Therefore, it is not
surprising that we did not find renal dys-
function in any of the polyomavirus-infected
patients because their polyomavirus infec-
tions would still be in the first or second
stage, during which there is no clinical
abnormality and renal function is still
normal.
To the best of our knowledge, almost no
studies have focused on the effect of poly-
omavirus on the liver function of transplant
recipients. Only Demir-Onder K et al.30
reported that BK virus is a factor that
should be considered when unexplained
renal or liver function deterioration is
observed in liver transplant recipients.
To our surprise, we found that JC virus
infection could cause liver function damage.
The exact pathophysiologic basis underlying
this situation remains unknown. It is pos-
sible that JC virus reaches the liver via the
blood flow through a mechanism that allows
it to escape virus-specific immune surveil-
lance, subsequently inducing liver cell
damage by direct virus attack as well as by
indirect immune attack. Further research is
needed to validate this hypothesis.
As with all studies, our work has some
limitations. First, we only collected urine
samples for qualitative PCR detection; we
did not collect blood samples and conduct
quantitative PCR detection. Furthermore,
for consistency, samples were collected at 6
and 12 months post-transplantation regard-
less of when symptoms occurred, so the
results do not necessary match up with the
timing of symptoms. These shortcomings
will have some impact on the accuracy of the
results of this study. Lastly, this study only
investigated BK virus, JC virus and SV40.
Further studies are needed to investigate
other related pathogens, such as KI poly-
omavirus (KIPyV), wupolyomavirus
(WUPyV) and MC polyomavirus (MCPyV).
In summary, the data presented in this
study reveal the frequent occurrence of
polyomavirus in HSCT recipients, with JC
virus being the most common pathogen.
HCMV infection is a risk factor for JC virus
infection, and mismatched HLA may induce
BK virus infection. Polyomavirus-related
HC, polyomavirus-induced nephropathy
and renal dysfunction were not found.
Nevertheless, JC virus-related liver function
damage was present. Therefore, we should
be alert to potential opportunistic polyoma-
virus infections in HSCT recipients, espe-
cially those with the risk factors mentioned
above. Furthermore, when unexplained liver
function deterioration is observed, polyo-
mavirus JC virus infections should be con-
sidered as a possible cause.
