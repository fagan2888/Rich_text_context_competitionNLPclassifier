Abstract
Objectives: We examined whether state laws and district policies pertaining to nutritional restrictions on school fundraisers
were associated with school policies as reported by administrators in a nationally-representative sample of United States
public elementary schools.
Methods: We gathered data on school-level fundraising policies via a mail-back survey during the 2009­10 and 2010­11
school years. Surveys were received from 1,278 public elementary schools (response rate = 60.9%). Data were also gathered
on corresponding school district policies and state laws. After removing cases with missing data, the sample size for analysis
was 1,215 schools.
Results: After controlling for school characteristics, school policies were consistently associated with state laws and district
policies, both those pertaining to fundraising generally, as well as specific restrictions on the sale of candy and soda in
fundraisers (all Odds Ratios .2.0 and Ps,.05). However, even where district policies and state laws required fundraising
restrictions, school policies were not uniformly present; school policies were also in place at only 55.8% of these schools, but
were more common at schools in the West (77.1%) and at majority-Latino schools (71.4%), indicating uneven school-level
implementation of district policy and state law.
Conclusions: District policies and state laws were associated with a higher prevalence of elementary school-level
fundraising policies, but many schools that were subject to district policies and state laws did not have school-level
restrictions in place, suggesting the need for further attention to factors hindering policy implementation in schools.

Introduction
In recent years, the school food environment has been a focal
point in efforts to reverse the childhood obesity epidemic [1­4].
With recent estimates showing that one-third of children ages 6­11
years old in the United States (U.S.) were overweight or obese
during 2009­10 [5], continued attention to these effort is needed.
Foods and beverages sold in schools are generally broken into two
categories: 1) school meals; and 2) competitive foods, which
include all foods and beverages sold or offered to students outside
of the meals programs. Competitive products typically include
items sold in vending machines, school stores and snack bars, or a
`
la carte in the cafeteria, through in-school fundraisers, and offered
to students during classroom parties and as rewards in the
classroom [6].
Competitive foods and beverages are widely available in schools
[7,8]. Nationwide data from the 2009­10 school year indicate that
65% of U.S. public elementary-school students could purchase
foods or beverages from competitive venues (vending machines,
school stores/snack bars, and or a
` la carte lines) [9]. The third
School Nutrition and Dietary Assessment Study (SNDA-III),
conducted during the 2004­05 school year, indicated that 73% of
public elementary schools offered at least one source of
competitive foods and beverages, including the traditional sales
venues (vending machines, school stores/snack bars, and a
` la carte
lines) as well as fundraisers, parties, and given as rewards in the
classroom; furthermore, 29% of elementary school students
consumed competitive items during the average school day [10].
Although many studies have examined the availability of
competitive foods and beverages in tradition sales venues [10­
18], less work has examined the prevalence and characteristics of
school fundraising activities, or the extent to which school
fundraising practices are associated with policy restrictions on
items sold through fundraisers.
Nationwide data suggest that school fundraisers are common in
the U.S., and, therefore, are an important component of any

strategy to change the competitive food environment in schools.
SNDA-III results from 2004­05 indicated that classroom parties,
bake sales and other fundraisers were a common source of
competitive foods for elementary school students [10], with 37% of
public elementary schools holding some sort of fundraiser [7].
Higher estimates were obtained by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's nationally-representative School Health
Policies and Programs Study 2006, which found that at 76% of
elementary schools, an organization such as the parent-teacher-
association sold foods or beverages at school or in the community
to raise money [12]. Specifically in elementary schools, the items
sold were chocolate candies (50% of schools), baked goods (50% of
schools) and sugar-sweetened beverages (21% of schools) [12].
Research is accumulating to demonstrate that policies regarding
competitive food and beverages--including those sold as well as
those offered in the classroom and in other ways on campus--are
significantly associated with children's diets and weight status, and
a recent comprehensive research review documents the impor-
tance of such policies in schools [19]. Although, the evidence
specifically relating to fundraisers is fairly limited thus far, research
suggests that school fundraisers may be associated with student
weight outcomes. Kubik and colleagues [20] found that in
Minnesota middle schools, school practices--including fundrais-
ing--were associated with student body mass index (BMI). Higher
scores on a school food practices scale that included classroom and
school-wide fundraising activities (as well as allowing foods and
beverages in the classroom, snacks and beverages in hallways, and
food-based rewards) were associated with higher student BMI
scores [20]. However, the specific association between fundraising
activities and student BMI was not examined.
With regard to strategies for improving school fundraising
practices, some work in secondary schools has established a link
between fundraising policies and school practices. In a study of 45
middle schools and 71 high schools in the Midwest during 2006,
37% of schools used chocolate, candy, and high-fat baked goods
for school-wide fundraising activities, and 50% of schools had
policies addressing the nutritional quality of foods and beverages
used in fundraising [21]. Healthful fundraising policies were
associated with school practices, and there was a greater
concordance between school fundraising policies and practices in
middle schools than in high schools [21]. However, while it is clear
that fundraising activities are a source of high-calorie foods and
beverages in elementary schools [10], thus far little attention has
been paid to the relationship between policy efforts to change
school food-related fundraising and implementation at the
elementary-school level. State-specific research has shown that
policy strategies can impact school practices. For example, the
Arkansas Act 1220 of 2003--one of the first and most
comprehensive state laws to combat childhood obesity--created
a statewide health advisory committee to develop specific
recommendations for nutrition in schools, and also required
school districts to establish committees to develop locally-relevant
policies for schools. Subsequently, the prevalence of school policies
prohibiting the use of food in fundraising by student groups
increased significantly, from 54% to 70% of elementary schools
[22].
In recent years, increasing attention has been directed to the
potential for state laws and school district policies to play a role in
promoting healthy school environments. In the U.S., the Child
Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 [23] mandated that
school districts participating in federal child nutrition programs
(i.e., school breakfast and lunch programs, in which most public
school districts participate) must adopt and implement a wellness
policy by the first day of the 2006­07 school year; these policies
were to include nutrition guidelines for all foods, including
competitive foods and beverages. Each local school district was
responsible for establishing the guidelines, allowing for much
variability in policy focus, strength and implementation. Since the
wellness policy mandate went into effect, policies to address
competitive foods and beverages have increased in prevalence, but
as of the 2008­09 school year, only 36% of public elementary
school students nationwide were enrolled in a district that
restricted fundraisers during the school day [17]. Further
refinements in district policies are expected, following the Healthy,
Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 [24], which continues to require district
wellness policies. This legislation also directed the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop nationwide
regulations for competitive foods and beverages (although the
federal rule will not preempt stronger state and/or local laws/
policies). Currently, the only USDA regulation regarding compet-
itive foods is a prohibit on the sale of foods of minimal nutritional
value (FMNVs)--a category that includes carbonated soft drinks
and sodas, as well as certain candies-- in the cafeteria during
meals, but these items may be sold elsewhere at school even during
lunch [6].
In the meantime, however, there is scant data on whether--or
how--state law and/or district policy efforts nationwide are
associated with school-level policies and practices. The current
study uses cross-sectional data from a nationally-representative
sample of U.S. public elementary schools during the 2009­10 and
2010­11 school years, along with corresponding district policies
and state laws, to examine the associations between state laws,
district policies, and school-level fundraising restrictions.
Methods
Data on school practices were gathered via mail-back survey.
Data on corresponding district policies and state laws were
gathered via commercially available public-use sources as
described below. This study was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
A waiver of documentation of informed consent was granted, as
consent was implied by return of the survey.
School-Level Data
Sampling and Weighting. For each year, a different sample
of schools was used, and each of the samples were developed at the
Institute for Survey Research at the University of Michigan and
were designed to be nationally-representative of U.S. public
elementary schools (containing a 3rd grade) from the contiguous
states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). School weights were
developed and adjusted for non-response bias.
Procedure. Surveys were mailed to school principals in
January of each school year, with subsequent follow-up by mail,
e-mail and telephone until recruitment ended in June of each year.
The instructions requested that the survey be completed by the
principal or other staff with knowledge of school practices
pertaining to student health. A $100 incentive was offered to the
respondent or school for returning the survey. The response rate--
calculated using the American Association for Public Opinion
Research Method Two [25]--was 60.9% (n = 1278 schools); this
was slightly higher in 2009­10 (64.5%; n = 680 schools) than in
2010­11 (57.4%; n = 598 schools). Surveys were processed and
double-entered for quality assurance.
Measures. Information on school fundraising restrictions was
gathered with three survey items. The first item asked respondents
to indicate ``Does your school have any school-wide policies
regarding the nutritional quality of items sold for PTA fundraisers
Healthier School Fundraising
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49890
or other fundraisers?'' with responses of ``Yes'' (coded = 1), ``No''
(coded = 0) or ``N/A, no fundraising.'' Two additional items asked
which of the following types of restrictions were present: 1) No
foods of minimal nutritional value (FMNVs; carbonated soft drinks
and certain candies) and 2) No soda/soft drinks. These items were
coded 1 = ``Yes'' versus 0 = ``No'' or ``No restrictions.'' For the
current analyses, the 5.1% of schools (n = 65) that did not allow
any fundraising were re-coded as 1 = yes for each of the
fundraising items (i.e., complete ban).
Contextual Factors. School-level demographic and socio-
economic data were obtained from public use data files from the
National Center for Education Statistics (Common Core of Data
2009­10). These variables were used as covariates in regression
analyses. Data were obtained on all available school characteris-
tics, coded as follows: school size (total number of students in the
school), coded in tertiles as small (,451 students), medium (451­
621 students), and large (.621 students; referent); the percentage
of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (as a proxy for
socioeconomic status; SES), coded in thirds as lower SES (.66%),
medium SES (#66% to .33%), and higher SES (#33%;
referent); U.S. census region, coded as West, Northeast, Midwest
and South (referent); and locale, coded as rural, town, suburban,
and urban (referent). For racial/ethnic composition each school
was coded as one of four exhaustive and mutually-exclusive
categories: majority ($66%) White students (referent); majority
($50%) Latino students; majority ($50%) Black students; and
diverse (no majority).
District-Level Policy Data Collection
Formal policy documents (i.e., wellness policies, associated
rules/regulations, and other policies embedded by reference into
the wellness policy/rules) were collected from the corresponding
school district for each elementary school in the sample. Policies
were gathered by trained research assistants using an established
protocol via internet searches, with telephone calls and/or
mailings to find policies that were unavailable online and to verify
complete policy collection for policies that were available online.
All district policies were reviewed and double-coded and analyzed
by two trained researchers using an adaptation of a coding scheme
developed by Schwartz and colleagues [26] and presented by
Chriqui and colleagues [27,28]. After double-coding was com-
plete, a consensus review was conducted to discuss any discrep-
ancies (,5% for these topics).
Policy provisions pertaining to fundraisers were coded as: 0 = no
policy, if there were no fundraising food/beverage standards;
1 = weak policy, if restrictions on items sold for fundraising were
vague, suggested but not required, only applied to a limited set of
products (e.g., FMNVs), or applied for less than the whole school
day; 2 = strong policy, if specific fundraising nutrition standards
were required; and 3 = complete ban, if all competitive foods were
banned. In addition, policy codes for two specific nutrition
standards were used in the current analyses, candy and regular
soda, each coded for whether the policy applied specifically to
items sold as fundraisers. The candy item was coded as: 0 = no
policy; 1 = weak policy, if the item was restricted but not
prohibited; 2 = strong policy that prohibited candy in fundraisers;
and 3) complete ban on competitive foods or fundraisers. The soda
item was coded using a five-level variable: 0 = no policy; 1 = weak
policy, if the item was restricted but not prohibited; 2 = regular
soda prohibited but not all sugar-sweetened beverages; 3 = all
sugar-sweetened beverages prohibited; and 4 = competitive bev-
erage or fundraising ban. District policy variables were collapsed
such that 1 = any strong/required policy (original codes of 2, 3, or
4, as appropriate) versus 0 = no policy or a weak policy (original
codes of 0 and 1).
State Law Data Collection
State laws, effective as of the beginning of September of each
school year were compiled through natural language and Boolean
keyword searches of the full-text, tables of contents, and indices of
codified state statutory and administrative (regulatory) laws
commercially available from subscription-based legal research
providers, Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis. Codified state statutory laws
include legislation enacted by the state legislatures while codified
administrative laws include all rules/regulations promulgated by
state Boards of Education. For purposes of this study, all those
legislative laws and rules/regulations that were formally codified
were included for this analysis. Any ``informal'' policies adopted by
state Boards of Education, for example, that were not codified into
rule/regulation were excluded from this study. The vast majority
of all such rules/regulations are codified into law and are included
herein. The codified state laws (including regulations) were
validated against publicly available secondary sources including
the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National
Association of State Boards of Education, and the National
Cancer Institute's Classification of Laws about School Students
[29­31]. State laws were coded using the same methods and
coding rubric as described above for district policies.
Data Analysis
The initial sample included 1278 schools. At 31 schools, the
survey item on school-level fundraising restrictions was skipped,
and at 28 schools, district policy data were not available (schools
within 26 unique districts). At four schools, data were unavailable
on free and reduced lunch eligibility (a covariate), thus the final
sample size for analyses reported here was reduced to 1215
schools. The samples were selected as separate cross-sectional
samples for each year, but a small amount of overlap occurred
between the two years; nine schools responded in both years, along
with 1198 unique schools (n = 649 in 2009­10 and n = 548 in
2010­11). Analyses were conducted with the data treated as a
stacked cross-sectional dataset, controlling for year.
Analyses were conducted using complex survey commands in
STATA/SE 12.0 [32] and accounted for the clustering of schools
within districts and states. Data were weighted to provide
inference to all public elementary schools in the U.S. First, the
sample characteristics were tabulated (Table 1). Then the
prevalence of school policy status was tabulated; based on cross-
tabulation of the collapsed (binary) district policy variables and the
binary state law variables, each school was classified into one of
four mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories for each
fundraising policy category of interest (i.e., overall fundraising
restrictions, no sodas in fundraisers, no candy in fundraisers): 1) no
district policy and no state law; 2) district policy only; 3) state law
only; and 4) both state law and district policy (Table 2). Then, the
relationships between state law and school policies and between
district and school policies were examined with a series of
multivariate logistic regressions that included a set of three
variables to account for district policy and state law (Table 3). For
regression analyses, a set of three dummy codes compared each of
the three latter categories against `no policy' (referent). Outcomes
were coded so that 1 = the presence of a school-level nutritional
restriction on fundraisers and 0 = no restriction. Each school
variable was matched to the relevant policy dimension (i.e.,
policies pertaining to candy and soda were used to predict school-
level restrictions on FMNVs). Table 3 also presents predicted
margins, which equal the adjusted prevalence of schools that

placed restrictions on fundraisers within each policy category (i.e.,
no policy, district-only, state-only, and both district and state),
controlling for covariates. Standard errors were adjusted to
account for the sampling variability of the covariates in the model.
Finally, to examine the characteristics of schools where the
school-level policy was or was not consistent with district policies
and state laws, Table 4 presents the percentage of schools with or
without a school-level policy regarding the nutritional quality of
items sold in fundraising, among the schools where district policy
and state law both required such restrictions. It also presents the
percentage of schools with or without a school-level policy among
schools in states where both the district policy and state law did not
require such restrictions. These breakdowns compare the
percentage of schools with a policy within demographic subgroups.
Results
As reported by survey respondents at 1215 U.S. public
elementary schools, during the 2009­11 school years, 39.2% of
schools had some sort of school-wide restriction regarding the
nutritional quality of items sold for fundraisers (see Table 1).
Percentages by year were 41.8% in 2009­10 and 36.6% in 2010­
11; as tested in a multivariate logistic regression including
covariates, this did not differ significantly across the two years.
Bans on FMNVs were reported at 25.1% of schools (25.0% in
2009­10 and 25.2% in 2010­11), and bans on soda and/or soft
drinks were reported at 21.7% of schools (20.8% in 2009­10 and
22.5% in 2010­11).
Across the two years, responding schools were located in 834
unique districts, with schools located in 407 unique districts in
2009­10 only, 383 unique districts in 2010­11 only, and 44
districts were represented for both years. Across those 834 districts,
252 (30.2%) had a strong fundraising policy. Responding schools
were located in 47 states (all states except Alaska, Hawaii,
Wyoming, and the District of Columbia), with most states (n = 44)
represented for both years, two states (North Dakota and Rhode
Island) represented for 2009­10 only, and one state (Vermont)
represented for 2010­11 only. Among the 47 states represented in
one or both years, 10 (21.3%) had a strong law. When examined in
combination (Table 2), most schools were located in districts and
states with no policy at either level; however, approximately one-
fourth of schools were subject to policies at both levels.
Across the multivariate logistic regression models--predicting
all three types of fundraising restrictions at schools--schools with a
combination of a state law and a district policy were more than
two times as likely to have nutritional limitations on fundraisers
than were schools where there was no corresponding law or policy
(Table 3). Additionally, elementary schools located in districts with
overall fundraising restrictions and prohibitions on soda sold
through fundraisers were also more likely to restrict fundraisers
and prohibit soda, respectively.
Further analysis indicated that school-level policies were not
necessarily consistent with state laws and district policies (Table 4).

tions, still only 55.8% of schools reported having a school-level
policy. This varied significantly by region and student race/
ethnicity, with school-level policies being concordant with a strong
district policy and state law among 77.1% of schools in the West
versus 39.1% of schools in the South, and for 71.4% of majority-
Latino schools compared with 44.3% of majority-White schools
and 47.0% of majority-Black schools (Ps,.01). Information given
in response to an open-ended follow-up question regarding the
types of school-level fundraising policies in place indicated that
many schools follow relevant state laws and/or district policies;
however, in some cases, respondents indicated that although their
school was subject to a district wellness policy, those fundraising
restrictions were not always followed by the school. As also shown
in Table 4, school-level policies were reported by 29.7% of schools
located in states with no law and districts with no policies,
suggesting that some schools are developing policies independent-
ly; this did not vary by school demographic characteristic.
Discussion
Our results show that elementary school-level fundraising
restrictions are related to state law and district policy, but relevant
policies and laws at the state and district level are not consistently
implemented in schools. Across the board, the combination of
policy at both the state and district level was significantly
associated with a doubled likelihood of having a school policy,
suggesting that district policies are helping to reinforce the state
laws in this area, and that policy at both jurisdictions increases the
likelihood of school-level restrictions. For overall fundraising
restrictions, having a policy at only the district level was also
associated with school-level policies; however, laws at the state
level only (in the absence of district policies) were not associated
with school-level policies. It is possible that districts are more
effective at conveying information to the school-level than are
states, or that enforcement provisions are stronger at the district
level. These possibilities warrant further examination as to why
school-level policies are more consistent with relevant district
policies, but state laws are not.
Elementary schools located within districts and states where
both had a strong policy/law were more than twice as likely to
impose nutritional restrictions on fundraisers, to prohibit FMNVs
in fundraising, and to prohibit soda in fundraising activities. In
addition, specific provisions within the policies/laws were also
associated with school-level restrictions, both for FMNVs and for
soda. Policies banning candy and soda were positively associated
with the presence of a school-level limit on FMNVs, and policy
restrictions on soda were associated with school-level bans on the
use of soda and/or soft drinks in fundraising activities. Neverthe-
less, further analysis indicated that elementary school-level policies
were not necessarily consistent with district/state policies. Where
district policy and state law required fundraising limitations, only
55.8% of schools reported having a school-level policy. The
percentage of schools with a school-level policy was higher among
schools in the West versus the South, and among those with a
majority of Latino students versus a majority of White or Black
students. The reasons for these variations are unclear but warrant
further examination, as it will be important to better understand
the barriers to school-level implementation of district policies and

state laws. Some possibilities include concerns about lost revenue
associated with implementing fundraising restrictions, regional
variations in enforcement of policies, or that certain states and
districts are more effective at conveying policy information to the
school level [33].
Encouragingly, districts are continuing to develop and strength-
en their wellness policies [28,34] and research is accumulating to
show that district policies and state laws are associated with school
practices. For example, district policies are associated with reduced
availability of junk foods and sugar-sweetened beverages in schools
[35,36]. Studies in individual states have shown significant
improvements in the school food environment following develop-
ment of laws and policies pertaining to foods in schools [22,37,38].
And, policies pertaining to competitive foods and beverages are
associated with healthier dietary behaviors and weight outcomes
among students [19].
Nevertheless, much more research is needed on the barriers to
implementation of state laws and district policies pertaining to
fundraising. With many school districts facing severe and ongoing
economic challenges, schools and parent-teacher organizations are
genuinely in need of strategies to raise funds for equipment and
student activities, but for public health reasons it is important to
raise money in ways that do not compromise students' health.
Fortunately, however, there are other options for schools to raise
funds that are both healthy and profitable. According to a report
from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, walk-a-thons,
book fairs, recycling fundraisers, auctions and car washes are all
profitable fundraising options [39].
The health consequences of consuming sugary, high-calorie
products are well documented. Given the national epidemic of
childhood obesity and the importance of providing healthy school
environments for young children, schools should consider using
non-food-related fundraisers [39] or to ensure that any food-
related fundraisers adhere to nutrition standards applied to items
sold in other competitive food venues such as a
´ la carte lines and
vending machines [1]. As the USDA develops regulations and
technical assistance materials related to wellness policies, as well as
competitive food and beverage standards as required by the
Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 [24], an opportunity exists to
include provisions related to the nutritional content of food/
beverage items sold through in-school fundraisers. In addition,
more research is needed on the student-level impact of fundraising
practices (i.e., actual student-level consumption habits and weight
outcomes).
Limitations
Relative to other data sources, these estimates are based on
large numbers of schools over two school years, and the nationally-
representative sample allows for inference to school practices
across the country. However, there are also several potential

limitations to this research. As with any survey that relies upon
reported rather than observed data, it is possible that the estimates
were affected by various reporting biases (e.g., desirability bias,
response bias); however, the weights were adjusted to account for
schools' propensity for non-response. The district fundraiser
policies and state laws were assessed based on their inclusion in
the sampled districts' congressionally-mandated wellness and
related policies and codified state laws, respectively. In other
words, we evaluated formal policies ``on the books'' rather than
any informal guidelines, parent/student handbooks, or policies ``in
practice'' that may also exist at the district and/or state levels.
Thus, the estimates of district policy prevalence are conservative
but given the relationships observed here, we expect that any
additional ``informal'' policies would only further solidify the
relationship between these policies and school-level restrictions.
One of the dimensions for the district and state coding scheme
addressed fundraising restrictions on ``candy,'' which we mapped
to school-level FMNV restrictions; this is not a perfect match
because although FMNVs include some types of candy, they do
not include chocolates, which are commonly used in fundraisers.
Thus, the policy dimension was broader than the school-level
outcome, but nevertheless both were associated.
The school survey inquired about ``school-wide policies,'' but
this does not guarantee that such policies would always have been
enforced. In other words, respondents may have indicated that the
school had a policy, but fundraising activities conducted by the
parent-teacher organization or other groups might not have
actually followed that requirement. Some respondents may have
interpreted the item as regarding only policies that were developed
at the school level, thus answering ``no'' where the school followed
district policy but did not have a separate formal school policy, per
se; however, some schools answered this item affirmatively then
wrote in that they ``follow district policy,'' and our pre-testing of
the survey with school principals did not reveal comprehension
difficulty for this item. The goal of the school item was not to
identify the source of the policy, but rather to assess whether the
school had a policy or not. Nevertheless, some under-reporting of
school-level policies (in districts that actually did have relevant
policies) may have occurred; unfortunately we could not discern
whether some of the schools in states/districts with policies that
reported not having a school policy either had mis-reported their
policy status or whether they truly did not know of or did not have
a school policy. We also did not inquire about frequency or type of
fundraising activity; in other words, our study addressed school
policies, but not actual practices. There is much variability in
practices, for example, in the frequency and type of fundraising
activities; there is certainly an important difference between a
school having a monthly bake sale in which high-calorie sugary
items are offered directly to students versus a yearly school
fundraiser that involves door-to-door sales of cookie dough or
other products. Finally, we were unable to assess the magnitude of
student exposure to energy-dense products--nor of the impact on
weight outcomes due to student consumption of such products--
through fundraising, but focused instead on school-wide fundrais-
ing restrictions. Nevertheless, the results do demonstrate the strong
association between school policies with state law and district
policy, and the continued need to promote school-level imple-
mentation of policies.
Conclusions
In summary, many U.S. public elementary schools do not place
nutritional restrictions on school fundraising activities. Few
districts and states have strong policies about the nutritional
quality of products used in fundraisers but, when they do, policies
at both jurisdictions are associated with school-level restrictions.
Revision of formal district policies and state laws to strengthen
existing provisions written as recommendations rather than
restrictions may be an effective strategy for impacting the
elementary school environment, as would the development of
new policies and laws where none exist. The USDA also has an
opportunity through the forthcoming competitive food regulations
to ensure that the standards apply broadly to all competitive foods
sold in schools, including in-school fundraisers. Additional efforts
are required to help schools follow district policies and state laws.
