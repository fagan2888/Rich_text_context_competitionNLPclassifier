Abstract
Objectives: A systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) intrauterine injection before embryo transfer on the outcome of in vitro
fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
Methods: Searches of PubMedÕ, EMBASEÕ, EBSCO, Web of ScienceÕ, SCOPUSÕ and Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted to retrieve relevant randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). Data were extracted and analysed.
Results: The meta-analysis included five RCTs (hCG group n ¼ 680; control group n ¼ 707).
Intrauterine hCG injection significantly increased rates of biochemical, clinical and ongoing
pregnancy compared with controls. There were no between-group differences in implantation or
miscarriage rates.
Conclusion: Women undergoing IVF/ICSI may benefit from intrauterine hCG injection before
embryo transfer.

Introduction
Implantation is a complex biological inter-
action between embryo and endometrium
that is critical to successful pregnancy.1
Inappropriate implantation is the cause of
two-thirds of in vitro fertilization (IVF)
failures.2 Implantation is regulated by
many factors, the most important of which
is the human chorionic gonadotrophin
(hCG) concentration.3 A positive correl-
ation has been found between hCG concen-
tration in embryo culture medium and
implantation rate, suggesting that hCG
secreted by embryos may be a useful bio-
marker for embryo selection in IVF.4 Early
embryonic hCG secretion is beneficial to
implantation.5­8
Intrauterine injection of hCG (500 IU/ml)
significantly inhibits insulin-like growth
factor binding protein 1 and macrophage
colony-stimulating factor, while leukaemia
inhibitory factor, vascular endothelial
growth factor and matrix metallopepti-
dase 9 are significantly stimulated.9 These
multiple effects appear to precede the clas-
sical endocrine role of hCG, and may
be directly involved in the regulation of
implantation.7,9
In animal models, systemic administra-
tion of hCG at the time of embryo transfer
significantly increases pregnancy rate.10
Intrauterine hCG injection is associated
with significant proimplantation changes of
the endometrium during the window of
receptivity in normal cycling baboons, and
induces a favourable uterine environment
for embryo implantation.11
Intrauterine injection with hCG (500 IU/
ml) prior to embryo transfer significantly
improves rates of implantation and preg-
nancy in IVF/ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm
injection).12 Several other studies have been
performed to assess the role of hCG intra-
uterine injection before embryo transfer in
assisted reproduction.13­16
The aim of the present meta-analysis was
to evaluate the effects of intrauterine hCG
injection before embryo transfer on the
outcome of IVF/ICSI.
Materials and methods
Literature search
Searches of PubMedÕ, EMBASEÕ,
EBSCO, Web of ScienceÕ, SCOPUSÕ and
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL) were performed from
date of inception to December 2014 using
the search strategy: (`human chorionic
gonadotropin' or `hCG' or `recombinant
hCG' or `rhCG') AND (`intrauterine' or
`intrauterine injection' or `endometrial
infusion') AND (`assisted reproductive
techniques' or `ART' or `IVF' or `ICSI' or
`in vitro fertilization' or `intracytoplasmic
sperm injections' or `embryo transfer').
A combination of text words and specific
database indexing terminology were used.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were considered eligible if they met
the following criteria: (i) randomized con-
trolled trial (RCT); (ii) patients intended to
undergo embryo transfer; (iii) comparison
made between intrauterine hCG injection or
no injection or placebo; (iv) data regard-
ing pregnancy outcomes were reported.
Exclusion criteria were: (i) experimental
group containing other therapy; (ii) com-
parison made between different hCG doses;
(iii) review articles; (iv) nonprospective
comparative studies; (v) data unavailable
for meta-analysis. Only original publica-
tions were included; conference abstracts
and dissertations were not considered. No
language restrictions were applied.
Data extraction
The initial electronic database searches to
identify potentially relevant articles for
inclusion were performed by two independ-
ent reviewers (H.Y. and J.H.). In cases of
Ye et al. 739
insufficient data, authors were contacted
for information. Any disagreements were
discussed and resolved by consensus or
arbitration by a third independent reviewer
(W-C.H.).
All retrieved titles and abstracts were
examined; those with the possibility of
meeting the inclusion criteria were kept for
further evaluation. Final inclusion decisions
were made on examination of full manu-
scripts. Reference lists of retrieved articles
were screened in order to identify additional
studies.
Primary outcomes were clinical pregnancy
rate and implantation rate. Secondary out-
comes included biochemical pregnancy
rate, miscarriage rate and ongoing pregnancy
rate.
Quality assessment
The quality of each study was assessed
according to the modified Jadad scale.17
The scale ranges between 0 and 7, and
evaluates four aspects of RCTs: adequacy
of randomization; concealment allocation;
blinding; reporting of participant with-
drawals and drop outs. A score of 0 repre-
sents the poorest methodological quality; a
score of 7 represents the strongest methodo-
logical quality. Articles with 1­3 points in
total were considered to be of low quality;
those with 4­7 points in total were con-
sidered to be of high quality.
Statistical analyses
Data were combined for meta-analysis
using RevManÕ version 5.1 (Cochrane
Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Dichotomous
data were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical
heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistic,
such that I2  50% indicated substantial
heterogeneity.18 Study data were combined
using a fixed-effects model when hetero-
geneity was negligible, or a random-effects
model in the case of significant heterogen-
eity. P-values < 0.05 were considered statis-
tically significant.
Results
The process of literature identification and
selection is summarized in Figure 1. After
exclusion of ineligible articles, the final
meta-analysis included five RCTs (hCG
group n ¼ 680; control group n ¼ 707).12­16
Characteristics of the included trials are
shown in Table 1.
Data regarding clinical pregnancy rates
were reported by four studies (hCG group
n ¼ 532; control group n ¼ 555).12,13,15,16
Pooled analysis found that clinical preg-
nancy rates were significantly higher in the
hCG group compared with the control
group. (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.61, 2.66;
I2 ¼ 0%, Pheterogeneity
¼ 1.0; Figure 2).
Implantation rates were reported by two
trials (hCG group n ¼ 388; control group
n ¼ 395),13,14 with no significant between-
group difference found (OR 1.63; 95% CI
0.87, 3.08; I2 ¼ 87%, Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.006;
Figure 3).
Biochemical pregnancy rates were
reported by two trials (hCG group n ¼ 341;
control group n ¼ 352).13,15 Meta-analysis
found that biochemical pregnancy rates were
significantly higher in the hCG group than
the control group (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.55,
2.85; I2 ¼ 0%, Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.80; Figure 4).
Data regarding rate of miscarriage were
reported by three studies (hCG group
n ¼ 472; control group n ¼ 493),13,14,16 with
no significant between-group difference found
(OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.84, 2.45; I2 ¼ 0%,
Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.88; Figure 5).
The rate of ongoing pregnancy was re-
ported by three studies (hCG group n ¼ 472;
control group n ¼ 493).13,14,16 Ongoing preg-
nancy rates were significantly higher in
the hCG group than in the control group
(OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.36, 2.33; I2 ¼ 22%,
Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.28; Figure 6).

Discussion
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is
the first known human embryo-derived
signal through which the embryo influences
immunological tolerance and angiogenesis
at the maternal­fetal interface.3,19­21 It
modulates receptivity of endometrial stro-
mal cells and endothelial cell proliferation
and migration by regulating interleukin-1
receptors during implantation. This func-
tion has an impact on angiogenesis, by
a pathway that promotes embryonic
growth.5,22,23 hCG also induces endometrial
angiogenesis at the site of implantation by
upregulating hCG receptors.22
Intrauterine hCG infusion and in vitro
treatment of human endometrial epithelial
cells has been shown to upregulate proteins
involved in implantation.9,24 The hCG
infusion into the endometrial cavity was
dys-synchronous with the timing of
physiological embryonic hCG secretion,9
which typically begins at the morula stage.
Local treatment with granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor or autologous peripheral
blood mononuclear cells is known to
improve IVF/ICSI outcomes.25­30

To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of
intrauterine hCG injection before embryo
transfer in IVF/ICSI. Our analysis indicated
that intrauterine hCG injection resulted in
significantly higher rates of biochemical
pregnancy, clinical pregnancy and ongo-
ing pregnancy compared with untreated

women. There was no effect on implantation
or miscarriage rates. The analysis of
implantation rate should be interpreted
with caution, however, because although
four of the five trials showed significantly
higher implantation rates, the pooled results
were not significant because the original
data for three trials could not be obtained
from the authors.12,15,16
The validity and interpretation of any
meta-analysis depends largely on the quality
and homogeneity of the included studies.
Although the trials included in our analysis
were all of high quality, there were differ-
ences in study population, hCG type and
time of administration, type of embryo
transferred and embryo transfer technique.
Although no heterogeneity was observed in
the analysis of biochemical pregnancy rate,
clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy
rate or miscarriage rate, there was significant
heterogeneity in the analysis of implantation
rate. In addition, due to the small number of
RCTs included in this meta-analysis, it was
not possible to perform funnel plots to
examine publication bias, or carry out sub-
group analyses or meta-regression analyses.
It has been shown that intrauterine
hCG infusion (500 IU/ml) at the time of
blastocyst-stage embryo transfer (fresh or
frozen) does not significantly improve sus-
tained implantation or delivery rates.14
Interventions found to be beneficial at the
cleavage stage should be cautiously assessed
before implementation at the blastocyst
stage. The present meta-analysis cannot
assess whether infusion of hCG at an earlier
stage, such as day 3, would enhance

implantation of embryos transferred at the
blastocyst stage.
In conclusion, this systematic review and
meta-analysis shows that patients undergo-
ing IVF/ICSI may benefit from intrauterine
hCG injection before embryo transfer.
Larger scale RCTs are required to confirm
these findings.
