Introduction
Ocean currents are driven by wind and solar heating of the
waters near the equator, although some currents result
from variation in water density and salinity. Ocean cur-
rents are much slower compared to wind speeds. However,
water is about 835 times denser than wind, so a smaller
water flow can be equivalent to wind with extremely high
velocity. Energy can be extracted from such ocean currents
using submerged turbines that capture energy from hydro-
dynamic lift and drag forces.
Different configurations of turbines are considered
for harnessing kinetic energy in ocean currents as shown
in Figures 1 and 2 (Khan et al., 2008). Axial flow tur-
bines have underwater version of wind turbines, whereas
cross-flow turbines use straight blades that are parallel
to axis or blades with helical shape. Blades of the cross-
flow turbine have cross section of a streamlined hydro-
foil. Axial flow turbines reverse the sense of rotation or
they need to be reoriented whenever the current direc-
tion reverses, whereas cross-flow turbine design allows
them to revolve in the same sense of rotation. Hence,
straight bladed cross-flow configuration is considered
for designing the turbine under consideration.
The turbine design included analysis and optimization
using computational fluid dynamics principles. Then the
turbines were tested in laboratories and a seawater channel
in North Chennai.As a result of extensive studies, National
Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) recently carried out
successful sea trials in Andaman and Nicobar Islands on a
small cross-flow hydrokinetic turbine which was designed
and developed in-house. This article presents a brief
account of the trial and the performance of the turbine.

Abstract
Harvesting marine renewable energy remains to be a prime focus of researchers across the globe both in environmental
and in commercial perspectives. India is blessed with a long coastline, and the seas around Indian peninsula offer ample
potential to tap various ocean energy forms. National Institute of Ocean Technology carries out research and various
ocean energy technologies, out of which harnessing kinetic energy in seawater currents is one. This article presents the
open sea trials recently carried out on National Institute of Ocean Technology's cross-flow hydrokinetic ocean current
turbine in South Andaman. The turbine was designed to generate 100W electricity at 1.2m/s current speed and was built
in-house. The turbine was initially tested in a seawater channel and then was deployed in Macpherson Strait in Andaman.
It was fitted below a floating platform designed especially for this purpose, and the performance of the turbine was
continuously logged inside an on-board data acquisition system. The trials were successful and in line with computations.

Sizing for 100W electrical power
generation
The total input kinetic energy in a stream of water flowing
at velocity V (Gorlov, 2001) can be calculated by
P AV
i
= 0 5 3
. 
The turbine performance is based on the turbine param-
eters such as number of blades (z), solidity ratio () and
blade profile. The number of blades was selected as three
(Castelli et al., 2012) where each blade is placed at an
interval of 120°. The solidity ratio is defined as follows


=
zC
D
where C is the chord length of the blade and D is the diam-
eter of turbine.
The design calculation was based on the performance
of straight bladed­type turbine with a coefficient of perfor-
mance of 0.3 at tip speed ratio of 1.5 from the experimental
study of Shiono et al. (2002). Here, the coefficient of per-
formance is the ratio of the gross mechanical power output
of turbine to the input power and the tip speed ratio is the
ratio of the blade speed to the seawater current speed. The
overall transmission efficiency that includes the mechani-
cal transmission and the electrical conversion was assumed
at 70%. The turbine was designed to produce an electrical
power output of 100W at approximately 1.2m/s seawater
current speed. Blade profile of NACA 0018 was selected
for the blades. However, a higher solidity ratio was chosen
to improve self-starting characteristics of turbine and its
performance in low current speeds (NIOT Report, 2015).
The following assumptions were made for designing the
turbine blades:
Design water velocity, V: 1.2m/s;
Number of blades, z: 3;
Density of seawater, w
: 1020kg/m3;
Transmission efficiency, t
: 0.7;
Generator efficiency, g
: 0.7;
Length of turbine, L: 1m;
Tip speed ratio at peak power, : 1.5;
Solidity ratio, : 0.36.
The three-dimensional (3D) model of the turbine with
0.8
m diameter and 1
m length is shown in Figure 3. The
assembled structure of the turbine can be seen with the
shaft and blade arms. One blade was held between two
blade arms, and a total of six blade arms were used to fit
three turbine blades with an angular spacing of 120°.
In towing tank testing, it was found that the cut-in speed
of the turbine was 0.8m/s. Any specific cut-out speed was
not considered while designing the turbine. The transmis-
sion was designed to transmit 70Nm torque, which is 50%
higher than peak torque at design current speed.
A two-stage timing belt drive was used to couple the
turbine to the electrical generator. An electrical alternator
of rated speed of 750
r/min was chosen in order to allow
50% increase in turbine speed above design speed. The
belt drive and the alternator assembly were placed inside
an underwater enclosure along with instrumentation.

Instrumentation and data acquisition
system
Two on-board data acquisition (DAQ) systems were
employed for data redundancy. One was placed on the
floating platform with minicomputer for data logging and
the other was placed inside the underwater enclosure as
shown in Figure 4. The enclosure housed voltage sensor
and current sensor. A rectifier converted the alternating
current to direct current. Solar photovoltaic panels were
used to charge the battery for powering the instruments
used in the system. Solar charge regulator was also placed
near the minicomputer inside enclosure. The DAQ system
had two subsystems, namely, Compact Reconfigurable
Input and Output (cRIO) System and wireless system.
The cRIO was programmed using LabVIEW-2015 in
FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) mode. It was used
along with multichannel 4­20mA analogue input modules.
Signals of 4­20mA from the speed sensor, V&I sensors of
PMSG (permanent magnet synchronous generator) and
V&I sensors of PV cRIO-9014 were processed and
stored in real time. cRIO was programmed also for the
real-time plots for monitoring the performances of the
current turbine. The CPU of cRIO was programmed to
send the data simultaneously to the on-board data
reception station on board watch-keeping boat through
radio frequency (RF) communication. Instruments placed
securely inside different water proof enclosures are shown
in Figure 4.
Testing of turbine at seawater
channel
Figure 5 shows the turbine during seawater channel testing
at 1.2m/s seawater speed as measured byAcoustic Doppler
Current Profiler (ADCP). For the prevailing water speed,
the peak electric power output of 108
W was obtained at
34
r/min turbine speed. After accounting for the losses in
mechanical transmission and alternator ­ estimated as
25% each as a result of separate exercise ­ the net and
gross mechanical power output was estimated at 130 and
156W, respectively. The coefficient of performance of the
turbine (Cp
) was found to be 0.23 at a tip speed ratio of 1.2
as seen in Figure 6. Subsequently, the turbine was consid-
ered suitable for open sea testing and Andaman was
selected as the location.
Floating platform for turbine testing
The floating platform for suspending the turbine was
designed as shown in Figure 7. The platform design was
analysed to determine deflections and utilization ratios
for all possible loading conditions. The design require-
ments were (a) maximum operational depth of 2m from
water level, (b) provision of A-frame for lifting and low-
ering the turbine with base frame (1tonne), and (c) design
for drag, mooring effects, operational loads and all
possible load combinations. Structural analysis software

STAAD Pro was used to analyse various configurations
of the platform.
The hydrostatic stability of the platform in static and
towing conditions was studied for different positions of the
turbine with respect to water level (1.4, 1.2, 0.7, -0.2,
-0.3, -0.8, -1.3 and -2.0m). The turbine position at 1.4m
above the water level was considered for towing condition.
The platform was found to be stable as the estimated trans-
verse and longitudinal metacentric heights were found to
be 10 and 3.8
m, respectively, with the turbine at -1.3
m
(below water level). The metacentric height slightly
reduced for the turbine position above water level due to
marginal increase in the distance of centre of gravity from
keel. But it was still safe.
Figure 8 shows the completed floating platform placed
in the water near jetty for testing its stability. The platform
had a provision to lower the turbine from the central moon
pool till the turbine shaft reached a depth of 2m from the
water level. The four columns were lifted or raised or held
in desired position using two chain-pulley blocks hooked
to the either side of A-frame. The floating platform was
also used to house the solar panels, batteries and data log-
ging system.
Deployment of turbine at Andaman
Island
The Macpherson Strait connects Bay of Bengal on West
and Andaman Sea on East. NIOT had earlier carried out
seawater current measurement at one location for a very
brief period. These measurements indicated that the peak
currents often exceeded 1.2
m/s and were influenced
mainly by tide. Also the wave action near Rutland Island
was negligible (NIOT Report, 2013). Hence, the location
was chosen for carrying out open sea trial. The turbine was
towed to the location marked in Figure 9.
The towing route from main bay in Port Blair to the test
location was 48
km long, and a total of 18
hours of time
was taken for towing. Upon reaching the site, the instru-
mentation was readied and the turbine was lowered to
check all systems during low tide currents at a nearby jetty.
The turbine responded well and started rotating while
the current at 2m depth was measured as 0.9m/s. On the
next day, it was lowered to the depth of 2
m from water
level. This location is along the smallest section on the
~20-m-deep channel between Rutland Island and the
smaller Lal Tikri Island.
The turbine started generating electricity whenever
current speeds were above 0.8m/s and gave consistent
performance throughout the trial period. Figure 10
shows the photographs of deployed turbine platform
taken at various times. The glowing lamps seen in pho-
tographs are powered by the electricity generated by the
turbine.
Results and discussion
The exercise generated valuable data about the perfor-
mance of the turbine and the currents at the test sites via
direct measurements. The turbine exhibited self-rotating
characteristics whenever the seawater current speed
crossed the cut-in speed of 0.8m/s. The maximum electric
power reported during the trial was 304
W. Figure 11
shows a representative time series of rectified electric
power output from turbine recorded on 7 June 2016.
During the trial, the turbine functioned at a coefficient of

performance of 0.22 that matched the earlier test results.
The turbine was retrieved after successful completion of
the trial.
Conclusion
A 0.8-m-diameter turbine with 1-m-long blades was
designed to generate 100
W electrical power at seawater
current speed of 1.2
m/s. The turbine was fabricated and
was made to undergo all possible stages of development. It
successfully generated the design power output in a seawa-
ter channel. Following this success, this turbine underwent
rigorous testing in Macpherson Strait in South Andaman.
At this location, the turbine when suspended below water
surface from a specially designed floating platform not
only generated the requisite power but also recorded a
power output as high as 304
W ­ when the currents
exceeded 1.8m/s ­ surpassing its design power of 100
W
by a huge margin. The data logging system, Wi-Fi data
transmission system and turbine control system performed
satisfactorily. The turbine was found to be self-starting at
speeds above 0.8m/s. The coefficient of performance was
estimated to be 0.22 which matched earlier testing results
very well. These tests pave the way for scaling up of off-
grid units for remote coastal locations.
