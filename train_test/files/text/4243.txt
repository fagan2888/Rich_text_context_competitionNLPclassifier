Introduction
Tinnitus, the phenomenon of ringing or buzzing in the ears
without an external sound source has evolved into one of the
most common symptoms in ENT medicine. Its prevalence
rate is estimated to be about 10% to 15% of the general popu-
lation (Hall et al., 2011). In Germany, about three million
people suffer from tinnitus, and this number is rising by
235,000 annually (Hesse & Laubert, 2010).
Tinnitus is classified according to the duration of the
symptoms. The term chronic tinnitus refers to tinnitus symp-
toms lasting longer than 3 month. The diagnosis of acute tin-
nitus comprises those perceptions that are persisting for a
maximum of 3 months.
The sudden appearance of tinnitus can be triggered by dif-
ferent factors. The most common causes are sudden sensori-
neural hearing loss as well as noise-induced hearing loss,
resulting from exposure to high-intensity sounds (acute
acoustic trauma). Furthermore, acute tinnitus frequently
occurs as a result of stressful and emotionally charged life
situations or as a side effect of medication.
The persisting tinnitus symptoms are often leading to sub-
stantial distress and, as a consequence, many tinnitus patients
display other psychiatric comorbidities or psychological
stress symptoms (Gabr, Abd El-Hay, & Badawy, 2011). For
patients with acute tinnitus, D'Amelio et al. (2004) showed
that depression and strong emotional reactions experienced
immediately after initial manifestation of tinnitus might be
of prognostic value concerning the level of emotional dis-
tress and decompensation in chronic stage of tinnitus.
To date, there are several treatment options for patients
with recent-onset tinnitus. Pharmacological approaches have
been established equating tinnitus with sudden sensorineural
hearing loss (Hesse & Laubert, 2010) or with any cochlear
damage (Shim, Song, Choi, Lee, & Yoon, 2011). However,
none of these treatment modalities has yet shown repeated
efficacy in controlled trials (Elgoyhen & Langguth, 2011).
Furthermore, different types of psychotherapeutic interven-
tion supporting and accompanying medical treatment have
been evaluated (Gerhards & Brehmer, 2010; Schildt,
Tönnies, & Böttcher, 2006). These adjuvant psychotherapeu-
tic interventions consist of one or more of the following ele-
ments: psycho-educative counseling, relaxation training, and
general as well as tinnitus-related stress management. In par-
ticular with regard to coping with tinnitus, their effectiveness
has been demonstrated in the above-mentioned studies.
However, these psychotherapeutic interventions are mainly

Abstract
The aim of this pilot study was the evaluation of the neuro-music therapy approach as a new treatment option for patients
with recent-onset tinnitus whose tinnitus symptoms were enduring after initial pharmacological treatment. In all, 15 patients
with recent-onset tinnitus took part in our manualized short-term music-therapeutic treatment. Tinnitus severity and
individual tinnitus distress were assessed by the German version of the tinnitus questionnaire (TQ) and the Attention and
Performance Self-Assessment Scale (APSA) at three different measurement times: baseline (T
0
), start of treatment (T
1
), and
end of treatment (T
2
). Score changes in TQ and APSA from start to end of treatment indicated significant improvements in
tinnitus-related distress. According to the Jacobson and Truax reliable change index (RC), 73.3% of the patients showed a
reliable reduction in individual TQ-score. The neuro-music therapy for recent-onset tinnitus according to the "Heidelberg
Model" introduced in this pilot study seems to provide an effective treatment option for patients with recent-onset tinnitus.

concerned with symptom management and are not intended
to cure the symptom.
Although the exact causes for tinnitus generation are not
completely understood yet, structural and functional altera-
tions of neuronal networks seem to play a crucial role. So
far, the research on neural changes associated with tinnitus
perception has focused almost exclusively on patients with
chronic tinnitus. Electrophysiological and neuro-imaging
studies in patients with chronic tinnitus give increasing evi-
dence of alterations both within the central auditory system
(Husain et al., 2011; Lanting, de Kleine, Bartels, & van
Dijk, 2008; Robert et al., 2010) and in nonauditory brain
areas (Landgrebe et al., 2009; Lanting, de Kleine, & van
Dijk, 2009).
Concerning the auditory pathway (e.g., dorsal and ventral
cochlea nucleus, inferior colliculus) and the central auditory
system, three neural mechanisms underlying tinnitus genera-
tion have been identified (Adjamian, Sereda, & Hall, 2009;
Eggermont, 2003, 2006; Norena, 2011): (a) increased spon-
taneous firing rate and hyperactivity of neurons in the audi-
tory pathway, (b) changes in the temporal firing patterns
resulting in an increased neural synchrony, and (c) reorgani-
zation of the cortical tonotopic map. Thus, tinnitus-related
brain changes are the result of an increased neuronal plastic-
ity, a form of "reprogramming the brain" (Bartels, Staal, &
Albers, 2007; Møller, 2006).
In recent neuro-imaging studies in patients with chronic
subjective tinnitus, the involvement of nonauditory brain
areas is moving more and more into the scientific focus.
These brain areas include structures involved in attention
and concentration such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC), the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; Vanneste et al., 2010;
Wunderlich et al., 2010) as well as areas of memory recollec-
tion and consolidation, such as the hippocampus and the
parahippocampal gyrus (Landgrebe et al., 2009; Vanneste
et al., 2010). Two highly integrative structures also seem to
be of importance for neural tinnitus generation: the insular
cortex and the precuneus (van der Loo, Congedo, Vanneste,
van De Heyning, & De Ridder, 2011). The involvement of
these manifold brain structures implies the existence of neu-
ral tinnitus networks with coactivation of tinnitus areas all
over the brain (Schlee, Hartmann, Langguth, & Weisz, 2009).
Within these networks special attention shall be given to the
limbic system, which may be responsible for the emotional
evaluation of tinnitus sounds. The amygdala in particular is
suspected of mediating emotional decompensation in chronic
tinnitus (de Ridder et al., 2006). Current research regarding
the role of the limbic system in the pathophysiology of tin-
nitus emphasizes that its influence is much more extended
than previously proposed (Leaver et al., 2011; Rauschecker,
Leaver, & Mühlau, 2010).
However, studies investigating neural changes in the case
of recent-onset tinnitus are still rare. Job et al. (2012) found
neural hyperactivities in attention- and emotion-related areas
especially in the insular, the prefrontal, and the ACC in mili-
tary adults with acute acoustic trauma and consequent tinni-
tus. The main objective of a recent study conducted by
Vanneste, van den Heyning, and de Ridder (2011) was to
investigate the differences of the neural network between tin-
nitus of recent-onset and chronic tinnitus. Their results indi-
cate that the neural structures detected in both acute and
chronic tinnitus were not only identical (comprising auditory
cortices, insula, dorsal ACC, and premotor cortex) but also
revealed differential activity and connectivity patterns within
this network.
Within the context of an increased understanding of neural
mechanisms underlying tinnitus generation, the need for a
new therapy approach based on neuroscientific findings
becomes apparent, especially for patients with acute tinnitus.
The neuro-music therapy for recent-onset tinnitus intro-
duced in this research paper strives for an integration of strat-
egies to manage the psychological state and possibly for a
restore of the underlying neurophysiological reorganization.
Complementary music- and psychotherapeutic interven-
tions were developed to intervene at different levels of the
neural tinnitus network: (a) a targeted auditory training
focusing on tinnitus processing in the central auditory sys-
tem, (b) techniques of auditory attention control and concen-
tration, as well as (c) psychotherapeutic intervention
strategies for enhancing emotional control of tinnitus. These
techniques and interventions were structured into modules
leading to a manualized short-term music-therapeutic treat-
ment concept (see "Materials and Methods" section for a
detailed description of this music therapy manual).
Previous studies demonstrated that in chronic subjective
tinnitus such an integrative music therapy approach, referred
to as the "Heidelberg Model of Music Therapy," has proven
to be an efficient means to reduce tinnitus distress and loud-
ness (Argstatter, 2009; Argstatter, Grapp, Hutter, Plinkert, &
Bolay, 2012).
The aim of this pilot study was to adapt and to evaluate
the neuro-music therapy approach as a new treatment option
for patients with recent-onset tinnitus after initial medical
treatment has failed.The specific interventions were expected
to be able to intervene at an early stage in those neuronal
processes leading to a chronic manifestation of the tinnitus
symptom. The efficacy of the therapy should initially be
reflected in a significant reduction of subjective perceived
tinnitus distress.
Materials and Methods
Patients
The pilot study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics
committee. To decide whether patients were eligible for our
study, they underwent some initial examinations. The inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1.
Grapp et al. 3
In all, 15 patients (7 woman and 8 men, 29-59 years old)
with acute tinnitus (6-12 weeks) were included in our pilot
study. They gave written, informed consent. Some important
demographic and tinnitus-related characteristics of the
included patients are provided in Table 2.
Measures and Covariates
Prior to music-therapeutic treatment, patients underwent a
standard audiological evaluation and otolaryngological
examination, including pure-tone audiogram, tympanometry,
otoacoustic emission, stapedius reflex tests, and vestibular
diagnostics. If these results were without pathological find-
ings, patients were included in this pilot study.
To investigate the patients' general mental state, the
German version of the Symptom Check List­90­Revised
(SCL-90-R; Franke, 1995) was used at the beginning of
treatment. The SCL-90-R helps to evaluate a broad range of
psychopathological symptoms. It contains 90 items yielding
nine scores of the primary symptom dimensions: (a) somati-
zation, (b) obsession-compulsion, (c) interpersonal sensitiv-
ity, (d) depression, (e) anxiety, (f) hostility, (g) phobic
anxiety, (h) paranoid ideation, and (i) psychoticism. The
arithmetic mean of these individual scales results in a global
severity index (GSI).
Tinnitus severity and individual tinnitus-related distress
were assessed by the German version of the tinnitus ques-
tionnaire (TQ; Goebel & Hiller, 1994) and the Attention and

Performance Self-Assessment Scale (APSA; Görtelmeyer,
Korbel, & Elkin, 2010).
The TQ consists of a total of 52 items. The questionnaire
records tinnitus-related complaints on a global TQ-score as
well as on the five subscales: (a) emotional and cognitive
distress, (b) tinnitus intrusiveness, (c) auditory perception
difficulties, (d) sleep disturbances, and (e) somatic com-
plaints. The range of values is between the minimum score of
0 and the maximum score of 84, whereas high values indi-
cate high tinnitus-related distress.
The APSA is a self-rating scale comprising 30 items. It
has been developed to measure especially attention and per-
formance problems in tinnitus patients. The range of values
for this questionnaire is between the minimum score of 0 and
the maximum score of 120. Higher scores indicate more
problems with attention and performance.
To measure and quantify therapy success, TQ-scores as
well as APSA-scores obtained at three different measure-
ment times (baseline [T
0
], start of treatment [T
1
], and end of
treatment [T
2
]) were compared. Statistical analysis was per-
formed by using the program IBM SPSS Statistics 20. Due to
the small sample size, the comparison of means at different
assessment times was conducted by the nonparametric
Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test for two related samples using a
level of significance of p value < .05. In addition, Cohen's d
effect size was calculated to measure the magnitude of the
treatment effect.
Changes in individual TQ-score were evaluated by the
reliable change index (RC) according to Jacobson and Truax
(1991). This approach allows for individual changes being
classified as reliable changes if they are unlikely to be due to
simple measurement unreliability. The RC is defined as the
change in a client's score (x
prae
­ x
post)
divided by the standard
error of the differences (S
diff
) for the test being used. Thus,
the formula for calculating the RC is
RC prae post

can be calculated from the standard error of measure-

If the RC is 1.96 or greater, then the difference is statisti-
cally significant at the .05 significance level. To compute the
RC for the global TQ-score, standard deviation and reliabil-
ity of the TQ manual (Goebel & Hiller, 1998) were used.
This yields a critical difference of 6.1 in TQ raw score which
equals a change of at least 8 percentage points.
Neuro-Music Therapy
According to the "Heidelberg Model"
The neuro-music therapy for recent-onset tinnitus is a manu-
alized short-term music-therapeutic treatment lasting for
10 consecutive 50-min sessions of individualized therapy.
Therapy took place in the German Center of Music Therapy
Research in Heidelberg on 5 consecutive days (from Monday
to Friday) with two therapy sessions per day. The comple-
mentary music- and psychotherapeutic interventions were
structured into the following modules.
Module 1: Psychotherapeutic Interventions
1. Counseling: All patients received a comprehensive
psycho-educative counseling to establish a cognitive
model of tinnitus. Patients were informed about the
underlying neuroscientific principles of the music ther-
apy. As the specific modules used in therapy were
based on the patients' individual tinnitus sound, their
"tinnitus-equivalent" had to be set up. For patients who
described their tinnitus as tonal, tinnitus frequency was
matched by a sine wave generator of the type
GwINSTEK SFG-2104 which produced pure sinusoi-
dal tones in Hertz. For patients with noise-like tinnitus,
the program "noise estimator" which generated noises
of diverse bandwidth and pitch designed by ©Dr.rer.
med. Christoph M. Krick, Neurocenter of the Saarland
University, was used to match the subjective tinnitus.
2. Individual Consultation: After the fifth therapy ses-
sion, a psychotherapeutic consultation took place to
review the course of treatment up to now. During this
consultation, patients could also talk about stressful
life situations or tinnitus-related fear for the future.
Module 2: Resonance Training
The Resonance Training was intended to increase blood cir-
culation of the entire head, especially in tinnitus-related
brain regions, and to innervate the auditory pathway via
somatosensory stimulation (Levine, Abel, & Cheng, 2003).
The patients learned a vocal exercise stimulating the cranio-
cervical resonating cavities.
To ensure that the Resonance Training was performed
correctly, the therapist palpated the nasal root, the frontal and
paranasal sinuses, as well as so-called "trigger points" on the
back (Alvarez & Rockwell, 2002).At these points, resonance
produces a clearly discernible vibration. During the interval
between the sessions, the patients had to exercise in
Resonance Training for 3 min every hour.
Module 3: Neuroauditive Cortex Training
The Neuroauditive Cortex Training used tone sequences cen-
tered around the transposed frequency of the patients'
Grapp et al. 5
previously determined "tinnitus-equivalent." These tone
sequences were performed live on a piano by the therapist
and had to be vocally imitated by the patient. At the begin-
ning of the intervention, the sequences consisted of only two
tones. With increasing difficulty, up to five tones were pre-
sented. The tone sequences should be atonal and performed
in quick succession.
A systematic and targeted training of inaccurately into-
nated musical sounds enabled the patients to exert influence
on their auditory processes as they learned to actively filter
out irrelevant information and to concentrate on relevant
acoustic stimuli. In addition to an increased auditory atten-
tion control, this training aimed at a neuronal reorganization
of the auditory cortex.
Module 4: Tinnitus Reconditioning
The Tinnitus Reconditioning offered coping mechanisms
related to stress control along with a sound-based habituation
procedure.
1. Relaxation training: As it was a well-known and
effective relaxation exercise, the music-therapeutic
relaxation training according to Bolay and Selle
(1984) was adapted to the needs of the tinnitus ther-
apy. By means of music as calming background
stimulus, the balance between the activity of the
sympathetic and the parasympathetic branches of
the autonomic nervous system should be restored.
The attention was diverted from the tinnitus, and
physical relaxation was supported. In addition, the
patients imagined a positive autobiographic episode
(e.g., reminiscence of a holiday experience) that
served as anchor stimulus: the retrieval of this
"well-being-imagination" should trigger bodily and
mental relaxation.
2. Habituation training: During the relaxation exer-
cise, the tinnitus sound was integrated intermit-
tently into the background music. The volume was
adapted to the individual hearing level compensat-
ing for a potential hearing deficit. For this purpose,
before the training session started, the patients had
to set the background music to a convenient level
such that they could easily listen to the music while
still being able to follow verbal instructions from
the therapist.
3. Stress management (Tinnitus Map): Subsequently
the patients had to set up a "tinnitus-map." This map
identified situations aggravating or intensifying the
tinnitus. These aversive situations were imagined
occasionally during the relaxation when instructed by
the therapist. The patients thus learned to decouple
tinnitus and aversive associations.
Results
Psychological Characteristics
of Acute Tinnitus Patients
To evaluate patients'general psychological distress, the SCL-
90-R questionnaire was applied prior to treatment. To enhance
the informational value and comparability of the results, indi-
vidual raw scores were transformed into standard T-scores
based on a German representative population sample (Hessel,
Schumacher, Geyer, & Brähler, 2001). The data revealed high
psychological distress in patients with recent-onset tinnitus:
12 out of 15 patients (80%) achieved T-values above the nor-
mal range on the GSI-score and on three or more subscales.
Besides the GSI-score (M = 63.3, SD = 9.78), the scales
Obsessive-Compulsive (M = 64.1, SD = 12.4), Depression
(M = 61.2, SD = 9.34), and Anxiety (M = 1.0, SD = 12.2)
reached particularly high values.
Therapy Outcome
Subjective Tinnitus-Related Distress. Score changes in TQ from
baseline to start of treatment as well as from start to end of
treatment are presented in Table 3. For a better comparison
of the single values, TQ raw scores were transformed into
cumulative percentages based on a German representative
population sample (Goebel & Hiller, 1998). The TQ-scores
indicated a slight improvement in subjective experienced tin-
nitus distress from T
0
to T
1
, even without any therapeutic
intervention. These improvements were primarily related to
the subscale Sleep Disturbances.
When, comparing TQ-scores at T
1
with TQ-scores at T
2
,
there were significant improvements in global TQ-score and
in all but one TQ subscales. The most notable changes were
achieved in the subscales Emotional and Cognitive Distress
and Tinnitus Intrusiveness. With the exception of Sleep
Disturbances, Cohen's effect size values exceeded d = 0.8
indicating large effects and a high clinical significance of the
intervention.
TQ-score changes on individual level were evaluated by
the RC. According to the formula developed by Jacobson
and Truax, a change that exceeds 8% can be regarded as reli-
able (see "Materials and Methods" section). Inspecting the
data, 4 of the 15 patients (26.7%) achieved a change smaller
than this. The lowest change was zero (for 1 patient) so there
were no patients with reliable deterioration and 73.3%
showed reliable improvement. The individual TQ-score
changes are displayed in Figure 1. Each point reflects the
scores of one patient: the x-axis is the T
1
(beginning of treat-
ment) score, and the y-axis is the T
2
(end of treatment) score.
Thus, points lying between the two dashed diagonals show
no reliable change and points below the lower dashed line
show reliable improvement.

Attention and Performance Problems. In addition to subjective
psychological and physiological-tinnitus-related distress,
almost all patients with acute tinnitus explicitly complain of
deficits in attention as well as concentration difficulties.
Therefore, the APSA was used as a complementary question-
naire to evaluate therapy success. A Wilcoxon signed-ranks
test indicated no significant APSA-score change from base-
line (M = 54.3, SD = 11.4) to start of therapy (M = 54.9,
SD = 9.85), Z = -.251 p = .801, d = .08. However, comparing
APSA-score at start of therapy (M = 54.9, SD = 9.85) versus
APSA-score at end of therapy (M = 48.6, SD = 11.5) revealed
a significant improvement in attention and performance
problems, Z = -2.98 p = .003, d = .83.
Discussion
The neuro-music therapy for recent-onset tinnitus according
to the "Heidelberg Model" introduced in this pilot study
seems to provide an effective treatment option for patients
with acute tinnitus after initial medical treatment has failed.
Both a significant improvement in subjective perceived tin-
nitus distress and a reduction in tinnitus-related attention
deficits are evident immediately after the treatment.
Moreover, the large effect sizes indicate a high clinical and
practical significance of the intervention.
The improvements in tinnitus-related distress (measured
via TQ) concern the patients' not only cognitive and emo-
tional dealing with tinnitus but also tinnitus intrusiveness
and auditory perception difficulties. It may therefore be
inferred that neuro-music therapy goes far beyond pure
symptom management. Instead, the individual treatment
modules are able to intervene at an early stage in those neu-
ronal processes leading to a chronic manifestation of the tin-
nitus symptom: On one hand, a controlled intervention into
the neuronal mechanisms of tinnitus generation in the central
auditory system is possible by means of "Resonance
Training" and "Neuroauditive Cortex Training," and on the
other hand, the ability of the limbic system to identify and
inhibit irrelevant sensory signals is thought to be strength-
ened through "Tinnitus Reconditioning."
Concerning changes in TQ subscales, it must be noted
that there is a significant improvement on the TQ subscale
Sleep Disturbances from baseline to start of therapy, even if
this single subscale has to be interpreted carefully due to its
small number of items. Poor sleep additionally increasing the
psychological strain is a common accompaniment of acute
tinnitus. The reduction of sleep disturbances prior to music
therapy may be explained by habituation mechanisms or by
the consumption of sleeping medication.
This pilot study continues the line of research evaluating
the effectiveness of the "Heidelberg Model of Music Therapy
for Tinnitus." Previous studies by Argstatter (2009) and
Argstatter et al. (2012) have shown that this integrative
music therapy approach is an efficient means to reduce tin-
nitus distress and loudness in patients with chronic tinnitus.
The data collected in this study allow for initial conclusions
that the "Heidelberg Model of Music Therapy for Tinnitus"
can be extended to the treatment of recent-onset tinnitus.
Apart from the successful therapy outcome, the majority
of tinnitus patients included in our study displayed a striking
profile of high psychological distress. In particular, depres-
sion and anxiety seem to be an intrinsic part of the everyday
life of most patients with acute tinnitus. These findings are
consistent with earlier studies indicating high prevalence
rates of psychiatric comorbidity among tinnitus patients
(D'Amelio et al., 2004; Gabr et al., 2011).
Asapilotstudy,oursamplesizeconsistingofonly15patients
was very small. Moreover, because there was no control
group of patients receiving no treatment, we cannot rule out
that other factors apart from the music-therapeutic interven-
tions had influenced the positive therapy outcome. To
strengthen our results, the neuro-music therapy approach for
recent-onset tinnitus will be reevaluated based on a wider
patient sample. In addition, two control groups will be
included in the study design: a waiting group and a group of
healthy controls.
This pilot study was based solely on questionnaire data
representing improvements in subjectively perceived tinni-
tus distress. However, as the proposed music therapy concept
focuses on neural mechanisms underlying tinnitus genera-
tion, a reduction in tinnitus distress should be reflected in
structural and functional alterations of the neural tinnitus
network.
Based on previous studies and relating to the expected
effects of the respective modules, we hypothesize that there
will be functional and anatomical changes (a) in primary
auditory areas due to the targeted auditory training, (b) in
brain structures involved in attention and concentration (e.g.,
DLPFC and VLPFC, ACC) due to the concentration training
and the increased auditory attention control, and (c) in limbic
areas due to increased emotional control of the tinnitus and
its aversive associations.
In our forthcoming study (ClinicalTrials.gov registration:
NCT01566708), task-based functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) will be used to test these hypotheses. We
expect to identify both relevant neuronal correlates of
tinnitus-related distress in the acute phase and changes in
neuronal activity from the start to the end of the treatment.
As an intrinsic noise cancellation system, the limbic sys-
tem plays a crucial role in chronic manifestation of tinnitus.
If the limbic filtering function is impaired, the evaluation of
the tinnitus sensation's perceptual relevance is affected and
the gain control of the tinnitus perception is disturbed. By
testing this model of Rauschecker et al. (2010) using fMRI in
patients with chronic tinnitus, Leaver et al. (2011) showed
functional and anatomical anomalies in limbic and primary
auditory areas. These anomalies were highly intercorrelated
indicating the importance of auditory-limbic interactions in
tinnitus. For further research, it might be of interest to con-
firm these results for recent-onset tinnitus, especially with
8 SAGE Open
regard to the question of how tinnitus develops into a chronic
condition.
In this pilot study, we reported a significant change in
tinnitus-related distress immediately after the treatment.
However, the neuro-music therapy strives not only for short-
term improvement but also and above all for a durable symp-
tom reduction. To investigate the stability of the therapy
outcomes, our future research will include systematic follow-
up examinations of the patients 3 months after the comple-
tion of therapy.
Another important aspect for future research is the com-
parison between patients receiving Psychotherapeutic
Intervention only, patients receiving Resonance Training
only, patients receiving Neuroauditive Cortex Training only,
and patients receiving Tinnitus Reconditioning only. Thus, it
can be investigated to what extent the individual interven-
tions contribute to the therapy success and if the interaction
of the single treatment modules is of particularly significance
for the effectiveness of the "Heidelberg Model of Music
Therapy" for recent-onset tinnitus.
Conclusion
The results of this pilot study show, in a small group of
patients, the efficacy of the neuro-music therapy for recent-
onset tinnitus according to the "Heidelberg Model." To con-
firm and to generalize these results, this treatment approach
will be reevaluated based on a wider patient sample and
compared with both a waiting group and a group of healthy
controls.
The neuro-music therapy is expected to intervene at an
early stage in those neuronal processes leading to a chronic
manifestation of the tinnitus symptom. Beyond a reduction
of subjective perceived tinnitus distress, a successful therapy
outcome should be reflected in alterations of the neural tin-
nitus network. In our forthcoming study, task-based fMRI
will be used to investigate neuronal correlates of tinnitus-
related distress in the acute phase and changes in neuronal
activity from the start to the end of the treatment.
