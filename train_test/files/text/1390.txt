Relationship of Serum Leptin Concentration With Bone
Mineral Density in the United States Population*
CONSTANCE E. RUHL1 and JAMES E. EVERHART2
ABSTRACT
Overweight is associated with both higher bone mineral density (BMD) and higher serum leptin concentra-
tions. In humans, little is known about the relationship of leptin concentration and bone density. We studied
this relationship in a large, national population-based sample. Participants included 5815 adults in the Third
U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988­1994) who underwent DXA of
the proximal femur and measurement of fasting serum leptin. Mean  SE BMD (gm/cm2) of the total hip was
1.01  0.005 in men, 0.94  0.004 in premenopausal women, and 0.78  0.007 in postmenopausal women.
Bone density increased with increasing leptin concentration in men (p  0.003), premenopausal women (p <
0.001), and postmenopausal women (p < 0.001). However, after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and
other bone density­related factors, an inverse association emerged in men (p < 0.001), being most evident
among men <60 years old. There was no association of leptin and BMD in premenopausal women (p  0.66)
or postmenopausal women (p  0.69) in multivariate analysis. Controlling for leptin had no effect on the
strong positive association of BMI and BMD in either men or women. Serum leptin concentration did not
appear to affect directly BMD. If present, the association appeared to be limited to younger men who are at
lower risk of osteoporosis. (J Bone Miner Res 2002;17:1896­1903)

INTRODUCTION
BEING OVERWEIGHT is associated with higher bone mineral
density (BMD) and decreased risk of fracture.(1­3) The
mechanisms responsible are incompletely understood, but
those proposed include muscle-mediated mechanical effects
of increased weight bearing,(4) increased aromatization of
androgen to estrogen in adipose tissue,(5) decreased sex
hormone­binding globulin with increased free sex ste-
roids,(6) and hyperinsulinemia.(7)
Leptin, the protein product of the obesity (ob) gene, is
synthesized and secreted by adipocytes, and serum concen-
trations are highly correlated with adipose tissue mass.(8­9)
Leptin binds to receptors in the hypothalamus and influ-
ences expression of several neuropeptides that regulate en-
ergy intake and expenditure. Although rare individuals with
extreme obesity are leptin deficient, most obese persons have
hyperleptinemia proportionate to body fat and appear to be
leptin resistant.(8) In addition to its role in food intake and
energy balance, leptin has been found to exert an influence on
a variety of endocrine axes, particularly on the hypothalamic-
pituitary-gonadal axis and on insulin metabolism.(10)
Although both BMD and serum leptin concentration are
increased with obesity, nonhuman models suggest that lep-

tin may be related inversely to bone density.(11) Obese
leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice have high BMD, even when
obesity is prevented by diet, while intracerebroventricular
leptin administration to these animals decreases bone mass.
In contrast, leptin reduced ovariectomy-induced bone loss
in rats.(12) In humans, the relationship of leptin concentra-
tion and BMD is unclear. No association of leptin concen-
tration with bone density, independent of overall adiposity,
was found in four small nonpopulation studies of middle-
aged or postmenopausal women using various definitions of
bone mass.(13­16) There was an inconsistent positive rela-
tionship of leptin with BMD at regional sites in premeno-
pausal but not postmenopausal women in one study(17) and
at one or more but not all bone sites in studies of nonobese
women(18) and postmenopausal women.(19) Bone density
was inversely associated with leptin concentration in a study
of men.(20) In a small, population-based study, leptin was
unassociated with BMD independent of fat mass in women,
and there was an inconsistent inverse relationship in
men.(21)
To examine the relationship of leptin concentration with
BMD in adult men and women, we measured serum leptin
concentration in a large, representative U.S. population
sample and studied its relationship with proximal femoral
BMD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) was conducted in the United States
from 1988 through 1994 by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). It consisted of an interview, an examination, and
laboratory data collected from a complex multistage strati-
fied clustered probability sample of the civilian noninstitu-
tionalized population aged 2 months, with oversampling
of the elderly, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Ameri-
cans.(22) The study was approved by the CDC Institutional
Review Board and all participants provided written consent
to participate.
Study sample
The sample for this study consisted of 2761 men, 1906
premenopausal women, and 1148 postmenopausal women
aged 20 years who were examined in the morning at a
mobile examination center after an overnight fast. Excluded
were persons who fasted 9 h (n  536) or 24 h (n  9)
or whose fasting time was unknown (n  129), those for
whom no serum specimen was available (n  732) or the
quantity was inadequate to perform the leptin assay (n 
11), pregnant women (n  105), and persons with missing
data on BMD (n  495). Women were considered to be
postmenopausal if they were 55 years (n  1052) or if
they had a uterus and at least one ovary, were not breast-
feeding, and reported not having had a menstrual period
during the past 12 months (n  96).
Variables
Total proximal femoral areal BMD (bone mass per unit of
area scanned) was measured by DXA (Hologic, Inc. QDR-
1000; Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).(23­24)
A morning, fasting venous blood sample was collected.
Serum specimens were stored at 70°C and went through at
least one freeze-thaw cycle during an average of 8 years of
storage before measurement of leptin concentrations. Leptin
has been shown to remain stable through five freeze-thaw
cycles(25) and after storage for as long as 29 years.(26) Serum
leptin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay
at Linco Research, Inc. (St. Charles, MO, USA).(25) The
minimum detectable concentration of the assay is 0.5 g/
liter. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation are both
5%.
Data were collected on factors known or thought to be
related to BMD based on other studies, including age
(years); ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican American, or other); education (less than high
school, some high school, high school graduate, some col-
lege, college graduate, or graduate school); body mass index
(BMI; kg/m2); cigarette smoking (never, former, less than
one pack per day, or one or more packs per day); alcohol
drinking (never, former, less than one drink per day, one to
two drinks per day, or more than two drinks per day); a
doctor diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart fail-
ure, stroke, chronic bronchitis, goiter, or other thyroid dis-
eases; use of adrenal corticosteroids or thiazide diuretics;
and for women, number of live births, a bilateral oophorec-
tomy, oral contraceptive use (never, former, or current), and
postmenopausal oral estrogen use (never, former, or cur-
rent).
A BMI change variable (kg/m2) was created by subtract-
ing one of the following measures from the current BMI:
maximum BMI (persons aged 20­25 years), BMI at the age
of 25 years (persons aged 26­35 years), or BMI 10 years
ago (persons aged 36 years and older). All BMI values used
in the calculation of the BMI change variable were based on
reported weights (reported weights were highly correlated
with measured weights,   0.98). A physical activity
intensity­level variable was created by summing the prod-
ucts of activity frequency in the previous month and an
intensity rating (or rate of energy expenditure, calculated as
the ratio of work metabolic rate to resting metabolic rate
[METs](27)) for nine common activities (walking, jogging or
running, bicycling, swimming, aerobics, dancing, calisthen-
ics, gardening or yard work, and weight lifting). Total
caffeine intake from beverages (mg/day) was calculated
based on 136 mg/cup of regular coffee, 64 mg/cup of
regular tea, and 46 mg/bottle or can of cola or soda.(28)
Daily food energy (kcal), protein (g), total fat (g), and
calcium (mg) intakes were calculated from a 24-h dietary
recall, as was daily calcium intake from supplements. Se-
rum vitamin D (ng/ml), thyroxine (g/dl), thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH; U/ml), and fasting insulin
(pmol/liter) concentrations were measured as previously
described.(29)

LEPTIN CONCENTRATION AND BONE MINERAL DENSITY
Statistical analysis
Because of differences in serum leptin concentration and
BMD, separate analyses were conducted for men and pre-
and postmenopausal women. Relations of leptin with con-
tinuous bone density­related factors were examined by cal-
culating weighted Pearson's correlation coefficients (). To
investigate the relation of leptin concentration and bone
density, we controlled for the effects of BMI and other bone
density­related factors using multiple linear regression
analysis. We examined the relation of bone density with
leptin concentration both by treating leptin concentration as
a continuous variable and by calculating mean bone density
estimates for leptin concentration quintiles. For the latter
analysis, leptin quintiles were categorized as indicator vari-
ables and mean bone density was estimated by least squares
means computed using SUDAAN PROC REGRESS (Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC,
USA).(30) The p values for trend in mean bone density
across leptin quintiles were computed by including leptin
concentration in the models as an ordinal variable of five
levels. Interaction terms for leptin and covariates were eval-
uated by adding them individually to multivariate models.
Because leptin concentrations were skewed to the right,
log10
transformation was performed to normalize the distri-
bution for regression analyses with leptin as a continuous
variable. Because of the large number of factors potentially
related to bone density, only those factors that were asso-
ciated with bone density in multivariate analysis (p  0.1)
were retained in the models to which leptin was added.
Multivariate analyses excluded persons with missing values
for any factor included in the model (numbers excluded for
men and premenopausal and postmenopausal women, re-
spectively, were 214, 227, and 210). A -coefficient with an
associated value of p  0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Analyses incorporated sample weights, stratifi-
cation, and clustering using SUDAAN software.(30)
RESULTS
Characteristics of men and pre- and postmenopausal
women in the study sample are shown in Table 1. Mean
BMD of the total hip was higher in men than in women and
higher in premenopausal women than postmenopausal
women (p  0.001). Conversely, mean fasting serum leptin
concentration was higher in women than in men and higher
in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women
(p  0.001).
Mean bone density increased with increasing leptin con-
centration in men (p  0.003; Table 2). However, after
adjusting for BMI, an inverse association emerged between
leptin concentration and bone density (p  0.001; Table 2).
The inverse association remained in multivariate analyses
controlling for BMI and age (p  0.001; Table 2) or BMI,
age, and other bone density­related factors (p  0.001;
Table 2 and Fig. 1). This inverse relationship was examined
further in subgroups based on BMI or age. The relationship
of leptin and bone density varied with level of BMI (test for
interaction, p  0.011). When examined by BMI subgroup
(normal weight, 25 kg/m2; overweight, 25­30 kg/m2;
obese, 30 kg/m2) in multivariate analysis, the inverse
association of bone density with leptin concentration was
limited to overweight men (p  0.004), and there was no
relationship in normal weight (p  0.52) or obese (p 
0.58) men (Fig. 2A). Interaction was also found between
leptin concentration and age (p  0.001). In multivariate
analysis by age group, the inverse association of bone
density with leptin concentration was found in young (p 
0.002) and middle-aged (p  0.003) men, and there was no
relationship in older men (p  0.27; Fig. 2B).
The effect of fasting serum insulin concentration on the
relation between serum leptin concentration and BMD was
examined in the subgroup of men without a doctor diagnosis
of diabetes. Insulin concentration was correlated with leptin
concentration (  0.64) and was strongly associated with
bone density (  0.049, SE  0.0066, and p  0.001 for
log-transformed insulin concentration [pmol/liter]). After
adjusting for other bone density­related factors, insulin
concentration was inversely associated with bone density
(  0.018, SE  0.0070, and p  0.012). However,
when insulin and leptin concentrations were included to-
gether in the multivariate model, insulin concentration was
not independently associated with bone density ( 
0.0038, SE  0.0088, and p  0.67) and had little effect
on the inverse association of leptin concentration with bone
density.
As expected, BMD was strongly associated with BMI
(  0.014 per kg/m2, SE  0.0012, and p  0.001 in
unadjusted analysis) and adjusting for leptin concentration
strengthened this relationship (  0.022 per kg/m2, SE 
0.0015, and p  0.001). This positive relationship of bone
density with BMI after controlling for leptin concentration
is also seen in Fig. 2A where bone density increased with
increasing BMI within each leptin concentration quintile.
Among premenopausal women, mean bone density in-
creased with increasing leptin concentration (p  0.001;
Table 2). After adjusting for BMI, an inverse association
was found (p  0.019; Table 2). This relationship was
diminished after controlling for age (p  0.076; Table 2)
and eliminated after adjusting for additional bone density­
related factors (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Among premenopausal
women without doctor-diagnosed diabetes, insulin concen-
tration was correlated with leptin concentration (  0.64)
and was strongly associated with bone density (  0.076,
SE  0.012, and p  0.001 for log-transformed insulin
concentration [pmol/liter]) but not independent of other
bone density­related factors (  0.016, SE  0.013, and
p  0.22). Insulin concentration had no effect on the lack of
a relationship between leptin concentration and bone den-
sity in multivariate analysis. As in men, BMD was strongly
associated with BMI (  0.010 per kg/m2, SE  0.00072,
and p  0.001) and adjusting for leptin concentration did
not diminish this relationship (  0.012 per kg/m2, SE 
0.0012, and p  0.001).
Among postmenopausal women, mean bone density in-
creased with increasing leptin concentration (p  0.001;
Table 2). After adjusting for BMI, no association was found
(p  0.16; Table 2). This relationship was unchanged by
adding age (p  0.24) (Table 2) or additional bone density­

related factors (Table 2 and Fig. 1) to the model. Among
postmenopausal women without doctor-diagnosed diabetes,
insulin concentration was correlated with leptin concentra-
tion (  0.64) and strongly associated with bone density
(  0.086, SE  0.011, and p  0.001 for log-transformed
insulin concentration [pmol/liter]) but not independent of
other bone density­related factors (  0.010, SE  0.013,
and p  0.44) and had no effect on the lack of a relationship
between leptin concentration and bone density. Among
postmenopausal women, there was a relationship between
leptin and bone density that depended on estrogen-
replacement status (p value for interaction  0.027). Thus,
on stratifying by estrogen-replacement status in multivariate
analysis, an inverse association of bone density with leptin
concentration was found among current users (p  0.013),
whereas there was no relationship among never users (p 
0.95) and former users (p  0.13; Fig. 3). BMD was
strongly associated with BMI (  0.014 per kg/m2, SE 
0.0010, and p  0.001) and this relationship remained after
adjusting for leptin concentration (  0.012 per kg/m2,
SE  0.0014, and p  0.001).
DISCUSSION
The results of this large, national, population-based,
cross-sectional study of adult men and women do not pro-
vide evidence for a direct effect of serum leptin concentra-
tion on BMD. In addition, leptin concentration does not
appear to mediate the positive relationship of BMD with
BMI. Among men, this latter relationship is seen graphi-
cally in Fig. 2A. Small studies of selected samples of
women(13­19) or men(20) and a smaller population study of
men and women(21) have, likewise, found no strong associ-
ations of leptin concentration with bone density. In mice,
leptin has been found to inhibit bone formation, acting
through a central control mechanism involving the hypo-
thalamus.(11) Obese, leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and leptin
receptor­deficient (db/db) mice have increased bone forma-
tion leading to high bone mass. The high bone mass phe-
notype cannot be explained by obesity alone and occurs
despite the negative influences of hypogonadism and hyper-
cortisolism. Intracerebroventricular leptin administration
completely reverses the high bone mass of ob/ob mice and

LEPTIN CONCENTRATION AND BONE MINERAL DENSITY
induces bone loss in wild-type mice. However, leptin and
leptin receptor­deficient mice represent extreme situations
in which there is a total loss of leptin function, which may
not be relevant to human populations. In obese humans,
high leptin concentrations can be associated with leptin
resistance because of impaired transport of leptin to the
hypothalamus. The lack of a direct correlation of leptin
concentration with bone density in our study and other
human studies may be caused by, at least in part, decreased
leptin function despite high levels that occur with leptin
resistance.(31)
Serum leptin and insulin concentrations are highly corre-
lated, and both have been considered part of the metabolic
syndrome and its attendant disease-related complica-
tions.(32) Insulin levels have also been shown to be related to
bone density.(7,33) However, in this analysis, insulin concen-
tration was not associated independently with BMD and did
not influence the relationship of leptin concentration to bone
density. Nevertheless, because of the limitations of a cross-
sectional study, we cannot exclude a relationship of leptin
and insulin to bone density.
In multivariate analyses, we found a negative association
of serum leptin concentrations with BMD in certain hor-
monally influenced situations such as younger men, who
have higher testosterone levels,(34) and postmenopausal
women on hormone-replacement therapy. Additionally, in
premenopausal women who would be expected to have high
estrogen levels, there was an inverse association indepen-
dent of BMI but not of additional bone density­related
factors (Table 2).
These intriguing findings that suggest a hormonally me-
diated relationship of leptin with BMD could not be eval-
uated further because sex steroid levels were not measured
in NHANES III. Nevertheless, other studies have suggested
a relationship that should be pursued. Among men, serum
leptin levels have been found to correlate negatively with
total and bioavailable testosterone levels.(35) Testosterone
appears to increase bone density in men.(36) It is possible
that the inverse association of bone density with leptin
concentration that we found in young and middle-aged men
was caused by confounding by serum testosterone concen-
tration rather than to an effect of leptin on bone density. In

addition, bioavailable estrogen has been shown to correlate
with bone density in men.(21,37) Among postmenopausal
women not on hormone-replacement therapy, serum leptin
levels have been found to correlate positively with bioavail-
able estrogen.(35) As with men, bioavailable estrogen has
been shown to correlate with bone density in postmeno-
pausal women.(21,37) Our findings in postmenopausal users
of estrogen-replacement therapy should be interpreted with
caution because of the small number of current postmeno-
pausal hormone users (n  104). The reason for the inverse
association of bone density with leptin concentration in such
women is unclear because hormone-replacement therapy
has been found to increase(38) or be unrelated to(39­40) leptin
levels.
Our study had other limitations. In NHANES III, BMD
was measured only at the proximal femur. We cannot ex-
clude the possibility of an effect of leptin concentration on
bone density at nonweight-bearing sites such as the spine or
radius. As with all cross-sectional studies, leptin was mea-
sured at one point in time, and bone mass is accumulated
and lost over a lifetime. Also, because of the cross-sectional
design, we limited our study to BMD, rather than fractures
that might have occurred many years before leptin measure-
ment. In addition, approximately one-third of participants
had to be excluded because they were not examined in the
morning after an appropriate fast or had missing data. Fi-
nally, the correlation of leptin concentration and BMI makes
their independent effects on bone density more difficult to
determine.
In conclusion, this study did not find a clear-cut associ-
ation of leptin with BMD. Importantly, leptin did not ex-
plain the association of BMI with bone density. We did find

younger men. Because younger men have a lower risk of
fracture, an effect of leptin on bone density does not appear
to have public health significance. Whether there is any
biological effect of leptin on bone density in adult humans
requires additional study.
