Background and Purpose--In the US, blacks have a higher incidence of stroke and more severe strokes than whites. Our
objective was to determine if differences in income, education, and insurance, as well as differences in the prevalence
of stroke risk factors, accounted for the association between ethnicity and stroke.
Methods--We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III), a cross-sectional sample of
the noninstitutionalized US population (1988­1994), and included blacks and whites aged 40 years or older with a
self-reported stroke history. Income was assessed using a ratio of income to US Census Bureau annual poverty threshold.
Results--Among 11 163 participants, 2752 (25%) were black and 619 (6%) had a stroke history (blacks: 160/2752 [6%];
whites: 459/8411 [6%]; P0.48). Blacks had a higher prevalence of 5 risk factors independently associated with stroke:
hypertension, treated diabetes, claudication, higher C-reactive protein, and inactivity; whites had a higher prevalence of
3 risk factors: older age, myocardial infarction, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Ethnicity was
independently associated with stroke after adjusting for the 8 risk factors (adjusted odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04 to
1.67). Ethnicity was not independently associated with stroke after adjustment for income and income was
independently associated with stroke (adjusted odds ratios for: ethnicity, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.49; income, 0.89; 95%
CI, 0.82 to 0.95). Adjustment for neither education nor insurance altered the ethnicity­stroke association.
Conclusions--In this study of community-dwelling stroke survivors, ethnic differences exist in the prevalence of stroke
risk factors and income may explain the association between ethnicity and stroke. (Stroke. 2005;36:1507-1511.)
Key Words: ischemia  risk factors  social class
In the US, blacks have a higher incidence of stroke, more
severe strokes, and higher stroke mortality than whites.1
These ethnic disparities have been attributed to higher prev-
alence or severity of stroke risk factors in blacks, biological
differences between blacks and whites, and lower socioeco-
nomic status in blacks compared with whites.2­4
Socioeconomic status may contribute to ethnic disparities
in stroke incidence and outcomes. Specifically, decreasing
socioeconomic status is associated with increasing stroke
incidence and stroke mortality.5 In the US, blacks have lower
average socioeconomic status compared with whites. For
example, the median 1999 family income for whites was
$53 356 versus $33 255 for blacks.6 Similarly, 9.1% of white
families lived below the poverty level in 1999, compared with
24.9% of black families.6
Previous studies have compared ethnic differences in
stroke incidence or stroke mortality and have found that
income explained a portion of the observed ethnic differenc-
es.7­9 However, these studies were limited by not accounting
for differences for known stroke risk factors.
The objective of the current study was to determine if
differences in income, education, and insurance, as well as
differences in the prevalence of stroke risk factors, accounted
for the association between ethnicity and stroke.
Materials and Methods
We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey
(NHANES III), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (1988 to 1994).10 This survey obtained historical, phys-
ical examination, and laboratory data on a nationally representative
sample of the noninstitutionalized US civilian population with
over-sampling of minorities.10 We included white and black partic-
ipants aged 40 years and older.

Definitions
NHANES participants were asked, "Has a doctor ever told you that
you had a stroke?" This self-reported stroke history was the
dependent variable for the current study. Self-reported ethnicity was
categorized as white, black, and other.
Income was assessed using the income to poverty threshold ratio
(IPTR). The numerator of the IPTR is the midpoint of the self-
reported family income category and the denominator is the US
Census Bureau poverty threshold for the year in which the partici-
pant was enrolled in NHANES.11 Participants were asked to sum the
income of all family members (eg, earnings, unemployment com-
pensation, Social Security).11 Each participant was assigned a
poverty threshold, which varies with the number and ages of family
members.11 Poverty thresholds are revised yearly to account for
inflation; therefore, poverty threshold values adjust for changes in
inflation between calendar years.12 Higher ratios indicate greater
income.
Educational attainment was examined in years of schooling.
Insurance status was examined using type of insurance and any
insurance. Because of missing values in the type of insurance
variable, any insurance was used in the multivariable analysis.
Employment was assessed by self-reported occupation and current
employment. Because of missing values in occupational category,
current employment was used in the multivariable modeling.
Data Analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute). Student
2-sided t tests were used to compare differences between dimen-
sional variables, 2 tests were used to compare differences between
categorical variables, and the Cochran­Armitage test was used to
assess trends across ordinal variables.
Multivariable Analysis Strategy
Our multivariable analysis strategy was developed to evaluate the
impact of income, education, and insurance on the stroke­ethnicity
association and involved the following 6 steps. In step 1, we used
forward-stepping multivariable logistic regression analysis to iden-
tify clinical factors that were associated with stroke, excluding
ethnicity, education, insurance status, and income to poverty thresh-
old ratio. In step 2, we used logistic regression to model stroke and
included the variables that were independently associated with
stroke (from step 1) and added ethnicity. In step 3, we used the
model from step 2 (including ethnicity) and added the income to
poverty threshold ratio. In step 4, we used the model from step 2
and added education. In step 5, we used the model from step 2 and
added insurance status. In step 6, we used the model from step 3
and added insurance status. We did not include education in step
6 because education was not independently associated with stroke
in step 4.
As part of step 1, the following stroke risk factors were evaluated:
age, sex, history of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood
pressures, history of myocardial infarction, claudication, congestive
heart failure, atrial fibrillation, treated diabetes, untreated diabetes,
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin sensitivity, current smok-
ing, tobacco use (pack-years), alcohol use, activity, body mass index,
waist circumference, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
These clinical factors were identified on the basis of clinical
judgment and previous research. Clinical significance was accepted
at an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.3 (for categorical variables) and
statistical significance was accepted at P0.05. Variables that were
associated with stroke, using both clinical and statistical significance,
were retained in the multivariable analyses. An events-per-variable
ratio of 10:1 was maintained in all models.13
Missing Values
Ethnicity, insurance status, and educational attainment were known
for all participants. Among the 11 163 subjects, the IPTR was
unknown in 1314 (12%). Subjects with unknown IPTR versus
subjects with known IPTR did not differ with regard to ethnicity
(black: 339/1314, 26% versus 2413/9849, 24%; P0.30), had a
greater prevalence of stroke (93/1314, 7% versus 526/9849, 5%;
P0.0098), were older (meanstandard deviation: 67.414.0 ver-
sus 62.114.0 years; P0.0001), were more frequently female
(784/1314, 60% versus 5130/9849, 52%; P0.0001), had higher
systolic blood pressure (meanstandard deviation: 136.320.3 ver-
sus 134.120.1 mm Hg; P0.0020), had greater prevalence of
claudication (425/1314, 32% versus 2918/9849, 30%; P0.043),
had greater prevalence of untreated diabetes (152/1314, 12% versus
963/9849, 10%; P0.0001), had higher HbA1c values
(meanstandard deviation: 5.91.2 versus 5.81.3; P0.034),
were less likely to smoke (234/1314, 18% versus 2178/9849, 22%;
P0.0004), and were less likely to be active (825/1314, 63% versus
7198/9849, 73%; P0.0001). No imputations were made for missing
values in the main analyses. When the mean value of the IPTR was
imputed for missing values, the results were essentially identical
(data not shown).
Results
Among 11 163 participants, 2752 (25%) were black, and 619
(6%) were post-stroke. There was no ethnic difference in the
stroke prevalence (blacks: 160/2752 [6%]; whites: 459/8411
[6%]); P0.48). The proportion of patients with stroke
decreased with increasing income (IPTR 1: 239/3279,
7.3%; IPTR 1 to 2: 193/2789, 6.9%; IPTR 2 to 3: 88/1811,
4.9%; IPTR 3: 99/3284, 3.0%; P0.0001). Participants
with stroke had lower educational attainment compared with
participants without stroke (meanstandard deviation:
9.24.1 versus 10.34.2 years; P0.0001). Participants
without insurance were less likely to have been told by a
doctor that they had a stroke than participants with insurance
(24/1307, 1.8% versus 595/9856, 6.0%; P0.0001). Cur-
rently employed participants were less likely to have a stroke
history (57/4629, 1% versus 562/6534, 9%; P0.0001).
Ethnic Differences in Stroke Risk Factors
Eight clinical factors were independently associated with
stroke: older age, history of hypertension, treated diabetes,
claudication, myocardial infarction, higher C-reactive pro-
tein, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and inactiv-
ity. Blacks had a higher prevalence of 5 factors: history of
hypertension, treated diabetes, claudication, higher C-reactive
protein, and inactivity. Whites had a higher prevalence of 3
factors: age, myocardial infarction, and high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (Table 1).
Influence of Income, Education, and Insurance on
the Ethnicity­Stroke Association
Table 2 provides the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for stroke
(adjusted for the 8 factors independently associated with
stroke) from the multivariable analyses evaluating the role of
income, education, and insurance on the ethnicity­stroke
association. Ethnicity was independently associated with
stroke when adjusting for the 8 factors that were indepen-
dently associated with stroke (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04 to
1.67). However, ethnicity was not independently associated
with stroke when income was added to the model (OR, 1.15;
95% CI, 0.88 to 1.49); income was independently associated
with stroke (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.95). Adjustment for
educational attainment did not alter the ethnicity­stroke
association and education was not independently associated
with stroke. Ethnicity was independently associated with

stroke after adjustment for having no insurance (OR, 1.30;
95% CI, 1.02 to 1.65) as was having no insurance (OR, 0.54;
95% CI, 0.33 to 0.90). Ethnicity was not associated with
stroke after adjustment for both income and insurance status.
In a secondary analysis, income and current employment
were forced into a logistic regression model with the clinical
factors associated with stroke: ethnicity was not associated
with stroke, but both income (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.99)
and current employment were (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.27 to
0.52).
Discussion
We found, in this sample of community-dwelling stroke
survivors, that ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence of
vascular risk factors and that income may explain the asso-
ciation between black ethnicity and stroke.
Three explanations have been proposed to account for the
excess stroke incidence and mortality in blacks: (1) blacks
have a higher prevalence or greater severity of stroke risk
factors; (2) biological differences; or (3) blacks have a lower
socioeconomic status (eg, inadequate access to care).14,15 The
current study does not specifically examine differences in
biology (eg, stroke subtype) between blacks and whites;
however, our data provide support for the other 2 hypotheses.
Previous research has shown that blacks have increased
prevalence of some stroke risk factors.16,17 Our finding of
ethnic differences in vascular risk factors, along with the
previous research, provides support for the hypothesis that
ethnic differences in stroke are caused in part by differences
in vascular risk factors.
In support of the hypothesis that ethnic disparities in stroke
are caused by lower socioeconomic status, previous studies
have demonstrated that lower socioeconomic status is asso-
ciated with increasing stroke risk.5,7,18­20 Similarly, we found
that low income was independently associated with stroke.
We were surprised by the finding that having insurance
was associated with a higher risk of stroke in this data set; we
offer 4 hypotheses to explain this finding. First, given the
cross-sectional design of the NHANES, no temporal relation-
ship can be established for the insurance­stroke relationship.
Some patients without insurance might have had a stroke and
then become eligible for disability insurance (thereby increas-
ing the association between insurance and stroke). Second, in
the US, there is a strong correlation between increasing age
and having Medicare insurance. Given the relationship be-
tween increasing age and stroke risk, the insurance­stroke
association may be confounded by age. However, because the
multivariable analysis included adjustment for age, this hy-
pothesis seems less plausible. Third, the insurance variable
we used was a crude measure (any versus no insurance) and
might not have adequately described a person's coverage for
or access to health care. Fourth, patients with insurance may
be more likely to have a physician and consequently more
likely to have stroke diagnosed.
One additional hypothesis requires examination, specifi-
cally that prejudice might contribute to ethnic disparities.21
Although numerous studies have demonstrated ethnic dispar-
ities in stroke incidence, outcomes, and care, these studies
have not attributed the disparities to prejudice. Our study was

not designed to examine prejudice, but future studies of
ethnic disparities should explore this hypothesis.
Limitations
We used NHANES data because it provided a large sample
and included a large subsample of blacks. Our results should
be evaluated within the context of 2 important limitations: the
NHANES sample included noninstitutionalized participants
and the NHANES data are cross-sectional.
Because NHANES includes only noninstitutionalized par-
ticipants, subjects with the most severe strokes are not likely
to be included. Specifically those patients with stroke who
died from their stroke or who required skilled nursing home
care would not be included. Similarly, stroke survivors with
impaired communication skills are also not likely to have
been included. Given that blacks have greater stroke severity
and stroke mortality than whites, it is probable that NHANES
under-represents blacks with stroke.22,23 Our finding that
stroke rates were similar for blacks and whites may be caused
by this sampling method. Future research should include
participants living in a variety of settings and should examine
incident stroke to avoid excluding patients who have died.
Another important limitation is that because of the cross-
sectional methodology used in NHANES, we cannot ascer-
tain the temporal sequence of the vascular risk factors or the
socioeconomic status variables and stroke. For example,
some of the clinical factors (eg, hypertension) that were
associated with stroke may have been identified after the
stroke. However, the vascular risk factors that were associ-
ated with stroke in the current study have all been associated
with stroke in other studies. The cross-sectional nature of the
data should be considered when evaluating the results that
describe the association between socioeconomic status and
stroke, because we do not know the participants' income,
insurance, or employment status before their stroke.
Because the NHANES did not include an assessment of
wealth (eg, owning property), our evaluation of socioeco-
nomic status was confined to income, education, insurance
status, employment, and occupation.
The primary outcome measure in the current study was
self-reported stroke history. Previous authors have demon-
strated strong agreement between self-reported stroke history
and medical record review.24,25 For example, the question,
"Have you ever had a stroke?" had a sensitivity of 95% and
specificity of 96% compared with a home assessment, clini-
cian interview, and medial record review.24 However, the
self-report stroke question used in NHANES does not discern
stroke subtype. Ethnic differences exist in stroke subtypes
incidence;17,26,27 however, our study is unable to examine the
role of socioeconomic status by stroke subtype.
We have described the subjects for whom the income to
poverty threshold value was unknown. Although missing data
might have biased our findings, it is unlikely to have had a
large effect given that the influence of the IPTR had a very
small or no effect on the ORs of the 8 factors other than
ethnicity in the multivariable models. Also, our results did not
change after imputing the mean IPTR for missing data.
We included white and black NHANES participants aged
40 years and older. Because cause and epidemiology differ
for stroke in young versus older patients, research that
focuses on stroke in adults often uses an age cutoff of 45
years and older.23,28,29 Given that blacks have an increased
risk of stroke at earlier ages than whites,30 we chose to use
40 years age demarcation to ensure that our sample in-
cluded adequate numbers of blacks with stroke. The 40
years age cutoff has been used by other studies about ethnic
differences in stroke risk.2,31
Conclusions
Given our findings that in a group of community-dwelling
stroke survivors, blacks had a higher prevalence of several
