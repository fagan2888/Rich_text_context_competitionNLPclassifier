OBJECTIVE -- To estimate the proportion of U.S. adults with diabetes who meet American
Diabetes Association (ADA) clinical practice recommendations.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Using data from the 1999­2002 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 998 adults aged 18 years with self-reported diabe-
tes were identified. The proportion of adults with diabetes meeting ADA recommendations for
HbA
1c
(A1C), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, renal function,
nutrient intake, smoking, pneumococcal vaccination, and physical activity was estimated.
RESULTS -- Among U.S. adults with diabetes in 1999­2002, 49.8% had A1C 7%; 27.4,
36.0, and 65.0% were classified as low risk for HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyc-
erides, respectively. Nearly 40% met blood pressure recommendations, 66% had normal renal
function, and daily nutrient recommendations for protein, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, and
fiber were met by 64.0, 48.3, 28.3, and 18.3%, respectively. Although 81% of the sample
reported not smoking at the time of the exam, only 38.2% reported ever having had a pneumo-
coccal immunization, and 28.2% reported getting the recommended level of physical activity.
Race, age, duration of diabetes, and education affected achievement of ADA recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS -- Achievement of ADA clinical practice recommendations is far from ad-
equate in U.S. adults with diabetes.
Diabetes Care 29:531­537, 2006
Control of blood glucose, obesity, and
hypertension has beneficial health
effects for diabetic individuals and
those at high risk for diabetes (1­4). Be-
havioral factors such as healthy eating,
avoidance of smoking, physical activity,
and weight control also have beneficial
health effects for people with diabetes and
those at high risk (4­8). However, some
of these risk factors are poorly controlled
in diabetic individuals (9).
Each year, the American Diabetes As-
sociation (ADA) publishes updated clini-
cal practice recommendations. These are
available in the public domain (10). For
public health planning purposes and to
more effectively allocate health care re-
sources, it is of interest to understand to
what degree diabetic individuals meet
specific clinical practice recommenda-
tions (1) and what clinical and demo-
graphic characteristics are associated with
reduced achievement of these recommen-
dations (2). The purpose of this report is
to define the proportion of U.S. adults
with diabetes who meet selected ADA
clinical practice recommendations. A sec-
ondary goal is to examine the association
between demographic and clinical char-
acteristics and achievement of ADA rec-
ommendations.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data on ADA clinical
practice recommendations are available
in the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) 1999 ­
2002.
Table 1 summarizes selected ADA
clinical practice recommendations that
were published in 2001 and the number
of NHANES participants for whom rele-
vant data were collected. We selected the
2001 recommendations because that year
approximates the midpoint of the period
of data collection for the NHANES data
used in this report.
Data source
NHANES is an ongoing data collection
initiative conducted by the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. NHANES
1999­2000 (11) and NHANES 2001­
2002 (12) are nationally representative sur-
veys of the noninstitutionalized civilian
population in the U.S. and were designed to
be concatenated and analyzed as a single
NHANES 1999­2002 survey (13). The
NHANES surveys are stratified multistage
probability samples based on selection of
counties, blocks, households, and the num-
ber of people within households. NHANES
1999­2002 was designed to oversample
Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic blacks,
and children and adolescents (13­15).
Laboratory determinations
NHANES examinations were conducted
either in a morning or afternoon session.
Participants in the morning session were

asked to fast for 9 h before the exam,
while participants in the afternoon ses-
sion were asked to fast for 6 h. Fasting
status was defined as self-reported fasting
of 8 h before the blood draw, whether it
occurred in the morning or afternoon ses-
sion. Relevant laboratory determinations
include glucose, HbA1c
(A1C), total cho-
lesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL choles-
terol, triglycerides, and urinary albumin
and creatinine. Data on glucose and total
cholesterol are reported for fasting partic-
ipants regardless of session, data on LDL
cholesterol and triglycerides are reported
for fasting participants in the morning
session only, and HDL cholesterol and
A1C data are presented for all diabetic
participants. A1C was measured only in
the 2001­2002 NHANES sample. Urine
specimens collected during the exam
were used to calculate albumin-to-
creatinine ratio.
Medical examination
Systolic blood pressure was measured on
the right brachial artery with the partici-
pant supine. Height, weight, and waist
circumference were collected according
to standardized methods. A detailed di-
etary assessment based on a 24-h food re-
call was administered. NHANES dietary
methodologies are designed to translate
foods into daily nutrient intake (16­18).
Household interview
Self-reported diabetes was assessed with
the question "Have you ever been told by
a doctor or health professional that you
had diabetes or sugar diabetes?"
Current smoking was assessed with
the question "Do you now smoke ciga-
rettes?" Participants who reported smok-
ing every day or some days were defined
as current smokers. Cardiovascular con-
ditions, including hypertension, conges-
tive heart failure, angina, myocardial
infarction, and stroke, were assessed with
similar questions, i.e., "Has a doctor or
other health professional ever told you
that you had congestive heart failure?"
The NHANES question related to
pneumococcal vaccination is phrased,
"Have you ever had a pneumonia vacci-
nation? This shot is usually given only
once in a person's lifetime and is different
from a flu shot."
The ADA recommends that diabetic
individuals follow the Surgeon General's
report on physical activity and obtain 30
min of moderate physical activity on most
days of the week (19,20). In NHANES, a
questionnaire assessed specific activities
performed on a voluntary basis, as well as
how often and for what duration these
activities were performed. Each activity
was assigned a MET (metabolic equiva-
lent) score (21), which was used to clas-
sify each activity into light, moderate, and
vigorous categories of physical activity.
Five or more moderate to vigorous activ-
ities or three or more vigorous activities
lasting for at least 30 min per week was
defined as recommended physical activity
(22).
Because of the relationship between di-
abetesanddisability(23­25),wereportrec-
ommended physical activity among
diabetic individuals who can exercise vol-
untarily. As a proxy for ability to exercise,
we used data on self-reported disability,
which are available for participants aged

20 years. Disability was defined as re-
porteddifficulty walking one-quarter mile
or walking up 10 steps without resting.
Statistical analysis
Means  SEs are reported for continuous
variables. Proportions and SEs are re-
ported for categorical variables. Analyses
focus on proportions of diabetic adults
meeting specific ADA recommendations.
We also present data according to race,
duration of diabetes, income, education,
and insurance status. The online appendix
(available at http://care.diabetesjournals.
org) contains detailed information on
data available for each of these subgroups.
For race, the 2 test was used with whites
as the reference group. For duration of
diabetes, household income, and educa-
tion, tests for trend were conducted using
logistic regression. The 2 test was used to
examine insurance status in relation to
ADA recommendations.
Data are weighted to the civilian non-
institutionalized population of the U.S.
Analyses include sample weights to adjust
for unequal probabilities of selection,
oversampling, and nonresponse. Analy-
ses were performed using SAS and
SUDAAN software. The complex sam-
pling design of NHANES produces means
and proportions that are potentially more
sensitive to sample size than conventional
random sampling designs. Design effects,
which measure the extent to which an es-
timate is influenced by the complex sam-
ple design, were calculated for all means
and proportions reported here (26). The
statistical reliability of reported estimates
was evaluated based on the design effects
and sample size according to NHANES
guidelines (13­15). Estimates that may be
statistically unstable are noted with an as-
terisk in the figure. These estimates
should be interpreted with the same cau-
tion with which a mean produced from a
simple random sample of n 30 would be
interpreted.
RESULTS -- The1999­2002NHANES
examination included 11,441 individuals
aged 18 years. Of these, 998 (482 in the
1999­2000 survey and 516 in the 2001­
2002 survey) reported having diabetes.
These individuals represent 6.3% (95%
CI 5.7­6.9) of U.S. noninstitutionalized
adults aged 18 years. Although the
mean age of the diabetic sample was 59
years, 10.4% of these individuals were
under the age of 40. Approximately half of
diagnosed cases were among women, and
nearly two-thirds of cases were among
whites. As expected, mean BMI (31.8 kg/
m2) and waist circumference (109.2 cm
for men and 105.8 cm for women) were
high.
More than half of adults with diabetes
reported hypertension, and cardiovascu-
lar disease was reported by 24% of these
individuals. Although 90% had insurance
coverage, approximately one-third re-
ported annual income of $20,000 per
year. Twenty-seven percent of diabetic
adults reported taking insulin, and 65%
reported taking oral hypoglycemic medi-
cations. Notably, 82% of diabetic adults
reported taking either insulin or oral
medication and 10.4% reported being on
combination therapy. Mean fasting glu-
cose was high (150 mg/dl) (Table 2).

Table 3 summarizes NHANES data
relevant to selected ADA clinical practice
recommendations. Although 50% met
the A1C target of 7%, nearly 30% had
A1C 8%. Similarly, only 27.4 and
36.0% of participants were in the low-risk
categories for HDL cholesterol and LDL
cholesterol, respectively. Findings were
more favorable for triglycerides: 65.0% of
the sample was in the low-risk category.
Clinical albuminuria was present in 10%
of the sample, and 24% had microalbu-
minuria. Forty percent of diabetic adults
met recommendations for blood pres-
sure.
Findings for dietary recommenda-
tions were mixed: while nearly 65% re-
ported recommended levels of protein,
only 18.3% reported getting the recom-
mended amount of fiber. Eighty-one per-
cent of the sample reported being
nonsmokers at the time of the interview.
Although 40% of the sample reported
ever having a pneumococcal immuniza-
tion, coverage differed substantially by
age: 12.4, 25.5, 46.7, and 65.5% of dia-
betic adults in the 18­39, 40­59, 60­74,
and 75 age groups, respectively, re-
ported pneumococcal vaccination. Only
28% of nondisabled diabetic adults re-
ported getting recommended physical
activity.
HDL targets appeared to be met more
frequently among blacks than whites and
Hispanics, but renal function and A1C
targets were met less frequently among
both blacks and Hispanics (Fig. 1).
Longer duration of diabetes was associ-
ated with poorer renal function, and peo-
ple who were newly diagnosed with
diabetes were much more likely to meet
the A1C recommendation than those with
longer duration. An unexpected pattern
of more frequent achievement of HDL
recommendations was observed with in-
creasing duration of diabetes. For blood
pressure and albumin-to-creatinine ratio,
higher income and higher educational
achievement tended to be associated with
more frequent achievement of recom-
mendations. There was a suggestion that
having insurance improved achievement
of practice recommendations for several
factors, but none of these relationships
was statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS -- These nationally
representative data demonstrate hetero-
geneity in achievement of selected ADA
clinical practice recommendations among
U.S. adults with diabetes and raise impor-
tant questions about how to most effec-
tively allocate public health resources
toward improved achievement of these
recommendations.
Only 49.8% of diabetic adults aged
18 years met the recommendation of
A1C 7%, a finding similar to a report
from NHANES III showing that the ADA
recommendation of 7% was met by
44.6% of diabetic adults aged 20 years
in 1988­1994 (27). Our findings from
NHANES 1999­2002 echo a recent re-
port using NHANES 1999­2000 that
made the important observation that gly-
cemic control has not materially im-
proved in U.S. adults with diabetes over
the last 10 years (9).
An NHANES III study highlighted
ethnic differences in glycemic control,
with black women and Mexican-
American men having worse control rela-
tive to other groups (27). Our data show
that black and Mexican-American dia-
betic individuals met A1C recommenda-
tions less frequently than whites.
Supplemental analyses of A1C data re-
vealed that white women met recommen-
dations for glycemic control most
frequently (59.5%), and Mexican-
American women met them least fre-
quently (39.6%). Other race-sex groups
were intermediate in their achievement of
glycemic control. Thus, with the excep-
tion of white women, glycemic control
recommendations are currently met by
less than half of all major U.S. race-sex
groups with diabetes.
Only 27.4% of diabetic adults met
recommendations for HDL cholesterol.
We observed a curious trend in HDL cho-
lesterol, with an apparent trend toward
greater achievement of target with in-
creasing duration of diabetes. In inter-

ADA recommendations in U.S. adults with diabetes

preting this observation, it is useful to
point out that fibrates (gemfibrizil and fe-
nofibrate) and niacin are the primary
drugs for treating triglycerides and raising
HDL cholesterol. However, niacin is rela-
tively contraindicated in diabetes and the
fibrates are underused because of the lack
of consensus on treatment of triglycer-
ides. This lack of consensus is due in part
to the discrepancy between ADA and Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Program
recommendations for treatment of tri-
glycerides (28).
Although 65% of the sample met rec-
ommendations for triglyceride levels, the
remaining 35% had triglycerides 200
mg/dl. A potential explanation for this ob-
servation is that the only studies investi-
gating triglyceride intervention at this
time were the Helsinki Heart Study and
the Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention
Trial (29,30). Neither was specific to dia-
betes, and the impact of triglyceride con-
trol on reduction of cardiovascular

disease was modest. No public effort to
lower triglycerides was ever undertaken
and might explain the relatively poor con-
trol of this risk factor in diabetic adults.
Notably, our data showed that more U.S.
blacks with diabetes met recommenda-
tions for triglycerides, with whites and
Mexican Americans meeting it less often.
This observation may represent differen-
tial representation of individual compo-
nents of the metabolic syndrome by
ethnic group, a notion confirmed by a
seminal report that showed less frequent
hypertriglyeceridemia and more hyper-
tension among blacks compared with
whites and Mexican Americans (31).
Ten percent of the sample had clinical
albuminuria. The relatively well-
preserved renal function is likely due to
the short mean duration of diabetes (11.5
years). The striking inverse relationship
between prevalence of normal renal func-
tion and duration of diabetes supports
this concept. Our data show that favor-
able renal function was present more fre-
quently in whites compared with blacks
and Hispanics among persons with at
least a high school education compared
with those who did not finish high school
and among those with higher incomes.
These findings are consistent with previ-
ous reports suggesting that diabetes com-
plications occur more frequently among
minorities and that socioeconomic indi-
cators are inversely associated with rates
of diabetes complications (32­34).
Only 19% of diabetic adults reported
being current smokers, a finding consis-
tent with an earlier report using data from
NHANES 1999­2000, which showed
that 17% of diabetic individuals were cur-
rent smokers (35). We postulated that the
relatively low prevalence of current
smoking among diabetic persons might
be due in part to a larger proportion of
diabetic individuals having quit smoking,
possibly due to recommendations for
smoking cessation among persons with
diabetes. Accordingly, we examined the
proportion of former smokers among
both diabetic and nondiabetic adults aged
18 years in the NHANES 1999­2002
sample. Indeed, among diabetic non-
smokers, 32.3% reported being former
smokers, compared with 24.5% former
smoking in nondiabetic adults. Our find-
ings are generally consistent with data
suggesting dramatic decreases in the pro-
portion of diabetic individuals who
smoke (35).
Although the low prevalence of cur-
rent smoking and the higher prevalence
of quitting among ever-smokers is en-
couraging, there is much room for im-
provement given that nearly one-fifth of
people with diabetes are still current
smokers. Perhaps more serious was our
post hoc observation that among U.S.
adults aged 18­39 years, there is actually
more smoking among diabetic (37.0%)
than nondiabetic (30.4%) individuals.
Thus, programs to enhance smoking ces-
sation among diabetic individuals are
needed, especially among younger adults
with diabetes.
Less than 40% of diabetic adults re-
ported ever having a pneumococcal vacci-
nation, a finding consistent with a Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention report
(36) showing that pneumococcal coverage
among U.S. adults with diabetes was
37.1%. The latter study demonstrated that
coverage was higher for older diabetic
adults compared with younger ones, an ob-
servation we confirmed in age-stratified
analyses with our data. This pattern likely
reflects successful public health education
aimed at the elderly, which also captures
some older diabetic individuals. It appears
thatadditionaleffortsareneededtoincrease
vaccination coverage among younger per-
sons with diabetes.
Finally, only 28.2% of nondisabled
adults with diabetes reported getting rec-
ommended levels of physical activity.
Identifying ways to increase physical ac-
tivity levels in diabetic adults is an obvi-
ous target for further study.
Achievement of ADA clinical practice
recommendations is far from optimal in
the U.S. Achievement of recommenda-
tions differs by age, race, duration of dia-
betes, and education. Public health
resources should be focused on enhanc-
ing empowerment of people with diabetes
to improve their diabetes self-manage-
ment skills and on identifying ways to im-
prove the efficacy of patient-physician
partnerships aimed at achieving practice
recommendations.
