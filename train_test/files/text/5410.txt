Most in the United States value marriage (McLanahan,
Garfinkel, & Mincy, 2001; Pew Research Staff, 2010).
Getting married remains one of the most important events in
people's lives (Owen, Lawton, & Vartanian, 2005).
Sociologists acknowledge the significance of becoming mar-
ried, yet know little about how relationships are transitioned
into marriage. Relationship models tend to portray relation-
ship transformation in fixed, universalistic, and static terms.
This study, using a constructionist approach, offers an origi-
nal process model that illuminates how engagement is
socially constructed and seeks to understand the meanings
engagement has in the lives of heterosexual couples. The
model focuses on interpretive practice, "the constellation of
procedures, conditions and resources through which reality
is apprehended, understood and conveyed in everyday life"
(Holstein & Gubrium, 2007, p. 10). From this angle, the
social context and reflexive interaction required to become
engaged are considered. Thus, sociologists are armed with a
more complex and contextualized understanding of how
relationships progress toward marriage.
The Literature on Coupling
Traditional research on coupling identifies social behaviors
that contribute to increasing levels of intimacy. Close roman-
tic relationships are linked to factors such as an increase in
self-disclosure in breadth and depth (Laurenceau, Feldman
Barrett, & Rovine, 2005; Lippert & Prager, 2001), increased
shared experiences (Aron, Norman, Aron, & Lewandowski,
2002; Werner & Haggard, 1985), shared intimate physical
spaces (Levinger, 1980), greater likelihood to discuss the
relationship, and more attempts to change the partner's
behavior (Argyle & Henderson, 1985; Haunani & Knobloch,
2001).
Traditional research makes inferences based on close-
ended surveys or behavioral data. This poses several prob-
lems. One, the researcher relies on a priori explanations for
relationship commitment and the researcher's definition of
commitment. These research methods do not take into
account how the couples themselves understand and inter-
pret their own relationship. Imposing preconceived notions
of commitment has proven problematic. Manning and Smock
(2005), for example, find that couple's interpretations of
what it means to cohabitate differ from researcher's that has
led to significant underestimation of cohabitation rates. By
examining couple's own understanding of relationships,
sociologists are in a position to ascertain not only a more
accurate picture of the state of the relationship but also how
these understandings affect the relationship. Participant's
definitions of the relationship are powerful influences on
commitment (Johnson, 1991; Orbuch, Veroff, & Holmberg,
1993).
Second, quantitative studies tend to portray relationship
progression as fixed and bounded events. Yet, qualitative

Negotiating Marriage: A Process Model of
Heterosexual Engagement
Tamara Sniezek1
Abstract
Based on data from qualitative interviews with 40 engaged heterosexual couples, this paper examines how couples transform
their relationship from "serious" to being "engaged to be married." Social Scientists have developed relationship models
designed to explain the transformation, but these models fail to adequately capture how couples transform their relationship
and the context in which this behavior occurs. Using a constructionist framework, an alternative process model is offered.
The five-process model captures the ongoing and fluid work couples perform to negotiate a redefinition of the relationship.
Couples reflexively use a host of complex symbolic interaction including talk, rituals, relationships with others, testing, and
use of time to construct their relationship in a new way. By examining the underlying reality construction process, rather
than merely looking at the outcome, the social processes and human actions that shape relationships are revealed.

studies show that these processes are gradual and boundaries
often blurry. Cohabiting couples rarely define a concrete
starting point for cohabitation and that progressing into
cohabitation is fluid and gradual (Macklin, 1978; Manning &
Smock, 2005). Qualitative studies of transitions out of rela-
tionships ("break-ups") also find the process gradual and
fluid (see Vaughan, 1986, also noted in Manning & Smock,
2005).
Third, the social context in which relationship transitions
occur are not adequately examined in quantitative studies.
For example, traditional research assumes couples live and
operate independently. Yet, couples often reside with other
adults, with children, and other roommates and these rela-
tionships greatly influence their relationship (Manning &
Smock, 2005).
Finally, traditional research relies on cross-sectional sur-
vey and behavioral data ignoring how relationships ebb and
flow over time. Relationship stage models, on the other hand,
attempt to address how coupling evolves. These models typi-
cally characterize relationships as developing through a
series of stages that become increasingly intimate and com-
mitted. In the Knox and Wilson (1981) model, engagement
follows three stages of dating: casual dating, regular dating,
and steady dating. The stage before engagement, steady dat-
ing, for example, is a period of serious dyadic exclusiveness.
Expectations that the relationship is exclusive are clear, if not
explicit. It is common to have tangible symbols of commit-
ment, such as living together or owning joint property.
Engagement differs from the "steady couple" in that there is
a public acknowledgment of their intentions to marry and
orientation toward wedding. Relationship exclusiveness is
surrounded by norms that are almost as strong as fidelity in
marriage.
The stage models, while useful, have limitations. Stage
models assume a clear-cut, unproblematic existence of a
shared definition of the relationship and engagement, ignor-
ing the process through which engagement is defined and the
relationship transformation recognized. Likewise, stage
models assume there is a linear progression from one set of
predictable behaviors to the next. The models do not describe
the process through which change occurs interactionally. For
example, how does the couple go from not having an orienta-
tion toward marriage to having one?
Recent research has begun to offer an insider perspective
of relationship changes and the social context of the relation-
ship that has led to a richer understanding of couple intimacy
and commitment. Couples weigh complex social factors and
social context when making decisions about and interpreting
their relationship. These factors have been documented and
categorized. Surra and Hughes (1987) identify four different
reasons commitment increases; intrapersonal-normative
reasons in which the relationship is evaluated by what they
think ought to occur in "normal" relationships, dyadic rea-
sons that reference interaction between partners, social net-
work reasons that reference interaction with family,
coworkers, friends, and so on, and circumstantial reasons
that reference "timing." Similarly Orbuch et al. (1993) finds
similar diversity and contextual accounts for couple intimacy
that include positive romantic themes, positive nonromantic
themes and pragmatic reasons.
Qualitative analysis has uncovered situational social fac-
tors that shape the development of the relationship.According
to Richardson (1988), the social conditions surrounding the
secret affairs between married men and single women pro-
duce intense intimacy. The man's marital status, for instance,
is structurally conducive to idealization of the relationship
and the secrecy of the relationship means it is not socially
tested and thereby longer lasting. The importance of struc-
tural factors and particularly the role of economic resources
are revealed in several recent qualitative studies. Low income
participant's understandings of socially acceptable levels of
financial security heavily shape their decisions about marry-
ing their partner (Gibson-Davies, Edin, & McLanahan, 2005;
Reed, 2006, Sassler & Cunningham, 2008; Smock, Manning,
& Porter, 2005). Geography shapes the orientation and length
of time one becomes married. Rural couples move more
quickly into marriage and spend less time preparing for
adulthood than urban couples. Urban couples spend more
time attempting to achieve economic stability, emotional
maturity, and thoroughly testing a relationship (Kefalas,
Furstenberg, Carr, & Napolitano, 2011). Gender shapes
expectations about who should propose marriage and the
meanings of cohabitation (Sassler & Miller, 2011). Women
are more likely to feel that cohabitation expresses relation-
ship commitment and is leading to marriage (Huang, Smock,
Manning, & Bergstrom-Lynch, 2011).
A Natural History Approach to Engagement
Qualitative research has widened Sociologist's understand-
ing of the social context and meanings of intimacy and com-
mitment. What is distinctly missing from the literature is a
natural history approach, whereby the researcher examines
the coupling processes and how it unfolds over time, espe-
cially as it relates to becoming engaged. Sociology's use of a
natural history method dates back to the early ethnographies
of the Chicago School (see Shaw's, 1931, classic The Natural
History of a Delinquent Career). A natural history approach
attempts to uncover the full set of unfolding events and their
critical social context. Chicago School's Robert E. Park's
(1923) natural history of the newspaper, for example, exam-
ines the social processes over time that gave rise to the mod-
ern newspaper. Stage models offer an examination of the
unfolding relationship, but are missing the critical contextual
process. For example, how are couples progressing from one
stage to another? What are the circumstances that trigger a
change and what are the processes they use to make the
change? These critical social processes behind relationship
transitions are missing from longitudinal studies. Natural
history analysis of coupling is sparse and focused on
Sniezek 3
psychological drives. Goldsmith (1990) describes the natural
history of coupling as a series of ongoing dialectical tensions
between partner's needs for autonomy and connection. In the
beginning of a relationship, for example, tensions arise con-
cerning whether to become involved in a relationship and
weighing the relationship in terms of meeting needs for con-
nection versus needs for autonomy. Goldsmith's concentra-
tion on the two opposing psychological needs oversimplifies
the complex range of factors operating on the couple. The
needs of the couple appear to drive and direct the coupling
rather than the participants actively creating it.
Ironically, there is more extensive natural history research
related to uncoupling, that is how couples make transitions
out of intimate relationships. Vaughan (1986) finds that
uncoupling is a definitional process that occurs gradually
and fluidly, beginning in private and becoming increasingly
public. Does coupling unfold similarly, but in reverse?
This study offers an original contribution to the literature
on marriage and intimacy by examining the social construc-
tion of engagement. Engagement is typically conceptualized
as an isolated moment in which a formal promise of marriage
is offered. Few, if any, studies have examined engagement as
a fluid and ongoing process. I offer an original approach to
engagement, wherein engagement is viewed as a definitional
process that participants use to collaboratively construct a
new identity and intertwined social worlds. The process
requires a myriad of actions by participants, with each other
and with outsiders over an extended period. I have developed
a natural history process model of the engagement process.
This model, unlike the previous models of relationships, does
not assume the participants engage in a predictable set of
behaviors with each new process. By focusing on the process,
rather than the product, this model appreciates the variation
and context in which a variety of behaviors occur. For exam-
ple, a couple may define themselves as engaged through elab-
orate rituals that include presenting a ring on bended knee.
Yet, another couple defines themselves as engaged only when
they complete social markers such as obtaining their college
degree or acquiring a particular job. Yet some couples are
engaged after a discussion about the relationship. Stage mod-
els identify patterns of linear behaviors, making assumptions
that couples pass through each stage in a particular order and
displaying behavior particular to that stage. A process model
does not focus on the behaviors unique to a particular mar-
riage path. Instead, it looks at various ways transformations
are accomplished. The model does not automatically assume
a linear progression from one process to another. While in the
ideal form, couples progress from one process to another, at
any point in time the couple relationship can come to a halt,
can revert to a previous process, or skip ahead to an entirely
new process. This model appreciates and examines how these
contingencies get attended to and are meaningfully under-
stood. Whether a couple is one process or another may be
unclear. This presents a problem for the stage model of rela-
tionships as it is difficult to categorize the participants'
behavior into the proper stages. However, in the process
model, behavior that is unclear is the very sorts of behavior
that this model examines. For example, in the early stages of
engagement it is often unclear if the desire to become engaged
is mutually held. The stage model would likely gloss over this
because it focuses on the behaviors that lead to intimacy and
the order in which those behaviors occur. The process model
would hone in on those moments when the behaviors that
lead to intimacy are vague and complex. How the participants
make sense of and interpret behaviors from their partners that
are usually indirect, unclear, and even contradictory have to
be sorted out by the participants themselves. This model
examines such work shedding light on how couples make
sense of and navigate their way through complex and often
fuzzy relationship changes. Stage models categorize and
group behavior commonalities, rather than examining the
varied and contextual work required.
The study asks, how do couples come to understand that
they want to be engaged, become engaged, and be engaged?
When and how do thoughts and/or talk of marriage arise in
couple's relationship and how does the prospect of engage-
ment and being engaged evolve over time? These questions
are answered by analyzing the development of such thinking
and talk, seeking initially to identify the moments and occa-
sions when the first hints of marriage arise between the part-
ners and subsequently, following the couple's social path to
engagement. A priori definitions of engagement are avoided
and instead participants are asked how and when marriage
becomes an important and relevant phenomenon in the ongo-
ing relationship. In this way an understanding of how mar-
riage is meaningfully invoked by, and relevant to, the couple
themselves is achieved. Drawing on Charmaz' (2000)
grounded theory approach, an emphasis on keeping the par-
ticipant's words and meanings intact in the process of analy-
sis (i.e., their wording is abundant in memos/analysis) is
attempted, therefore maintaining the participants' presence
throughout, with the goal to communicate how participants
construct their worlds.
Data and Method
This article is based on data gathered as part of a larger study
on weddings. The wedding study initially focused on wed-
ding planning and ceremonies. In gathering background data
on the couple's relationship, a few interview questions were
included regarding the couple's dating and engagement
experience. The initial interview data were so promising that
the study was expanded to explore the engagement process
more fully. This article is based on the expanded interview
data on engagement.
The research was originally a dissertation study that
included qualitative interviews with a snowball sample of 20
heterosexual couples marrying for the first time. These were
collected 1998 through 2001. The first 4 participants were
recruited at a southern California University through mutual
4 SAGE Open
acquaintances. Referrals were requested from these partici-
pants and led to 16 additional participants from other areas of
the southern California region and beyond the university.
The dissertation research was expanded to include an addi-
tional 20 couple interviews, 10 added 2003-2005 from cen-
tral California. The first 6 interviews were initially recruited
from a popular local wedding venue. Those participants were
asked for referrals that led to an additional 4 interviews with
couples using other wedding sites. Another 10 interviews
were added recently from central California in 2011 for a
total of 40 couples. The initial 2011 couples were recruited
from a local university. They provided referrals that broad-
ened the diversity of the sample. Thirty-seven of the couples
were drawn from a snowball sample of recently engaged
couples that initially were people known to the researcher or
by someone who knew the researcher. It should be noted that
3 couples were referred from a professional wedding plan-
ner. In the course of conducting wedding research, a southern
California wedding planner became known to the researcher
and a source that referred 3 of her clients.
Criteria for inclusion in the study were those couples who
were getting married for the first time, childless, heterosex-
ual, and their engagement was successful meaning they did
get married (as opposed to calling the engagement perma-
nently off). In many ways, the couples in this sample are the
stereotypical "engaged couple" celebrated in popular cul-
ture. The study was intentionally built on the fairly homoge-
neous and "typical" couple first to lay out the foundations of
the coupling process. It is acknowledged, however, that more
diverse groups, such as second-time marriages or gay cou-
ples, which are increasingly common, would complicate,
enhance, and perhaps challenge the model. Thus, the model
serves as a foundational starting point that is meant to be
refined with future research.
There is a wide time gap between the initial interviews
and the expanded interviews, providing the opportunity to
create a model that fits couple's experience from different
time periods. A process model was created after the first 20
interviews, but refined with the addition of each subsequent
interview until theoretical saturation (see Glaser & Strauss,
1967) was achieved. Couple's engagement experiences dif-
fered little between time periods. Two differences were
noted. There were four couples who met through online dat-
ing services in the 2011 sample and only one in the 2005 and
none in 1998. Likewise, the 2011 couples mentioned watch-
ing television programs about weddings (i.e., Bridezilla or
Say Yes to the Dress) that earlier participants did not men-
tion. These differences, however, did not inherently change
the intimacy model.
A natural history method of interviewing was used to
uncover the social construction process. Questions began
with the earliest moments in their relationship ("When did
you meet and how?") and how the relationship progressed
from there ("When did you see a change in the relationship
and how did that happen?"). A natural history approach
provided contextualized data on how engagement unfolded
and progressed.
Two types of interviews were performed. Ten couples
participated in what was referred to as extensive longitudinal
interviews. These included an initial interview conducted as
early in the engagement process as possible, follow-interviews
in regular intervals during wedding planning, about every
2 months until the wedding, field interviews at the wedding
ceremony and celebration and, at least, one postwedding
interview. These couples participated in as many as six inter-
views. The wedding and postwedding data were part of the
larger study on weddings and was, in part, to explore other
wedding-related themes. However, wedding and postwed-
ding interviews were an opportunity to ask how "being mar-
ried" was different from "being engaged" and how, yet again,
their relationship was transformed by this new stage. Of the
remaining 30 couples all were interviewed, at minimum, 2
times, once before the wedding and once after. In all, 19 cou-
ples were interviewed 2 times and 11 couples were inter-
viewed 3 times. While much of the data on engagement were
gathered in the initial interviews, subsequent interviews
allowed follow-up questions and explored themes that
emerged during ongoing data coding. During engagement up
until the wedding, couples were interviewed as many times
as could be arranged. However, interviews were extensive
and time-consuming (2-3 hr long). Thus, it was not always
possible to interview each couple more than once during the
engagement period. But, additional interviews were
attempted when possible. There was no attrition as all of the
couples maintained their participation in the study.
Couples were interviewed together, most often, in the first
interview and in the postwedding follow-up. In follow-up
interviews partners were interviewed separately where pos-
sible. Separate interviews provide the opportunity to under-
stand engagement from each of the partner's viewpoint.
Likewise, answering questions outside the partner's presence
may reveal information about couple differences, perspec-
tives, and tensions that might not arise if interviewed jointly.
Conversely, interviewing the couple together made possible
the revelation of joint perspectives. Often during the inter-
view the couple sorted through and negotiated joint perspec-
tives. Thus, the joint interview afforded a firsthand look at
couple's joint reality production. The inclusion of separate
and joint interviews provided a variety of information and
perspectives. When couple interview data on a given topic
differed from individual interview data, it was noted and ana-
lyzed. It was discovered that couples displayed sensitivity
toward staying in synch with their partner's views and per-
spectives and actively worked to produce similar accounts
whether they were interviewed together.
Sample Description
The study consisted of 5 African Americans, 8 Asians, 21
Latinos, and 46 Whites (80 individuals total/40 couples). The
Sniezek 5
median age of the men was 27.1 and women 26.2 (this
closely matches national-level statistics of first-time mar-
riage; U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). The education level of the
sample was fairly high. Three of the subjects were in gradu-
ate school and 30 others had achieved, at least, a bachelor's
degree. The remaining 27 had a high school diploma. Every
individual was employed in the paid workforce and most of
the sample worked full-time. Five participants, 1 male and 4
females, were employed part-time. A substantial portion of
the sample were cohabitating before marriage, nearly 65%.
(This also is very close to national practice as current research
suggests approximately 70% of first marriages are preceded
by cohabitation; Kennedy & Bumpass, 2008.) The sample
had a fairly equal proportion of working and middle class.
There were no participants that would be considered poor or
upper class ("the 1%"). The sample is not statistically repre-
sentative, but useful for uncovering processes. The researcher
is making insights into particular social and familial pro-
cesses within a specific location and context. Sampling for
this study followed the principles of saturation (Glaser &
Strauss, 1967) whereby the sample size was adequate when
the collection of new data did not shed any further light on
the issue under investigation.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach
(Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Data collection was maintained
simultaneously with the analysis phases of research. Early in
the collection of interviews, open coding (see Emerson,
Fretz, & Shaw, 1995) of transcripts was undertaken to
uncover emerging themes and questions. With regard to cou-
pling, for example, initial coding revealed what appeared to
be patterns regarding the progression of the relationship.
Interviews were tailored to explore these emerging patterns.
In early interviews that did not include explicit questions
related to emerging themes, follow-up interviews were
designed to make this information explicit. As data collec-
tion continued, focused coding, "fine-grained, line-by-line
analysis of the notes building up and elaborating analytically
interesting themes" (Emerson et al., 1995, p. 160) was under-
taken. Eventually, interviews and field note analysis pro-
gressed to linking coded data and analytical themes together.
This analysis was written up in what Emerson et al. (1995)
refer to as integrative memos. This article is based on several
integrative memos on the engagement process. Couples are
referred to by pseudonyms and any information identifying
them has been modified to protect their identity.
Findings
One couple defines themselves as engaged through a series
of ongoing mundane conversations, while another is engaged
through a highly ritualized and public proclamation. At first
glance, the process appears idiosyncratic. Efforts were made
to disentangle couple's experiences looking for underlying
patterns across cases.
In general, couples approach marriage delicately and indi-
rectly. Assessing the marriage potential and introducing the
prospect of marriage to one's partner is a difficult and uncer-
tain process. Hinting, testing, joking, and scrutinizing the
partner's behavior are commonplace. Furthermore, the pro-
cess is characterized by ongoing negotiation. Participants
work together for months, sometimes years, to coordinate
joint definitions of the relationship and transition themselves
into being an engaged couple. The following is a model that
illuminates these processes and how they unfold over time.
The model consists of a series of five processes that grow
increasingly public. The processes are not fixed stages.
Couples may be in more than one process at a time, may fail
to progress in a linear fashion and jump back to a previous
process and/or widely vary in the length of time in any one
process.
Process One: Assessing the Relational Future
According to Morton, Alexander, and Altman (1976), cou-
ples in romantic relationships, in all levels of intimacy, con-
tinually assess their ongoing relationship. Each party asks,
what is the nature of our current relationship? What is the
future of our relationship? Stage models confirm that assess-
ment happens in the early stages of engagement but stage
models give no sense of how participants decide if the rela-
tionship is "the one." Alternatively, the process model
describes what the assessment process looks like and how it
is made. The partners make an assessment about whether the
partner is a desirable person to marry and whether the desire
to marry is mutually held. Participants use verbal and non-
verbal cues gleaned from the partner and the social world
around them to make sense of and understand the marriage
potential of the relationship.
The marriage assessment process begins in recognizing
the partner as "the one"--the person one desires to marry. For
some this is a long and difficult process and for others it is
quite short and simple. Compare the following two accounts:
I mean we knew right away. We had been close friends for--
before we got together. And almost immediately (within 1 week)
it was like this is it. We both knew. (Randy)
So I wasn't sure if I was ready to settle down and I didn't want
to regret not ever dating other people later on. So, I--when I
went to study abroad I said let's just date other people. I need to
be sure . . . When I came back (1 year later) things--we got back
together and I felt okay I'm ready. (Betty)
Betty's case exemplifies how difficult recognizing the
marriageability of the partner may be. Participants rely on
vague internal cues to guide them. Betty comes to under-
stand the problem of "knowing" occurring because she lacks
6 SAGE Open
dating experience. Gaining dating experience will help her to
recognize and "know" Sam is the one.
Betty's view, however, is not shared by everyone. There
are a variety of methods couples use to "know." These meth-
ods are not determinative of conduct, but are a resource par-
ticipants can reflexively draw on (Zimmerman & Pollner,
1970). In Maria's case, knowing is accomplished through
interaction with others.
My friends started saying things like, "I've never seen you this
way. You must be in love. Are you going to get married?" I don't
know, until then, I hadn't really thought of our relationship that
way. (Maria)
Participants also rely on common sense notions about
how one feels and behaves toward the person who is "the
one." Having powerful feelings toward the other person
("I've never felt this way about anyone before"), sharing
commonalities with the partner ("I just thought that we had
so much in common"), and seeing the partner as possessing
a great deal of desirable traits ("He's so honest. The most
honest person I've ever met") are a few of the ways partici-
pants recount having come to assess the partner as marriage
desirable.
In addition to internal factors (feelings, commonalities,
etc.), life circumstances are important. Moving in together,
graduating from college, reaching a certain age, and the
amount of time dating the partner are used to make sense of
the marriage potential of the relationship. For Maggie, a
combination of internal factors and life circumstances help
her make sense of her desire to marry her partner.
I just thought that we had so much in common, we really liked
each other. And I think it's an age thing for me, where I feel like
I'm working full-time now you know, I like my boyfriend; you
what else is there to do? I know that doesn't sound romantic, but
I think that happens a lot. (Maggie)
Some participants, after a struggle to determine if their
partner is "the one," quickly reach the conclusion that they
want to marry the partner or that, at the very least, they would
like marriage with this partner to occur sometime in their
future. However, other participants do not immediately reach
this conclusion. Their feelings remain unclear. It is not until
later, after direct verbal conversations and/or continual
assessment of their relationship occurs, that the feelings
become increasingly specified and clarified.
The participant's accounts, internal and external factors,
highly resemble the four major reasons given by the partici-
pants in Surra and Hughes (1987)'s study of commitment
processes. But, unlike the Surra and Hughes analysis, the
present research explores a wider range of social behavior
including thoughts, talk, actions, and interaction that went
into the process. The "reasons" for deciding on commitment
were accompanied by and shaped by testing, hinting, talking,
negotiating, and a host of other interactional tools.
Furthermore, the reasons participants give would ebb and
flow as the relationship evolved. The process of relationship
transition is uncertain as the signs and signals they are rely-
ing on are vague and indirect. Efforts must be made to render
vague signs "seeable" and "knowable."
Women participants report being the first to make attempts
to interpret and assess the ongoing relationship. Of the 40
women, 38 in the sample reported being the first to assess the
marriage possibility of the relationship and 36 men reported
that their thoughts of marriage occur after the issue is first
raised by their female partner. Sassler and Miller (2011) find
that men are more likely to initiate the decision to date and men
and women equally likely to initiate cohabitating. My findings,
interpreted in light of Sassler and Miller's findings, show that
as commitment increases and veers toward marriage, women
become more active in the initiation process. This reflects
social and cultural norms that encourage women's energies and
desires to be toward marriage. In contrast, early dating and
cohabitating, where sanctioned commitment is less required,
men are socially allowed more involvement.
The first partner to assess the marriage relationship must
interpret what their partner's feelings and intentions regard-
ing marriage might be. Participants assess whether the part-
ner's view of the relationship is in synch with theirs in
primarily two ways. One, they rely on reading verbal and
nonverbal cues from the partner and others in their social
world. Two, the participants may work to make the informa-
tion "seeable" by testing the partner's feelings for them. This
work is often subtle and behind the scenes. Sassler and Miller
(2011) find that in deciding to date and move in together
strategies are also indirect. However, they find the indirect
attempts are almost entirely used by women. In this study,
men also use indirect approaches. The process of initiating a
change in the relationship is risky for both men and women.
Rejection in and of itself may be painful, but it also leaves
the couple out of synch in their definitions of the relation-
ship, potentially threatening the relationship. Thus, the initia-
tor has, most assuredly, done work to determine that marriage
is mutually agreeable before they propose a change.
Engagement is merely the final step after a long series of
small redefinitions of the relationship that advance and con-
firm the marriage potential. By the time engagement occurs,
many discussions about marriage have already taken place in
addition to the numerous indirect attempts to assess the
relationship.
Katie examines her partner Dave's behavior in interacting
with his parents to help her assess the state of his feelings
toward her:
But I remember him telling his mom about me. His mom said he
never talked about his girlfriends to them. I thought that was
pretty significant. Also, I was the first girl he took to meet his
mom and dad, so I knew he was pretty serious about me. (Katie)
Sniezek 7
Interaction with Dave's family is used as evidence of
Dave's feelings about the relationship. Yet, Katie remains
still somewhat unsure whether he is ready to get engaged.
Her uncertainty is similar to Michelle's as she struggles to
read her partner's joking about marriage.
What happened was he started joking a couple months ago. It
was right here in our kitchen. I just was really tired one night and
I made like some slop to eat, maybe it was breakfast I don't
know, but like I put it down on his plate and I'm like "prison
food." And he said "Um gee and we're not even married yet."
And that was like the first joke. It stuck in my mind. (Michelle)
Partners can, in addition to evaluating the partner's behav-
iors and social arrangements, test the partner's feelings for
them. Jose is able to confirm his partner's willingness to
marry him through a discussion he initiated about religion.
One day we started talking about religion and I didn't really plan
this but I said would your beliefs keep you from being serious or
even marrying someone who did not have the same religious
beliefs? It was like this big turning point for me because I knew
however she answered that would determine whether our
relationship had any chance. She hesitated but said no, it
wouldn't. (Jose)
Jose is able to determine the marriage potential without
directly talking about marriage, but more generally using a
hypothetical scenario. Her response would make "evident"
how she felt about potentially marrying him. Wilma also
uses hypothetical discussion through which she is able to
determine that her partner is "open" to the idea of marriage.
He always, from the beginning, talked about how he'd like a
family and would jokingly say he wanted ten kids. I think I just
started getting more specific you know I want two kids, a boy
and a girl, and I want these names and I want to live here and a
husband who respects my career and stuff like that. (Wilma)
Assessment is also accomplished mutually through con-
versation that is full of vague and nonspecific plans.
We talked about long term and the future. We never actually
used the word [marriage]. But there was this implicit
understanding I think. It started the same day we moved in
together and it was like I see us together for the long term. (Tina)
The ongoing conversations, with vague references to their
future together, help to confirm and harden their beliefs
about the current state of and future of their relationship
together.
In the process of assessing the marriage potential, we also
see that coupling takes on an increasing focus on the future.
The participants, in their discourse and actions, begin to shape
a common future together, whether it be "we might someday
marry" or elaborating specifics of their hypothetical family
together. Crafting a joint future is not exclusive to engaged
couples. Sassler and Miller (2011) note that unspoken refer-
ences to a future life together are typical of cohabitating
couples.
Process Two: The Relational Conversation
During the relational assessment process the partner(s) may
secretly evaluate the marriage potential of the relationship
for days, months, or years. The length of time in this process
highly varies. Eventually though, the participant undergoes
the second process whereby they make the new definition of
the relationship an explicit topic of conversation with the
partner. Through dialogue between the partners, the marriage
potential is made "real" as outlined by Berger and Kellner
(1964). Through talk, the marriage future ultimately comes
to be defined, shaped, and negotiated with the partner.
In the first process, any type of redefinition of the rela-
tionship that brings the couple closer to marriage, be it defin-
ing themselves as "possibly marrying," "engaged," or "the
one I want to marry someday" may occur. When a partner
initiates a discussion about this new relationship definition it
typically unfolds through indirect or direct conversation
about the marriage potential of the relationship. Participants
do not typically initiate a redefinition of the relationship via
a formal proposal of marriage. While this is a common por-
trayal of engagement in popular media, in the lives of ordi-
nary people it appears quite rare. There was only one case
that potentially fit this model. In all cases, the initiator has
performed work to determine that marriage is mutually
agreeable before they propose. Engagement is merely the
final step after a long series of small redefinitions of the rela-
tionship that advance and confirm the marriage potential. By
the time engagement occurs, many discussions about mar-
riage have already taken place in addition to the numerous
indirect attempts to assess the relationship.
Women are more likely to initiate the relational conversa-
tion. Women do this through indirect discussion of the poten-
tial for marriage. No woman in the sample offers a formal
marriage proposal to initiate the marital conversation. The
pattern that appears over and over is that the female partner
initiates a discussion of marriage that ultimately leads to her
male partner offering a proposal of marriage.
Initiating a discussion of the marital potential is usually
approached cautiously. Candy raises the issue in the follow-
ing way;
We talked about getting married. (And did he or you bring that
up?). I think I did. Yeah it's like, "so what are you thinking?
Where is this relationship heading?" (Candy)
Candy's question does not ask about marriage specifically,
rather "Where is this relationship heading?" Participants fre-
quently used indirect language including: "Are we moving
8 SAGE Open
forward?" "Is this a permanent thing?" and "Will we settle
down?"
In two cases, the marital conversation is even more subtly
raised through humor. Darrell describes his use of humor:
I wanted to ask her to marry me but, not being from this country,
I didn't know exactly how you do things here. Do I ask her
parents? Should I buy a ring? I wanted to find out but I didn't
know really how to bring it up. I joked about it mostly.
Darrell's jokes do not successfully lead to an open discus-
sion of marriage. Participants may continue additional indi-
rect approaches. Alternatively, they may resort to a more
direct approach. "One day I just finally came out and said
`we've been together for 4 years now. Do you see us moving
forward?'" (Rebecca).
Initiators frequently point to a particular event or signifi-
cant social marker that fuels the change in the relationship.
So, after we decided to move in together I said "I just want to
make sure that you know that moving in is serious to me and that
I see our relationship as a permanent thing." (Jackie)
Social factors are highlighted that make marriage a "natu-
ral" "normal" direction for the relationship. Graduating from
college, moving in together and being together for many
years craft marriage as part of the direction their lives should
be heading in. These accounts may also serve as a way to
address potential rejection of their redefinition of the rela-
tionship and gain leverage in the negotiation process. The
initiation of a redefinition of the relationship, as is revealed
in the next section, is a social construction that can be
adopted, rejected, delayed, altered, or renegotiated.
Process Three: Negotiating
Joint Definitions of the Relationship
What happens after the relational conversation has been
attempted? The participants undergo a process through which
they create a joint definition of the relationship. The process
may be as simple as the partner immediately and directly
accepting the proposed redefinition of the relationship.
Yeah it's like, what are you thinking? And it turns out he was
thinking the same thing. He was like you know I love you a lot.
I want to be with you forever. (Song)
The direct acceptance of the new relationship definition
was not always common. More often there is a negotiated
quality to the interaction that follows. All of the participants
in the study ultimately get married; hence, there are many
redefinitions that are successful. However, this does not mean
that each redefinition attempt was successful. Furthermore,
the road to redefining the relationship may be filled with a
range of contingencies.
In some cases, the redefinition is put on hold or delayed.
Maggie's partner is willing to adopt her redefinition of the
relationship, but at a later point in time.
He said, "Let me think about it." And you know he's very slow
to come to any decision. Even minor decisions so it's very
typical of him. But he decided--he's the one that decided well
we'll get engaged and he picked a certain month. (Maggie)
Maggie agrees to delay the redefinition of the relation-
ship. Indeed, on the month her partner selects, they define
themselves as engaged. The delay of the redefinition is not
characterized as problematic for Maggie. It is constructed as
evidence of her partner's typical style. But, according to
Clark and Labeff (1986), differing definitions of the relation-
ship are a source of strain among intimate couples that fre-
quently spark doubts about continuing the relationship. Thus,
mismatched definitions may be oriented to as a potential
threat to the relationship. In Sandy's case, her partner's resis-
tance to becoming engaged is interpreted as problematic in
the context of what she claims is a preexisting agreement that
if they lived together they will get engaged.
When he asked me to move in with him, I told him I felt
uncomfortable living with someone and not being married--a
moral issue for me. So we talked about it at that time and he
knew that it was a problem for me.
Sandy and Juan report that the subject is a source of ten-
sion and ongoing arguments for a period of several months.
The matter is resolved when Juan finally agrees to become
engaged.
I can't honestly say that I proposed and she agreed. It was rather
that we were having another discussion about marriage and then
we finally found an agreement. (Juan)
A partner can ignore or avoid the marital conversation.
When Elley initiated jokes regarding marriage "Are you the
kind of person to wait until he gets his PhD to get married?"
her partner Matt merely laughs and changes the subject. Matt
reports that he knew she was hinting about engagement but
was not ready to redefine the relationship. In these cases, the
partner is willing to define the relationship as "we will marry
someday" but is not willing to define themselves as engaged
nor take more finalized steps (proposal or public actions)
toward engagement. This type of response may leave the
couple out of synch in their desired definitions of the rela-
tionship and a struggle sometimes ensues.
Avoiding becomes harder as the conversation is more
direct. Elley eventually asks Matt directly when he feels
ready for the "next step." This receives a response from Matt:
I said, "I don't know exactly when I'll feel ready. It has nothing
to do with you. I know I want to marry you. I just don't feel like
I am a person who is old enough to get married."
Sniezek 9
Matt's response is similar to nine other cases in which the
male partner agrees he has the desire to marry the partner, but
is not yet "ready" to get married. A struggle ensues to estab-
lish matching definitions.
When the redefinition is rejected, accepted in part,
avoided, or delayed there are several responses partners give.
The proposed definition can be abandoned or delayed, a new
modified definition can be adopted or attempts can be made
to negotiate, persuade, or pressure the partner to adopt the
definition. In any case, several of these responses may occur.
Attempts to persuade the partner can be a delicate and
tension-filled matter. Chris reminds her partner Dave that
they agreed to get engaged after she graduates from medical
training. Chris becomes frustrated at Dave's response:
He was just sort of making a joke about it--blowing it off. (How
would he do that?). Just laugh and say silly stuff like oh you
know "You're already my ball and chain." I go "I'm serious."
According to Dave, he had already decided to propose but
wanted to wait for their anniversary to surprise her with a
formal proposal. Hence, he is merely pretending to avoid the
new definition. Nonetheless, it is a considerable source of
tension for Chris, who continues to struggle advancing the
engagement.
When a partner continues to resist the new definition of
the relationship, partners may take stronger measures such as
delivering ultimatums or enlisting the help of third parties.
Jackie makes reference to a third party to get leverage in bar-
gaining for the redefinition of the relationship.
So, after we decided to move in together, I just said, "My mom's
not too happy that we're moving in together because she thinks
I'm going to get hurt again. But I told her that I know you're
committed to me. But I just want to make sure that you know
that moving in is serious to me and that I see our relationship as
a permanent thing." (Jackie)
In the struggle to redefine the relationship there are prac-
tices that, in some way, give the participant a measure of con-
trol over how the relationship proceeds. After mutual
agreement is made to someday marry, the next step is for the
partner (in every case the male partner) to propose marriage.
Being in the position to give the formal proposal allows this
partner a measure of control. For example, Jackie anticipates
a proposal as they have previously agreed they will someday
marry. However, she does not know when it will occur. Jackie
attempts to influence the timing of the proposal through hints.
I was hoping you know maybe I would get it [proposal] during
the holidays. But I'm sure--I can't remember exactly but I'm
sure I hinted. We would go by a jewelry store and I would say,
hey should we look inside?
Women's attempt to expedite a proposal was noted in
research on cohabitating couples (Sassler & Miller, 2011). In
addition to gaining a measure of control through initiating
the formal proposal, the partner who keeps a level of secrecy
regarding when and how he will propose also receives some
control of the process. Dave, for example, by secretly adopt-
ing the redefinition and planning a surprise proposal trans-
forms himself into the initiator of the process and retains
control of its timing.
Process Four: Formalizing the New Definition of
the Relationship
Engagement is not fully real until formalized practices are
invoked. Many participants, for example, do not define
themselves as engaged without a formal proposal. Formal
practices however are not fixed. Formal practices range from
the purchase of rings, setting a wedding date, formal
announcements to family and friends to holding engagement
celebrations. These practices make the redefinition of the
relationship increasingly public and hardened. While formal-
ity and tradition are evident in the engagement process, they,
by no means, dictate the interaction. The participants, to
some degree, pick and choose formal practices, negotiate
between themselves how and when they invoke the rituals,
or leave various rituals out all together. The participants
themselves frequently recognized the contingent and fluid
nature of the rituals as they struggle to define for themselves
and others the meanings of the formalized practices.
A formal proposal is the defining moment of engagement
for many couples. However, in several cases, the couple
defines themselves as engaged through ongoing mundane
conversation. Recall, Sandy and Juan are engaged after their
ongoing discussion resulted in an agreement. Nonetheless,
Sandy and Juan enact practices that formalize the engage-
ment. In fact these practices, while not the defining moment
of engagement, are still important in making the engagement
fully real. Sandy describes the importance of buying her ring.
I was more excited about the ring than I thought I would be. I
was walking out of the store with this shiny ring ongoing "Wow
this is it. I'm getting married."
What is defined as the necessary formal practices may
vary between couples or the partners themselves. Eli and
Min define themselves as engaged when they will tell their
family and friends about their intentions to marry. Hence, the
formal proposal and ring are not immediately important.
Eventually outsiders interpret the couple's relationship
based on rituals and symbols. Mark and Kay, for example,
work quickly to have a formal proposal with a ring before
their engagement party. "There's no way you can go to the
engagement party without a proposal and a ring. Like that
would be crazy" (Mark). The proposal and ring are acquired
in anticipation of the reaction they expect from others. Others
might question the seriousness of their new relationship sta-
tus without the accompanying ritual work.
10 SAGE Open
Rings and other symbols are also interpreted by the cou-
ple as a sign of the partner's serious investment in the new
definition of the relationship. This becomes apparent when
the absence of these rituals or symbols are noted and used to
interpret the relationship.
So, when we were finally able to pick up the ring and I go "Hey
we can pick up the ring today" fully expecting her to be excited.
She says "Oh we can just get it tomorrow." I was like "Whoa,
what's going on here. Are you having doubts?" (Yoshi)
The performance of the rituals is a resource for interpret-
ing the commitment of the partner. A male partner's surprise
proposal would be considered unsatisfactory, or less "real" if
the performance showed no creativity or sensitivity to the
importance of the occasion (Schweingruber, Anahita, &
Berns, 2004).
There is a significant degree of variation regarding the
presence or absence of formalized practices, so much so that
it creates the possibility that partners have differing defini-
tions of when engagement occurs and/or differing notions of
appropriate formal practices. Martin believes engagement
occurs more formally while Gloria believes it happens in
mundane conversation.
One day I was hugging her and I said something like I can see us
getting married some day. Well, the next day she said "I told my
parents we were engaged." I was taken aback. I mean I guess
I'm lucky because like most guys I didn't have to sweat it out
doing the whole ring and asking permission and all that. (Did
you intend to get engaged when you said that when you were
hugging her?) Well, no not--I didn't mean that to be--you
know like most people think of getting engaged. But, I was
happy none the less. I mean I loved her a lot and I was like well
it just happened a little sooner and saved me all the stress
anyway.
While Martin's intention is not to become engaged, he
readily accepts and adopts Gloria's definition of the situation.
The engagement rituals can be negotiated in ongoing inter-
action. After Darrell reveals his intention to propose at the
couple's favorite restaurant, his partner, Annette suggests he
propose by the beautiful bridge at the restaurant. Darrell says
he prefers to wait until they have Champagne after dinner.
When Annette says she is too excited to wait, Darrel agrees to
propose at both the bridge and later, with Champagne. When
they are at the bridge he asks "Do I get down on one knee? To
which Annette response "No, we're equals here." Together,
on a moment to moment basis, they choose and negotiate the
rituals that transform their relationship.
Formality and tradition clearly play an important part of
the engagement process. Formal practices can construct,
harden, and amplify the new definition of the relationship.
Yet, rather than dictating behavior, the formal practices are an
interactional resource the couple and others can reflexively
use in making sense of and constructing the relationship.
Process Five: Publicizing the New Definition
Revealing the marriage decision to others is a necessary and
important part of the engagement process. Notifying other peo-
ple can be done through formal practices such as engagement
parties, rings, and public formal proposals. Conversely, couples
may inform family and friends informally, through conversa-
tion. In the fifth process, the couple makes the engagement
public, especially informally to family and friends.
The act of telling others about the engagement helps to
confirm and harden the reality of the decision. Engagement
may not feel fully real without telling others. Rhonda's
engagement experience, for example, is hindered when she
cannot reach her family and friends.
Here I have this earth shattering news and no one's at home. I
mean it's hard for it to be a big deal when you don't have anyone
to share it with. I became so desperate to get just anyone I was
calling down the list.
Rhonda's experience of sharing the engagement with oth-
ers prevents her from experiencing the engagement in a dra-
matic way--"to be a big deal."
All of the participants in the sample make their engage-
ment public, most of which are immediate (usually during
the moment to a week later). A notable exception is the male
participants who ask their partner's father's (or parents') per-
mission to marry their daughter before the formal proposal.
According to Schweingruber et al. (2004), asking parental
consent not only serves to involve family but is a way to
confirm the partner's serious commitment to marriage.
Timing of public announcements is important. Matt waits
6 months before he announces the news of his engagement to
his friends and coworkers. His partner Salima clearly orients
to this as a signal of his potential lack of commitment to the
redefinition of the relationship.
Matt:

So it took me a while to get around to it (announc-
ing the engagement) because I was doing this in-
person thing.
Salima:
You didn't tell anybody in your department here
either because you said you were into your project
and didn't want to distract attention.
Matt: 
But you know . . .
Salima:
We didn't quite understand why (sarcastic tone).
Matt: 
So, anyway, I was uh--I didn't do that very well. I
dropped some balls (laughs).
Public involvement in the engagement triggers changes
in the couple's and their family's social relationships.
Couples who have not previously met their fiancé's family
(especially parents) often do so on engagement. More time
and activities are frequently spent with the partner's fami-
lies. Engagement parties or family dinners, for example,
may be arranged to bring the participants and others
Sniezek 11
together. Even when family interaction does not increase
because the families were previously highly involved, the
family dynamics begin to change. The families begin to
focus their discussions and activities toward planning the
wedding.
Meetings, conversations, and planning between families
cement the new definition of the relationship. The greater the
involvement of others, the more the relationship is estab-
lished. The relationship becomes so entrenched, that it may
be difficult for brides and grooms, who no longer wish to
marry the partner, to back out of the engagement. As partners
and families invest financially and large amounts of time in
planning the wedding, others now have a stake in the new
definition.
Families do not always cooperate in creating the new def-
inition of the relationship, although the expectation to do so
is ever present. When families do not appear to support the
new definition, couples react with disappointment and anxi-
ety. In the extreme case, the family can try to prevent the
redefinition from happening and try to break up the couple.
While none of the participants in the sample report any such
direct behavior, they did report instances in which the family
indicated they were unhappy with the partner or were not
fully accepting of the new definition of the relationship.
Carmen's brother relays to her that her fiancé is "not the right
person" for her and refuses to go to the wedding. The efforts
by the family to alter the direction of the relationship can be
ignored, negotiated, or adopted. In Carmen's case, her
brother is ignored.
Participants most frequently noted family's influence in
directing the nature of the engagement. In two cases, the
partners report feeling immediate pressure to adopt the fam-
ily's religious beliefs.
After we told them we were engaged, that was the first question
his mother asked. Are you going to have a Jewish wedding? I'm
like we're having it at the temple. That was the point where she
was the happiest. Then, the next question was "Are you
converting?" (Laura)
Family pressures may result in a direct behavior change.
However, couples are not passive recipients of the family
pressures. In the two cases in which the partners felt immedi-
ate pressure to convert to the family's religion, neither con-
verted. Nonetheless these experiences may alter the
relationship with the family. In Carmen's case, her brother's
insistence she was marrying the wrong man ultimately, in her
words "drove us [Carmen and her brother] apart." Family
responses, whether positive or negative, serve to reinforce
the gravity and importance of the new definition of the
relationship.
Couples can anticipate family responses and engage in
what Goffman (1959) refers to as preventive practices
wherein couples construct an interactional situation that
favors a positive reaction and minimizes a negative one.
Candy and Dan delay the engagement announcement to min-
imize a potential negative response.
Dan:
We wanted to wait until we had a ring and I wanted
to make sure I had this job, otherwise . . .
Candy:
I mean my parents would want to know he had a
stable job.
Some of the influence others have on the engagement pro-
cess is more subtle and built up over time. For instance, cou-
ples find that when they tell others about their engagement,
they are often asked about the "story" of the engagement and
the details of their wedding planning. In fact, this is often
how proper engagement behavior is communicated to the
couple. Jennifer is so frequently asked by others the date of
her wedding, she feels she must come up with one.
Sort of like at first we enjoyed the engagement, but then it sort
of happened by itself because everybody kind of asks you "So
when are you getting married?" So you sort of realize we've got
to pick a date.
Furthermore, telling and retelling the story of engagement
and discussing the details of the wedding hardens and makes
real the definition of the relationship.
Discussion and Conclusion
The media portrayal of becoming engaged is typically of a
man on bended knee formally proposing marriage to a
woman. It is shown as one isolated moment. Many of the
couples in this study experience similar rituals, but these
moments make up only a very small part of their engage-
ment. If researchers focus on the ritual and formal acts, the
rich and diverse ways participants meaningfully understand
and invoke marriage in their relationship are ignored.
Likewise, using stage models in which behaviors are analyti-
cally grouped into predictable, fixed stages ignores the con-
text in which engagement unfolds in ongoing interaction and
the interactional work required to define and construct the
reality of the relationship. The process model offered in this
study allows sociologists to see the numerous processes that
take place long before and after the public rituals are enacted.
The formal marriage proposal is merely one step in a long
series of small redefinitions of the relationship that advance
and confirm the marriage potential. By the time formal
engagement occurs, many discussions and/or actions moving
the relationship forward have already taken place.
The process model is not designed to mimic a stage model
whereby couples follow predictable behaviors over time. In
the process model, couples can be in more than one stage,
couples widely vary in how long they remain in a stage--
from seconds, days, to years and may avoid a linear progres-
sion going back and forth in and out of processes. These
issues present a problem for the stage model as it is difficult
12 SAGE Open
to categorize the participants' varied behaviors. However, in
the process model, behaviors that are unclear are the very
sorts of behaviors this model examines. How the participants
make sense of and interpret behaviors from their partners,
that are usually indirect, unclear, and even contradictory,
have to be sorted out by the participants themselves. The
model sheds light on this very process--the messy work of
reality construction.
The engagement process occurs through talk and actions
that construct a new definition of the relationship. There is
no formula that describes specific behaviors couples enact.
Instead, the road is paved by a myriad of actions and reac-
tions by the couple and others that are continuously negoti-
ated. This study finds that the processes, nonetheless, are
characterized by some common features.
First, definitions of the relationship are tenuous and must
be actively created. New definitions of the relationship do
not "just happen." Initiators take steps to bring them about.
Attempts to alter relationships are usually performed cau-
tiously and, initially, subtly through indirect processes.
Because much is at stake, care is taken to ensure the new
definition of the relationship is one that will be well received
by the partner and others.
There is a negotiated quality to the interaction in each of
the processes. At any point in time, the new definition can be
abandoned, delayed, modified, or adopted. Even in the very
earliest stages, when a partner is assessing whether the rela-
tionship or the partner is marriage worthy, these assessments
can be influenced by others or tested and changed in interac-
tion. Moreover, the partner or family can negotiate and influ-
ence the redefinition of the relationship at various points
throughout the process.
There are a variety of interactional tools couples can draw
on to construct the new definition of the relationship. Hinting,
testing, rearranging social circles, and formal rituals are only
a few examples participants use to construct and harden the
new definition of the relationship. The practices, rather than
dictating behavior, are resources the couple and others can
reflexively use in making sense of and constructing the
relationship.
The work of becoming engaged takes cooperation with
others. Goffman's (1959) notion of teamwork is useful here.
Not only do the couples have to work to be synch with each
other, they must work with family and friends to make it
fully real. Recall that engagement was subject to change
when it was announced to family.
Finally, socioeconomic variables such as race, class,
religion, occupation, age, and gender can play a role in the
coupling process. Couples, for example, follow some ste-
reotypical gender norms in the engagement process. Women
were far more likely to initiate the marital conversation
while men were much likely to offer the formal marriage
proposal. Religion was noted by several participants as
being potentially problematic in the coupling process both
in assessing if engagement was possible and in family
support of the engagement. Other socioeconomic variables,
such as race, class, and age were not directly analyzed in
this study because they were not made the topic of rele-
vance by the participants in interviews. However, this is a
promising area of future research that a larger pool of par-
ticipants and focused interviewing on these topics would
likely reveal their sociological relevance.
Limitations of the Research
The research relies on a fairly homogeneous sample of first-
time married, heterosexual, childless, and somewhat edu-
cated sample from California. Thus, caution should be
exercised in generalizing the results. Likewise, because all of
the participants were "successful" in getting married, in
other words, did not have a permanent relationship breakup
prior to marriage, the findings are relevant only to those cou-
ples who achieve marriage. Future research would include
unsuccessfully engaged couples to identify what parts of the
process break down and how. This would ultimately clarify
the relationship model.
Directions for Future Research
The process model provides sociologists with a long over-
due understanding about how intimate heterosexual rela-
tionships are transformed into being formally engaged to
be married. Steps needed to refine the model include:
drawing on more diverse samples, focusing interview
questions around specific socioeconomic variables, and
providing a comparative analysis of unsuccessful engage-
ments. The model's usefulness will likely extend to rela-
tionships beyond engagement and/or heterosexual couples.
Perhaps the cohabiting couple with no intentions to marry
or the committed homosexual couple draws on similar
reality-producing practices as they become serious. Future
research can confirm these questions. The model can also
potentially be useful in examining relationships that are
not romantic. Friendships or business relationships may
also use a similar reality-producing process. These and
other types of intimate relationships are promising areas of
future research.
Despite the limited sample, the model is an important first
step in developing a picture of relationships that goes beyond
stages and incorporates participant's analysis and under-
standing of their social worlds in making decisions about and
operating in their relationship. The alternative process model
avoids the static model and fixed behaviors for each stage of
the relationship. In the new model, behaviors vary based on
the context of their social world. Participants actively assess
and make decisions about their complex and frequently
unclear relationship using interactional tools. That is why the
process will not look the same for any couple. Ultimately, the
model appreciates the creativity, hard work, and complexity
of the lived experience.
