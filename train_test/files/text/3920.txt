Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effects of long-term treatment with bosentan on pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH) in patients with systemic sclerosis.
Methods: Patients with systemic sclerosis were followed between 2003 and 2014; those who
developed digital ulcers were treated with standard regimens of bosentan. Patients were assessed
at baseline and every 12 months using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, 6-min walking
distance test, Borg dyspnoea index and monitoring of plasma levels of 76-amino-acid N-terminal
probrain natriuretic peptide. Patients who developed PAH underwent right heart catheterization
to confirm the diagnosis.
Results: Sixty-nine patients with systemic sclerosis were enrolled in the study. Of these, 25
developed digital ulcers and received treatment with bosentan; the remaining 44 comprised the
control group. None of the patients treated with bosentan developed PAH during the follow-up
period. Furthermore, in these patients the mean Æ SD systolic pulmonary arterial pressure
significantly decreased from 33.64 Æ 2.91 mmHg at baseline to 26.20 Æ 1.78 mmHg at the end of
the follow-up period. In contrast, in the control group, seven patients developed PAH during the
follow-up period, with the mean Æ SD systolic pulmonary arterial pressure significantly increasing
from 33.57 Æ 2.75 mmHg at baseline to 39.41 Æ 4.11 mmHg at the end of the follow-up period.
Conclusion: Long-term treatment with bosentan reduces the risk of developing PAH in patients
with systemic sclerosis.

Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a
well known late complication of systemic
sclerosis.1 PAH is defined as a systolic
pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP)
> 45 mmHg and is confirmed by right heart
catheterization (mean pulmonary arterial
pressure > 25 mmHg with a capillary
wedge pressure 15 mmHg). Endothelial
impairment and vascular dysfunction may
be the earliest pathogenetic changes that
occur in systemic sclerosis.2 Endothelin (ET)
1 is a potent mitogenic factor produced
mainly by endothelial cells that interacts
with two cell membrane-bound receptors
ETA and ETB.3 Bosentan is an oral com-
petitive specific dual ETA and ETB receptor
antagonist4 that is used in the treatment of
digital ulcers5 and which is also approved
for the treatment of functional class II and
III PAH (World Health Organization
classification).6
Patients and methods
Between January and December 2003,
patients aged !18 years with systemic sclero-
sis (with a negative pregnancy test if female),
treated at the Clinical Immunology Unit,
University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy, were
enrolled in the study and followed up until
December 2014. Patients who developed
digital ulcers were treated with bosentan
62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, then 125 mg
twice a day. The control group comprised
the remaining patients who did not develop
digital ulcers. Transthoracic Doppler echo-
cardiography, 6-min walking distance test,7
Borg dyspnoea index8 and plasma levels of
76-amino-acid N-terminal probrain natri-
uretic peptide (NT-proBNP; a potential
marker of heart failure), were performed at
baseline and every 12 months during the
study period. Patients who developed PAH
underwent right heart catheterization.
The primary endpoint was development
of PAH. Secondary endpoints were a change
in the 6-min walking distance test, Borg
dyspnoea index or plasma levels of NT-
proBNP over the follow-up period.
Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients. The study was approved
by the Regional Ethical Committee and
conducted in accordance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
Good Clinical Practice guidelines, as well
as national and international regulatory
requirements.
Statistical analyses
Data were reported as n (%) of patients or
mean Æ SD. Differences between the two
groups were analysed using 2-test or
Fisher's exact test. A P-value 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Sixty-nine patients with systemic sclerosis
were enrolled in the study, of whom 25
developed digital ulcers and were treated
with bosentan. Baseline characteristics of
the enrolled patients are given in Table 1.
The mean duration of treatment with
bosentan was 6.75 Æ 0.25 years. At baseline,
no patients presented with clinical or echo-
cardiographic indirect signs of PAH in
either group (sPAP <45 mmHg). There
was no statistical difference in mean sPAP
between the two groups at baseline.
None of the patients treated with bosen-
tan developed PAH during the 12-year
86 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1S)
follow-up period. Furthermore, the mean Æ
SD sPAP significantly decreased from
33.64 Æ 2.91 mmHg at baseline to 26.20 Æ
1.78 mmHg at the end of the follow-up
period (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1). In contrast,
in the control group, seven patients developed
PAH, confirmed by right heart catheteriza-
tion, during follow-up, with the meanÆ SD
sPAP increasing significantly from 33.57Æ
2.75mmHg at baseline to 39.41 Æ 4.11mmHg
at the end of the follow-up period (P< 0.0001)
(Figure 1).
During the follow-up period, patients
receiving bosentan showed a significant
overall improvement in the 6-min walking
distance test and the Borg dyspnoea index
values (P < 0.0001), whereas in the control
group, both the 6-min walking distance
test and the Borg dyspnoea index values
worsened (P < 0.0001 for both) (data not
shown). NT-proBNP levels significantly
decreased in patients receiving bosentan
and significantly increased in controls (P ¼
0.004 and P ¼ 0.008, respectively) (data not
shown).
Discussion
In the present study, no patients treated
with bosentan developed PAH during the
follow-up period, which supports the clinical
efficacy of long-term bosentan treatment
in reducing the risk of developing PAH in
patients with systemic sclerosis. These find-
ings are in agreement with those reported in
a long-term observational study showing
the low occurrence of digital ulcers in
patients with systemic sclerosis receiving
bosentan for PAH.9 Increased ET-1 activity
inhibits nitric oxide synthesis, which has
been found to be impaired in patients with
systemic sclerosis.10 Bosentan improves
exercise-induced and flow-mediated pul-
monary vasodilatation and thus restores
endothelial function by increasing nitric
oxide production.10
In conclusion, long-term treatment
with bosentan improves endothelial
function and reduces the risk of PAH
development in patients with systemic
sclerosis. Early initiation of bosentan
