Estimating the Counterfactual: How Many
Uninsured Adults Would There Be Today
Without the ACA?
Linda J. Blumberg, PhD1, Bowen Garrett, PhD1, and John Holahan, PhD1
Abstract
Time lags in receiving data from long-standing, large federal surveys complicate real-time estimation of the coverage effects
of full Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation. Fast-turnaround household surveys fill some of the void in data on recent
changes to insurance coverage, but they lack the historical data that allow analysts to account for trends that predate the
ACA, economic fluctuations, and earlier public program expansions when predicting how many people would be uninsured
without comprehensive health care reform. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 2000 to 2012 and
the Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) data for 2013 and 2015, this article develops an approach to estimate the
number of people who would be uninsured in the absence of the ACA and isolates the change in coverage as of March 2015
that can be attributed to the ACA. We produce counterfactual forecasts of the number of uninsured absent the ACA for 9
age-income groups and compare these estimates with 2015 estimates based on HRMS relative coverage changes applied to
CPS-based population estimates. As of March 2015, we find the ACA has reduced the number of uninsured adults by 18.1
million compared with the number who would have been uninsured at that time had the law not been implemented. That
decline represents a 46% reduction in the number of nonelderly adults without insurance. The approach developed here can
be applied to other federal data and timely surveys to provide a range of estimates of the overall effects of reform.

Original Research
Given the large public investment in expanding health insur-
ance coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and the
degree of controversy the law has engendered, it is important
to accurately quantify the causal effects of the ACA on cov-
erage, accounting for likely changes that would have resulted
absent the policy change (eg, due to the recovery from the
Great Recession). In this article, we develop an approach to
(1) estimate the number of people who would be uninsured
in the absence of the ACA and (2) isolate the change in cov-
erage as of March 2015 that can be attributed to policy
changes under the ACA. The ACA's main coverage reforms
included an expansion of Medicaid, income-related tax cred-
its and cost-sharing reductions for nongroup insurance, an
array of small group and nongroup private insurance regula-
tory reforms, and an individual mandate, the vast majority of
which were implemented in January of 2014. Provisions that
allowed young adults (aged 19-25) to remain on their par-
ents' health insurance policies were implemented in 2010.
Many modest policy changes to private insurance regulation,
not believed to have had significant effects on the number of
insured nonelderly adults, also took effect for plan years
starting on or after September 23, 2010. These included
elimination of lifetime dollar benefit caps, the gradual
increase of allowable annual dollar benefit limits, first-dollar
coverage for certain preventive benefits, and others.1
Although the original intent of the law was that eligibility
for Medicaid would be expanded in every state, a Supreme
Court decision made expanding optional and only 28 states
had done so as of the end of summer 2014, significantly
reducing the potential coverage effect of the law.2 Three
additional states have expanded Medicaid since then. In
addition, 3 states (California, Connecticut, and Minnesota)
and the District of Columbia opted to expand Medicaid
before 2014 under the auspices of the ACA. Nonetheless,
major increases in insurance coverage caused by the ACA
should materialize most profoundly in 2014 and 2015.
Indeed, a number of surveys have found increases in cov-
erage for adults since 2015.3-5 These data are important, but

it is not enough to simply compare 2013 with 2014 or 2015
to assess the impact of the ACA, because that comparison
implicitly assumes that there would have been no change in
coverage between 2013 and 2014 or 2015 if the ACA had not
been implemented. Rather, if we want to understand the
effect of the ACA on coverage, we must assess what would
have happened had there been no ACA and compare the new
levels of coverage with that counterfactual. We develop our
estimate of what would have happened in the absence of the
ACA by modeling coverage from 2000 to 2012 and account-
ing for preexisting trends and determinants of insurance cov-
erage. A similarly intentioned approach was taken by
Sommers and colleagues, but they relied on a time trend
from 2012 and 2013 data alone. Our approach relies on a pre-
ACA time trend and uses a substantially longer period.6
There has been a long-term decline in employer-
sponsored insurance, mostly among low-wage workers.7
Medicaid enrollment has expanded over the past few decades,
particularly because of increased eligibility for children. The
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has also
expanded coverage. The net result has been reductions in the
number of uninsured children, but increases in the number of
uninsured adults. The Great Recession exacerbated these
trends, resulting in a large drop in employer-sponsored insur-
ance and an increase in the number of uninsured. We are now
in an economic recovery, with unemployment dropping.
Generally, declines in unemployment lead to increases in
employer-sponsored insurance.8
Given the recovery and absent other changes, Medicaid
rolls would have fallen as more families'incomes increased,
although the magnitude of such changes would depend on
changes in the distribution of income. The number of unin-
sured could thus have decreased for most groups but
increased for some because of the steady erosion of
employer-sponsored insurance that has taken place, particu-
larly caused by declines in small firms' coverage offers,
which have continued quite steadily since at least 1999.9 In
this article, we estimate the effect of changes in economic
conditions, secular trends, and public insurance eligibility
on uninsurance rates, by age and income group, and we use
these estimates to predict what would have happened if
there had been no ACA. We then compare these predictions
with 2015 data on uninsurance to estimate the effects of the
law's implementation.
This type of analysis requires both a model of how unin-
surance rates would change absent the ACA that captures
long-standing trends and a source of data that provides timely
measures of uninsurance rates and comparable rates before
the implementation of the ACA's major coverage provisions
in 2014. Both the Current Population Survey (CPS) and
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) have data histories
that enable modeling of the long-term trends, cyclical effects,
and demographic shifts affecting health insurance coverage
to produce a counterfactual estimate of the uninsurance rate,
but those surveys become available with a time lag. In this
article, we use the CPS because, unlike the NHIS, it provides
state identifiers on its public use files. Newer, Internet-based
household surveys, such as the Urban Institute's Health
Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) and another conducted
by Gallup, provide fast-turnaround results using quarterly
data from both before and after 2014, but those surveys do
not have the long data histories needed to estimate long-term
trends. The approach described below uses a combination of
a CPS-time trend and recent data from the HRMS as an
example of how the advantages of both types of data--large,
long-standing federal surveys and fast-turnaround Internet-
based surveys--can be brought to bear to inform us of the
ACA's effects on an ongoing basis.
Methodological Approach
Forecasting the Number of Uninsured If There
Were No ACA
Our analysis estimates changes in the number of uninsured
nonelderly adults from 2013 to 2015 that would have
occurred in the absence of the ACA. We examine nonelderly
adults because it is for this population that we have data on
coverage changes over this period from sources of timely
private quarterly data such as the HRMS and Gallup. We
design the analysis to account for the effects of long-standing
trends in uninsurance rates, cyclical effects caused by eco-
nomic conditions, and changes in Medicaid eligibility. As the
primary data source, we use survey years 2001 to 2013 of the
Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the CPS, which
measures individual-level insurance status and income data
from 2000 to 2012. Although there is some controversy as to
whether the survey participants' responses to the CPS cover-
age questions align with the reference period, we interpret
the data collected to be consistent with the type of coverage
the respondent typically had during the course of the preced-
ing year. We choose the 2000 to 2012 time frame for estimat-
ing a series of regression models because it is long enough to
reflect long-term trends and roughly balances years of good
and bad economic conditions; it also demonstrates cyclical-
ity in coverage rates consistent with changing economic con-
ditions. The period includes 2 economic cycles, including the
dot-com bust and recovery, the Great Recession, and some
years of incomplete recovery. We do not use data from the
2014 survey because of changes in the measurement of unin-
surance that would introduce a discontinuity in the time
series.
We conduct analyses separately for 9 population seg-
ments defined by 3 income categories relative to the federal
poverty level (FPL; 0%-138% of FPL [low income], 139%-
400% of FPL [middle income], and >400% of FPL [high
income]) and 3 age categories (ages 19-25, 26-44, and
45-64). Levels and historic trends in uninsurance rates differ
substantially by income and (to a lesser extent) age, separate
from any effects of the ACA. We also expect different
Blumberg et al. 3
coverage effects for the 3 income groups because Medicaid
expansions are targeted to the low-income group, and finan-
cial assistance (premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc-
tions) to purchase individual coverage through the
marketplaces are targeted to those in the middle-income
group. Those in the higher income group receive no financial
assistance to purchase marketplace coverage under the ACA
but are the most likely to face a penalty if they do not obtain
coverage under the ACA's individual mandate. Within each
income group, the coverage effects of the ACA may differ by
age group for several reasons, including access to coverage
through a parent's employer for young adults, increasing
demand for health insurance with age, and age differences in
access to coverage through an employer.
For each of the income-age groups, we estimate linear
regression models of the uninsurance rate at the state-year
level. The CPS data are collapsed to the state-year level, by
income-age group, with sample weights applied. We then
augment CPS data by merging in unemployment rates at the
state-year level specific to each of the 3 age groups in the
analysis (which we compute from CPS basic monthly files
for years 2000-2015) and Urban Institute estimates of
Medicaid eligibility rates (detailed below) by state, year, and
income-age group.
Each regression model specifies the expected uninsurance
rate in a state and year to be a function of a linear year trend
(common to all states), state fixed effects, the unemployment
rate, and the percentage of adults who qualify for Medicaid
through provisions covering parents (which for brevity, we
refer to as the "Medicaid eligibility rate"). For the higher
income group, the Medicaid eligibility rate is excluded
because no adults with incomes above 400% of FPL are esti-
mated to be Medicaid eligible.
When the models are fit to the data, the year trend cap-
tures the secular trend in the uninsurance rate over the sam-
ple period that is not correlated with the other included
factors (which may arise from trends in health care costs,
premiums, cost sharing, or other factors). The state fixed
effects control for factors related to differences in uninsur-
ance rates across states that are constant over time (such as
premium-level differences, employment patterns, fixed attri-
butes of Medicaid programs, and uncontrolled demographic
differences). Also, by including the state fixed effects, the
coefficients on the unemployment and Medicaid eligibility
variables are estimated only using within-state variation. The
unemployment rate captures the extent to which the uninsur-
ance rate rises and falls over economic cycles,8 and the
Medicaid eligibility rate controls for Medicaid expansions
over the period. By including the Medicaid eligibility rate
variable, we prevent the year trend variable from picking up
the effects of Medicaid expansions in eligibility for parents
(and expansions for nonparents to the extent they are corre-
lated with the parent expansions).
Medicaid eligibility rates were computed as the (weighted)
percentage of adults in each age group, income group, state,
and year who were eligible for Medicaid through the provi-
sions for parents. Individuals in the CPS were deemed eligi-
ble if they were a parent and if the income of their health
insurance unit was below the Medicaid/CHIP eligibility
threshold that applied to parents in their state and year.
Medicaid/CHIP eligibility thresholds for parents by state and
year were collected from Kaiser Family Foundation reports.10
Because of the complexity of the Medicaid provisions for
adult nonparents that exist in some states (such as work
requirements and enrollment caps), it was not possible to
capture eligibility for nonparents in this measure. To better
understand the effect of this limitation on our results, we esti-
mated versions of the regression models below that excluded
data from 5 states that had already made ACA-like Medicaid
expansions to childless adults before the ACA. The states
were Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont as
well as the District of Columbia. Each of these states already
provided Medicaid or Medicaid-like coverage to nonparents
with incomes up to at least 100% of the FPL before the ACA.
Other states had also made more limited Medicaid expan-
sions to childless adults. The year trend effects were more
strongly positive when these states were excluded, suggest-
ing that there would have been larger growth in the adult
uninsurance rate from 2000 to 2012 nationally if these states
had not expanded Medicaid to nonparents. The implication
for our main analysis is that the forecasted increases in adult
uninsurance rates absent the ACA would likely be larger (as
would effects of the ACA in reducing coverage) if we con-
trolled for Medicaid eligibility for nonparents. In this sense,
our estimates of the ACA's effects are conservative.
We take a series of additional steps in the analysis so that
early effects of the ACA are not inadvertently built into the
counterfactual estimates of uninsurance rates. First, we remove
the effects of the early ACA Medicaid expansions in 4 states
from our predicted uninsurance rates in each group by
excluding the state-years with early expansions from the
estimation sample of the regressions.11 If these state-years
were included, the year trends in the model could pick up
coverage effects that are due to the ACA. Specifically, we
exclude data from Connecticut and the District of Columbia
from 2010 to 2012 and data from California and Minnesota
from 2011 to 2012 from the estimation sample of the unin-
surance rate regression models. Two other states, New Jersey
and Washington, also made early Medicaid expansions under
the ACA but these were transfers of enrollees from preexist-
ing state programs to Medicaid. Because they did not involve
new enrollment, we did not exclude them from the estima-
tion sample. Although these early expansions may not have
been fully phased in until 2014 (eg, participation and income
eligibility varied by county in California, and income eligi-
bility was not up to the full 2014 levels in Connecticut and
Minnesota), we exclude the entire state-year with early
expansion from the estimation sample so the models do not
pick up effects that could be attributable to the ACA. Some
other states had already expanded coverage to childless
4 INQUIRY
adults using waiver authority that predated the ACA. We
consider trends in uninsurance rates related to these pre-ACA
expansions as part of the counterfactual, and accordingly we
do not exclude states with pre-ACA expansions for childless
adults from our estimation sample. As a second related step,
when computing predicted uninsurance rates using the esti-
mated regression models, we hold the Medicaid eligibility
variable fixed at its value in the year just before the early
expansion for all subsequent years; that hold prevents
changes in the Medicaid eligibility variable attributable to
the ACA from affecting the predicted uninsurance rates.
Finally, we restrict the data used to estimate the regression
models for young adults to data years 2000 to 2009. The
ACA expanded coverage for young adults starting in late
2010, leading to noticeably lower uninsurance rates for this
group in 2011 and 2012 according to the CPS and other data
sources. If we did not exclude 2010 through 2012 from the
young adult models, the effects of the ACA's dependent cov-
erage expansions that were implemented in the second half
of 2010 would instead be attributed to the pre-ACA trend.12
Even though we expect very little effect of dependent cover-
age expansion in 2010 given that it started late in the year, we
exclude 2010 to avoid picking up any ACA effect in the
counterfactual models for young adults. For the remaining
age groups, we estimate the regression models using all years
from 2000 to 2012.
Table 1 reports estimated coefficients for each regression
model. For the low-income group, higher unemployment is
significantly associated with higher rates of uninsurance and
is the largest driver of coverage changes for all 3 age groups.
The year trend is statistically insignificant for all three age
groups. For young adults, higher rates of Medicaid eligibility
are significantly associated with lower rates of uninsurance.
For the middle-income group, the year trend is the largest
driver of changes in uninsurance. In each of the age groups,
the uninsurance rate is increasing about 0.4 percentage points
each year on average, controlling for the other factors. Higher
unemployment is associated with higher uninsurance rates
for the oldest group. The effect of the unemployment rate is
statistically insignificant for the other 2 age groups. For
adults in the high-income group, we find statistically signifi-
cant year trends for the middle and older age groups, with the
uninsurance rate increasing by 0.10 and 0.13 percentage
points on average each year, respectively, controlling for
other factors. Unemployment rate effects are small and only
statistically significant (at the 10% level) for the middle age
group.
In Figures 1 to 3, we examine overall model performance
at the national level by age group and income group. We
compute predicted values from the regression models for
each year and collapse the data to the national level by year
to examine overall performance. For the 2 older groups
across each income group, the model predictions fit the
actual data very well, clearly capturing both the overall trend
and cyclical effects related to changes in the unemployment
rate during the Great Recession for the low-income group.

For young adults, the predicted values appear to fit the
actual trend less well, but the model is performing as intended
for 2 reasons. First, actual uninsurance rates are substantially
below predicted uninsured rates for 2011 and 2012 (and to a
lesser degree 2010) for each income group. The decline of
the uninsurance rate from 2010 may be attributed to the
ACA's dependent coverage provision. The predicted trend is
intended not to capture the ACA's effects, and it is shown to
continue the preexisting trend. Second, uninsurance rates for
young adults exhibit more year-to-year volatility than the 2
other age groups because they are based on smaller samples.
Thus, the models effectively capture the overall trend in
uninsurance for young adults before implementation of the
ACA's dependent coverage expansions that were targeted at
young adults.
Using the estimated regression models, we generate out-
of-sample forecasts of uninsurance rates by income-age
group to 2015. Out-of-sample regression predictions are
computed using actual state unemployment data in each year
(by age group) as was used in the sample. We hold Medicaid
eligibility rates fixed at their 2012 values so that forecasted
uninsurance rates from 2013 to 2015 do not reflect changes
in Medicaid eligibility caused by the ACA. In the case of the
3 early expansion states and the District of Columbia, eligi-
bility rates are held fixed at their preexpansion level such
that their ACA-related eligibility expansions (in 2010 for
Connecticut and District of Columbia and 2011 for California
and Minnesota) are not incorporated into the baseline predic-
tions. This means that our forecasts assume that absent the
ACA, there would have been no additional Medicaid eligi-
bility expansions.
Finally, we make a small adjustment to the predicted val-
ues to eliminate the gap between actual and predicted values
in the last year of the estimation sample. This adjustment

does not alter the forecasted percentage-point changes in the
uninsurance rates. Specifically, for young adults we add the
forecast error for that year (the difference between the actual
and predicted uninsurance rates for 2010) to the predicted
value for 2010 and each subsequent year up to 2015.
Similarly, for the 2 older age groups, we add forecast error in
2012 to the predicted values in 2012 and each following year.
Actual and forecasted uninsurance rates that assume there
is no ACA are shown in Figures 4 to 6. For low-income
adults, forecasted uninsurance rates are relatively flat to
2015, or falling slightly for all 3 age groups (Figure 4).
Despite the overall rising trend in uninsurance from 2000 to
2012, the uninsurance rate would have been expected to fall
slightly because of the falling unemployment rate. For the
middle-income group, uninsurance rates are forecast to rise
within each age group, continuing the overall trend since
2000 (Figure 5). For adults in the higher income group, fore-
casted trends assuming no ACA show a slight decline for
young adults, a flat trend for the middle age group, and a
continuation of the preexisting upward trend for the older
age group (Figure 6).
We use the forecasted uninsurance rates from 2013 and
2015 to estimate the number of uninsured adults that would
be measured by the CPS in those 2 years if there were no
ACA (and if there were no changes in how the CPS measures
the number of uninsured).13 We estimate the number of unin-
sured in each year by multiplying the forecasted number of
people by the forecasted uninsurance rate in each income-
age group in each year. We forecast the number of people in
each income-age group using regression methods similar to
those we use to compute forecasted uninsurance rates. We
estimate generalized linear regression models with a log link
(Poisson regression) of the number of people in each group
Blumberg et al. 7
at the state-year level using a linear time trend and the unem-
ployment rate (we would not expect the Medicaid eligibility
rate to have an effect on population size and exclude it from
the population models). The models also include state fixed
effects. The linear time trend captures the average annual
growth rate for the group, and the unemployment rate cap-
tures cyclical effects on the number of people in each income
group. We make a small adjustment to the predicted values to
eliminate the gap between actual and predicted values (fore-
cast error) in the last year of the estimation sample (2012).
The same adjustment is also applied to the 2013 and 2014
forecasts. For example, the predicted number of adults aged
45 to 64 with income above 400% of the FPL in 2012 was
38.1 million, compared with an estimated 39.9 million in the
CPS (a difference of 1.8 million). To make the adjustment,
we added 1.8 million people to the predicted number in 2012,
2013, and 2014. For all other demographic groups, the
adjustment amounts were smaller. We also make adjustments
to ensure that overall growth rates by age group (aggregating
over income groups) matches US Census forecasts.
The forecasted number of people in each population group,
as well as the estimated uninsurance rate and number of unin-
sured if there were no ACA, are reported for 2013 and 2015 in
Table 2. Population size forecasts show variability in rates of
growth by population segment. Within each age category, there
is the least amount of growth or negative growth for the low-
income category because of falling unemployment rates over
this period.As discussed, we predict rising rates of uninsurance
for adults in the middle-income group (without the ACA); we
predict declining or nearly flat rates of uninsurance in the low-
income group. For the high-income group, the direction of
change is mixed: Young adults are predicted to experience fall-
ing rates of uninsurance because of falling unemployment
rates. Overall, we find that the number of uninsured adults
would increase 1.2% from 2013 to 2015 without theACA, with
uninsured young adults and the oldest adults in the middle- and
high-income groups experiencing the highest rates of growth.
Combining the CPS Counterfactual With Evidence
From Quick Turnaround Tracking Surveys
The conceptual framework of our analysis is as follows.
Presume that the relative percent (not percentage point)
changes in uninsurance rates between 2013 and 2015
observed through the HRMS are correct and use them to
impute the number and rate of uninsured that would have
been observed in 2015 had the CPS continued asking the
same coverage questions in the same manner as it had in pre-
vious years. Then, using the predictive CPS-based model
described in the previous section, identify the ACA coverage
effect: the difference in the number of uninsured estimated in
2015 given implementation of the ACA compared with the
number we predict would have been uninsured had the ACA
not been implemented. The results of doing so are presented
consistent with the CPS framework.
Using information from both the HRMS and the CPS
allows us to place the 2015 findings from the HRMS track-
ing survey in the context of projected trends in coverage,
interpreting those findings in a way consistent with the CPS's
broadly familiar measures of the levels of insurance cover-
age. In this analysis, we rely upon the HRMS because its
microdata allow us to assess changes for adults in different
policy-relevant income and age groups. However, the same
approach could be used with any of the available tracking
surveys.
Although they do not provide as definitive estimates of
coverage levels as large government household surveys with
higher response rates, tracking surveys such as the HRMS
and the Gallup survey provide more timely indicators of rela-
tive changes in health insurance coverage across recent peri-
ods. Surveys such as HRMS and Gallup do not provide the
long-time trend that the CPS provides, so they cannot pick up
the effects of economic cycles and can only develop counter-
factuals based on a few years. Thus, using a timely tracking
survey in conjunction with long-term trends provided from a
federal survey such as the CPS provides an effective combi-
nation for assessing the ACA's coverage effects.
The specific steps taken to compute the ACA coverage
effect are delineated below. Hat marks (^) in the formulas
below indicate predicted values, as distinguished from val-
ues directly estimated from available data.
Step 1.As described in the previous section, we first esti-
mate regressions of the share of uninsured nonelderly adults
by age and income group to obtain parameter estimates for
how unemployment rate, Medicaid eligibility rate, and time
have historically affected the number of uninsured.
Step 2. Using the parameters estimated in step 1, we predict
the number of nonelderly adults by age and income group who
would have been uninsured in 2013 and 2015 had theACAnot
been implemented. This step was described in detail in the pre-
vious section and results are shown in Table 2. The number of
uninsured adults is represented in the formulas as
NumUninsCPS,2015,No ACA
 .
Step 3. We compute the relative change in the uninsurance
rates observed in the HRMS data between the third quarter of
2013 (before the implementation of the health insurance
marketplaces and their associated financial assistance and
the Medicaid expansion) and the first quarter of 2015 (after
the first full year of nongroup marketplace enrollment and
the second open enrollment period, 15 months of the Medic-
aid expansion and full nongroup and small group insurance
market reforms). These relative changes are computed across
the income and age groups outlined earlier in this report.
This step provides an HRMS estimate of changes in insur-
ance coverage among nonelderly adults between 2013 and
2015 for each age and income group.

Step 4.We multiply the number of individuals in each
income and age group that we predict would have been
uninsured in 2013 based on our CPS model by the
relative change in the uninsured rate observed between
2013 and 2015 in the HRMS and by the relative change in
the population size between 2013 and 2015, again by
income and age group. This step provides an estimate,
consistent with the CPS framework but relying on rela-
tive changes we observe in the HRMS, of the number of
people uninsured in 2015 under implementation of the
ACA.

Step 5. We compare the post-ACA estimates of the number
of uninsured computed in step 4 with the predicted number
of uninsured in the absence of ACA implementation from
step 2. The difference between the 2 constitutes our esti-
mated coverage effect of the ACA's main coverage
provisions.
But our estimate, which focuses on coverage changes
occurring between 2013 and 2015, does not account for
increased coverage for young adults that resulted from the
2010 extension of family coverage to nondependent young
adults on their parents' private insurance policies (both
employer and nongroup). The effect of the young adult
expansion is accounted for separately in step 6:

Step 6.Any measured change and adjustment based on
differences in uninsurance rates between 2013 and 2015
does not take into account that uninsurance rates in 2013
were lower than they would have been without the ACA
because of the expansion of private family coverage to
young adults aged 19 to 25 on their parents' policies, a
policy change implemented in 2010. We assume that the
effect of the young adult expansion was fully realized by
2012, a year in which the CPS measured insurance cover-
age consistent with its preceding years. Therefore, to esti-
mate the coverage effect of the young adult provisions, we
compared the number of uninsured young adults in the
2012 CPS with the number we predicted would be unin-
sured in 2012 using our CPS-based predictive model. As
noted, the predictive model only uses CPS data prior to
2010 for young adults because the expansion was imple-
mented late that year:

Findings: The ACA Coverage Effect
for Nonelderly Adults as of December
2015
As noted, our approach implies that the relative changes in
insurance coverage observed in the HRMS quarterly surveys
are accurate and also assumes that the levels of coverage
observed in the larger government surveys (here the CPS)
are likely to be more accurate than the levels observed in the
HRMS. We therefore translate these recently observed rela-
tive changes into the familiar historic levels of CPS cover-
age. This approach also allows us to compare 2015 predicted
levels of uninsurance based on the CPS's long-term trend
with more current information from the HRMS, creating a
consistent counterfactual: observed levels of uninsurance
under the ACA compared with predicted levels of uninsur-
ance had the ACA not been implemented.
Table 3 provides the uninsurance rates by income and cat-
egory from the HRMS data in the third quarter of 2013
(before the implementation of the ACA's central coverage
reforms) and the first quarter of 2015 (after those reforms
had been implemented and the first full year of coverage and
the second open enrollment period under the reformed non-
group insurance market had been completed). The share of
each uninsured age and income subgroup in the first quarter
of 2015 was substantially smaller than each share in 2013,
with an overall relative decline of 44%. For example, in
2013, 39.5% of low-income young adults aged 19 to 25 were
uninsured; 21.6% were uninsured in 2015, with a relative
decline in the share uninsured of 45.3%.14 For context, the
HRMS measured a 33.1% decline in the number of unin-
sured nonelderly adults between the first quarter of 2014 and
the first quarter of 2015. The relative decline as measured by
the NHIS across that same period was 29.3%.15
Table 4 shows the number of predicted uninsured absent
the ACA in each income and age category (consistent with
Table 2), the number of estimated uninsured in 2015 given
relative changes observed in the HRMS (consistent with
steps 4 and 5 described earlier), and the estimated effect of
the early young adult private coverage expansions (consis-
tent with step 6). Without the ACA, we predict that there
would have been 39.3 million uninsured nonelderly adults.
About half of the adults uninsured without reform are low
income and another 40% are middle income. Approximately
22% of uninsured adults without reform would be aged 19 to
25, 45% aged 26 to 44, and 33% aged 45 to 64.
As a consequence of the main coverage expansions taking
place, we estimate that the number of uninsured adults was
reduced by 16.9 million, to 22.5 million uninsured adults. We
10 INQUIRY
estimate that the young adult expansions implemented in
2010 reduced the number of uninsured by an additional 1.2
million adults, which is well within the range of estimates
(from around 900 000 to 2 million) produced by others using
different data and methods.12,16
The "decrease in uninsured" column shows the full esti-
mated ACA coverage effect in 2015, which accounts for the
main coverage expansions that were implemented beginning
in 2014 and the early expansion for young adults, indicating
that the ACA reduced the number of uninsured adults by an
estimated 18.1 million people by March 2015, a reduction of
approximately 46%.
The largest relative decreases in uninsured adults caused
by the ACA accrue to those in the middle-income group. The
uninsurance rate in this group fell 51%. The uninsurance rate
fell 45% in the low-income group and 34% in the high-
income group. By age category, the largest relative decreases
in the uninsured occur for the 19- to 25-year-olds and the
45- to 64-year-olds: Each fell more than 50%. The 26- to
44-year-olds saw a 37% reduction.
Limitations
As with all analyses comparing what actually happened with
estimates of what would have happened in the absence of a
policy change, this approach has limitations. First, the HRMS
estimates of the change in the uninsurance rate, like other
surveys, are subject to sampling error.17 For our estimate of a
reduction of 18.1 million in the number of uninsured people,
a 95% confidence interval based on HRMS sampling vari-
ability alone yields a range from 15.4 to 20.8 million. Second,
the counterfactual estimates of uninsurance are subject to
several sources of error, such as sampling errors in the under-
lying source of uninsurance estimates and errors in the fore-
casting model, which are harder to quantify. The forecasting
model to some degree extrapolated from past trends that may
not apply to the 2013 to 2015 period, and uncertainty around
the counterfactual forecast grows if we forecast out to subse-
quent years. Because consistent state-level time series of
Medicaid eligibility for childless adults are lacking, we could
not control for this element of Medicaid policy in the model
(this limitation would lead to more conservative estimates
that understate the effects of the ACA). Also, the model did
not explicitly account for health care cost or premium trends
or pre-ACA trends in cost sharing. These effects are captured
implicitly in the linear trends, and the effect of health care
costs on coverage could differ from 2013 to 2015 relative to
the past. Health care cost growth was at relatively low levels
in recent years, which could lead us to overestimate the
counterfactual uninsurance rates, while the sluggish labor

Discussion
Time lags in receiving data from long-standing, large federal
surveys complicate real-time estimation of the coverage
effects of full ACA implementation. Fast-turnaround house-
hold surveys have stepped in to fill some of the void in data
on recent changes to insurance coverage, but they lack the
historical data that allow analysts to account for trends that
predate the ACA, economic fluctuations, and public program
expansions when predicting how many people would be
uninsured without comprehensive health care reform. This
approach allows us to take advantage of long-term trends and
timely data on coverage changes to estimate the number of
uninsured at a point in time and compare that estimate with
expectations had the ACA not been in place. The approach
can also be applied to other federal data and other timely
surveys. Doing so would provide a range of estimates of the
overall effects of reform.
Using the CPS and the HRMS in this fashion, we estimate
that as of March 2015, the ACA reduced the number of unin-
sured adults by 18.1 million compared with the number who
would have been uninsured at that time had the law not been
implemented. That decline represents a 46% reduction in the
number of nonelderly adults without insurance, compared
with the HRMS's observed reduction of approximately 44%
(Table 3).14
It is also helpful to place this estimated reduction in the
number of uninsured in context with Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) predictions of the ACA's coverage effects to
assess the current reduction relative to expectations. The
CBO's model is based on different data still; the core of their
microsimulation model is the Survey of Income and Program
Participation. Thus, their estimated levels of the number of
uninsured are different from those produced by the CPS. But
putting expected changes into relative terms can help us
compare them with estimates of actual changes in coverage
using the data in this analysis.
According to the most recent predictions using the CBO
model, the number of uninsured adults and children was
expected to fall by 17 million people in 2015 because of the
ACA, or 33% of the estimated total uninsured absent the
ACA (52 million).18 However, the CBO baseline of 52 mil-
lion uninsured people includes both nonelderly adults and
children; our analysis includes only adults. Our rough
approximation of an expected percentage reduction in non-
elderly uninsured adults consistent with the CBO baseline is
about 47%, very close to the relative reduction computed in
our analysis. The 2009 (pre-ACA) nonelderly uninsured
were 70% adults and 30% children.7 Assuming that split
applies to the 2015 CBO baseline, 36.4 million of the 52 mil-
lion uninsured predicted in the absence of the ACA are
adults. The increase in coverage under theACAappears, thus
far, to be wholly attributable to adults, with children's cover-
age remaining unchanged.19 Attributing the CBO's predic-
tion of a 17 million person reduction to the number of
uninsured adults, a rough calculation of their predicted rela-
tive change in uninsurance among adults would be about

47% (17 million/36.4 million). The estimates generated in
our analysis indicate that the number of uninsured adults fell
46% as of March 2015 (18.1 million out of 39.3 million
anticipated without reform). Consequently, our analysis indi-
cates that the second-year effects of the ACA on insurance
coverage are in line with those predicted by the CBO; the
level of the change is different because of the differences in
the data sets used, but the relative change is consistent with
the CBO's prediction.
The third year of full ACA implementation, 2016, brings
some significant uncertainty related to potential coverage
effects. First, at least one additional state, Indiana, has cho-
sen to expand Medicaid under the law, and others might fol-
low.As the HRMS has shown, Medicaid expansion decisions
have substantially affected how much the ACA can increase
insurance in a given state.14 Second, investment in outreach
and enrollment activities appears to be waning to some
degree, and this could affect enrollment and reenrollment in
Medicaid and marketplace coverage.
Because falling unemployment rates over the 2013 to 2015
period counteracted an overall trend of rising uninsurance
rates, the forecasted uninsurance rate absent the ACA shows
little change over the 2-year period. Consequently, the practi-
cal importance of modeling and accounting for the counterfac-
tual trend turns out to be modest over this period. Over longer
periods and periods of economic instability, accounting for the
counterfactual becomes more important. When we use our
model to forecast the number of uninsured out to 2020, we
estimate there would be 42.7 million uninsured adults under a
base scenario with 5.1% unemployment, but 46.5 million
uninsured adults under 9.6% unemployment, such as was
experienced in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
