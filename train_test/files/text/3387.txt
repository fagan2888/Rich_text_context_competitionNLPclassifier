Introduction
Research in digital libraries (DLs) has gained much interest
across the globe. Since the early 1990s, a significant amount
of money has been invested in DL research (Pomerantz,
Abbas, & Mostafa, 2009; Pomerantz, Oh, Yang, Fox, &
Wildemuth, 2006). Many governments in different countries
across the world have invested in building their national
DLs. However, in the United States, DL research has
attracted much more attention and funding than other parts
of the world. A significant number of grants are awarded in
the United States to collaborative DL education projects.
For example, Institute of Museum and Library Services
(IMLS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) granted
a number of collaborative DL education projects in the
United States. A very highly significant DL curriculum proj-
ect of Virginia Tech (VT) and the University of North
Carolina (UNC) was granted a 3-year grant of over half a
million dollars in 2006. It is perhaps the first formal coop-
eration in this field between computer science (CS) and
library and information science (LIS) and between institu-
tions (Ma, Clegg, & O'Brien, 2009). This curriculum proj-
ect has affected LIS curriculum and teaching, in particular
DL curriculum across the world. Readers interested in
knowing more about the curriculum can read works of Oh,
Yang, Pomerantz, Wildemuth, and Fox (2015) and Yang,
Wildemuth, Pomerantz, Oh, and Fox (2009) and can check
their website at http://curric.dlib.vt.edu/
In Europe, there have been several projects and funding
nationally and locally that focus on DL development. The
European Commission's (EC 2009) i2010 DLs initiative
was launched in September 2005 suggesting the creation
of a European DL and the promotion of Europe-wide DL
initiatives. In November 2008, Europeana--Europe's
online library, museum, and archive--was opened to make
Europe's rich cultural and scientific heritage accessible to
all over the Internet.

Digital Library Education in
Europe: A Survey
Ragnar Andreas Audunson1 and Nafiz Zaman Shuva2,3
Abstract
Research in digital libraries (DLs) has gained much interest across the globe. Most funding related to DL are available
for building DLs, rather than producing digital librarians by developing the DL curricula and offering necessary funding to
introduce state-of-the-art DL labs for future library professionals. Based on online surveys, this article investigates the status
of DL education/courses in Europe, particularly, it examines the curriculum contents of DL courses, explores the future
direction of library and information science (LIS) curricula, and identifies the competitors of LIS schools in the DL world. This
study received responses from 54 LIS schools/departments in 27 European countries. The results of the current study clearly
show that the majority of the LIS schools have already integrated digital librarianship in their regular bachelor's and master's
degree programs. The importance of practical aspects in DL curricula has been highlighted by the authors. The study also
reports the recommended books and journals on DL, direction of LIS curricula, and the competitors of LIS schools in the
digital world. A number of future research directions have been offered by the authors. The authors expect that the study
will contribute to the discussions and debates toward identifying subject elements for DL courses. The top subject areas
based on their importance as reported by the participants of the current study should be taken into consideration before
designing curricula for DLs and before developing a Europe-wide unique LIS curriculum.

In Europe, in recognition of the importance of DL educa-
tion, EC introduced EC-financed Erasmus Mundus
International Master in Digital Library Learning (DILL) in
2007. EC financed this program for the five consecutive
years. Initially, DILL was managed by three European LIS
schools, that is, Oslo and Akershus University College of
Applied Sciences, Norway; Tallinn University, Estonia; and
Parma University, Italy. From 2015, DILL is now managed
by Tallinn University, Estonia, and Parma University, Italy.
Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences
is no more a partner of DILL. Although the EC deserves
appreciation for introducing such an internationally recog-
nized, highly acclaimed, first program of this type on DL
education, it did not extend the funding support after fifth
intake. In an effort to encourage international students to
gain DL expertise at two European LIS schools, the DILL
administration reduced the tuition fees recently. Nonetheless,
many students from developing countries still would not be
able to bear the expenses of studying at European institutions
due to high cost of living. There are very few such examples
of fully fledged programs on digital librarianship in Europe.
It is evident in the literature on DLs such as Pomerantz
et al. (2006) and Pomerantz et al. (2009) that most funding
related to DLs are available for building DLs, rather than
producing digital librarians by developing the DL curriculum
and offering necessary funding to introduce state-of-the-art
DL lab for future library professionals.
This article investigates the status of DL education/courses in
Europe, particularly, it examines the curriculum contents of DL
courses and future direction of LIS curricula, identifies the com-
petitors of LIS schools in the DL world, and so forth. Finally,
based on the online survey results, this article offers guidelines
for future curriculum development in European LIS schools.
Problem Statement
Kajberg and Lørring (2005) highlighted the importance of
joint curriculum development and collaboration and cooper-
ation among LIS schools in Europe to offer enhanced, qual-
ity LIS education in Europe. DL is an area where the LIS
schools in Europe can work together to create a standard cur-
riculum for LIS schools in Europe. Moreover, LIS schools
can also collaborate with CS, management, and business
schools to build an interdisciplinary DL curriculum.
The first step to collaboration with other LIS schools in
Europe would be to know their curricula and schools'
strengths. European countries vary from each other due to
their diverse cultural, historical, and language backgrounds.
Naturally, LIS schools in Europe have different curriculum
concentrations. Due to language variances, it is not possible
for any individual researcher to examine the curriculum con-
tents of the LIS programs based on their curricula available
online. The websites of many European countries are in their
local languages and many LIS schools have not uploaded
their curricula online. Therefore, it is not even possible for
anyone to know the LIS courses and their curricula due to
language barriers. In such a situation, the authors of this arti-
cle decided to use online surveys to acquire an understanding
of the core curriculum contents of the LIS schools on DL
courses. The heads of the LIS departments/schools are the
right persons to contact as they are responsible for oversee-
ing LIS schools' activities and have information about their
curricula and future planned initiatives.
A number of studies, such as Spink and Cool (1999),
Saracevic and Dalbello (2001), Liu (2004), and Ma, Clegg,
and O'Brien (2006), focus on exploring DL courses in vari-
ous schools around the world and explore course contents
and related things. The majority of the research on DL is con-
ducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Canada. Very little has been done in Europe that illustrates
the DL education status in the European context. Although
there might be studies conducted in languages other than in
English that talk about the importance of DLs in the LIS cur-
riculum, this study is unable to account for them. A study by
Koltay and Boda (2008) investigated the status of DL con-
cepts in the Hungarian LIS curriculum. However, Tammaro
(2007) offered several broad models of DL courses. A study
by Larsen (2005) offers a brief overview of the LIS curricu-
lum in European LIS schools, although no focus has been
given to examine the DL education­related aspects. What is
the status of DL courses in LIS schools in Europe? What are
the major curriculum contents of DL courses in European
LIS schools? What is the future direction of the LIS curricu-
lum? Do LIS faculty members in Europe prefer curricula that
focus more on practical aspects over theoretical aspects?
This article will address all these questions.
Literature Review
In this section, the authors only review the studies that are
related to DL education, particularly talk about DL curricu-
lum contents. Due to word limit and as this study is not based
on a literature review, the authors reviewed the key literature
on DL education. Only the studies published in English were
considered for this article. The authors also did not include
any discussion on library education in Europe. Readers inter-
ested in knowing more about library and information educa-
tion in Europe can read studies by Virkus (2007, 2008),
Audunson (2005), Juznic and Badovinac (2005), Kajberg,
Horvat, and Oguz (2009), Spink and Heinström (2012), and
Tammaro (2011).
Ma et al. (2009) in their article highlighted the importance
of teaching DL:
There is a clear demand for the hiring of digital librarians in
digital information management, and this is a worldwide trend;
There is increasing demand for the development of educational
DLs and other types of managed digital collections such as
Institutional Repositories. (p. 536)
Audunson and Shuva 3
A recent book by Myburgh and Tammaro (2013) dis-
cusses various areas in education for digital librarians includ-
ing curriculum design, pedagogies, and the future role of LIS
professionals.
Dahlström and Doracic (2009) examined the cultural heri-
tage (CH) digitalization education in 12 European LIS
schools in five European countries. The authors particularly
focused on the CH digitalization education at Swedish
School of Library and Information Science (SSLIS). They
highlighted the changes associated with developing and
managing CH digitization courses. In a study, Macevicit,
Wilson, and Francke (2009) illustrated the contents and
design of international master's programs in DLs and infor-
mation services at SSLIS.
Based on web analysis, one of the most cited studies on DL
education, by Saracevic and Dalbello (2001), examine the 56
LIS programs in the United States and Canada. Out of the 56
LIS programs, 47 (89%) include DL in some form or another
or to some degree in their curriculum; for 5 (9%) programs,
this cannot be determined and 4 (7%) programs show no pres-
ence of DL education. The authors conducted a detailed exam-
ination of presented curricula, course descriptions, syllabi, and
other information on the LIS programs studied.
Abrizah, Noorhidawati, Hilmi, and Azeana (2009) exam-
ined 13 LIS schools in the United States, the United Kingdom,
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand offering DL courses.
They found that out of the 13 LIS schools, six schools were
offering an independent or a full DL course, three were offer-
ing a DL course integrated with other topics, and four were
offering courses that cover processes that are closely related to
DLs such as digital curation and digitization of archives. The
authors also reported the DL education scenario in Malaysia.
Interdisciplinary curriculum development has received
much interest and attention recently after the curriculum devel-
opment project of VT-UNC Digital Library Curriculum. This
was funded by the NSF through Grants NSF IIS-0535057 (to
VT) and IIS-0535060 (to the UNC at Chapel Hill [UNC-CH]),
and builds upon a collaboration between VT and the UNC-CH
(DigitalLibraryCurriculumProject,2009).TheVTDepartment
of Computer Science and the UNC-CH School of Information
and Library Science developed curricular materials for DL
education, appropriate for the CS and LIS communities (Yang,
Fox, Wildemuth, Pomerantz, & Oh, 2006).
Interdisciplinary curriculum and its related areas have
been studied by a number of authors, such as Spink and Cool
(1999), Coleman (2002), Pomerantz (2008), Yang et al.
(2007), Yang et al. (2009), and Weech (2005). Pomerantz
(2008), Yang et al. (2007), and Yang et al. (2009) being
involved with the VT Department of Computer Science and
the UNC-CH School of Information and Library Science DL
Curriculum Development project reported the progress with
the interdisciplinary curriculum development, experts opin-
ion about curriculum contents, and different related aspects.
Using email, surveys, and website analysis of LIS schools,
Spink and Cool (1999) described the state of DL research
including the state of the art in DL education worldwide. The
authors highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary DL
curriculum development to succeed in DL world.
Coleman (2002) reviewed studies related to education in
DLs and curriculum planning from professional associations
in LIS and CS. The author highlighted the importance of
interdisciplinary curriculum development.
Liu (2004), like Saracevic and Dalbello (2001), carried
out an Internet survey on 42 schools offering a DL course
worldwide, though the majority of schools analyzed were
North American LIS schools. The author highlighted the
importance of practical DL courses in LIS schools. Ma et al.
(2006) reported the status of DL education in the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Their findings
indicated a well acceptance of DL courses in different LIS
schools studied. Ma et al. (2006) also highlighted the impor-
tance of designing a DL curriculum based on a combination
of practical and theoretical knowledge.
Choi and Rasmussen (2006) conducted a study on DL
practitioners to understand what is needed to train future LIS
professionals. The findings of their study emphasize the need
for technical, practical DLcourses in LIS schools. Isfandyari-
Moghaddam and Bayat (2008), after reviewing studies by
Marion (2001), Deegan and Tanner (2001), Bawden et al.
(2005), Zhou (2005), Chang and Hopkinson (2006), Choi
and Rasmussen (2006), and so forth, identified 21 skills that
DL professionals need to work efficiently in DL world.
Based on online questionnaires, Howard (2009) identified
skills and knowledge required to work in a DL environment.
She found that skills such as communication, critical think-
ing, and the need to be flexible were required in the DL envi-
ronment. The participants of her study regarded user needs,
metadata, and copyright as highly desirable knowledge
areas, whereas digital repositories and legal issues were con-
sidered important issues to be covered in a DL education pro-
gram by the participants of the study.
Based on the opinions of Norwegian and Thai LIS educa-
tors, Nonthacumjane (2010) identified the essential compe-
tencies for DL professionals. The author reported a number
of competencies a digital librarian requires to work in the
DL world. Ratzek (2009), after examining the LIS programs
in Germany, in the Nordic Countries, and the United
Kingdom, reported the availability of technology-based
courses, including digital document handling, library soft-
ware, information retrieval, and so forth, in the programs
studied. He thought that LIS schools in Europe are ready to
face the digital challenges.
Koltay and Boda (2008) carried out a study to explore the
DL curriculum in Hungarian LIS schools. They identified the
following 15 DL curriculum elements: collection develop-
ment; historical studies; information retrieval and information
seeking; information technology; metadata; interoperability;
interface design; legal issues; electronic publishing, scholarly
communication; digitization; preservation; reference services;
the digital librarian; information literacy; and research.

In a study, Tammaro (2007) offered several broad models
of DL courses:
(1) technology as a tool for the building of digital libraries and
the courses'focus on technological infrastructure and processes;
(2) digital libraries as environments concerned with the social
and cultural contexts that digital libraries reside in;
(3) the digital library as composed of objects with the main
focus on the management of the life-cycle of documents and
artefacts in the digital environment; and
(4) a combined model that includes different perspectives on the
subject. (p. 230)
A workshop titled "Coordinating EU-US Digital Library
Education" was held in the United States at the UNC cam-
pus, in November 2008 to discuss the necessity and possibil-
ity of EU-U.S. coordination in DL education. A Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis
was done by the workshop participants. A brief description
of the SWOT analysis is given at the top of this page
(Pomerantz et al., 2009).
Sadly, no further progress on the initiative was found.
However, if the initiative had been successful, it would have
brought significant changes and progress in LIS education in
European LIS schools.
Ratzek (2009) concluded that "there is a certain danger--
especially in the field of `libraries'--that librarians become
job creators for computer scientists whereas the need for
librarians is shrinking at the same time (e.g., in Germany)"
(p. 517). The author emphasized the importance of
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in LIS
curriculum if future LIS professionals want to succeed in the
digital revolution.
In this brief literature review, the authors reviewed studies
related to DL education, competencies required to work in new
digital world, recommended curriculum contents, and so on.
The need for practical curriculum contents has been high-
lighted by the authors of various studies in DL education
reviewed in this section. The authors contended that the
creation of interdisciplinary curriculum particularly with CS
would help LIS professionals prepare themselves for the future
digital world.An ideal DL curriculum should focus much more
on practical aspects. That being said, theoretical aspects of DLs
as well as special focus on user behavior and user preferences
should also receive priority when designing DL curriculum.
Method
Based on online surveys, this study examines the DL courses
in European LIS schools, curriculum contents of DL courses,
and its related areas.
Bryman (2008), one of the most prominent authors of
social research methods, defines survey as
a cross-sectional design in relation to which data are collected
predominantly by questionnaire or by structure interview on
more than one case (usually quite a lot more than one) and at a
single point in time in order to collect quantitative and qualitative
data in connection with two or more variables (usually many
more than two), which are then examined to detect patterns of
association. (p. 46)
According to Burkell (2003), "surveys are an excellent
method of collecting information about the opinions and
experience of research participants. Surveys are among the
most widely used methods in LIS research" (p. 239).
A questionnaire consisting of both open and closed ques-
tions was prepared for the study. Although to save the time of
the respondents and to analyze the data efficiently, the major-
ity of the questions were closed. This study obtained data
that are both qualitative and quantitative in nature.
Three directories were used to identify the email addresses
and websites of LIS schools in Europe:
1. European Association of Library & Information
Education and Research (EUCLID) Directory (avail-
able at http://euclid-lis.eu/ )
2. International Federation of Library Associations and

3. British Association for Information and Library
Education and Research (BAILER) Members
Directory (available at http://www.bailer.ac.uk/mem-
bership/member-directory/; for locating LIS schools/
departments in the United Kingdom).
The authors identified 159 LIS schools in Europe from
these directories. The information on the LIS schools in the
following countries was not found in the IFLA and EUCLID
directory: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Cyprus, Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Georgia, Liechtenstein,
Luxembourg, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, and Vatican
City State.
Out of 49 European Countries, the authors identified infor-
mation on LIS schools of 37 European countries. Therefore,
the LIS schools in 37 European countries were considered for
this study.
It was not feasible for the authors to visit even a single
LIS school from each European country due to lack of time
and limited funding; therefore, online surveys were suitable
for this type of study. Online questionnaires are economi-
cally beneficial as they do not require a postal charge, paper
and printing of questionnaires, or resending charge.
Moreover, through online surveys, it is feasible to reach a
wider audience that otherwise would not be possible due to
distance and other barriers. Most importantly, results of the
online surveys are easy to organize, edit, present, and publish
reports. This study utilized the online survey tool QuestBack
(http://www.questback.com), as it was subscribed by Oslo
University College, Norway (now Oslo and Akershus
University College of Applied Sciences).
An online questionnaire was designed to understand the
state of DL education in European LIS schools and to answer
other research questions such as "What is the direction of
LIS curriculum?" and "Who are the competitors of LIS
schools in the DL world?" Using the facility at QuestBack,
the authors prepared two questionnaires with one question-
naire consisting of 26 questions for all European countries
except the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the other one
consisting of 24 questions for the United Kingdom and
Ireland. Two questions, that is, "Do you have a course in
English? If yes, please select whether English is used for
individual courses, a bachelor's level course, master's
degree, PhD," were omitted for the United Kingdom and
Ireland as the main language of these countries is English.
The online questionnaire used for the current study was
divided into following sections:
·
·  Demographic information
·
·  Digital library courses in LIS schools in Europe
·
·  Major contents of existing DL curriculum in Europe
·
·  Major reading materials as part of DL courses
·
· 
Subject preference of the respondents as part of DL
education
·
·  Priority of DL curriculum
·
·  Direction of LIS curriculum
·
·  Competitors of LIS schools in the DL world
·
· 
Perceptions of digital librarianship among the
respondents
·
· 
Definition of DLs by the representative of the LIS
schools in Europe.
A pilot study was conducted on some International
Master in Digital Library Learning (DILL) professors in
three different countries and DILL students to check whether
the online system was functioning properly and to obtain
comments/suggestions about the questionnaire. Based on
the pilot study, revision was done on the questionnaire pre-
pared for the study.
All respondents of the current study were fully informed
about the purposes and expected benefits of the study.
Confidentiality was ensured in this study. No personal iden-
tifying data related to respondents, for example, email
address, designation, organization, were revealed. The
respondents were given the email addresses of the authors if
they required any further clarification or if they had any con-
cerns about the study.
Using QuestBack online questionnaire facility, the authors
sent 159 emails on the evening of March 16, 2011. The initial
deadline for the submission of the questionnaire was April 5,
2011. The study deadline was extended to April 15, 2011.
Three reminder emails were sent to the heads of the 159 LIS
schools in Europe.
Findings of the Study
Out of the 159 emails sent, the authors received 56 com-
pleted questionnaires. Of 56 questionnaires, two question-
naires were rejected as in one questionnaire it was clear that
the respondent misunderstood the questions and the other
questionnaire was incomplete (blank submission). As a
result, the total response for this study is 54 (33.96%) that
represents 54 LIS schools/departments in 27 European coun-
tries. The names of the universities and their corresponding
countries are presented in Appendix A.
Not all questions were answered by all respondents.
Therefore, the percentages were calculated on the basis of
the number of respondents who answered each question.
Respondents' Background and Profiles of the LIS
Schools in Europe that Participated in This Study
Most of the heads of the LIS schools in Europe answered the
questionnaires by themselves. However, in a few cases, the
heads of the schools forwarded the questionnaires to persons
who were in charge of DL courses or who were teaching
digital librarianship.
Academic positions and academic degrees of the respondents.
Out of 54 LIS faculty members who participated in this
6 SAGE Open
study, the majority of the participants were professors (38,
70.4%). Four respondents were associate professors, five
were assistant professors, and the three respondents indi-
cated that they were lecturers. One respondent was senior
lecturer, while three respondents did not indicate their aca-
demic position. The majority of the respondents, that is, 48
(89%) out of 54, had a PhD degree.
Names of the degrees LIS schools in Europe are currently awarding.
It is important to know the degree awarding status of LIS
schools in Europe. Therefore, one question was introduced to
see the existing degrees being awarded by LIS schools in
Europe. Table 1 indicates the LIS degrees being awarded by the
LIS schools in Europe that participated in the study.
Courses in English. This question was asked to the representa-
tives of the LIS schools except the LIS schools in the United
Kingdom and Ireland. Therefore, out of 54 LIS schools, 49
were given the question whether they have LIS courses in
English or not. Out of the 49 European LIS institutions, 47
LIS schools responded to this question.
Table 2 illustrates that the majority of the LIS schools
participated in this study offer LIS courses in English in
addition to the courses in their local languages. This ensures
the future possibility of internationalization in LIS schools
in Europe and collaboration with LIS schools in other
countries.
How Is Digital Librarianship Integrated Into
Educational Program?
The intention of asking the question was to identify the posi-
tion of DL courses in the LIS curriculum. Do LIS schools
have special focus on digital librarianship? Does digital
librarianship integrated into the curriculum? Or, do LIS
schools have a separate degree on digital librarianship? The
answers to these questions are summarized in Table 3.
It is evident in Table 3 that the majority of the European
LIS schools, that is, 43 (80%), integrated the concepts of
DLs into their bachelor's and master's degrees. This indi-
cates the positive integration of the concept of DLs into the
LIS curriculum in Europe. The majority of the LIS schools
in Europe have realized the importance of having DLs in the
curriculum and integrated the concept. Therefore, it is evi-
dent that LIS schools in Europe are moving toward the right
direction. Moreover, 9 (17%) LIS schools were offering
separate degree programs in DLs. From the data set, the
authors found that one LIS school each in Croatia, Estonia,
Italy, Norway, and Sweden, two LIS schools in Spain, and
two LIS schools in the United Kingdom were offering sepa-
rate degree programs in DLs. LIS schools in Estonia, Italy,
and Norway were part of the Erasmus Mundus program
named International Master in Digital Library Learning.
However, out of 54 LIS schools, 8 (15%) schools had no
special focus on DLs. Although the concept of DLs and its
related areas are now considered as one of the core concepts
of librarianship, there are LIS schools which are still unable
to properly integrate the emerging concepts of digital librar-
ianship. Research is needed to identify why LIS schools are
unable to integrate emerging LIS concepts in the age of
computers.
Major DL Topics and DL Education Subject
Preference
Europe consists of different countries having different offi-
cial languages. It would not be virtually possible for the
authors to translate the course contents of LIS schools nor be
possible for the respondents of the study to translate their
curriculum into English for the purpose of this study. To
make things easier for the respondents and to serve the pur-
pose of the current study, respondents were asked to write
three major areas/topics of DL courses present in their cur-
riculum. Out of 54 respondents, 45 respondents wrote the
major contents of the DL courses. For the purpose of under-
standing the major contents of the DL courses and for clarity,
the authors organized the major contents of DL courses on

the basis of the number of times they have been mentioned
by the respondents. Thirteen major topics of DL courses are
illustrated in Figure 1.
As evident in Figure 1, the highest ranking DL topic in the
DL course curriculum in Europe is "definition, history and
development of DL." It is mentioned 15 times by respon-
dents of the current study. Second top topics of DL courses
are "access and usage of DL" and "DL software." They are
mentioned 14 times each. Third top position is taken by three
areas "digitization and preservation," "metadata," and
"development and management of DL." In terms of the num-
ber of respondents who mentioned topics, "DL collection
building and management" and "DL usability and interface"
received the fourth position. Copyright and intellectual prop-
erty right issues are very important in DL environment. This
along with other content areas, that is, "design and evalua-
tion of DL," "information architecture," "role of DL in soci-
ety," and "DL standard" are placed in the fifth position.
Surprisingly, information architecture, social role of DLs,
and design and evaluation are ranked so low. These are top-
ics of strategic importance. The five top ranked areas pre-
sented in this study are also present in different sections of
the DL curriculum developed by VT and the UNC-CH, USA.
A careful analysis of the DL course contents mentioned
by the respondents of the current study indicates that there is
no single topic that everyone mentioned. This is an indica-
tion of diverse areas taught as part of DL courses in European
LIS schools. Research is needed to examine the curriculum
contents of DL courses offered at different LIS schools in
Europe in much more detail and to see whether LIS curricula
in particular DL-related curricula are diverse or there are
some areas where the majority of LIS schools have similar
concentrations.
The respondents of the current study were given 24 sub-
jects areas and asked to rate the importance of these subject
areas based on their importance in DL education/courses.
Table 4 presents the DL education/courses areas ranked on
the basis of their importance as indicated by the respondents.
The list of these 24 areas was developed on the basis the cur-
riculum of DILL, Digital Library Curriculum Project of VT
and the UNC-CH, DL curriculum of LIS schools in North
America, and in consultation with professors at DILL.
As evident in Table 4, out of 54 respondents 53 respon-
dents rated most of the subjects mentioned in the table.
However, the subject Internet Studies was rated by 49
respondents. Some subjects were rated by 52 respondents.
Four subject areas "digital library architecture and design,"
"information retrieval," "digital archiving," and "electronic
collection and resources development" were considered
extremely important and very important by the respondents
of the current study in terms of their importance to DL edu-
cation.Although the topic architecture and design (see Figure
1) was ranked low in major contents of DL education in
Europe, in terms of its importance, it is one of the top impor-
tant subject areas for DL curriculum. LIS educators and cur-
riculum developers can keep in mind the top ranked 10
subject areas indicated by the respondents of the study when
designing separate DL program or developing DL courses in
their departments/schools.
Core Reading in DL Education in Europe
The respondents of the current study were asked to write the
names of two books and three journals in DLs they would
recommend. The intention was to investigate the core books
and journals in DLs in Europe. The answers to these ques-
tions are presented as follows.
Books.Out of 54 respondents, 33 respondents wrote the
names of books in DLs they would recommend. There is a
tendency among participants of any study to avoid open-
ended questions due to several factors including time required
to answer open-ended questions. As indicated in Table 5,
national textbooks on DLs were mentioned by 10 respondents

of the study. The national textbooks on DLs were mentioned
by respondents from Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary,
Portugal, Poland, and Russia. This is reasonable as Europe
consists of several countries with different languages than
English. Not all LIS schools will follow English books.
Rather for greater understanding of emerging academic areas,
some students would prefer to read books in their native lan-
guages. The result on recommended books on DLs also
indicates the importance of local DL books in some European
countries. As we know, publishers usually publish books in
subject areas that are in high demands and are profitable. The
authors do not know whether the books were published by
local publishers or by authors but the authors assume that
high demands for the books in DLs resulted in local book
publication. The results in this section also indicate the fast
growing reliability and dependency on national textbooks.

As evident in Table 5, the national textbooks recom-
mended by respondents from Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany,
Hungary, Portugal, Poland, and Russia are in top position
among the books recommended by other respondents. This
indicates a growing reliability and dependency on the
national textbooks published in different countries and in
different languages. This also indicates the importance of
the DL aspects at the national level. It is logical to think that
the books written in national languages might be based on
the popular international books on DLs. This study clearly
indicates the fact that there are good numbers of books on
DLs published in different languages and in different
European countries.
The authors listed the recommended local books in DLs
under National Textbooks and listed all English books indi-
vidually on the basis of the number of times they were men-
tioned by the respondents. Table 5 illustrates the list of eight
books ranked in fifth position as recommended books in DL
education with their numbers of occurrences. Other books
recommended by the LIS faculty members of European LIS
schools are presented in Appendix B.
While analyzing the data on textbooks on DL education,
Liu (2004) found that a book written by Lesk (1997) titled
Practical Digital Libraries: Books, Bytes and Bucks was the
most popular and found in the syllabi of seven schools. A
book by Borgman (2000) titled From Gutenberg to the
Global Information Structure: Access to Information in the
Networked world and Arms's (2000) Digital Libraries are
second and third, respectively, most popular in courses on
DL. William Y. Arms's book titled Digital Libraries was rec-
ommended by the second highest number of respondents of
the current study, which was in third position in Liu's find-
ings. It is clear that Borgman's book titled From Gutenberg
to the Global Information Structure: Access to Information
in the Networked World took second position in Liu's study
and third position in the current study.
A similar study was conducted by Pomerantz et al. in
2006. In their article, they listed the five most frequently
assigned books in DL courses. These were as follows:
·
· Witten, I. H., & Bainbridge, D. (2003). How to build a
digital library. San Francisco, CA: Morgan Kaufman.

·
· Chowdhury, G. G., & Chowdhury, S. (2003).
Introduction to digital libraries. London, England:
Facet.
All these books were also mentioned by the respondents
of the current study as recommended books on digital
librarianship and placed in among the five top recommended
books. Therefore, it can be said that faculty members of
European LIS schools are aware of popular books in DL.
However, the answer to the question whether there are any
books on DLs that might be considered as core books and
recommended by the majority of the respondents of the cur-
rent study is "No." There was no book on DLs that was rec-
ommended by the majority of the respondents. But there
were some international books that were popular and recom-
mended by a number of respondents.
One of the very prominent faculty members in the field of
digital librarianship and head of a LIS school in Europe
thinks that scholarly discourse of DLs is in journal articles.
In his words, "There are really no books on digital libraries
that I recommend. The scholarly discourse is entirely in jour-
nal articles. Bill Arms old book on digital libraries is still
useful, though."
Another respondent also wrote about suggesting students
to analyze journal articles instead of books. Another respon-
dent wrote, "No particular recommendation, would direct
students to current listings like Facet Publishing (London),
Ashgate, Chandos." These are undoubtedly good approaches
of directing students to the current listing and journals. As a
result, students would be able to know the current trends,
publication in the field of their study, and be updated always
with the development in their field of studies.
Journals.Thirty-five respondents wrote the names of the
journals in DLs they would recommend. The result was quite
interesting. They wrote the names of several journals they
consider worthy for studies on DLs. Table 6 shows the list of
journals recommended by the European faculty members for
DL course.
As evident in Table 6, D-Lib Magazine was mentioned
by the highest numbers of respondents. D-Lib Magazine is
an electronic publication with a focus on DL research and
development, including new technologies, applications,
and contextual social and economic issues. After D-Lib,
the second position was taken by national journals recom-
mended by respondents from Croatia, Czech Republic,
Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Spain. Like national textbooks,
this again indicates the availability of local journals that
cover DL aspects as well as the reliability and dependency
of the European faculty members on the national journals
published in their native languages. Library Hi Tech was in
third position. Fourth position was taken by International
Journal on Digital Libraries. Fifth position was taken by
journal The Electronic Library. Journal of the American
Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST;
now Journal of the Association for Information Science
and Technology) and Ariadne jointly took the sixth posi-
tion. Journal of Documentation (JDoc) was in seventh
position. New Library and Information Processing &
Management are jointly in eighth position. Other nine
journals are in ninth position.
10 SAGE Open
Interestingly, the top five journals are journals with a low
impact. In the Norwegian and Danish incentive system for
scientific publishing, journals are grouped in two categories,
1 and 2. Category 1 consists of low-impact journals, whereas
Category 2 consists of the most prestigious journals. Not
more than 20% of the journals in a given field (e.g., LIS) can
be in Category 2. In LIS, journals such as JASIST, Information
Processing & Management, and JDoc are in Category 2;
they are all below top 5 in our ranking. The top 5 are all in
Category 1.
Pomerantz et al. (2006) analyzing the curriculum of DL
course identified 121 journals. Out of that, they listed top 13
most frequently assigned journals in DL courses. Among the
13 journals listed by Pomerantz et al. (2006), respondents of
current study recommended eight journals. D-Lib Magazine
is in the top position for both the current study and the study
conducted by Pomerantz et al. (2006).
According to Bearman (2007),
the core journals on digital libraries include College & Research
Libraries, Communications of the ACM, Electronic Library,
Information Processing and Management, Information
Technology and Libraries, the Journal of the American Society
for Information Science and Technology, Library Trends, and
Online Information Review. Bearman thinks that the
International Journal on Digital Libraries has served as a venue
for important articles from time to time. (p. 225, para. 2)
The respondents of the current study recommended five out
of nine core journals mentioned by Bearman.
One observation that is evident in the current study is that
there was no single journal on digital librarianship that was
recommended by a majority of the European LIS faculty
members. Except for D-Lib, most of the journals were rec-
ommended by few respondents. However, there was also a
clear indication of the increasing dependency on national
journals on digital librarianship.
Practical Aspects Versus Theoretical Aspects
While designing a DL curriculum, we can choose between
giving priority to practical aspects or to theoretical
aspects. Usually, DL courses conducted by CS and engi-
neering faculty are composed of more practical aspects
than theoretical aspects. It is evident in the Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM) and Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computing Curricula
2001 that there is one elective course on DL that mainly
focuses on the practical aspects of DLs. DL courses
offered by LIS schools tend to concentrate more on theo-
retical aspects than practical. It is important to see the
preferences of European LIS faculty members regarding
DL course curricula. Do they prefer more practical aspects
or do they prefer theoretical aspects? Their preferences
are illustrated in Figure 2.
As shown in Figure 2, the question on practical aspects or
theoretical aspects was answered by 51 respondents out of 54.
If the faculty members were given the option to choose only
one aspect either practical or theoretical, 32 (63%) respon-
dents would choose practical aspects, whereas 19 (37%)
respondents would choose theoretical aspects. This result
indicates the importance of practical aspects in DL courses
and gives us direction for developing DLcurricula. Liu (2004)
concluded,
as the whole area of digital libraries is presently growing at a
fantastic rate, those students who have received practical
experience with digital libraries, such as those provided in the
"hands-on" courses, appear to be the best served for future
practice in the field of librarianship. (p. 67)

As reported by Ma et al. (2006), many attendees of Joint
Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL '05) workshop on
DL education were strongly in favor of integrating hands-on
training in working DLs as part of the curriculum, although
others proposed a hybrid curriculum to bring together
strengths from diverse departments. The preference of prac-
tical aspects in DL curriculum by the faculty members of the
LIS schools who participated in this study is noticeable in the
DL education subject area preferences (see Table 4).
Direction of LIS Curriculum
It is evident in the recent curriculum of LIS that it comprises
a number of subject areas that originated from CS, media and
communication, management, and so forth. After the emer-
gence of web technologies and new model of information
management and services and evolution of DLs, LIS curri-
cula integrated a great deal of subject contents from CS.
Recent influence of various subjects on LIS curriculum is
evident in the curricula of LIS schools around the globe.
It is time to think the future directions of LIS curricula.
Are we moving toward CS, management science, social sci-
ence, or cultural science? Influences of other disciplines on
LIS curricula are obvious. A question was asked to acquire
the opinion of the European LIS faculty members about the
future direction of LIS curriculum in this study. Out of 54
respondents, 52 respondents indicated their opinion.
Figure 3 illustrates the future direction of LIS curricula
according to the opinion of faculty members of the LIS
schools in Europe who participated in this study.
As shown in Figure 3, 37 (71%) respondents out of 52 were
of the opinion that LIS curricula are moving toward CS. This
means that the majority of the LIS faculty members agree with
the fact that DL is drawing LIS/information science (LIS/IS)
curricula in the direction of CS and engineering. If we exam-
ine the current LIS curricula in different LIS schools around
the world, we will surely find that LIS schools have already
integrated several courses that originated from CS. Out of 52
respondents, 35 (67%) respondents thought that the direction
of LIS curricula is management science. Knowledge manage-
ment and other aspects of management related to library and
information centers are already present in LIS curricula of dif-
ferent LIS schools. Twenty-four respondents (46%) were of
the opinion that DL is drawing LIS/IS curriculum in the direc-
tion of social science and only 14 (27%) respondents were of
the opinion that DL is drawing LIS/IS curriculum in the direc-
tion of cultural science.
The result of the direction of LIS curricula indicates two
obvious future directions of LIS curricula. Future LIS curri-
cula will reasonably be directed toward CS and engineering
as well as management science. Presumably, LIS curricula
will be influenced by many subject areas in future, some of
which may have not emerged yet. Robot technology, space
science, and satellite technology may have future influence
on LIS curriculum. In future, the LIS discipline will focus
more on technology than any other thing. Libraries and LIS
discipline will never disappear. Instead, the LIS discipline
will marry many subject areas to ensure its presence in the
future information world. LIS discipline will be shaped and
reshaped according to the demands of the world.
Digital Librarianship
One question was introduced to see how European LIS faculty
members considered digital librarianship. Is digital librarian-
ship the librarianship in the digital age or is it a separate emerg-
ing discipline distinct from librarianship or is it a mixture of
both? The answers to the question are presented in Table 7.
Figure 3. Direction of LIS curriculum.
Note. Multiple responses allowed. LIS = library and information science.
12 SAGE Open
The majority of the European LIS faculty members, that
is, 34 (63%) participants in this study, considered "digital
librarianship" as a mixture of librarianship in the digital age
and a separate emerging discipline. Out of 54 respondents,
18 (33%) respondents considered it "Librarianship in the
Digital Age" and two (4%) respondents considered it as a
separate emerging discipline distinct from librarianship.
LIS professionals, researchers, and library thinkers are not
in a position to argue that DLs and digital librarianship are
completely librarianship in the digital age and the sole prod-
uct of the library field, nor can they say that they are a com-
pletely separate discipline, distinct from librarianship. In one
sense, digital librarianship is librarianship in the digital age,
and in another sense, digital librarianship is a separate emerg-
ing discipline developing with the support of mainly CS peo-
ple. DL curricula in LIS schools on one hand include digital
ethics, user behaviors, digital literacy, freedom of information
as well as other areas derived from traditional librarianship.
On the other hand, DL curricula include database manage-
ment, software programming, web design, and other areas
derived from CS. Therefore, digital librarianship is a mixture
of both librarianship and separate emerging discipline.
Competitors of LIS Schools in DL World
Yang, Wildemuth, Pomerantz, Oh, and Fox (2009) noted that
several disciplines have an interest in the development of a
graduate-level curriculum for DL education. Most DL
courses have been taught either in LIS or CS programs (Ma
et al., 2009). A question was asked to the European LIS fac-
ulty to identify the competitors of LIS schools in the case of
DL course offering. In this question, three kinds of schools
were specified as potential competitors of LIS schools in the
DL world. These were "computer science and engineering
(CSE) schools," "management science and business schools,"
and "communications and media schools." The respondents
were given five options to select from, namely, (a) very
strong competitor, (b) strong competitor, (c) competitor, (d)
not strong competitor, and (e) not competitor at all.
The authors combined the very strong competitor, strong
competitor, and competitor ratings of the respondents to
identify the true competitors of LIS schools in DL world.
Table 8 presents competitors of LIS schools in the DL world.
Table 8 shows that the majority of LIS faculty members,
that is, 42 (78%), considered CSE schools as the greatest
competitors of LIS schools in DL world, while second high-
est numbers of respondents, that is, 40 (70%), considered
communications and media schools as competitors of the
LIS schools in DL world. Out of 53 respondents, 29 (55%)
respondents considered management science and business
schools as competitors of LIS schools in the DL world.
Ratzek (2009) thought that "there is a certain danger-
especially in the field of `libraries'that librarians become job
creators for computer scientist whereas the need for librarian
is shrinking at the same time (e.g., in Germany)" (p. 517).
Will the competitors of LIS schools grab the LIS discipline?
Will LIS discipline become unnecessary for the future informa-
tion world? What should we do to secure our discipline for the
future competitive academic world? LIS faculty members
should keep these questions in mind and should design the LIS
curriculum in a way that meets the requirements of the new
market and include the necessary knowledge and skills to be
very competent in the future information world.
Future Research Directions
A separate study to explore the DL curriculum/courses in the
CS schools of European countries may be conducted using
the methodologies and questionnaire used for the current
study. Comparative studies of trends and state of the art in DL
education in the Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Northern
Europe, and Southern Europe might also be conducted fol-
lowing the same methodologies applied to this study.
Astudy to assess the European DL practitioners'preferences
about DL course contents is a very important research area that
should be considered by the researchers in DLarena to know the
skills and knowledge required in the DL world. An in-depth
focus group study with the DLresearchers and faculty members
is also feasible to find out their perceptions, choice, and other
related issues in relation to DL. Studies on DLeducation­related
aspects in other regions and countries in the world may follow
the methodologies and research problems and related things like
the current study in conducting a similar type of study. For
example, a similar type of study to explore the state of the art in
DLeducation in SouthAsian,Arabian, orAfrican countries may
easily be conducted using the methodologies used for the cur-
rent study with necessary modifications.
A separate study to explore the DL curriculum in the CSE
schools of European countries may be conducted using the
methodologies and questionnaire used for the current study.

Audunson and Shuva 13
A separate comprehensive study that focuses on the DL cur-
riculum contents of the LIS schools is worth conducting. A
comparative study of trends and state of the art in DL educa-
tion in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Northern Europe,
and Southern Europe might also be conducted following the
same methodologies applied to this study.
A collaborative study is warranted in European context.
Researchers from different European countries can conduct
studies to examine LIS education, particularly DL education
in various European countries. For example, researchers
from Baltic countries can collaborate with researchers from
Nordic countries to report the LIS education in Baltic and
Nordic countries. A separate study can also be conducted to
explore the perceptions of LIS education among the LIS fac-
ulty members in European countries. What is the future of
LIS education? What is the direction of LIS education in
Europe? What are the important subject areas LIS schools
should integrate into their curricula? What should be done to
secure the position of LIS in the future information world?
A web content analysis of LIS courses, programs, and
research concentrations can be done to assess the status of
LIS schools in Europe and their research areas. What are the
key courses that LIS schools in Europe are offering? Are
there any core courses that are offered by the LIS schools in
Europe? What are the research concentrations of LIS schools
in Europe? Are LIS schools in Europe different in terms of
research concentration? Is there any regional or local influ-
ence on research concentration? For example, Nordic coun-
tries may have special concentration or interest in conducting
research about them or in areas that benefit them.
A separate study, utilizing qualitative interview tech-
niques, can be conducted to obtain the perceptions of LIS
education in Europe among the prominent LIS scholars, aca-
demics, and leaders of professional associations in Europe.
What is the status of LIS education in Europe? What should
be done to increase internationalization of LIS education in
Europe? What should be done to develop joint LIS pro-
grams? What is the future of LIS education in Europe? What
should be done to improve the status of LIS education in
Europe and to produce future qualified information profes-
sionals? What role can LIS associations play to increase the
collaboration and cooperation among LIS schools and to
develop a standardized LIS curriculum across Europe?
A study can be conducted to explore the outcome of DILL
or other DL courses offered at various European LIS schools.
What are the job status/positions of students of DILL course?
Are they working in the DL sector? Does DILL help them
getting a decent job? Do they face any problem working in
the DL world? Does the curriculum of DILL match with the
practical needs of DLs? Do they have any recommendation
for future improvement of the course?
A study to explore the internationalization of LIS educa-
tion in Europe would be worth taking. What is the current
state of internationalization at various LIS schools in Europe?
Do they offer English courses at different program levels? Do
they have English websites? Do they have English version of
their curricula? How many international students do they
admit each year? Do they have any collaborative master's or
doctoral programs with European LIS schools and with inter-
national LIS schools? What is the current faculty strength of
LIS schools in Europe? How many of them have PhD from
foreign countries? How many of them are experts in emerg-
ing LIS areas including DLs, digital humanities, and so on?
How many of them can teach in English? This study can be
conducted with the help of the heads/directors of the LIS
schools in Europe. A questionnaire can be prepared and sent
to the representatives of LIS schools in Europe for their input.
Conclusion
This study has attempted to fill some gaps in research on DL
education and related areas in Europe. The study reports the
existing curriculum contents of surveyed European LIS schools
and the preferences of DL curriculum among the faculty mem-
bers who participated in this study. It is found that the majority
of the LIS schools in Europe that participated in this study have
already integrated the DLconcepts in their curricula. Moreover,
nearly 20% of LIS schools indicated that they have separate DL
degree program. The DL course contents of the LIS schools in
Europe are diverse and the importance of practical DL course
contents has been highlighted by the participants of the study.
The study also reports the growth of national textbooks on
DLs and the importance of national level journals for DL
courses in a number of LIS schools in Europe. Although a
number of English textbooks and journals were recommended
by a number of faculty members for DL courses, the study did
not find any core DL textbooks and journals for DL courses.
Based on the results, the study finds a number of directions
for the LIS curricula. Two obvious directions for LIS curricula
would be moving toward CS and engineering as well as man-
agement. Moreover, nearly 50% of European faculty members
who participated in this study think that LIS curricula are
moving toward social science. The study asserts that in future,
LIS curricula will take different directions to meet the demands
of the time and the profession. Presumably, modern technolo-
gies will have high influence on LIS curricula. The need for
collaboration among different discipline has also been high-
lighted in this study. Based on the results obtained, the authors
contend that the future LIS education will consist of more of
collaborative programs with several disciplines including CS,
management, culture science, and so on. The study also
emphasizes the need for Europe-wide DL/LIS curriculum.
The authors expect that the results obtained as part of this
study will be of interest to DL researchers, educationalists,
and policy makers in European countries as well as around
the world. The authors also expect that the study will contrib-
ute to the discussions and debates toward identifying subject
elements for DL courses. The top subject areas (see Table 4)
based on their importance as reported by the participants of
the current study should be taken into consideration before
designing curricula for DLs and before developing a Europe-
wide unique LIS curriculum.
