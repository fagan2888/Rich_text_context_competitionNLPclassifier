This paper suggests a novel clustering method for analyzing the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data, which
include the determination of correlation of different crime types, the development of a likelihood index for crimes to occur in a
jurisdiction, and the clustering of jurisdictions based on crime type. The method was tested by using the 2005 assault data from
121 jurisdictions in Virginia as a test case. The analyses of these data show that some different crime types are correlated and some
different crime parameters are correlated with different crime types. The analyses also show that certain jurisdictions within Virginia
share certain crime patterns. This information assists with constructing a pattern for a specific crime type and can be used to
determine whether a jurisdiction may be more likely to see this type of crime occur in their area.
1. Introduction
The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is
a crime reporting program for local, state, and federal law
enforcement agencies that provides a wealth of incident level
data for use in analysis. It is part of the Uniform Crime
Reporting (UCR) Program which is administered by the FBI.
The UCR Program provides a nationwide view of crime based
on data submitted through state programs or directly to the
national UCR Program and has been operational for around
70 years. The NIBRS was implemented in the late 1970s to
meet law enforcement need for the 21st century. This vast
system houses information on offenses, victims, offenders,
property, and persons arrested, as well as the incident itself.
The data of NIBRS are well structured and readily available
for researchers and law enforcement agencies to assist with
understanding the intricate nature of crime.
Akiyama and Nolan [1] outlined the structure of the
NIBRS data set and provided methods for understanding
and analyzing the data. Dunn and Zelenock [2] also describe
and test procedures to facilitate the use of this vast system.
Building on these initial works, many authors continue
to investigate how this storehouse of data can be turned
into useful information for researchers and law enforcement
agencies. Much of the work employs descriptive statistics
applied in various sophisticated ways to extract information
from the files. For example, Thompson et al. [3] apply
descriptive statistics to examine intimate partner violence
and make connections between this crime and other crimes
that occurred in the same incident. They were able to show
a link between intimidation and more serious violent crimes
and extract information about the relationships between the
victim and the offender from the NIRBS data that helps
to better understand this type of crime. Snyder [4] used
logistic regression techniques to predict the arrest of juvenile
robbery offenders. More recently, Addington and Rennison
[5] used logistic regression models along with the NIBRS and
the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data for
predicting rape cooccurrence to provide a critical initial look
at rapes that occur with other crimes.
For criminologists the NIBRS data holds the answers
to many long-standing questions about crime, criminal
offending, and crime victimization. However, gaining access
to some of these answers has remained difficult because of

the size and complexity of the data. Effective techniques,
such as data mining and clustering, for criminal justice data
are of increasing importance to both the research and law
enforcement communities [6]. In recent years, clustering
categorical data has gained more importance because it is one
of the fundamental methods in data mining [7]. Clustering
crime data, as with other categorical data, is unsupervised
learning that aims at partitioning a data set into groups of
similar items. The goal is to create clusters of data objects
where the within-cluster similarity is maximized and the
between-cluster similarity is minimized. Over the years,
many clustering algorithms have been developed and tested.
Some clustering techniques have developed specifically for
use with categorical data. Abdu [8] presented three new
clustering algorithms that were applied to the clustering of the
NIBRS data. Two of his approaches combine spectral analysis
and clustering techniques that are scalable to large data sets
such as the NIBRS.
Clustering categorical data poses a challenge not encoun-
tered in clustering numerical data because the attribute
categories are not ordered and defining a metric with which
to measure the distance between data objects in a data
set becomes a challenge. Many of the algorithms that have
emerged for clustering categorical data rely on the occur-
rence/cooccurrence frequencies of attribute values in the
data set to determine clusters of similar data objects. The
basic goal is to choose a set of attribute categories that
provide a summary of the data objects in a cluster. There are
a wide range of clustering algorithms for categorical data,
including K-modes [9], STIRR [10], CACTUS [11], ROCK
[12], COOLCAT [13], LIMBO [14], and CLICKS [15]. A
good summary can be found in [8]. The clustering algorithm
used in this research is a mathematically well-defined model
implemented in a polynomial time algorithm that guarantees
an optimal solution [16].
Due to the lack of well-defined mathematical models
and optimization goals, most existing graph theory clustering
approaches could not guarantee a proper clustering result in
general cases. For example, agglomerative hierarchical clus-
tering methods could not produce proper clusters with larger
sizes, while divisive hierarchical methods could not produce
clusters with smaller sizes, and clusters with large difference
in their sizes and k-core method may produce clusters with
small edge-cuts, and so forth. Many papers and articles have
mentioned these problems and frustration among users (e.g.,
see [17­19]). Even the most popular commercial software,
SAS, is unable to produce proper outputs for some simple
data.
The purpose of this paper is to present a novel multidi-
mensional clustering method for the NIBRS data. We firstly
outlines a new measure, called the likelihood index, that helps
examine quantitatively how likely a crime is to occur in a
particular jurisdiction. This measure compares a vector that
describes a jurisdiction with a vector that represents a crime
type. Then according to the defined distance between these
two vectors, we can determine how closely the jurisdiction
aligns with that crime type. The data used in this study
were obtained from the 2005 NIBRS which is stored at the
National Archive for Criminal Justice Data at the University

of Michigan. This work explores the following research
questions. Do specific crimes exhibit certain quantifiable
characteristics? Do different types of crimes share similar
quantifiable characteristics? Do jurisdictions of a state cluster
with respect to different crime types? What is the likelihood
that if one type of crime is occurring in an area, other types of
crime with similar quantifiable characteristic will also occur
in that area?
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2
we summarize the data unit of analysis and preparation. In
Section 3 we introduce the methods to deal with the data
matrix and take Virginia as a case study. Section 4 provides
some additional results and Section 5 gives the conclusions
of the research.
2. Data Unit of Analysis and Preparation
The data sets available in the NIBRS provide a wealth
of incident level data about each reported crime. As for
2010, approximately 40 states contribute their data to the
massive data set. The data and tools are made available by
University of Michigan for use by law enforcement agencies
and researchers. In order to devise a manageable set of data
for preliminary testing of techniques and for preliminary data
analysis, only the 2005 data on assaults were explored. From
the 2005 assault data, 121 jurisdictions (counties or cities) in
The Scientific World Journal 3
Virginia were selected for examination. These represent all
jurisdictions within Virginia with populations greater than
10,000. There were 10,183 incidents reported in these 121
chosen jurisdictions.
For this study, 21 indexes from the NIBRS were chosen
from the 246 available indexes. These 21 indexes were deemed
important to provide the relevant characteristics of the vic-
tim(s), offender(s), and the circumstances of each incident.
The selected particular indexes were listed in Table 1.
In order to facilitate the selected analysis techniques, the
data was expanded from one column, with many possible
entries, to multi columns that contained zero or one. For
example, the Offender Segment index contains the sex of
the offender and has the possible entries of male, female, or
unknown. This index column was split into three individual
columns where an entry in the three columns of (1 0 0) means
female, (0 1 0) means male, and (0 0 1) means unknown. This
turns the column for sex of the offender to three columns. All
created columns were binary (0/1) columns that were used
to help classify the characteristics of the incident. From the
expansion of the original 21 indexes, 57 binary columns were
created. This led to the creation of a 121 × 57 Crime Data
Matrix, where each row  represents the th jurisdiction and
each column  represents the th parameter related to the
incident (e.g., offender sex, victim resident status) or a crime
type (e.g., hate crime, drug dealing). The Crime Data Matrix
construction is pictured below:

where ,
is the entry of the th crime index from the th
jurisdiction.
Normalization of the rows of the matrix was completed by
dividing each row entry by the population of the jurisdiction.
This gave a per person rate for each crime parameter or each
crime type. Normalization of the columns was completed
by averaging the columns and subtracting the average from
each entry in the column. Then each entry in the column
was divided by the vector length of the column. Equation (2)
shows these normalization step-by-step operations.

3. Finding Patterns in the Data
This section explains several different analyses that were
performed on the data in the matrix described above in order
to attempt to answer the research questions listed in Section 1.
These analyses include comparing the columns of the matrix
to determine the correlation of crime parameters to crime
types and to determine the correlation of different crime
types. Also there were two analyses performed comparing the
row vectors to develop the likelihood index and to cluster the
jurisdictions by crime types.
3.1. Correlation of Crime Parameters and Crime Types (Com-
paring the Column Vectors). The motivation for comparing
the different crime parameters to crime types is to determine
if there are some characteristics that can tell us about the
likelihood of a crime type to occur in a certain jurisdiction.
Each crime type may have factors that contribute to a specific
crime appearing in a certain place. An overall increase in
crime in an area may or may not correlate to an increase in
any one particular type of crime, say hate crime, in that area.
However, there may be individual parameters whose increase
may indicate an increase in a particular type of crime. For
example, if juvenile offenders are up in a certain area, this
may indicate that hate crimes will also be up in that area.
Also crime type vectors were compared against each other
in a similar way. For example, crimes like juvenile gang were
compared against hate crime to see if these crime types also
have a correlation.
In order to determine the relationship between the th
parameter (th column of the Crime Data Matrix) and any
other column (another parameter or another crime type), the
correlation coefficient (cosine of the angle between the two
column vectors over the norm of the vectors) was calculated.
Each of the columns of the crime data matrix forms a vector in
a 121-dimensional space and the vectors can be geometrically
compared, with the correlation between two parameters
represented by the cosine of the angle in this space. For
example, the column for the juvenile offender could be
compared against the column for hate crime or the column
for hate crime can be compared to the column for gang-
related crime. These comparisons are made by calculating the
angle between these two columns to determine if there is any
relationship and how strong that relationship may be. This
method can assist in determining whether two columns vary
directly, inversely, or separately.
For this comparison of two column vectors, the variation
in two vectors must be transformed to eliminate the effects
of mean differences. Once the mean deviation is determined,
then the correlation can be determined by the cosine of
the angle between the vectors. As an example, let  =
(1
, 2
, . . . , 121
) be the column for juvenile offender and let

) be the column for the hate crime
indicator. To find the correlation coefficient of this two
columns calculate the following:

= cos 
=










 
. (3)
The sign of the answer is ignored, since either a strong positive
relationship (close to 1 meaning that the two angles are in
the same direction and close to one another) or a strong
negative relationship (close to -1 meaning that the two angles
are in opposite directions, but nearly opposite one another)
indicates that the vectors appear to be related in some way.
In doing this comparison, with one vector fixed and
comparing it to all other vectors and itself, we form a
row vector of size 57. Consider the example that compares
the hate crime vector with all other vectors. We construct
another vector that we refer to as the Hate Crime Character
Vector of size 57, which contains all the cosine 
(the
correlation coefficient of the th parameter with respect to
hate crime). A new vector is formed from all these correlation
coefficients (1
, 2
, . . ., 57
), where each of the 57 parameters
has a correlation coefficient vector associated with it. Now
consider the corresponding components in the Hate Crime
Character Vector. Table 2 tells us how hate crimes are related
to aggravated assault crimes. Among those crimes, juvenile
gang (0.4058) has higher correlation with hate crime, while
the others, for example, argument (0.1325) and drug dealing
(0.0265) have relatively lower correlation.
Table 3 also shows similar evidence that for victim's age,
the age group less than 18 is also more correlated to hate crime
than the other two age groups. Many such comparisons can
be observed using these correlation coefficient vectors.
3.2. Analyses of Jurisdictions (Comparing the Row Vectors).
By using the correlation coefficients, a 57-dimensional vector,
two data analyses can be performed, each of which indicates
the likelihood of a particular crime for each jurisdiction.
The first one is a numerical index, called the likelihood index
assigned to each of the 112 jurisdictions. The second one is
a clustering analysis of all jurisdictions. Jurisdictions with
similar recorded crime patterns (adjusted corresponding to
correlation coefficients) form clusters.
Let  = {1
, 2
, . . . , 121
} be the likelihood index vector
where 
is the likelihood index between jurisdiction  and a
particular crime (e.g., hate crime) or crime parameter (e.g.,
juvenile offender). For this comparison of two row vectors,
the variation in two vectors must be transformed to eliminate
the effects of mean differences. Once the mean deviation is
determined, then the correlation can be determined by the
cosine of the angle between the vectors. As an example, let  =
(1
, 2
, . . . , 57
) be the row for the Norfolk jurisdiction and let
 = (1
, 2
, . . . , 57
) be the row for the hate crime indicator. To
find the correlation coefficient of these two rows calculate the
following:

= cos 
=

3.3. Using the Correlation Coefficients to Cluster the Jurisdic-
tions. To begin the clustering, a weighted complete graph
with 121 vertices is formed. The weight on each edge is the
correlation coefficient between the jurisdictions. The novel
graph theory clustering method we proposed in [20] is used
to find all the dense (highly weighted) subgraphs of the
complete graph. A distinguished feature of this method,
nonbinary hierarchical tree, clearly highlights meaningful
clusters which significantly reduces further manual efforts for
cluster selections. The results of clustering the jurisdictions
with respect to hate crimes are also displayed in Figure 1 and
Table 4.
It can be seen that of the top 30 jurisdictions with respect
to hate crimes, 12 of the top 15 are in Cluster A and the others
are in Cluster B. The remaining 91 jurisdictions also fall into
Cluster B. The 12 higher hate crime rate counties (cities) are
showed in Figure 1 (in red and blue).
4. Additional Results
Similar analyses where performed with respect to other crime
types: drug-dealing, juvenile gang, and gangland (organized
crime involvement). The results are summarized in Tables 5­
10.
Table 6 summarizes the drug dealing vector comparison
with the offender parameter vectors.
Tables 5 and 6 summarize the comparison of the drug
dealing vector with other crime parameter vectors. Each of
the other crime parameters related to the victim and the
offender was compared to the drug dealing vector. A high
value for this correlation coefficient implies that there is a
correlation between this crime parameter and drug dealing.
Again, the motivation for comparing the different crime
parameters to crime types is an attempt to determine if there

are some characteristics that can tell us about the likelihood
of a crime type to occur in a certain jurisdiction. For
example, the correlation between the drug dealing vector and
individual victim is 0.5789, which is much higher than the
correlation between drug dealing and victim type business
(0.1721) or victim type society/public (0.1729). This would
seem to imply that for jurisdictions where the individual vic-
tim crimes are evident they may also have the likelihood for
drug dealing related crimes. The tables show the correlation
coefficient values: the correlation values in bold show a higher
correlation with the drug dealing crime type than the other
parameters in that category.
Table 7 summarizes the drug dealing vector comparison
with the other crime types. The highest correlation is with

5. Conclusion
The NIBRS provides a wealth of incident level data for use
in analysis. The methods investigated in this research yielded
promising preliminary results. The methods were applied
only to the assault data from 2005 but can easily be extended
to other crime types and to other years to validate these results
and also provide longitudinal investigation.
The comparison between the crime type vector and the
individual parameters vectors helped in two cases (hate
crimes and drug dealing) to determine which factors was
more related to those crimes. The different types of analyses
that were conducted on the jurisdictions helped to validate
one another. The likelihood index looked at whether a certain
crime pattern existed in that jurisdiction, while the clustering

method sought to cluster all the jurisdictions based on the
crime patterns of that jurisdiction. This information could be
useful to assist law enforcement agencies or policy makers
in determining which jurisdictions share common challenges
that could possibly be addressed through cooperation and
sharing resources between jurisdictions.
The next steps would be to utilize this same approach for
data from other states or perhaps a larger region to examine
if the same information is observed from the analyses. It will
be interesting to see if Virginia data and other states have
the same patterns or if different patterns emerge. Further
research and refinement of these methods should yield tools
that would provide researchers, law enforcement agencies,
and government officials with a means to find patterns of
different crime types and possibly identify jurisdictions that
may be likely to experience that type of crime.
