Abstract
The relative contributions of fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) to body weight are key indicators for several major public health issues.
Predictive models could offer new insights into body composition analysis. A non-parametric equation derived from a probabilistic Baye-
sian network (BN) was established by including sex, age, body weight and height. We hypothesised that it would be possible to assess the
body composition of any subject from easily accessible covariables by selecting an adjusted FFM value within a reference dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) measurement database (1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), n 10 402). FM
was directly calculated as body weight minus FFM. A French DXA database (n 1140) was used (1) to adjust the model parameters
(n 380) and (2) to cross-validate the model responses (n 760). French subjects were significantly different from American NHANES subjects
with respect to age, weight and FM. Despite this different population context, BN prediction was highly reliable. Correlations between BN
predictions and DXA measurements were significant for FFM (R 2 0·94, P,0·001, standard error of prediction (SEP) 2·82 kg) and the per-
centage of FM (FM%) (R 2 0·81, P,0·001, SEP 3·73 %). Two previously published linear models were applied to the subjects of the French
database and compared with BN predictions. BN predictions were more accurate for both FFM and FM than those obtained from linear
models. In addition, BN prediction generated stochastic variability in the FM% expressed in terms of BMI. The use of such predictions
in large populations could be of interest for many public health issues.

Non-parametric models
The relative contribution of fat-free mass (FFM) and fat
mass (FM) to body weight is a relevant indicator for
major public health issues(1,2). Due to the accumulation
of excess fat tissue, the worldwide increase in the preva-
lence of obesity contributes to a high risk of metabolic
disorders such as CVD and type 2 diabetes(3). In addition,
FFM loss in ageing populations and its progression towards
sarcopenia increase morbidity and mortality(4 ­6). Accurate
measurements of body composition can be obtained from
reference methods, such as underwater weighing, dilution
techniques and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
Although the use of such methods is widespread, their
application is time consuming and expensive, and as a
result, they are not relevant for use as a part of routine
clinical examinations or population studies. Bioelectrical
impedance has often been considered to be a convenient
tool for body composition analysis. However, the recorded
bioelectrical values (resistance and reactance) must be
used in equations that are body shape specific, and accu-
rate FFM and FM assessments require adjustments with a
gold standard method(7 ­10).
In contrast, simple anthropological measurements, such
as body weight or BMI, cannot give a reliable quantifi-
cation of body composition, although they are of predic-
tive interest at a population level(3,11­ 13). Models that
provide reliable predictions of body composition from
very simple covariables are still needed. Because increa-
singly more information on body composition analysis is
available, either directly from large surveys (e.g. National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHANES) or
indirectly through scientific publications, we investigated
the potential of a non-parametric model derived from
a Bayesian network (BN) to predict body composition.
A BN provides a global joint probability distribution over
a set of random variables(14,15). The ability to combine vari-
ables and the growing capabilities of computer calculations
have made these models increasingly popular. Indeed,
they have become of great use in quantitative risk assess-
ment(15 ­17). However, to our knowledge, such models
have not been used for body composition analysis. Assu-
ming a direct influence of sex, age, body weight and height
on body composition(18­21), we hypothesised that it might

be possible to assess the body composition of any subject
by selecting an adjusted FFM value from a DXA measure-
ment database (DXA, 1999­2004 NHANES) with easily
accessible covariables (sex, age, height and weight). The
present study aims to present this new calculation concept
and to validate BN predictions for FFM and FM against
DXA measurements obtained from an independent
sample of French subjects. A comparison with previously
published linear models(11,22) was also performed.
Method
Reference database used for body composition analysis
All FFM values used for body composition predictions
were extracted from the NHANES website (http://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/) for the 1999­2004
period (n 10 402). Subjects were characterised from the
covariables (sex, age, height and weight) included in the
model irrespective of ethnicity (Table 1).
For the current purpose, only subjects having a valid
scan were included, and the mean value of five DXA
measurements (Hologic QDR-4500) was considered. Lean
mass values were increased by 5 % to overcome the initial
reduction imposed on the entire NHANES database, as
explained in the user guide (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes/dxx/dxa.htm)(23).
Independent body composition database for model fitting
and validation
A database of 1140 French subjects (aged between 20 and
79 years and with BMI between 18·5 and 40 kg/m2) who
had their body composition measured by DXA (Hologic
QDR-4500) during routine examination at the Radiology
Department of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital
Centre (CHU) between 1998 and 2008 was used. From
this database, two different subsets were defined to adjust
parameters for FFM estimates (CHU-fit: 380 subjects), and
the second was used to cross-validate model responses
(CHU-valid: 760 subjects) (Table 1). Subsets were matched
for sex and BMI distributions.
Fat-free mass adjustments
For each subject in the CHU-fit database, a subset of candi-
dates was selected in the NHANES database using a BN
equation, which included the age, body weight and
height of the subject to predict.
A distance was computed from the covariables using the
following formula:
D ¼
max wa
da
; wh
dh
; ww
dw
À Á
wa
þ wh
þ ww
;
where da
, dh
, dw
are the absolute values of the difference
for age, height and weight, respectively, between the
CHU subject to predict and the NHANES subjects of similar
sex, and wa
, wh
, ww
are associated weighting parameters
for age, height and weight, respectively. A maximal dis-
tance (Dm
) was defined as the maximal selection limit.
Only the NHANES subjects with D , Dm
were retained as
candidates for prediction. When the closest NHANES sub-
ject was at a distance greater than Dm
, the predictive
subset was empty, and no prediction was proposed.
For some combination of parameters (wa
, wh
, ww
, Dm
),
the coefficient of determination between FFM predictions
and the corresponding DXA measurements, the standard
error of prediction (SEP) and the prediction rate (ratio of
the predicted individuals to the total number of individuals
to predict) were simultaneously computed and used as
criteria to estimate the quality of adjustment. Weighting
parameters varying from 0·05 to 0·2 (age in years), 0·2 to
0·4 (height in cm) and 0·7 to 0·9 (weight in kg) were
tested, with Dm
varying from 0·005 to 0·015 (arbitrary
units). From a selected subset of candidates, the one
having the median FFM value was used for prediction,
and his/her FFM value was attributed to the CHU subject.
Prediction was supported by the subject having the

median FFM value of the subset of candidates instead of
using the mean FFM value, which did not correspond to
any particular subject. Increasing the number of candidates
within the predictive subset extended the calculation pro-
cess without producing a gain on the quality of prediction;
thus, when the number of candidates exceeded fifty, only
the fifty closest were kept. FM was then determined,
assuming FM ¼ body weight 2 FFM.
Extreme anthropometric situations were discarded, and
model predictions were limited to subjects with BMI
values between 18·5 and 40 kg/m2. In addition, model
predictions were limited to subjects above 20 years of
age to avoid growth influences on body composition
analysis and below 79 years of age due to the weak
representation of older subjects in the reference database.
These restrictions were applied to the French databases
(CHU-fit and CHU-valid) but not to the NHANES
database. A candidate could be selected outside these
limits when his/her covariables gave a distance below Dm
.
Comparisons with other predictive models
Predictions of the percentage of body fat (FM%) on CHU
subjects were compared when obtained with either BN
or multiple regression models. Two equations were con-
sidered as follows:
A predictive equation including sex and BMI(22)
FM% ¼ 4·35 £ BMI 2 ð0·05 £ BMI2Þ 2 46·24
ðif femaleÞ;
FM% ¼ 3·76 £ BMI 2 ð0·04 £ BMI2Þ 2 47·80

ðif femaleÞ;
FM% ¼ 55·4 2 943·8 £ 1=BMI þ 0·087 £ age
ðif maleÞ:
ð2Þ
This last formula was proposed with an ethnic correction
for Asian subjects, which was not used here. These
equations were developed to predict FM%. Using a two-
compartment model, they were applied to body weight
to deduce FM and, consequently, FFM.
Statistical computations and analyses. Underlying cal-
culations were processed using the Rebastaba package(24)
written in R (R Development Core Team, 2009), a language
and environment for statistical computing (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; ISBN 3-900051-
07-0, URL http://www.R-project.org), which is available
at http:/r-forge.r-project.org/projects/riskassessments/
The quality of prediction was globally assessed on both
CHU-fit and CHU-valid databases by the SEP, which is
defined as follows:

Results
Model parameter adjustments
The NHANES and CHU (fit and valid) subjects were signifi-
cantly different for all variables (P,0·001) with the excep-
tion of height (except for CHU-valid, where women were
taller than those in the other groups). The NHANES sub-
jects had greater body weight, BMI and FM than the
French subjects. The CHU subjects had a slightly but sig-
nificantly higher FFM (not significant for CHU-fit women)
than the NHANES subjects. CHU-valid women had higher
FFM values than the other female groups (Table 1). There-
fore, BN prediction was analysed for subjects very distinct
from the NHANES population.
Numerous combinations of weighting coefficients and
Dm
were first considered. Among them, 125 effective com-
binations were scrutinised for the SEP and rate of predic-
tion for the subjects belonging to the CHU-fit database.
As expected, there were interactions between the SEP
and the rate of prediction. The SEP decreased with Dm
until a minimum corresponding to the optimal fit between
FFM predictions and DXA measurements, and then
increased again with larger Dm
values (Fig. 1(a)). Decrea-
sing Dm
led to an increase in the number of empty predic-
tive subsets and consequently worsened the prediction
rate. Reaching a predictive rate of 100 % was possible but
reduced the quality of fit (SEP approximately 3 kg;
Fig. 1(b)). The retained combination provided a compro-
mise between the two criteria, with an SEP of 2·84 kg
and a prediction rate of 99·21 %. The corresponding
weighting parameters were as follows:
wa
¼ 0·08; wh
¼ 0·2; ww
¼ 0·5;
with Dm
set at 0·0075.
Using these weighting parameters, the correlation
between FFM predicted by the BN equation and FFM
measured by DXA for the CHU-fit subjects was highly
significant (R 2 0·94, P,0·001). This combination of
parameters was used in all subsequent calculations.
Accuracy of model prediction
The BN equation was cross-validated on the CHU-valid
subjects. The subjects' repartition was fairly balanced

between the CHU-fit and CHU-valid groups. No difference
was observed for variables from men from the two data-
bases. However, CHU-valid women were slightly taller
and had higher FFM values than CHU-fit women. The cov-
ariables (age, height and weight) of the NHANES subjects
selected as predictors were similar to those of the CHU
subjects, and no difference was observed between the
groups (Table 2).
The FFM, FM and FM% values of the predictors were
plotted against their respective experimental DXA counter-
parts (Fig. 2). Accuracy of BN prediction was compared
with the two linear models, equations 1 and 2. The quality
of fit was excellent in women for FFM (SEP 2·71 kg, R 2
0·86) and was superior to those obtained with equation 1
(SEP 3·64 kg, R 2 0·82) or equation 2 (SEP 3·73 kg,
R 2 0·83). Similar trends were found for males; however,
discrepancies between the three models were less pro-
nounced for males than for females. All correlations were
highly significant (Table 3). Because FM was deduced
from FFM, the SEP was equivalent for FFM and FM.
Correlations were still highly significant for FM%, although
predictions were less closely fit to their experimental
counterparts, and the SEP remained lower for BN predic-
tion than those obtained with linear models.
When FM% was expressed in terms of BMI, a large inter-
individual variability was observed with experimental
measurements for both males and females. This variability
was better described by the BN predictions than with other
models (Fig. 3). The variability observed with equation 2
was introduced by the age effect, which was not sufficient
by itself to describe the inter-individual variability. In con-
trast, the well-known sex difference in FM% in terms of
BMI was well described by the three predictive models.
Discussion
The main objective of the present study was to investigate
the potential use of a non-parametric equation derived
from a BN to assess body composition with easily accessible
covariables. BN are particularly useful in predicting events
in a population when only part of the information is avail-
able or eventually provided as aggregated information.
However, in the present study, BN prediction was validated
in a context where all the covariables needed for prediction
were known. It was shown that the BN enabled the precise
prediction of the FFM of the French subjects (CHU) from
body composition values recorded in the US population
(NHANES). The first requirement in developing such a
model was to have a validated database of body compo-
sition measurements. DXA is one of the gold standard
methods for assessing body composition(25). The NHANES
database, to our knowledge, is the largest database of
DXA body composition measurements available for down-
loading. It offers a good reliability, with five replicates per
subject recorded under validated procedures. The second
requirement was to have a database of body composition

analysis for a population similar to the population of inter-
est. We were particularly interested in describing a French
European population. Therefore, we used a French dataset
to adjust the parameters of the BN equation. However, the
equation could have been adjusted or applied to any
other population. It is interesting to note that the NHANES
database could be used to describe the body composition
of a population of interest that differed in many aspects
(age, weight and BMI). To predict the body composition
of a subject, the BN equation returned an adjusted subset
of candidates from which the one having the median FFM
value was the predictor. His/her FFM value was attributed
to the subject to predict, and FM was directly deduced as
the body weight minus FFM. It would have been possible
to do similar adjustments from any body compartment
(fat, lean or bone mass). However, FFM was the most
important body compartment, and the one most closely
adjusted to the BN covariables(18­20). FM was then con-
sidered to be the adjusting variable. Bone mineral content
represents the smallest compartment (about 3·5 % of
weight). It was not considered to be a specific compartment
but was included in FFM.
The potential outcomes associated with a reliable predic-
tive model for body composition have been highlighted(1),
and many attempts to describe body composition, particu-
larly body fat, using linear models with simple variables
have been proposed. They usually included BMI, and
occasionally, age or ethnicity(20,25,26). It was thus interes-
ting to compare the fit obtained with BN prediction and
with linear predictive models when applied to the same
population. Two robust and clearly described equations
were used for comparison. Equation 1(22) included a quad-
ratic form of BMI that was irrespective of age, while
equation 2(11) included BMI, age and ethnicity, both with
sex specificities. When applied to the CHU-valid subjects,
the quality of FM% adjustments was very similar to those
obtained in the original population context(11,22). For
equation 2, the quality of fit varied from R 2 0·81, with
SEP 4·31 %, in the original population to R 2 0·81, with
SEP 4·01 %, for the CHU-valid subjects. For equation 1,
when stratified by sex, the quality of fit varied from
R 2 0·78, with SEP 4·63 %, in the original population to
R 2 0·67, with SEP 4·73 %, for CHU-valid females and
from R 2 0·68, with SEP 4·90 %, to R 2 0·59, with SEP 4·12 %,
for CHU-valid males. The similarity of fit obtained with
these two models in different populations confirms their
robustness. For both body compartments (FFM and FM),
BN prediction resulted in a better fit than linear models,
especially for FFM, which was the adjusted compartment.
It is noteworthy that BN prediction was obtained without
considering ethnicity. At first, ethnicity was included
as a putative variable in the network due to its possible

impact on FFM(27,28) and on fat deposition(29,30). In calcu-
lations not shown here, the quality of fit was analysed
using either white, non-Hispanic subjects alone (as defined
in the NHANES database) or all subjects, irrespective of
ethnicity. Although the French population to predict
(CHU) was mostly Caucasian, the best fit was obtained
when the entire database was used (SEP 2·84 kg) rather
than limited to white, non-Hispanic subjects (SEP
3·11 kg). The influence of ethnicity was, therefore, not
included in the final model adjustment.
Sex differences observed in the relationships between
BMI and FM% were similar to those previously
described(21,31). In contrast to other predictive linear
models, BN prediction provided a stochastic picture of
inter-individual variability, as illustrated by the relationship
between BMI and FM% and could be useful to depict bio-
logical variability in any population of interest.
The BN equation is not a ready-to-use tool for straight
application; instead, it should be considered as a new
concept in the field of body composition assessments
that can be improved in further releases. The applicability
and accuracy of model predictions directly depend on the
quality and quantity of the available information in the
NHANES database. The predictive subset size varied from
zero to fifty subjects. An empty subset meant that it was
not possible to find a candidate in NHANES having the
requested age, height and weight within the constraints
imposed by the BN equation This prediction failure was
rather low, and only four subjects out of 760 were not pre-
dicted. When the subset size equalled one, the FFM predic-
tion was deduced from a single candidate with a higher
risk of poor adjustment. These types of situations were
more frequently found for extreme anthropometric
values. Of the five predicted subjects with a subset of
one (all female), two were taller than 180 cm, and two
were shorter than 148 cm. Excluding subjects predicted
from only one candidate, the quality of fit was slightly
better for FFM (SEP 2·76 kg instead of 2·84 kg) but with a
decreased rate of prediction (from 99·2 to 98·54 %). In con-
trast, a NHANES subject can be selected as a predictor for
different CHU-valid subjects (six NHANES subjects were
selected three times; sixty-seven were selected twice and
604 were involved in a single prediction). The number of
replicates of a predictor depended on the covariable distri-
bution of the population to predict. Retaining different
model limits to avoid rare anthropometric situations
could be a possible way to improve the model.
The quality of FFM predictions obtained with the BN
model were similar to those obtained with bioelectrical
impedance equations, where SEP varied from 2 to 3·6kg(32),

suggesting that BN predictions could offer an interesting
alternative to bioelectrical impedance measurements,
usually considered as a convenient field measurement(8).
An additional interesting aspect of such a model derived
from BN is the possibility of adding/removing variables.
Waist circumference has a significant relationship with
body fat(31,33). Thus, it might be worth considering its
inclusion to improve the BN prediction of body composition.
