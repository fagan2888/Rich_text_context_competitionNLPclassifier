Introduction
Research into the education of physical education (PE)
teachers has been a growing field of interest over the last
couple of decades. Practicum--that is, the periods of school
placement that student teachers have in the course of their
education--is considered an essential aspect of physical edu-
cation teacher education (PETE) (Chambers & Armour,
2012; Larsson, 2009; Mordal-Moen & Green, 2012; Velija,
Capel, Katene, & Hayes, 2008; Wang & Ha, 2012). In an
ideal setting, student teachers are supported during the pract-
icum by both teacher educators and cooperating teachers.
These three groups are referred to as the practicum triad
(e.g., Belton, Woods, Dunning, & Meegan, 2010).
Although practicum in PETE has been an object for inves-
tigations, this line of research has mainly focused on the stu-
dent teachers' points of view (e.g., Booth, 1993; Dunning,
Meegan, Woods, & Belton, 2011; Jenkins, Garn, & Jenkins,
2005; Lamb, Lane, & Aldous, 2013; Moen & Standal, 2014;
Ovens, 2004; Standal, Moen, & Moe, 2014; Stidder, 2012;
Stidder & Hayes, 2006; Tinning, Jenkins, Collins, Rossi, &
Brancato, 2012). These investigations have established that
student teachers value the practicum aspect of their education
considerably higher than the university-based aspect of their
teacher education programs. In fact, it is reported that student
teachers claim to have difficulty seeing the relationship
between these two contexts (Larsson, 2009; Mordal-Moen &
Green, 2012; Velija et al., 2008). One reason suggested for
this situation is that student teachers find it difficult to make
meaningful connections between the theoretical coursework
and its practical application in the teaching of PE during
practicum (Bulger et al., 2001; Larsson, 2009).
In two recent articles, Standal et al. (2014) and Moen and
Standal (2014) have explored what and how student teachers
learn during the PETE practicum. Similar to earlier findings,
Moen and Standal (2014) found that the students were not
inclined to reflect on the practicum experiences with a
socially critical perspective, but it was also found that the
students were inclined to think critically about their own
teaching performance as well as on the cooperating teachers'
way of teaching. That is, contrary to earlier research (e.g.,
Dowling, 2011; Moen, 2011; Mordal-Moen & Green, 2012;
Velija et al., 2008), the practicum was not found to be a site
where student teachers uncritically digest everything they
are told or shown.
Compared with research on the student teachers, the per-
spectives of teacher educators and cooperating teachers have
received lesser attention in the literature. Although teacher
educators appear highly appreciative of the significance of
the practicum element of PETE, studies reveal that they play
a very distant role during the practicum period (Larsson,
2009; Moen, 2011; Mordal-Moen & Green, 2012; Velija

Practicum in Physical Education Teacher
Education: An Educational Partnership?
Kjersti Mordal Moen1 and Øyvind Standal1,2
Abstract
The national curricula for physical education teacher education (PETE) in Norway require that practicum is carried out in a
partnership between student teachers, cooperating teachers, and teacher educators. The aim of this article is to get insights
into how cooperating teachers and teacher educators express and understand their educational partnership and mutual
contribution to the practicum in PETE. Focus group interviews with cooperating teachers and physical education teacher
educators (teacher educators) were analyzed by drawing on sensitizing concepts from figurational sociology. As such, the
study has intended to identify networks between the two groups, as well as the interdependent nature, and consequent
power relations in the partnership. The research may shed light on understanding why it seems difficult to reach the aim in
the national curriculum of a mutual partnership of the two groups in practicum.
Keywords
physical education teacher education, practicum, cooperating, teachers, teacher educators, Norway
2 SAGE Open
et al., 2008). In the Norwegian context, teacher educators are
involved in the practicum in the role as a "contact teacher,"
which means that they visit schools when student teachers do
their practicum (Moen, 2011). However, Moen (2011) found
that the teacher educators question the suitability and viabil-
ity of the role as contact teacher. For example, some view
practicum visits as a needless use of time because they
already know the cooperating teacher and, by implication,
know what and how the mentors will perform their roles.
Regarding the cooperating teachers, research has indi-
cated that--much like student teachers--cooperating teach-
ers express a need for the students to spend more time in
teaching practice to adequately prepare them for their future
role as PE teachers (Hynes-Dusel, 1999). It has also been
shown that the mentoring process is hierarchical in the sense
that the mentors played the dominant role and the student
teachers were subservient (Wang & Ha, 2012). Thus, power
is an aspect of the mentoring process, and a topic we will
return to later. Other studies report that the student teachers'
pre-conceived beliefs about what constitutes a qualified PE
teacher are not challenged by cooperating teachers during
the practicum (Dowling, 2011; Larsson, 2009; Mordal-
Moen & Green, 2012, 2014; Velija et al., 2008). For instance,
as Velija and co-workers argue that if students are not ade-
quately supported to make the connections between theory
and practice, student teachers may end up accepting "the
ideologies of those whose knowledge they value and which
will help them get by school-based mentors" (Velija et al.,
2008, pp. 403-404).
Based on the reviewed literature, it appears that teacher
educators have a distant role in the practicum. This is also
underscored through research findings indicating that it is
the knowledge preferences of cooperating teachers, such as
the procedural, knowledge-in-practice (Hegender, 2010),
which dominates the mentoring process in practicum. Thus,
questions can be raised about the nature and extent of the
cooperation between the three parts of the practicum triad.
As a consequence, there have been calls for improved coop-
eration between the parties to ensure the students' learning
outcomes (e.g., Moen & Standal, 2014). Chambers and
Armour (2011) argue that "in order to support PETE student
learning more effectively in Ireland, school and university
personnel must work in an effective partnership to educate
PETE students" (p. 541). To meet this challenge, an Irish
research team has investigated the impact of a program
designed to enhance the cooperation by supporting the
members of the practicum triad. In three articles, presenting
the perspectives of the student teachers, teacher educators,
and cooperating teachers, respectively, the program was
found to support the cooperating teachers in defining their
role (Belton et al., 2010). It also provided a framework to
support the role of university supervisor (teacher educator;
Meegan, Dunning, Belton, & Woods, 2013), and it led to
better learning experiences for the student teachers (Dunning
et al., 2011).
The purpose of the present study was to explore the per-
ceptions and viewpoints of teacher educators and cooperat-
ing teachers on the practicum aspect of PETE in Norway. As
such, our study can be seen as an attempt to cross-validate
the findings from the Irish research just presented. In addi-
tion, research on the practicum in PETE has been compart-
mentalized, dealing with the different groups of the practicum
triad in relative isolation. To the best of our knowledge, no
research has been reported that has examined the perspec-
tives of both teacher educators and cooperating teachers in
the same study.
Research Question and Perspective
It is well known that there exists a theory­practice fragmen-
tation in PETE (e.g., Hegender, 2010; Moen & Standal,
2014), where the practical aspects of teaching performances,
such as planning and delivering lessons or class manage-
ment, are highly valued whereas the more theoretical aspects
of PETE are given less value. Spendlove, Howes, and Wake
(2010) suggest that the different roles of school and univer-
sity "represent a division of labour, which can be character-
ised as theory on the one hand, and practice on the other"
(p. 66). More precisely, they describe theory and practice as
belonging to separate worlds. Given that the official PETE
curriculum in Norway (Utdannings- og forskningsdeparte-
mentet [UFD], 2003a, 2003b, 2010) stipulates that the practi-
cum is intended to be carried out in a partnership between
student teachers, cooperating teachers, and teacher educa-
tors, our research interest has been in the relationship
between the cooperating teachers and teacher educators. Our
interest--as researchers and teacher educators--has been in
how teacher educators and cooperating teacher best can
enable the student teachers to learn from the relationship
between practicum and the other parts of the educational pro-
gram. More specifically, we have been interested in how
teacher educators and cooperating teachers see themselves as
participants in a network (or not). Therefore, our research
question has been how do cooperating teachers and teacher
educators express their educational partnership and (poten-
tial) mutual contribution to the practicum of PETE in rela-
tion to the networks, interdependencies and power relations
they are a part of?
For the purpose of this study, we have drawn on resources
from figurational sociology (Elias, 1978; van Krieken, 1998).
Figurational theory emphasizes the need to locate people, in
this case, teacher educators and cooperating teachers, as
parts of various networks or figurations. Figurations are the
networks or "webs" of social relations (Elias, 1978) of which
people are inevitably a part. In other words, people are
related to a large number of other individuals, groups and
processes, past and present, which may be recognized or
unrecognized and which amount to "a structure of mutually
oriented and inter-dependent people" (Elias, 1978, p. 261).
At the local level, teacher educators as well as cooperating
Moen and Standal 3
teachers are likely to have complex professional figurations,
and they are involved in a web of relationships, which will
influence their professional life and development. In the con-
text of PETE, this web of relationships is a process that has
been formed from early childhood and school experience
(acculturation), in sport training, during education (profes-
sional socialization), and on-the-job experiences (occupa-
tional socialization; Moen, 2011). As such, the webs of
relationships have formed a framework not only for the per-
son's habitus but also for their socialization.
To discuss the research question and empirical material
generated for this article, we have found sensitizing concepts
from figurational theory; networks, interdependencies and
power relations (Elias, 1978) to be relevant. In addition, the
more mainstream sociological term roles served as a sensi-
tizing (Roberts, 2009). Although figurational theory has
become increasingly commonplace in the sociology of sports
over the last quarter of a century, it was only applied to PE
research a decade or so ago (Green, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003;
Green, Smith, & Roberts, 2005). Nonetheless, there has been
a steady subsequent growth of figurational studies on PE
teachers (Keay, 2006) as well as on PETE (Moen, 2011;
Velija et al., 2008). The sensitizing concepts applied on this
particular study will be elaborated in the discussion.
PETE in Norway
In the academic year 2011/2012 when this study was under-
taken, there were three different educational routes to become
a PE teacher in Norway. The first was to acquire 30 or 60
credits PE as a part of general teacher education (GTE). The
route enables the graduates to teach PE in primary and ele-
mentary school (ages 6 to 16). Another route was to take a
bachelor's degree in PE and sports (BAPE), a 3-year course
of stud PE full-time in which students acquired the title sub-
ject teacher in PE. The route enables the graduates to teach
PE in primary, elementary, and upper secondary schools as
well as at the "folkehøgskole."1 The third route to graduating
as a PE teacher was to take a bachelor's degree in, for exam-
ple, sports sciences, outdoor studies, or fitness and then com-
plete a further 1-year (60 credits) Practical and Didactical
Education (PDE) qualification, which qualifies the students
as subject teachers in PE. The students are qualified to teach
in primary, elementary, and upper secondary schools, but not
at the folk high school.
All three routes into PE teaching are based on the national
curriculum for teacher education (UFD, 2003a, 2003b,
2010). The practicum period accounts for approximately 12
to 14 weeks of the 3-year BAPE program, 100 days of the
4-year GTE program, and 12 to 14 weeks of the 1-year PDE
program.
The national curriculum for GTE (UFD, 2010) states that
there is a common responsibility between the cooperating
teacher and the teacher educators regarding practicum and
assessment of the student teachers in the practicum. In terms
of the various roles of those involved in the practicum, it is a
requirement that the institutions develop a plan for the practi-
cum in cooperation with the practicum school. The responsi-
bilities of the university teacher, the cooperating teacher, and
the students have to be clarified in the local curricula, which
each institution has to develop based on the national
curricula.
Method
The findings presented in this article are part of a larger study
that investigates the practicum aspect of PETE at three insti-
tutions in Norway. More specifically, the overall study has
investigated the perceptions, experiences, and viewpoints of
teacher educators, cooperating teachers, and student teach-
ers, respectively. Whereas our two previous publications
(Mordal-Moen & Green, 2014; Standal et al., 2014) have
explored the student teachers' perspective, this article
explores how cooperating teachers and teacher educators
understand or express their educational partnership (mutual
contribution) in PETE.
Participants
Three different university colleges (UC; called UC 1, 2, and
3 for anonymity) were enrolled in the umbrella study, which
consisted of focus group interviews of student teachers,
cooperating teachers, and teacher educators in each of the
three UCs participating in the study. The institutions invited
to participate in the study were chosen on the basis of (a)
providing at least two of the three routes to become a PE
teacher in the academic year 2011-2012, (b) the size of the
UC including both small and large university collages, and
(c) geographic location so as to include UCs located in both
urban and rural settings. Two of the UCs were located in
more rural areas of Norway whereas the third was situated in
a large city. The size of three UCs varied considerably; how-
ever, the size of the PE teacher educations programs was
somewhat similar. The rationale for this sample was to cover
the complexity in the Norwegian higher education system in
PETE.
Here, we draw on two focus group interviews of cooperat-
ing teachers and three focus interviews of teacher educators.
The cooperating teachers at the two UCs were all informed
about the study by our contact person at the UC, and invited
to take part in the study. From those who volunteered to par-
ticipate, we randomly drew a selection of eight participants
at each institution, four from each gender. Of the 16 cooper-
ating teachers asked to take part in the interviews, 12 (seven
women and five male) actually took part in the study (see
Table 1).
The head of department at the three different UCs were
contacted by the first author. Subsequently, the head of depart-
ment gave information about the study to the teacher educa-
tors and invited them to participate in the study. Among those
4 SAGE Open
who volunteered to take part in the study, we made a random
selection of eight participants from each institution, who were
asked to attend the group interview. Of the 24 teacher educa-
tors asked to participate in the interviews, 18 (seven women
and 11 male) took part in the study (see Table 1).
The group sizes of the focus group interviews with both
cooperating teachers and the teacher educators varied from
five to seven participants (see Table 1). This is fewer than we
had intended, but the numbers are still within the group size
recommended for focus group interviews (Malterud, 2012).
Although we were able to facilitate focus group inter-
views of teacher educators from all three UCs, it was diffi-
cult to get hold of cooperating teachers to attend the focus
group interviews. We experienced difficulty for the cooperat-
ing teachers to find time to meet for group interviews, not
least because of the long distances from their schools to the
UC (some had to travel more than 1 hr to attend), as well as
busy timetables in their everyday lives as teachers.
Consequently, we only managed to complete focus group
interviews of cooperating teachers at two of the UCs.
Interview Procedure
The focus group interviews with the teacher educators and
the cooperating teachers were semi-structured. Two key
themes (and related questions) formed the basis of inter-
views: (a) the teacher educators' and the cooperating teach-
ers' ideas about and perceptions of PE and PETE and (b)
their viewpoints and experiences regarding the practicum in
PETE. These themes are grounded in the research questions
of the study and our knowledge of the research literature on
the topic. One researcher conducted all five interviews. The
interviews took place in quiet meeting rooms and were
audiotaped with the teacher educators' and cooperating
teachers' oral consent. All three interviews with the teacher
educators lasted 1 hr and 30 min, whereas the two interviews
with the cooperating teachers lasted 1 hr and 10 min. Before
starting the interview, the interviewer gave a brief, standard-
ized explanation of the nature of the research. Furthermore,
all participants signed a consent form where they agreed that
the information supplied could be used in publications by the
research group if anonymized. This is in accordance with the
ethical guidelines of the Norwegian Social Sciences Data
Service who had previously endorsed the project.
Data Analysis
The interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to
an explorative thematic analysis (Kvale & Brinkman, 2009).
The analyses were performed jointly by the two authors and
took place in steps where we independently read the tran-
scripts and met on several occasions to discuss re-current
themes in the interviews. In the first stage, we independently
read the transcripts with the aim of doing a meaning conden-
sation (Kvale & Brinkman, 2009). This meant that relevant
quotes from the interviews were highlighted and the immedi-
ate meaning in them expressed in shorter sentences. The
research questions for the project as well as the main themes
in the interview guide were guiding this first and initial step
in our analysis. On the basis of our separate meaning conden-
sation, we agreed on five main focused codes supporting the
next step in the analyzing process: "just visiting," "the differ-
ent roles," "competence," "cooperation and control," and
"problems and conflicts."
In the next step of the analysis, all interviews were re-read
by the researchers independently having these five focused
codes and the sensitizing concepts roles, networks, interde-
pendencies, and power relations as a background, before we
met again to discuss the analyses. Thus, at this stage, the ana-
lytical story moved in a theoretical direction. As a result of
this process, we decided on two main themes, "just visiting"
and "cooperation--polarization," as relevant to present our
findings. In the final part of the analysis, we discussed what
quotations could best guide the story revealed from the
analyses.
Trustworthiness
To ensure the trustworthiness, our use of investigator
triangulation (Brantlinger, Jimenez, Klinger, Pugach, &
Richardson, 2005), as described in the "Analysis" section of
this article, strengthens the credibility of the study. The pres-
ent article is part of a larger research project involving other
researchers. We discussed the conceptualization of the study
as well as the analyses and results with other members of the
research team as well as colleagues who work in PETE. This
has functioned as a form of peer debriefing (Brantlinger
et al., 2005). During the analyses, we were all the time look-
ing for disconfirming evidence (Brantlinger et al., 2005) in
all stages of the analyzing process, for example, by trying to
find statements that contradicted or nuanced the emerging
codes and categories. However, observational studies on the
practicum visits would have improved our study, and we sug-
gest future studies to implement observational elements.
Multiple interviews of the subjects could also have increased
the trustworthiness of the study. However, we opted for inter-
viewing several groups of teacher educators and cooperating

Findings
Just Visiting?
One way of facilitating the cooperation between cooperating
teachers and teacher educators is to organize meetings such
as practicum preparation where cooperating teachers gather
at the UC prior to practicum. Another meeting point was
commonly referred to as "practicum visits," where teacher
educators went to practicum schools to observe students
holding lessons as well as take part in evaluations of these
lessons. The purpose of the latter visits was described as to
"see that it actually works and that the cooperating teacher
takes the students seriously and does what we expect them to
do" (Teacher educator [TE]-UC3).
The focus of the teacher educators during these visits is not
so much on the individual lesson, as to get an overall impres-
sion about how things work for the students and to see how the
cooperating teachers follow up the students: "I often think that
the supervision sessions are more interesting than the lessons,
because there I get the impression of how things are going"
(TE-UC3) or "When we visit practicum we are more interested
in what they have worked with in the entire period, not neces-
sarily what went on in the specific lesson we got to see. More
how the students have developed through period" (TE-UC1).
"Visiting" can be thought of as an expression that does not
have any meaning beyond it being an innocent notion used
by all groups about the teacher educators' appearance at the
practicum site. However, the word visit also contains impli-
cations about the interdependency between cooperating
teachers and teacher educators. For instance, our analysis
clearly shows that the teacher educators are much more con-
cerned about these visits than the cooperating teachers. This
is evident in the sense that discussions about the visits were
more prevalent in the interviews with teacher educators.
When cooperating teachers talked about visits, it was in rela-
tion to rare cases where students were seen as unfit as teach-
ers, and they had to report this to the teacher educators.
For the teacher educators, these visits had a different
meaning. The visits meant that they had to leave their home
institution and travel to the practicum site. It involved more
of an effort for the teacher educators as compared with the
cooperating teachers. More importantly, however, we find
that the teacher educators'experience being away from home
in the sense that they have to behave as visitors. This becomes
particularly salient when difficulties arise:
The moment I visit their home court--I am visiting!--then I
don't want to step on their toes. I feel in a way that I come from
the university college and--Mrs. know-it-all! . . . I can ask
questions, but in a way I have to laugh at the same time. I don't
want to provoke them. (TE-UC1)
The teacher educator has a distinct sense of not wanting to
offend the hosts that she visits and that she is afraid to use her
competence both because she does not want to be perceived
as someone who knows better and because she does not want
to insult the cooperating teacher(s) she visits. This was found
in all the interviews with teacher educators: "I have some-
times wondered about issues that have come up, but I haven't
confronted it in the situation" (TE-UC2). Their strategy is
rather to discuss it with colleagues when they come back to
the UC and possibly say that this or that cooperating teacher
is not suitable for the job: "If it is a serious problem, then we
raise it internally [at the UC] and we don't request [that
teacher] next year" (TE-UC2)
Cooperation or Polarization?
The national curricula describe an ideal practicum as a joint
enterprise carried out in cooperation between teacher educa-
tors and cooperating teacher (UFD, 2003a, 2003b, 2010).
Previous research, however, has portrayed what goes on at
the university and in practicum as two separate worlds
(Larsson, 2009; Mordal-Moen & Green, 2012). This has
been framed in terms of a theory­practice distinction. This
was to some extent also the case in our material: "Lots of
theory is relevant, but the paradox is that we still have the
separation. For many it is only logical that theory is here [at
the university college] and practicum out there in the school"
(Cooperating teacher [CT]-UC2). In addition, one cooperat-
ing teacher stated that
I would have liked them [the students] to visit us prior to the
practicum. Now, they just jump right in and it is quite hectic.
They could have been prepared by seeing what we do and we
could have discussed and shown them different stuff . . . Because
it is like theory and practice. Some of those who teach here [at
the university college] have hardly been working in the schools.
It is lots of theory. The everyday is very different. (CT-UC1)
The last quote illustrates not only the view taken by many
cooperating teachers that the students should have been
obliged to visit them prior to their practicum, it also
expresses a commonly held skepticism among cooperating
teachers toward the degree to which teacher educators have
much practical experiences with teaching PE. It is clear
from the material we have analyzed that from the cooperat-
ing teachers' perspective, an essential purpose of the practi-
cum is to experience and see what it is like to really be a
teacher. As such, cooperating teachers manage a very impor-
tant knowledge resource for the students' learning. It is also
important to note that this view is held not only by cooperat-
ing teachers, but also by teacher educators: "[The purpose of
practicum] is to practice the role as a teacher with every-
thing that goes with it . . . You have to be in a school to
practice the role as teacher" (TE-UC2), or as another teacher
educator put it,
6 SAGE Open
For me, the cooperating teachers are not colleagues, but
important informants. Because it is many years since I worked
as a PE teacher . . . I learn a lot from the cooperating teachers
either from practical tips or whatever, really. (TE-UC1)
In line with the view expressed in the last quote, that par-
ticular teacher educator was quite critical toward the aca-
demization of PETE:
In the pursuit of doctoral degrees and professors, we have
missed out on that close contact with the field of practice and
with the cooperating teachers. We had one guy working here,
whose contract wasn't extended because he didn't have [a PhD],
but he was working well with the cooperating teachers and was
writing popularized texts about practical activities . . . And that
was shame because it was really a man who was focusing on all
this and really had something we needed. But most [teacher
educators] are concerned with teaching other subject areas or
qualifying for a higher academic level. I think it is a loss.
(TE-UC1)
Thus, an opposition toward theory and an academic per-
spective on PE(TE) is not only found among cooperating
teachers, but also among the ranks of teacher educators.
Although some cooperating teachers emphasize the useful-
ness of theoretical perspectives--"one should approach the
practical everyday work with theory . . . so a combination of
both theory and practice belongs [to practicum]" (CT-UC3),
teacher educators at all institutions expressed a view that the
cooperating teachers to a larger extent should provide stu-
dents with a meta-perspective on teaching PE:
How can you [i.e., the student] develop as a PE teacher in terms
of who you are in a given school context. . . . Being able to see
beyond one's daily work as a cooperating teacher seems to be
challenging. (TE-UC1)
Or as another said,
The cooperating teachers should familiarize themselves with
what the students work with theoretically, what they should
know and what should be expected from the student. That it is
not only "you did this and that well," but also reflect "why did
you this or that," That is, make them reflect instead of always
giving them the answer. (TE-UC2)
In opposition to the quote above where one teacher educa-
tor stated that cooperating teachers are informants and not
colleagues, the notion of a collegial relationship between the
two groups was expressed by other teacher educators as well
as by cooperating teachers. Some of the teacher educators
have backgrounds as PE teachers as well as cooperating
teachers, "so I definitely feel like a colleague" (TE-UC3).
Others again express this collegial relationship as grounded
in their common efforts to educate future PE teachers.
However, there are different understandings as to how the
partnership is implemented and realized. One teacher educa-
tor said,
Before practicum we have a discussion between [us] and
cooperating teachers and students. The cooperating teachers
always ask "what are we going to focus on in this period. What is
the order?" The experience is that when they get guidelines . . .
they are quite open to try them out. If we have wishes, then they
take care of them quite well. That's at least what I feel. (TE-UC1)
The intention to pull in the similar direction was also found
among cooperating teachers: "so I have to read their curri-
cula and their plans for what we should focus on" (CT-UC2).
However, it was also expressed in the interviews that the
teacher educators give the cooperating teachers rather free
reins: "They do it differently, and we have given them free
reins as well. We have the overall [responsibility], but the
cooperating teachers do it their way and have their own pri-
orities" (TE-UC2). On one level, this might be an expression
of different ways teacher educators work with the cooperat-
ing teachers. It was for instance expressed that "it is a goal
that there should be close contact [between us] in order to
have understanding and respect and so on" (TE-UC2).
However, it might also be understood in the sense that the
content and the purpose of the practicum are unclear, or as
we have highlighted above, that the different groups have
different views about what is most important during practi-
cum. This disagreement is, for instance, expressed through
the emphasis put on trying out the everyday work of PE
teachers in contrast to the need for reflection and meta-
perspective on the practicum experiences.
Discussion
In this study, our interest has first and foremost been how the
teacher educators and cooperating teachers understand or
express their educational partnership in PETE. Based on our
findings, we argue that the teacher educators and the cooper-
ating teachers are involved in networks at a national level in
the sense that they refer to reading the national curricula. In
earlier articles reporting student teacher data from this proj-
ect, we found, however, that the practicum was organized dif-
ferently not only between, but also within, the various UCs
(Moen & Standal, 2014; Standal et al., 2014). This suggests
that the national guidelines result in highly different practices
across UCs. In this present study, the most prevalent network
identified between the cooperating teacher and the teacher
educators was at a local level in the sense that networks
between teacher educators and cooperating teachers seem to
exist as personal cooperation between the two groups.
However, we have identified different types of personal coop-
eration between the two groups as well as within the groups in
how these networks are expressed. Before discussing the
nature of these networks, we want to discuss how the two
groups perceived their roles in relation to practicum.
Moen and Standal 7
Considering the roles, a concept that in sociological terms
is understood as "the pattern of behaviours and expectations
associated with a position" (Roberts, 2009, p. 240), our study
shows that the teacher educators and the cooperating teacher
first and foremost have a common understanding that the
teacher educators take care of the students' theoretical
knowledge development, whereas cooperating teachers
focus on the reality aspect of teaching. This is consistent with
what earlier research describes as the theory­practice frag-
mentation in teacher education. The fragmentation is
addressed in the national curricula where the aim of an inte-
grated teacher education is highlighted (UFD, 2003a, 2003b,
2010). However, despite such aims in policy documents, our
study shows that there still is a polarization on how cooperat-
ing teachers and teacher educators expressed their contribu-
tion to the practicum in PETE. This came to the surface with
regard to how the teacher educators were more inclined to
take a meta-perspective on the practicum experiences,
whereas the cooperating teachers focused on the everyday
life of teaching. Thus, based on our analysis, it can be sug-
gested that despite intentions in the national curricula, the
roles expressed by cooperating teachers and teacher educa-
tors, respectively, seem to reinforce a traditional theory ver-
sus practice dichotomy.
The traditional theory­practice fragmentation expressed
in our material is one where there is a sharp, but rather naïve,
separation of theory belonging in UCs and practice in the
schools where practicum takes place. This is indeed also a
finding from other studies of practicum (Hegender, 2010).
Our point here is not to analyze the epistemological assump-
tions held by the groups involved in the practicum, but to
discuss whether and how this way of talking about theory
and practice can be seen as an expression of an educational
partnership. One issue we would like to raise here is that in
the context of PETE, there is an added dimension to such a
theory­practice discussion as compared with GTE, because
the line of conflict between theory and practice proponents
(to use an overly crude distinction) does not only run between
the prioritization of pedagogy and subject matter. In PE(TE),
it is also a point that the subject matter is itself practical (that
is, PE is one of the practical­aesthetical subjects). This, we
suggest, may make the polarization between theory and prac-
tice slightly different from that in GTE. Hence, the point of
our analysis is not how our informants talk about theory and
practice but that this talk expresses commitment to the roles
as "someone taking care of theory" or "someone taking care
of practice." PE in higher education has, similar to other pro-
fessional groups, seen an increased academization in the
sense that there has been a growing number of PhDs and
more focus on research (Backman & Larsson, 2013). What
we found in this study was a tension between those who align
themselves with this academization and those who are more
concerned with the craftsmanship of teaching. Despite the
most common finding of polarization between the two
groups, some cooperating teachers and teacher educators
highlighted the need for more collegial relationship between
these two groups. Hence, some of them expressed their roles
as providing mutual contribution toward PETE in line with
the expectations in the national curricula (UFD, 2003a,
2003b, 2010). In addition, we also found that the academiza-
tion of PETE was criticized not only by cooperating teachers
(e.g., the point that teacher educators have little or no real
experience teaching PE) but also by teacher educators. Thus,
when it comes to the power struggles of what PETE should
be about, it is not so much the roles that are in opposition to
each other as it is the viewpoints held by members of the two
groups.
Our study revealed differentiated understandings of how
the cooperating teachers and teacher educators view their
roles and respective contribution in PETE. On a practical
level, our study identified differentiated forms of personal
cooperation or networks between the two groups. In figura-
tional theory, interdependency is a central concept (Elias,
1978). Focusing on interdependencies within particular net-
works enables the researcher to conceptualize the relation-
ships between various people, in this case, between teacher
educators and cooperating teachers. The most obvious coop-
eration or network we identified was the meetings that took
place during practicum: the practicum visits of the teacher
educators. In line with the differentiated understanding of
their roles, our findings suggest that the cooperating teachers
and teacher educators also had different understandings of
the intention or relevance of these visits. Although the coop-
erating teachers rarely talked about these visits, the teacher
educators experienced the visits as important to check out
how the students were taken care of in practicum. However,
if they experienced problematic issues, they did not address
these during the visit. Hence, a clear finding in our study is
the interdependent nature and consequent power relation
between the two groups.
In figurational theory, power is viewed as an inevitable
aspect of all human relationships and exists within all figura-
tions (de Swaan, 2001; Elias, 1978; van Krieken, 1998);
power is viewed as an aspect of relationships between peo-
ple. There is always a certain balance of power within a net-
work, involving struggles between interdependent and
more-or-less powerful groups. Supporting earlier research
(Mordal-Moen & Green, 2014; Velija, Capel, Katene &
Hayes, 2008), our study shows that the cooperating teachers
and, to some extent, the teacher educators, think the cooper-
ating teachers manage the most important knowledge base
for the students to achieve in PETE. This is also in line with
the findings from, for instance, Hegender (2010) who found
that in the context of practicum, it was the procedural knowl-
edge in practice that was prioritized over propositional
knowledge for practice. In this sense, it appears that the
cooperating teachers are the ones in position of power in the
cooperating teacher­teacher educator relationship.
Our study also shows that the cooperating teachers have
much autonomy in defining their role. To capture the reality
8 SAGE Open
of day-to-day power relations and interdependencies within
communities, Elias has developed a model for social rela-
tions resolving around the concept of relations between
established and outsider groups, which refer to uneven power
balance between these two groups, where the former group is
the powerful (van Krieken, 1998). Related to our study, two
issues are relevant. On one hand, the teacher educators
explicitly expressed that they were in charge of practicum
and that they gave instructions to the cooperating teachers of
what to focus on in practicum. This might be an indication
that they viewed themselves as the insiders and powerful
players in the cooperating teacher­teacher educator network.
However, a much more prevalent finding, which gives an
impression that the teacher educators were more of an out-
sider in the network, was the fact that they gave the cooperat-
ing teachers rather free reins when it came to the content in
practicum. This impression of the teacher educators being
the outsiders was also strengthened by the emphasis teacher
educators put on being and acting as visitors at the practicum
schools. Adding to this, it appears that teacher educators
avoid conflicts if they experience difficult issues when visit-
ing in practicum. On the other hand, teacher educators have
a certain possibility to end the contract with schools or coop-
erating teachers who do not fulfill the requirements expected,
as one teacher educator mentioned. However, this requires
that the UCs indeed can pick and choose which schools and
cooperating teachers they send students to. In cases where
the UCs are in shortage of schools and cooperating teachers,
the threat implied by the teacher educators is not very real.
It is an aim that PETE has to be an integrated teacher edu-
cation where teacher educators and cooperating teachers act
in mutual partnership. We question whether the uneven
power balance between the outsiders (teacher educators) and
the established groups (the cooperating teacher) identified in
this study is productive to fulfill the aim of an ideal practi-
cum as a joint enterprise carried out in cooperation between
teacher educators and cooperating teachers (UFD, 2003a,
2003b, 2010). Earlier research shows that it is left to student
teachers to integrate practical experiences and theoretical
knowledge in PETE (Larsson, 2009; Mordal-Moen & Green,
2012, 2014; Velija et al., 2008). The findings from our study
of the power imbalance between cooperating teacher and
teacher educators may shed light on why the students are left
alone to make the connection between theory and practicum
(practice).
Concluding Remarks
A limitation of the present study is that it only involved
focus group interviews of cooperating teachers from two of
the three UCs in our sample. Another limitation is the fact
that the focus groups interviews were held separately
between the two groups. Although we experienced that both
cooperating teachers and teacher educators were willing to
share their experiences, arranging focus groups with the two
groups together may have revealed more in-depth under-
standings of their contrasting viewpoints regarding their
educational partnership. However, putting them together
may also have limited their opportunity to speak freely
about the viewpoints and experiences of the other group, as
we think they have been able to in this project. For further
research, we suggest focus group interviews of teacher edu-
cators and cooperating teachers together in the same inter-
view to be an interesting project, as well as observational
studies, which emphasize the practicum visits of the teacher
educators.
Although practicum emerges as an important part of
PETE, little research is devoted to specifically investigate
the practicum, and research on how cooperating teachers and
teacher educators understand or express their educational
partnership, or mutual contribution, to the practicum aspect
of PETE is absent from the literature. The aim of this project
has been to shed light on the interdependent networks
between these two groups. Drawing on sensitizing concepts
from figurational sociology, our study has identified that the
cooperating teachers are the powerful players (insiders) in
the cooperating teacher­teacher educator network. Hence,
the aim of a mutual cooperation between the groups in pract-
icum seems not to be fulfilled. Our research may help us
understand why it seems hard to reach the aim in the national
curriculum of a mutual contribution (partnership) in practi-
cum. In particular, we want to draw attention to our findings
showing the power struggles between the two groups, as well
as the differentiated understandings the cooperating teachers
and the teacher educators have of their roles related to practi-
cum. In this regard, our study highlights many of the same
challenges for cooperation as found in the Irish cooperating
physical education teacher program (COPET) (Belton et al.,
2010; Dunning et al., 2011; Meegan et al., 2013). Organizing
the cooperation around shared workshops and documents
appears to be a promising route to follow. What our study has
contributed with is the realization that the teacher educators
and cooperating teachers do not necessarily represent two
isolated and polarized camps: There are commitments to
ideas about the nature and purpose of practicum that cut
across membership to the groups. This, in our view, increases
the need to develop programs and models similar to COPET.
However, such models must take into account national and
local policies.
The policy implications of this kind of research appear
clear-cut: For teacher educators to have greater influence--
in the sense of being more involved about what student
teachers experience during practicum--it may be necessary
for them to be more involved in teaching in the schools their
student teachers are placed, perhaps even alongside the stu-
dent teachers and cooperating teachers. Further, we suggest
that inviting the cooperating teachers to teach on campus
may help reduce the gap between the insiders (cooperating
teachers) and the outsiders (teacher educators) identified in
this study.

Note
1. Folkehøgskole, or "Folk high schools," are 1-year boarding
schools offering a variety of exciting non-traditional and non-
academic subjects, as well as academic subjects. The idea of
folk high schools is learning for life, an opportunity to grow
both individually, socially, and academically in small learning
communities. All students live on campus in close contact with
staff and their fellow students. One important part of the folk
high school experience is to form a community, in and out of
class. The students are normally between 18 and 25 years old
(Folkehøgskole, 2011).
