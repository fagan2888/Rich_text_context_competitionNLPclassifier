Generation Vexed:
Age-Cohort Differences In
Employer-Sponsored Health
Insurance Coverage
Even when today's young adults get older, they are likely to have lower rates
of employer-related health coverage than their elders have today.
by Sherry Glied and Mark Stabile
Over the past two decades the
rate of employer-sponsored health in-
surance coverage has dropped mark-
edly, although the decline has not been
smooth. This downward trend has been con-
centrated among young adults. Today, unlike
twenty years ago, there is a substantial gap in
employer-sponsored coverage between young
adults and their elders.
How should policymakers respond to this?
That depends critically on whether these low
rates are transitory or permanent. If young
adults gain insurance coverage as they grow
older, then policymakers need to develop
models that serve them during their transition
to employer-sponsored insurance. If, con-
versely, low coverage rates in young adult-
hood presage continuing low rates, policy-
makers need to develop not age-specific but
cohort-specific models that address perma-
nent problems.
Employer-sponsored coverage is an out-
come of the functioning of both the labor mar-
ket and the health insurance market. Prior
studies have generally concluded that labor-
market changes, such as shifts in the distribu-
tion of employment across industries, have
had only minor effects on coverage.1 Most of
the change in employer-sponsored insurance
appears to be a consequence of increases in
the overall cost of coverage and in the em-
ployee contribution requirement.2
Our focus here is on the extent to which
low (or high) rates of coverage among young
adults persist within cohorts over time. This
approach parallels a large literature in labor
economics that has examined the earnings ex-
perience of cohorts over time. Earnings in the
labor market tend to grow with experience
and to improve as the economy becomes more
productive. Many researchers have found,
however, that the unusually large U.S. popu-
lation cohorts born during the baby boom ex-
perienced persistently depressed wages rela-
tive to cohorts that preceded them--even as
they grew older and the economy prospered.3
Declines in earnings were sharpest for baby
boomers who did not graduate from college.
Despite economywide improvements in pro-
ductivity, these workers never did as well as
prior generations.
In this paper we replicate the methods
used in the analyses of cohort earnings to ana-
lyze changes in employer-sponsored health
insurance rates along three lines: the effect of
secular time trends, the effect of growing
older and gaining labor-market experience,
and the effect of birth cohort.

Data And Methods
We use data on persons ages twenty-five to
fifty from the March demographic supple-
ment of the Current Population Survey (CPS)
for the years 1980­1999. The CPS is a national
survey of approximately 50,000 households
each month.4 In each year the CPS asks
whether or not a respondent is covered by
employer-sponsored health insurance and, if
yes, whether this coverage was made available
through a current or former employer (or that
of a family member). We define having em-
ployer-sponsored coverage to include anyone
covered by such coverage, whether in one's
own name or through a family member.
The CPS health insurance questions
changed several times during the 1980­1999
period. In general, these changes had little ef-
fect on the employer-sponsored coverage
questions.5 All of our analyses include a vari-
able for each 1980­1999 CPS year. These
dummy variables capture any residual effects
of questionnaire changes that affect the entire
population. All analyses are weighted using
the CPS weights.
To compare changes in health insurance to
changes in earnings, we repeat our analyses
for health insurance using information on
weekly wages. We adjust all wages for infla-
tion to 1980 dollars using the all-items Con-
sumer Price Index (CPI).6
We construct cohorts in the CPS data by
following successive age groups over time. For
example, the cohort born in 1952 was thirty
years old in 1982. In 1987 the members of that
cohort were five years older. The experience
of the group is then captured by the experi-
ence of thirty-five-year-olds in 1987. In gen-
eral, the sample of thirty-five-year-olds in 1987
is representative of the same population as the
sample ofthirty-year-olds in 1982. We restrict
the sample for regression to cohorts born be-
tween 1940 and 1965 so that we have at least
ten observations for each cohort in the data.
In further analyses, we compare the expe-
rience of different education groups. We de-
fine these groups according to highest level of
education completed: (1) did not complete
high school; (2) received a high school di-
ploma but had no further education; (3) at-
tended college or postsecondary technical
training but did not receive a degree; (4) re-
ceived a college degree or higher.
We perform the decomposition by com-
puting linear regressions that include age
components, time-trend components, and co-
hort components. We specify the age compo-
nent by including terms for ages 26­30, ages
31­35, ages 36­40, ages 41­45, and ages 46­50.
The age components are measured relative to
twenty-five-year-olds.7 We are interested in
learning whether the transition to employer
coverage has changed over time. We test this
by including a second set ofterms for the same
age groups in the period after 1988 (the mid-
point of our sample). These terms show
whether the effect of being ages 26­30 is dif-
ferent after 1988 than before 1989.8 We specify
time-trend components by including a
dummy variable for each CPS year included in
our analysis. We measure the trend compo-
nents relative to 1989. We specify the cohort
components using a series of dummy variables
for each birth cohort year. We measure cohort
components relative to the cohort born in 1955.
The coefficients we estimate in these
analyses describe relative coverage rates.
Rather than listing them, we plot the coeffi-
cients in a series of graphs that describe
trends over age, time, or cohort (after control-
ling for each of the other variables). The verti-
cal axes of these graphs show the estimated
difference in insurance coverage associated
with different values of that component (age,
time trend, or cohort) relative to the base
category for that component.
Study Results
n Changes in age profile. Exhibit 1 shows
how levels of employer-sponsored health cov-
erage change as people age. The exhibit shows
two profiles, one for the period before 1989
and one for the period 1989 and beyond. The
upward slope of both age profiles shows that
levels of employer-sponsored health insur-
ance increase as people age. However, exam-
ining the difference between the two profiles
reveals that the rate at which health insurance

coverage increases with age has changed over
time. The post-1988 profile is steeper than the
pre-1989 profile, which suggests that after
1988 employer-sponsored health insurance
coverage levels increased more rapidly be-
tween the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four.9
The shift in the age profile suggests that
some of the decline in coverage experienced
by today's younger adults will be made up as
they grow older. Holding other factors con-
stant, group coverage of today's twenty-five-
year-olds is likely to increase nearly eight per-
centage points by the time they reach their
mid-thirties. The changing age profile, how-
ever, does not fully explain the changes in
health insurance coverage over time.
n Changes over time. Exhibit 2 shows
the pattern of employer-sponsored health
coverage over time relative to 1988 levels. The
pattern over time reflects changes in eco-
nomic conditions and changes to the CPS
health insurance questionnaire. The apparent
jump in coverage between 1994 and 1995 al-
most certainly reflects concurrent question-
naire changes.10 The data also suggest that
questionnaire changes between 1987 and 1988
had little effect in this population. These re-
sults suggest that the decline in health insur-
ance coverage over this period ended in 1994,
after controlling for cohort and age effects.
n Effects of cohort of birth. Finally, we
examine the effects of cohort of birth on the
pattern of employer-sponsored health cover-
age. Exhibit 3 shows the percentage-point
change in coverage relative to the cohort born
in 1955. Health insurance coverage rates
peaked for the cohort born in 1947, just as the
baby boom began. There has been a steady
decline in coverage for subsequent cohorts. At
each age, health insurance coverage rates for
the cohort born in 1947 have been about three
percentage points higher than rates for the
cohort born in 1955.
n Breakdown by education groups.
Next, we repeat the analyses above for each of
the four education groups listed earlier. We
find a large and statistically significant change
in the age profile of employer-sponsored
health coverage after 1988 for the least-
educated group (controlling, once again, for
year and cohort effects), a small but signifi-
cant change for those with college education,
and a small and insignificant change in the age
profile for groups with high school and some

college education. In the less-educated groups
the age profile becomes slightly steeper. The
difference between coverage rates at age
twenty-five and at age thirty-five is about six
percentage points greater in the later period
for those with less than a high school educa-
tion and about two percentage points greater
for those with a high school education. For
groups with a high school education or less,
however, the entire age profile, while becom-
ing steeper, also shifts downward. This shift
is so large that the earlier and later profiles do
not cross within the sample age range.
The time-series profile of coverage by edu-
cation group, controlling for age and cohort
effects, is described in Exhibit 4. Over time,
the propensity of the most highly educated
workers to obtain employer-sponsored health
insurance coverage has remained flat.11 By
contrast, the least-educated workers have ex-
perienced a continuous decline in the propen-
sity to hold employer-sponsored coverage
over time. Comparing this graph to the time
trend of the unemployment rate reveals that
declines in the unemployment rate are corre-
lated with increases in coverage for all but the
most-educated groups.12 For the least edu-
cated, however, the effect of cyclical improve-
ments has been swamped by the downward
trend in coverage over time.
Exhibit 5 illustrates cohort patterns of cov-
erage for these four education groups, control-
ling for age and year effects. Health insurance
coverage has remained relatively flat in co-
horts born since 1950 among those in each
group except those with a high school di-
ploma. Cohorts of high school­educated
workers born since 1947 have seen steady de-
clines in their propensity to hold health insur-
ance, with a slight uptick in the youngest co-
horts in the sample.
Explaining The Pattern:
Comparison To Wage Effects
In designing policy, it would be useful to
know whether health insurance coverage pat-
terns parallel changes in earnings. If insurance
coverage and earnings have moved separately,
policy changes in the health insurance market
might enable cohorts with poor employer-

sponsored coverage to purchase their own in-
surance. If, however, earnings declines have
paralleled coverage declines, cohorts without
coverage are also likely to lack the earnings to
take advantage of market reforms.
We repeat our analysis to examine the age,
time-trend, and cohort patterns on weekly
wages. First, we find that the experience pro-
file in earnings fully replicates the profile for
health insurance. Second, we find a down-
ward trend over time in earnings for less-edu-
cated workers. However, the decline in cover-
age rates is much steeper than the decline in
wages. For college-educated workers, earn-
ings rise over time, but coverage is flat. The
difference in the time-trend patterns for earn-
ings and health insurance across all groups
reflects the rising cost of health insurance
relative to earnings over time.13 We also find
that health insurance is more sensitive to
business-cycle fluctuations than are wages.
This is not surprising, since health insurance
is contingent on employment, and employ-
ment changes tend to be stronger than wage
changes over a business cycle.
Third, we find, as does the prior literature,
a decline in the earnings of cohorts of high
school­educated workers over time.14 The de-
cline in earnings for this group is less pro-
nounced than is the decline we find in the
health insurance data. One explanation for
the more pronounced decline in benefits than
in wages for high school­educated cohorts
born after 1950 may be the decline in unioni-
zation.15 Union jobs are much more likely to
offer benefits than are nonunion jobs, and
high school­educated workers are more likely
than other groups are to have been affected by
the decline in private-sector unionization.
As in the health insurance data, there is
little pronounced cohort pattern for workers
with less than a high school education. In the

wage data, in contrast to the health insurance
data, cohorts of college-educated workers
born after the mid-1950s show consistent in-
creases in wages. This divergence suggests
that persons in this group are most likely to be
able to take advantage of market reforms that
make it easier to buy health insurance.
Interpreting The Results
The results described above can best be un-
derstood by considering their implications for
the health insurance experiences of different
groups. Consider, for example, the group of
high school­educated adults born in 1956.
The age pattern for this group suggests that
their health coverage should have increased
by four percentage points between ages
twenty-five and thirty-five. The time-trend
component, however, shows that employer-
sponsored insurance for high school­
educated adults fell six percentage points be-
tween 1981 (when the cohort born in 1957
were twenty-five years old) and 1991 (when
they were thirty-five). The combination of
these two effects meant that for this cohort,
insurance coverage rates at age thirty-five
were actually lower than their rates were at
age twenty-five. Rather than gaining em-
ployer-sponsored insurance coverage with
age, this cohort actually lost it.
Now consider the high school­educated
cohort born seven years later, in 1963. When
this cohort turned twenty-five (in 1988), eco-
nomic conditions overall for high school­
educated workers were much as they were
five years earlier. Nonetheless, this later co-
hort experienced a substantial decline in eco-
nomic well-being and health insurance cover-
age compared with the 1956 cohort. At age
twenty-five, their health insurance rates were
fully 4.2 percentage points lower than those of
their older counterparts were. The time-
series profile for high school­educated work-
ers declined over the next ten years, so that,
again, this cohort had lower rates of coverage
at age thirty-five than at age twenty-five.
Policy Implications
The existence of age-related and cyclical com-
ponents of coverage has several implications
for policy. First, young adults move into cov-
erage as they grow older. Policies that make it

easier for young adults to make the transition
to employer-sponsored coverage could flatten
the experience profile. Second, coverage rates
move with the business cycle. These fluctua-
tions are sharpest for poorly educated work-
ers. Policies that offer ways for these workers
to obtain or maintain coverage during down-
turns could smooth cyclical patterns.
The results described above also docu-
ment, however, that there is a strong perma-
nent component to changes in employer-
sponsored health coverage over the past two
decades. This affects health insurance plan-
ning decisions. For example, projections of
the number of older Americans who will be
uninsured are likely to be more accurate if
they build on cohort patterns than if they ex-
trapolate from the experience of today's sixty-
year-olds.16
The permanent component is strongest for
high school­educated workers, who also ex-
perienced a sharp decline in earnings over this
period. For more recent cohorts, those born
since 1963, this decline appears to have ended;
rates have improved slightly but remain well
below those of a generation earlier. The exist-
ence of this permanent component implies
that even if economic conditions and health
care costs remain relatively stable, future rates
of employer-sponsored insurance coverage for
these cohorts are likely to remain well below
those of previous cohorts.
This implies that more expansive policies
will be needed to sustain increases in health

coverage. Rather than targeting an age group
or a group undergoing a distinct economic
transition, policies need to make insurance
available for extended periods to people de-
fined by income, not age or employment
status. This coverage might be offered
through employers or through other venues
that we have not considered in this paper,
such as private nongroup or public coverage.17
The depressed earnings of this group suggest
that the private nongroup market is unlikely
to be a viable source of coverage, unless sub-
stantial subsidies are offered. Public coverage
might be an option, but this coverage is gener-
ally not available to working adults ages
twenty-five to fifty. Subsidies that enable
workers to purchase coverage through their
own employers also may help members of co-
horts with poor health insurance prospects.
Finally, the decline in employer-sponsored
health insurance coverage across cohorts of
workers with only a high school education
should be considered when the overall eco-
nomic well-being of this group is being evalu-
ated. For these Americans, declines in insur-
ance coverage exacerbate an already negative
trend in income.
