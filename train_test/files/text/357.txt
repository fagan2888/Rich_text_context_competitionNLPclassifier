RESULTS
Stratification analyses
As shown in Table 1, prior to stratification for age,
mortality secondary to sepsis was approximately 100- to
300-fold higher in HD and PD patients compared with
the GP. DM was associated with higher mortality caused
by sepsis across all populations. In the GP and in RTRs,
black race was associated with higher mortality rates

tality rates secondary to sepsis are one to several hundred
fold higher in HD and PD patients compared with the
GP, despite stratification for age. The presence of ESRD,
per se, acted as a greater risk factor for septic deaths
compared with gender, race, or DM. In addition, stratifi-

alter the magnitude of this difference. It is important to
note, however, that the difference in mortality between
the two groups cannot be solely ascribed to dialysis ac-
cess-related infections. Indeed, HD- and PD-related ac-
cess infections account for only 11 and 35% of deaths
secondary to sepsis, respectively [1]. Therefore, the pres-
