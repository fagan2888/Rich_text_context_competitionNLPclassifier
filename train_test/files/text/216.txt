The traditional method for assessing the severity of influenza seasons is to estimate the
associated increase (i.e., excess) in pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality. In this study,
excess P&I hospitalizations were estimated from National Hospital Discharge Survey Data
from 26 influenza seasons (1970­1995). The average seasonal rate of excess P&I hospitalization
was 49 (range, 8­102)/100,000 persons, but average rates were twice as high during A(H3N2)
influenza seasons as during A(H1N1)/B seasons. Persons aged !65 years had 57% of all in-
fluenza-related hospitalizations; however, the average seasonal risk for influenza-related P&I
hospitalizations was much higher in the elderly than in persons aged !65 years. The 26 pairs
of excess P&I hospitalization and mortality rates were linearly correlated. During the A(H3N2)
influenza seasons after the 1968 pandemic, excess P&I hospitalizations declined among persons
aged !65 years but not among the elderly. This suggests that influenza-related hospitalizations
will increase disproportionately among younger persons in future pandemics.
Influenza epidemics occur seasonally in temperate climates
and result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Since William
Farr's [1] studies of influenza-related mortality in London
(1847­1848), various statistical models have been used to assess
the severity of such epidemics. In particular, models have been
used to estimate "excess" numbers of pneumonia and influenza
(P&I) deaths (i.e., above an expected baseline of P&I deaths
in the absence of influenza) during periods when influenza vi-
ruses are in circulation [2­8].
However, mortality is a relatively rare outcome of influenza
infection and represents only a fraction of influenza's total
health burden in a population [2, 9, 10]. In addition, although
influenza A(H3N2) epidemics usually result in increased excess
hospitalizations and deaths, some influenza A(H1N1) and in-
fluenza B epidemics result only in increased hospitalizations
and not increased mortality [9]. Because of these considerations,
some investigators have suggested that measurements of excess
P&I mortality alone may inadequately reflect the severity of an
influenza season [11].
Our primary objective was to determine national estimates
of excess P&I hospitalizations and the relationship between
such hospitalizations and excess P&I deaths during influenza
seasons characterized by all currently circulating influenza virus
types and subtypes. A second objective was to determine
whether excess P&I hospitalizations among persons aged !65

years declined over time in the influenza A(H3N2) seasons after
the 1968 influenza A(H3N2) pandemic. We previously observed
a pattern of declining excess P&I deaths among this age group,
but not in elderly persons, following each of the 20th century's
3 pandemics [12].
Methods
Definition of P&I hospitalizations and deaths. A P&I hospi-
talization was defined as a hospitalization for which an Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for pneumonia or in-
fluenza (ICD-8 codes 474 or 480­486 for 1970­1978 and ICD-9
codes 480­487 for 1979­1995) was listed as the first diagnosis on
the discharge record. These codes include bacterial and viral pneu-
monia of known and unknown etiology [13, 14]. A P&I death was
defined as one in which an ICD code for pneumonia or influenza
was coded as the underlying cause of death.
Definition of influenza seasons. Because influenza seasons usu-
ally include winter months, they typically bridge consecutive cal-
endar years (e.g., 1970­1971). We used national influenza virus
surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) to define an influenza season. The average weekly
number of influenza virus identifications was calculated for each
October during 1969­1995. An influenza season was defined as the
months in which the number of virus identifications for 1 week
was more than twice the weekly average number of virus identi-
fications for the preceding October. The remaining months were
considered outside the influenza season.
Each influenza season was further defined on the basis of the
predominant circulating viruses. An influenza A(H3N2) season was
defined as a season in which A(H3N2) viruses comprised 75%
of that season's total influenza isolates. An influenza A(H1N1)/
influenza B season was defined as a season in which one or both
of these viruses together comprised 75% of the season's influenza
isolates. A mixed season was defined as one in which neither in-
fluenza A(H3N2) virus nor the combined number of influenza

levels are indicated for each season.
A(H1N1) and influenza B viruses accounted for 75% of the sea-
son's isolates.
Data source for P&I hospitalizations. National Hospitalization
Discharge Survey (NHDS) data were obtained for 1970­1995 from
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) [15]. Although
NHDS data were not available before 1970, we were able to analyze
26 consecutive influenza seasons including the 1969­1970 influenza
season, because the first month of that season was January 1970.
NHDS data are collected from 200,000 hospital discharge re-
cords, representing a sample of 1% of all US hospitalizations [15].
The hospital discharge records are collected by a stratified multi-
stage probability sampling design in which each record is assigned
a weight. The national total of hospitalizations can be estimated
from the sum of the weights. Each NHDS record contains up to
7 ICD-coded discharge diagnoses, usually listed in the order of
their appearance on the original hospital discharge record. We ex-
tracted all hospital discharge records fitting our definition of a P&I
hospitalization and retained the weight variable, the patient's age,
and a hospital admission date (month and year). For each of the
26 years studied, national monthly numbers of P&I hospitalizations
were calculated for all ages and for 2 age groups (!65 and 65
years).
Validation of NHDS data for estimating monthly hospitaliza-
tions. In 1987, a sizable fraction of NHDS hospitals began pro-
viding discharge records for only a subset of months each year [15].
Since this potentially introduced a bias for the analysis of seasonal
data, we validated the use of monthly NHDS data for estimating
excess P&I hospitalizations during influenza seasons. A special
NHDS data set was provided by the NCHS for 1988­1993 that
included a variable (not found in the publicly available database)
identifying "partially" participating hospitals (i.e., those submitting
records for some months) and "fully" participating hospitals (i.e.,
those submitting records for all months). We determined that the
monthly P&I hospitalization records submitted by the partially
participating hospitals accounted for 10%­25% of the yearly total
P&I records from NHDS for those 6 years (corresponding to
9%­22% of US yearly total P&I hospitalizations). The monthly
data from the partially participating hospitals exhibited a seasonal
pattern of P&I hospitalizations, similar to the public data set, in-
cluding peaks during the same months within the influenza seasons.
We concluded that the potential bias was minimal and that the
NHDS public use data were suitable for analysis of monthly P&I
hospitalization data.
Estimation of excess P&I hospitalizations. A method recently
developed for analyzing monthly P&I mortality data was used to
estimate excess P&I hospitalizations during each influenza season
[12]. In brief, a baseline was constructed of the number of expected
P&I hospitalizations in winter months in which influenza was ab-
sent. First, a 3-month moving average of P&I hospitalizations was
calculated for 24 Novembers between January 1970 and December
1995 that were not considered part of any influenza season. We
then raised this November baseline to best fit the level of P&I
hospitalizations in the month of December during 6 seasons in
which the influenza period started in January or later. This was
achieved by iteratively adding a constant to the November baseline
level until the squared distance between the increased November
baseline and the December estimates was minimized. The sum of
P&I hospitalizations above the December baseline during an in-
fluenza season was considered excess hospitalizations attributable
to influenza.
Seasonal numbers and rates of excess P&I hospitalizations were
calculated for the total population and for the age groups !65 and
65 years by use of US census data (e.g., the 1970 census for the
1970­1971 season). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis: when
the baseline levels of expected P&I hospitalizations were varied
upward or downward by 30%, there was a 14% decrease and in-
crease, respectively, in the estimated numbers of excess P&I
hospitalizations.
Comparison of excess P&I hospitalizations and deaths during in-
fluenza seasons. US multiple-cause-of-death data tapes were ob-
tained from the NCHS for 1970­1995 [16]. The same methods for
calculating excess P&I hospitalizations were used to estimate excess
P&I deaths for the 26 influenza seasons during 1970­1995. We used
the restricted least squares method to compare seasonal estimates
of excess P&I hospitalizations rates and excess P&I death rates
[17]. Separate comparisons were made for persons aged !65 and

Results
Seasonality and trends in P&I hospitalizations. The average
influenza season in this study was 4 months (range, 3­6 months;
table 1). P&I hospitalizations exhibited a seasonal pattern (sim-
ilar to P&I deaths), with peaks during winter months and
troughs during summer months (figure 1). The largest absolute
monthly numbers of P&I hospitalizations occurred during the
1975­1976 and 1989­1990 influenza seasons (figure 1), which
are considered 2 of the most severe influenza seasons since the
1968 A(H3N2) pandemic on the basis of excess P&I mortality
estimates [8].
We also observed a significant increase in the monthly num-
bers of P&I hospitalizations during periods outside the influ-
enza seasons over the study period (figure 1). This upward
secular trend was due to an almost 2-fold increase in the in-
cidence rate of P&I hospitalizations outside influenza seasons
among persons aged 65 years during the study period. By
contrast, P&I hospitalizations among persons aged !65 years
outside the influenza seasons declined by 12% during the study
period (data not shown).
Excess P&I hospitalizations by virus (sub)type. The aver-
age number of excess P&I hospitalizations per influenza season
was 114,000 (range, 16,000­220,000), corresponding to an av-
erage incidence rate of 49 excess P&I hospitalizations per
100,000 persons (range, 8­102; table 1). These figures varied
substantially by season depending on the predominating influ-
enza virus(es).
During the 12 influenza A(H3N2) seasons, the average num-
ber of excess P&I hospitalizations per season was 142,000 (in-
cidence rate of 63 excess P&I hospitalizations per 100,000 pop-
ulation). Among these A(H3N2) seasons, the lowest excess P&I
hospitalization incidence rate (all are per 100,000 population)
was 37 in 1982­1983 and 1984­1985, and the highest (102) was
in 1975­1976 (table 1). During the 9 influenza A(H1N1) or
influenza B seasons, the average number of excess P&I hos-
pitalizations was 74,000 (rate of 32 excess P&I hospitalizations).
The lowest rate of excess P&I hospitalizations for these seasons
occurred in 1981­1982 (8), whereas the highest rates occurred
during the 1985­1986 and 1988­1989 seasons (48). During the

seasons, 1970­1995. Year and season type (as defined for this study) are indicated.
5 mixed influenza virus seasons, the average number of excess
P&I hospitalizations was 120,000 (rate of excess P&I hospi-
talizations, 48). The figures for the mixed seasons and the
proportion of influenza A(H3N2) viruses varied considerably
(table 1).
Excess P&I hospitalizations by age group. Among persons
!65 years of age, the average number of excess P&I hospital-
izations per season was 64,000, corresponding to an incidence
rate of 33 excess P&I hospitalizations per 100,000 population.
In persons aged 65 years, the average number of excess P&I
hospitalizations each season was 48,000 (174 excess P&I hos-
pitalizations per 100,000 elderly; table 1).
For all seasons, the median and mean relative risks of influ-
enza-related P&I hospitalizations among persons aged 65
years compared with those aged !65 years were 4.1 and 6.4,
respectively. In absolute numbers, however, 57% of all excess
P&I hospitalizations each season occurred among persons !65
years of age. This proportion was similar when seasons were
stratified by circulating virus (sub)types. For both younger and
older age groups, excess P&I hospitalization rates were 2 times
higher during A(H3N2) seasons than in A(H1N1)/B seasons
(table 2).
Five influenza seasons (1970­1971, 1973­1974, 1976­1977,
1978­1979, and 1986­1987) associated with little or no excess
in P&I mortality had an average rate (SD) of 16.7  6.2
excess P&I hospitalizations per 100,000 population; almost all
of these hospitalizations occurred among people aged !65 years
(table 1). These influenza seasons were category 1 seasons with
respect to a mortality-based influenza severity index [8].
Relationship of excess P&I hospitalizations to excess P&I
deaths. During the 26 seasons studied, the pairs of excess
P&I hospitalization and excess P&I mortality rates were
strongly correlated (Pearson's , ; figure 2). The
r = 0.8 P ! .05
linear relationship was described by the following equa-
tion: P&I excess hospitalizations per 100,000 population =

However, 2 influenza A(H3N2) seasons (1984­1985 and
1987­1988) decreased significantly under the trend line, sug-
gesting that those seasons were associated with a higher ratio
of excess deaths to excess hospitalizations. One mixed virus
season (1992­1993) was significantly above the trend line, sug-
gesting a lower ratio of excess deaths to excess hospitalizations
for that season.
Age-specific pattern of influenza A(H3N2) hospitalization af-
ter the 1968 pandemic. Excess P&I hospitalizations during
the 1968­1969 influenza A(H3N2) pandemic could not be es-
timated because NHDS data were not collected before 1970.
However, we studied the excess P&I hospitalizations during the
subsequent 12 influenza A(H3N2) seasons. Among persons
aged !65 years, the average excess P&I hospitalization rate
during the first 5 influenza A(H3N2) seasons (1969­1976) was
60 per 100,000 population and decreased by about half during

An analysis of excess P&I mortality showed a similar pattern
of declining excess mortality rates in the younger age group
during A(H3N2) seasons following the 1968 pandemic (table

most recent A(H3N2) seasons, rates of excess P&I mortality
were 19 times higher during the 1968­1969 pandemic and 6
times higher during the next 5 A(H3N2) seasons. In contrast,
among the elderly, rates of excess P&I mortality were only 2
times higher during the 1968 pandemic than during the most
recent A(H3N2) seasons, and the pattern did not decline over
time.
Discussion
The national impact of influenza on hospitalizations has been
documented less well than the impact on mortality. We estimate
that during 26 consecutive influenza seasons from 1969­1970
through 1994­1995, 3 million excess P&I hospitalizations oc-
curred in the United States. Although average rates of excess
P&I hospitalizations were higher in the elderly (174/100,000
population) than in those aged !65 years (33/100,000 popu-
lation), the younger age group accounted for more than half
of the total number of influenza-related P&I hospitalizations.
In addition, the average number of excess P&I hospitalizations
was twice as high during seasons dominated by influenza
A(H3N2) viruses as during those dominated by influenza B/
A(H1N1) viruses.
Our findings are consistent with those reported by other in-
vestigators. In a study of influenza-related hospitalizations that
was also based on NHDS data, the authors estimated an av-
erage seasonal number of 172,000 excess P&I hospitalizations
for 5 severe influenza A seasons between 1970 and 1978 [10].
Although we used an entirely different statistical approach, we
estimated an average of 175,000 excess P&I hospitalizations for
the same 5 seasons. Previous studies also showed that excess
hospitalizations but not excess mortality could be documented
in some seasons dominated by influenza B and A(H1N1) viruses
[2, 9, 11]. We found that an average of 16.7 excess P&I hos-
pitalizations per 100,000 population occurred during the influ-
enza seasons without measurable excess in P&I mortality and
that most of those hospitalizations were among persons aged
!65 years. A key finding was that the overall seasonal numbers
836 Simonsen et al. JID 2000;181 (March)
of excess P&I deaths and excess P&I hospitalizations were lin-
early correlated, regardless of the predominant circulating types
or subtypes of influenza virus. This observation is useful, be-
cause it suggests that rates and numbers of excess P&I hos-
pitalizations can be extrapolated from national excess P&I mor-
tality estimates, which are calculated routinely in the United
States by the CDC.
Although some investigators have suggested that influenza-
related hospitalizations might provide a more sensitive index
than mortality for assessing the severity of individual influenza
epidemics [11], the direct annual estimation of excess P&I hos-
pitalizations poses some difficulties. First, hospitalization dis-
charge coding can be sensitive to changes in billing practices.
Second, NHDS data are derived from a 1% sample of US
hospitalizations, and estimates of seasonal excess P&I hospi-
talizations derived from the sample are subject to considerable
random error. Although Health Care Financial Administration
data cover most hospitalizations for persons aged 65 years
in the United States and could be utilized (see [18]), such studies
would allow only estimates of influenza-related hospitalizations
for the elderly population. By contrast, annual national esti-
mates of excess P&I mortality are based on complete mortality
records for the United States. Extrapolating hospitalization es-
timates from mortality estimates on the basis of the linear re-
lationship between overall excess P&I hospitalizations and ex-
cess P&I mortality and the other considerations would be a
reasonable approach for most years. In addition, the CDC's
ongoing surveillance for national P&I mortality data could be
used to generate timely preliminary estimates of P&I hospital-
izations after each influenza season [19]. However, for influenza
seasons in which an unusual relationship between mortality and
hospitalizations is suspected or for pandemic years in which
the introduction of a novel influenza virus is expected to result
in substantially elevated morbidity and mortality, direct cal-
culations of P&I hospitalizations would be preferable.
It is important to note that the analysis in this study was
limited to hospitalizations in which either pneumonia or influ-
enza (P&I) was listed as the first condition on the discharge
records. We did not attempt to estimate the total increase in
hospitalizations attributable to influenza. Rates of hospitali-
zations for other conditions, including acute bronchitis, chronic
respiratory disease, and congestive heart failure, may increase
during influenza seasons [18]. Another study would be needed
to estimate the total impact of influenza on hospitalizations.
The large overall increase in P&I hospitalization rates among
persons aged 65 years during periods outside influenza sea-
sons was consistent with a general increase in infectious disease
hospitalization rates among the elderly during the 1980s [20].
The basis for the increase is uncertain. It could reflect a true
increase in hospitalizations among the elderly, perhaps as a
result of the aging of that cohort, or, alternatively, changing
hospital reimbursement practices [20]. Regardless, our method
for establishing a baseline of expected P&I hospitalizations in
the absence of influenza adjusted for this secular trend in the
data.
A final observation of particular interest was the significant
decline in rates of excess P&I hospitalization among persons
aged !65 years during the influenza A(H3N2) seasons following
the 1968 pandemic. During the study period, persons aged !65
years accounted for a gradually declining proportion of excess
P&I hospitalizations from 70% to 40% in the influenza
A(H3N2) seasons after the 1968 pandemic. No similar decline
was seen in the elderly age group (table 3). In a previous study,
we described a similar, but even more dramatic, pattern for
influenza-related mortality following all 3 pandemics in this
century [12]. The major implication of these observations is
that excess hospitalizations and deaths during the next influenza
pandemic probably will increase substantially beyond rates in
recent A(H3N2) seasons among persons aged !65 years. By
contrast, rates of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths
among the elderly are almost always higher than in the younger
age group, and our findings suggest that rates of influenza-
related hospitalizations and deaths may increase only margin-
ally during the next pandemic. The potential for a dispropor-
tionate increase in rates of influenza-related hospitalizations
and deaths among persons aged !65 years during the next pan-
demic is important and should be taken into consideration by
those developing plans to diminish the health impact of the
next pandemic.
