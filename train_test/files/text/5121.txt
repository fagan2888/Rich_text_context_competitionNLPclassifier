Abstract: Sex differences in spatial cognition are well documented; males typically
outperform females on tasks dealing with mental rotation and spatial navigation,
while females tend to outperform males on tasks dealing with object location,
relational object location memory, or spatial working memory. Here we investigated
both behavioral and neural sex differences in sex-specific spatial abilities. In
Experiment 1, sixty-six (30 males, 36 females) participants completed computerized
mental rotation (MR) and spatial working memory (SWM) tasks. In Experiment 2,
twelve (6 males, 6 females) participants were given slightly modified versions of the
same tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In both
experiments, males outperformed females on the MR task, but no behavioral sex
difference was observed on the SWM task. Males showed more activation in left
parahippocampal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, inferior
frontal gyrus in the MR task . Females showed activation in the left parahippocampal
gyrus only. For the study condition of the spatial working memory task, females
showed activation in left inferior frontal gyrus, while males activated left inferior
parietal and medial frontal areas. In the test conditions, females showed activation in
the right inferior frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and left parahippocampal
gyrus. Males activated right medial frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe.
Interestingly, similar regions ­ parahippocampal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, and
middle temporal gyrus ­ were found to be active when males solved mental rotation
tasks and females solved spatial working memory tasks. Further, performance was
modulated by activation in the parahippocampal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus for
males and the middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus for females. These
data extend previous claims for sex differences in sex specific spatial cognitive

an evolutionary model, which suggests sexual selection may have favored sex-
differences in such abilities and the neural substrates that sub-serve those processes.

Introduction
Sex differences in spatial cognition are well documented (see Gaulin, 1995 for
review) and appear to have evolved as a consequence of sexual selection for such
neurocognitive capacities (Geary, 1995). Current behavioral (Geary, Gilger, and
Elliott-Miller, 1992; McBurney, Gaulin, Devineni, and Adams, 1997; Moffat,
Hampson, and Hatzipantelis, 1998; O'Laughlin and Brubaker, 1998; Silverman,
Kastuk, Choi, and Phillips, 1999), comparative (Daly and Wilson, 1983; Gaulin,
1992; Gaulin, FitzGerald, and Wartell, 1990; Lacreuse, Herndon, Killiany, Rosene,
and Moss, 1999; Roof and Stein, 1999; Stavnezer et al., 2000), and neuroscientific
(Gur et al., 2000; Jordan, Wustenberg, Heinze, Peters, and Jancke, 2002; Thomsen et
al., 2000) literature has provided convergent support for the development of the sex
difference in spatial abilities (Silverman and Eals, 1992). The evolution of sex
differences in spatial abilities related to navigation may have resulted from one or
more of the following: intra-sexual competition for resources (e.g., access to
members of the opposite sex), direct intra-male competitive mechanisms such as
hunting and / or warfare (Alexander, 1979; Hill, 1982; Symons, 1979), or as a
byproduct of increased home range (Ecuyer-Dab and Robert, 2003; Gaulin, 1992;
Gaulin and FitzGerald, 1989). Local object, or spatial relational working memory (i.e.
indicating the location of a previously viewed object in an array), which is a typically
female dominated task, may have evolved in females for locating food sources and
indicating the location of offspring (Ecuyer-Dab and Robert, 2003; Geary, 1995;
Silverman and Eals, 1992). This conception of the dimorphism of sex-specific spatial
cognition forms the basis for a hunter-gatherer based model for sex differences in
spatial abilities. Here we focus on this hunter-gatherer hypothesis as a theoretical
guidance for our investigation.
Behavioral investigations of sex differences have shown a male advantage
(e.g., quicker reaction time and increased accuracy) on mental rotation (MR) tasks
(see also Geary et al., 1992; Linn and Petersen, 1985; Masters and Sanders, 1993;

McBurney et al., 1997; Silverman, Choi, Mackewn, Fisher, Moro, and Olshansky,
2000; Vandenberg and Kuse, 1978; Voyer, Voyer, and Bryden, 1995). Vandenberg
and Kuse (1978) provided an ecologically valid analysis of spatial abilities by
investigating mental rotation of 3-dimensional objects, which has been replicated, and
is now considered the standard task for measuring mental rotation. Jordan et al.,
showed that task difficulty (i.e. 3-D objects vs. 2-D Letters) correlated with increased
cortical activation in the parietal cortex. Similarly, Shepard (1994) indicated a larger
effect for tasks requiring higher cognitive demand due to their analogous relationship
to real-world 3-dimensional space, or foraging tasks. Therefore, increased parietal
cortex activation in 3D MR tasks may be due to the higher cognitive demand the task
requires (Barnes et al., 2000).
Neuroscientific support for sex differences is provided through
neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies on, typically, male dominated spatial
tasks. Gur et al., (2000) measured hemodynamic response to spatial tasks that varied
in difficulty. They showed a proportional increase in hemodynamic response in the
right parieto-occipital sulcus and left motor cortex as task difficulty increased. Males
showed right lateralized activation in the more difficult spatial tasks and bilateral
activation across all spatial tasks, whereas females showed less activation in both
levels of the task. Due to their findings, Gur et al., (2000) suggested that increased
cerebral blood flow in the right hemisphere of males is correlated with increased
performance on spatial tasks. The male advantage in mental rotation may be a result
of a strategy that entails creating a mental image of the object and turning it in virtual
(egocentric) motor space. Theoretically, this would have been naturally selected for
due to the advantage these abilities would have conferred for males in a hunting
environment enabling them to rotate their personal, or egocentric, space and weapon
in relation to what they were hunting.
It is hypothesized that the neurocognitive capacity needed to effectively rotate
3-diminesional objects in space is related to navigational abilities, and is more
dominantly expressed in males (Geary et al., 1992; Gur et al., 2000; Jordan et al.,
2002; McBurney et al., 1997; O'Laughlin and Brubaker, 1998). Mental rotation
involves mentally representing and manipulating space and objects, and these mental
simulations may serve to guide present and future behavior. The cognitive processes
involved in mental rotation/simulation have yet to be completely elucidated, but it
may be part of a larger network involved in predictive motor cognition or mental
mirroring (e.g., Jackson and Decety, 2004). Motor cognition related to the so-called
mirror neuron system (Gallese, Keysers, and Rizzolatti, 2004; Oztop and Arbib,
2002; Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004) has traditionally been used to explain motor
processes such as reaching and intentional grasping, but it is possible that mirror
neuron systems exist across other neurocognitive modular systems such as audition,
emotion, and possibly also spatial cognition (e.g., Oztop, Wolpert, and Kawato,
2004). A spatial mirroring system might allow an individual the capacity to mentally
model an object, the self, and self-relational perspective to that object in space. If
spatial cognition were related to these processes we would expect to find activation in

pre- and supplementary motor areas, midline cortical structures such as the medial
frontal lobes and precuneus, and the inferior parietal lobes (Decety and Sommerville,
2003; Jackson and Decety, 2004; Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004). Because of the
possible role of mental simulation in hunting and competition, it appears that sexual
selection may have also been a driving force toward the sexual dimorphism in spatial
cognition and appears to have enabled males to maintain a benefit/advantage in tasks
that drew on the capacity to mentally rotate objects in space.
While males excel at navigational and rotational spatial tasks, females show
an advantage in spatial abilities relating to memory for object locations and spatial
working memory (Duff and Hampson, 2001; Eals and Silverman, 1994; Silverman
and Eals, 1992). For example, females make fewer errors and take less time to
complete tasks that tap object location memory (OBL) (James and Kimura, 1997;
McBurney et al., 1997; Tottenham, Saucier, Elias, and Gutwin, 2003) and spatial
working memory (SWM) (Duff and Hampson, 2001a). Alexander et al., (2002)
expanded the research on this task by discovering that female performance was
enhanced when objects were placed in the right hemispace, suggesting left
hemisphere dominance for this type of processing. The hemispheric asymmetry when
solving these spatial tasks, therefore, may be related to remembering the location of
objects or the relational locations of objects (Alexander et al., 2002). Previous
research has indicated a role for "serial processing" or spatial working memory for
spatial task completion in women (Duff and Hampson, 2001a). Further investigation
of spatial working memory indicates that the inferior frontal gyrus is implicated in
working memory and short-term episodic memory. According to the Hemispheric
Encoding-Retrieval Asymmetry (HE/RA) (Nyberg, Cabeza, and Tulving, 1998)
model - the left frontal lobe should be implicated in encoding and right frontal lobe in
retrieving spatial episodic information, as well (Jordan et al., 2002).
Further support of this female strategy was observed by Gur et al. (2000) who
found that only men show a right hemispheric shift in activation for MR spatial tasks.
Even though the task used was male-dominated, this suggests that females continue to
use the left hemisphere to solve spatial tasks ranging in time and difficulty. Males and
females, therefore, appear to implement different cognitive strategies, originating in
different neural substrates when solving spatial cognitive tasks (Jordan et al., 2002).
The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the behavioral
differences in sex-specific spatial cognition correlated with differences in
neurocognitive activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
conducted two studies ­ one behavioral and one functional neuroimaging. We
hypothesized that 1) consistent with existing studies (Geary et al., 1992; Gur et al.,
2000; Jordan et al., 2002; McBurney et al., 1997; Moffat et al., 1998; O'Laughlin and
Brubaker, 1998; Silverman et al., 1999), males would outperform females on a 3-
dimensional mental rotation task and 2) males would show greater neural activation
when solving mental rotation tasks. We also hypothesized 3) that women would
outperform males on a SWM task and that 4) a sex difference in neural activation
associated with solving the SWM task would be observed, with females showing

significantly more left hemisphere activation. Also because we expected females to
show a behavioral advantage in SWM tasks we predicted that (5) females would
show left hemisphere activation while encoding stimuli and right hemisphere
activation while retrieving spatial information, consistent with the HE/RA hypothesis
(Nyberg, Cabeza, and Tulving, 1998).
Experiment 1: Behavioral sex differences in mental rotation and object location
memory
Subjects
Sixty-seven (35 males, 32 females; Mean age=20.67; 62 right handed, 5 left
handed) Drexel University undergraduate students volunteered to participate in the
study for course extra credit. All subjects provided written informed consent in
compliance with the University's Institutional Review Board. Subjects participated in
two tasks - mental rotation and spatial working memory.
Stimuli and Procedures
Because the goal of this study was to compare sexes on sex-specific spatial
cognitive tasks, we made every effort to create stimuli that were as similar as possible
in color, cognitive demand, and experimental instructions and procedures. For
example, all stimuli were presented as white on a black background and subjects were
instructed to respond using same ­ different discriminations in both experiments. All
stimuli (MR and SWM) were presented using Neurobehavioral Systems Presentation
version .71 experimental design software (www.neurobs.com).
Mental Rotation (MR)
Standard abstract 3-D block design mental rotation stimuli (Shepard and
Metzler, 1971) were adapted for this study. Stimuli were scanned into a computer,
enlarged, resolution-corrected, and color inverted using Adobe Photoshop Elements.
Three classes of experimental stimuli were then constructed and presented in three
conditions: 1) spatial: block designs were the same but rotated out of phase (blocks
were rotated either 90 or 180 degrees out of phase; see Figure 1a); 2) same: blocks
were the same but not rotated (see Figure 1b); and 3) different: two different blocks
were presented so that rotation could not produce the same stimuli side by side (see
Figure 1c). Subjects were asked to make same-different judgments using the
computer mouse. Order of stimuli and button used for same/different was
randomized between subjects.

to respond by making same ­ different discriminations to three conditions: (a) spatial

condition, (b) same condition, and (c) different condition.

Spatial Working Memory (SWM)
Stimuli were created from modified versions of what was described in Duff
and Hampson (2001b). Participants were presented with a "study" stimulus for 20
seconds that resembled the game "concentration". The study stimulus consisted of 8
"cards" that presented 4 pairs of object configurations (see Figure 2a). Subjects were
instructed to try and remember the location of the pairs of objects. Immediately after
presentation of the study stimulus subjects had their memory for pairs tested.
Subjects were presented with an array of 8 white cards two of which had "X" printed
on them (see Figure 2b). Subjects were asked to make same ­ different judgments as
to whether those cards with X's on them had the same (or different) objects on the
other side. Subjects were presented with 8 test stimuli four of which were correct and
4 of which were incorrect; correct and incorrect cards were presented randomly.
After responding to all 8 test stimuli, a new study stimulus was presented (20sec) and
followed by 8 new test stimuli. We used five study-test pairs of stimuli. Order of
study-test stimuli was randomized between subjects.
Results
Mental Rotation
Twelve subjects' (7 males and 5 females) data were not included in our
analyses because of technical difficulties experienced with data collection software
and response collection device, which resulted in loss of the data being recorded.
Additionally, 6 (3 males, 3 females) subjects who responded incorrectly to every trial of
the same (control) condition were removed for probable inattention or misunderstanding

of the instructions (e.g., key assignment per condition). We, therefore, present
behavioral data for forty-nine (24 females, 25 males) of the 67 originally recruited
subjects.
Males responded correctly (73.6%) significantly more often than females
(68.4%) (Mann-Whitney U, p<.05). No significant difference was found for reaction
time in any condition or collapsed across conditions (all p's >.05).
Spatial Working Memory
No differences in performance or reaction time for the spatial working memory
test were found (all p's > .1)

instructed to study (try to remember) the location of pairs in (a) study condition.
Then subjects were asked to respond making same ­ different discriminations to
stimuli in (b) test condition. Subjects were instructed to choose same when the X's
were placed on positions that previously were associated with the same object
configurations and different when they did not.

Subjects
Twelve (6 male, 6 female; Mean age = 20.67) Drexel University students
volunteered for participation in the fMRI study. Handedness was assessed using a
modified version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). One
subject presented as left-handed. We analyzed his data separately and found no
significant differences from the right-handed subjects therefore we included this
subject in all group analyses.

Stimuli
Stimuli from Experiment 1 were used in Experiment 2. All stimuli were
presented using goggles designed for use in the fMRI environment and same ­
different responses were collected using a response pad designed for use in the fMRI
environment (Resonance Technologies). Stimuli were presented using
Neurobehavioral Systems Presentation version .71 experimental design software
(www.neurobs.com).
fMRI Imaging Parameters:
Images were collected using a Siemens Magnetom Vision 1.5 T scanner with
echoplanar capability (25mT/m, rapid switching gradients). Initially, the scanning
began with collection of a contiguous (no gap, whole brain) 26 slice high-resolution
T1-weighted imaging sequence acquired in the axial plane to locate the positions for
in-plane structural images (matrix size = 256*256; TR (repetition time) = 600 ms; TE
(echo time) = 15 ms; FOV (field-of-view)= 21 cm; NEX (number of excitations) = 1;
and slice thickness = 5mm). Precise localization based standard anatomic markers
(AC-PC Line) were used for all subjects (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). Next,
functional images were acquired with echo planar free induction decay (EPI-FID,
T2* weighted) sequence in the same plane as the structural images (128*128 matrix;
FOV = 21 cm; slice thickness = 5mm; TR = 4 s; and TE = 54 ms minimum). The size
of the imaging voxel was 1.72 mm x 1.72 mm x 5 mm. We collected 109 volumes
per condition (MR or SWM) per subject using an event-related design. Head
movement was limited by placing foam pads within the head coil and by instructing
subjects to lie still throughout the entire experiment. Audio contact with participants
was maintained throughout the duration of the study for safety purposes.
fMRI Experimental Design
The study was designed to measure significant changes in blood oxygenation-
level dependent (BOLD) signal when solving MR and SWM tasks. We ran two
separate series for each experimental condition. Additionally, we investigated
whether there are sex-specific BOLD responses during these tasks. An event-related
design was used (ISI jittered range: 17 seconds). Subjects were instructed to respond
using same ­ different judgments as quickly and as accurately as possible using the
dominant hand in the same fashion as Experiment 1.
Processing and Analysis of fMRI Data
The post-acquisition preprocessing and statistical analysis was performed
using SPM'2 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Department of Cognitive
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 234 -

Neurology, University College of London, UK), run under the Matlab® (The
Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) environment. Images were converted from the
Siemens format into the ANALYZE (AnalyzeDirect, Inc., Lenexa, KY) format
adopted in the SPM package. A 3D automated image registration routine (six-
parameter rigid body, sinc interpolation; second order adjustment for movement) was
applied to the volumes to realign them with the first volume of the first series used as
a spatial reference. All functional and anatomical volumes were then transformed into
the standard anatomical space using the T2 EPI template and the SPM normalization
procedure (Ashburner, Andersson, and Friston, 1999; Ashburner and Friston., 1999).
This procedure uses a sinc interpolation algorithm to account for brain size and
position with a 12 parameter affine transformation, followed by a series of non-linear
basic function transformations seven, eight, and seven nonlinear basis functions for
the x, y, and z directions, respectively, with 12 nonlinear iterations to correct for
morphological differences between the template and given brain volume. Next, all
volumes underwent spatial smoothing by convolution with a Gaussian kernel of 8
cubic mm full width at half maximum (FWHM), to increase the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and account for residual intersession differences.
Subject-level statistical analyses were performed using the general linear
model in SPM2. The conditions and the baseline were modeled using a canonical
hemodynamic response function with time derivative. Contrast maps were obtained
through the following linear contrasts of event stimuli type ­ for the MR session:
spatial vs. same and spatial vs. different; for SWM: study only was modeled as a box-
car function and compared to baseline MR signal, test correct + test incorrect vs.
baseline and test correct vs. test incorrect were modeled as events. Group-level
random effects analyses for main effects were accomplished by entering whole brain
contrasts into one-sample t-tests. Sex differences were investigated by entering
whole brain contrasts into two-samples t-tests. A significance threshold based on a t
value of >3.17 and spatial extent of 8 voxels was applied to the effects of interest and
surviving voxels were retained for further analyses.
Results
Experiment 2a: Behavioral data
One of the fMRI subject's behavioral data was lost due to complications with
the interaction of the response pad and the MRI environment and therefore we present
behavioral data for eleven (5 females, 6 males) of the 12 subjects.
Mental Rotation
Males responded correctly significantly more often (77.9%) than females
(64.2%) (Mann-Whitney U, p<.01). There were no differences in reaction time for any
condition, nor was there any effect for reaction time when collapsing across MR

conditions (all p's >.05). There was also no significant difference between the results in
experiment 1 and those in Experiment 2 (all p's>.05).
Spatial Working Memory
There were no differences in performance or reaction time for the spatial
working memory test (all p's > .1), and no significant differences were found between
the results in experiment 1 and those in Experiment 2 (all p's>.05).
Experiment 2b: fMRI data
All 12 subjects' (6 female, 6 male) data were included in the fMRI analysis.
One-sample t-tests, as implemented in SPM2, were used to identify areas of activation
common between sexes. Two samples t-test were computed to identify significant
voxels/volumes of interest that differed between the sexes.
Mental Rotation
There were three conditions in the MR study: spatial (blocks with a solution),
different (blocks without a solution), and a control condition that consisted of presenting
a pair of the same block configurations. When collapsing across sex, the contrast spatial
vs. same revealed activation in left inferior occipital gyrus, cuneus, and fusiform gyrus,
and right middle occipital gyrus (Table 1).

Spatial Working Memory
The spatial working memory experiment consisted of two parts: study, which
required the subjects to remember the spatial relational positions of objects and test,
which tested subjects' ability to recall the location of paired objects. Collapsing across
sex, the study condition revealed activation only in the right temporal lobe (Table 5).
When contrasting activation of males vs. females, activation in right precuneus, middle
frontal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus, and left precuneus, inferior parietal lobe,
medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and superior parietal lobe was observed (see
Figure 5a and Table 5). Females vs. males revealed significant activation in right
superior temporal gyrus, and left inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and
caudate (see Figure 5a and Table 5).

condition (p<.001, spatial extent = 8 voxels; Red = males; Blue = Females).
In order to examine the activation associated with the test phase of the
experiment we conducted two sets of contrasts: 1) test correct condition + test incorrect
condition vs. baseline (MR null signal) and 2) test correct vs. test incorrect. Collapsing
across sex for the test correct + incorrect vs. baseline revealed no suprathreshold voxels.
However, when comparing between the sexes, male vs. female revealed activation in
right middle frontal gyrus and parietal lobe. Females vs. males revealed activation in
right precuneus, inferior frontal gyrus, cuneus, lingual gyrus, and insula, and left middle
frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate, middle occipital gyrus,
parahippocampal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus (see Figure 5b and Table 6).
When collapsing across sex, test correct vs. incorrect revealed activation in right
supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, middle frontal
gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, precuneus,
and middle temporal gyrus, and left anterior cingulate gyrus, superior temporal gyrus,
middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, superior frontal gyrus, thalamus, and
inferior temporal gyrus (see Table 7). When investigating sex differences, males vs.
females revealed activation in right postcentral gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, fusiform
gyrus, lingual gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, and
inferior temporal gyrus, and left inferior parietal lobe, inferior occipital gyrus, middle

Relationship between activation and performance: Volume of Interest Analysis
In order to further investigate the role of certain substrates in spatial cognition
we built 4mm spherical volumes of interest (VOI) around several regions using SPM2's
VOI tool. We only did this for areas that revealed significant activation in both sexes to
sex-specific spatial tasks (e.g., medial frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, middle
temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus) and correlated the
degree of activation with behavioral performance (number correct). Most of the
correlations reported in this section are not statistically significant, which is probably a
product of low sample size. Therefore, we only report those correlations that showed a
trend toward significance; however, these data should be interpreted with caution.

overall activation in these sub-regions of the parahippocampal gyrus, males show a
positive relationship with performance.

Discussion
This study, designed to measure behavioral and neural correlates of sex
differences in spatial cognition, supports previous research suggesting a male
dominance for mental rotation tasks (Geary et al., 1992; Gur et al., 2000; Jordan et
al., 2002; McBurney et al., 1997; O'Laughlin and Brubaker, 1998). Although we
were not able to replicate a performance difference in spatial working memory, as has
been demonstrated in the literature, these data do extend previous claims for sexually
differentiated performance in spatial cognitive abilities by demonstrating

neurocognitive sex differences. The discovery that males and females appear to
employ left parahippocampal gyrus to solve tasks that are associated with behavioral
advantages (i.e. MR for males and SWM for females) is novel. Interestingly, left
parahippocampal gyrus correlated with increased performance in the mental rotation
task for males, but was inversely correlated for the spatial working memory task in
females. Both males and females also showed significant activation in the right
inferior frontal gyrus when responding to sex-specific spatial tasks. This finding
suggests that each sex may capitalize on retrieval mechanisms for previously encoded
spatial episodic memories, which supports the notion that retrieval of spatial
information is in part related to hemispheric specificity (Jordan et al., 2002). The
exact role each of these regions plays in sex-specific spatial cognition is unknown,
and an obvious avenue for further research.

responses) in the inferior frontal gyri during SWM test correct + incorrect vs. baseline
for males and females. (Blue = females; p<.001, spatial extent = 10 voxels).
For the male dominated spatial task, we found sex differences in behavioural
performance and BOLD response activation associated with mental rotation (see
Figure 9 for summary of activation). When comparing for sex differences, males
showed significantly more cortical activation over the whole brain (p<.001; 8 voxel
cluster; see Figure 1 and Table 1) than females when solving mental rotation (MR)

tasks. Specifically, males revealed more activation in the medial frontal lobes as well
as regions of the right inferior parietal lobe, right inferior frontal gyrus, and left
parahippocampal gyrus. Activation of right inferior parietal lobe and inferior frontal
gyrus, is consistent with previous literature investigating MR (Gur et al., 2000;
Jordan et al., 2002; Thomsen, Hugdahl, Ersland, Barndon, Lundervold, Smievoll,
Roscher, and Sundberg, 2000).
Figure 9. Summary of activation for the Mental Rotation Task
(a) Male Activation (b) Female Activation
Activation in the inferior parietal lobes is the most common finding and
suggests that this area holds specific importance for male spatial cognition. It is
likely that the inferior parietal lobe which allows for mental representation of self
(Jackson and Decety, 2004; Platek, Keenan, Gallup, and Mohamed, 2004) is also
responsible for self-relation (egocentricity) to objects in space that can then be
mentally manipulated (rotated). This process likely works in concert with regions in
the lateral (inferior) and medial frontal lobes (i.e. mirror neuron system and social
cognitive systems) and may be related to the hypothesis of spatial cognition via
egocentric processing (Chan, Peelen, and Downing, 2004; Committeri et al., 2004;
Platek, Loughead et al., in press; Seurinck, Vingerhoets, de Lange, and Achten,
2004). Cortical midline structures, such as the medial frontal gyrus have been
implicated in self-representation in space and time (e.g., Northoff and Bermpohl,
2004; Platek, Thomson, and Gallup, 2004; Platek, Mohamed, and Keenan, in press;
Vogeley et al., 2001). This would suggest that solving spatial cognitive tasks that
deal with mental rotation or navigational skills is related to some type of mental
motor cognition ­ mentally simulating actions.
The relationship between spatial processing, motor cognition and mental state
prediction/representation may represent a specific functional network of neural
substrates that would have conferred an advantage to males in learning and/or
developing navigational skills, thus increasing cognitive efficiency while engaging in
these tasks. In other words, integration of systems that allow for efficient spatial and
motor processing could benefit learning spatial navigational routes, while integration

of mental state predictions and spatial cognition might have aided combat techniques.
Interestingly, we also found activation in the parahippocampal gyrus, a region
that has received little attention in the spatial cognition literature. The
parahippocampal gyrus is, however, tightly linked in a neuroanatomical loop with the
hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, both of which have been implicated in spatial
cognition in animals (Committeri et al., 2004; Deacon and Rawlins, 2005; Geary,
1995; Heilman, Jeong, and Finney, 2004; Jones, Braithwaite, and Healy, 2003;
Lacreuse et al., 1999; Poti, 2004) as well as the inferior parietal lobe, which has been
implicated in spatial cognition in humans (e.g., Jordan et al., 2002). Furthermore, we
found that performance (number correct) in males was correlated greatest with
activity in this region (see Figure 6), even in regions of the parahippocampal gyrus
that females showed more overall activation during MR tasks (see Figure 6). This
suggests that this region may be an integral substrate that allows males to easily
maximize and implement their navigational abilities and may have been subjected to
selective pressures as a result. Investigation of patients with specific lesions to this
area may help identify the extent to which this region is involved in MR.
Figure 10. Summary of activation for the Spatial Working Memory Task: Study
Phase
(a) Female Activation (b) Male Activation
BOLD activation associated with spatial working memory (SWM) was also
found (see Figure 10 and 11 for summary of activation). When comparing for sex
differences, females showed significantly more cortical activation (p<.001; 8 voxel
cluster) over the whole brain when solving SWM tasks. Females revealed
significantly more activation in the areas of the frontal gyrus as well as regions of the
temporal lobe and parahippocampal gyrus. Specifically, females employ left inferior
frontal gyrus while encoding an array in the study condition and show activation in
the right inferior frontal gyrus while retrieving information in the test condition. This
is consistent with literature on short-term episodic memory encoding and retrieval
(Nyberg et al., 1998). However, we also showed left parahippocampal activation
when contrasting females with males on SWM, which is similar to the activation we
found when contrasting males with females on the MR task. One could speculate that

Common Ground for Spatial Cognition?
the left lateralized activation could be due to an internal verbalization strategy,
however the current study does not provide evidence for or against this claim.
Figure 11. Summary of activation for the Spatial Working Memory Task: Test Phase
(a) Female Activation (b) Male Activation
These findings support a hypothesis that males and females use similar
cortical structures when solving sex-specific spatial tasks. Males showed a lateral
shift in cortical activation, similar to that found in MR tasks, for the study condition
of the SWM task: left inferior parietal lobe and medial frontal gyrus. Interestingly,
there is no significant left inferior frontal gyrus activation in males, which females
appear to use during the encoding portion of this task. This suggests that sex
differences in this task might be related to poor encoding ability by males of spatial
object locations, but this hypothesis demands further investigation to clarify this
issue.
The correlation found between performance on SWM tasks and middle
temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus in females suggests that increased activation
in middle temporal gyrus may improve female performance, while activation in the
inferior frontal gyrus may be a measure of cognitive demand. In other words, since
females showed a negative relationship between performance and activation in the
inferior frontal gyrus, perhaps females employ the inferior frontal gyrus only when
they have to work harder to produce a response. This notion is speculative and
demands further research.
When analyzing the data between sexes at a macro level, it appears that
females employ left hemisphere substrates, primarily frontal gyrus activation when
solving both types of spatial tasks ­ MR and SWM. While males, conversely, showed
more activation in right hemisphere substrates, primarily parietal regions (see also
Weiss et al., 2003).
Unique is the discovery that males and females appear to employ a number of
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 249 -
Common Ground for Spatial Cognition?
similar neural substrates, and perhaps cognitive strategies, across mental rotation and
spatial working memory tasks. It is possible that males' disadvantage in solving
spatial working memory tasks (Duff and Hampson, 2001a; Eals and Silverman, 1994;
James and Kimura, 1997; McBurney et al., 1997; Silverman and Eals, 1992;
Tottenham et al., 2003) is due to their strategy and recruitment of specific neural
substrates. They may be "stuck in the parietal lobe," or unable to encode the same
mental object memory template that females may be creating, which appears to be
related to frontal activation. The decreased performance on mental rotation tasks for
females may be due to the lack of lateral shift as indicated by Gur et al. (2000), but
also because of an inability to activate extended areas of the parahippocampal gyrus
(i.e. no significant activation in the inferior parietal lobe or medial frontal gyrus).
This study had several limitations. First, these data should be interpreted with
caution due to our small sample size. Second, the use of more ecologically valid
stimuli in the SWM task (e.g. faces, everyday objects) may have produced the
behavioural sex difference seen in other studies (e.g., Silverman and Eals, 1992). Our
use of a small object matrix size (8 "cards") may have limited our ability to detect sex
differences. The use of larger object matrices, or a number of differing object matrix
sizes may be a more sensitive test of sex differences in spatial working memory and
may allow for systematic psychophysical investigation of spatial working memory.
Future studies would benefit from systematically controlling for object matrix size
and stimuli type. This approach would allow for a better understanding of the
neurocognitive strategies involved in, and the sex differences associated with spatial
working memory. The lack of a behavioural performance difference in the SWM
portion of this study may be explained by this lack of sensitivity. The MR task could
be modified to resemble the SWM task by presenting pairs of 3-D block designs in a
memory task that entails a level of encoding beyond the current implementation of
the task. We were also limited in our power to detect significant activation by
performance effects; an increased sample size in future studies could rectify this
issue. Finally, controlling for egocentric processing/self-referent mental simulation
may help elucidate the role of self-processing in spatial cognition.
In conclusion, we found common activation in sex-specific spatial abilities in
the areas of the parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus,
and medial frontal gyrus. This suggests that males and females may use similar
cortical regions when solving spatial tasks at which they tend to excel. These data,
and the cross-species findings of these areas being involved in spatial cognition,
suggests that these regions may have been a substrate of sexual selection for sex
differences in spatial cognition. In humans, it appears that a neural network that
includes the parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal lobes, parietal lobes, and the
medial frontal lobes has been selected to allow each sex to adequately engage in
spatial cognitive tasks that provided adaptive survival advantages for that sex.
Additionally, males employ a spatial network that may recruit the so-called mirror
neuron system that may create a mental simulation of motor-based
spatial/navigational maps.
