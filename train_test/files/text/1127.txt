Background: Among adolescents, externalizing prob-
lem behavior and substance use disorders are often co-
morbid. Familial influences, including shared genetic risk
factors, may account for part of this comorbidity. Previ-
ously we reported 2 chromosomal regions (3q24-3q25
and 9q34) likely to contain genes that influence sub-
stance dependence vulnerability (DV) in adolescence.
Objectives: To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs)
that influence externalizing problem behavior in adoles-
cence and to determine whether any identified QTL over-
lap chromosomal regions that influence DV.
Design: Regression-based QTL mapping procedures de-
signed for selected sibling pair samples.
Setting: Patient probands were drawn from consecu-
tive admissions to residential and outpatient (milieu-
type) treatment facilities for substance abuse and deli-
quency operated by the University of Colorado; most of
these patients were referred for treatment by juvenile jus-
tice or social service agencies.
Patients: A total of 249 proband-sibling pairs from 191
families were selected for the study. Patient probands were
13 to 19 years of age; siblings of the probands ranged in
age from 12 to 25 years.
Main Outcome Measures: A community-based sample
of 4493 adolescents and young adults was used to de-
fine clinically significant, heritable, age- and sex-
normed indexes of DV, conduct disorder symptoms
(CDS), and a composite index of antisocial substance de-
pendence (DV  CDS). Siblings and parents were geno-
typed for 374 microsatellite markers distributed across
the 22 autosomes (mean intermarker distance,9.2 cen-
timorgans).
Results: For both DV and CDS, there was evidence of
linkage to the same region on chromosome 9q34, as well
as to 3q24-3q25 for DV, and a novel region on chromo-
some 17q12 for CDS. Our composite index (DV  CDS)
yielded the strongest evidence for linkage (logarithm of
odds=2.65) to the chromosome 9q34 region.
Conclusion: These results provide the first evidence of
a potential molecular genetic basis for the comorbidity
between DV and antisocial behavior.

AMONG ADOLESCENTS, CON-
duct disorder (CD) and
substance use disorders
(SUDs) are frequently co-
morbid in both clinical1-7
and general population samples.8-11 A re-
cent meta-analysis of 51 twin and adop-
tion studies suggests that approximately
40% of the variation in adolescent and
adult antisocial behavior can be ac-
counted for by genetic factors,12 and large-
scale twin studies have estimated the heri-
tability of CD at 24% to 74%13 and 70%.14
Family, twin, and adoption studies sug-
gest that genetic variation influences the
risk of abuse and dependence on alcohol
and nicotine,15-25 and studies of illicit drug
abuse and dependence also suggest im-
portant genetic and familial contribu-
tions to risk for the development of illicit
SUDs.26-35
Although the etiologic mechanisms un-
derlyingtheco-occurrenceofCDandSUDs
remainunclear,supportisincreasingforthe
hypothesis that common genetic risks may
explain part of their comorbidity.36-39 More-
over, this common risk may extend to a
broaderarrayofdisinhibitorypsychopatho-
logic features in general.40-53
Because of the strong comorbidity and
the evidence that genetic risks contribute
to both CD and SUDs, we have hypoth-
esized that common genetic influences
may contribute to these disorders. Our
analytical approach requires probands who
are highly selected for our phenotypes of
interest (ie, extreme scoring). We have spe-
cifically recruited a selected sample of ado-

lescent patient probands and their families (including sib-
ling pairs) from consecutive admissions to treatment
programs that specialize in the treatment of adolescents
with SUDs and comorbid antisocial behavioral prob-
lems. In a recent genome-wide search for quantitative trait
loci (QTLs) underlying substance dependence vulner-
ability (DV),54 we reported regions on chromosome 3q24-
3q25 and chromosome 9q34 that may confer risk for sub-
stance dependence. In the same adolescent sample we now
extend this work, searching for chromosomal regions that
may be involved in comorbid SUDs and CD. Specifi-
cally, the gene-mapping goals of the present study were
to identify QTLs that influence adolescent CD and to de-
termine whether there are overlapping chromosomal re-
gions likely to contain genes that influence comorbid risk.
Indication of shared chromosomal regions would pro-
vide the first evidence of a molecular genetic basis for
the comorbidity between these common disorders.
METHODS
ASCERTAINMENT OF CLINICAL AND
COMMUNITY SAMPLES
Details regarding sample ascertainment and inclusion and ex-
clusioncriteriafortheadolescentclinicalandcommunitysamples
have been described previously.54 Patient probands were drawn
fromconsecutiveadmissionstoresidentialandoutpatient(milieu-
type) treatment facilities for substance abuse and deliquency op-
erated by the University of Colorado; most of these patients were
referred for treatment by juvenile justice or social service agen-
cies. The clinical sample included 249 proband-sibling pairs from
191 families. Probands were 13 to 19 years of age (mean±SD age,
15.9±1.3 years) at the time of assessment. The ethnicity distri-
butionwas7.8%AfricanAmerican,36.5%Hispanic,52.1%white,
and 3.6% other. The community sample included 4493 indi-
viduals 12 to 25 years of age (mean±SD age, 15.9±2.1 years)
drawn from the Colorado Twin Registry,55 the Colorado Adop-
tionProject,56 andtheColoradoAdolescentSubstanceAbusefam-
ily study.57 The ethnicity distribution of the community sample
was 81.6% white, 12.1% Hispanic, 2.3% African American, and
4% of mixed or unknown ethnicity. We have previously re-
ported55 that substance use patterns and prevalence rates in the
community sample are comparable to those reported in na-
tional studies.58,59
ASSESSMENT
Participants were administered an extensive battery of cogni-
tive, psychiatric, and sociodemographic assessments that in-
cluded structured diagnostic interviews and self-report ques-
tionnaires in the treatment facilities (probands) or homes
(siblings) as described previously.54 All participants who were
at least 18 years of age gave informed written consent to par-
ticipate. For juveniles, a parent or legal guardian gave written
consent for participation, and assent was obtained from all ju-
veniles. All research protocols and consent forms were ap-
proved by the institutional review boards of the University of
Colorado, Denver (for proband assessment), and the Univer-
sity of Colorado, Boulder (for assessments of all other rela-
tives), and all subjects were paid for participation.
Substance use data were obtained using the Composite In-
ternational Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module
(CIDI-SAM).54,60 Conduct disorder was assessed using the Di-
agnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) for all pa-
tient probands. Conduct disorder for siblings younger than 19
years was assessed using the DISC, whereas siblings 19 years
or older were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Sched-
ule (DIS). Participants recruited between 1993 and 1997 were
assessed with DSM-III-R versions of the DISC61 and DIS.62 Par-
ticipants recruited between 1998 and 2001 were assessed us-
ing DSM-IV versions of the DISC63 and DIS,64 modified for scor-
ing both DSM-III-R and DSM-IV symptoms and diagnoses.

PHENOTYPE DEFINITIONS
We used DSM criterion (symptom) counts to create 3 quantita-
tive phenotypes to assess DV, CD symptoms (CDS), and a com-
positeindexofantisocialsubstancedependence(DVCDS).The
mean number of DSM-IV dependence symptoms (ie, total symp-
tom count across all classes of substances divided by the num-
ber of substances used repeatedly) was used as our index of DV
(see Stallings et al54 for details regarding the validity of this in-
dex), and the total number of DSM-III-R CD symptoms was used
as our quantitative measure of CDS. (DSM-III-R criteria were used
for CDS because DSM-IV versions of the DISC and DIS assess-
ments were unavailable at the outset of the study; the version of
the CIDI-SAM that was used provided DSM-IV symptom counts
for substance dependence.)
Because of marked age trends on these indexes in our com-
munity sample, the measures were age and sex corrected us-
ing standard regression procedures and then standardized within
sex groups to express scores in our selected (clinical) sibling
sample in relation to the population means and variability for
adolescents and young adults. In addition, CDS scores were ob-
tained from the DISC for probands and younger siblings but
from the DIS for older siblings, and 2 versions of the DISC and
DIS assessments were used. To account for any instrument ef-
fects that may not have been corrected for by our age adjust-
ments, interview type was dummy coded and used to obtain
residual CDS scores. (Instrument type accounted for only 1.2%
of the variance in our age- and sex-corrected CDS scores in the
community sample.)
Standardized DV and CDS scores were summed to form a
composite index of antisocial substance dependence
(DVCDS). This index was then subsequently restandard-
ized so that the metric of the composite (sum) index was the
same as for our individual measures of DV and CDS (ie, means
of 0 and SDs of 1 in our community sample).
DNA COLLECTION AND GENOTYPING
The methods used for preparation of genomic DNA and geno-
typing of the 374 microsatellite markers (ABI PRISM LMS2-
MD10 panels; PE Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) have been de-
scribed previously.54 For 47% of the families, genotypes were
available from both parents; 49% included genotypes from 1
parent, and for 4% of the sibships, no parental genotypes were
available. Sibships included 147 pairs, 35 trios, 7 sibships of 4,
and 3 sibships of 5. Sex-averaged marker maps were obtained
from the Marshfield Center for Medical Genetics database (http:
//research.marshfieldclinic.org/genetics), and allele frequen-
cies were estimated from the full sample using Merlin.65 Table 1
gives marker information for each chromosome and means
across the 22 autosomes.

previous communication.54 Genetic analysis indicated 28
individuals in whom paternity and/or full-sibling status was
questioned. In addition, 1 proband did not have complete
CIDI-SAM and DISC assessments, and 11 individuals were
genotyped for less than 50% of the markers. These individuals
were removed from the sample before linkage analysis, result-
ing in a final sample of 249 sibling pairs. Twelve markers were
omitted for low call rates; the mean call rate for the markers
used was approximately 85%. Estimated marker haplotypes
from Merlin indicated no evidence for excessive recombination
events, and few genotypes (0.07%) were flagged as highly
unlikely. Genotypes flagged as unlikely were not concentrated
among certain markers, individuals, or families, and analyses
that removed unlikely genotypes yielded essentially identical
results to full-sample analyses, so these genotypes were
retained. Identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing for all sibpairs was
estimated at 1-centimorgan (cM) intervals (and also at each
marker for single-point analyses) across the genome (auto-
somes) using Merlin.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The regression-based sibpair linkage method that we used was
proposed by Fulker et al68,69 as an extension of the methods origi-
nally developed by Fulker, DeFries, and colleagues70 for the
analysis of selected twin data. The rationale of the DeFries-
Fulker (DF) linkage analysis for selected sibling samples is that
the siblings of selected probands should demonstrate differen-
tial regression toward the population mean on a quantitative
trait commensurate with the proportion of marker alleles they
share IBD with the proband, given that a QTL is linked to a
particular chromosomal marker. The following regression model
was fit to data from 249 proband-sibling pairs:
C=b1
Pb2(
i
)=,
where C is the quantitative score of the proband's sibling, P is
the proband's score, 
i
is the estimated mean proportion of al-
leles shared IBD for the sibling pair at location (i) in the ge-
nome, and  and  are the regression constant and distur-
bance term, respectively. A t test of the significance of the b2
regression coefficient provides a test of linkage, which can be
expressed as an approximate logarithm of odds (LOD) score
(t2/[2natural log of 10]) . We used the DF regression­based
QTL linkage analysis as operationalized in QMS2,71 a series of
integrated SAS macros available at http://ibgwww.colorado.edu
/~lessem/software/qms2.html.
RESULTS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
The percentages of participants who met the criteria for
DSM diagnoses of substance dependence (DSM-IV) and
CD (DSM-III-R) are given in Table 2. Note the greater
prevalence of substance dependence in the clinical pro-
bands and their siblings compared with community ado-
lescents. There is substantial polysubstance use, with more
than half of the clinical probands (56.7%) meeting crite-
ria for 2 or more substance dependence diagnoses. Sib-
lingsoftheclinicalprobandsalsoshowsubstantiallyhigher
rates of substance dependence and dependence on mul-
tiple substances than community adolescents. Rates of CD
are substantially higher among our clinical probands and
their siblings compared with community adolescents.

On average, our clinical probands score 2 to 3 SDs
higher than community adolescents on our measures of
DV, CDS, and DVCDS. Siblings of the probands show
regression to the population mean but score approxi-
mately half an SD higher than community adolescents
on DV and nearly 1 SD higher for CDsx and DVCDS.
Means and SDs in the community sample are 0 and 1,
respectively, because scores were standardized on that
sample. The mean and SD for DV differ slightly from
those values because recruitment of the community
sample is ongoing and the community sample is now
larger (N=4493 vs 3676) than for our previous report.54
For consistency with that investigation, the standardiza-
tion of DV was not recalculated for the larger sample.
Our measures of DV and CDsx correlate substan-
tially (r=0.49) in our community adolescent sample
(Table 2). As expected, this correlation is attenuated in
our highly selected clinical probands. Biometrical analy-
ses of our community twin sample indicate that these
measures are heritable (h2
DV
=0.34; h2
CDsx
=0.38), and the
genetic correlation between them was estimated at
Rg
=0.47.
SINGLE-POINT LINKAGE RESULTS
Table 3 gives the 29 chromosomal markers (several con-
tiguous) where single-point DF regression analyses re-
sulted in a significant t value (P.05). Reported P val-
ues are actual values obtained without adjustment for
multiple testing. At 3 marker locations (3q24-3q25, 9q34,
and 17q12), single-point LOD scores exceeded 2.0 (cor-
responding to t values 3.03 ). Single-point analysis in-
cludes only informative sibling pairs at a given marker
location, so some caution in interpretation is advised given
that the number of informative pairs varies for each analy-
sis. Despite this limitation, an advantage of single-point
results is that they do not depend on a correct marker
map and can be less sensitive to genotyping errors.72
MULTIPOINT RESULTS

is that information from all 249 sibling pairs is used for
each linkage test evaluation.
Multipoint mapping results indicated 3 regions with
LOD scores greater than 1.0, generally corroborating the
single-point results. These findings provide support for
the hypothesis that common genes may explain part of
the comorbidity between DV and CDS. The strongest evi-
dence for linkage (LOD=2.65) was found for our com-
posite index of antisocial substance dependence
(DVCDS), suggesting evidence for a QTL that influ-
ences both DV and CDS on chromosome 9q34 (near
markers D9S1826 and D9S1838). Evidence for QTLs that
primarily influence DV on chromosome 3q24-3q25 (near
markers D3S1279 and D3S1614) and CDS on chromo-
some 17q12 (near marker D17S798) was also found. These

to 75%, and more than 75% alleles shared IBD at each
location. At our 3q24-3q25 peak location, the sibling
means for DV, CDS, and DVCDS show approxi-
mately half an SD difference between sibpairs with an es-
timated IBD of less than 25% compared with sibling pairs
with an estimated IBD of greater than 75%. For our 9q34
location, the mean difference among these groups for DV
is of similar magnitude, whereas mean differences for CDS
and DVCDS are approximately 80% of an SD. As ex-
pected from our regression results, mean differences are
lower in magnitude at our 17q12 location. The pattern
of means at the 3q24-3q25 location suggests the possi-
bility of a nonadditive QTL, whereas the pattern of means
at the 9q34 location is consistent with an additive QTL.
CHECKS ON ANALYTICAL ASSUMPTIONS
Although the regression-based methods we used are ro-
bust to departures from normality, we performed sev-
eral tests on the assumptions of our analyses. Plots of re-
siduals by predicted values (at the 3 maximum LOD score
locations) indicated no obvious heteroscedasticity prob-
lems. Consistent with expectations, approximately 5%
of the absolute values of the standardized residuals ex-
ceeded 2.0 and approximately 1% exceeded 3.0 for each
of these analyses. Sensitivity analyses were also con-
ducted at these locations, systematically dropping each
sibling pair from the analysis (with replacement) and re-
computing regression statistics from the remaining pairs.
Evaluation of regression influence statistics indicated no
particularly influential cases or outliers. Nonetheless, to
minimize any bias introduced by outliers, we identified
the 5% most extreme individuals (2.5% in each direc-
tion), truncated their scores to the value of the most ex-
treme cases in the remaining 95% of the sample,73 and
then reconducted our regression analyses for each phe-

notype at the 3 maximum LOD score locations. The LOD
scores for DV, CDS, and DVCDS at our 9q34 peak lo-
cation increased to 1.98, 1.84, and 2.74, respectively; LOD
scores for the 3 phenotypes at our 3q24-3q25 peak lo-
cation were 1.55, 0.77, and 1.57, respectively; and LOD
scores at the 17q12 peak location were 0.00, 1.25, and
0.28, respectively. Comparisons between these results and
those from the full sample given in Table 4 indicate that
our findings are not simply artifacts that result from the
undue influence of a few outliers.
EMPIRICAL SIGNIFICANCE LEVELS
We used permutation simulations to derive empirical P
values for our obtained results at each of our peak loca-
tions. Empirical null distributions were simulated by ran-
domly permuting IBD estimates with phenotypic scores
for a given sibling pair (maintaining the family struc-
tures, phenotypic scores, and IBD estimates from the real
data set). We then conducted our regression analyses on
5000 random permutations of our data to obtain empiri-
cal P values for the regression test statistics obtained at
each of our maximum LOD score locations (ie, reported
P values are the proportion of times of 5000 simulations
that we observed t values greater than or equal to the maxi-
mum values we obtained at 3q24-3q25, 9q34, and 17q12).
Those P values, given in Table 4, are not substantially
different from those assuming a t distribution, again sug-
gesting that our results are not unduly biased by viola-
tions of the assumptions of our analyses.
QUALITATIVE ANALYSES
To explore these data further, we used a variant of the
affected sibling pair method. We defined affected status
as scoring above a z-score cutoff of 1.96 for each of our
3 phenotypic measures. Sibling pairs were considered con-
cordant extreme-scoring pairs if they both scored above
the respective z-score cutoff. When only the proband ex-
ceeded the threshold and the sibling did not, the pair was
considered a discordant pair. A z score greater than 1.96
would include approximately 2.5% of the general popu-
lation. By defining affection status this way, we are not
suggesting that many of our sibling pairs are unaffected.
This analysis was used to determine whether sibling pairs
concordant for extreme scores on our quantitative phe-
notypes also showed increased allele sharing IBD at the
locations suggested by our regression analyses.
Table 6 gives the estimated proportion of alleles
shared IBD for siblings defined as concordant high scor-
ing and discordant pairs for our peak locations and for
the flanking markers proximal to each of the peak loca-
tions. At susceptibility loci, the mean proportion of al-
leles that are IBD is expected to be less than 50% for dis-
cordant pairs and greater than 50% in concordant pairs
(the null expectation for siblings is 50%). In general, there
is a trend for increased allele sharing among extreme-

scoring sibling pairs for our 3q24-3q25 and 9q34 peak
LOD score regions. As expected, this trend is less evi-
dent for our 17q12 location, where only our CDS phe-
notype yielded an LOD score greater than 1.0. A trend
for decreased allele sharing among discordant sibling pairs
was found for all phenotypes at our 9q34 region. This
was not found for our 3q24-3q25 region, again suggest-
ing the possibility of a nonadditive QTL in this region.
COMMENT
This study extends our initial findings of putative QTLs
underlying DV in adolescence54 by performing addi-
tional genome scans for CDS and a composite pheno-
type reflecting antisocial substance dependence
(DVCDS) on the same adolescent sample. Our find-
ings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that
common genes may influence CD and substance depen-
dence vulnerability in adolescence. Single-point analy-
ses indicated 29 markers with nominally significant
(P.05) test results for linkage for 1 or more of our mea-
sures. Multipoint mapping analyses corroborated 3 lo-
cations, with the strongest evidence for QTLs influenc-
ing CD and DV detected on chromosome 9q34 (near
markers D9S1826 and D9S1838). A QTL more strongly
associated with DV was detected on chromosome 3q24-
3q25 (near markers D3S1279 and D3S1614), and a pu-
tative QTL unique to CDS was reported on chromo-
some 17q12 (near marker D17S798).
Our maximum LOD score in the region of 9q34 meets
criteria for suggestive linkage (LOD=2.65). The evi-
dence for linkage to 3q24-3q25 and 17q12 is less strong
but of sufficient magnitude to warrant further study of
these regions. Although these locations do not meet the
criteria of Lander and Kruglyak74 for significant linkage,
few studies of comparable sample size will individually
have sufficient power to identify QTLs at this level of sig-
nificance. A strength of our design was the use of a sample
of 249 selected sibling pairs, which provides roughly the
same power as 1000 to 2000 unselected sibling pairs,69
using our analytical methods. Even so, the power to de-
tect QTLs of low effect size (15% heritability) is lim-
ited. Clearly, these findings require replication in inde-
pendent adolescent samples. However, a series of checks
on our current analyses indicate that our linkage results
are robust to outliers and the phenotypic distributional
properties of our sample.
Other investigators have suggested QTLs in the vicin-
ity of ours for substance-related behaviors. Uhl et al,75 in-
vestigating QTLs for polysubstance abuse vulnerability in
an adult sample, reported a significant association with a
region on chromosome 3 within 10 cM of our peak loca-
tion (173-175 cM). Long et al76 also reported suggestive
evidence for linkage to 3 markers on chromosome 3, span-
ning the region 165.3 to 181.1 cM in a genome scan for
genetic linkage to alcohol dependence. Bergen et al77 re-
ported a similar region associated with smoking status on
chromosome 3 (171.7 cM) and a region close to our peak
locationonchromosome9(161cM).Arecentgenomescan
for QTLs associated with CD78 did not find the same lo-
cations as we did for our CDS measure. The authors did
report a QTL on chromosome 3 (134 cM) near a second-
ary peak (LOD=0.80) evident from our genome scan for
our DV measure (Figure 2). However, their adult sample
was selected for high-density alcoholism, and CD symp-
toms were retrospectively reported. In addition, their
samplewasnothighlyselectedforCD(approximately13%
would meet criteria for a diagnosis), so our samples are
not directly comparable.
There are several limitations of our study. First, endo-
phenotypes that uniquely represent specific genetic con-
tributions to CDS and DV are unknown. Our phenotypes
were constructed from standard psychiatric symptom clus-
ters(DSMcriteria).Theseclusters,althoughusefulforguid-
ing currently available treatments, generally do not con-
sider differences in etiologies.
Second, because CD and SUDs develop over time, we
used age- and sex-normed quantitative phenotypes to ex-
press CD and DV in our selected sibling sample in rela-
tion to the population means and variability for commu-
nity adolescents. Although CD and polysubstance use are
characteristic of our high-risk probands and their sib-
lings, not all of our study participants have fully passed
through the age of risk, and this may limit the validity
of our phenotypes.
Finally, our clinical adolescent sample was selected for
both problem substance use and CD; thus, our findings
may not generalize to broader substance-abusing popu-
lations without comorbid antisocial behavior. However,
joint selection for both of these phenotypes would not be
expected to lead to the finding of a common QTL in the
absence of pleiotropy or strong linkage disequilibrium.
To explore our results further, we conducted a search
for candidate genes within ±5 megabases (Mb) of each
of our peak locations79 (http://genome.ucsc.edu). These
searches yielded approximately 100 genes within each
region. We highlight herein some candidates of interest
(a full listing of identified genes in these regions can be
found on our Web site at http://ibgwww.colorado.edu
/cadd/a_center/research). Potential candidates in the re-
gion of 3q24-3q25 include the phospholipase D1 gene
(PLD1); a serine proteinase inhibitor gene (SERPINI1);
claudin 11, an oligodendrocyte transmembrane protein
gene (CLDN11); and neuroligin 1 (NLGN1). A notable
candidate near our 9q34 region is the dopamine -hy-
droxylase gene (DBH). However, when we added a SNP
marker within the DBH gene (DBH-1021CT80) to our
chromosome 9 map, there was no evidence of linkage near
this marker, suggesting that our putative QTL is distal
to the DBH locus. Other potential candidates in the re-
gion include GRIN1 (NMDAR1), a gene that codes for a
subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; a neuro-
blastoma protein gene (AMY); a chloride intracellular
channel gene (CLIC3); and a calcium channel gene
(CACNA1B). Candidates within ±5 Mb of our 17q12 peak
location include the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4);
a cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit (CDK5R1)
that codes for a protein that is a neuron-specific activa-
tor of CDK5; and OMG, a gene that codes for an oligo-
dendrocyte myelin glycoprotein. Although we re-
stricted our systematic search to ±5 Mb, we note with
interest that DARPP-32,81 a dopamine- and cyclic aden-
osine monophosphate­regulated phosphoprotein that ap-

pears to be essential for dopaminergic and serotonergic
neurotransmission, is located 6.3 Mb from our chromo-
some 17 peak. Putative gene function was ascertained from
the GeneCards82 database (http://bioinfo1.weizmann.ac
.il/genecards/).
In summary, CD and SUDs are frequently comorbid
in adolescence.1-3,6-11 Although the precise etiologic mecha-
nisms that underlie the frequent co-occurrence of these
problem behaviors remain unclear, the current investi-
gation was motivated by increasing evidence that com-
mon genetic risks may explain part of the comorbidi-
ty.36,37,39-51 The goal of our current program of research
is to extend this biometrical evidence to localize chro-
mosomal regions that contain genes that influence both
these disorders. Results of this study provide the first evi-
dence of a potential molecular genetic basis for the co-
morbidity between drug dependence vulnerability and
antisocial behavior in adolescents.
