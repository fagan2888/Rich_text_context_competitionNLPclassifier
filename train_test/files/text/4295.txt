Introduction
Dementia is acknowledged as a significant disability that
requires considerable long-term care. The World Health
Organization estimates show that in 2010 there were 35.6
million people across the world with some form of dementia,
with the numbers set to double by 2040 (World Health
Organization, 2012). A large proportion of people with
dementia receive in-home support from family carers. Caring
for a person with dementia can result in physical, psycho-
logical, and economic impacts on the carer, which are often
greater than in caring for people with other conditions asso-
ciated with aging (Barnett, 2013; Brodaty & Donkin, 2009).
These impacts are primarily related to a number of symp-
toms resulting from memory loss, challenging behaviors,
and gradual loss of ability to carry out activities of everyday
living, which necessitate intense support from carers.
The most recent data from Australia estimate that more
than 332,000 Australians are living with dementia (of a total
population of just more than 21.5 million people) with the
numbers set to rise significantly in the next two decades
(Alzheimer's Australia, 2014). Across Australia, it is esti-
mated that 70% of people with dementia continue to live in
the community (rather than in residential care) and the vast
majority (92%) receive informal care and support from one
or more people (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
[AIHW], 2012).
In their recent review, Rummery and Fine (2012) identi-
fied three interconnected facets of care, each of which have
implications for the family care of people with dementia:
The first facet they identified was care as a disposition
toward another as both a cognitive and emotional orienta-
tion. This orientation incorporates taking an interest in the
life of the person along with a degree of responsibility for
their well-being. The second facet was care as a form of
labor, foregrounding such issues as workload, physical
demands, and the costs of care. The third facet was care as a
social relationship, through which both the care recipient and
caregiver may lose autonomy due to the acceptance of depen-
dency and responsibility. The sustainability of the work, or
labor, of informal care is often assessed as "perseverance
time," or the time that an informal carer anticipates he or she
can continue to care under their current conditions (Kraijo,
Brouwer, de Leeuw, Schrijvers, & van Exel, 2011, p. 114).
There is acknowledgment of a need for researchers to con-
sider, in some breadth, the emotional and physical demands
on informal carers who are supporting a family member with
dementia to continue to live in the community (Bjornsdottir,
2009; Cash, Hodgkin, & Warburton, 2013). The research

Carers' Perspectives on Sustainability of
Informal Care for People With Dementia
Prabhjot Singh1, Rafat Hussain2,3, Adeel Khan3, Lyn Irwin4, and
Ros Foskey3
Abstract
The majority of people with dementia, even at advanced stages, receive most of their care and support from family members,
friends, and neighbors, rather than formal support systems. This qualitative research undertaken in the Australian state of
Queensland explored how family carers of people with dementia living in the community successfully manage and sustain
informal caring. It also considers challenges these carers anticipated in continuing to support their family member with
dementia in the future. What emerges through this analysis of the carers' perspective on the sustainability of care is the
impact of factors including the living arrangements, generational cohort and life stage of the carer, financial issues, and ability
to effectively combine caring with their other roles and responsibilities in life.

profiled in this article investigates the lived experiences and
expectations of family carers inAustralia on the sustainability
of the care they provide to allow their family member with
dementia to continue to live in the community.
At least 200,000 Australians are actively involved in pro-
viding informal assistance to people with dementia living in
the community, of whom two thirds are co-resident carers, or
living in the same household as the recipient of care (AIHW,
2012). Sixty-five percent of all informal carers of people
with dementia are women, and 71% of primary co-resident
carers are women (AIHW, 2012). It is estimated that 81% of
the primary co-resident carers and 42% of non-resident
informal carers of people with dementia living in the com-
munity provide 40 or more hours of care per week (AIHW,
2012). However, the impact of informal caring on the co-
resident carer cannot be predicted only through measuring
the amount of time the primary carer spends caring (Grose,
Frost, Richardson, & Skirton, 2013). This is because a key
factor that often distinguishes informal family care and for-
mal care provision is the degree of "emotion work" that is
involved (Chappell & Funk, 2011, p. 358). Hochschild
(2012) distinguished between the management of emotion
that occurs among family and friends in the private-self
sphere, which she labeled "emotion work," and the commod-
ified or marketized form of care that occurs in the public
sphere, which she labeled "emotional labour." Informal care
necessitates emotion work whenever there is a gap between
the implicit social rules and expectations about emotions and
the array of emotions experienced in the caring relationships
(Hochschild, 2012). In these circumstances, it is important to
acknowledge that there are both positive and negative aspects
to the experience of becoming a family carer (Brodaty &
Donkin, 2009). Providing informal family care for a person
with dementia is a complex and evolving process.
Previous research, undertaken both in Australia and else-
where in the world, has highlighted how supportive informal
networks of care play a significant part in community-based
care for people with dementia (Beeber & Zimmerman, 2012;
Bjornsdottir, 2009; Edgell, 2012; Fauth et al., 2012;
LaFontaine & Oyebode, 2014; Lloyd & Stirling, 2011;
Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2009; ter Meulen & Wright,
2012). In particular, the demands of caring can have health,
relational, social, and economic implications for the family
carer, which then affect the quality of the support they are
capable of providing for the care recipient (AIHW, 2012;
Australian Human Rights Commission [AHRC], 2013a,
2013b; Bowman, 2011; McDaid, 2009; Orpin, Stirling,
Hetherington, & Robinson, 2014). The study detailed in this
article was a response to the paucity of research on how
informal carers sustain their caring role (Singh 2009). It
reflects the "presupposition that caregivers will be available"
through the dominant cultural, moral, and economic dis-
courses framing aged care policy in Australia (Cash et al.,
2013, p. 668). In this context, as Cash and her colleagues
(2013) highlight, "It is crucial that we do not lose sight of the
human factor" in informal family care (p. 670). The sustain-
ability of informal caregiving is an important issue that
requires an understanding of both how the family carers'
family and non-family roles interrelate over time, and in con-
sidering the physical, emotional, and socioeconomic impact
of these roles.
The study described in this article was a qualitative study,
conducted in the state of Queensland in Australia, and
focused on the carers' perspectives. It examined the broader
question of how family carers of people with dementia living
in the community successfully manage and sustain informal
caring at present, and how they will continue to provide care
in the future, by identifying the challenges associated with
the continuation of their care. It included consideration of
person-specific factors, family dynamics, and also the social,
community, economic, and service environments within
which informal care was being provided. A detailed descrip-
tion and discussion of the mismatch between the needs of
individuals with dementia and the carers' experiences of
interactions with various levels and types of health services
has been described in another article (Singh, Hussain, Khan,
Irwin, & Foskey, 2014).
Method
The study used a qualitative descriptive design with thematic
analysis of family carers' experiences in providing care for
their family members with dementia. This method was cho-
sen as it allowed for an in-depth understanding of the infor-
mal caring experience of family carers of people with
dementia and enabled the experience of carers to be pre-
sented from their own point of view. Full institutional ethics
approval was sought and granted before data collection
commenced.
Recruitment for the study was through advertisements in
local papers, along with distribution of information through
two key non-government bodies in the state: the Alzheimer's
Association and Carers Queensland. The selection of partici-
pants was based primarily on the person's experience of car-
ing for a family member with dementia living at home,
irrespective of the duration, frequency, or status of the carer
relationship. The sampling was based on purposeful and
open sampling techniques as recommended by Strauss and
Corbin (1998) and Barbour (2008). The initial recruitment
phase based on advertisements in local newspapers only
yielded five participants (P1-P5) over several weeks. The
remaining participants were recruited through the two above-
mentioned organizations. The 17 carers who participated in
the in-depth interviews were residents in diverse settings
including metropolitan Brisbane (the state capital and third
largest city inAustralia), regional cities, including Townsville
and Cairns in far north Queensland, as well as rural and
remote communities in southeast Queensland. In addition,
they came from a broad range of backgrounds and experi-
ences of caring. These included different age groups; had
Singh et al. 3
varied employment statuses including full-time work, part-
time work, and no work involvement; and most were pri-
mary co-resident carers. There was some difficulty in
recruiting male carers for interviews. Many cited time con-
straints and others suggested proxy respondents such as
spouse to provide details. This issue is discussed in the
"Limitations" section of the article. No observable differ-
ences were found in the demographic or other caregiving
characteristics of those who volunteered through newspapers
advertisement versus through agencies.
A semi-structured interview guide incorporating key
issues that had emerged from a preliminary literature search
on the sustainability of informal care was designed to allow
participants to describe their experiences in some detail. The
issues explored within the interviews included the family
dynamics of caring, role changes associated with caring, the
carers' approaches to caring and their coping strategies,
along with the experiences of carers in accessing services,
and the future sustainability of their informal care. Eight of
the interviews were conducted face-to-face and nine were
conducted via telephone--including all those with partici-
pants living in the regional cities and rural and remote areas
of the geographically large state of Queensland. The inter-
views were audio-recorded, with prior consent, and tran-
scribed verbatim.
The methodological approach for data analysis included
combining the application of a descriptive thematic frame-
work with the constant comparison method of Grounded
Theory providing the opportunity to better understand the
process involved in informal caring (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).
The interviews were undertaken in stages and transcripts of
original interviews were reviewed to develop a description
coding of the emerging themes. The research question was
also revisited a number of times during the data collection
phase to ensure its relevance, currency, and validity to the
data collected. Although the number of respondents who
agreed to take part in the study was greater than the study
sample of 17 participants, further data collection was stopped
when the interview data began to provide strong support for
the emerging thematic structure.
Once all 17 interviews were transcribed, the interview
transcripts were read several times by the first author as well
as most of the co-authors (R.H., L.I., A.K.) to develop a cod-
ing scheme based on thematic analysis of the data (Boyatzis,
1998). The descriptive analytical framework allowed for an
in-depth understanding of the informal caring experience of
family carers of people with dementia and enabled the expe-
rience of carers to be presented from their own point of view.
This process included identifying repetitive occurrences
strengthening the analysis to assist in confirming the facts
(Boyatzis, 1998), an iterative process providing the flexibil-
ity to revisit the data for the purpose of refining themes
(Barbour, 2008), and a comparison of each situation, while
also treating them as unique (Boyatzis, 1998). To supplement
the descriptive analytical framework, a constant comparison
method with roots embedded in Grounded Theory was also
used in comparing incidents applicable to each category to
understand and give meaning to the themes and codes in a
given caring situation (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).
In the study reported here, 10 of the family carers were
below the age of 65 years and 7 were aged 65 years and
above. All the older family carers (>65 years) were spouses
(n = 7) and the younger carers included spouses (n = 2), sons
(n = 2), daughters (n = 5), and a daughter-in-law (n = 1) of
the care recipients. The research participants included 2
males and 15 females. The majority of the younger carers
were involved in paid outside work either in a full-time or
part-time capacity. All the participants spoke English as their
first language.
Results
In this study, the critical factors that influenced carers in
managing their caring responsibilities emerged as the carer's
background, age (younger or older carer), and relationship of
the carer (spouse or other family member). A number of
themes related to the informal caring environment were also
recurring throughout the interviews: the shifts and changes
carers experienced in taking on the role of a carer, their
approach to caring, family dynamics, financial issues, and
the intersection of work and care (see Figure 1).
Role Changes
The changes associated with taking on a primary caring role
frequently required the family carers to carry out tasks for
the family member they had not previously undertaken. No
matter how small the task or everyday job, this added to the
carer's sense of responsibility, which was already significant
due to the care recipient's loss of normal functions and
change in behaviors. This is illustrated in this example, from
a wife/carer who explained how it was not simply the major
shifts in the relationship, which characterized caring:
I do all the driving even then it is surprising. You get into the car
and you find yourself going somewhere, it is a major change in
the role, which makes it different. I have never put petrol in our
car, it was something that was always there. And the little things,
. . . it is the little things that really get to you, I know I have to do
it. So yes, life has totally changed. (Participant 1, older spouse)
The transformation of the everyday life of the family
carer and care recipient when taking on a caring role had also
involved changes in the living arrangements of the carer or
their care recipient. Some of the younger non-spouse family
carers had opened their own home to their family member
with dementia, bringing them into an extended, multi-gener-
ational household. Other non-spouse carers had come to live
close by the person with dementia, while other family mem-
bers had moved into the home of the person with dementia.
Carers involved in three-generation living arrangements, in
4 SAGE Open
particular, highlighted the impact across generations as
everyone in the family adjusted to the new routines required
of a changed family situation. A son/carer explained this as
follows: "affected, like how my son and I communicate in
the house and do things and how we go out" (Participant 10,
middle-aged son).
A daughter caring for her mother with dementia, while
simultaneously supporting her frail father, provides another
example of the role changes experienced by non-spouse fam-
ily carers. She explained the shifts in family dynamics inher-
ent in taking on the role of primary decision maker in the
family unit:
Figure 1. Contextual themes surrounding the caring environment.
Singh et al. 5
You know, so we said we've got to try and make decisions for
Mum here and if she's distressed and you're not giving any
really good reason why we should put her through this then
maybe we won't and that means we lose my dad's support as
well because we're not doing what he wants us to do. She went
on to explain: I have a level of difficulty ascending to the role of
parenting the parent. I'm not comfortable with it at all.
(Participant 13, middle-aged daughter)
A number of non-spouse carers described such role
changes as a form of role reversal as illustrated in this descrip-
tion by a daughter/carer:
It's like I'm the mum and Mum's the child now. Mum is at a
stage now where she cannot be left alone. She can be left alone,
but can't be left to wander. And she's incapable of making any
decisions for her own safety or anything like that. (Participant
17, middle-aged daughter)
Through this process, the control in the relationship was
gradually shifted from the care-recipient to the family carer,
who justified the significant shift in family dynamics through
referring to safety concerns for the care recipient.
Approach to Caring
What emerged through the analysis process was the impact
of caregiving on the family carers relationships. Each family
carer's approach to caring was influenced by his or her par-
ticular perspective on the caring situation. Many of the carers
explained how they were reaching out to different forms of
support to alleviate the burden of taking on the responsibility
of caring for a family member with dementia. This included
accessing informal support through their existing family and
social networks, and peer support through carer support
groups. For some of these family carers, it had also included
accessing professional support. These primary family carers
indicated how critical immediate and extended family mem-
bers could be to how they experienced their situation, both
practically and emotionally. An older wife/carer explained,
"I got good support in the family. My two sons are both very
supportive, I truly don't know where I would be without
them, particularly the older one" (Participant 1, older spouse).
The younger carers seemed most likely to draw on the sup-
port of friends and other informal networks in negotiating the
emotional work of caring. In this example, a daughter-in-law/
carer begins with her most intimate family ties and gradually
extends her lens to incorporate her friends and workmates as
crucial sources of emotional support:
But me and my husband talk to each other. We are good support.
I think, we get all the, between friends and our families we pretty
much get all the emotional support we need, workmates and
things like that. (Participant 4, middle-aged daughter-in-law)
Those carers who were active within a carer support group
perceived their involvement in the group as being vital in
sustaining their capacity to care.As one wife/carer explained,
"Carers can come to the support groups without feeling that
they're being unfaithful to their husbands or, sneaky, or any-
thing else" (Participant 6, older-aged spouse). Participation
in a carer support group in which they found others shared
similar experiences allowed these carers to explore their
experiences and in doing so assisted in alleviating the burden
of care.
As one wife/carer explained, "I go to a meeting and we
will all have a chat about husbands or wives or sons or
daughters and share about the same problem and come away
with a feeling that was not such a big issue" (Participant 11,
older spouse). Those who had participated in a carer support
group also identified how such group discussions had often
prepared them for situations they may not otherwise have
anticipated.
Despite this informal and peer support, several carers still
identified their need for and/or a willingness to consider
accessing professional counseling services in dealing with the
emotional demands of caring. For example, this younger
wife/carer in response to a question on type of support needed
to sustain her carer's role suggested that she may need to
access professional counseling to manage the increase in
caregiving responsibilities in the future: "So I suppose I think
that, mainly the counseling I think, there be more counseling
available if people wanted to take up the offer you know? I
suppose I think I may want to one day" (Participant 9, middle-
aged spouse).
Family Dynamics and Conflicts
Overall, caring was perceived to be a "whole of family situ-
ation" irrespective of the contribution of individual family
members to caring responsibilities. The accounts of caregiv-
ers illustrated that the impact on relationships extended well
beyond the dyadic relationship of primary family carer and
care recipient to other family relationships such as with their
spouses, children as well as sibling relationships. In the
example below, a daughter-in-law/carer describes the impact
of caring on her marital relationship. She went on to explain
how giving primacy to her mother-in-law's needs had intro-
duced tensions within the marital relationship, which had not
previously existed:
Caring has impacted on our marriage, [for] it can be very
stressful if one of the people you are caring [for] in the couple is
their parent, but it was meant to, we cope quite well with it. And
there are beliefs in the family and she definitely comes first.
(Participant 4, middle-aged daughter-in-law)
In some instances, the care responsibilities affected intra-
generational and intergenerational family interrelationships
beyond the person with dementia. Some of the carers
described the ongoing adjustments required of other family
members to accommodate their responsibilities as the pri-
mary family carer. The younger carers in three-generation
6 SAGE Open
households, in particular, indicated they were concerned at
the impact of their caring responsibilities on the youngest
members of their family network. For example, a daughter/
carer described how the situation affected the family's qual-
ity of life:
Our quality of life is poor, which also affects our families. For
example, when I am asked there is a function here, can you
come I have to say, no sorry I can't come. Can we have a kid's
party here, no we can't have a kid's party here. My son can't
have a kid's party. (Participant 8, middle-aged daughter)
A number of the carers interviewed described how they
had purposely engaged with family members who avoided
any involvement in direct care to assist them in understand-
ing what was involved in caring for a person with dementia.
This was motivated by the belief that if these family mem-
bers better understood the practical and emotional effort
involved in caring for the family member with dementia,
then this would improve the supportive family network
available to them in their role as the primary family carer. In
this example, a daughter/carer describes how she perceived
an offer of informal respite by her brother as offering him
greater insight into the day-to-day demands she experienced
as the primary carer:
My brother has offered, you know like, him and his wife have
offered to even come over here and sleep in our house if my
husband and I wanted to go away. Well I think that will have to
happen in the future. That will give him an insight into what he's
got to look for. (Participant 15, middle-aged daughter)
The family carers interviewed also acknowledged that it
had not been possible to access emotional and other support
from other family members in every situation. They reported
how, in spite of their efforts, some family members explicitly
refused to take part in, or understand, any of the additional
responsibilities associated with caring for a family member
with dementia. In such circumstances, some carers explained
how they felt that they have not had a choice but to take on
the role of a primary carer. This is illustrated by a son/carer
who explained how:
I've got a sister but she doesn't want to go near the responsibility.
Since Mum got sick, she said that you know, she's got her life
and she doesn't want to give anything up. (Participant 14,
middle-aged son)
Several of the carers'descriptions highlight the assump-
tions, within family networks, that the (often already mar-
ginal) circumstances of a particular individual meant he or
she was most available to look after the person with
dementia. In such circumstances, as described by this
rural daughter/carer whose family lived nearby, there was
no guarantee that the primary carer would have access to
family support:
I have six brothers and sisters that live in a big town close by, who
are married and they all have children, or most do. And their
children now have children, and they're mostly in their 30s.
Nobody even offers to help. (Participant 17, middle-aged daughter)
Thus, while family support emerged as vital to the sus-
tainability of care, the interpersonal dynamics within fami-
lies can also mean that such support is not readily accessible,
even where the extended family may live close-by.
Financial Impact of Caregiving
The financial impact of caregiving was an aspect of care
where the carer's attention tended to focus on the medium-
and long-term implications of care, and not simply on imme-
diate concerns. Assistance in financial planning became
more important as the needs of the care recipient changed,
and their condition deteriorated. This was illustrated by a
younger wife/carer who had already sought financial advice
but felt that access to such advice would need to be ongoing
to enable her to sustain her caring responsibilities:
Even though we own our own home etcetera, because we're
only in our 50s I have to allow probably for a normal life span of
70 say you know, so I have to work out to that time, and what is
the best way to go about it, I don't know . . . it's like everything,
you can go once but then you need to continue, think about it
until things change and that sort of thing, so therefore your need
to follow up with ongoing assistance on these things. (Participant
9, middle-aged spouse)
Almost two thirds of carers interviewed in this study
received some financial assistance from the Australian
Government, in the form of a Carer payment and Care allow-
ance. They explained that although this assistance was help-
ful, they found it was insufficient to meet the additional and
ongoing demands of their caring situation. Carers described
how they had incurred out-of-pocket expenses to meet the
basic needs of the care recipient, noting how this added extra
financial stress on their caring situation. Carers also high-
lighted the difficulties they had experienced in communicat-
ing their financial situation to service providers. They noted,
in particular, a lack of flexibility by service providers in
responding to their particular needs and circumstances.
In particular, younger carers described the financial diffi-
culties they were experiencing as a result of the impact of
their caring responsibilities on their employment. Financial
stress, combined with the physical and emotional burden
associated with caring for a family member with dementia,
affected these carer's perceptions of their ability and capac-
ity to manage and sustain their caring role into the future.
This perception is evident in this description by a daughter/
carer:
It's just like to me that the government wants us to stay home
and look after people that need looking after, and which I want
Singh et al. 7
to do, but I believe they have to help more and stop penalizing
us for caring. (Participant 17, middle-aged daughter)
In contrast, for carers with access to greater financial
resources, this made it easier not only for the carer to cope
financially but also freed them up emotionally and psychologi-
cally to attend to the other demands of their caring situation.
Challenges in Intersection of Work and Care
In this study, several carers described their attempts to bal-
ance their caring situation with continuing their work
arrangements. Working lives were cut short by the demands
of caring for a family member with dementia leading to their
early retirement.
As a wife/carer explained,
. . . when he was diagnosed, and, when he gave up work and I
gave up work at the same time, but then I was coming 60 so
there it goes, you know, I mean, and then I'd like to be working
now, but anyway . . . (Participant 5, older spouse)
Other carers were not able to negotiate an effective bal-
ance between their caring responsibilities and paid work due
to the lack of flexibility on the part of their employer. In this
example, a daughter/carer explained how the unpredictable
nature of informal caring in dementia, and lack of flexibility
in formal respite care services, had resulted in her loss of
employment. She explained,
But because all the respite centers were shut I had no one to look
after mum, so I couldn't go to work, and I do believe that
impacted and I do believe that that's one of the one of the reasons
that they fired me. Because I couldn't attend work because I
couldn't attend work, because I had to look after mum.
(Participant 17, middle-aged daughter)
These carers explained how they had experienced a total change
in their lives due to their caring responsibilities, which meant
that their lives rotated around what the care recipient could, and
could not, do. Caring felt to them as if it were more than a full-
time job. Other carers who continued in paid employment antic-
ipated that a choice would have to be made at some point
between continuing to work and their dementia caring responsi-
bilities.As a daughter-in-law/carer explained, "To look after her
fully, eventually one of us will have to stop working or work
part-time" (Participant 4, middle-aged daughter-in-law).
The impact on younger carers' lives, in particular, was
significant for they had to make more adjustments to their
lives to manage other commitments such as work, while
meeting their caring obligations. In some cases, taking on a
caring role reduced employment options, as a daughter-in-
law/carer explained: "My mother-in-law is only 55 and we
have moved interstate to care for her and because we live in
a semi-remote location, there is not a lot of work" (Participant
4, middle-aged daughter-in-law).
The younger carers who were no longer in paid employ-
ment were particularly concerned about their ability to re-
enter the workforce when their caring arrangement came to
an end. Their concerns included deskilling and/or losing con-
fidence about their ability to meet job requirements. This was
compounded where additional barriers were anticipated in
seeking to re-enter the workforce at an older age.As one older
wife/carer who had previously been self-employed explained,
I work for myself but in the end I just had to stop it completely.
Now when I try to get back into the workforce, I think the years
of being out of the workforce really has had a negative impact
on that. (Participant 16, older-aged spouse)
A daughter/carer, who had dual caring responsibilities, for
both a child with a disability and a parent with vascular
dementia, explained how it was the unpredictable demands
of caring for her mother that led to her decision to delay her
long-planned return to paid work:
Round about this time last year it became obvious that my son who
has a learning disability was starting to get it together and I was no
longer required to care for him to that extent, and we talked about
me returning to work and about our financial commitment. And
almost within days my mum had another little stroke and things
happened that made me realize that it was not possible again that
though I might be able to work this week, next week something
could go wrong. (Participant 8, middle-aged daughter)
As indicated in the "Method" section of this article, some
of the participants recruited into the study lived in rural and
regional areas of the state of Queensland. The effect of resi-
dential location in relation to caregiving was reported to be
associated primarily with lack of access to appropriate com-
munity-based aged-care and specialized health services for
family member with dementia as well as adequate and timely
information for the carers. These issues are reported and dis-
cussed in a previous publication (Singh et al., 2014). In rela-
tion to the findings of the current article, the key issue of
rural and regional location was the lack of options for appro-
priate and relevant employment in the formal sector.
What emerges from the findings presented in this article is
that the burden of caring for a family member with dementia has
the potential to have long-term effects, not only on access to
employment but also on the quality of life of the family carer.
Some carers felt they were being forced to choose between con-
tinuing with paid work and long-term financial viability and sus-
taining their care of a family member with dementia. Assessing
the sustainability of care includes the long-term implications for
the carers and, in three-generation caring arrangements, their
immediate family's economic sustainability.
Discussion
Sustainability of informal caregiving is an important issue
that requires an understanding of how the family carers'
8 SAGE Open
family and non-family roles interrelate over time.
Sustainability as a concept refers to viability of informal care
and the impact of delivery of long-term care at the commu-
nity level on carers (Knapp, Challis, Fernandez, & Netten,
2004). Medves and Davies (2005) argue that sustainability in
the health arena should focus on building the capacity of
families as the core of the community so that they can
respond to and manage their caring situation and be able to
develop responses to broader issues affecting them.
This research has helped highlight how taking on a caring
role involves many changes in the lives of family carers of
people with dementia. It is important to acknowledge that car-
ing for a family member with dementia combines "emotion
and labour and relationship" (Rummery & Fine, 2012, p. 329,
italics in original). The focus in research and practice on
informal dementia care has often remained on the dyad of
carer and care recipient, which can lead to a tendency to con-
figure such changes as inherently private and individual. For
example, other researchers have found that it is those family
carers with a belief in their abilities and a sense of compe-
tence, who may be least vulnerable to the stress associated
with the burden of caring for a family member with dementia
(Contador, Fernández-Calvo, Palenzuela, Miguéis, & Ramos,
2012). This study helps highlight the importance of not only
family support but also social support and financial security
to the sustainability of family care.
The first facet of care identified by Rummery and Fine
(2012) was care of another as a disposition encompassing
both emotional and cognitive orientations. As this study
illustrates, carers are seeking to comply with "the feeling
rules of being a good caregiver" (Simpson & Acton, 2013, p.
52), but this can lead to emotional dissonance where this
comes into conflict with other feelings and beliefs. Caring
responsibilities result in extensive change to family relation-
ships beyond the dyad of carer and care recipient, most
apparent in the current study in circumstances where caring
incorporated three-generation co-residence households. In
such circumstances, the carer needed to negotiate complex,
and often competing, role demands alongside "the experi-
ence of changing and contradictory identifications of home"
(Edgell, Bond, Brittain, & Jarvis, 2010, p. 105). This is illus-
trated, for example, where the daughter carer described being
unable to meet her young son's request to invite his friends to
a birthday party held at home, and other events because her
mother's needs took precedence.
The second facet of care identified by Rummery and Fine
(2012) was care as a form of labor. In this study, the social
and economic arrangements of family carer's lives also
emerge as multiple and complex. Carers can experience
emotional dissonance as they seek to comply with the nor-
mative assumption that their private caring responsibilities
can be kept separate from their other roles and responsibili-
ties in both the private and public spheres of their life. In the
current study, the caring process emerged as being complex
and iterative, rather than predictable and linear. Carers have
uneven access to support networks, and also differ in how are
they are able to mobilize family, friends, and other systems
for practical and emotional support and labor (Edgell et al.,
2010). Poor family functioning, in particular, can increase
the stress and strain on the family carers of people with
dementia (Heru, Ryan, & Iqbal, 2004).
As mentioned in the introductory section of the article, the
sustainability of the work, or labor, of informal care is often
assessed as "perseverance time," or the time that an informal
carer anticipates he or she can continue to care under his or
her current conditions (Kraijo et al., 2011, p. 114). However,
as shown through this study, the demands and changes faced
by family carers cannot be predicted solely by measuring the
amount of time the carer spends caring for the person with
dementia. Carers are constantly negotiating competing, and
conflicting, time demands as they allow and take the time to
care (Keating & Dosman, 2009). The strain this causes leads
to emotional dissonance as the carer struggles to negotiate
and adapt to the different feeling rules and competing time
orders of the various aspects of their lives including those of
family, medical and care systems, government bureaucracy,
and the workplace.
The inherent tensions between the cyclical, organic, and
temporal character of caring for a family member with
dementia and the "linear, abstracted, unvarying form of
time" (Twigg, 2008, p. 240) that tend to underpin both for-
mal service provision and contemporary employment prac-
tices also emerged in the study. The younger carers, in
particular, were often caring for the family member with
dementia at home while simultaneously negotiating the more
abstract and "instrumental quality of time efficiency" (Twigg,
2008, p. 240) associated with their paid employment.
Tensions then arose as these different time orders inevitably
came into conflict. This conflict had significant implications
when, for example, a daughter/carer attributed her loss of
employment to the inflexibility of the formal care system
that had meant she was unable to access respite care at short
notice.
Several carers described feeling forced to choose between
differing forms of labor, that is, the labor associated with
continuing to care for their family member with dementia
and the labor associated with either seeking employment or
remaining in paid employment: for example, among the
young carers, the loss of employment, delayed return to paid
work, and the reduced employment options of moving to
care for a family member in an area with few employment
opportunities. This echoes the findings of a recent Australian
Human Rights Commission's (AHRC; 2013b) inquiry on
care, which noted the negative impact of the provision of
unpaid care on both informal carers'participation in employ-
ment and on the work hours of those who were employed.
In the current study, it was often the family member who
was already out of the workforce, marginally engaged in the
workforce, perceived as the most mobile, or close to retire-
ment who took on the full-time role of caring for the family
Singh et al. 9
member with dementia. The risk was that this would simply
compound their already marginal social and economic cir-
cumstances when their caring responsibilities came to an end
(AHRC, 2013b).
Financial stress has been identified in a range of research
(e.g., Lilly, Robinson, Holtzman, & Bottoff, 2012; Lai, 2012)
as being a significant factor in the burden of care experi-
enced by family carers, a finding reinforced through this
study. Several carers in this study noted that the financial
costs associated with caring for a family member with
dementia not only had implications for the sustainability of
their care but also their own long-term financial viability. As
the Australian Human Relations Commission pointed out,
the financial implications can result in "a significant impact
on the incomes of carers over their life course [as well as
increase the carer's] risk of poor mental health and poverty in
later life" (AHRC, 2013c, p. 2). In these circumstances,
improving the sustainability of care will not be achieved
solely through supporting the carer in the short term.
As other researchers have noted, estimates of cost of
informal care for people with dementia do not usually include
the real cost that includes lost work time and the cost to
social relationships through the intensity of caring responsi-
bilities (Brodaty & Donkin, 2009). This highlights a need to
consider the long-term implications of sustainability of
informal care for the primary carer and their family network
and to consider ways to offer more sensitive and nuanced
support to those who could be vulnerable to poverty and ill-
health once the care responsibilities end.
Rummery and Fine (2012) also focused on care as a social
relationship in which both the caregiver and care recipient
can gradually lose their autonomy. The loss of autonomy by
the carer occurs as being ascribed as the primary carer by the
formal care sector gradually transforms care from a private
good into a "marketized domestic life [which draws] on
complex mixes of both work and family cultures"
(Hochschild, 2012, p. 204). This process can tend to rein-
force the intensely bonded dyadic relationships between
carer and care recipient in ways that can be detrimental to
both the care recipient and carer's other relationships and
hence their quality of life (Kraijo et al., 2011).
The normative expectations underlying formal care and
support services are that a particular family member will be
designated as the primary carer, and take on greater respon-
sibility for the management of the needs of the family mem-
ber with dementia as his or her condition progresses (AIHW,
2012; Välimäki, Vehviläinen-Julkunen, Pietilä, & Koivisto,
2012). Such responsibilities result in fundamental changes in
the relationship as the family carer takes on an increasingly
managerial role in ways that can undermine other aspects of
the relationship (Roberto, McCann, & Blieszner, 2013). This
is illustrated by the younger carers who described the change
in role associated with taking over decision making as a form
of role reversal. Yet, there may be limited negotiation within
the formal health and care system and the family network, as
to who is to be ascribed that responsibility (Välimäki et al.,
2012; Willyard, Miller, Shoemaker, & Addison, 2008). Yet,
paradoxically, as this responsibility is also associated with
negotiating a reduction in their opportunities in other aspects
of their lives, such as continued participation in paid employ-
ment, the carer may be gaining this responsibility while
reducing his or her own autonomy. This is a loss of autonomy
that may well have long-term implications.
In relation to the gendered nature of caregiving, women
still outnumber men in relation to being primary caregivers
with the latest national Disability, Aging, and Carers Survey
indicating that women make up 70% of primary carers and
56% of overall carers (Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS],
2014). This situation may change further as gender roles
become more blurred (McDonnell & Ryan, 2013) as an
ascribed expectation as highlighted by the son carer in the
present study who felt there was little choice but to take on a
primary caring role when his sister refused the responsibility.
In turn, taking on the primary caring role had an impact on
his relationship with his own son. As McDonnell and Ryan
(2013) suggest, there may be a need for greater attention by
researchers to the experiences and issues for male carers in
informal dementia care as more males are designated as the
primary family carer.
The limitations of this research are inherent in the confined
nature of this research with a focus on carers across a single
state of Queensland in Australia. Whereas the approach taken
allowed an in-depth analysis and study of carers'experiences,
the design was limited to a single interview that limits any
longitudinal analysis of caregiving issues. The available
resources were limited and the requirements to complete the
data collection within a 12-month period precluded the pos-
sibility of repeat interviews some months later, and additional
resources for transcription of interview data.
It would be useful if future studies used a longer time
frame to examine in more depth the challenges associated
with caregiving. Another limitation is that the findings might
not be reflective of all the factors affecting the sustainability
of informal care at a national Australian level. This is par-
ticularly so, as the study did not include minority migrant
groups from other cultures, who may have a different set of
issues associated with caregiving as shown by some recent
studies (Benedetti, Cohen, & Taylor, 2013; Boughtwood,
Adams, Shanley, Santalucia, & Kyriazopoulos, 2011). The
vast majority of the carers (88.2%) who volunteered their
participation in the present study were women. Although this
is largely consistent with the caring patterns in Australia, it is
important to acknowledge that the findings from this study
could have been different if more male carers had been
included. As stated earlier, recruitment of male carers was
difficult, and from the available pool of volunteers, there
were only two male participants, both of whom were included
in the study.
Despite these limitations, the present study has provided
many valuable findings, contributing to the discussion on the
10 SAGE Open
sustainability of informal care of people with dementia. It
also suggests that the current view of sustainable care needs
to be broadened to include not only the capacity of a primary
carer to sustain caring at an individual level but also the
impact of care on the family network, and over the long term.
Conclusion
What emerges from this study of family carers of people with
dementia from Queensland, Australia, is the vital importance
of considering the wider social and economic context in
which informal caring relationships occur. The study reported
here has helped illustrate how the shifts and adjustments
required in interpersonal relationships were not restricted to
the dyad of family carer and the family member with demen-
tia but extended to other relationships: family, friends, and
work-related. In seeking to enhance the sustainability of care
for the person with dementia, it is therefore vital that we pay
attention not only to the quality of the care being provided to
the person with dementia by the primary carer but also the
supportive systems in which they are located.
It is important to pay attention to the social, emotional,
and economic well-being of all those involved in caring for
the person in both the short and long term. A failure to pay
attention to the interlinking systems in which care relation-
ships occur undermines more than the immediate sustain-
ability of the informal care being provided to the family
member with dementia. Such failures can affect the family
carer's ability to sustain his or her vital roles as partner,
worker, and community member in the long term. This has
consequences for the family carer's health and well-being,
the quality of his or her relationships, and long-term finan-
cial stability. Such complexity needs to be recognized and
acknowledged in the policy and practice seeking to support
family carers in sustaining their care.
