Objectives. Elderly widows are three times as likely to live in poverty as older married people. This study investigates
the gap in poverty, income, and wealth between these groups. Focus is placed on the role played by out-of-pocket medical
expenditures spent on dying spouses.
Methods. A national panel survey of people age 70 and older in 1993 was used. Income, poverty, wealth, and out-of-
pocket expenditures were examined before and after widowhood, with comparisons made with couples not experiencing
a death.
Results. Forty-four percent of the difference in economic status between widow(er)s and married elderly persons was
due to disparities in economic status that existed prior to widowhood. The remaining 56% was due to factors more directly
related to the death of a spouse, including the loss of income and expenses associated with dying. On average, out-of-
pocket medical expenditures in the final 2 years of life were equal to 30% of the couple's annual income. For couples in
the bottom quarter of the income distribution, these expenditures were 70% of their income.
Discussion. As policy makers continue to debate expansions and reforms of Medicare, the potential effects of these
reforms on economic well-being, particularly among widows, should be considered.
DESPITE the overwhelming success and popularity of
programs such as Social Security and Medicare, some
subgroups of the elderly population continue to face substantial
risks of living in poverty. Whereas the poverty rate for elderly
individuals is now hovering at 10%, the poverty rate for elderly
widows is nearly twice as high. When examining poverty rates
for women in particular, one finds that approximately 5% of
married elderly persons are poor compared with 17% of wid-
ows (Figure 1). Although policy makers have repeatedly
expressed concern about these high rates and enacted legis-
lation attempting to improve the well-being of surviving
spouses, the figure demonstrates that this gap has stubbornly
remained (see endnote 1). Obviously, the more that is known
about the causes and characteristics of poverty among widows,
the better targeted public policy can be.
One possible explanation for these high rates of poverty that
has received little attention is the potential for couples to spend
substantial portions of their wealth on the health care of a sick
or dying spouse. When an ill spouse dies, the survivor may be
left with fewer assets than had been anticipated, putting her at
greater risk of becoming poor. Although this hypothesis has
never been examined directly, recent policy discussions have
reached the near-unanimous consensus that Medicare, the
primary source of health insurance for most elderly citizens, has
important gaps, including, most notably, the failure to cover
extended hospital stays, prescription drugs, and long-term care.
Indeed, the Medicare Modification Act of 2003 partially fills
one of these gaps by providing some prescription drug coverage
beginning in 2006. Although many couples have health
insurance that supplements Medicare, a sizable portion may
be vulnerable to catastrophic expenditures.
Here we investigate this possibility by examining medical
out-of-pocket (MOOP) expenditures for elderly couples in the
period immediately preceding the death of one spouse. Al-
though the first spouse to die is typically the male, we include
both widows and widowers in our study and simplify the
discussion by using the term ``widow'' to refer to both. We first
examine the size of these expenditures on an absolute level and
relative to the couple's income and wealth. We then focus on
the effects of MOOP expenditures on the financial well-being
of the surviving spouse.
Our study proceeds as follows. The first section provides
background information on the explanations for why widow
poverty is so high. This section also describes the Medicare
program and its gaps in coverage. Then the Asset and Health
Dynamics Study that we use for our analysis is described. The
empirical analyses of MOOP expenditures and other factors
affecting the finances of the surviving spouse follow. The final
section summarizes the findings.
PREVIOUS STUDIES
Why are so many widows poor? The death of a spouse will
mean a loss in income if the spouse had been working or per-
haps the loss of a business if he was self-employed. However,
a spouse's death may also result in a loss of many types of
nonlabor income including pensions, annuities, and Social
Security. Certainly, the amount needed to support a single
person is less than that needed to provide for a married couple,
but often the loss in income will be greater than the change in
needs. For example, Social Security benefits for a couple in
which only one spouse worked substantially in the labor force

are typically reduced by one-third when a spouse dies. Among
couples in which both spouses worked and drew on their own
Social Security benefits, benefits would be reduced by an even
greater percentage. At the same time, the reduction in the needs
level, as measured by the poverty line, is just 20%, automat-
ically ``causing'' a number of individuals to be newly classified
as poor. Finally, there may be reductions in financial well-being
if some of the couple's wealth is bequeathed to a child or other
heir or if substantial funeral expenses are involved.
Less obvious is the potential role played by differential
mortality. The strong gradient in mortality risk by income (and
wealth) implies that at any given age, women whose husbands
have died likely had lower income throughout their lives than
women whose husbands are still alive. Holding age constant,
then, widows will be poorer than married women (Holden,
Burkhauser, & Myers, 1986; Weir, Willis, & Sevak, 2000; Zick
& Smith, 1991).
MOOP expenditures near death provide an additional avenue
through which widows may become poor. It is well known that
Medicare expenditures near death are large (Garber, MaCurdy,
& McClellan, 1998): Evidence based on Medicare records points
to medical spending in the last years of life that is approximately
six times larger than medical expenses at other times (Lubitz &
Riley, 1993). However, it remains to be seen whether the out-of-
pocket costs borne by Medicare beneficiaries themselves have a
sharp rise as well. The fact that the Medicare program does not
offer coverage for long-term care, extended hospital stays, pre-
scription drugs (until 2006), and other services might appear to
be a cause for concern. Many elderly persons do have insurance
to supplement Medicare; 33.7% of this population has employer-
sponsored private health insurance, an additional 30.1% of
elderly Medicare participants purchase private insurance, and
the poor are either implicitly or explicitly covered by the
Medicaid program (Liu & Sharma, 2003). Note, however, that
Medigap insurance does not provide coverage for long-term care
and many policies do not cover prescription drugs. Medicaid
does cover all such expenses.
We are not the first to recognize the potential importance of
medical spending in affecting economic well-being. In 1995, a
National Academy of Sciences panel issued a report on poverty,
arguing that health care expenditures should be subtracted from
income when measuring poverty rates (Citro & Michael, 1995).
Because medical costs are high among the elderly, such a
change would be expected to have a substantial effect on esti-
mates of poverty for this group. One study has concluded that
subtracting MOOP expenditures from income would lead to
elderly poverty rates that are twice as high as the current-
income-only approach used by the Census Bureau (Johnson &
Smeeding, 2000).
DATA
The data for our study come from the Asset and Health
Dynamics (AHEAD) cohort of the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS). The HRS is a panel survey of older individuals. The
AHEAD cohort consists of those born in 1923 or before, as well
as their spouses or partners (Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, & Wallace,
1997). When appropriately weighted, the sample is representa-
tive of the noninstitutionalized population in this age group. The
first wave of AHEAD interviews was conducted in 1993 when
respondents were approximately 70 years old or older, and they
have been reinterviewed approximately biennially thereafter.
(The pattern of biennial interviews was altered in 1997 to carry
out a one-time shift to even-numbered years.) Importantly for
this article, when a respondent dies, an ``exit'' interview is
conducted to obtain information about the respondent's life
since the previous wave, including medical expenses up until
the date of death.
We use Wave 1 and Wave 2 of AHEAD and the exit interview
for respondents who died between waves. Of particular impor-
tance are the data on MOOP expenditures. In Wave 1, respon-
dents are asked to report total expenditures on goods and
services (nursing home, hospital and doctor bills, and any other
medical or dental expenses) for the preceding 12 months. Data
on MOOP expenditures in Wave 1 were collected in two
questions: one focusing solely on nursing home expenses and
a second comprehensive question that asked about all other
expenses. We combined these two categories to form total
MOOP expenditures. Depending on the category of expendi-
tures and the wave of the interview, as little as 0.1% and as much
as 20.2% of the sample had missing data on MOOP, with the
highest rates within the exit interview. When the respondent did
not know if there were any such expenses, we imputed the
amount using a two-step procedure. First, we randomly assigned
a value of 0 or 1 to each of the ``don't knows,'' with the prob-
ability of being assigned a value of 1 equal to the share of the
respondents reporting positive MOOP spending among those
who did, in fact, know if MOOP expenditures were incurred.
The ``don't knows'' who were randomly assigned a value of 1
were then assigned a value of MOOP spending equal to the mean
value of MOOP expenditures among those respondents who
reported positive values. Respondents assigned a value of 0
were assigned MOOP spending of 0. Given the skewness of the
distribution, we also experimented with using the median instead
of the mean and found the results to be similar. To this combined
amount, we add expenditures for health insurance premiums
including Medicare Part B premiums (see endnote 2). This total
gives us our measure of what individuals spent for health care.
Hill and Mathiowetz (2000) find that estimates of medical
spending based on the HRS and the Medical Expenditure Panel
Study align well.
For married couples, the Wave 1 survey is less than ideal in
that it does not identify which spouse incurred the costs. To
estimate a per-person expenditure, we simply assign half of the
couple's total expenditures to each spouse. Because we focus

Survey).

on those couples in which a spouse died between Wave 1 and
Wave 2, it is possible that the spouse who died between waves
was ill and had higher health care costs in Wave 1 than did the
surviving spouse. In this case, our approach of evenly dividing
Wave 1 expenses may lead to an underestimate of MOOP ex-
penditures in the last years of life. We have carefully inves-
tigated this issue and believe that this bias is likely to be small.
Because there is no aggregation bias for single respondents, we
investigate the possible severity of this bias by comparing
health care costs in Wave 1 for singles who survive to the
second wave and those who do not. We find that MOOP ex-
penditures are 25% percent larger for singles who die between
waves than for those who survive, $2,503 compared with
$1,995. In comparison, the difference in our constructed MOOP
expenditures in Wave 1 for married couples who experienced
a death and those who did not was, again, approximately 25%
percent, $2,787 versus $2,211, on a per- spouse basis, sug-
gesting that the equal division of Wave 1 expenditures did not
result in misleading conclusions.
At the exit interview, proxy respondents were asked to report
MOOP expenditures for the decedent between the time of the
Wave 1 interview and the time the person died. In the exit in-
terview, expenditures were reported solely for the deceased
respondent (and not for the couple as a whole) and were delin-
eated separately for each of the following categories: nursing
home and hospital, hospice, doctor and dental bills, prescription
drugs, special services, and all other services. The amount spent
on health insurance premiums for the deceased spouse is also
reported. Thus, the data contained in the exit interview are
somewhat more detailed than those available in Wave 1.
Because the date of death varies across decedents, the time
span included in the exit interview measure of MOOP spending
differs across observations, potentially varying from 1 day (if the
decedent died the day after completing the initial interview) to as
much as roughly 2 years (if the respondent died just prior to the
second interview). Although the survey asks the proxy re-
spondents for the date of death of the deceased, this information
is not available in the public release version of the AHEAD, and
we therefore cannot scale expenses by the length of time elapsed
since the Wave 1 interview (see endnote 3).
For individuals who die between waves, we combine total
MOOP expenses reported in Wave 1 (i.e., one-half of a couple's
expenditure) with expenses reported in the exit interview and
call this ``end-of-life expenditures.'' For respondents who are
married in Wave 1 and for whom a spouse does not die (i.e.,
``survivors''), we combine MOOP expenditures for waves 1
and 2 and use this total to compare with the end-of-life
expenditures of decedents. The time frame for our expenditure
measures therefore varies from 1 to as many as 3 years prior to
death for decedents but always equals 3 years for survivors.
The different length of time over which MOOP expenditures
are measured biases our results against finding greater
expenditures for decedents than survivors because decedents,
by definition, live less than the time between interviews. Thus,
differences in daily expenditures for decedents and survivors
will be even greater than those we report. To assess the degree
of concentration of spending, we also compare just Wave 1
expenditures for the two groups. This comparison provides an
estimate of the degree to which differences in expenditures are
evident well before the date of death. In this case, the time
periods covered by the data are identical and equal to 12
months.
Income is total income of the household from all sources.
Wealth includes the couple's holdings in the form of housing,
vehicles, and other physical assets (less the amount still owed on
those assets), plus all financial assets; Social Security and pen-
sion wealth are not included. All income and wealth estimates,
including MOOP spending, are expressed in 2000 dollars.
A total of 775 people died between the two waves and had
a completed exit interview. (Sixty-nine respondents were
reported to have died but had no exit interview.) Of these 775,
271 were married in Wave 1 and had a spouse who survived to
Wave 2, whereas an additional 3,550 respondents were married
in Wave 1 and remained married to the same (living) spouse in
Wave 2. For many of our analyses, we will compare these 271
decedents with the 3,550 survivors. For the survivors, each
spouse in a married couple contributes one observation to the
analysis. Therefore, all estimates of MOOP are reported on an
individual basis, not for the couple as a whole. As noted earlier,
our sample of decedents includes both males and females,
although we will refer to this group as ``widows.'' Among the 271
decedents, 201 are males, so the surviving spouses are over-
whelmingly female. Therefore, analyses that were conducted
using data only on female survivors led to very similar results.
The sample size was not large enough to examine male survivors
by themselves. Descriptive characteristics of the sample are
reported in Table 1.
OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING
Distribution of Expenditures
Table 2 reports the distribution of MOOP expenditures for
each of the two interview periods and the combined total.
Statistics are presented separately for our initially married dece-
dents and those in surviving couples.
Almost all people, both survivors and decedents, have some
MOOP expenditures. Like most medical spending, MOOP
spending among decedents is highly skewed, with the very top
portion of the distribution incurring enormous costs. The con-
ditional mean expenditure in our sample of decedents is
$11,273; the median is just $7,361. Expenditures rise sharply so
that the 75th percentile is $13,280, and 10% had expenditures of
at least $27,124, more than three times the year 2000 poverty
line of $8,259 for a single elderly person.

There is a substantial difference between expenditures for
decedents and survivors, with survivors incurring costs that are
approximately 38% lower than those for decedents, $7,009
compared with $11,273. As the table illustrates, this difference
is dramatic in the last few months of life, as captured by the exit
interview. For decedents, the conditional mean spending in the
exit interview was $9,013, whereas for survivors, the Wave 2
conditional mean was just $4,984. Recall that even this large
difference is an underestimate of the true gap because the Wave
2 expenditures for survivors are for a 2-year period, whereas
those for decedents pertain to a necessarily shorter period. To
approximate the true difference, assume the date of death is
uniformly distributed between the two waves (i.e., the median/
mean length of time covered by the exit interview is 1 year) and
assume that expenditures are also uniformly distributed across
the 2 years; then, the $9,013 reflects expenditures for a single
year compared with single-year expenditures of $2,500 for
survivors (one half the 2-year total of $4,984). This difference
between average amounts for decedents and survivors is not
the result of a few outliers but rather runs through the entire
distribution; the median, 75th percentile, and 90th percentile for
survivor expenditures are all substantially less than the same
point in the distribution for decedents.
Table 3 reports MOOP expenditures for the two samples by
type of service. These data pertain to the exit interview for
decedents and to the Wave 2 interview for survivors. Medicare
does not cover (most) nursing home stays, prescription drugs,
or all physician charges (the $100 deductible and the 20%
copayment). Therefore, it is not surprising that MOOP expen-
ditures for these categories are quite common. A surprisingly
similar fraction of decedents and survivors had out-of-pocket
prescription drug expenditures: 69.0 versus 66.4%. However,
among decedents, the average expenditures were much larger.
MOOP expenditures for drugs alone among the fraction with
positive expenditures were $4,210 for decedents compared with
$2,992 for survivors.
Following prescription drug costs, the next most common
MOOP expenditure was for insurance premiums, with 58.6% of
the decedents and 64.4% of survivors making premium pay-
ments. The largest difference between decedents and survivors
relates to long-term care. More than one-third of decedents had
some nursing home expense, with an average cost of $7,723.
By comparison, only 11% of survivors incurred costs for nurs-
ing home care, and even among this group, expenditures were
substantially lower than for the decedents averaging just $5,487.
Because nursing home costs averaged roughly $43,000 for
a full-year stay in the mid-1990s (Rhoades & Sommers, 2001),
individuals in both groups must have spent only a fraction of the
year in residence, on average, or had other means of funding.
Relationship to Financial Resources
If medical care is a normal good, ceteris paribus, we would
expect that spending would increase with income and wealth.
However, because insurance coverage alters the cost of care, if
people with more resources are more likely to hold insurance,
the relationship between income and wealth and actual MOOP
expenditures may be less clear. Similarly, rich respondents may
be healthier than poor, need less care, and therefore spend less.
Alternatively, the availability of Medicaid coverage for low-
income elderly persons means that they may face substantially
lower MOOP costs for the same amount of care.
The tabulations in Table 4 suggest little relationship between
MOOP expenditures for the dying spouse and income or wealth
of the couple but a strong relationship between financial status
and the ratio of expenditures to resources. Respondents in the
bottom income or wealth quartile are somewhat less likely to
have had MOOP expenditures than those in the higher quartiles,
likely owing to the higher probability of Medicaid coverage, but

there is no apparent relationship for the rest of the distribution. If
elderly persons in the highest quartiles are, indeed, more likely to
have insurance to supplement Medicare, and if the insurer bears
some of the cost of additional treatments, then the similarity of
spending across the three top quartiles may suggest that the
well-to-do are purchasing a substantially larger quantity of addi-
tional care or perhaps more expensive services than the means in
Table 4 suggest.
In contrast to the patterns for the level of spending, as a share
of income, MOOP expenditures on the dying spouse are much
larger for low-income and low-wealth families. For the elders in
the bottom quartile of income (at Wave 1), MOOP spending in
the last years of life is equal to 70.5% of annual income. This
share declines monotonically to 50.8% for the second quartile
and 29.8% for the third quartile. Even the highest-income group
is not immune to spending large sums of money (relative to
income) on prescription drugs, nursing homes, and other ser-
vices, with their total MOOP expenditures equal to almost one-
fifth of annual income (18.3%).
The ratio of MOOP spending on the dying spouse to wealth is
also strongly negative. The least wealthy families have expenses
equal to 82.8% of their wealth holdings, but this ratio falls
quickly to 13.1% for the second quartile, 5.5% for the third, and
just 1.6% among the highest. These differences suggest that
MOOP expenditures are sufficiently large among the low-
income/low-wealth elderly population that they could have a
sizable effect on the subsequent financial well-being of a sur-
viving spouse.
This measure of MOOP expenses relative to income was
constructed by taking the ratio of the means of these two
variables. An alternative approach is to calculate the ratio of
spending to income (or wealth) for each individual and then
analyze the distribution. This latter approach is more sensitive
to outliers than the former, but it is a more widely used statistic
and has the advantage of generating an entire distribution of
relative expenses. As shown in Table 5, for about one fourth of
those who die, MOOP expenses are relatively small, , 10% of
income. However, one half of decedents have MOOP ex-
penditures of more than roughly one fourth (23.8%) of their
annual income, and 20% spend . 62.5% of income. Because
income is reported on an annual basis and MOOP spending is
the total over as many as 3 years before death, a ratio of . 1.0
is possible. Even in a single year, expenses can be greater than
income if assets are used to pay for the expenses or if the
individual/couple takes on debt. And, indeed, at the upper tail
of the distribution, 11% of the sample had MOOP spending
equal to . 1 full year of income (not shown).

Of primary interest is the effect of these expenditures on the
well-being of the surviving spouse. Here we look not just at
those who lost a spouse between waves, who have been the

focus of the analyses thus far and to whom we refer as ``recently
widowed,'' but also at those who were widowed at an earlier
time (and who have not remarried). The first two columns in
Table 6 display the poverty rate, income, and wealth for elderly
persons who are married and elderly persons who are widowed
at the time of the second interview. The subsequent two columns
report the relevant statistics separately for the recently widowed
and previously widowed. The gaps in income and wealth
between the groups are large. Perhaps unsurprisingly, widows
have less than half the income and wealth of the married elderly,
but the recently widowed have much higher income and wealth
than those who were widowed at the initial interview. Mean
income for married couples is $51,378 compared with $22,841
for all widows and $29,514 and $21,977 for ``recent'' and
``previous'' widows, respectively. The means for wealth are
$620,772 and $314,254 for married and widowed respondents,
respectively, again with large differences existing between
recent and previous widows. These differences are consistent
with the differential mortality hypothesis: that individuals with
low income/wealth die earlier than those with more resources,
creating widows with fewer resources than those whose spouses
are still alive. However, it is also consistent with the idea that the
length of time spent in widowhood is itself a contributing cause
of poverty (Weir, Willis, & Sevak, 2000). After years of rela-
tively low income, a widow eventually spends down all avail-
able assets and has little left to support herself. Despite the
intuitive appeal, evidence from the first two waves of the
AHEAD does not support this hypothesis; the poverty rate of
those previously widowed changed only modestly between
Wave 1 (21.3% [not shown in tables]) and Wave 2 (22.9%), but,
admittedly, this is a very short time period.
Although the raw differences in the resources of married and
widowed respondents are large, on a per-capita basis, widows
actually have similar income and wealth. However, the similarity
of these averages is deceiving. As the second to last row of Table
6 illustrates, the poverty rate of widows is over three times that of
elderly couples, 21.9 versus 6.6%. This large difference in the
poverty rate exists in part because of the assumptions about
returns to scale in consumption embedded in the definition of the
poverty line: The federal poverty line for singles is 79% that of
couples, not 50% as this per-capita analysis assumes. Thus,
similar resources per capita translate into substantially higher
poverty rates. Again, the recently widowed fare somewhat better
than the previously widowed.
We now examine the factors accounting for the high rates of
poverty among widows, focusing on the relative importance of
the roles of differential mortality and MOOP expenditures on
the dying spouse. Declines in income for other reasons such as
reductions in Social Security income, pension income, or asset
income are left as a residual.
Pre-Widowhood Economic Status and Effects of
Widowhood on Poverty
Table 7 demonstrates the differences in poverty rates between
soon-to-be widowed respondents and couples in which both
spouses survive. The table reports poverty rates and average
income in Wave 1 and Wave 2 for the two groups. The first goal
of the analysis is to determine the effect of widowhood itself on
poverty. One potential estimator is a simple pre/post comparison,
that is, a ``difference'' estimator. For those who were married in
Wave 1 and widowed in Wave 2, poverty rose from a first period
rate of 11.43 to 17.59% in Wave 2. Therefore, the pre/post esti-
mator of the effects of widowhood on poverty would imply that
widowhood is associated with an increase in poverty by 6.16
percentage points (17.59 Ã11.43; see endnote 4).
However, the poverty rate changes over time, even for those
who were not widowed. Among the surviving couples in our
sample, poverty declined from 6.34 to 6.10%, suggesting that the
increase in poverty associated with widowhood might have been
even greater had underlying economic conditions not intervened.
We therefore take a ``difference-in-difference'' approach. The
change in poverty for continuously married couples was Ã0.24
percentage point. Because poverty rose by 6.16 percentage
points among widows, the difference-in-difference estimator im-
plies that widowhood is associated with an increase in poverty
by 6.40 percentage points (6.16 Ã¾ 0.24), slightly greater than
the simple first-differenced estimate. This 6.40-percentage point
increase translates into a 56.0% increase in poverty.
Table 7 makes clear that a large gap in the relative well-being
of widowed and nonwidowed elderly individuals existed prior
to the death of the spouse. In Wave 1, the poverty rate was 11.43
for decedent couples and 6.34 for surviving couples, a difference
of 5.09 percentage points. By Wave 2, the difference in poverty
rates for the two groups was 11.49. Thus, 44% (5.09/11.49) of
the post-widowhood difference resulted from initial conditions.
The remaining 56% is due to other factors surrounding widow-
hood, including MOOP spending on the dying spouse, other
changes in wealth, loss of the spouse's income, and assumed
returns to scale in consumption embedded in the poverty line.
Role of Spouse's MOOP Spending in
Last Years of Life
Many of the poor widows in our sample were poor in Wave 1
while their husbands were still alive. Our calculations indicate
that 39% percent of those in poverty in Wave 2 were also poor
in Wave 1. However, for the majority of poor widows (56%),
poverty accompanies widowhood. For those who do transit into
poverty, how important are MOOP expenditures in these tran-
sitions? From the tabulations presented earlier, it certainly
seems as though these expenses could be sufficiently large rel-

ative to income, especially for lower-income families, that they
could move the (nonmedical) attainable level of consumption
for someone from above the poverty line to well below it. Here
we undertake a simulation to assess the potential for MOOP
spending to alter well-being. We assume that all the money that
was used on MOOP spending for the decedent as reported in
the exit interview--that is, roughly the last year of life--would
have been available to the surviving spouse to spend over
his/her remaining life. To implement this change in financial
resources, the total MOOP expenditures from the exit inter-
view are amortized over the remainder of the widow's expected
life, and this amortized amount is added to the Wave 2 income
(an interest rate of 4% was used for the calculation of amortized
MOOP expenditures).
The mean value of MOOP spending from the exit interviews
is approximately $9,000 and average life expectancy is roughly 9
years, yielding an average annual amortized amount of $1,156.
Because MOOP spending differs greatly across decedents and is
highly skewed, the additional income imputed to the surviving
spouses also varies: The 25th and 75th percentiles of the distri-
bution of amortized MOOP spending are $174 and $1,275,
respectively. When these individual-specific amounts are added
to the Wave 2 income of the surviving spouses, the poverty rate
for these widows falls from 17.6% (as reported in Table 7,
column 6) to 15.9% (not shown in tables). This approach illus-
trates the potentially important effect of MOOP spending asso-
ciated with the dying spouse on the economic well-being of the
surviving spouse.
An alternative measure to the poverty rate is the poverty gap.
The poverty gap is the sum over all those in poverty of the
amount by which income falls below the poverty line, that is, the
minimum amount of income that would need to be transferred to
poor families to move them all out of poverty. To assess the role
of MOOP spending in affecting well-being beyond the simple
movement across the poverty line, we also calculate the poverty
gap with and without adding the amortized MOOP spending to
Wave 2 income. Doing so reduced the poverty gap by 28%,
similar to the effect on poverty.
Distribution of Declines in Income
A final ``cause'' of poverty is the different returns to scale
used for Social Security benefits and the poverty line. As noted
earlier, a substantial amount of ``new poverty'' among widows
exists because the poverty line for singles is equal to 79% of that
for couples, while Social Security (and many pensions) fall by
much more. If we compare income before and after the death of
a spouse (including the amortized medical expenditures in post-
widowhood income), we find that 41% of the sample had
a decline in income of .33% (the expected change in Social
Security benefits), 11% had a decline of between 20 and 33%,
and 18% had a smaller decline. Twenty-nine percent had an
increase in income. This change in the poverty line when mov-
ing from a two- to one-person measure is somewhat arbitrary.
With a larger decrease in the needs level, fewer widows would
be counted among the poor, whereas with a smaller change,
more would be so classified. Similarly, if Social Security ben-
efits were reduced by 21% rather than by one-third, the risk of
poverty would be substantially lessened.
To move away from this single measure, we analyze the
effect of MOOP expenditures on the dying spouse on the entire
distribution of income. Figure 2 displays the actual distribution
of income in Wave 2 for our new widows, with the widows
separated into 10 deciles based on income in Wave 2.
Amortized MOOP expenditures are then added to Wave 2
income, with the resulting income distribution displayed in the
figure. As expected, the distribution of income at the bottom
improves: The share with income less than $6,713 falls from 10
to 7.5%. This vast improvement for low-income families is
surprising because one would have expected their costs to be
covered by Medicaid. There are also notable improvements at
Figure 2. Distribution of income in Wave 2 with and without adjusting for medical out-of-pocket (MOOP) spending on the dying spouse.

widows with income greater than $49,868 increasing from 10
to 12%.
SUMMARY
Despite improvements in income and poverty among the el-
derly throughout the last century, nearly one-fourth of elderly
widows remain poor. Not only must widows deal with the
psychological effects of losing their spouse, they must deal
with a precarious financial situation that often accompanies
widowhood. In fact, our estimates using the most recent na-
tionally representative panel data suggest that widowhood
per se is associated with a rise in poverty of between 6.2 and 6.4
percentage points.
Previous researchers have emphasized changes in income
and differential mortality. Here, we examined an alternative
avenue, the role of MOOP expenditures for a dying spouse.
Although the Medicare program is extremely generous, it does
not provide coverage for all types of care; most notably, it does
not provide complete coverage for very long hospital stays or
for most long-term care needs. Furthermore, until 2006
Medicare will not cover prescription drugs. These gaps leave
many elderly persons vulnerable to potentially large out-of-
pocket expenditures. Because such expenditures are likely to be
largest near death, the burden of paying for health care toward
the end of life may most severely affect the financial well-being
of the surviving spouse. Thus, MOOP spending, and indirectly
the gaps in Medicare that leave such costs to the elderly
individual, may play a role in the high rates of poverty among
widows.
We find that, in fact, MOOP expenditures are particularly
large at the end of life. Moreover, these MOOP expenditures are
large relative to income, particularly among low-income elderly
individuals. For people in the lowest income quartile (i.e.,
income of below $12,000), this final MOOP spending is equal
to approximately 70% of income. Moreover, we conclude that
out-of-pocket medical expenditures can, indeed, cause a sharp
decline in the financial well-being of widows.

END NOTES
1. Legislative efforts through the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Retirement
Equities Act (REACT) have sought to ensure that widows
receive survivorship benefits from their deceased hus-
band's pension. See the U.S. Department of Labor
Employee Benefits Security Administration Web site
(www.dol.gov/ebsa/) for a discussion of these laws.
2. The Medicare Part B premium is $45.50 in year 2000
dollars (U.S. Congress, House Ways and Means, 2000).
3. If the length of time between the first interview and the
date of death varies systematically with other character-
istics of the deceased, our results could be biased. For
instance, suppose high-income individuals live longer
than low-income individuals and are therefore more
likely to die towards the end of the 2-year window.
Because those who live longer will likely incur greater
MOOP expenditures ceteris paribus, we will (perhaps
incorrectly) conclude that high-income individuals spend
more on medical care in any period. However, because
the window is relatively small, and our initial
respondents are in a fairly narrow age range, we do
not believe our conclusions were altered by these
potential biases.
4. Using the Retirement History Study (RHS), which
consists of people aged 58Â­63 in 1969, Holden,
Burkhauser, and Myers (1986) found that poverty
increased substantially in the wave right after death
and then fell substantially in the subsequent wave. They
concluded that this pattern is explained by the fact that
in the wave after death, income of the spouse who died
during that year was not reported by the survivor. We
investigated this issue by conducting analyses using
WIDOW POVERTY AND MEDICAL EXPENDITURES S167
income data from the first four waves of the AHEAD
and found that the poverty rate among widows rises by
8 percentage points between the wave just prior to death
and the wave just after death, which is consistent with
the estimate reported in Table 6. Most importantly, there
is virtually no change in the poverty rate (just a one
percentage point increase) between the wave just after
death and the second wave after death. Therefore, the
pattern observed in the RHS is not observed in the
AHEAD.
