Introduction
The main aim of this article is to rethink about poverty from
an Islamic perspective through a critical analysis of the con-
temporary vision of poverty and poverty alleviation strate-
gies that have been put forward by Muslim scholars.
Generally, this article attempts to develop a fair, balanced,
and holistic understanding of poverty and strategy for pov-
erty alleviation from a religious perspective. More specifi-
cally, it has the following two objectives. First, to investigate
the vision of poverty and strategies for poverty alleviation of
contemporary Muslim scholars; and second, to analyze the
strategies for poverty alleviation that have been considered
as Islamic. In so doing, this article is divided into two main
sections. The first paints the backdrop of the whole discus-
sion by highlighting the contemporary vision of poverty and
the contemporary "Islamic" strategies of poverty alleviation.
The second delves into critical analysis of the contemporary
"Islamic" strategies for poverty alleviation.
Indeed, this article is a preliminary groundwork that
strictly focuses only on the understanding of the vision of
poverty and strategies for poverty alleviation of contempo-
rary Muslim scholars. It neither intends to provide a specific
detailed redefinition of poverty, nor does it formulates the
measurements for the identification of individuals infected by
moral and spiritual poverty.An in-depth study on the redefini-
tion of poverty and the measurements for the identification of
such individuals--with the support of the verses from the
Holy Qur'an, sayings of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon
him), and works of classical scholars--need to be addressed
meticulously in a separate paper.
The Backdrop
As an effort to paint the backdrop of this article, the main-
stream vision of poverty and the so-called "Islamic strate-
gies" in poverty alleviation are discussed below. The former
reflects the general perception of scholars on poverty while
the latter shows how such a perception has shaped the strate-
gies for poverty alleviation proposed by the Muslim writers.
Mainstream Vision of Poverty
Almost all Muslim scholars who write on poverty, irrespec-
tive of their ideological underpinnings, seem to dislike pov-
erty. They do not only perceive poverty as having negative

Contemporary Vision of Poverty and
Islamic Strategy for Poverty Alleviation
Muhammad Syukri Salleh1
Abstract
Currently, irrespective of one's religious, ideological, and political inclination, poverty is seen as a destructive force in all
aspects. Subsequently, various strategies have been formulated to alleviate poverty. But what are actually the components
of the destructive force of poverty in the vision of contemporary Muslim scholars? What kind of Islamic strategies have
they formulated out of this vision? This article seeks to answer these two main questions by first investigating into the
contemporary vision of poverty that has been adopted by Muslim scholars, followed second by an investigation into the
strategies for poverty alleviation they proposed, and third, by critically analyzing their vision of poverty and strategies from
an Islamic perspective. Based on a textual analysis of references, this article displays an inadequacy of the vision and strategies
of the contemporary Muslim scholars for ignoring material-spiritual definition of poverty, as well as for formulating strategies
for poverty alleviation using an exogenous, top-down approach. In a nutshell, this article attempts to provide a justification
for rescrutinization of the vision of poverty from an Islamic perspective, and for a reconstruction of the poverty alleviation
strategies based on the faith of the Muslim communities themselves.

nature in itself but also implicate negative consequences to
individuals, society, and nations. Poverty is regarded as
being one of the worst problems in society (Nofal, 1984), as
a dangerous social problem (al Qaradawi, 2002), as the most
terrible social ills and main enemy to nation's development
planning (Abdullah, 1984), as a social time bomb (Fadhil,
1992), as one of the oldest enemies of mankind (Iqbal, 2002,
p. 1), as the greatest evil (Huq, 1996, p. 226), as a threat to
human's beliefs and to the security and stability of the soci-
ety as a whole (Salih, 1999, p. 91), as disrupting human dig-
nity and stability of a nation (Fadhil, 1992), as not only an
economic phenomena but also a social and political problem
(Alhabshi, 1993, 1996), and as very dangerous to individuals
and society, aqidah and belief, thinking and culture, and fam-
ily and races as a whole (al Qardhawi, 1980).
Simultaneously, the negative consequences of the pov-
erty are also highlighted. They argued that poverty degrades
Muslim's dignity (Ahmad, 1991), emerging along with
unemployment, catastrophes, indebtedness, unequitable
income distribution, and so on (al Qaradawi, 2002), to vari-
ous evils, including apostasy (irtidad/ar-riddah) (Fadhil,
1992), leading to crimes and hatred between rich and poor
(Nofal, 1984), leading to untold sufferings resulting in beg-
ging (Sadeq, 2002, p. 17), entailed with the decline of many
empires and civilization following the struggle between the
haves and the have-nots (Iqbal, 2002, p. 1), leading to inca-
pacity, helplessness, and dependence on others, driving a
person close to disbelief, and it is in fact in conflict with
human dignity (Chapra, 2008). As poverty is regarded as the
root of many crimes and misdeeds, it jeopardizes the moral,
social, and spiritual standards of a society; creates imbal-
ances in social and moral aspects as much as of an individ-
ual as of a society (Huq, 1996, p. 226); and denies people
the freedom of choice and actions that can help them getting
rid of deprivation (Ahmed, 2004, p. 45). All in all, poverty
is seen as serious not only from a humanitarian point of
view but also from an Islamic point of view because abject
poverty is incompatible with Islamic ideology (Ariff, 1988,
p. 336).
Based on such a disastrous nature and consequences of
the poverty, these writers make a firm stance on poverty.
Qardhawi (1980) pushes that poverty must be handled,
obstructed, and fought. Fadhil (1992) argues that poverty
must be killed. Ibrahim (1983/1984) says that fighting pov-
erty is a Holy War (jihad). Ahmad (1991) perceives that
fighting poverty is equal to upholding dignity. Al-Qardhawi
(cited by Ibrahim, 1983/1984, p. 25) issues fatwa that war
could be launched due to poverty, and that Caliph Abu Bakar
Al-Siddiq's war against those who refused to pay zakat (ar-
riddah) could be considered as a war against poverty (al-
harb `al faqr). It is said to be the first war in Islamic history
to protect the fate of the oppressed poor. Ahmed (2004) pro-
poses poverty eradication through the provision of basic
needs of every citizen and regards it as a duty of every
Muslim society. Chapra (2008) issues a stance that taking
care of the basic needs of the poor is a collective obligation
(fard kifayah) of a Muslim society. In terms of social impact
of zakat, Zaim (1985, p. 117) states that zakat ensures redis-
tribution of income and the state uses it for the purpose of
alleviating poverty. Zakat is also designed to promote the
welfare function of the public expenditure. The argument is
quite similar to those of Nodal (as cited in Sadeq, 1994, p.
17) who explains the function of zakat to eradicate poverty
and argues that poverty is one of the worst problems in a
society. Khan (1995, p. 131) says that reduction in poverty
and economic inequalities is one of the primary objectives of
the Islamic economics system and Islamic banking can play
an important role in achieving this objective.
Contemporary "Islamic" Strategies for Poverty
Alleviation
Discussion on the strategies that have been undertaken both
in Islam and mainstream domain are definitely huge and do
not adequately fit into the limited space of this article. It is
acknowledged that the mainstream strategies in alleviating
poverty have gained a considerable accomplishment, in spite
of their `tangibility-centred' nature that denies spiritual
domain, hence becoming un-holistic. However, this paper
does not mean to deliberate on the accomplishment and the
un-holistic strategies. Instead, this paper only concentrates
on the so-called Islamic strategies for poverty alleviation as
are suggested by certain authors, with a brief introduction of
an overall strategies.
In general, poverty alleviation strategies could be said to
have passed four phases (Iqbal, 2002, pp. 10-12). First, in the
1950s and 1960s, it has been concentrated on the growth in
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), hoping that it would
"trickle-down" to the poor. But this was much to be desired.
Second, in the 1970s, the attention shifted to direct provision
of nutritional, health, and educational needs of the poor as a
matter of public policy. But this was realized that it was not
sustainable in the long run as it puts heavy burden on govern-
ment budgets. Third, in the 1980s and 1990s, emphasis was
shifted to efficient labor-intensive pattern of development
and increase of investment in human capital formation. But it
was found that promotion of labor-intensive growth is diffi-
cult, provision of basic services to the poor requires more
public spending and involves the trade-off between the inter-
ests of the poor and the non-poor, and there were misman-
agement of public funds and corruption. Fourth, in 2000s,
the strategy shifted to promoting opportunities, facilitating
empowerment, and enhancing securities. This was based on
the realization on the importance of the participation of the
poor in decision making, better governance of public funds,
and protection of the poor from economic and natural shocks
through public policies. The strategy involves, inter alia, pro-
vision of material opportunities such as jobs, credits, and
infrastructure; cohesive pattern and quality of growth, mar-
ket reforms that reflect local institutional and structural
Salleh 3
conditions, greater equity in the distribution of income,
access to market opportunities and public sector services;
sound, responsive, and accountable institutions; reduction of
vulnerability to economic shocks, natural disasters; ill health
and disability; building assets of poor people; diversifying
household activities; and providing a range of insurance
mechanisms to cope with adverse shocks.
For the poverty alleviation through Islamic approach,
Iqbal (2002) starts with a belief that strategies for poverty
alleviation involve two trade-offs, that is, first, between inter-
ests of the "haves" and the "have-nots," and second, between
the role of public sector versus the market (pp. 12-13). For the
first trade-off, he comes back to the very worldview of the
Islamic teaching, that life in this world, and the context of
poverty, the difference in income and wealth, is actually a
test. Those bestowed by Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala (May He
be glorified and exalted) (SWT) with high income and wealth
need to share the resource with the poor, and the poor, while
not grudging against the rich, are assured to be richly rewarded
in the life Hereafter for bearing their hardship patiently.
As for the trade-off between the public sector and the
market, Iqbal (2002) suggests an "institutional approach" to
achieve its redistributive goals (pp. 13-20). The market as an
institution is allowed to play its role, while other institutions,
such as zakah, awqaf, takaful, irfaq (non-profit sector), and
so on, become supplements to correct some in-built tenden-
cies in the market solutions.
The above idea of alleviating poverty through the "institu-
tional approach," as Iqbal (2002, p. 13) terms it, has become
one of the main approaches advocated by many Muslim
scholars. In realizing the zakat, for instance, Yasin and Tahir
(2002) advocates full-scale Islamization, as opposed to a less
efficient policy such as maintaining the status quo, introduc-
ing zakat only, and replacement of interest with profit shar-
ing. al Qaradawi (2002, p. 569) regards zakat system as a
permanent mechanism from within the economy in continu-
ous transferring of income from the rich to the poor, with the
aim to enrich and remove the later completely from poverty
level through sufficient income and ability to take charge of
all their needs by themselves. According to him, the basic
objective of zakat indeed is to solve poverty, along with other
social problems such as unemployment, catastrophes, indebt-
edness, inequitable income distribution, and so on. This
could be done by providing the poor and the needy, as two of
eight groups of recipients of zakat (asnaf), with necessary
education, training, and capital equipment.
More direct that manifests the institutional approach is
the writing by Ahmed (2004). He believes that zakat, along
with awqaf, are able to play a role in policies of redistribu-
tion of assets and opportunities, capacity building and
wealth creation, and extending income support, hence alle-
viating poverty (Ahmed, 2004, p. 15). Ahmed (2004, pp.
15-18) believes in the ability of zakat and awqaf to play a
role in policies of redistribution of assets and opportunities,
capacity building and wealth creation, and extending income
support. He suggests four approaches in alleviating poverty
through the zakat and awqaf institutions: first, by integrat-
ing zakat and awqaf into the overall development scheme;
second, by introducing laws and regulations that can create
incentives for the proper functioning of zakat and awqaf
institutions and establishing institutions that operate in an
efficient and transparent ways; third, by introducing effec-
tive organizational structures that could build trust among
people to maximize collection/revenues; and fourth, by cre-
ating institutional development and diversity, with the help
of various institutions using contemporary organizational
structures and instruments to reinforce the endeavors in
poverty alleviation.
Awqaf is also perceived as one of the irfaq (nonprofit) sec-
tors that is able to support the elimination of interest in
accomplishing redistributional function, hence poverty alle-
viation (Tag el Din, 2002). Cizakca (2002) believes that
awqaf system could help in reducing government expendi-
ture, hence reducing budget deficit, the need for government
borrowing, curbing the crowding-out effect, reduction in
interest rates, removing major impediment to private invest-
ment and growth, as well as solving the problem of under-
supply of public goods.
Huq (1996, pp. 229-230) also advocates the institutional
approach by going beyond the institutions of zakat and awqaf
per se to include positive roles of other Islamic economics
institutions as well. Apart from zakat (which he terms as
involuntary sadaqat or compulsory tax on idle wealth/
income after the nisab is met), he also mentions ushr (com-
pulsory payment in the form of tax from the produce of land
or specifically zakat on the produce of land); voluntary con-
tributions such as hibah, waqf, gifts, wills, and so on; muda-
raba (profit sharing on trading capital in place of interest);
law of inheritance; organization of various cooperatives, and
so on. Two other institutions that have been advocated by
other scholars are microcredit or microfinance (Hassan &
Alamgir, 2002; Obaidullah, 2008a, 2008b; Obaidullah &
Khan, 2008), and takaful (mutual surety) (Bakar, 2002). In
fact, Hassan and Alamgir (2002) argue that microcredit has
been found to be an effective instrument for creating self-
employment, while Bakar (2002) argues that takaful could
become an important element in the modern poverty-reduc-
tion agenda by protecting people from shocks, both eco-
nomic and natural.
Another approach to Islamic poverty alleviation adopted
by Muslim scholars is what could be called economic
approach, which is based mainly on the belief in economic
growth. Iqbal (2002, pp. 15-16), for instance, believes in the
importance of economic growth in alleviating poverty, espe-
cially in the pattern of growth that corrects the distribution of
income. In addition, population growth and demographic
changes are also suggested to be taken into consideration, so
that young people could be developed into a productive
workforce through human capital formation, job creation,
finance facilities, and secure environment.
4 SAGE Open
Sirageldin (2002) proposes "effective growth strategies
with a built-in equitable opportunity mechanism" as the
foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction policies (p. 41).
To him, these strategies are in harmony with the Islamic ethi-
cal system, in particular the axiomatic approach developed
by Naqvi (1994) which is based on four basic tenets: Unity
(Tawhid) which indicates the vertical dimension of the ethi-
cal system; Equilibrium (al-`adl wa'l-ihsan) which provides
for the horizontal dimension of equity leaving a lot of free-
dom for policy details; Free-will (ikhtiyar) in which careful
intellection is required to interpret-reinterpret that freedom
within specific social contexts, and to suit the needs of
changing times (p. 31); and Responsibility (fard) which
states that although "responsibility" is voluntary, individuals
and society need to conserve for the public good Sirageldin
(2002, p. 26).
Khan's (1995, p. 19) ideas also could be considered as
falling into the economic approach. Although he does not
directly talk about the growth, his suggestions are full of eco-
nomic formulation. He suggests a set of criteria for poverty
elimination that is believed to be able to fulfill the basic
needs of the people. These criteria are firstly, low-cost; sec-
ondly, the state is not forced to indulge in heavy borrowing;
and thirdly, it is consistent with (indeed built-in within) the
system. The strategy emphasizes motivating all human
resources to take up every possible opportunity to contribute
to family income; subsistence and poor families should be
given every encouragement for self-employed activity and
improved family enterprise. This strategy is believed to be in
consistent with the spirit of Islamic economy and that Islam
provides for institutions for the success of such a strategy.
Critical Analysis of the Vision of
Poverty and the "Islamic" Strategy for
Poverty Alleviation
Contemplating on the above vision of poverty and the so-
called Islamic strategies for poverty alleviation leads one to
realize that the vision and strategies are actually suffering of
at least three deficiencies. They are first, the absence of the
redefinition of the very poverty itself; second, the exogenous
domination of the vision on poverty and poverty alleviation
strategies; and third, the adoption of a top-down approach to
vision of poverty and the strategies for poverty alleviation.
The deliberations of these deficiencies are as follows.
The Absence of a Redefinition of Poverty
As shown earlier, there are already literatures that attempt to
deliberate on the Islamic vision of poverty and on the Islamic
strategies for poverty alleviation. However, they are heavily
concentrated on two main things. First, in regard to the vision
of poverty, all of them dislike poverty and suggest the elimi-
nation of poverty as much as possible to avoid its negative
consequences. Second, in regard to the strategies for poverty
alleviation, they concentrate heavily on either Islamic insti-
tutions or on economic formulation. In both cases, poverty is
accepted as is understood by conventional thinking, leaving
alone the very base of the attempt, namely, the definition of
the poverty itself. They, for instance, elaborate on the use of
zakat and awqaf,1 or on microfinance,2 or on takaful,3 or on
economic formulation,4 but all seem to be done with a view
of overcoming the problem of the undefined conventional
poverty, not an Islamically defined poverty.
Undeniably, they are commended for at least providing
the bases for the endeavors in poverty alleviation.
Nevertheless, their vision and strategies are embedded with
the mere economic indicators and instruments such as
growth, market, income, wealth, employment, capital, assets,
revenues, and profits, as if that poverty is void of spiritual
dimension. To make them in tandem with Islam, they pro-
pose an injection of Islamic elements such as Unity (Tawhid),
Equilibrium (al-`adl wa'l-ihsan), Free-will (ikhtiyar), and
Responsibility (fard) (Naqvi, 1994, p. 31; Sirageldin, 2002,
p. 26).
Of all the scholars researched, only Huq (1996, p. 225)
seems to mention briefly about the meaning of poverty, but
still it hardly could be considered as an Islamic definition. He
still uses "the level of living" and "subsistence level" as the
indicators of poverty.5 His categories of the poor are based
on incomes, ability to buy goods, and services (purchasing
power) to fulfill minimum basic needs for economically
decent living. In addition, he defines the poor (fuqara) as
those who lack the opportunities or abilities or both to earn
their livelihoods, which may lead to suffer social humilia-
tion, economic deprivation, and moral and spiritual vacuum
(Huq, 1996, p. 226). Kahf (2002, p. 22) also, in mentioning
about the first two categories of zakat recipients--the poor
and the needy--briefly mentions the difference in opinion of
zakat scholars on the definition of the poor and the needy,
based on human needs in relation to wealth and income. The
first group of scholars he says defines the poor as a person
who has less than his needs in terms of wealth and income
whereas the needy is that who owns nothing. The second
group of scholars, however, considers that the poor is in a
worse situation than the needy. The detailed discourse on
this, however, was not deliberated because to Kahf (2002, p.
22), it is immaterial who is in a worse situation. What matters
is that both cannot support their needs by their own means,
hence the supplementary support for sustenance, in this case,
through zakat.
The definition of poverty and the poor outlined by both
Huq (1996) and Kahf (2002, p. 22) is still not been able to
liberate itself from the entanglement of tangible indicators
used by conventional economics. Both basically ignore the
spiritual dimension embedded within the poor-self, as is
within the rich-self. So is Sirageldin (2002, p. 31). Even
though stressing on the insufficiency of the quantitative
money-metric consumption (or income)­based approach in
measuring the multidimensionality of the concept of poverty,
Salleh 5
he could not come out of the tangible indicators. His sugges-
tion to overcome the above problem is based on the expan-
sionofneedsandmeasurementofsociopoliticalexternalities.6
Such a phenomenon too could be found in the work of Khan
(n.d., p. 4). He sees poverty, supposedly from Islamic per-
spective, as related to two concepts, that is, the concept of
necessities (dharuriyyah) and the concept of exemption limit
(nisab). Necessities here refer to all activities and things that
are essential to preserve the five fundamentals of human life,
that is, religion, physical self, intellect or knowledge, off-
spring, and wealth (that is the maqasid al-shari'ah, though
he does not use the term so). One is considered poor if he
does not possess sufficient necessities to fulfill his basic
needs based on the above five foundations for good individ-
ual and social life. Nisab refers to a certain minimum quan-
tum of any good or wealth that must be possessed before that
good and wealth is subject to zakat. In zakat, the nisab
requirement implies that those who do not meet the nisab
requirement are not only excused from paying zakat but also
considered poor and hence eligible to receive zakat. Even a
supposedly Islamic-oriented writing such as of Patel (1983,
p. 4) defines poverty in a material-oriented sense. He says,
"Poverty, in its pure meaning is the insufficiency and the lack
of the material means to live a tolerable and meaningful
existence."
If there could be considered a little bit of Islamic elements
in the definition of poverty, they are perhaps the definitions
put forward by Salih (1999, p. 91) and Iqbal (2002, p. 12).
Both consider poverty as a test of man's allegiance to his
Creator and a great fear. The Quranic verse which is related
to this argument, inter alia, is as follows: "We will surely test
you with a measure of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth,
lives, and fruits; and give good news to the patient" (al-
Qur`an 2:155).Ahmed (2004) also holds to the testing stance.
Besides that, he also agrees with Chapra (1980) who says
that Islam is a religion of balance and therefore has given
equal emphasis on both the spiritual and worldly affairs.
Ahmed (2004) is well aware of the integration of the material
and spiritual dimensions of poverty. He argues that the con-
cept of richness/poverty in Islam does represent not only
deprivation of goods and services but also lack of richness/
poverty in spirit.
Unfortunately, however, Ahmed (2004) has purposely left
out this broader comprehensive concept of poverty, to only
focus on the notion of deprivation in the economic sense. He
does so with the belief that the economic concept of poverty
and its eradication indirectly addresses the spiritual aspects.
Like what has been asserted by Rahman (1974), Ahmed
(2004, p. 20) believes that the individuals can improve their
spiritual lives by improving their material life. Ahmed (2004,
p. 55) too, in spite of his consciousness that the concept of
poverty has evolved from deprivation of material needs, edu-
cation, and health to more broader ideas of vulnerability,
exposure to risk, voicelessness, and powerlessness still
focuses his discussion on the former economic notion. Such
a similar treatment of the definition of poverty also has been
adopted by Mannan (1988, pp. 305-306). In spite of his
acknowledgment that human poverty in Islam is concerned
both with material as well as cultural and spiritual poverty,
and that the abundance of goods does not alone ensure rich-
ness in Islam, he purposely shy away from the inclusion of
cultural and spiritual poverty in his discussion on the com-
prehensive meaning of poverty, to just confine the discussion
to material poverty and Islamic responses to it.
The Domination of an Exogenous Vision on
Poverty and Poverty Alleviation Strategies
Another deficiency of the vision on poverty and strategies
for poverty alleviation relate very much to their exogenous
characteristic. As reflected in the above discussion, scholars
who are dominating the thinking on poverty are actually the
outsiders, not the poor themselves. These outsiders not only
develop the definition of poverty based on their own respec-
tive perception but also do not take into account the poor's
perception of poverty in the construction of the definition as
well as in the formulation of the strategies for poverty
alleviation.
Salleh and Md. Yusoff (1997) actually did research and
write a paper on the poor's perception of poverty, but seems
that it is the only one available on it. Even though there is an
attempt to seek people's perception from below as has been
done by Amiel and Cowell (1997), it was just the perception
of the people of the already determined standard axioms used
in the literature on poverty measurement (i.e., anonymity,
growth of the poor, monotonicity, focus, and principle of
transfers). Using a sample of 486 students from Australia,
Israel, and the United States, Amiel and Cowell (1997)
investigated the extent to which individuals' perceptions of
poverty correspond to the axioms. It was found that the first
3 axioms were reasonably well supported by the respondents,
while the fourth gained very little support and the last was
the least well supported. It is therefore a poor's perception of
the axioms of poverty outlined by still the outsiders, not by
the poor themselves. Institutionally, Islamic Development
Bank (IDB) has in fact had its consciousness in going down
to the grassroots, but the impact is much to be desired. For
example, IDB tries to establish strategic partnership and col-
laborations and, as clearly stated in the Mission of IDB in the
Vision 1440H, ascertain the needs and aspirations of target
communities before formulating any program. It also con-
sults the stakeholders especially the Muslim communities
themselves in every proposed program and design the pro-
gram in close collaboration with them, as well as encourage
local initiative (IDB, 2006b, pp. 31-35). However, at the
implementational level, such an effort does not necessarily
work. The real determinant of the efforts and the full power
is in the hand of neither the IDB nor the communities, but
instead in the hand of their respective authority, again as an
exogenous agent.

The Adoption of Top-Down Approach to Vision of
Poverty and the Strategies for Poverty Alleviation
Come together with the exogenous characteristics of the def-
inition of poverty and the poverty alleviation strategies is the
adoption of a top-down approach. This is another deficiency
suffered by the definition of poverty and the poverty allevia-
tion strategies. A top-down approach may come up with a
favorable political will, resources, bureaucratic machinery,
and facilities, but they are still considered as outsiders, hence
"exogeneity" of their ideas. Most of the outsiders involved in
the formulation and designation of the definition and strate-
gies, respectively, are usually development authorities and
agencies--local and foreign--many of which are not neces-
sarily inclined to Islam. Their epistemological and philo-
sophical roots may be totally different from those of the
Muslim poor communities. Although by material indicators
there has been a considerable contribution to the alleviation
of poverty, but the contribution comes together with an
accompaniment of a new alien cultural­societal construc-
tion, and in many cases, even contradicts their previous
indigenous belief and cultural practices.
Conclusion
The above discussion leads to a conclusion that may provide
a base for further research. The contemporary vision of pov-
erty seems to treat poverty as fully negative, without a room
for rescrutinization, let alone an effort to do so. Such a stance
does not provide an opportunity to study in-depth many
Islamic teachings relating to poverty. For instance, in a
Hadith Qudsi, Allah SWT says,
Some of My worshippers are only reformed and best fitted with
poverty and if I to enrich them this will spoil them, and some of
My worshippers are only reformed and fitted with richness and
if I impoverish them this will spoil them.
In other words, the poor and the rich seem to be selective,
depending on Allah's prerogative, mercy, and love, in ensur-
ing the avoidance of spoiling the worshippers. Another
Hadith sounds as follows: Abu Hurairah reported that the
Messenger of Allah SAW had said, "Richness does not lie in
the abundance of worldly goods but richness is the richness
of the heart itself" (Muslim, p. 501).
Both teachings open a vast area for the rescrutinization of
the definition of poverty and the formulation of strategies for
poverty alleviation. The former signals the selectiveness of
the rich and the poor, while the later reflects the importance
of spirituality in matters relating to poverty. Both could per-
haps provide an understanding why the poor Companions
(ahlus suffah) were never requested by the Holy Prophet
(peace be upon him) to be rich, while a rich Companion
Sayyidina Abdul Rahman bin 'Auf was not allowed to be
poor. If such a rescrutinization is taken into account in the
definition of poverty, the formulation of an Islamic poverty
alleviation strategy may come up with a new form. For
instance, the target groups could perhaps be broadly catego-
rized into four groups. First, those who are poor both spiritu-
ally and materially; second, those who are poor spiritually
and rich materially; third, those who are rich spiritually and
poor materially; and fourth, those who are rich both spiritu-
ally and materially. Expectedly, one may probably clear with
the measurements of the materially rich and poor, but won-
der on how to measure the spiritually rich and poor. Leaving
this question alone for a while to be researched and deliber-
ated further later on, this categorization would probably
entail with two implications. First, the target groups of the
poverty alleviation need to encompass all strata of society,
including the rich themselves. Second, true target groups
may be identified, resources may be rightly allocated, and
wastage may be avoided. The most to be given serious atten-
tion and intervention, with reasonable allocation, is of course
the first category of the target group, viz. those who are poor
both spiritually and materially. This is followed by the sec-
ond group, that is the rich who are spiritually poor that may
expose them to adverse attributes such as oppression, corrup-
tion, and so on, and the third categories who even though
poor materially but neither troubling nor burdening the soci-
ety due to their rich in spirituality. The aim of the whole pro-
cess is definitely to create the fourth group who are rich both
spiritually and materially.

5. Specifically, he defines poverty as the "the level of living that
lies below subsistence level." For the poor, he refers to "those
whose incomes are not adequate for buying a bundle of goods
and services required to meet a minimum of calories for sus-
taining a decent living with basic needs, like food, clothings,
shelter, health and education" (Huq, 1996, pp. 225-226).
6. Sirageldin (2002, p. 31) suggests that the needs to be expanded
to measure sociopolitical externalities, both a result of the
presence of poverty and of the introduction of policies to alle-
viate it.
