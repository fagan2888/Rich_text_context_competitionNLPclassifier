ERRATUM
In the article "The `Black Box' of Prescription Drug Diversion" by Inciardi et al., published in
Journal of Addictive Diseases 2009; 28(4), 332Â­347, errors occurred in the Delaware School Survey
data.
The needed corrections are in the second paragraph of the Discussion on page 343. The percent
should be corrected from 70% to 45%, and the word "street" immediately prior to dealers should be
removed, as some dealers were students. The correct sentence is "In addition, 45% of the Delaware
11th graders and 31% of the sex workers interviewed purchased prescription drugs from dealers."
