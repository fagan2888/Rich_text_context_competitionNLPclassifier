Introduction
The need for investigating change in society through mate-
rial culture such as vernacular architecture was emphasized
by Turan (1990). He posits that changing conditions and
variability remain one of the major characteristics of vernac-
ular architecture. This is based on the concept of cultural
change, which emphasizes the dynamism of culture in every
given society with time. In essence, the tendency to change
does not only depend on external forces acting on it, but is
inherent in any cultural system and affects all its forms of
material culture. The material culture being investigated here
is vernacular architecture. Rapoport and Hardie (1991) argue
that for vernacular architecture, the process of culture change
and associated changes to the built environment is dynamic,
so that the problem is to identify persisting traditional ele-
ments, as well as disappearing, changing, or new elements in
the built environment. Based on this concept, architecture is
subject to change not only by external influences but also by
its inherent tendency to do so.
As such, this article focuses on examining the extent to
which migration facilitates external influences and acts as an
agent of cultural change, bringing about architectural varia-
tions in dwellings from the same society. The results of this
research may not necessarily address the issue of change in a
way that is applicable to all vernacular environments, but it
can contribute to overall knowledge by addressing it from
the culture-specific viewpoint of Ijo migrant fishermen.
From a review on existing literature on variations in archi-
tecture, certain gaps and paucity of research were identified.
First, most of the studies on architectural variation are longitu-
dinal or chronological studies from a mixture of anthropology,
archaeology, and cultural geographical from an architectural
viewpoint, focusing on change in a single community over
time (Bailey, 1990; Cochrane, 2002; Dawson, 2001; Domenig,
1990; Gilman, 1987; Pfalzner, 1996; Rodman, 1985;
Rollefson, 1997; Romanou, 2007; Schwerdtfeger, 1982;
Watkins, 1996; Wills, 2001). However, only few studies have
actually examined the architectural variations of a group with
the same ethnic source but living in different locations due to
migration (Lawrence, 1987; Noussia, 2004; Pader, 1993). In
the few cases identified, the studies focused on analyzing

Base Camp Architecture: Examining
Variations in Fisher Dwellings in Nigeria
and Cameroon
Warebi Gabriel Brisibe1
Abstract
Longitudinal or time line studies of change in the architecture of a particular culture are common, but an area still open to
further research is change across space or place. In particular, there is need for studies on architectural change of cultures
stemming from the same ethnic source split between their homeland and other Diasporas. This change may range from
minor deviations to drastic shifts away from an architectural norm and the accumulation of these shifts within a time frame
constitutes variations. This article focuses on identifying variations in the architecture of the Ijo fishing group that migrates
along the coastline of West Africa. It examines the causes of cross-cultural variation between base camp dwellings of Ijo
migrant fishermen in the Bakassi Peninsula in Cameroon and Bayelsa State in Nigeria. The study draws on the idea of the
inevitability of cultural and social change over time as proposed in the theories of cultural dynamism and evolution. It tests
aspects of cultural transmission theory using the principal coordinates analysis to ascertain the possible causes of variation.
From the findings, this research argues that migration has enhanced the forces of cultural dynamism, which have resulted in
significant variations in the architecture of this fishing group.

domestic space in relation to social change, using primarily
qualitative methods to identify variations. But all three of
these previous studies fall short of investigating the causes of
these variations. Furthermore, only studies related to archaeol-
ogy employed the use of quantitative methods in analyzing
these architectural variations. This research is intended on tak-
ing a step further by investigating architectural variations and
their causes, for which quantitative and qualitative methods
have been used.
"Fishermen Without Borders"
Migration is a common socioeconomic activity in the life-
style of artisanal fishermen of Ijo ethnic origin. The Ijos are
one of 10 prominent migrant fishing tribes in the West
African subregion and the fourth largest ethnic group in
Nigeria. They migrate to different locations along the inshore
rivers and coastline of Nigeria and even beyond. This has
contributed in spreading their population among other
regions in Nigeria and Africa, although their ancestral home-
land is in the central Niger Delta area of Nigeria.
These fishermen embark on two forms of migration: the
first is an interregional and sometimes transnational form of
migration, where the fishermen relocate and become settlers
in other geographic regions or countries; and second, an
intersite or intraregional form of migration, where the fisher-
men carry out various short migratory or commuting trips
within the region they choose to settle during different fish-
ing seasons in the year. Some scholars refer to them as "inter-
national" and "internal" migrations. Openness of the borders
of the territorial waters between coastal countries in West
and Central Africa were identified as the key factor that
makes such international migration possible (Njock &
Westlund, 2008). In both forms of migration, residential
movement is involved. Often, one main dwelling along a
river route known as the base camp and a number of satellite
dwellings in offshore and inshore waters are established.
The other parts ofAfrica where Ijo fishermen have migrated
to include Benin republic (Olawepo, 2008); the Bakassi
Peninsula and Littoral regions of Cameroon (N. B. Leis, 1964,
P. E. Leis, 1972); the Lake Chad regions which border Nigeria,
and the Republic of Chad; and the coastal regions of Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo (Agoro, Asuk,
Olali, & Etekpe, 2009; Chauveau, 1991; Haakonsen, 1989; see
Figure 1). However, this article is narrowed down to the com-
parative analysis of the dwelling models in Bayelsa (Nigeria)
and Bakassi (Cameroon) only as shown on the map in Figure
2. Most of the current populations of Ijo fishermen in
Cameroon are descendants of these early settlers in Bakassi or
other regions in the Sud Ouest Province.
Fishermen and Migration in Nigeria
The term migrant fisherman was developed in Nigeria dur-
ing the early 1980s as research interests in coastal and inshore
fisheries grew. It became an official term used to describe the
fishing communities that were the focus of a government
research initiative. Part of the results of the study showed
that the fishermen and their families moved residence up to
an average of three locations a year according to seasons,
tides, and fish movements (Ezewu & Tahir, 1997). Figure 3
shows Ezewu and Tahir's model that explains the three loca-
tions fishermen reside in each season. These are the base
camps, offshore camps, and villages of origin.
The villages of origin are large settlements made up of
several clans or families. Although the base camps transit
settlements, they also serve as places of extended stay often
for considerable lengths of time. They are often established
to bring the fishermen closer to the fishing grounds. The off-
shore camps are seasonal sites with temporary homesteads
within or close to the fishing grounds and are not intended
for extended periods of stay or designed as such. In this
study, the focus is on the base camp as the primary settlement
from which architectural data are obtained.
Method
A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was
adopted for this study. For data collection, focus group dis-
cussions proved very useful at the base camps. The gathering
of all the household heads in a multi-homestead base camp
for discussions is a preexisting social practice which was
capitalized upon. The information derived from these group
discussions was often self-validating as any information
offered by a member was likely to be confirmed, corrected,
or refuted by others. Factual credibility rested on collective

Central African Countries.

memory which is essential for the narrative and descriptive
approaches used in studies of the vernacular environment.
Capturing different aspects of the vernacular environment,
from different views, and showing various building elements
and details for dichotomous (binary) data categorization
required the use of drawings and photographs.
To analyze the data, the use of coefficients for the purpose
of measuring similarity was adopted. A coefficient is a statis-
tical technique used in analyzing binary data in a matrix for-
mat that produces values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. Although
using coefficients to determine similarities is effective, it is,
however, not conclusive enough as it only shows similarities
but does not show whether the similarities are as a result of
same ancestry "branching" or borrowing from other cultures
"blending." As such, it is necessary to ascertain the type of
similarity using more graphical or diagrammatic methods
like the principal coordinate analysis (PCA). The XLSTAT
software, which is a form of multidimensional scaling, was
used. The end result is a simple graphical display of dots on
a two-dimensional scatter diagram. The position of these
dots would indicate the level of similarities and source of
variations between the dwellings of the different migrant
fishing groups in the Bakassi Peninsula.
The reason for adopting a combination of research meth-
ods is to first ascertain quantitatively the causes of variation
and then offer possible interpretations from qualitative data
for the reasons behind these variations.

Types of Base Camp Dwellings
A total of 74 fishing camps were visited for this study, 25 in
Bakassi and 49 in Bayelsa, the location of which are shown
on the maps in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. There are three
main types of base camp dwellings built by Ijo migrant fish-
ermen; these are the agbada ware (house on stilts) and the
atu or atuk ware (house on mud foundation). The third
type is simply a combination of features obtained from the
first two types. It is referred to as the agbada­atou mo ware
(stilt house with mud foundation). These building types are
distinguished by the materials used and construction meth-
ods used in their substructure. They form the basic base camp
typologies built by Ijo migrant fishermen in all locations they
migrate to. For example, both the migrant fishermen in
Bayelsa and in Bakassi build these dwelling types, but their
similarities are in the substructure only, aside from that there
may be variations.

Agbada Ware (House on Stilts)
The stilt house is the most prominent feature on the Ijo river-
ine landscape. It is built on the edge of the river for easy
access to the waterways and to fishing grounds. The dwell-
ings are erected on timber posts or stilts, which create a
raised platform providing protection from high tides and
floods that can reach heights of up to 2 m. Details are shown
below in Figure 6.
Ato
.uko ware (House on Mud-Foundation)
The main feature of the atouko ware is its elevated mud
foundation (see Figure 7). The term atouko is derived from
the Ijo word atou which means mud. The type of mud
referred to here is the chikoko mud. It is a mixture of clay soil
and dead vegetable matter, which makes it resilient to the
eroding effects of constantly flowing water.

House)
In this type of built form, a part of the foundation is erected
on stilts and the other part made up of compact and elevated

chikoko mud. This occurs when dwellings combine both liv-
ing/sleeping spaces and hearth spaces as shown in Figure 8
below. Another common practice is where a part of the build-
ing is sited on marshy land and the other part over water.
Migration and Theories of Change
Change can be identified in any cultural system, which is
made up of many subsystems. These include art, architecture,
folklore, and so on, all of which experience change. Several
studies carried out in this area have all attempted to answer
questions relating to variation or change. Such as, the extent of
this change and then if this change comes as a result of internal
(immanent) or external (externalistic) forces. As a result of
cultural dynamism, changes are bound to occur and the accu-
mulation of such changes over time constitutes variations.
Studies in this area suggest that there are two main mech-
anisms by which variation is produced in material culture:
variations generated as a result of copying or "Lateral bor-
rowing" of other ideas during the production process, and
variations produced from within the group by "cognitive
mechanisms." Both way, such changes could occur during
production and an accumulation of these could result in sig-
nificant variations. Lateral borrowing may or may not be
intentional but may arise via association with other groups.
Cognitive mechanisms are sometimes deliberate or erro-
neous modifications made to an original pattern that brings
about variations. They can also be innovations necessitated
by production of material culture in a different context or
through changing "worldviews" of the society in question.
Moreover, the change may come about as a response to new
challenges posed by a different climate or location (Gabora,
2000, 2004). But the main difference between the two mech-
anisms is that one is borrowed from neighboring groups and
the other is developed from within the group.
In relation to migration, this article examines how much
change can be attributed to cognitive mechanisms brought
about by the expansion or splitting of a society into daughter
populations during migration. Also, how much change can
be attributed to lateral borrowing of other cultural traits
from other groups encountered during migration? The for-
mer is known as phylogenesis or "branching" (Collard &
Shennan 2008; Gray, Greenhill, & Ross, 2007; Lipo,
O'Brien, Shennan, & Collard, 2006; Mace, Holden, &
Shennan, 2005), while the latter is referred to as ethnogen-
esis or "blending" (Diaw, 1992; P. D. Jordan, 2007; P. Jordan
& Shennan, 2009; Terrell, 1988, 2001).
This article shows how quantitative methods are used to
test the influence of immanent forces such as "phylogenesis
or branching" and/or externalistic forces such as "ethnogen-
esis or blending" in architectural variation. The aim is to
ascertain the effect of migration on the migrant fisher base
camp dwellings of the Ijo ethnic group in Bayelsa and
Bakassi.
Identifying Causes of Architectural
Variations Quantitatively
The study was initiated based on the supposition that issues
relating to migration could result in changes that constitute

significant variations between the dwelling models. These
changes may either be developed from within the society
itself or brought about by external influence from other
neighboring groups. In this research, four of the neighboring
fishing groups were selected for comparative study. The eth-
nic groups selected are the Ibibios, Andonis, Ilajes, and the
Urhobos, each of which has been known to live in the same
region as the Ijos at one point or the other during migration.
Also, these groups practice migrant fishing and build base
camp dwellings. Only architectural data involving external
features of the base camp dwellings which were collected
have been used. These external features or traits are required
to produce the dichotomous or binary data used in the statis-
tical analysis.
In addition to the architectural data obtained from the
neighboring ethnic groups, corresponding data from the
migrant fishing dwellings in Bayelsa state were also included.
The addition of these data was meant to serve two purposes:
first, to serve as a basis for comparison between the base
camp dwellings in the ethnic homeland and in Bakassi.
Second, it serves as a control to indicate whether any of the
other ethnic groups have any form of relatedness to the par-
ent Ijo ethnic group in Bayelsa, which could then suggest
phylogenetic (common ancestry) possibilities between them.
A list of all exterior features of base camp dwellings in
Bakassi and Bayelsa are presented as dichotomous data
below.
Dichotomous/Binary Data
The main architectural traits in the base camp dwellings are
listed from 1 through to 14, but there are subtraits as well.
These subtraits are known as multistate variables and have
been treated as individual traits. The digit "1" records that a
trait is present among a particular ethnic group, while "0"
records traits that are absent. The use of the "1" and "0" dig-
its are the reason this form of data are being referred to as
"Dichotomous" or simply "Binary" data (Shennan, 1997).
The building traits recorded include construction elements,
house components, or other associated features. This research
focuses on external features and as such does not consider
internal fixtures or furnishings.
Measuring Similarity: Coefficients and
Dichotomous Data
To represent the data in dichotomous or binary form, a total of
32 external architectural features or traits were first identified.
These traits are a compilation of the external features of base
camp dwellings in the Bakassi peninsula common to all the
five groups being compared, including the Ijos. There are a
number of techniques which can be used in analyzing dichot-
omous data to ascertain similarity between the groups. One of
such techniques is the coefficients. Shennan (1997) examines
the use of coefficients for the purpose of measuring similarity
and discusses the different types of coefficients that can be
used. However, in this study, coefficients will be used simply
to derive the matrix for the PCA, which is the quantitative
method required to analyze the data. The coefficients used are
the simple matching coefficient, the Jaccard coefficient, and
the alternative to the Jaccard coefficient.
The major point of variance between the first two coeffi-
cients is how negative matches are treated. Negative matches
occur when traits are absent in all cases. An example is the
negative match in Trait 12 (ii) of Table 1, where none of the
six individual ethnic groups possess the trait in question. For
the simple matching coefficient, the 1 and the 0 values are
equally important, which means that even if all the groups or
units indicate absence for a particular variable or trait, the
negative match still counts when compiling the matrix. It
suggests that similarity between groups (in this case, base
camp dwellings of different migrant fishing groups) can still
be determined by the joint absence of traits in or on them. In
the Jaccard coefficient, if the individuals all indicate absence
for a trait, then it is disregarded altogether, that is, the nega-
tive match does not count when compiling the matrix, further
suggesting that joint absence of traits does not indicate simi-
larity between the individuals being considered.
For deriving the coefficient,
a = positive match (joint presence)
b = positive­negative match (top presence, bottom
absence)
c = negative­positive match (top absence, bottom
presence)
d = negative match (joint absences)
For simple matching coefficient, it is calculated as follows:

For Jaccard coefficient, it is calculated as follows:

The alternative to the Jaccard coefficient is as follows:

All three methods of coefficients were used to calculate
for similarity measure and to see whether the results obtained
were comparatively similar. Table 2 shows the multistate
data being treated as mutually exclusive attributes and pre-
sented as individual variables.
Tables 3 and 4 exemplify how the matrices are developed
by counting positive matches (joint presence) indicated by
"a," mismatches (one presence, one absence) indicated by
"b" and "c," and negative matches (joint absences) indicated
by "d." This defines the mathematical functions a, b, c, and
d, respectively, which are then used to calculate the simple

matrices was taken and the results show a range of between
0.4 and more than 0.7. What this means is that for any coef-
ficient below the threshold of 0.4, which bears less than half
the attributes of the other tribe, there are lesser possibilities
of borrowing or ethnic blending due to fewer similarities
between the two groups being compared. But for coeffi-
cients with values of more than 0.7, it shows that there are
stronger possibilities of borrowing or ethnic blending, due
to more similarities between the two groups in question.
Coefficients with values of 0.5 to 0.6 where half the attri-
butes are shared are inconclusive.

diagrams that indicate similarities between the ethnic groups,

were used in this analysis, and these are the matrices of the
simple matching coefficient, the Jaccard coefficient, and the
alternative to the Jaccard coefficient. The three different matri-
ces were analyzed separately to see whether the results of the
various scattergrams they generate would be similar.
The scatter diagram or scattergram is a simple two-
dimensional representation of the results with the ethnic
groups indicated as dots in the space. The distance between
these dots on the scatter diagram represents the similarity
between the ethnic groups. The scattergram is divided into
four quadrants by the two axes F1 and F2. The dots, or in
this case ethnic groups, which are seen to cluster within a
particular quadrant with the shortest distances between
them are regarded as those that bare the strongest similari-
ties. The axes can also be seen as dividing the space into
two halves: the left and right halves and the top and bottom
halves. The dots (groups) that conglomerate or cluster on a
particular side of the halves can also be interpreted as hav-
ing some form of similarity although not as strong as when
the dots (groups) cluster within a particular quadrant. The
dots positioned across diagonally or farthest from each
other are the most dissimilar of all the groups.
The values obtained from the coefficients was used to
generate values for the four coordinate points for the PCA
shown in Tables 9 to 11, which is then used to plot the
scattergrams shown below in Figures 9 to 11, revealing the
position of the dots (groups) on the diagram.

Discussion on Matrix of Coefficients
and PCA
The interpretation of the results obtained from the matrix of
coefficient is as follows: For any coefficient below the
threshold of 0.5, in which a group bears less than half the
attributes of the other group, it suggests that there are fewer
similarities between both groups. But for coefficients with
values of more than 0.7, it shows that there are strong
similarities between the two groups (see Tables 1 and 2).
This result does not indicate whether the two groups share a
common ancestry (branching) or whether borrowing (blend-
ing) occurs between them. To ascertain whether the similari-
ties are due to "blending" or "branching," the PCA was used
and the result was represented in two-dimensional scatter
diagrams or scattergrams.
Interpretation of Scatter Diagram
Generated From All Three Coefficient
Matrices
Based on the simple matching coefficient where negative
matches are considered, the list should show that t3 (Ibibio),
t4 (Andoni), and t6 (Urhobo) are the groups with the stron-
gest similarities in terms of external architectural features in
their base camp buildings. This is supported by the clustering
of the points within the bottom-right quadrant in the scatter-
gram. This only partly supports the results of the simple
matching coefficient by indicating strong similarities
between t4 (Andoni) and t6 (Urhobo), as the distance
between these two points is the shortest. However, the fact
that negative matches have been considered in the build-up
to this scatter diagram has clearly had an effect on the result.
The scatter diagram derived from the alternative to
Jaccard Coefficient matrix is similar to that derived from
the Jaccard Coefficient matrix, in that, it also disregards
negative matches. The results are similar as the distance
between points (groups) t2, t1, t4, and t6 are closer together
than t5 and t3. But more specifically, the space between t2
and t1, and t2 and t6 are equidistant, which suggests that t2
(Ijos in Bakassi) bares strong similarities to both t1 (Ijos in
Bayelsa) and t6 (Urhobos). This supports the initial find-
ings that phylogenetic or branching forces exist between t1
and t2, while ethnogenetic or blending forces exist between

t2 and t6. However, the distance between t1 (Ijos in Bayelsa)
and t6 (Urhobos) is far apart, suggesting that similarities
between these two groups are not strong, which reduces the
possibility of common ancestry between the Ijo (Bayelsa)
and Urhobo.
The results from the scattergram show that the strongest
similarities exist between the external architectural features
of the Ijo migrant fisher dwellings in Bakassi (T2) and those
of their Urhobo (T6) neighbors. Similarities between the Ijo
and the Urhobos in Bakassi show that there are variations
between the Ijos and their parent group in Bayelsa (T1).
However, because the similarities between the Ijos and
Urhobos are only in external architectural traits, it means that
the PCA analysis has only revealed external similarities and
not internal ones. The fact that stronger similarities exist
between these two groups, amid all the other groups in
Bakassi that have same levels of proximity to the Ijo migrant
fishers, raises questions as to why this is the case. Responses
from interviews suggest a number of possible reasons that
could have fostered this selective ethnogenetic activity.
Although, results show no indications of both groups
sharing a common ancestry, the data obtained from respon-
dents during fieldwork confirm that a stronger level of busi-
ness relationship and proximity exists between the Urhobo
and Ijo migrant fishermen. Over the years, fishermen of the
Urhobo group migrate into inshore brackish water regions
dominated by Ijo tribes to carry out fishing activities. They
are the only non-Ijo group allowed to operate within the
inshore territorial waters of the region while other tribes
within the region are limited to the marine or offshore waters.
However, it shows that there has been increased proximity
and relations due to migration between the Urhobo and the
Ijo migrant fishermen. The evidence suggests that these
increased relations have led to possible "blending" activities
between the two groups.
Conclusion
The PCA analysis therefore reveals that one of the causes of
variations between the Ijo base camp dwellings in Bakassi
and Bayelsa is ethnogenesis, due to the Ijos in Bakassi bor-
rowing cultural traits from the Urhobos, whom they had
more contact with during migration. However, it is important
to note that the traits borrowed from their neighboring group
relates more to building components and external architec-
tural features as listed in Table 1 and not to spatial configura-
tion. Of these two aspects, the PCA only revealed the source
of the exterior variations. Because the PCA analysis was
based on data obtained from only external architectural fea-
tures of all the groups, the results cannot be used to explain
variations in the spatial configurations of the dwellings.
Furthermore, from Table 1, the data show that the use of
connecting walkways to indicate kinship ties and the use of
living areas were used only by Ijos in Bakassi, which sug-
gests that some of the architectural traits were not borrowed
but are a result of cognitive mechanisms. This means that in
addition to lateral borrowing of traits, variations in Ijo base
camp dwellings in Bakassi also resulted from cognitive
mechanisms which are modifications made by successive
generations of fishermen over the years. So based on the
empirical evidence, the conclusions drawn from this
research is that causes of variations in Ijo migrant fisher
architecture can be traced to two sources or factors: lateral
borrowing of traits from neighboring groups as well as mod-
ifications due to cognitive mechanisms made by the Ijos in
Bakassi over time.
As such, the study supports findings of past works by
Sorokin (1985) who argued that change is determined not
only by external circumstances but also by the nature of the
system itself. It also supports the claims by Diaw (1992) on
how ethnogenesis influences lateral borrowing among
migrant fishing groups. In addition, we could also deduce
from the findings that similarities in base camp dwelling
designs, due to possible lateral borrowing between Ijos and
Urhobos in Bakassi, are not a function of language similarity.
This supports the claims made by Welsch, Terrell, and
Nadolski (1992) that there are no associations between simi-
larity of material culture and language, than those made by
Roberts, Moore, and Romney (1995) who suggest that there
is such an association. Finally, the result showing notable
variations between base camp designs challenges the previ-
ous hypothesis made by Hollos (1989) that no evident change
in culture, livelihood, and behavior was observed from those
who had settled in the Cameroons over the years.
This study does not totally attribute change or architec-
tural variations solely to migration; it, however, shows how
migration acts as an agent of contact and communication
between different groups. It is this contact that inevitably
results in cross-pollination of social and material cultural
traits between neighboring groups and one of such material
culture is vernacular architecture.
