Objective To assess rates of overweight/obesity and related health behaviors among rural and urban chil-
dren using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods Data
were drawn from the 2003­2004 and 2005­2006 NHANES surveys regarding demographic characteristics,
weight status, dietary behaviors and physical activity behaviors. Results Significantly more rural children
were found to be obese than urban children. Health behavior differences to explain this differential obesity
rate were primarily not significant, but multivariate analyses indicate that for rural children meeting physical
activity recommendations is protective and engaging in more than 2 hr/day of electronic entertainment pro-
motes obesity. Conclusions There are modifiable health behavior differences between rural and urban
children which may account for the significantly higher obesity rates among rural children.

Introduction
Pediatric overweight is often cited as the most pressing
health problem among today's children (Robinson, 2008).
Obesity is considered an important pediatric health issue
because child weight status is directly related to adult health
status, independent of adult weight status (Dietz, 1998). In
other words, if an individual is overweight as a child, even if
they lose weight prior to adulthood, being overweight as a
child can result in many negative health outcomes such as
diabetes, heart disease, orthopedic issues, and sleep diffi-
culties (Must & Strauss, 1999). Children who are over-
weight or obese are also likely to remain obese as adults
(Guo et al., 2000) and have increased rates of psychosocial
problems, such as poor quality of life (Zeller, Roehrig, Modi,
Daniels, & Inge, 2006), poor body image (Israel & Ivanova,
2002), and social problems (Janssen, Craig, Boyce, &
Pickett, 2004). Recent economic data indicate that
overweight/obesity costs the U.S. healthcare system over
$100 billion dollars annually (Overweight and obesity for
professionals: Economic consequences, 2009).
In June 2007, the Expert Committee on Pediatric
Obesity changed terminology, such that children with a
Body Mass Index (BMI) at or between the 85th and 94th
percentiles are now considered ``overweight,'' and children
with a BMI percentile at or above the 95th are now con-
sidered ``obese'' (Barlow & The Expert Committee, 2007).
Recent data indicate that prevalence of pediatric overweight
and obesity continue to rise both in the United States and
around the world (World Health Organization Obesity and
Overweight Fact Sheet, 2010).
There are certain groups of children who are more
likely to have difficulties with pediatric overweight, includ-
ing African American teenage girls, Hispanic teenage boys,
and children whose parents are obese (Winkleby,

Robinson, Sundquist, & Kraemer, 1999). Some data also
indicate that living in a rural community increases one's
risk of overweight or obesity. For example, Davy Harrell,
Stewart, & King (2004) conducted a study of body weight
status, dietary habits, and physical activity levels among
middle-school children in rural Mississippi (Davy et al.,
2004). Data from 205 children indicate 54% had a BMI
over the 85th percentile, they consumed 34% of their cal-
ories from fat (30% or fewer are recommended), and en-
gaged in approximately 9,000 steps per day (10,000 or
more steps are recommended). Unfortunately, no matched
urban group was included making comparison between
urban and rural children difficult. In a similar study with
54 Appalachian Kentucky elementary school children, an-
other group found that 33% of rural children had a BMI
over the 85th percentile, they consumed 36% of their cal-
ories from fat and engaged in over 3 hr of screen time (TV/
video/computer play) on average per day (Crooks, 2000). It
is problematic to draw conclusions from such a small
sample from a single rural region. However, similar results
have been found for African American children from rural
South Carolina (Felton et al., 1998), and for fourth grade
children from rural central Iowa (Gustafson-Larson &
Terry, 1992). Although these studies are consistent, they
lack a nationally representative sample of urban and rural
children obtained simultaneously which would allow for
assessment of the relationship between overweight/obesity,
health behaviors and rural/urban status. Such national
studies have been conducted with adults and consistently
indicate that overweight (Jackson, Doescher, Jerant, &
Hart, 2005; Patterson, Moore, Probst, & Shinogle, 2004)
and overweight-related health behaviors (i.e., excess calo-
ries, decreased physical activity; Martin et al., 2005) are
more common among rural adults than urban adults.
Rural Healthy People 2010 suggests that there may be
``cultural'' and ``structural'' limitations specific to rural
areas that may impact the prevalence of overweight/obesity
(Tai-Seale & Chandler, 2003). ``Cultural'' tendencies im-
plicated include higher dietary fat and calorie consumption
in rural areas, lower rates of exercise, higher rates of screen
time (TV, video, and computer play), and lack of adequate
health education. The ``structural'' causes include lack of
nutrition education, poor access to nutritionists, limited
resources, and fewer outlets for exercise. Demographic fac-
tors also play a role. Rural individuals are typically poorer
and have less education than their urban counterparts, two
factors that have been shown to be positively associated
with higher rates of overweight.
Despite these compelling data, to date, there have
been no national studies of the rates of pediatric over-
weight/obesity and related health behaviors with rural
and urban children. The objective of the current study
was to assess overweight/obesity and overweight/
obesity-related health behaviors among rural and urban
children using data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES is a
national survey conducted biannually to provide a snap-
shot of the health and nutrition of the U.S. population. As
such, it is an ideal source of data given the objective of the
current study. Based upon previous data, we hypothesize
that children in rural areas will have higher rates of over-
weight and obesity, will have different dietary composition,
and will have lower rates of physical activity when com-
pared with urban children.
Methods
Data for this analysis were drawn from the 2003­2004 and
2005­2006 NHANES. The NHANES is an ongoing survey
of the general U.S. population conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics within the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. NHANES participants undergo a
survey as well as a medical examination that includes blood
work and measured height and weight. Responses to ques-
tions were obtained directly from those aged 16 years or
older; all others were obtained from the parent or guardian.
We used two cycles of NHANES data to ensure ade-
quate sample sizes for analysis, for a total of 7,882 partic-
ipants aged 2­18 years. We then used the weights, strata,
and primary sampling units provided by the NHANES data
to weigh the data to provide representative estimates of the
U.S. population at large, resulting in a weighted sample
size of 138,345,314.
Variable Definitions
Overweight/Obesity
The main variable of interest, weight status, was defined
according to the CDCs age- and gender-specific percentile
ranks for BMI. Three measures were used in this analysis;
overweight was defined as an age and gender BMI equal to or
greater than the 85th and below the 95th percentile; obese
was defined as an age and gender specific BMI equal to or
above the 95th percentile; overweight/obese was defined as
an age and gender BMI greater than the 85th percentile.
Residence
Each participant's county of residence's rural status was
classified according to its urban influence code (UIC), es-
tablished by the USDA (Economic Research Service). These
codes are drawn from the 2005 Area Resource file, which
maintains information regarding the characteristics of the
3,142 counties in the United States (DHHS, Area
670 Davis, Bennett, Befort, and Nollen
Resource File, 2008). If UIC Codes were 1 or 2, then the
county was coded as Urban while all other UIC codes (3­
12--known as ``nonmetropolitan codes'' by the USDA
Economic Research Service) were classified as Rural (Liu,
Bennett, Harun, & Probst, 2008).
Physical Activity
The CDC recommends that children and adolescents aged
6­17 years should participate in at least 60 min of activity
per day, and vigorous activity several days per week
(Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2009). The
NHANES questions are not structured, however, to deter-
mine if the participants met these recommendations.
Therefore, for children aged 2­11 years, we classified
those who answered the question ``How many times per
week does ____ play or exercise enough to make {him/
her} sweat and breathe hard?'' as three or more times to be
in compliance with the recommendations. For those aged
12­18 years old, we utilized the Physical Activity
Individual Activities data file. This survey component
asked participants to choose from a list of activities those
they participate in on a regular basis, the number of times
they performed the activity during the past 30 days, and
the average number of minutes each activity is performed
per session. These responses were summed by participant
and averaged over the 30 day period to obtain an estimate
of daily activity level. Those who averaged 60 min of activity
per day, based upon these responses, were classified as
meeting the physical activity recommendations.
Dietary intake
Dietary intake was defined using the mean estimated daily
intake in seven categories; fruits/vegetables, sugar-
sweetened beverages, milk products, fried foods, meat,
added fats, and desserts/sweets. Parents were asked to
report the number of items consumed in a typical day by
their child. These answers were then aggregated and esti-
mated daily frequencies were computed.
Socioeconomic status
Socioeconomic status was defined using the federal poverty
level percentage, grouped by each NHANES year's tertile,
to provide low-, middle-, and high-socioeconomic status
designations.
Electronic entertainment
Electronic entertainment was defined as more than 2 hr
spent, per day, watching television, using computers, or
playing video games for entertainment purposes. Other
variables utilized in the analysis included age, race,
gender, and the presence of any physical limitations that
would affect activity levels.
Analytic Plan
The proportion of participants who were overweight/obese
was calculated, subset by the variables detailed above.
These proportions were further subset by residence (rural
vs. urban), with differences tested using chi-squared. The
bivariate analyses indicated potential interactions between
race, gender, and age, which were included in the multi-
variate logistic models. The multivariate logistic models
used obesity status as the dependent variable, while con-
trolling for race, gender, age group (2­11 vs. 12­18 years),
socioeconomic status, physical activity, dietary intake, use
of electronic entertainment, and physical activity limita-
tions. We conducted two sets of multivariable logistic re-
gression models to determine the factors related to obesity
among rural and urban populations. The initial models
utilized a dichotomous obesity indicator variable for the
dependent variable, and included all of the above intend-
ment variables. This model was performed on two subpop-
ulations; rural only and urban only. The final models were
also subset to the two subpopulations (rural only and
urban only), and only included those independent vari-
ables that that were significant in the full model at
p < .10. All analyses were conducted using SAS-Callable
SUDAAN (Proc Crosstab, Proc Descript, and Proc
Multilog) to take into account the complex sampling struc-
ture of the NHANES data.
Results
A total of 7,882 unweighted subjects in this analysis rep-
resented more than 138 million weighted, nationally rep-
resentative individuals. Overall, nearly 16% lived in rural
areas, and the sample was predominately White (See
Table I for demographic information). Rural residents dif-
fered significantly from urban residents on most key demo-
graphic characteristics (gender, race, age, and SES; see
Table I).
The unadjusted analyses indicate that overall, 33.1%
of the sample was overweight/obese; 15.4% were over-
weight while 17.7% were obese (see Table II). Breaking
the sample down by rural/urban status, 39.0% of the
rural children were over the 85th percentile, whereas
32.0% of the urban children were over the 85th percentile.
This difference did not reach statistical significance.
Looking at categories of overweight versus obese, signifi-
cantly more rural children were obese (21.8%) compared
to urban children (16.9%). Other factors significantly as-
sociated with weight status included gender, race, age, and
socioeconomic status.
Rural Urban Childhood Obesity Behaviors 671
Analyses were then conducted to learn more about
specific health behavior differences that may be associated
with weight status for rural and urban children. For these
analyses, initial modeling revealed healthy and overweight
(not obese) children had no differences between rural and
urban areas regarding specific health behaviors, so those
groups were collapsed and the groups analyzed were:
(a) obese versus and (b) healthy weight and overweight
(groups collapsed). Activity variables (Table III) included
meeting physical activity guidelines and more than 2 hr/day
using electronic entertainment were not significantly differ-
ent between rural and urban children. When these were
broken down by obese (BMI > 95th) versus nonobese,
however, we found that significantly more nonobese chil-
dren met physical activity guidelines as compared to obese
children, both in urban (67.4 vs. 62.4, p < .05) and rural
(67.1 vs. 57.4, p < .05) areas. The same held true for the
use of electronic entertainment, in that significantly more
obese children used electronic entertainment for more than
2 hr/day as compared to non-obese children, both in urban
(67.6 vs. 62.2, p < .05) and rural (69.0 vs. 63.1, p < .05)
areas.
Regarding dietary variables, there were no urban­rural
differences in mean intakes of any of the dietary intake
categories (Table III). Overall, both urban and rural obese
children were more likely to drink more sugar-sweetened
beverages. Urban obese children consumed more meat and
desserts on a daily basis than nonobese urban children,
and among urban children obese were less likely to con-
sume sweets than nonobese.
The multivariate analysis showed, after controlling for
the independent variables, few factors remained significant
predictors of obesity, and that the factors differed for rural
children compared to urban children (See Table IV).
Among rural children, the significant factors related to obe-
sity included race (African American children were more
likely to be overweight than White children), meeting phys-
ical activity recommendations [Odds Ratio (OR) ¼ 0.70,
95% CI 0.49­0.99], and electronic entertainment use
greater than 2 hr/day (OR ¼ 1.42, 95% CI 1.04­1.95).
Among urban children, the factors significantly related to
obesity included race (again, with African American chil-
dren were more likely to be obese than White children),
age (children less than 10 years old were less likely to be
obese), socioeconomic status (those in families with
middle incomes were more likely to be obese than those
with high incomes), and dietary intake (more average daily
consumption of meat and sugar-sweetened beverages was
associated with being obese).
Conclusions
This study sought to examine the rate of overweight and
obesity among rural and urban children, and to determine
which specific health behaviors contributed to any existing
differences. We found that rural children were significantly

more likely to be obese than urban children--a finding that
has consistently been found in regional rural obesity stud-
ies (Crooks, 2000; Davy et al., 2004; Felton et al., 1998;
Gustafson-Larson & Terry, 1992), and in other national
studies with adults (Jackson et al., 2005; Martin et al.,
2005; Patterson et al., 2004). Nearly 22% of rural children
in our sample were classified as obese, compared to only
17% of urban children. In terms of treatment options, this
finding is especially problematic, given that so many rural
areas are designated as healthcare provider shortage areas
as well (Health Resources Services Administration, n.d.). If
there are more children in rural areas in need of treatment,
how are we to get empirically supported programs out
to them? There have been some novel uses of technology
such as interactive televideo (Davis et al., 2011) and other
outreach programs (Janicke et al., 2010) that may be
helpful, but this is definitely an area in need of further
attention.
Few of the major health behaviors that were measured
in the study demonstrated any significant differences be-
tween rural and urban children that would account for the
differential obesity rates. The two groups of children had
similar rates of meeting physical activity recommendations,
similar rates of electronic entertainment use, and similar
rates of consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. It is
important to note, however, that there are more methodo-
logically rigorous assessment methods available (i.e., phys-
ical activity monitors, 24 hr dietary recalls) that may be
more sensitive than the self-report measures used by
NHANES. Other studies utilizing these rigorous
assessment methods among smaller samples have found
health behavior differences among urban and rural children
(Davis et al., 2008).
The current data do show that there are health behav-
ior differences between obese and nonobese children in the
expected direction. For example, nonobese children were
significantly more likely to meet physical activity guide-
lines, and significantly less likely to engage in more than
2 hr of electronic entertainment. Regarding dietary vari-
ables, obese children consumed significantly more
sugar-sweetened beverages than nonobese children. Like
adult findings (Davies et al., 2000), our data do indicate
that drinking milk had a protective effect, but this only
reached statistical significance for rural children, possibly
due to their slightly higher milk consumption.
One surprising finding was that urban children who
were not obese consumed significantly more sweets than
urban children who were obese. Interestingly, this same
pattern of higher sweets consumption among the nonobese
was observed for rural children as well, but did not reach
statistical significance. Looking at the methodology for the
NHANES survey, dietary information is based upon parent
report. There is some literature to suggest that weight
status of underreporters is significantly higher than that
of plausible reporters (Ventura, Loken, Mitchell,
Smickilas-Wright, & Birch, 2006) suggesting that our re-
sults could be due to underreporting. Further research is
needed to clarify this issue.
The multivariate models showed that for rural children
obesity was highly related to race (African American), not

Rural Urban Childhood Obesity Behaviors 673
meeting physical activity recommendations, and use of
electronic entertainment for more than 2 hr/day. This indi-
cates that among rural children activity and the lack thereof
may be key in combating obesity in children. However,
among urban children, obesity was related to race
(African American), age (children less than 10 years of
age were less likely to be overweight/obese), socioeconomic
status (high-income children were less likely to be over-
weight/obese), and higher dietary intake (specifically re-
garding meats and sugar-sweetened beverages). Therefore,
among urban children physical activity and sedentary ac-
tivity variables may be less important shifting the focus to
dietary interventions possibly focusing on meats and
sugar-sweetened beverages.
This study is an improvement over previous studies
because we used NHANES data, which provides a nation-
ally representative sample of rural and urban children.
Also, NHANES physically measures a child's height and
weight to calculate BMI; other studies have used data
sets that depended upon parental report for height and
weight (Tai-Seale & Chandler, 2003). The results, however,
are similar enough to lend credence to the previous work,
and to bolster the evidence of a rural difference in obesity
prevalence among children.
Our study has several limitations. Although we pooled
two waves of NHANES data, we were still limited by rela-
tively small rural sample sizes that reduced our ability to
detect significant differences among groups and factors.
Also, many of the health behaviors (such as physical activ-
ity data) depended upon respondent recall and estimation,
and are subject to recall bias. We chose to use the frequen-
cy measures of dietary intake rather than dietary recall in-
formation, despite it being present for a majority of the
children in the sample, due to the nature in which the
recall data were collected. For those aged 6 years and
under, a proxy (usually a parent or guardian) recalled the

child's dietary info; for those aged 6­11 years, the recall
was facilitated; and for those aged 12 years and over, the
recall was performed with the child, independently.
Previous research has indicated that these types of source
differences can significantly affect outcome (Savage,
Mitchell, Smiciklas-Wright, Symons Downs, & Birch,
2008; Huang, Howarth, Lin, Roberts, & Mcrory, 2004).
The data used are also quite dated, being from 2003 to
2006 and we also chose to collapse several categories of
rural (UIC codes 3­12) in our analyses, which has been
done previously but does not allow for assessment of the
nuances of different levels of rurality. Finally, combining
the physical activity data for children aged 2­11 years of
age with the data for children aged 12­18 years despite the
different methodology used with each age group is a
limitation.
The current study provides evidence that rural chil-
dren and adolescents are at higher risk for obesity than
their urban counterparts. The results also demonstrate
that it is not living in a rural area in and of itself that
leads to this increased prevalence. Rather, the factors that
differ between urban and rural residents, such as socioeco-
nomic status, and prevalence of physical limitations, con-
tribute significantly to the weight differences. These
findings support the notion that interventions aimed at
improving these factors are needed in rural areas to
combat the significantly higher rates of pediatric obesity.
The current study also raises several areas in need of
further study. First, our study did not find any significant
health behavior differences between rural and urban chil-
dren. Using stronger methodology (such as three 24-hr
dietary recalls, 7-day activity monitor counts) and a more
appropriately powered sample, may allow the sensitivity
and statistical power to detect any differences that exist.
Second, the finding that drinking milk had a protective
effect, but only for rural children, bears further study, as
does the finding that urban children who were not obese
consumed more sweets than urban children who were
obese. Finally, our multivariate findings that physical activ-
ity variables may be more important for rural children and
dietary variables may be more important for urban children
have direct implications for the development of treatment
interventions targeting pediatric obesity among rural and
urban children.
