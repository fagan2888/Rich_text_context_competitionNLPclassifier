ABSTRACT
Objectives: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is
increasingly recognized among overweight adolescents.
Metabolic syndrome often coexists with NAFLD in adults.
This study aimed to determine whether, in US adolescents,
metabolic syndrome increases the odds of alanine amino-
transferase (ALT) >40 U/L, a surrogate for NAFLD.
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study of the
association between metabolic syndrome and ALT>40 U/L
was undertaken in a sample of 12- to 19-year-olds from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 to
2002, representative of the US adolescent population. Subjects
were excluded for incomplete data, pregnancy, steroid or
hepatotoxic drug use, cholestasis or viral hepatitis, and
alcohol intake. The metabolic syndrome was defined by adult
criteria adapted for pediatric body size and blood pressure. The
association of metabolic syndrome with ALT>40U/L, effect
modifiers, and confounders were analyzed using National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey sampling weights.
Results: Of 4902 adolescents, the 1323 included were similar to
the excluded ones, except for the important variable sex (55% vs
49% male, P ¼ 0.03, respectively). The metabolic syndrome
was associated with ALT>40 U/L (odds ratio [OR] 16.7,
confidence interval [CI] 6.2­45.1, P < 0.001) with significant
interaction by sex: OR 20.4 (CI 6.2­66.7, P < 0.001) for males
versus 3.1 (CI 0.4­25.1, P ¼ 0.3) for females. Further
stratification of males suggested interaction by ethnicity: OR
5.0 (CI 1.3­19.0, P ¼ 0.02) for Hispanics versus 34.3 (CI 7.61­
55.4, P < 0.001) for non-Hispanics. Among Hispanic males,
adjustment for body mass index z score explained the
association (OR 0.6; CI 0.1­2.9, P ¼ 0.5), whereas among
non-Hispanic males, the association remained after adjustment
for BMIz (OR 11.1; CI 3.2­38.0, P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with
ALT>40U/L in US male adolescents. Body mass index z score
explained this association among Hispanics, but not among non-
Hispanic males. Significant sex and ethnic differences exist in the
association of pediatric metabolic syndrome with elevated ALT.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a spectrum
of hepatic disease involving fatty infiltration of the liver,
is emerging as a serious pediatric problem, mainly among
overweight preadolescents and adolescents. Nonalco-
holic fatty liver disease is a histological diagnosis made
by liver biopsy, typically in a person with elevated
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) after exclusion of other
causes of liver disease. Although simple steatosis or
increased hepatocellular fat deposition may be benign,
its more complex form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), which is characterized by inflammation, bal-
looning degeneration, and fibrosis may progress to
chronic, irreversible liver disease, even during childhood
(1). The prevalence of NAFLD in US adults is estimated
to be 2.8% to 24% among all adults (2­4) and 5.5%
to 75% among obese adults (2,4). The prevalence of
NAFLD in children is largely unknown. One estimate
derived from autopsy data in San Diego County found
that 9.6% of all children and 38% of obese children who
died of unnatural causes had histological fatty liver (5).
Another estimate on the basis of a representative sample

of US adolescents from the third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988­
1994), was that 3.2% of adolescents overall had elevated
ALT (>30 U/L), as a surrogate for NAFLD, including
10% of overweight (body mass index [BMI] >95th
percentile), and 1.5% of healthy weight adolescents
(odds ratio [OR] 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]
3.5­12.8) (6).
The metabolic syndrome, a phenotypic marker of
insulin resistance and increased risk for cardiovascular
disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, often coexists with
NAFLD among adults. In adults, the metabolic syndrome
has been defined by criteria established by 3 different
authorities: the National Cholesterol Education Panel:
Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) (7), the World Health
Organization (8), and the International Diabetes Federa-
tion (9). In the United States, the metabolic syndrome is
estimated to be present in 22% of adults (10) and 4% of
adolescents overall, with 28% among overweight and
0.1% among normal-weight adolescents (11). The ado-
lescent data, however, are limited by inconsistent adap-
tations of adult metabolic syndrome definitions to the
pediatric population and lack of a pediatric specific
consensus definition (11­16).
The association between metabolic syndrome and
NAFLD has been well described in adults (17­21) and
in a limited number of non-nationally representative
pediatric studies (22­24). Among adult participants of
NHANES III (1988­1994), those with metabolic syn-
drome had 4-fold increased odds of having elevated ALT
compared with those without metabolic syndrome (25).
Clinical experience and limited pediatric data suggest a
similar association between metabolic syndrome and
elevated ALT in adolescents. However, this specific
association has not been clearly established in studies
of ethnically diverse US adolescents, who present with
many phenotypical differences from adults. The aim of
this study was to test, in a nationally representative and
multiethnic sample of US adolescents, the hypothesis that
adolescents with the metabolic syndrome are 4 or more
times more likely to have ALT>40 U/L, as a surrogate
for NAFLD, compared with adolescents without the
metabolic syndrome. The directionality and magnitude
of this hypothesis were based on estimates from the adult
literature (25), the lower limit of the CI found in the
Strauss et al study (6), and what the investigators con-
sidered a priori as clinically significant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This cross-sectional study evaluated a nationally represen-
tative sample of adolescents living in the United States between
1999 and 2002, who participated in the NHANES 1999­2002.
NHANES includes in-person interviews, physical examina-
tion, and laboratory testing. Participants are sampled using
a stratified, multistage, probability sampling method with
over-sampling of low-income families, adolescents, blacks,
and Mexican Americans. Subjects included in this study were
12 through 19 years of age, with available anthropometric,
relevant questionnaire, and fasting (>8 hours) laboratory data.
Subjects were excluded for lack of data for any of the 5 meta-
bolic syndrome components, hepatitis B surface antigen or
hepatitis C antibody positivity, total bilirubin >1.5 mg/dL,
current use of systemic steroids or any potentially hepatotoxic
medications, any past or current alcohol use, or pregnancy. This
study was exempted from review by The Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia institutional review board. The original NHANES
research protocol was approved by a human subjects review
board and written informed consent was obtained from all
subjects 18 years of age or older or from a parent/legal guardian
of subjects younger than 18 years. Written assent was also
obtained from adolescents younger than 18 years.
Interview data included age, sex, ethnicity/race, household
income, number of household members, alcohol intake, medi-
cation history, hepatitis A vaccine status, and dietary intake
(26). Ethnicity and race were determined from a series of
questions that began by asking subjects to identify their national
origin as Mexican American, other Hispanic, both Mexican and
other Hispanic, or not Hispanic. Then, subjects were asked
to identify their race as American Indian/Alaska Native,
Asian Black/African American, native Hawaiian/other Pacific
Islander, White, or Other. Because the literature has suggested
that both metabolic syndrome (11) and NAFLD (27,28) are
more common in people of Hispanic ethnicity, an interaction by
Hispanic ethnicity in the association between metabolic syn-
drome and elevated ALT was hypothesized and thus ethnicity/
race was dichotomized into Hispanic and non-Hispanic. The
poverty­income ratio (PIR) (29), calculated as household
income divided by poverty threshold, with a maximum value
of 5, was used as a continuous variable from 0 to 5. A PIR 1
indicated poverty and a PIR >1 indicated nonpoverty (29).
Alcohol intake data were collected via self-administered com-
puter questionnaire with subjects, isolated from study staff and
family members, being asked to identify at what age they had
their first alcoholic drink. Only subjects who reported never
drinking alcohol were included. Those who reported any intake
and those who did not answer this question were excluded.
Dietary fat and energy intake were measured from a 24-hour
dietary recall performed either in-person at the time of health
interview or over the telephone, 4 to 10 days later. Total dietary
fat was transformed into percent of total energy from fat using
the formula: ([{fat, g} Â {9 kcal/g}/{total kcal}] Â 100).
Physical examination data included body weight, standing
height, and abdominal waist circumference at the level of the
ileac crest (30). Body mass index was calculated using the
standard formula: ([body weight, kg]/[height, m2]). Weight,
height, and BMI were converted into z scores and percentiles for
sex and age using the LMS method (31) and the pediatric
anthropometric references from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention growth charts (32,33). Waist circumference
measurements were classified as above or below the 90th
percentile according to age- and sex-specific references derived
from NHANES III (34). One to 4 blood pressure (BP) measure-
ments were obtained manually with a sphygmomanometer
according to the 1993 American Heart Association blood
pressure­measuring guidelines (30,35). Mean systolic blood
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were

calculated by omitting the first reading and averaging the
remaining values or using 1 reading if only 1 was available.
Each average was then converted into a z score and percentile
for age, sex, and height, as well as categorized as above/equal to
or below the 95th percentile using standard reference data and
equations (36).
Blood samples for ALT (U/L), total bilirubin (mg/dL),
fasting glucose (mg/dL), fasting triglyceride (TG) (mg/dL),
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (mg/dL), anti-
hepatitis C antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen were
collected and analyzed by standard laboratory methods (37).
Random urine samples of all females were collected and tested
qualitatively for human chorionic gonadotropin with all positive
pregnancy tests confirmed by serum testing (37).
Metabolic syndrome was defined using the National
Cholesterol Education Program ATP III criteria (7), with
2 adaptations for a pediatric population: the waist circumfer-
ence and BP cutoffs were based on pediatric-specific reference
data (Table 1) (34,36). There is currently no universally
accepted pediatric definition of metabolic syndrome (16). An
abnormal ALTwas defined as <40 U/L on the basis of clinically
used references (38,39) and previous literature (22,28,40).
Examples of clinically used normal reference ranges for ALT
are 10 to 40 U/L for males and 7 to 35 U/L for females (38) and
4 to 36 U/L for either sex (39). Although lower cutoffs have
been used in several older studies (6,27), most recent studies
have used ALT >40 U/L to define an elevated value (28,40).
Descriptive analyses were performed using the Pearson x2
test for dichotomous variables and the adjusted Wald test for
continuous variables. For all regression analyses, ALT >40 U/L
was the dichotomous dependent variable. Univariable and
multivariable logistic regressions were used to evaluate the
main effect of metabolic syndrome on ALT elevation and to
explore several potential effect modifiers and confounders
determined a priori. Age, sex, and ethnicity/race were con-
sidered potential effect modifiers and were tested in that order
using interaction terms in logistic regression and checking with
a stratified analysis. Age, sex, ethnicity/race, poverty­income
ratio, dietary fat intake, and BMI z score were considered
potential confounders and were also tested using logistic
regression. Initially, the association of each potential confound-
ing factor was assessed separately with each exposure and
outcome variable. If a positive association was found with
either the exposure or outcome, then that factor was tested in
a regression model. If its inclusion in the model resulted in a
change in point estimate of the OR by more than 10%, then that
factor was considered a confounder and included in the final
model (41). Appropriate sampling weights, stratum, and popu-
lation sampling unit factors were applied for all analyses to
account for the sampling methods of NHANES, as well as for
the likelihood of nonresponse, for the results to be representa-
tive of the US population of adolescents. Statistical significance
was defined as P < 0.05. All of the analyses were performed
using STATA release 8.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Because the study was to be performed with a fixed sample
size, an effect size calculation performed a priori estimated
that an OR of 4.3 or greater would be detectable, assuming a 5%
2-sided type I error (a), 80% power, that 1.5% of unexposed
subjects would have the outcome (p0
) (11), and 4.2% of the
sample would have the exposure (p1
) (11).
RESULTS
There were 4902 eligible subjects, 12 through 19 years
of age, in the NHANES 1999 to 2002 sample. A total of
1323 subjects were included in the analysis and 3579
were excluded for nonfasted data (55%), positive or
missing pregnancy test (7.6%), elevated or missing bilir-
ubin (5%), incomplete metabolic syndrome component
data (2%), steroid and/or potentially hepatotoxic medi-
cation use (10%), alcohol use (20%), positive or missing
hepatitis C data (0.1%), or positive hepatitis B surface
antigen (0.0005%). There were no differences in age,
ethnicity/race, income, total bilirubin, ALT, BMI, waist
circumference, BP z scores, glucose, TG, low HDL or
dietary fat intake between the included and excluded
groups. There was a statistically significant difference
in the proportion of male subjects in the included (55%
male) versus the excluded group (49% male; P ¼ 0.03),
possibly related to the relatively large proportion of
females excluded for missing pregnancy data (15.6%).
Characteristics of included subjects are described
in Table 2. About 3.6% of subjects had ALT>40 U/L
and 4.7% of subjects met the criteria for metabolic
syndrome.
The main effect of the association between metabolic
syndrome and ALT>40 U/L was OR 16.7 (95% CI 6.2­
45.1, P < 0.001) in the overall sample of adolescents.
There was no interaction by age (P ¼ 0.3). An interaction
by sex was detected by stratified analysis (see data
below) although the interaction term in the model was
not significant (P ¼ 0.17). All further analyses were
performed separately for each sex. Among females, only

2 subjects had both metabolic syndrome and ALT>40U/L
and the association was not statistically significant (OR
3.1; CI 0.4­25.1, P ¼ 0.3), therefore, no further analyses
were conducted in this group. However, the large CI does
not exclude clinically significant associations. Among
males, the association between metabolic syndrome
and ALT>40U/L was strong with OR 20.4 (CI 6.2­
66.7, P < 0.001). An interaction by Hispanic ethnicity
(P ¼ 0.05) was observed. Therefore, a separate analysis
of male subjects by Hispanic ethnicity was conducted and
an OR of 5.0 (CI 1.3­19.0, P ¼ 0.02) was observed among
Hispanic males compared with an OR of 34.3 (CI 7.6­
155.4, P < 0.001) among non-Hispanic males. A graphic
descriptionoftheprevalence ofelevatedALTbymetabolic
syndrome status among males is provided in Figure 1,
stratified by Hispanic ethnicity.
In evaluating potential confounders, the associa-
tions between each potential confounding factor and
the exposure (metabolic syndrome) and outcome
(ALT>40 U/L) were assessed separately for Hispanic
and non-Hispanic males using univariable logistic
regression. Age and dietary fat intake were not associated
with metabolic syndrome or ALT>40 U/L in either
group. Body mass index z score was strongly associated
with ALT>40 U/L among both Hispanic (OR 4.7; CI
2.3­9.9, P < 0.001) and non-Hispanic (OR 3.9; CI 1.3­
11.2, P ¼ 0.02) males. As expected, BMI z score was also
strongly associated with metabolic syndrome among
both Hispanic (OR 44.7; CI 6.5­306, P < 0.001) and
non-Hispanic (OR 19.0; CI 8.4­42.9, P < 0.001) males.
Poverty­income ratio was negatively associated with
metabolic syndrome only among Hispanic males,
whereas it was not associated with ALT>40 U/L in either
group. Body mass index z score and PIR were then
scrutinized further by comparing the univariable and
bivariable models for a 10% change in the point estimate
of the OR. Using this criterion, among Hispanic males,
BMI z score and PIR were confirmed as confounders.
In the final model for Hispanic males, adjustment for
both BMI z score and PIR led the association between
metabolic syndrome and ALT>40 U/L to no longer be
statistically significant (OR 0.4; CI 0.1­1.6, P ¼ 0.2).
Among non-Hispanic males, BMI z score was also a
significant confounder. However, in the final model for
non-Hispanic males, in contrast to the results for Hispa-
nic males, adjustment for BMI z score did not completely
explain the association between metabolic syndrome and
ALT>40 U/L which remained both statistically and clini-
cally significant (OR 11.1; CI 3.2­38.0, P < 0.001). This
suggests that both overweight and metabolic syndrome
were independently contributing to ALTelevation among
non-Hispanic male adolescents.
In a post hoc analysis limited to obese male and female
adolescents, 25% had metabolic syndrome, 14% had
ALT>40 U/L, and 8% had both. Among all obese ado-
lescents, the main association between metabolic syn-
drome and ALT>40 U/L was statistically significant with
OR 4.4 (CI 1.6­12.3, P < 0.01). Among obese adoles-
cents, an interaction by sex was found in stratified
analysis with a significant association among obese
males (OR 4.7; CI 1.4­15.4, P ¼ 0.01), but not among
obese females (OR 1.0; CI 0.1­10.5, P ¼ 0.9). An inter-
action by Hispanic ethnicity was also present (P ¼ 0.03)
among obese males: non-Hispanic (OR 12.4; CI 2.5­
61.4, P < 0.01), Hispanic (OR 0.9; CI 0.2­3.9, P ¼ 0.9).
DISCUSSION
The results of this study support the hypothesis
that metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with
ALT>40 U/L, a surrogate for NAFLD, in a nationally
representative sample of US male adolescents, whereas
the results for female adolescents were inconclusive.
Although this association was explained by BMI among
Hispanic males, metabolic syndrome was independently
associated with 11-fold increased odds of elevated ALT

among non-Hispanic males, regardless of BMI. To our
knowledge, this is the first report of the association
between pediatric metabolic syndrome and elevated
ALT in a US population­based sample of adolescents
as well as the first description of a significant interaction
by sex and ethnicity for this association in a pediatric
population.
The association between metabolic syndrome and ALT
elevation in the pediatric population was previously
described by Park et al (22) in Korean adolescents. In
that study, the age and BMI adjusted OR for the asso-
ciation between elevated ALT (>40 U/L) and metabolic
syndrome was 6.2 (CI 2.3­16.8) (22), which is com-
parable to our findings. The Korean study also found
that the association between metabolic syndrome and
ALT>40 U/L was independent of BMI (22), similar to
our findings among non-Hispanic males. However, a
potential interaction by sex was not evaluated in that
study (22). Another study by Burgert et al (24) performed
in a multiethnic cohort of obese adolescents in the United
States also demonstrated a positive association between
metabolic syndrome and ALT>35 U/L, although the
strength of the association was not reported. Although
the association between metabolic syndrome and NAFLD
has been well described among adults (17­21,42­46),
most pediatric studies have focused on the association
between obesity or hyperinsulinemia, rather than meta-
bolic syndrome, and elevated ALT or NAFLD (6,27,28,
47­49). However, a recent case-control study among
obese children 5 to 17 years of age found that those with
biopsy-proven NAFLD were 5 times more likely to have
metabolic syndrome than those without NAFLD (50).
A significant interaction by sex for the association
between metabolic syndrome and ALT elevation was
found in the present study. Although such interaction
has not been previously reported in the pediatric age,
several adult studies have shown sex differences in the
association between metabolic syndrome and NAFLD
(17,43,51,52). In 2005, Kim et al (43) described an
independent association of metabolic syndrome with
hepatic steatosis by ultrasound in both sexes; however, the
association between metabolic syndrome and elevated
ALT was present in males but not females. Hamaguchi
et al (17) reported a sex difference in the strength of the
association of metabolic syndrome with NAFLD by
ultrasound among Japanese adults (adjusted OR 11.20
for males; adjusted OR 4.00 for females). Sorrentino et al
(52) showed that, among Italian adults with metabolic
syndrome, female sex was associated with ``silent-
NASH,'' for which ALT was normal but liver histology
showed NASH. Our results in adolescents and data from
adult studies suggest the possibility of a biological
difference between the sexes in the degree or timing
of ALT elevation or in the susceptibility of the liver to
effects of metabolic syndrome.
The interaction by Hispanic ethnicity noted for the
association of metabolic syndrome with ALT elevation
among males has not been previously described in the
pediatric or adult literature. However, several studies
have reported a disproportionately higher prevalence
of NAFLD among Hispanic adults compared with other
ethnic groups (51,53). In the pediatric literature, preva-
lence estimates of metabolic syndrome in overweight
Hispanic children living in the United States have been
similar to that of overweight children of other ethnicity
(11,54,55). Our finding of a different strength of associ-
ation between metabolic syndrome and elevated ALT
between Hispanic and non-Hispanic adolescent males, as
well as our finding in non-Hispanic males of an inde-
pendent effect of metabolic syndrome on the odds of
elevated ALT regardless of BMI, suggests potential
environmental, biological, or genetic modifiers in the
development of NAFLD that differ between people of
Hispanic versus non-Hispanic ethnicity. Further study of
these ethnic variations is warranted because this could
have implications for prevention and therapy.
The independent association of metabolic syndrome
with elevated ALT beyond the effect of overweight has
not been specifically described in pediatric studies.
However, insulin resistance, which is closely linked to
metabolic syndrome, has been strongly associated with
NAFLD independent of BMI in adults (56). If metabolic
syndrome is merely a clustering of factors that identify a
person with insulin resistance, then our findings support

the important role of insulin resistance in the develop-
ment of elevated ALT and possibly NAFLD.
The major strengths of this study result from its use of
a large, well-characterized, population-based dataset and
its contribution to advancing knowledge about a signifi-
cant emerging pediatric disease. The data are derived
from a nationally representative sample of adolescents,
which allows for generalizability to the US population
of adolescents. The multiethnic/racial population and
oversampling of Mexican Americans allowed for direct
testing of interaction by Hispanic ethnicity. The measure-
ment of several potential confounding variables also
allowed for either exclusion of or direct testing and
adjustment for these factors.
The limitations of this study include its observational,
cross-sectional study design, which does not allow a
cause­effect relation between metabolic syndrome and
elevated ALT to be determined. The lack of consensus for
a pediatric definition of metabolic syndrome is a potential
limitation (16). The modified ATPIII criteria have been
used in several prior pediatric studies (54,57) and were
adapted here to provide a conservative definition of
metabolic syndrome. The use of ALT as a surrogate
marker for presumed NAFLD is an important limitation.
However, this limitation should be weighed against the
advantage of studying a large nationally representative
database, for which liver biopsy and imaging data are not
available and would be difficult to obtain. Because data in
the pediatric literature support a strong relation between
elevated ALTand histological NAFLD (27,58,59) and we
were able to exclude or account for most alternate
explanations for elevated ALT, we believe this to be a
reasonable surrogate for this study. Although the analysis
used a statistical significance level of P < 0.05, the use of
multiple comparisons could have resulted in some asso-
ciations being spuriously identified; however, the
strength of the main effect is so large that it is unlikely
that this would invalidate our main findings. The main
aim of this study was to evaluate the association of
metabolic syndrome and elevated ALT among US ado-
lescents, rather than to assess the prevalence of elevated
ALT, and therefore, the inclusion and exclusion criteria
used in this study were designed to maximize the internal
validity of this association and the prevalence data pro-
vided here may not be representative of the entire US
population of adolescents. Exclusion of subjects with any
or unknown alcohol use, lack of fasting blood sample,
and other exclusion criteria may affect generalizability of
our findings but are unlikely to affect validity of our
findings in the association between metabolic syndrome
and elevated ALT. This would only be the case if the
association between metabolic syndrome and elevated
ALT was different between included and excluded sub-
jects. We believe that this is unlikely to be the case.
For example, by excluding subjects for alcohol intake,
we may have excluded more of the older adolescents;
however, because there was no interaction by age, we do
not believe that exclusion of older adolescents likely
biased the results. If subjects were to have underreported
their alcohol intake and stated that they never ingested
alcohol but really had, then this could have led to the
inclusion of some subjects who would have otherwise
been excluded.
In conclusion, metabolic syndrome was strongly
associated with elevated ALT, a surrogate for NAFLD,
in a nationally representative sample of US adolescents.
A significant interaction by sex was found with a strong
association in males but no statistically significant asso-
ciation in females. Among Hispanic males, the asso-
ciation between metabolic syndrome and elevated ALT
was largely explained by BMI; however, among non-
Hispanic males, metabolic syndrome was associated with
11-fold increased odds of elevated ALT, independent of
BMI. Future research is warranted into the sex and ethnic
effect modification within the relation between metabolic
syndrome and accurately measured NAFLD in children.
