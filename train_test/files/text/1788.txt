ABSTRACT
Compared with white individuals, black individuals have a significantly higher risk for death in the general
population but seem to have a survival advantage in the ESRD population. Data on the relationship of
race to survival in early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are inconsistent. This study evaluated
racial differences in mortality among the adult participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, a population-based survey of community-dwelling individuals. CKD was defined
either by an estimated GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or by the presence of albuminuria, and this status
was determined for 14,611 individuals, 2892 of whom were found to have CKD. Adjusting for age,
gender, and race, risk for all-cause mortality among individuals with CKD was more than double that
of individuals with normal renal function. In the subgroup with CKD, adjusting for age and gender,
black individuals had a significantly higher risk for death, and this risk was modified by age;
specifically, black individuals who were younger than 65 yr were 78% more likely to die than white
individuals, whereas no significant differences in mortality were observed among individuals who
were 65 yr of age. Further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and CKD stage did not
materially change the results, but the hazard ratios were significantly attenuated after adjustment for
socioeconomic factors. In conclusion, these data demonstrate racial/ethnic disparities in mortality among
individuals with CKD. This higher risk for death in early stages of CKD may explain the apparent survival
advantage observed among black individuals who live long enough to reach stage 5 CKD.

In the general population, the cardiovascular and
noncardiovascular mortality rates for black indi-
viduals are persistently higher than those for white
individuals.1­3 In contrast, studies among individ-
uals who have stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD)
and are undergoing maintenance dialysis have con-
sistently shown that black individuals have a sur-
vival advantage compared with white individuals.4,5
Even though some studies in the general population
have shown lower mortality rates among Mexican
Americans despite a higher prevalence of cardiovas-
cular risk factors and lower socioeconomic status
("Hispanic paradox"), studies with more complete
follow-up demonstrated poorer outcomes in this
ethnic group when compared with non-Hispanic
white individuals.2,6,7 In contrast, Hispanic individ-
uals with stage 5 CKD also seem to have a survival
advantage.5,8 Despite various hypotheses, these
paradoxic disparities with survival advantages for
racial/ethnic minorities undergoing maintenance
dialysis have not been satisfactorily explained.
We undertook this study to test the hypothesis
that black and Mexican American individuals may
have a higher mortality than white individuals at
earlier stages of CKD. Thus, the apparent survival
advantage during stage 5 CKD may be a result of a

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of the 18,825 study participants who were 20 yr of age in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), 715 did not identify themselves as white, black
or Mexican American, and the data on follow-up interval was
inadequate for 88 individuals (Figure 1). An additional 3411
individuals were excluded because they had missing data on
urine albumin or serum creatinine. Thus, a total of 14,611
individuals formed the study cohort (Figure 1). Comparing the
individuals included in the cohort, those with missing data on
urine albumin or serum creatinine were slightly more likely to
be black (12.6 versus 11.7%; P  0.003), to be older (48.6  0.6
versus 44.3  0.5 yr; P  0.001), and to have 12 yr of educa-
tion (27.7 versus 23.1%; P  0.005) and less likely to be obese
(19.2 versus 22.8%; P  0.04).
Of the 14,611 individuals, 2892 had CKD, with a weighted
prevalence of 14.1%. Comparisons of the risk factors among
the three racial/ethnic groups with CKD are summarized in
Table 1. The mean age of white individuals was 7 yr older than
black individuals and 12 yr older than Mexican Americans.
White individuals had the highest prevalence of hypercholes-
terolemia and a family history of premature heart disease and
were most likely to go to a particular place for health care.
Conversely, they were least likely to have diabetes, obesity, low
income, or lower educational attainment or be uninsured (Ta-
ble 1). Black individuals were significantly more likely to be
hypertensive and had the highest prevalence of smoking (Table
1). Mexican Americans had the highest prevalence of diabetes,
obesity, poverty, having less than a high school education, or
being uninsured (Table 1).
Outcomes
The mean follow-up until the time to event or last follow-up
for the cohort was 8.8  0.2 to 9.0  0.2 yr for individuals
without CKD and 7.9  0.2 yr for those with CKD. Among the
14,611 participants, 2171 died: 1127 with CKD and 1104 with-
out CKD. The crude, all-cause mortality among individuals
with CKD was 3.6 per 100 person-years compared with 0.6 per

100 person-years among those without CKD. Of these 2171
deaths, 969 (45%) were attributed to cardiovascular causes,
578 among those with CKD and 391 among those without
CKD. Cardiovascular mortality among individuals with CKD
was 1.8 per 100 patient-years compared with 0.2 per 100 pa-
tient-years without CKD. After adjustment for age, race, and
gender, CKD was associated with 2.2-fold higher hazard ratio
(HR; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9 to 2.5) for all-cause and
2.5-fold higher HR (95% CI 2.1 to 3.0) for cardiovascular mor-
tality. There was no significant interaction between race and
CKD for either all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.
Among the 1127 participants who had CKD and died on
follow-up, 707 were white, 243 were black, and 177 were Mex-
ican American. Only five of these 1127 deaths were attributable
to AIDS and three to homicide/suicide. After adjustment for
age and gender, using white individuals as the reference group,
black individuals with CKD had a substantially elevated risk for
all-cause mortality; this risk was modified by age. The risk for
all-cause mortality was only slightly attenuated upon further
adjustment for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular dis-
ease (model 2) or for socioeconomic factors and access to care
(model 3). Given the significant interaction of race with age on
all-cause mortality, age-stratified analyses were conducted
(Table 2). Among individuals who were younger than 65 yr,
black individuals had a 78% higher risk for death compared
with white individuals (Figure 2A). The higher risk for death in
this age group remained significant even after adjustment for
stage of CKD and cardiovascular risk factors (HR 1.53; 95% CI
1.01 to 2.31) but was attenuated to a NS level upon adjustment
for socioeconomic and access-to-care variables (Table 2).
Conversely, there was no significant difference in the risk for
death in the older subgroups of black and white individuals
(Table 2, Figure 2A). There was a trend toward a higher risk for
all-cause mortality among Mexican Americans, with white in-
dividuals as a reference group; this trend, however, did not
reach statistical significance. A similar trend for an interaction
of age with ethnicity was observed among Mexican Americans
(Table 2, Figure 2B). Entering the data on cardiovascular risk
factors as continuous variables or adding laboratory data (he-
moglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, phosphorus, potassium,
albumin, homocysteine, insulin, and C-reactive protein) did
not change the HR for death among black or Mexican Ameri-
can individuals.
Among the 578 deaths from cardiovascular causes, 384
events occurred among white individuals, 105 among black
individuals, and 89 among Mexican Americans. Upon adjust-
ment for age and gender, the risk for cardiovascular death was
significantly and substantially higher among black compared
with white individuals. The significant interaction of age with
race was apparent for cardiovascular mortality as well such that
the increased risk for cardiovascular mortality was limited to
individuals who were younger than 65 yr (HR 2.11; 95% CI
1.00 to 4.47; Table 2). The same qualitative, albeit NS, trends
were observed after adjustment for stage of CKD and cardio-

vascular risk factors or socioeconomic and access-to-care vari-
ables. There was a trend, albeit statistically NS, for a higher risk
for cardiovascular death among younger Mexican Americans
as well when compared with white individuals (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
Three different sensitivity analyses were performed using
modified definitions of CKD. First, only participants with es-
timated GFR (eGFR) 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were defined as
having CKD (n  996). The second analysis was performed to
account for the fact that only 63% of the NHANES III partici-
pants had persistent microalbuminuria.9 For this analysis,
CKD was defined as the presence of any one of the following:
(1) Stage 3, 4, or 5 CKD; (2) stage 1 or 2 CKD with overt
albuminuria (albumin/creatinine ratio 250 mg/g in men and
355 mg/g in women); and (3) a random selection of 54% of
individuals with stage 1 and 73% of individuals with stage 2
CKD with microalbuminuria (total n  2212).9 Finally, for the
third analysis, all 3411 individuals with insufficient informa-
tion to determine CKD status were considered to have CKD
(n  6207).
The same qualitative trends that were observed in the main
cohort were seen in each of the three sensitivity analyses per-
formed (Table 3). Thus, there was a progressive decrease in the
HR for all-cause mortality among black compared with white
individuals, with increasing age in each of the three sensitivity
analyses. The same qualitative trend for a higher risk for death
was noted for Mexican Americans.
DISCUSSION
The key finding of this study may have important public health
implications. Using a random sample of the population of the
United States, black individuals with CKD were found to have a
substantially higher risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortal-
ity, a risk modified by age. Similar trends, albeit not statistically
significant, were observed among Mexican Americans.
In the general population, racial disparities have been re-
ported with particularly inferior outcomes among black indi-
viduals with cardiovascular diseases and cancers.1­3 Disparities
in several different outcomes also have been reported in pop-
ulations with CKD. Thus, black individuals are less likely to
receive erythropoietin in the predialysis stage of CKD, more
likely to progress to ESRD, less likely to achieve clinical perfor-
mance measure targets while undergoing maintenance hemo-
dialysis, and less likely to be referred for transplantation and
have a lower transplant allograft survival when compared with
similar populations of white individuals.10­15 Our study adds
to this list of disparities.
Numerous studies have now documented the increased risk
for death conferred by the presence of CKD, either by the pres-
ence of albuminuria or reduction in GFR16; however, up until
recently, racial difference in mortality outcomes among non­
dialysis-dependent patients with CKD has received only lim-
ited attention. Using pooled analyses of four community-
based studies, Weiner et al.17 suggested that there may be a
significant interaction between race and CKD. Thus, the pres-
ence of CKD conferred a greater increase in risk for the com-
posite end point of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and
stroke among black than among white individuals. The inves-
tigators attributed this interaction to residual confounding,
with the differences possibly relating to greater severity of hy-
pertension and/or diabetes in black individuals. Consistent
with these findings, CKD has been reported to result in a sig-
nificantly greater increase in risk for coronary artery disease
mortality or incident congestive heart failure among blacks
than white individuals.18,19 In our study, death was the only
outcome measure studied, and we were unable to demonstrate
any interaction between race and CKD.
Our findings are in contrast to those reported among vet-
erans with diabetes, wherein racial and ethnic minorities had a
lower risk for death than white individuals, a survival advan-

tage also seen among the subgroup with diabetic nephropa-
thy.20 The differences in outcomes may be a result of better and
equal access to care among veterans when compared with the
general population.
The modifying effect of age on the racial differences in out-
comes has previously been reported in the general population
but not among individuals with CKD.21 Thus, the health dis-
parities seem to be greatest in the younger age groups. Similar
outcomes among the elderly blacks and white individuals with
CKD may reflect either survivor bias (such that only the
healthiest black individuals survive into old age) or the benefit
of federal/state programs for the elderly, such as Medicare, that
provide improved access to care for participating individuals
equally, thus minimizing racial disparities. The results of vari-
ous studies that have examined the racial differences in mor-
tality of elderly with CKD have come to differing conclusions.
On the one hand, elderly black individuals who are hospital-
ized for congestive heart failure or survivors of acute myocar-
dial infarction seem to have a survival advantage over white
individuals.22­24 On the other hand, analyses using the Medi-
care 5% sample standard analytical files demonstrated that
black individuals, with or without CKD, had a higher risk for
death.25 Unlike previous investigations of the elderly, the co-
hort in this study was a random selection of noninstitutional-
ized population of United States, and the baseline assessment
of renal function was comprehensive (including serum creati-
nine and albuminuria) and was done with individuals in a
steady state and serum creatinine was calibrated to the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) laboratory
measurements.
Our study provides some insight into the reasons for the
higher risk for death among younger black individuals with
CKD, relative to white individuals. The higher risk for death
among younger black compared with white individuals per-
sisted despite multivariate adjustment for cardiovascular risk
factors; however, the HR was attenuated to a NS level upon
adjustment for socioeconomic and access-to-care variables.
These data suggest that factors such as education, poverty, and
lower probability of medical insurance may be more important
in mediating the high risk for death among younger black in-
dividuals than are biologic differences. This, in turn, may help
in prioritizing interventions aimed at reducing the disparities
among younger black individuals with CKD. Recognition of
this disparity among younger black individuals raises two im-
portant issues. First, the substantially higher mortality among
black individuals with early stage CKD may suggest that the
disparity in adverse CKD outcomes is far greater than previ-
ously suggested by studies restricted to ESRD progression. Sec-
ond, the survival advantage of black individuals seen in studies
of dialysis patients may be accounted for the higher risk for
death seen in this racial group at early stages of CKD such that
the black individuals who live long enough to reach stage 5
CKD are healthier than white individuals. This hypothesis is
consistent with the recent observations from the Dialysis Out-
comes and Practice Patterns Study that reported that minority
individuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis in the
United States are healthier than their white counterparts, ac-
counting for the former's survival advantage.5
In recent years, demographic shifts have made Latinos the
largest minority group in the United States.26 Unlike the data
for black individuals, the comparative data for Latinos are
rather limited. Early studies in the general population indi-
cated that despite a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk
factors (obesity and diabetes) and lower socioeconomic status,
Latinos had lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality when
compared with non-Hispanic white individuals ("Hispanic
paradox").6 Subsequent data, however, suggested that out-
comes among many subgroups of Latinos may actually be
worse than that for white individuals.2,7,27 The data on out-
comes for Latinos with CKD are far more limited. At least three
studies suggested that Latinos, like black individuals, with
ESRD may have a survival advantage when compared with
white individuals.8,28,29
To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe racial
differences in outcomes using a population that included a
substantial proportion of non­dialysis-dependent Mexican
Americans with CKD. The same qualitative trends, with a
higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among Mexican
Americans, were observed as those for black individuals; how-
ever, none of the trends reached statistical significance. This
may reflect that there are no significant differences in out-
comes of Mexican Americans and white individuals with CKD.

Alternatively, this may be a result of relatively smaller sample
size and fewer events, particularly cardiovascular, among Mex-
ican Americans. Thus, larger studies with longer follow-up
that allow more events to accrue will be needed to determine
whether a similar disparity in outcomes exist for Mexican
Americans with CKD.
This study has several limitations. First, the sample size and
the number of events for some subgroups were small, such as
for Mexican Americans. This is also true for the age-stratified
analyses and cardiovascular mortality. Second, it is possible
that some Mexican Americans may have died in their country
of origin and, therefore, their data may not have been captured
by a review of the National Death Index (NDI). This may have
led us to underestimate the risk for death in this ethnic popu-
lation (salmon effect). Third, almost one fifth of eligible par-
ticipants did not have enough data to determine the presence/
absence of CKD; however, our sensitivity analyses suggest that
this missing information is unlikely to have biased the study
results. Fourth, data on risk factors were ascertained only at
baseline; therefore, we could not systematically control for dif-
ferences in severity of risk factors or perform time-dependent
analyses. Finally, the baseline evaluation occurred before the
benefits of contemporary therapies like blockers of the renin-
angiotensin system were established.
This study shows a higher all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality for younger black individuals with early-stage CKD.
The disparity in all-cause mortality remained after accounting
for differences in prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors but
was attenuated to NS levels after adjustment for socioeco-
nomic status. Survivor bias, arising from the higher mortality
during early stages of CKD, may explain the lower mortality
seen among black individuals with ESRD. For determination
of whether the noted trends for disparities exist for Mexican
Americans with CKD, larger studies with longer follow-ups are
needed.
CONCISE METHODS
NHANES III was a study conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) between 1988 and 1994.30 Study participants were
selected using a complex, multistage, stratified, and clustered proba-
bility sampling of the noninstitutionalized population of the United
States, and the baseline data were accrued between 1988 and 1994.31
The study design included a deliberate oversampling of black and
Mexican American individuals and the elderly.31
The cohort for this study constituted white, black, and Mexican
American individuals who were 20 yr of age and had CKD. For the
survey, the participants self-identified as belonging to a given racial/
ethnic group. eGFR, using the abbreviated MDRD equation, and
urine albumin/creatinine ratio were used to determine CKD.32 The
creatinine measurements in the NHANES III were calibrated to the
MDRD laboratory by subtracting 0.23 mg/dl, as described previous-
ly.9 An individual was identified as having CKD when (1) eGFR was
60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or (2) eGFR was 60 but urine albumin/
creatinine was 17 mg/g in men and 25 mg/g in women.32
Definition of Variables
Hypertension was defined as present when the individual was taking
antihypertensive medications or the measured BP was 140/90
mmHg. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as a total cholesterol 200
mg/dl because only one third of the participants had data on LDL
cholesterol. Diabetes was defined as a history of diabetes, being
treated with medications for diabetes, or having a fasting blood glu-
cose 126 mg/dl. Obesity was defined as a body mass index 30
kg/m2. Current smokers were individuals who currently smoked and
had consumed at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. The Na-
tional Kidney Foundation's definition was used to designate stages of
CKD.32
Education was used as a dichotomous variable (12 or 12 com-
pleted years of schooling). Patients were classified as having any
health insurance or none. The effect of income was assessed by deter-
mining whether the participant's household income was 200 or
200% of the federal poverty level. Access to care was defined as
whether a participant reported going to a particular facility for care.
Determination of Vital Status
Survival was determined by linking the baseline data to the mortality
follow-up file.33 In this file, the MORTSTAT variable indicates the
final ascertainment of patients' vital status by the NCHS, with a par-
ticipant deemed to be dead when a probabilistic match was made on
the NDI screen or on a death certificate or both.33 For the former, the
data in the NDI were screened from the time of individuals' enroll-
ment in the NHANES III until December 31, 2000. To assign accu-
rately the vital status to study participants using the NDI, the NCHS
conducted a calibration study to develop the criteria used for the
study.33 Cause of death was coded using the International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) up until 1998 and ICD-10 for
1999 and 2000. All deaths before 1999 were recoded by the NCHS into
comparable ICD-10 codes; the causes for all deaths of the study par-
ticipants, using ICD-10 codes, are available in the UCOD_113 vari-
able. The following range of codes for the UCOD_113 variable was
used to define cardiovascular deaths: 056 to 063 and 067 to 074. This
definition included, among others, causes of death related to hyper-
tensive heart disease, atherosclerosis including coronary and cerebro-
vascular disease, heart failure, and aortic aneurysms.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using sample weights that account for
unequal probability of selection; nonresponse; and planned oversam-
pling of elderly, black, and Mexican American individuals. Estimates
were made using the recommended SAS-callable SUDAAN software
(version 8; Research Triangle Park, NC). Continuous variables are
expressed as means  SEM.
All individuals without a probabilistic match were deemed to be
alive on December 31, 2000. Cox proportional hazards analysis was
used to determine the effect of CKD on survival using data from the
entire cohort of 14,611 individuals. All subsequent analyses were re-
stricted to individuals with CKD, and three statistical models were
built. Various interaction terms with race were tested in the cohort
with CKD; only one (age*race) was statistically significant. This inter-
action term was included in all subsequent models, and age-stratified

analyses were performed (65, 65 to 75, and 75 yr). Given the
significant differences in age between the participants belonging to
the various racial/ethnic groups, the primary survival analyses were
adjusted for age, race, and gender (model 1). The second model was
constructed to test whether the racial/ethnic differences in survival
could be accounted for by differences in cardiovascular risk factors
and thus included, in addition to demographics (age, race, and gen-
der), traditional cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, cholesterol
200 mg/dl, diabetes, obesity, current smoking, and family history of
premature heart disease) and stage of CKD (model 2). The third
model was constructed to test whether the racial/ethnic differences in
survival could be accounted for by differences in socioeconomic sta-
tus/access to care and thus included, in addition to demographics,
socioeconomic factors (education, insurance, and income), access to
care (go to particular place for care), and stage of CKD (model 3). To
estimate the racial/ethnic differences in cardiovascular mortality, we
performed similar analyses after censoring participants who died of
noncardiovascular causes. All of these analyses were repeated on the
three data sets created for sensitivity analyses.
