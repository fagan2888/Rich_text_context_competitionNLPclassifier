Introduction
According to the 2015 cancer statistics of the American
Cancer Society, lung cancer is the most common cancer in
the United States of America in terms of mortality among
both males (28%) and females (26%).1 In Korea, lung cancer
is also the most common cancer in terms of mortality among
both males (26%) and females (16%).2 Lung cancer treat-
ment is outlined in the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) Guidelines.3,4 In the United States, 20% of
the patients with advanced non­small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) receive chemotherapy alone, 17% receive radia-
tion therapy alone, and 35% receive a combination of the 2
regimens. Among chemotherapy recipients, targeted therapy

Abstract
Objective. To investigate the clinical effect and the overall survival (OS) rate of patients with advanced non­small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) who have undergone Wheel Balance Cancer Therapy (WBCT). Methods. The cases of 33 patients with
advanced NSCLC who were treated with WBCT at the East West Cancer Center (EWCC) between October 4, 2004, and
October 3, 2013, without undergoing concurrent conventional treatment were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to estimate the OS of the cases, and the median OS was calculated according to age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), conventional-treatment history, WBCT treatment duration, and histological
tumor type. Results. The median OS of all patients was 31.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.5-58.7) months; the OS rates
were 63.6% and 24.2% at years 1 and 2, respectively. The median OS rates of patients under and over 65 years were 45.2
(95% CI = 13.5-76.9) and 19.5 (95% CI = 7.1-31.8) months, respectively (P = .189). The median OS rates of patients who
received WBCT for >14 days but <28 days and those who received WBCT for 28 days were 16.2 (95% CI = 13.3-19.2)
and 45.2 (95% CI = 14.4-76.0) months, respectively (P = .437). The median OS rates of patients who had undergone prior
conventional treatment and those who had not were 45.2 (95% CI = 9.1-81.3) and 3.9 (95% CI = unable to calculate)
months, respectively (P = .000). The median OS rates of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and non-SCC
lung cancer were 5.6 (95% CI = unable to calculate) and 45.2 (95% CI = 9.1-81.3) months, respectively (P = .262). The
median OS rate of patients with ECOG PS 3 was 14.3 (95% CI = 8.8-19.8) months; that of patients ECOG PS <3 could
not be calculated. However, the mean OS rates of patients with ECOG PS <3 and with ECOG PS 3 were 85.7 (95%
CI = 58.4-113.0) and 12.7 (95% CI = 8.5-16.9) months, respectively (P = .000). No severe adverse events were encountered.
Conclusions. Our study indicates that WBCT might be effective to prolong the length of survival for patients with advanced
NSCLC who have previously undergone conventional treatment and have an ECOG PS <3.

with bevacizumab is used in 16.5% of the cases; erlotinib,
cetuximab, and crizotinib may also be used to treat the
advanced stage of the disease.5
Although anticancer treatment is important for cancer
therapy, symptom management is also necessary. Palliative
care, including symptom management, prolongs the survival
time of advanced NSCLC patients.6 Integrative treatment is
generally used to increase the quality of life and alleviate
symptoms. However, in the treatment of advanced NSCLC,
integrative treatment is also able to enhance the immune sys-
tem and prolong the survival time7,8 and can be used as main-
tenance therapy.9 The American College of Chest Physicians
has published evidence-based clinical practice guidelines
(3rd edition) for the diagnosis and management of lung can-
cer in complementary and integrative medicine.10
The theories of traditional Korean medicine (KM) view
human physiology as a network of interdependent organ
systems; thus, health is defined as a stable balance among
these networks where the metabolism of each organ system
is in harmony with that of the other systems. KM therapies
focus on restoring homeostasis by synchronizing the net-
works of the metabolic pathways, thus creating favorable
physical environments in which the immune system can
function properly. Recently, scientific evidence supporting
the efficacy of KM has been found in both preliminary and
clinical studies on cancer care. Based on the results of those
studies, KM is useful in the management of cancer symp-
toms and can increase survival. In addition, KM treatment
can be effectively integrated into conventional therapy.11
Wheel Balance Cancer Therapy (WBCT), which is based
on KM, is an integrative cancer treatment program at the
East West Cancer Center (EWCC), which is one of the major
integrative cancer centers in Korea. Conventional modes of
cancer treatments mostly target tumors whereas WBCT is an
indirect approach that targets the physiological environment
to induce cancer regression and tumor dormancy.
WBCT can be administered either as inpatient or outpa-
tient care. However, in this study, we needed to evaluate the
implementation of WBCT, so we investigated only patients
who had been treated on an inpatient basis. WBCT includes
an anticancer diet, metabolism activation, anti-angiogenic
and immune-enhancing herbal therapy, meditation, and
exercise.12 For the anticancer diet, patients are given a per-
sonal diet plan and are advised to consume green vegetables
and fruit juice twice a day, which is served at the EWCC.
For metabolism activation, patients received acupuncture,
moxibustion, hydrotherapy (herbal steam baths), herbal hot
pack therapy, and pharmacopuncture (herbal acupuncture)
treatments. For antiangiogenic agents and immunotherapy,
antiangiogenic and immune-system-stimulating agents,
including anticancer capsules (HangAm-Plus [HAP])13-15
and immune-enhancing capsules (MyunYuk-Plus
[MYP]),16,17 are orally administered daily. HAP and MYP,
which were developed at the EWCC and consist of herbal
medicines, have been used for about 20 years at the EWCC
for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. Under a phy-
sician's supervision, patients are given advice on improving
the conditions of their minds and bodies through medita-
tion, controlled breathing, yoga, and qi-gong. WBCT is
usually, but not always, given concurrently with conven-
tional therapy at the EWCC.
Although WBCT is an integrative cancer intervention
used at the EWCC of Daejeon University, Korea, no studies
have been done to identify its possible benefits as a sole
therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the possi-
bilities of using the WBCT of the EWCC as an alternative
approach to the treatment of patients with advanced
NSCLC.
Patients and Methods
Eligibility and Chart Review
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee,
EWCC (IRB No. DJUMC 14-08). From October 4, 2004, to
October 3, 2013, patients were enrolled in the study at their
first visit to the EWCC. The eligibility criteria were as fol-
lows: (1) diagnosis of lung cancer; (2) treatment with only
WBCT without ongoing conventional therapy in the hospi-
tal; (3) presence of historically confirmed NSCLC; (4)
treatment with WBCT for more than 14 days; (5) Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
(PS)18 Score of 0 to 3.
During this period, 713 patients who had a diagnosis of
lung cancer visited the EWCC. Because the purpose of this
research was to investigate the effectiveness of WBCT alone,
without any other treatment, 664 patients who underwent
simultaneous conventional therapy or who had no record con-
cerning use of conventional therapy were excluded. Because
this research had NSCLC as its focus, patients with SCLC or
no record of tumor classification were excluded.
WBCT is a holistic total cancer care program that is
composed of herbal medications, an anticancer diet, exer-
cise, acupuncture, moxibustion, and so on. In our opinion,
WBCT should be continued for at least 14 days if it is to
have an effect on the cancer patients, so we analyzed only
patients who underwent WBCT without ongoing conven-
tional therapy in the hospital for more than 14 days. Thus, 4
patients who underwent WBCT for fewer than 14 days and
2 patients who took no WBCT were excluded. We also
excluded 4 patients who had ECOG PS scores of 4 and one
patient whose diagnosis date was uncertain. Finally, 33
patients were included in this research (Figure 1).
Treatment: Wheel Balance Cancer Therapy
A physician completes a physical examination of each
patient during treatment. A physical examination includes
Kim et al 469
an electrocardiogram, laboratory studies (common blood
count and differential blood count, as well as liver and renal
function tests), and radiology tests. Based on the results, all
patients in the study received only WBCT in the hospital for
more than 14 days.
When a patient visits the EWCC, an oncologist exam-
ines the patient and teaches him or her how to eat, exercise,
and meditate; prescribes herbal medicine; and develops an
intervention plan for that patient. A nurse and a specialist
helps the patient exercise and implement the intervention
plan in the hospital.12 The details of the WBCT program are
presented in Table 1.
We suggest that patients continue to be treated with WBCT
after hospital discharge and teach them to care for themselves
through diet, excise, and meditation. Some continue to follow
the regimen, but for personal reasons, some do not. Although
we do not have data, one of the reasons for their not continuing
with the regimen outside the hospital might be an economic
one, that is, the lack of coverage by medical insurance. In this
study, we investigated only inpatient WBCT.
Evaluation and Statistical Analysis
Evaluation and statistical analyses were performed as fol-
lows: basic characteristics that were investigated included
gender, age, ECOG PS, histopathology, whether the patient
underwent conventional treatment and if so, treatment dura-
tion (14 days but <28 days or 28 days), lines of chemo-
therapy, cancer stage, and metastases. The overall survival
(OS) rate and the hazard ratio (HR) were calculated from
the date of diagnosis to the date of death as recorded on the
chart or the date of the last follow-up of a patient who was
expected to expire within a month according to an expert's
opinion. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the
OS and the median OS according to age, ECOG PS, previ-
ous conventional treatment, WBCT treatment duration, and
histological tumor type. The analysis of the median survival
was performed by using PASW Statistics version 17.0
(SPSS, Chicago, IL). For safety and assessment of toxicity,
we measured the liver function and the renal function
through a blood test. Adverse events were assessed by using
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE) version 4.03.19
Results
Patient Characteristics
In total, of the 713 lung cancer patients who visited EWCC,
33 met our eligibility criteria and were selected (Table 2).
Figure 1. Patient eligibility.

The mean age was 63.2 years (range = 25-83 years). Eight
patients (24.2%) had received a surgical resection of the
tumor, 18 (54.5%) patients had received prior chemother-
apy, 15 patients (45.5%) had received radiotherapy, and 5
patients (15.2%) never received any conventional treat-
ment. Histological examination confirmed an adenocarci-
noma in 24 patients (72.7%) and a squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) in 7 patients (21.2%). Tumors had metastasized to
the bone in 13 patients, the liver in 9 patients, the other lung
in 8 patients, and the brain in 7 patients. Three patients had
no metastasis in different organs, but because of their age
and physical condition, they had not undergone conven-
tional therapy.
Treatment Outcomes
We investigated the survival rate according to age, duration
of WBCT, history of prior chemotherapy, histopathology,
and ECOG PS. For the analyses of the OS, we used the
Kaplan-Meier method,20 and correlations among the 2
groups were established by using the HR (Table 3).
We used the aforementioned method to determine statis-
tically the median OS rate, the 1-year survival rate, and the
2-year survival rate for all patients. The median survival of
all patients was 31.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.5-
58.7) months, and the OS rates were 63.6% and 24.2% at
the ends of years 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 2).
We analyzed the median OS rate according to the age of
the patient. For that, we divided the patients into 2 groups,
one younger than 65 years of age (N = 15) and the other 65
years of age or older (N = 18). The median OS rates of the
patients in the former and the latter groups were 45.2 (95%
CI = 13.5-76.9) and 19.5 (95% CI = 7.1-31.8) months,
respectively. However, the survival outcomes of the 2
groups were not significantly different by the log-rank test
(P = .189; Figure 3).
We also analyzed the median OS rate according to the
duration of WBCT treatment for the 2 groups, one that
underwent WBCT for 14 days or longer but less than 28
days (N = 16) and the other that underwent WBCT for 28
days or longer (N = 17). The median OS rates of the patients
in the former and the latter groups were 16.2 (95%
CI = 13.3-19.2) and 45.2 (95% CI = 14.4-76.0) months,
respectively. However, the survival outcomes of the 2
groups were not significantly different by the log-rank test
(P = .437; Figure 4).
Furthermore, we analyzed the median OS rate according
to whether or not conventional treatment had been received,
so we divided the patients into 2 groups, one that had under-
gone prior conventional treatment (N = 28) and one that had
not (N = 5). The median OS rates of the patients in the for-
mer and the latter groups were 45.2 (95% CI = 9.1-81.3)
and 3.9 (95% CI = unable to calculate because of the data
having been censored) months, respectively. The survival
outcomes of the 2 groups were significantly different by the
log-rank test (P = .000; Figure 5).
We also analyzed the median OS according to the histo-
logical type of the tumor. For that, we divided the patients

into 2 groups, one with SCC lung cancer (N = 7) and the
other with non-SCC lung cancer (N = 24). The median OS
rates of the SCC patients and the non-SCC patients were 5.6
(95% CI = unable to calculate because of the data having
been censored) and 45.2 (95% CI = 9.1-81.3) months,
respectively. However, the survival outcomes of the 2
groups were not significantly different by the log-rank test
(P = .262; Figure 6).
To analyze the median OS rate according to ECOG PS,
we divided the patients into 2 groups, one with ECOG PS
3 (N = 20) and the other with ECOG PS <3 (N = 13). The
median OS rate of the patients with ECOG PS 3 was 14.3
(95% CI = 8.8-19.8) months, and that of the patients with
ECOG PS <3 could not be calculated because too many of
the data had been censored; however, the mean OS rate for
that group was 85.7 (95% CI = 58.4-113.0) months while
the mean OS rate for the group with ECOG PS <3 was 17.2
(95% CI = 8.5-16.9) months. The survival outcomes of the
2 groups were significantly different by the log-rank test
(P = .000; Figure 7).
Safety
We did blood tests when the patients were first admitted to
hospital, when they were discharged, and when adverse
events occurred. In the blood tests, we checked neutrophil
count, liver function, and renal function, including aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), -glutamyl transferase (GGT),
and creatinine (Cr). We also evaluated the outcomes by
using CTCAE.19
The adverse events encountered during this research are
listed in Table 4. The 4 patients who had elevated ALP also
showed bone metastases; however, during the stay in the
hospital, the ALP levels of those patients did not increase
further. Five patients had elevated GGT levels when they
entered the hospital, and those levels did not increase fur-
ther while the patients remained hospitalized. One patient
had an elevated Cr level, which did not increase further
while the patient remained hospitalized. No severe adverse
events were encountered.
Discussion
Recently, various integrative cancer therapies have been
tried. As WBCT is also one of those therapies, the effective-
ness of WBCT compared with conventional therapy for
NSCLC patients,21 case reports on WBCT,12 and survival
outcomes after WBCT intervention13-17 have been investi-
gated. This research is the first to investigate and report the
results of the survival times of patients with advanced
NSCLC who were treated only with WBCT without any
other concurrent treatment.
For this research, we reviewed the records of 773 patients
who visited the EWCC during a 10-year period and selected
33 patients who had advanced NSCLC and who had been
treated with WBCT without concurrent conventional ther-
apy. WBCT includes interventions that inhibit the growth of
cancer cells, reduce the patient's stress, alleviate the
patient's symptoms, and enhance the patient's body condi-
tion. The combined effect of these interventions is thought
to help the patients themselves to overcome the cancer.
Thus, WBCT is a total care system, not one treatment.
Many studies have investigated individual complementary
treatment methods, but this study of WBCT investigated the
effect of integrative therapy that included a variety of com-
plementary and alternative treatments.

We used the NCCN guidelines to compare our results
obtained using WBCT with those obtained using conven-
tional therapy.3 In conventional therapy, a curative surgi-
cal resection is the optimal treatment, but the use of this
procedure is impossible in patients with advanced or met-
astatic NSCLC because the surrounding tissues are
involved and distant metastases are present. Instead, such
patients receive systemic therapy to prolong their survival
time. Two hospitals in the United Kingdom investigated
(during a 2-year period) patients with advanced NSCLC
who had received multiple lines of systemic therapy. After
the first-line systemic therapy, 50 out of 110 patients
received the second-line systemic therapy, of which 10
patients received the third-line and 2 patients received the
fourth-line systemic therapy.22 Thus, approximately 45%
of the patients who received the first-line therapy subse-
quently received therapy again because of recurrent or
progressive NSCLC.

Overall survival was longer in the group of patients younger than 65
years of age than it was in the group of patients 65 years of age or older,
but the difference was not statistically significant.

According to the NCCN guidelines, the standard first-
line therapy is platinum-based doublet chemotherapy,
which may be combined with etoposide, docetaxel, gem-
citabine, vinblastine, pemetrexed, or vinorelbine.23,24 After
the failure of the first- and the second-line therapies, a new
target agent, such as nivolumab, ramucirumab, erlotinib,
afatinib, or crizotinib, is selected with a chemotherapy
combination.3 Patients with ECOG PS 0 to 2 have options
for subsequent therapy; those options include docetaxcel,
pemetrexed, erlotinib, gemcitabine, ramucirumab plus
docetaxel, or nivolumab.3
In several phase III studies of cytotoxic agents for the
second-line therapy, the reported values for the median OS
rate with docetaxel treatment were 30.7 weeks,25 7.0
months,26 5.7 months,27 7.9 months,28 and 8.0 months,29 and
those for pemetrexed treatment were 8.3 months28 and 10.1
months.30 In a recent phase III study of ramucirumab plus
docetaxel, the median OS rate was 10.5 months.31 In another
phase III study of nivolumab for advanced SCC-NSCLC
patients, the median OS rate was 9.2 months.32 If an epider-
mal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is sensitized

positive, patients may receive EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibi-
tors (TKIs) such as erlotinib or afatinib. In 2 different
second-line therapy phase III studies of EGFR TKIs, the
median OS rates with erlotinib treatment were 8.2 months30
and 7.9 months.33 For anaplastic lymphoma kinase­positive
patients, crizotinib is superior for chemotherapy.34 The
median OS rate with crizotinib treatment was 20.3 months.35
In a phase II study of docetaxel plus bevacizumab combina-
tion therapy, the median OS rate was 21.6 months.36 In a
study of recurrent or advanced NSCLC patients who received
the triplet cisplatin, docetaxel, and irinotecan, the median OS
rate was 14.3 months, but this combination has been proven
to be too toxic to be used for patient treatment (Table 5).37
In a study conducted in China, treatment of advanced
NSCLC in dementia patients with traditional Chinese medi-
cine (TCM) alone was found to be superior to chemother-
apy alone in elevating the quality of life and prolonging
survival time.38 Another study39 investigated the effect of
another TCM therapy, Guben Xiaoliu Capsule (GCX), in
treating patients with advanced NSCLC. In terms of the
immediate effect, the integrative group (chemotherapy plus
GCX, 16.7%) was apparently superior to the TCM alone
group (GCX only). However, the median OS rate was 15
months in the TCM alone group, 12 months in the integra-
tive group, and 9 months in the chemotherapy alone group.
The TCM alone group also showed reduced toxicity.
Furthermore, in the United States, 193 patients with
colon cancer were treated at a clinic of Chinese medicine
and by using conventional therapy. They were treated with
herbal medicine as Chinese medicine or Pan-Asian medi-
cine plus vitamins, both of which were combined with con-
ventional therapy and integrative treatment including diet
and exercise. The combined treatment reduced the risk of
death for patients with stage 4 colon cancer by 75% com-
pared with that for patients with stage 4 colon cancer treated
with conventional therapy alone.40

A Korean study investigated the survival of patients with
NSCLC stages over IIIb treated with HAP, which contains
anti-angiogenic agents derived from Korean herbal medi-
cine and is included in WBCT as an anticancer treatment. In
that clinical study, the 1-year survival rate was 62.1%, the
2-year survival rate was 34.9%, and the median survival
time was 17.0 months.21 HAP suppresses inflammatory
responses by inhibiting Syk/NF-B and JNK/ATF-2
pathways.13 It also inhibits the activities of the matrix metal-
loproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 and upregulates the
expressions of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
(TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2, which inhibits the motility and the
invasiveness of NCI-H460 cells.15
This study investigated the impact of using WBCT for
the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. The
median OS rate of all patients was 31.1 (95% CI = 3.5-58.7)
months, and the OS rates were 63.6% and 24.2% at the ends
of years 1 and 2, respectively, indicating that the treatment
was safe.
Because prior chemotherapy had failed for 28 of the 33
patients included in this research, they visited the EWCC
for WBCT treatment. Four of these patients were over 70
years of age, and 1 patient had a private reason for visiting
the EWCC. Thirteen patients could not receive additional
conventional therapy because of an ECOG PS = 3. We
treated these advanced NSCLC patients with WBCT. The
survival time was longer for patients under the age of 65
than it was for patients 65 years of age or older (HR = 1.156,
P = .828) and for patients with ECOG PS 0 to 2 than it was
for patients with ECOG PS = 3 (HR = 11.480, P = .004).
Thus, younger patients (<65 years of age) and patients with
ECOG PS 0 to 2 treated with WBCT had longer median OS
than the more elderly patients (65 years of age) and those
with ECOG PS = 3. However, the difference in the median
OS rate according to age was not statistically significant.
Of the 28 patients who had undergone prior chemother-
apy, 22 patients received more than the third line of therapy
(maximum = seventh line). The chemotherapy regimens
included cisplatin, docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine,
paclitaxel, and carboplatin. The median OS rate of the
patients who underwent conventional treatment including
systemic therapy was 45.2 months as compared with 3.9
months for patients who had undergone no conventional
treatment. Of the 5 patients who had never undergone con-
ventional therapy, 4 patients had ECOG PS 3 and were over
70 years of age; their general condition was poor, and treat-
ment was limited, so their survival time was shorter than
that of the other patients.
In the aforementioned studies, the median OS rate for
chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents was 7.0 to 10.1 months.
The median OS with combination therapy with a target
agent was up to 21.6 months, whereas it was 15.0 to 17.0
months with TCM alone or combination therapy with KM.
The median OS of patients with advanced NSCLC treated
with WBCT was 31.1 months, that is, longer than in the
previously mentioned cases.
WBCT is an integrative cancer treatment program at the
EWCC. While the exact metabolic pathway of WBCT has
not yet been identified, WBCT is thought to suppress can-
cer by inhibiting angiogenesis and enhancing immunity13-17
and to alleviate clinical symptoms by using KM therapy
such as herbal medication, acupuncture, moxibustion, and
so on. The median OS rate of patients who had undergone
prior chemotherapy was 45.2 months; WBCT is thought to
be a tumor-dormancy-inducing therapy for patients who
resist conventional regimens.41 Tumor dormancy is known
to contribute to homeostatic controls, such as anti-
angiogenesis, despite active proliferation and immuno-
logical conditions.42
For patients with advanced NSCLC, because of old age,
the adverse effects of chemotherapy, the lack of tolerance to
chemotherapy regimens, the failure of many lines of ther-
apy, and private reasons, some cancer patients cannot
undergo conventional systemic therapy. Cytotoxic therapy
is important for reducing tumor size, but adverse events can
affect the patients' condition and survival. In addition to
survival, alleviating symptoms and elevating quality of life
are important to patients.6,43 Our study suggests that WBCT
may be a good alternative therapeutic approach for treating
patients with advanced NSCLC. Blood tests, including neu-
trophil count, liver function, and renal function, revealed no
severe adverse events.
However, this study has several limitations. WBCT was
practiced only at the EWCC and only for a limited time
period. The period from 2004 to 2013, from which the can-
cer patients were selected, was too long, and the records
that were available had many limitations. Thus, many
patients were excluded. Of the 713 patients with lung can-
cer that were initially evaluated from this time period, only
33 met the eligibility criteria and were included in this
study. In addition, because of the retrospective observa-
tional nature of this study, not all the dates of death were
known exactly, so some statistical analyses were based on
the last follow-up. Because the assumption that all censored
survival times occurred immediately after their censoring
times may not be reasonable, the survival estimates may be
somewhat biased. This study included patients who had
been treated at various times over a 10-year period, during
which time standard therapy and survival times changed for
the better. Thus, selecting patients with exactly the same
conditions from all the patients in that 10-year period was
difficult. The records for the safety assessment were limited
because of the long period of time from which patients were
selected.
In the future, we need to investigate advanced conven-
tional therapy and the impact of wealth. Conventional ther-
apy is improving, and newly developed agents are being
added. We will continue our analysis by comparing the
476 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(4)
results achieved with WBCT against those achieved by using
the new agents. Furthermore, we know that the efficacy of
WBCT treatment depends on the duration of the treatment
and that some patients might not continue the treatment for
financial reasons, such as the lack of money or the lack of
coverage by medical insurance. Thus, further studies address-
ing the impacts of economic status, medical insurance cover-
age, the duration of treatment, and other biases are needed if
the efficacy of WBCT is to be firmly established.
Conclusion
When advanced NSCLC patients were treated with WBCT,
this therapy significantly prolonged the survival time for
those who had previously undergone conventional treat-
ment and those who had ECOG PS <3. In the future, more
controlled clinical trials with larger samples and with com-
parisons to other treatments are needed.
