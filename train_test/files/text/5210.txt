Introduction
In its recent poll, NoiPolls (2016)1 asserts that most Nigerians
were of the opinion that the English language is declining in
Nigeria. In fact 68% of the participants agreed that compre-
hension has declined in the last decade. It further reports that
the reading culture in Nigeria is so abysmal that only 4%
Nigerians read at least a book or a piece of literary material a
day. They (the participants in the poll) blamed the decadence
on "poor educational system" and "cultural influence." Some
of the recommendations in the report are that English lan-
guage should be made a requisite recruitment criterion and
reading should be encouraged. The message here is not so
much the decline of an official language as the exposition on
the decaying literacy level in the country.
In 2013, participants of the famous Lagos Book Club2
note that candidates writing literature in English lacked
familiarity with the texts examined; they assert that the can-
didates narrated "when they should be discussing, analysing
. . . or explaining specific notions . . . opinions and assertions
etc."; that they generally deviated from the questions. One
important recommendation from the club is the "need to
raise the standard of teaching literature in Nigerian schools."
One way of doing this is to introduce new approaches to
teaching literature, hence the need for the current research.
Interestingly, many years before the findings of NoiPolls
and the reports from Lagos Book Club, many researchers in
Nigeria had commented on the continuous fall of the English
language proficiency among Nigerian secondary school stu-
dents (e.g., Afolayan, 1984; Onukaogu, 2012; Uba, Oteiku,
& Abiodun-Eniayekan, 2016). Similarly, some scholars such
as Oguntuase (1990), Obemeata (1995), Oladoyin (2006),
and Uba et al. (2016) have noticed a similar trend among

A Research-Based Evidence of the
Effect of Graphic Organizers on the
Understanding of Prose Fiction
in ESL Classroom

Abstract
Graphic organizers (GOs) are fast becoming acceptable standard instructional tools across subjects in the education arena
globally. However, this visual representation of information is yet to be recognized and integrated into the teaching methods
in Nigerian schools. This study, therefore, presents a research-based investigation of the usefulness of GOs in the appreciation
of prose literature in Nigeria, with a view to foregrounding their use in Nigerian schools. Specifically, the study seeks to find
out whether senior secondary students in prose literature-in-English in Nigeria who are taught with GOs perform better
in prose and comprehension assessments. Four project secondary schools with total of 100 students were purposively
selected for the study. The schools were grouped into two: graphic-based schools (GBS) and non-graphic-based schools
(NGBS). Whereas the GBS was exposed to instruction via eight graphic organizers, the NGBS served as control. Subjected
to descriptive statistics and one-sample t test analysis, the investigation reveals that graphic organizers make students take
charge of the learning process in prose literature classes, and it concludes that these visual instructional elements guarantee
student understanding and achievement. The study, thus, recommends the incorporation of graphic organizers in the teaching
and learning processes across subjects in Nigerian schools.

postsecondary school students in the country. As in the
NoiPolls' recommendations, the counsel that runs as leitmo-
tif in the works of these scholars is the enhancement or pro-
motion of good reading culture. Incidentally, one sure way of
enhancing the reading capacity of the English as a second
language (ESL) learner speakers is through literature immer-
sion. As noted by Uba et al. (2016), having literature-in-Eng-
lish in the academic curriculum in Nigeria is one thing, but
teaching it successfully to students is entirely a different
thing. For students to maximally benefit from literature les-
sons, they (the lessons) have to be organically composed and
presented. One way of making literature interesting and
engaging to students is by making it visually and tactilely
appealing to them. An interesting approach to achieving this,
however, is through the use of graphic organizers (see
Alshatti, 2012; Claggett, 1992; Lovitt, 1994; Marzano,
Pickering, & Pollock, 2005; Onukaogu, 2012; Sam & Rajan,
2013; Uba et al., 2016), hence the current investigation.
The significance of literature in the teaching of reading
comprehension has been studied for many years by scholars
around the world with findings ranging from those declaring
it vital to enhancing students' cognitive abilities in English
language learning process (see Shokrolahi, 2014; Suleyman,
Nurdan, Mehtap, & Arzu, 2013; Ozkan & Tongur, 2014;
Ulbrich, 2013) to others decrying it as redundant or imped-
ing students' performance at reading and understanding
comprehension of English (Ashley, 2015; Rascher, 2015).
For clarification, literature is used here in its strict sense to
mean any fictional or imaginative writing that can be catego-
rized into any of the three major genres of literature--poetry,
prose fiction, and drama. However, in this study, the focus is
on prose fiction. Compared with other forms, literary writ-
ings are not only "distinguished in form, expression and
emotional power," but also they have "evaluative as well as
descriptive functions" (Abrams & Harpham, 2005, p. 153).
Literature enhances the language capacity of learners.
Therefore, if the teaching of literature is enhanced in Nigerian
schools, there is the tendency that students'English language
proficiency will be improved. The authors believe that this
would complement the effectiveness of graphic organizers
on the understanding of prose fiction.
The study is set to achieve two main objectives, which are
(a) to ascertain the perception of literature-in-English teach-
ers and students of the role of GOs in improving teaching and
learning of prose, and (b) to find out whether the perfor-
mance of students taught with GOs would be better than
those students taught without GOs. To this end, the authors
hypothesize that senior secondary school students in Nigeria
who are taught with GOs in prose literature-in-English do
not perform better in prose and comprehension tests than
their counterparts who are not taught with GOs.
Graphic Organizers and Learning
Also known as cognitive maps or content webs or concept
maps, graphic organizers are visual and kinetic display of
information designed for the benefit of all classes of learners.
They are drawings that use geometric shapes or tables to show
the relations between various pieces of information (Zwiers,
2004). There are several types of graphic organizers explained
by many scholars. Some of them are attribute chart, story map,
main idea and detail chart, cause and effect diagram, Venn dia-
gram, flow diagram, sequence chart, concept map, big ques-
tion map, circle organizer, discussion map, and so forth (for
further explanation, see Alshatti, 2012; Bellanca, 2007; Fisher
& Schumaker, 1995; Merkley & Jeffries, 2000; Uba et al.,
2016).3 Irrespective of the type of organizer one chooses, three
basic factors need to be considered when constructing one.
These are summarized by Baxendell (2003) as follows:
a. Coherence: Every organizer should be designed in
such a way that distractions are eliminated. The con-
nections it explicates should be clearly labeled and
the information covered should be minimal.
b. Creativity: Graphic organizers should be innova-
tively constructed to inspire learners' interest. They
should also meet the aesthetic desires of the learners.
Enough room for illustrations is to be created when
constructing graphic organizers.
c. Consistency: To achieve reliability and dependabil-
ity, graphic organizers should be standard and regu-
larly introduced into the classroom. Standardization
here means that they should be within the cognitive
perception of the target learners.
The literature is enriched with many studies that have
focused on GOs and their effects on students learning ability.
For example, Miranda (2011, p. 95) examines the effects of
GOs on the reading comprehension of one female with learn-
ing disability. The finding of that study indicates that GOs
are "an effective reading comprehension intervention for the
ELL with LD." The studies of Kim, Vaughn, Wanzek, and
Wei (2007) and Manoli and Papadopoulu (2012) maintain
that the use of GOs enhances reading comprehension among
learners with disability. Similarly, Gallavan and Kottler
(2007) admit that the use of GOs enhances learners' short-
term memory and long-term achievement because they
enable them to manipulate ideas and help them summarize
concepts. Whereas, Tang (1992) admits that GOs "facilitate
the acquisition of a second language" (p. 189), Jiang and
Grabe (2007) remark that "a serious remaining concern is the
lack of graphic organisers research with L2 students" (p. 46).
This study provides data from the L2 perspective.
Method
Research Design
The current study employs a transversal study design carried
out chiefly through observation and analysis of the data col-
lected from a sample comprising 100 senior secondary
school4 students.
Uba et al. 3
Participants
The research participants were 100 senior secondary stu-
dents from four private secondary schools in Ife Central
Local Government, Osun State, Nigeria. There were more
than 100 students offering literature-in-English in the
selected schools. However, for equal representation, 25 stu-
dents were taken from each school on the following basis:
1. Five students who were adjudged to be in the "A"
performance category;
2. Five students in the "B" category;
3. Five students in the "C" category;
4. Five students in the "D" category;
5. Five students in the "E/F" category.
This was done with the help of the principals and the
teachers in the schools. All the participants spoke English as
a second language and any of Yoruba, Igbo, Ijaw, and Hausa.
Only about 12.6% of the students studying literature did so
for the love of reading, the rest studied literature because it
was a requisite subject in the course they wanted to read in
the university. The project schools were grouped into two.
Group 1 comprised two schools that used graphics in the
teaching of literature-in-English (graphic-based schools
[GBS]), while Group 2 consisted of two schools that did not
use graphics in their teaching of literature-in-English (non-
graphic-based schools [NGBS]). The project schools were
not only government approved but were also West African
Examinations Council (WAEC) approved. They all operated
on the same literature curriculum. Although the schools did
not have the same number of literature teachers, all the teach-
ers were university graduates and had been teaching litera-
ture-in-English for more than 4 years before the research.
Instruments
Three main instruments were used during the study. The first
instrument was a graphic observation checklist comprising
seven graphic organizers (GOs); these were the Big Question
Map, Circle Organizer, Discussion Map, Compare-Contrast
Matrix, Venn Diagram, Cause and Effect, Story Map and
Time Line (Alshatti, 2012). They were introduced to the lit-
erature teachers in the two GBS by the researchers. The
researchers trained the teachers on how and when to use a
particular GO for effective results. The second instrument
constituted four unseen prose passages that were adminis-
tered to the subjects to ascertain their key elements in litera-
ture-in-English prose texts. Two passages were used to
design 15 objective questions for pretest, and the other two
were used to design another 15 objective questions for post-
test. They were used to ascertain the subjects' understanding
of the contents of the texts. All the four prose passages came
from The Last Duty (Okpewho, 2010). This text was used
because it was the recommended text for senior secondary
school literature in Nigeria as at the time of the research.
There were also four passages for reading comprehension,
which were of the same readability level of the students. Two
passages were used to design 15 objective questions for the
pretest, and the other two passages were used for the design
of another 15 objective questions for the posttest. All the pas-
sages were designed to ascertain their literal, inferential,
critical, and creative reading skills. The third instrument was
a structured classroom interaction observation schedule (see
the appendix), which was a modified version of Onukaogu
(1994) classroom interaction analysis schedule. This was
used in coding the interactions in the classrooms for only
prose literature-in-English.
Procedure
All the literature-in-English teachers in the GBS were trained
by the researchers for a period of 3 weeks on
a. How to use the checklist to identify and use graphics in
their literature-in-English lessons. After the training,
their performances were evaluated by the researchers;
b. How to fill the sections of the structured classroom
interaction observation schedule that were applicable
to them.
The teachers in the GBS taught prose literature using GOs
for two terms, a period that was equivalent to 8 months. The
teachers in the NGBS taught the same aspect of literature
without using any graphic organizer.
Two unseen prose passages (with 15 objective questions)
and two comprehension passages (with 15 objective ques-
tions) were administered to all the students in the project
schools (GBS and NGBS) before the treatment began.
Administration of another set of 30 objective questions took
place at the end of the second term in the form of posttest. The
performance of the students in each of the tests was classified
following Onukaogu's (1994) criteria for ease of comparison:
1. 1% to 39%. This reflects the performance of students
who were considered to be below average in their test
ability.
2. 40% to 59%. This reflects the performance of the stu-
dents who were considered to be just average in their
test ability.
3. 60% to 69%. This reflects the performance of stu-
dents who were considered to be above average in
their test ability.
4. 70% to 100%. This reflects the performance of stu-
dents who were considered excellent in their test
ability.
The Pretests
Before the treatment, all the 100 participating students
answered 30 objective questions from two unseen prose texts
4 SAGE Open
and two comprehension passages. The descriptive statistics
of the results of the tests are presented in Table 1.
These tests were administered to register participants'
degree of prose appreciation and comprehension capacity
before being introduced to the GOs. The tests comprised 30
objective questions quintessential of the Senior Secondary
School Certificate Examinations questions.
Treatment
All the participating schools had two literature-in-English
teachers, one for senior secondary students and the other for
the junior classes. The timetables from all the schools indi-
cated that literature-in-English was taught twice a week.
However, the days of the week and time of the day for the
subject differed from school to school. All the subjects partici-
pated in tutorial classes on Fridays (in the evening) and
Saturday (from 8:00 a.m. till 6:00 p.m.) in preparation for the
Senior Secondary Certificate Examinations (roughly equiva-
lent to General Certificate of Education [GCE]). Whereas the
teachers in the NGBS taught their students in the traditional
way, their counterparts in GBS employed different GOs in
teaching literature-in-English. All the genres of literature were
taught using GOs in GBS; the researchers recorded activities
in prose classes only. They also used GOs in class discussions
and in doing some of their homework assignments.
Posttests
Another set of 30 objective questions (from two unseen
prose texts and two comprehension passages) were pre-
sented to all the participants in both GBS and NGBS. The
results are presented and discussed in the "Results and
Discussion" section below.
Data Analysis
Before subjecting the data to descriptive and inferential sta-
tistics, a frequency count of all the interactions was taken.
Based on the overall interactions, single-sample t test analy-
ses of the performance of all the students in the tests were
computed. The analyses were carried out on a hypothesized
means of 2.2 for the prose test, and 2.28 for the comprehen-
sion. These figures served as the test values for the compari-
sons of means. There was no relationship between the scores
on the test variables, no outliers, and the size of the sample
was moderate enough that a slight violation of normality
might still yield accurate p values.
Results and Discussion
The means were compared in a single-sample t test. The
test values were 2.2 and 2.28 for both the unseen prose and
comprehension, respectively. The results are presented in
Tables 5 and 6.
The range of performance of the subjects from the two
groups of schools in the unseen prose test shows that, for the
GBS, 2% of the subjects fall within the range of 1% to 39%
in the test, whereas 22% represents the score from the NGBS.
More students from the NGBS performed below average in
the unseen prose test than those from the GBS. Again, 6% of
the subjects from the GBS scored between 50% and 59%
while the NGBS had 46% of their subjects in the same cate-
gory. This shows that few students in the GBS performed
averagely in the unseen prose test, unlike the subjects from
the NGBS who had almost half of them in the same category.
Furthermore, 7% from the GBS scored between 60% and
69% while in the NGBS 19% were in the same range. In this
aspect, it is obvious that more subjects from the NGBS
exhibited good performance in the unseen prose test as com-
pared with those from the GBS. Finally, 85% of the GBS'
subjects fall between 70% and 100%, whereas 13% in the
NGBS were within the same range. This indicates that a high
number of subjects from the GBS performed excellently in
the test, whereas a lesser number of students from the NGBS
did so. In comparison, the non-graphic-based subjects were
fairly spaced between the first three levels of performances
with the least population in the very high performance cate-
gory. This distinguishes the graphic-based students as very
high achievers unlike the non-graphic-based students.
A similar trend played out in the performance of the two
groups in the comprehension tests. The data show that for the
GBS, 3% of the subjects fall within the range of 1% to 39%
in the test and 19% from the nongraphic schools fall within
the same range. This shows that more subjects from the
NGBS performed poorly in the comprehension test than the
GBS. Similarly, 13% of the subjects from the GBS scored
between 50% and 59% while 47% of students in the NGBS
were found in the same group. Here again, more subjects
from the NGBS performed above average in the comprehen-
sion test than their colleagues from the GBS. Furthermore,
11% from the GBS scored between 60% and 69% while in
the NGBS, 22% had the same score range. Here again, more
subjects from the NGBS were found in this group than those
from the GBS, that is, a higher percentage of the NGBS

performed well in the comprehension test as compared with
their counterparts from the GBS. However, 73% of the GBS'
subjects scored between 70% and 100%, whereas 12% from
the NGBS scored within the same range. Just as what hap-
pened in the unseen prose tests, there was more number of
students from the GBS who performed excellently in the test.
From the data, it is clear that among the low grades, about the
same number of participants from the two groups scored
between 1% and 69%. However, the GBS had a higher num-
ber of subjects who performed excellently in the tests.
The finding, thus, shows that the GBS had less students in
the low score level to average and good performance, with
the majority in the very high performance category, whereas
the NGBS had majority in the low to average and good per-
formance, with very few in the very high performance cate-
gory. This distinguishes students from the GBS as students
with high level of comprehension ability, which can be
attributed to the use of graphic organizers as a tool in their
learning process.
The comparison of the mean performances of students
from the GBS and the NGBS, displayed in Tables 1 and 4
above, clearly shows that subjects from the GBS had
greater means in the posttests in both unseen prose and
comprehension than in the pretests. Whereas, the results
from the t test analysis indicate a p value of <.05 for the
GBS in both unseen prose and comprehension, while that
of the NGBS is >.05. With this t test result, the hypothesis
that senior secondary school students in Nigeria who are
taught with GOs in prose literature-in-English do not per-
form better in prose and comprehension tests than their
counterparts who are not taught with GOs is, thus, rejected.
Given that the introduction of GOs was the only new strat-
egy exposed to the treatment group, this result would not
have occurred had the GBS not been subjected to GOs. It
is most probable that the subjects in NGBS performed the
way they did because they failed to draw an association
between their prior knowledge and the ideas in the tests
they were reading. This finding is in consonance with the
conclusion reached by Sam and Rajan (2013) that, when
applied appropriately, GOs help to improve reading

comprehension skills of ESL students. And it once again
negates the conclusion by Griffin and Tulbert (1995) that
studies on GOs have been inconclusive.
Although it is established from the t tests that students
from the GBS performed better than their counterparts from
the NGBS in the unseen prose tests and comprehension
tests, it is vital to understand that the use of graphics did not
affect only on the subjects' cognitive development. The use
of graphics also influences other areas of learning processes,
which cumulatively determine the overall success of stu-
dents (Alshatti, 2012; Bellanca, 2007; Claggett, 1992; Dye,
2000). For example, from the results of the structured class-
room interaction observation schedule, it was observed that
graphic-based classes were more organic and interesting to
learners than the non-graphic-based classes. Item 2 on the
schedule (demonstrated learners'attitude) indicated that stu-
dents in the GBS were more cooperative, persistent, inde-
pendent in reasoning, enthusiastic, and responsible to
learning than the students in NGBS.
Similarly, Item 3 of the schedule clearly showed that the
teachers in GBS were not assuming the traditional role of
teacher-know-it-all; rather, they were able to shift most of
the learning responsibilities to their students. They only
provided guides to the learners, motivated and encouraged
them, and praised them where necessary. On the contrary, it
was observed that teachers in the NGBS maintained the sta-
tus quo in the prose classroom: They commandeered the
learning processes by doing all the talking and asking ques-
tions at the end of the class. Consequently, students in the
GBS interacted with each other freely, worked in groups to
provide solutions to problems, and applied literary princi-
ples to real-life issues. On the contrary, students in the
NGBs maintained the monotony of silence typical of the
traditional teaching method.
Again, as for the classroom atmosphere in the prose
classes, it was discovered that in the GBS classrooms major-
ity of the students demonstrated interest in the activities
going on in the classroom and most of them actively partici-
pated in discussions that emanated from the texts studied.
The classrooms were generally orderly and peaceful, which
engendered a favorable learning climate for the students. On
the contrary, the majority of the students in NGBS were fre-
quently off tasks and apathetic to the instructor's activities.
This made the atmosphere in the classrooms too tense for
any meaningful learning to take place.
However, interpersonal interactions with the partici-
pants revealed that the good performance of the students in
GBS was not directly as a result of the teachers' use of
graphic organizers in the lessons, rather, the graphic orga-
nizers made the lessons more interesting and engaging for
the learners, who, in turn, became more enthusiastic in the
whole learning process. The fun aspects of the organizers
made the students learn in a play-way approach, which
invariably contributed to developing their interest in the
classroom activities.
Lessons From the Pilot
Prior to the study, a 4-week preliminary session was carried
out chiefly to evaluate the applicability of the research instru-
ments. During the pilot, many things were revealed to the
researchers, of which the following were the salient ones:
i. Two teachers only out of the 10 teachers of literature-
in-English in the selected schools had heard of
graphic organizers. Interestingly, these two thought
that organizers were for children in stories.
ii. All the teachers in the GBS claimed that the use of
organizers made their teaching very easy and their
lessons more interesting. They, however, complained
that more time was spent in preparing and selecting
concepts for the organizers.
iii. Students in GBS were initially apprehensive of the
first set of organizers introduced to them by the
teachers. They began to relax after a thorough expla-
nation of the organizers by their teachers.
iv. The students' interest was heightened at every new
graphic organizer introduced to them.
Limitations/Recommendations
One important limitation of the current study is that all the sub-
jects were drawn from the same local government area in south-
west Nigeria. There is the need to expand the sample to include
more subjects from other sections of the country. Second, the
pretest and posttest questions were solely objective. The authors
therefore recommend that further research be conducted with
subjective assessment format. Again, the comprehension pas-
sages used in this study were descriptive; further studies should
be conducted using expository passages, with unfamiliar com-
plex concepts, vocabulary, and organizational structure.
Conclusion
The authors of this study are not, however, saying that GOs
are the best methods in improving teaching and learning of
prose literature in Nigeria; rather, their position is that incor-
porating GOs in schools will enhance the quality of literature
instruction in Nigerian schools. What the GOs did for the
students in the study was to make the teaching and learning
experiences a reflective one. The students, from the class-
room interaction observation analysis, became more inter-
ested in the literature classes as a result of the GOs'interactive
nature. Therefore, straightforward graphic organizers should
be integrated into the curriculum. The findings of this study
have left us with no better conclusion than to state that litera-
ture not only plays a significant role in language learning, but
it also can be better taught and learned through the use of
graphic organizers.The contributions of Moore and Readence
(1984), Onukaogu (2012), Lovitt (1994), Alshatti (2012),
and Sam and Rajan (2013) support this conclusion. Graphics
Uba et al. 7
act as a catalyst to comprehension of literary texts as they
help to stimulate ESL learners' interest in the texts. With the
use of graphics in the classroom, the lesson becomes more
interactive. Classroom interaction is known to helping learn-
ers to build confidence as they navigate and negotiate the
learning process.
