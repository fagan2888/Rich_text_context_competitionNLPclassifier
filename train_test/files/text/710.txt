Background. Few studies have investigated the prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence in older African American
women. Comparisons of findings with those for older Caucasian women could provide important clues to the etiology of uri-
nary incontinence and be used in planning screening programs and treatment services.
Methods. Data are from the first wave of the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study.A nation-
ally representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults 70 years of age and older was interviewed. African Americans were
oversampled to ensure that there would be enough minority respondents to compare findings across racial groups.
Results. A statistically significant relationship was found between race and urinary incontinence in the previous year:
23.02% of the Caucasian women reported incontinence, compared with 16.17% of the African American women. Other factors
that appear to increase the likelihood of incontinence include education, age, functional impairment, sensory impairment,
stroke, body mass, and reporting by a proxy. Race was not related to the severity (as measured by frequency) of urine loss
among incontinent older women.
Conclusion. This study identifies or confirms important risk factors for self-reported urinary incontinence in a national con-
text, and suggests factors leading to protection from incontinence. Race is found to relate to incontinence, with older African
American women reporting a lower prevalence.
TTis well established that urinary incontinence is a common
1.health problem among older adults. However, knowledge
aboutthe risk factorsfor developingincontinenceis incomplete,
and the findingshave been somewhatinconsistent(1).At a min-
imum, it is important to determine whether the prevalence of
urinary incontinence varies across population subgroups (such
as men compared to women, older adults compared to younger
adults, and African Americans compared to Caucasians).
Findings of demographic differences in the prevalence of uri-
nary incontinence could provide important clues to the etiology
of the condition and be used to better plan screening programs
and treatmentservices.
Race is known to be a strongpredictorof health status(2).For
example, the age-adjusted mortality rate for African Americans
exceeds that for Caucasians (3). However,such rates may mask
importantinterracialdifferencesfor particularhealth conditions.
Todate,relativelyfew studieshaveinvestigated race as a riskfac-
torfor urinaryincontinence.(4).
Earlier studies suggest that urinary incontinence may be less
common among African American women than Caucasian
women.A large-scaleepidemiologicproject, the North Carolina
component of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic
Studies of the Elderly (EPESE), found that African American
womenwerelesslikelythanCaucasianwomento reportanydiffi-
culty holding their urine (5). [The percentages of African
Americanand Caucasianwomenreportingdifficulty "mostof the
time" or "all of the time" were very similar,however(5).]Burgio
andher colleagues (6)interviewed 541middle-agedwomen(91%
of whom were Caucasian), and found that Caucasian women
were more likely than African American women to report both
regular and occasional urine loss. Similarly,unpublished results
from the Medical, Epidemiologic, and SocialAspects of Aging
(MESA) study (7) showedthat 39% of 1,054Caucasian women
60 yearsof ageand olderwereincontinentin the previousyear,as
compared with 23% of 86African American women in that age
group (X2 = 8.38,dj= l,p < .01).Tworecentstudiesprovidefur-
ther supportfor findings of lowerprevalence ratesamongMrican
Americanwomen(8,9).Theseresultscanbe comparedwiththose
of Bump (10),who reportedno significant racialdifferencein the
prevalence of urinary incontinence for his clinical sample, but
found differences in the distributions of symptoms, conditions
causingurinaryincontinence, andriskprofiles.
Most studies of racial differences in urinary incontinence in-
volve patient or localizedcommunity samples.These have been
instructive, but a national sample offers the opportunity to gen-
eralize findings.Further,comparisons of racial groups are often
limited by small sample sizes. The number of minority respon-
dents in typical survey samples may be too small to produce re-
liable prevalenceestimates. In this article,the data come from a
national sample of noninstitutionalized older adults that was
specifically designed to include large numbers of minority re-
spondents. We compare the prevalence and severity (as mea-
sured by frequency) of urinary incontinence among elderly
African American and Caucasian women, and investigate the
relationship between race and incontinence while controlling
for other possiblerisk factors.

METHODS
These data are from the first wave of the Asset and Health
Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study. AHEAD is
a biennial survey of a cohort of noninstitutionalized people 70
years of age and older in the coterminous United States. It is
funded by the National Institute on Aging to examine the health
status and economic situation of the oldest Americans. Half of
the core sample of persons aged 80 and older was selected from
a list of Medicare enrollees provided by the Health Care
Financing Administration. The other half of those aged 80 and
older plus those aged 70-79 were sampled using an area proba-
bility design, with oversampling in certain areas to increase the
numbers ofminority respondents.
The data were collected from October 1993 through July
1994. Trained interviewers from the University of Michigan's
Survey Research Center recorded the interviews on laptop com-
puters. Unless a respondent requested otherwise, telephone in-
terviews were conducted with 70-79-year-old respondents,
whereas face-to-face interviews were conducted with those 80
years of age and older. Proxy respondents were used to collect
information for sampled respondents who were unable to an-
swer the survey questions for themselves. Although issues of
data quality arise, the use of proxies is often preferable to ac-
cepting the bias that may be introduced by missing information
on the frailest and most impaired of the sample population. A re-
sponse rate of 80.4% was achieved. Interviews were conducted
in English or Spanish. In developing the Spanish version ofthe
questionnaire, items were translated and then back-translated.
The sample consisted of 655 non-Hispanic African American
women and 3,566 non-Hispanic Caucasian women. Because of
missing data on one or more correlates, the analyses were re-
stricted to the 606 non-Hispanic African American women and
3,385 non-Hispanic Caucasian women who were not missing
data on variables used in the analyses. Men were excluded be-
cause of their lower risk for urinary incontinence (11), leading
to smaller sample sizes that cannot support the multivariate
analysis. Racial and ethnic identifications other than African
American and Caucasian were excluded because the small
number ofrespondents would not permit reliable comparisons.
Racial identification was determined as part of the hour-long
interview through two questions: "Do you consider yourself
Hispanic or Latino?" and "Do you consider yourself primarily
white or Caucasian, black or African American, American
Indian, or Asian, or something else?" Every respondent who
self-identified as Hispanic or Latino was classified as Hispanic.
Of the remaining respondents, everyone who self-identified as
black or African American was classified as African American,
and everyone who self-identified as white or Caucasian was
classified as Caucasian.
Urinary incontinence was measured by asking, "The next
question may not be easy to talk about, but it is very important
for research on health and aging. During the last 12 months, have
you lost any amount of urine beyond your control?" If the re-
spondent indicated that she had lost urine, a follow-up question
to assess the severity (frequency) of the urine loss asked, "On
about how many days in the last month have you lost any urine?"
These measures were based on questions used in the MESA
study that have satisfactoryvalidity and test-retest reliability (11).
As a first step in the analysis, we examined the bivariate rela-
tionships between race and the prevalence and severity of uri-
nary incontinence. Because of the distribution of responses to
the severity measure, this variable was categorized into mild
(0-6 days ofurine loss in the previous month), moderate (7-20
days of loss), and severe (21 or more days ofloss) incontinence.
We then combined these two measures into a single indicator
(continence,mildincontinence,moderateincontinence,andse-
vere incontinence) and investigated its relationship to race,
while controlling other relevant variables. These variables in-
cluded socioeconomic status, several suspected risk factors for
urinary incontinence, and whether the data were self-reported
or supplied by a proxy.
Although the measurement of socioeconomic status is com-
plicated by a number of issues (2), education (0-11 years vs
12+ years) and current assets (lower 50% vs upper 50% of
older women) were used as indicators of this construct. The
suspected risk factors for incontinence included age (70-79 vs
80+), difficulty with one or more activities ofdaily living (no vs
yes), sensory deficit (vision and hearing reported to be excel-
lent, very good, or good vs hearing and/or vision reported to be
fair or poor), history of stroke (never had vs ever had), body
mass index (lower 75% vs upper 25% of older women), cur-
rently smokes cigarettes (no vs yes), alcohol consumption (less
than once a day vs more frequent), and childbirth (zero vs lor
more children born). These risk factors were identified for eval-
uation based on prior research findings.
Because of concerns about the amount and distribution of
missing data on the severity measure, we used the multiple im-
putation method (12) to investigate the extent of bias in the
complete case or listwise deletion analysis. Imputed data were
generated by drawing the missing values from their predictive
distribution given the observed values. A variant of the joint
multivariate general location model was used to model the joint
distribution, and the missing values were drawn using the Gibbs
sampling technique. It was also assumed that conditional on all
the observed values, the unobserved values were missing at
random.The details of this method and the software used to
generate the values are described in an article by Raghunathan
and Grizzle (13). Analyses of the imputed data led to the same
substantive conclusions as the complete case analyses using the
original data set. The latter are presented here. The SUDAAN
statistical package (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC) was used for all significance tests in this
study to adjust for the effect of the complex sampling design.
REsULTS
Table 1 shows the bivariate relationships between race and the
presence and severity ofurinary incontinence. There is a statisti-
cally significant relationship between race and involuntary urine
loss: 23.02% of the Caucasian women reported any incontinence
in the previous year, compared with 16.17% of the African
American women. The severity of urine loss among incontinent
older women does not vary significantlyby race, however.African
American and Caucasian older women who have lost urine in the
previous year appear to lose urine with similar frequency.
Table 1 also provides descriptive and comparative informa-
tion about the sample. Statistically significant differences be-
tween African American and Caucasian older women are found
for the majority of variables to be used in the multivariate anal-
ysis. The African American women in the sample were less ed-
ucated, poorer, more functionally or sensory impaired, heavier,

given birth to one or more children, and more likely to be repre-
sented by a proxy than their Caucasian peers.
Table 2 further describes the sample in terms of exposure to
the possible predictors or risk factors for urinary incontinence.
In addition, this table presents the bivariate relationships be-
tween those variables and the outcome measure. The findings
suggest that functional status and stroke are associated with uri-
nary incontinence in a linear fashion. For the other variables,
however, the relationships are more complex. For example, the
findings for education and financial assets suggest that women
with mild incontinence have a higher socioeconomic status than
continent women, but that socioeconomic status declines with
increasing severity of the condition.
Table 3 shows the adjusted odds ratios for the four-category
incontinence variable regressed on race and the other predic-
tors. For race, every comparison is in the direction of a greater
likelihood of incontinence for older Caucasian women com-
pared to older African American women (although the mild in-
continence vs continence comparison is significant only at the p
< .10 level). Other factors that appear to increase the odds of
one or more levels of incontinence relative to continence in-
clude education, age, functional impairment, sensory impair-
ment, stroke, body mass, and reporting by a proxy.

DISCUSSION
Using data from a large-scale sample survey of older
Americans, we found a statistically significant relationship be-
tween race and the prevalence of urinary incontinence: older
African American women are less likely than older Caucasian
women to experience involuntary urine loss. Interestingly, the
severity of loss among the incontinent women-as assessed by
frequency-is not significantlydifferent for the two racial groups.
The present analysis cannot provide a ready explanation for
these findings, however. In general, racial differences in health
can arise from several sources. These include socioeconomic
differentials; differences in medical care provision or utilization;
genetic factors; differences in the ways that health conditions are
discussed and reported; and differences in lifestyles, health be-
haviors, or environmental factors that stem from cultural beliefs
and/or racial discrimination (2,14). Because of the substantive
focus of the AHEAD survey,measures were not available for all
of these concepts to allow testing ofthe various explanations.
One explanation that could be explored is socioeconomic
differentials. A finding of better health for Caucasians relative
to African Americans might be explained by the former group's
better access to medical care or to a healthy environment!
lifestyle. In that case, controlling socioeconomic status would
reduce or eliminate the bivariate association between race and
health status. In the case of urinary incontinence, however, the
African American women appear to be advantaged relative to
the Caucasian women, and this pattern was not found. Here, the
noteworthy finding is the greater likelihood for more educated
respondents to report mild incontinence vs continence. Burgio
and colleagues (8) also found an association between education
and incontinence, and suggested that more educated women
may be more willing to acknowledge this condition.
Previous findings regarding the relationship between age and
incontinence have been inconclusive for older adults (15). In
this analysis, we found that older age is a significant predictor
of frequent incontinence. This pattern is consistent with find-
ings from the MESA study of older adults. As respondents aged
over the course of that study, there was a tendency for inconti-
nent respondents to develop more severe symptoms (16).
In exploring the health correlates of urinary incontinence, it
is not surprising that functional impairment and sensory deficit
are significant factors. Earlier investigations documented a
strong relationship between incontinence and many types of
mobility limitations (17,18). Stroke may contribute to difficul-
ties in locomotion and in the fine-motor coordination involved
in toileting; and/or there could be a direct impact of stroke on
the neurological mechanisms necessary for urine control. Our
finding that a history of stroke relates to severe incontinence,
even when functional status is controlled, supports the hypothe-
sis of some direct impact. Moreover, the finding that proxy re-
porting is related to severe incontinence reinforces the idea that
incontinence is associated with poorer health status. Persons for
whom proxy respondents are necessary may be less healthy
than those who are able to self-report. It is possible that the data
source variable is picking up aspects of health status that were
not controlled by the other health variables.
Our results are also consistent with earlier research on be-
havioral risks such as alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and obe-
sity. Two previous studies showed that alcohol consumption
was not related to difficulty in holding urine (19), or to actual
urine loss (6). Nor did the latter study find a relationship be-
tween smoking and incontinence, although other results have
suggested that smokers are at increased risk for this condition
(20). Of four studies examining the association between body
mass index and incontinence, three found a significant positive
relationship (6,9,21). The fourth did not find a significant differ-
ence between continent and incontinent women for several
indices of relative weight, although markedly high BMI was as-
sociated with a positive clinical stress test (22).
Lastly, childbirth is one of the more heavily researched vari-
ables in women's incontinence. It is reasonable to suppose that
the strain ofpregnancy on the pelvic muscles, followed by the
PREVALENCEAND SEVERITYOF INCONTINENCE M303
demandsof the delivery, wouldweakenthe physical structures
thatsupport urinecontroL Findings havebeeninconclusive, how-
ever. Somestudieshavesuggested a relationship betweenchild-
birthandincontinence (9,23,24), othershavenot (6,25),andone
foundtherelationship onlyamongwhitewomen(8).Ourfinding
thatchildbirthis not a significantrisk factor may reflectthe old
ageof thewomenstudied. By age70 andolder, theaccumulation
of chronicconditionsandimpairments thatcan contribute to in-
continencemay blunt what might have been a clearer relation-
shipin youngeragegroups. It is alsopossible thataneffectis ap-
parent only for vaginal deliveries or only upon stress
incontinence. The AHEAD studydoes not containinformation
onthenatureofchildbirth, noron thetypeof incontinence.
This article identifiesor confirmsimportant risk factors for
self-reported urinaryincontinence in a nationalcontext. Raceap-
pears to be among these risk factors. More research will be
needed,however,to fully understandthe relationship between
raceandincontinence. Ideally, futurestudieswillbe designedto
collectinformationspecificto this topic.As we havenoted,the
AHEADsurveywas not designedto be an epidemiologic study
of urinary incontinence; as a result, our study is limited by the
lack of data on respondents' treatment status, type of inconti-
nence, andduration of incontinence. Furtherresearch on commu-
nity-dwelling populationsshouldinvestigate whetherracialdif-
ferences holdacrossall typesof incontinence. Perhaps addressing
thisissuewouldalsoclarifywhyracerelatesto incontinence sta-
tus but not to the frequency of loss.Additionalresearch is also
neededto determine whether the correlates of urinary inconti-
nencevaryby race: Even withthe largeAHEAD sample,there
wereinsufficient numbersofrespondents to studytheinteraction
ofraceandriskfactors. Moregenerally, research mustbuildupon
anyfindings of racialdifferences to establish why theyoccurand
whattheyimplyforclinical practice andhealthpolicy.
