Abstract
The speed and ease with which we recognize the faces of our friends and family members belies
the difficulty we have recognizing less familiar individuals. Nonetheless, overconfidence in our
ability to recognize faces has carried over into various aspects of our legal system; for instance,
eyewitness identification serves a critical role in criminal proceedings. For this reason,
understanding the perceptual and psychological processes that underlie false identification is of
the utmost importance. Gaze direction is a salient social signal and direct eye contact, in particular,
is thought to capture attention. Here, we tested the hypothesis that differences in gaze direction
may influence difficult decisions in a lineup context. In a series of experiments, we show that when
a group of faces differed in their gaze direction, the faces that were making eye contact with the
participants were more likely to be misidentified. Interestingly, this bias disappeared when the faces
are presented with their eyes closed. These findings open a critical conversation between social
neuroscience and forensic psychology, and imply that direct eye contact may (wrongly) increase
the perceived familiarity of a face.

Introduction
Face perception is the most reliable means of accessing a person's identity without the use of
automated technology, such as iris or fingerprint scans. Yet, there are large individual
differences in our ability to recognize faces (Bowles et al., 2009; Russell, Duchaine, &
Nakayama, 2009) and particular difficulties are associated unfamiliar faces (Hancock,
Bruce, & Burton, 2000). For instance, when Bruce et al. (1999) asked participants to select
a target face from an array of 10, in a classic lineup paradigm, they were only able to perform
accurately in 70% of trials, despite optimal viewing conditions. Moreover, in that particular
study, the photographs and video frames used were taken on the same day, enabling the use
of identity cues from external features, such as hairstyle (Bruce et al., 1999). More recently,
Megreya, Sanford, and Burton (2013) reported that, when photographs were taken months
apart, recognition accuracy suffered even more.
However, despite the overwhelming evidence indicating how difficult unfamiliar face
matching is (Bruce et al., 1999; Hancock et al., 2000; Megreya & Burton, 2006; Megreya
et al., 2013), person-to-ID matching is commonly used to protect citizens against identity
theft and to investigate crime. Kemp, Towell, and Pike (1997) investigated fraud detection
among a group of experienced supermarket cashiers tasked with matching a customer's face
with a picture printed on a credit card. The authors reported that in instances where the
identities did not match but the photograph resembled the card bearer, cashiers only correctly
rejected the identities in 36% of trials, leading to an overall error rate of over 60%. Even in
easier trials, where the card bearer did not resemble the photograph, the error rate remained
over 30%. This error rate occurred despite the fact that the cashiers were aware of the study's
objectives and were presumably motivated to perform well (Kemp et al., 1997). Turning to
forensic settings such as border control, successfully matching a real person to a photograph
is often a matter of national security. However, White, Kemp, Jenkins, Matheson, and
Burton (2014) have showed that even trained passport control officers are not better at
matching identities than university students. In summary, evidence suggests that, even
when the stakes are high and people acquire a tremendous amount of practice, unfamiliar
face recognition is a painfully difficult task.
Present Study
We are interested in uncovering the signals people might be relying on to select a face in a
lineup, other than actual recognition. Eye gaze direction is thought to be a major
sociocommunicative signal among social primates (Langton, Watt, & Bruce, 2000;
Leonard, Blumenthal, Gothard, & Hoffman, 2012; Senju & Johnson, 2009). Seeing
another person looking directly at you is likely to indicate that their attention is directed
at you, while averted gaze implies that the other person's attention is directed toward
something else (Kuhn & Benson, 2007; Kuhn & Kingstone, 2009; Ricciardelli, Bricolo,
Aglioti, & Chelazzi, 2002). Allocating visual attention to direct eye gaze seems to be the
basis for social interaction (Baron-Cohen, 1995; Tomasello & Carpenter, 2007; Tomasello,
Carpenter, Call, Behne, & Moll, 2005), and a failure to do so is a symptom of severe social
disorders such as Autism (Emery, 2000; Klin, Lin, Gorrindo, Ramsay, & Jones, 2009;
Tanaka & Sung, 2016). In regard to person recognition, the direction of a target's eyes has
been shown to enhance or influence memory for faces in old or new decision-making tasks in
both adults and children (Adams, Pauker, & Weisbuch, 2010; Farroni, Massaccesi, Menon,
& Johnson, 2007; Hood, Macrae, Cole-Davies, & Dias, 2003; Smith, Hood, & Hector, 2006;
Vuilleumier, George, Lister, Armony, & Driver, 2005). Interestingly, from a neuroscience
perspective, changes in eye gaze and direct eye contact are particularly
2 i-Perception
provocative--modulating activity in visual system (Madipakkam, Rothkirch, Guggenmos,
Heinz, & Sterzer, 2015; Mosher, Zimmerman, & Gothard, 2014; Pelphrey, Morris, Michelich,
Allison, & McCarthy, 2005; Pelphrey, Viola, & McCarthy, 2004; Perrett et al., 1985; Wicker,
Michel, Henaff, & Decety, 1998). Collectively, these studies indicate that we are sensitive to
gaze direction, and particularly to direct eye contact, but what information does direct eye
gaze convey?
The idea that direct eye contact might signal more to a receiver than the direction of that
person's attention has, so far, only been explored in studies that have examined lie detection,
which have yielded inconsistent results (Vrij, Granhag, & Porter, 2010; Vrij & Semin, 1996).
In this article, however, we have married this idea with the emerging evidence that unfamiliar
face recognition in applied settings is an alarmingly difficult task. Our hypothesis that gaze
direction might interfere with face recognition in a lineup task was based on three findings:
(1) people find it difficult to recognize faces in a lineup (Bruce et al., 1999; Hancock et al.,
2000; Pozzulo & Balfour, 2006; Steblay, Dysart, Fulero, & Lindsay, 2003; Wells, 1993)
and, thus, might rely on superfluous information to make their judgment such as gaze
direction.
(2) People automatically process gaze direction without awareness and irrespective of the
task at hand (Kuhn & Benson, 2007; Kuhn & Kingstone, 2009; Ricciardelli et al., 2002)
and
(3) direct eye gaze has been shown to enhance recognition memory for faces in old or new
decision-making tasks (Adams et al., 2010; Farroni et al., 2007; Hood et al., 2003; Smith
et al., 2006; Vuilleumier et al., 2005); however, it is unknown how this will affect
recognition within a lineup setting.
Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, participants were required to watch a brief movie of a person talking
without the benefit of sound and then determine whether that same person was present in
a lineup of four people. For half the trials, the target was present and we manipulated the
gaze of these targets in four unique conditions (direct gaze, left gaze, right gaze, and upward
gaze) with the expectation that performance in target present trials would be better in the
direct gaze condition. Participants could also make two different kinds of errors, they could
falsely reject a target present trial or they could misidentify a distractor. The number of
misidentification errors that occurred for each distractor type (direct gaze; left gaze; right
gaze or upward gaze) was also analyzed to determine whether there was a systematic bias
toward faces making direct eye contact.
Method
Participants. All participants were psychology undergraduate students from The University of
Sydney. In Experiment 1, we recruited 27 participants in total (12 male; aged between 22 and
34 years of age). The first three participants tested (all female) were given a different set of
instructions from the remaining 24 participants, as part of an initial pilot. Instead of testing
their recognition memory, their responses were used to confirm that the direct gaze stimuli
were the faces perceived as looking directly at them. A power analysis based on a pilot study
suggested 16 participants would be sufficient to find evidence of an effect among four target
types. We collected eight additional participants because the power analysis was based on
Taubert et al. 3
accuracy in target present trials and one of our hypotheses referred specifically to an increase
in the misidentification error rate (i.e., we wanted to measure variance in the false positive
rate across four distractor types). Participants gave their written consent prior to completing
the experiment. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were
naiÂ¨ve as to the purpose of the study. The research protocol was approved by the Human
Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney (Project No. 2015/336).
Stimuli and procedure. The stimuli for all three experiments reported here were makeup
tutorials originally uploaded on to www.youtube.com. We sourced 96 movies depicting 96
different female tutors, capturing a 5-second period of their monologue at the beginning of
their tutorial (without sound). No further editing was performed. These movie files were
presented at the beginning of every trial, during the ``learning phase,'' in the center of the
screen on gray background (see Figure 1).
For each of the 96 movies, we sourced a second makeup tutorial (www.youtube.com) that
was delivered by the same tutor. This second tutorial varied as much as possible from the first
in terms of background, lighting, and clothing. From this second movie file, we took a single
frame to serve as the target stimulus. These static images of the actors either depicted them
looking directly at the camera (24 faces), looking to the left (their right; 24 faces), looking to
the right (their left; 24 faces), or looking up above the camera (see Figure 1). Corresponding
distractors (and the stimuli used in the target absent trials) were single images captures from
the makeup tutorials, and similar interviews, of other female tutors (672 static images in total;
see Figure 1). Although some effort was made to capture different gaze directions without
head turns, inevitably these stimuli often also differed in viewpoint. However, we tried to
minimize these differences by ensuring that two eyes were always visible (the majority of the
differences were Ã 30 from the front most viewpoint). These static images were cropped, gray
scaled, and placed on a square canvas 300 Ã 300 pixels in size. The luminance and root-mean-
square contrast of each stimulus was adjusted to match the mean luminance and contrast
values of the entire image set (768 stimuli in total).
All participants were initially asked if they used the website www.youtube.com to watch
movies and whether they had ever watched makeup tutorials on www.youtube.com.
Although all of the participants were www.youtube.com users, only 16 admitted to
watching makeup tutorials. Importantly, none of the participants reported seeing a
familiar face during the experiment.
The experimental procedure in Experiment 1 is illustrated in Figure 2(a). Each trial began
with a 5-second movie, participants were made aware that they needed to pay attention to the
identity of the person in the movie because they would be asked to recognize them in the
subsequent test phase. After a interstimulus interval of 1.5 seconds (on average), participants
were presented with four faces and asked to decide whether the person from the preceding
movie was present or not. The four faces were presented in four positions on the screen (top
left; top right; bottom left; bottom right), equally distant from the center (see Figure 2(a)). All
four faces were presented at the same size (subtending 5 of visual angle in height) on uniform
gray background. The lineups were constructed so that the targets occurred in each of the
four positions an equal number of times. If they were present, the participant was required to
hit the corresponding key on the keyboard (``7,'' ``9,'' ``1,'' and ``3'' representing the four
screen positions) or, alternatively, they could press ``5'' to indicate the person was not
present. The lineup was present until a response was recorded, then there was a 2,000 (Ã
200) ms intertrial interval before the next trial began. We recorded their accuracy and their
response speed. Each of the 96 movies were seen twice (serving only once as part of a target
present trial) and these 192 trials were presented in a random order.

Participants completed Experiment 1 in a dimly lit curtained booth. The experiment was
programmed in MATLAB version R2010a using the Psychophysics Toolbox 3 (Brainard,
1997; Pelli, 1997). The program ran on an Apple Mac Pro (Lion 10.7.5). Participants were
seated approximately 57 cm in front of a CRT monitor (18-inch viewable screen size) set at a
screen resolution of 1024 Ã 768 pixels with a refresh rate of 100 Hz. Participant input was
recorded using an Apple wired USB keyboard.

Results
Initially, we ran three participants who completed the same experiment but were
instructed to respond differently from the 24 in the main sample. For the first three
participants, this was not a test of recognition memory, rather they had to simply
indicate, under the same experimental conditions, which of the four faces was looking
directly at them (including both targets and distractors; a four alternative force-choice
task with no option to indicate none). All three were able to choose the faces in the direct
gaze condition without fail.
For the remaining 24 participants, the instructions were to study the face in the learning
phase and report whether that person was present in the subsequent lineup. The response
profile of participants (Figure 2(b)) indicated a tendency to incorrectly reject in target present
trials, but also a bias toward direct gaze faces (and to some extent upward gaze faces). After
counting the number of misidentification errors participants made (see Table 1), we assessed
which type of distractor was driving the misidentification error rate (Figure 2(c)). A
significant one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the four
distractor types, F(3,69) Â¼ 9.65, p < .001, n2
p
Â¼ 0.3, justified a series of pairwise t-tests,
corrected for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni rule (a/6). These discrete tests
indicated that participants were more often misidentifying direct gaze and upward gaze
faces than other distractor types (for p values see Figure 2(c)).
Another one-way ANOVA (for repeated conditions) was used to analyze the target
present trials and determine whether the average hit rate differed across the four target
conditions (target direct gaze; target left gaze; target right gaze; target upward gaze;
F(3,69) Â¼ 6.74, p < .001, n2
p
Â¼ 0.23). The follow-up contrasts suggested that participants
were, on average, more accurate (and a corresponding decrease in correct reaction time;
F(3,69) Â¼ 15.51, p < .001, n2
p
Â¼ 0.4) when the target was a direct gaze face rather than any
other target type (Figure 2(d)).
Experiment 2
The results of Experiment 1 suggest that participants recognizing faces in a lineup select
more frequently faces making direct eye contact than faces looking elsewhere. One potential
caveat in this design was viewpoint differences. Although we tried to capture stimuli that
varied only in their gaze direction, it is possible that the earlier result reflects a bias toward
front viewpoints, rather than direct gaze per se. One way to examine the contribution of
gaze direction using the same stimulus set was to repeat Experiment 1 after removing
gaze cues. Thus, in Experiment 2, we compared performance across two conditions; gaze
cues present (eyes open condition) and gaze cues absent (eyes closed condition; see
Figure 3(a)). If the results in Experiment 1 were driven by differences in gaze cues, one
would expect no difference across the target conditions when the stimuli had their eyes
closed.

Method
Participants. In Experiment 2, we collected an independent sample of 16 participants (aged
between 26 and 35; 11 participants were female). The sample size of 16 was determined by a
power analysis of a previous study, thus, we recruited participants until we reached this
number. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Although these
participants were recruited from the same pool as described in Experiment 1, none of the
participants were testing in Experiment 1.
Stimuli and procedure. We used the same equipment as in Experiment 1. The procedure for
Experiment 2 was also identical to Experiment 1 except that there were no ``target absent''
trials and, thus, the participants were not given the option to reject the faces in the lineup.
Instead, we forced them to select one of the four faces present (four-alternative forced
choice task). The target-present trials were exactly the same; however, they were now
referred to as the eyes open trials. Instead of having 96 target absent trials, as in
Experiment 1, Experiment 2 had 96 eyes closed trials in Experiment 2 (see Figure 3(a)).
The test stimuli from the eye closed trials were taken from the same videos that were used
to collect the eyes open trials. We carefully selected the stimuli with closed eyes from blinks
that occurred during those tutorials. Although there was no gaze information in these
stimuli, we captured these blinks when the head was facing the front or turned to left,
the right, or the ceiling (upwards) to mimic the corresponding ``eyes open'' stimuli. Due to
the variability in the source material, the extent to which this was achieved differed greatly
from trial to trial.

in Experiment 2; The lineup arrays used in the open eyes condition were identical to those used in target
present trials (Experiment 1). The lineup arrays in the closed eyes condition depicted the same target and

Results
In the design, there were four levels of the variable ``Target Type'' (direct gaze vs. left gaze vs.
right gaze vs. upward gaze) crossed with two levels of ``Lineup'' (eyes open vs. eyes closed)
both were manipulated within participant. Therefore, we analyzed the average hit rate data
using a 2 Ã 3 repeated measures ANOVA that yielded a main effect of Target Type,
F(3,45) Â¼ 7.3, p < .001, n2
p
Â¼ 0.33, but no evidence of a Lineup effect, F(1,15) Â¼ 2.03, p Â¼ .18,

p
Â¼ 0.12. An interaction between these variables, F(3,45) Â¼ 3.4, p Â¼ .02, n2
p
Â¼ 0.19; see
Figure 3(b), motivated a set of four pairwise contrasts to compared performance between
open eyes and closed eyes within each level of Target Type. These confirmed that closing the
eyes only impacted the direct gaze target trials; participants were more accurate when the
faces had their eyes open rather than closed (p Â¼ .001; a/4, cohen's d Â¼ 1.06). This same
difference was not significant for any other level of the target type (all p values > .0125; a/4).
The number of misidentification errors in the eight unique conditions was also investigated, as
in Experiment 1. The same series of discrete paired t-tests (two-tailed) were used to determine
whether closing the eyes changed the misidentification rate in any of the four gaze conditions
(Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons; a/4). While this was true for the direct gaze
condition, the misidentification rate was reduced when the stimuli had their eyes closed,
compared with when they had their eyes open (pÂ¼ .005, cohen's dÂ¼ 0.85), there was no
evidence that this was true for the right (pÂ¼ .07), left (pÂ¼ .11), or upward gaze (pÂ¼ .03) conditions.
Experiment 3
One question that remained was whether recognition performance in Experiments 1 and 2
reflected an increase in identity sensitivity when faces were looking at the participants or a
selection bias toward direct gaze faces. We addressed this question by running a third
experiment to measure participant sensitivity to the identity signal without distractors.
Method
Participants. An independent sample of 20 observers (12 female), all undergraduate
psychology students at the University of Sydney, served as participants (age ranged
between 22 and 31). A power analysis of a previous pilot investigating sensitivity across
four visual conditions implied that a difference should emerge with a sample of size 9. All
participants reported normal or correct-to-normal vision.
Stimuli and procedure. The procedure for the final experiment was the same as Experiment 1,
except there was only one face presented in the test phase and participants simply indicated
whether it was the same person they saw in the preceding movie or not (sequential same or
different task). Target present trials were used as same trials (only the targets were visible in
the test phase). Target absent trials were converted into different trials. We were careful to
have 24 different trials with a direct gaze distractor, 24 with a left gaze distractor, 24 with a
right gaze distractor, and 24 with a distractor looking up. Thus, in total, there were 96 same
trials and 96 different trials. The timing parameters were the same as in Experiments 1 and 2
(see Figure 4(a)). The same equipment and testing room were used in all three experiments.
Results
Overall accuracy was computed for each participant (% correct across all trials) and analyzed
initially using a one-way ANOVA which yielded evidence of variation between the
Taubert et al. 9
conditions, F(3,57) Â¼ 10.43, p < .001, n2
p
Â¼ 0.35. To further investigate the a priori hypothesis
regarding better performance in a specific condition (i.e., direct gaze), we ran a series of six
discrete pairwise contrasts (two-tailed). There were three significant differences found in the
accuracy data, after the correction necessary for multiple comparisons (a/6). The significant
differences all indicated that participants were, on average, less accurate in the direct gaze
condition (direct gaze vs. left gaze, p Â¼ .002, cohen's d Â¼ 0.78; direct gaze vs. right gaze,
p Â¼ .001, cohen's d Â¼ 0.86; direct gaze vs. upward gaze, p Â¼ .001, cohen's d Â¼ 0.85).
Inspection of Figure 4(b) suggested that participants were less accurate in the direct gaze
condition because of an inflated false positive rate. The number of hits (correct responses in
same trials) and false positives (incorrect responses in different trials) that each participant
made across each of the four gaze conditions were transformed into a d0 score--these values
were then averaged across participants. Sensitivity across gaze conditions was analyzed using
Figure 4. The sequential Same or Different Experiment. (a) Experimental procedure for Experiment 3. In
this particular example, the correct answer would have been ``same'' because these faces all belong to the

(direct gaze and right gaze, p Â¼ .008, a/6, cohen's d Â¼ 0.66). None of the other pairwise
comparisons were significant (all other p values > .09 after correction; see Figure 4(c)). A
one-way analysis of variance of the corresponding response criterion values (c) indicated that
there was a systematic change in the participant's criteria across the four gaze conditions,
F(3,57) Â¼ 32.61, p < .001, n2
p
Â¼ 0.63. A set of planned t-tests (two-tailed) was used to find the
source of the variance in the overall ANOVA. After a Bonferroni correction (a/6), only three
discrete comparisons remained significant, the three that compared direct gaze to another
gaze direction (direct gaze vs. left gaze, p < .001, cohen's d Â¼ 1.35; direct gaze vs. right gaze,
p < .001, cohen's d Â¼ 1.51; direct gaze vs. upward gaze, p < .001, cohen's d Â¼ 1.69). Together
these results indicate that while sensitivity did not greatly differ across gaze conditions, the
participants may have been using different criteria to make decisions in the direct gaze
condition compared with the other gaze conditions. Certainly, we found no evidence to
support the idea that performance with direct gaze targets is driven by increased sensitivity
to the visual signal.
General Discussion
The data across three experiments provide a clear indication that when the direction of gaze
differs among the faces presented in a simultaneous lineup, faces looking directly at the
participant are more likely to be selected. A large body of research has indicated that, for
primates, detecting and understanding changes in the gaze direction of other people is a vital
social skill (Baron-Cohen, 1995; Emery, 2000; Leonard et al., 2012; Tanaka & Sung, 2016).
Until now, the widely held assumption was that gaze is important to read because it provides
information about social intention. More simply put, the direction of a person's gaze was
thought to convey the direction of their current behavior or attention (Baron-Cohen, 1995;
Calder et al., 2002; Tomasello & Carpenter, 2007). However, in studies of lie detection, it has
been argued that gaze direction signals more about a person than the direction of their
attention (Vrij et al., 2010; Vrij & Semin, 1996). Building on this, we hypothesized that
gaze direction might interfere with a face recognition task and our results are largely
consistent with this prediction. We argue that this might be because people find it difficult
to recognize faces in a lineup (Bruce et al., 1999; Hancock et al., 2000; Megreya & Burton,
2006; Megreya et al., 2013) and they automatically process gaze direction information (Kuhn
& Benson, 2007; Kuhn & Kingstone, 2009; Ricciardelli et al., 2002). Meaning that
information about gaze direction is reliably available to participants, even when their
instruction is to recognize a target face. Additionally, since gaze direction appears to be
beneficial when participants are required to make old or new decisions (Adams et al.,
2010; Farroni et al., 2007; Hood et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2006; Vuilleumier et al., 2005),
it could well be the case they rely on this cue (automatically) in a lineup procedure as well.
The purpose of using a highly variable static stimulus set, together with the use of dynamic
videos during the learning phase, was to increase the ecological validity of these findings,
enabling us to draw rough inferences in a forensic context. However, a caveat we would like
to consider is the nature of the static images we used in these experiments. They were highly
variable because no attempt was made to standardize face size, face viewpoint, background
information or principal visual characteristics, over and above luminance, and contrast (such
as spatial frequency content; see Figure 1). Moreover, while we collected data regarding the
perceived gaze direction of the faces comprising the ``direct gaze'' condition, the stimuli in
other gaze direction conditions remain subject to a potential researcher bias. For instance,

we have no evidence that the faces in the ``left gaze'' condition are perceived as looking left to
anyone other than ourselves. For this reason, perhaps it would be better to think of them as
gaze deviants (i.e., not making direct eye contact) rather than three discrete categories (left
gaze; right gaze; upward gaze). Certainly, this phenomenon could be confirmed with more a
standardized stimulus set, where head position (i.e., viewpoint) and gaze direction could be
manipulated independently. Also, we acknowledge that the experience of attending a real life
lineup is different in nature (one viewing vs. multiple ones) and outcome (legal repercussions)
to our experimental set up. Therefore, after having established the occurrence of the effect in
a laboratory setting, it is essential to establish if the reliance of eye gaze as a heuristic in the
face of uncertainty is still present in the same magnitude under a more ecologically valid
conditions.
Conclusion
Based on the present literature, it seems that gaze direction has been overlooked as a
potential problem when asking witnesses to identify a person in a lineup (either live
viewing or in a photo array). Although the current procedure may encourage people to
look forward, the brain is incredibly sensitive to direct eye contact (Baron-Cohen, 1995;
Calder et al., 2002; Pelphrey et al., 2005; Pelphrey et al., 2004) and, thus, if no effort is
made to hold gaze direction, constant small variations can be expected among people in a
photo lineup. Importantly, these results suggest that people are biased toward selecting direct
gaze faces when gaze direction differs among faces, inflating the misidentification rate. It is a
simple physical attribute that, with very little effort, can be standardized among a group of
people and, thus, neutralized as a contributing factor to misidentification error.
