Abstract
Objective: Hyperlipidemia guidelines do not currently identify inflammatory arthritis (IA) as a
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. We compared hyperlipidemia treatment of individuals
with and without IA (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis) in a large
national cohort.
Methods: Participants from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) study were classified as having IA (without diabetes or hypertension); diabetes (but no
IA); hypertension (but no diabetes or IA); or no IA, diabetes, or hypertension. Multivariable logistic
regression models examined the odds of medical treatment among those with hyperlipidemia.
Results: Thirty-nine participants had IA, 5423 had diabetes, 7534 had hypertension, and 5288 had
no diabetes, hypertension, or IA. The fully adjusted odds of treatment were similar between
participants with IA and those without IA, hypertension, or diabetes. Participants with diabetes and
no IA and participants with hypertension and no IA were twice as likely to be treated for
hyperlipidemia as those without IA, diabetes, or hypertension.
Conclusion: Despite their higher CVD risk, patients with IA were as likely to be treated for
hyperlipidemia as those without diabetes, hypertension, or IA. Lipid guidelines should identify IA as
a CVD risk factor to improve CVD risk optimization in IA.

Introduction
The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is
increased among patients with inflammatory
arthritis (IA) (including rheumatoid arthritis
[RA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA], and ankylos-
ing spondylitis [AS]).1,2 This increased risk is
possibly related to accelerated atheroscler-
osis in the context of chronic inflamma-
tion.3,4 Several studies have shown a 50% to
60% higher risk of death from myocardial
infarction and stroke in patients with RA
than in the general non-RA population,5­7
with the standardized mortality ratio attrib-
utable to CVD ranging from 1.13 to 5.15.8,9
An increased risk of CVD has also been
reported in patients with PsA and AS.10­12
Like patients with diabetes mellitus (DM),
patients with RA have a two-fold higher risk
of CVD compared with the general popula-
tion.13,14 Evidence-based guidelines have
been promoted to optimize the CVD risk
in high-risk populations such as those with
DM, resulting in higher awareness of the
CVD risk in patients with DM among
primary care physicians. However, these
guidelines do not currently mention IA as
a risk factor for CVD. Thus, CVD risk
reduction in this high-risk population may
not be strongly emphasized by these
doctors.15
Management of the risk factors for CVD,
such as high cholesterol levels, can reduce
the risk of CVD; however, such manage-
ment may be suboptimal in patients with
IA.16 For example, a recent study reported
that about 40% of patients with RA who
had CVD risk factors were not screened for
hyperlipidemia even after having experi-
enced a CVD event.17 However, few studies
have examined hyperlipidemia treatment
patterns in patients with IA among those
with an elevated CVD risk. We used data
from the national REasons for Geographic
And Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) cohort to compare hyperlip-
idemia treatment of participants with and
without IA, controlling for individual-level
factors that influence utilization of health
services as conceptualized by Aday and
Andersen.18
Methods
Participants
The REGARDS cohort includes 30,239
community-dwelling black and white
adults from the 48 contiguous United
States recruited from 2003 to 2007. All
were assessed with a telephone survey and
in-home visit that included a blood draw
and pill bottle review.19 IA was identified
through medications specific to autoimmune
disease (Table 1). Individuals with IA (with-
out DM or hypertension) were compared
with individuals with DM (with or without
hypertension but no IA); those with hyper-
tension (but no diabetes or IA); and those
without IA, DM, or hypertension. The risk
of CVD was assessed at the time of the
REGARDS baseline following Adult
Treatment Panel III recommendations,
which were in force at the time of the
study.20 The study sample included only
participants with indications for lipid treat-
ment according to these guidelines (See
Appendix for definition of hyperlipidemia).
This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the University of Alabama
at Birmingham.

Variables
The Aday and Andersen framework
accounts for individual influences on access
to healthcare including predisposing,
enabling, and need factors. REGARDS
collected detailed information regarding
many variables within each construct of
this framework.18 These variables were col-
lected at the time of the REGARDS
baseline through telephone interviews, self-
administered questionnaires, and in-home
examinations. Information included the par-
ticipants' age, race, sex, region of residence,
education, household income, cigarette
smoking status, alcohol consumption, mari-
tal status, cognitive function, symptoms of
depression, current antihypertensive medi-
cation use, use of pills or insulin for treat-
ment of DM, and self-reports of a previous
diagnosis of myocardial infarction, coron-
ary revascularization, stroke, abdominal
aortic aneurysm, or DM. During the
in-home study visits, prescription and over-
the-counter medications were documented
through a pill bottle review. Participants
underwent a physical examination including
measurement of systolic blood pressure,
which was estimated based on the average
of two measurements after a seated 5-minute
rest with both feet on the floor. Height and
weight were also measured during this exam-
ination. Blood samples were collected, and
cholesterol levels were assessed in a central
laboratory at the University of Vermont.
Statistical analysis
We used descriptive statistics to characterize
the cohort according to the four groups of
interest: participants with IA only, without
DM or hypertension; participants with DM
with or without hypertension but no IA;
participants with hypertension without IA
or DM; and participants without IA, hyper-
tension, or DM. Logistic regression models
were used to examine the odds of treatment
among the four groups of interest (com-
paring the first three groups to participants
without IA, DM, or hypertension) after
accounting for predisposing, enabling, and
need factors guided by Aday and Andersen's
model of health services utilization.18
Missing information was imputed by
chained equations with m ¼ 20 imputations
and 10 iterations.21 The analysis was con-
ducted using SAS software (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
In total, 39 participants had only IA, 5423
had DM with or without hypertension but
no IA, 7534 had hypertension but no IA or
DM, and 5288 had no DM, hypertension, or
IA. Proportionately fewer patients with
than without IA were treated with lipid
medications (Figure 1). Hyperlipidemic par-
ticipants with IA were younger and predom-
inately women, with lower Framingham risk
scores and lower functional status (Table 2).
The unadjusted model revealed that the
likelihood of treatment with lipid medica-
tions was similar between individuals with
IA and individuals without IA, DM, or

hypertension. The fully adjusted odds of
treatment for participants with IA were 27%
lower than the odds for participants without
IA, DM, or hypertension, or IA, although
the difference was not statistically significant
(Table 3). Participants with DM with or
without hypertension but no IA and partici-
pants with hypertension and no IA or DM
were twice as likely to be treated for hyper-
lipidemia than those without IA, DM, or
hypertension.
Discussion
In this study, hyperlipidemic participants
with IA were less likely to be treated
for hyperlipidemia than were participants
with DM or hypertension, diseases well
known to increase the risk of CVD, even
after accounting for the CVD risk level.
In fact, those with IA may have had lower
odds of treatment than others with a similar
CVD risk but without IA, DM, or hyper-
tension, although the small number of
participants with IA limited the power of
this study. If confirmed in larger samples,
these results reflect a potential gap in the
management of hyperlipidemia for patients
with IA. Because the multivariable models
accounted for individual-level factors that
influence the utilization of health services,
other influences may be at play, such
as suboptimal prescribing practices by
physicians.
Our results identify a gap in the manage-
ment of hyperlipidemia, reflecting the need
for a multidisciplinary approach that
includes rheumatologists and primary care
physicians.22 Clearly establishing which
physician is taking the lead in the screening
and management of CVD risk factors
among patients with inflammatory joint
disease is crucial for a successful approach
to this comorbidity. Indeed, CVD risk factor
management is not commonly within the
scope of practice of rheumatologists, who
may recognize that their patients with IA are
at high risk but may not feel comfortable
managing hyperlipidemia. Because clinical
practice guidelines for the management of
hyperlipidemia do not currently include
patients with IA as a high-risk group,
primary care physicians may not be as
aware of this higher risk in patients with
IA compared with those with DM, who are
specifically recognized in the guidelines.
Inflammation plays a major role in the
acceleration of atherosclerosis in patients
with IA. There appears to be usefulness in
biomarkers that can serve as a surrogate for
endothelial damage, which can lead to
accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients.
One study identified dimethylarginines as a
possible mediator of endothelial damage as

well as a biomarker of CVD in patients with
RA.23 More recently, recommendations
from the European League Against
Rheumatism highlighted the importance of
tight control of RA disease activity and
inflammation to prevent CVD events. These
guidelines emphasize the importance of
screening and management of hyperlipid-
emia as well as other modifiable CVD risk
factors not only among patients with RA
but also among those with PsA and AS.24
The benefits of aggressive CVD risk opti-
mization have resulted in decreased CVD
mortality among patients with DM. A simi-
lar approach may benefit patients with IA,
but our results reflect a gap in the current
treatment patterns.25
Our study has several strengths, including
the use of data from a prospective cohort
that included African-Americans and
Caucasians from rural and urban areas in
48 of the 50 United States. Our study has
extensive patient-level data, including medi-
cations, health behaviors, and physiologic
measures, allowing for control of multiple
possible cofounders not previously reported.
Several limitations should also be noted. IA
was defined using medications specific for
IA, which could have led to misclassification
of some patients, although the specificity of
the medications for IA lessens this concern.
The small sample of patients with IA is
another potential limitation, but the concern
is lessened by the very narrow confidence
intervals around the point estimates, sug-
gesting little variability in the finding.
In conclusion, the treatment of hyperlip-
idemia in patients with IA in this sample was
suboptimal compared with other conditions
known to similarly increase the risk of CVD,
such as hypertension and DM. Interventions
to improve the treatment of hyperlipidemia
in this recently recognized high-risk group
may be needed.
