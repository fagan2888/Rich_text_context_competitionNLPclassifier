A report published that explored Islamophobia in the West
Midlands region of England highlighted two particularly
interesting findings (Allen, 2010b). First was the acknowl-
edgment of a relatively widespread opposition being shown
toward the building and development of mosques. This was
particularly evident in the "Black Country," a colloquial
name given to the former industrialized area to the north of
the city of Birmingham comprising the towns of Dudley,
Walsall, and Wolverhampton. Here, three mosques had been
firebombed in 2009 alone, two of which were completely
destroyed (Allen, 2010b). Second was how social media and
networking sites, particularly Facebook, were being used to
voice and garner support for this opposition. More problem-
atic was the recognition that many of these sites were also
disseminating highly explicit and inciting Islamophobic con-
tent. As the research highlighted, both had been catalyzed by
the unfolding situation in Dudley where since the late 1990s,
some of the town's Muslim communities had been engaged
in an ongoing campaign to build what opponents describe as
a "super-mosque" (Allen, 2013a). While Allen's (2010b)
research paid considerable attention to the prevalence and
manifestation of Islamophobia across the West Midlands
region, the nature of the presentation--a civil society report
targeting policy audiences--meant that although these two
extremely interesting findings were highlighted, they were
not fully investigated. As such, although opposition to
mosques and the growing prevalence of social media were
highlighted as being distinct, little could be drawn from this
or about the relationship that might exist between the two.
Opposing Mosques in Public Spaces
When considered more widely, the building of mosques has
not been without controversy or contestation elsewhere.
Across a number of Western European countries, the propo-
sition as indeed the actual construction of mosques and
other similar buildings has been seen to be increasingly
problematic; many providing a focus for hostility and oppo-
sition as also social, political, and academic scrutiny
(Allievi, 2009). This is true of Britain, in Birmingham (Gale,
2005) and Bradford (McLoughlin, 2005) among others.
Beyond Britain, studies have shown similar opposition in
France (Cesari, 2005), Germany (Jonker, 2005), Italy (Saint-
Blancat & di Friedberg, 2005), and the Netherlands

Anti-Social Networking: Findings From a
Pilot Study on Opposing Dudley Mosque
Using Facebook Groups as Both Site and
Method for Research
Chris Allen1
Abstract
With research highlighting the growing incidence of public opposition to the building of mosques and the innovative use
of social networking, especially Facebook, to disseminate and garner support for such opposition, a pilot study sought to
investigate this in relation to the proposed Dudley "super mosque." Focusing on the Facebook group Stop Dudley Super
Mosque and Islamic Village, members were engaged online to explore why they opposed the mosque. Some of the emergent
themes included planning and location, inclusion and public investment as well as those relating to notions of identity,
heritage, otherness, and Islamification. Overt racist and Islamophobic reasons were also identified. The sense of political
disconnect of members is also considered. Concluding with a contextualization of the findings within the existing body of
scholarly output, in particular the building of mosques and Islamophobia, having recognized how spaces such as Facebook
have potential to function as sites for research and method also, an extended methodological consideration is also included.

(Maussen, 2004). Such studies have also been undertaken in
Switzerland following the 2009 vote to ban the building of
minarets. From further academic inquiry, Stussi (2008)
found that the overwhelming majority of those who voted to
ban minarets did so to make a public display of their wide-
spread anxieties about Islam and the presence of Muslims
rather than having a particular dislike for minarets or even
mosques.
Likewise, Göle's (2011) study found that public anxieties
were in fact being catalyzed by the visuality of minarets and
mosques, increasingly seen to be symbolic of all that was
deemed problematic about Muslims and Islam. Göle
explained how this meant that mosques were being seen as
public manifestations of difference quite irrespective of
whether that difference was perceived or actual. For her, this
was consequential of the tumultuous transition underway in
contemporary Europe, where Muslims were moving from
temporary migrants to fully fledged European citizens,
something that was affecting as much at the regional level as
indeed at the national and local levels. Going beyond the
sheer physicality of the structure, Göle set out to find how
opposition was increasingly being justified on the basis of a
whole range of social, political, and cultural precepts. This
might have been evident in the United States too in response
to the furore surrounding the proposed "Ground Zero"
mosque in New York. As Kilde (2011) noted, what began as
an application for the construction of the "Park 51" Islamic
community center in lower Manhattan in the summer of
2010 was soon latched onto by a whole host of different indi-
viduals and organizations that saw this as an opportunity to
express their "hatred for Islam and their opposition to the
growing Muslim presence in the United States" (p. 298). For
opponents, Park 51 was symbolically transformed into the
far more emotively and discursively charged "Ground Zero
mosque." Polarizing thought and opinion--see Kilde (2011)
for a full exposition of these public debates and discursive
transitions--the site became one through which debates
about Islam, America, terrorism, belonging, patriotism, and
sacredness among others were politically, publicly, and sym-
bolically played out. As such, opposition to the building of
mosques is a contemporarily complex matter, one that
embodies social, political, and cultural relevancies that at
times appear to have very little to do with the physical struc-
ture itself.
Opposing Mosques in Online Spaces
Characteristic to the West Midlands region was the way in
which opposition to the building and development of
mosques was being disseminated and propagated through
social media. Noting the ease with which new alliances,
groups, and networks are able to be established online
(Shirky, 2009), the West Midlands research highlighted how
many of those creating these new online spaces were aligned
or active within far-right and neo-Nazi organizations (Allen,
2010b). A good example was the Facebook group, Say no to
Solihull mosque, which was created and maintained by sup-
porters of the British National Party ("BNP"). With more
than 1,600 members, more than 1,000 messages were
posted on the group's public wall in a fortnight (Allen,
2010b). Other Facebook groups opposing mosques were
also emerging, many of which focused on Dudley. The larg-
est of these (as of the 1 January 2012) had more than 19,000
members. Some of these were deliberately offensive, in
particular the Facebook group, Fuk [sic] the Dudley
mosque, let's build a big fat pig there instead. Although
Facebook has since changed its policy--it has closed all of
the groups referred to in this article since mid-2012--most
of the groups referred to maintained walls characterized by
highly offensive and explicit Islamophobic content. Maybe
somewhat surprising was how much of this content was
accompanied by the names and photos of individuals. As
research has shown, Islamophobic discourses are rarely so
overt (Allen, 2010a) so this is even more surprising because
as Back et al. (2010) noted, the majority of Facebook users
are genuine and have profiles to match. Explicit discourses
therefore become easily attributable. Noting Markham and
Baym's (2009) findings, this could be because of the shift-
ing nature of the private and public online, where private
citizens are increasingly willing to share even the most per-
sonal and private aspects of their lives to indiscriminate
mass audiences.
Despite Facebook having closed all of the groups
referred to here, some have transferred to other social net-
working platforms. Some however have just disappeared.
This is not to suggest however that Islamophobia online has
disappeared. Monitoring organizations such as Tell MAMA1
(Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks) suggest that levels of
Islamophobic discourse online are ongoing and increasing,
especially through Twitter. Despite these more recent
changes, the West Midlands research presented two clear
research opportunities: to explore the opposition being
expressed toward mosques--in particular Dudley mosque--
taking place online via Facebook groups; and to explore
social media as a site as also a method of research.
Recognizing this, a pilot study was initiated in late 2011
eventually running from September 2011 to March 2012.
At the time, a pilot study was preferred as it was not envis-
aged that Facebook would change its policies and thereby
close all of the groups soon after the pilot study finished.
This article therefore presents a critical analysis of the find-
ings from this pilot study while also reflecting on the online
methods and approaches used and the challenges encoun-
tered. Beginning with a contextual overview of the pro-
posed Dudley mosque, the article follows with a section on
methods and approaches before setting out the findings
from the pilot study. Thematically analyzed, the article con-
cludes by contextualizing the findings within the broader
bodies of scholarly evidence relating to opposing mosques
and Islamophobia.

Dudley "Super-Mosque" in the Public
and Political Spaces
In the late 1990s, the Dudley Muslim Association began
exploring sites for a new, purpose-built mosque in Dudley.
Having purchased land on the outskirts of the town, the site
was identified as overlapping with the soon to be built
Dudley bypass. Negotiations between the local authority--
Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council ("Dudley MBC")--
and the Dudley Muslim Association agreed a land-swap on
the proviso that significant building work be undertaken on
the site by the end of 2008. Subsequently in 2001, the Dudley
Muslim Association submitted plans for a purpose-built
mosque. Named the "Pride of Dudley," the mosque included
a dome and minaret as well as a separate community center.
Initial opposition was voiced by a handful of local people
although things escalated quickly once local media and far-
right political groups got involved. Focusing on the size of
the "super mosque," opposition increasingly focused on alle-
gations that the "giant minaret" would overshadow the
town's castle and "Top Church," an iconic medieval church
visible from beyond the town. Opposition also focused on
what was termed the "Muslim village" surrounding the
mosque and how this was perceived as being against the
Christian ethos of the area: as Councillor ("Cllr") Malcolm
Davis put it, Dudley's Christian society (Reeves, Abbas, &
Pedroso, 2009).
Soon after, Simon Darby--deputy leader of the BNP at
the time--stood for local councillor in the town and won
with 43% of the vote. Despite losing the following year,
Dudley remained a key battlefield for the far-right BNP. On
the back of an increasingly vitriolic anti-mosque campaign,
the BNP polled about 4,000 votes in the 2005 General
Election before being bolstered by its post-7/7, "Islam out of
Britain" campaign. A feature in the national Observer news-
paper at the time noted how the BNP were "particularly
determined to sound its knell in Dudley" (Temko, 2006). The
most successful politically, as regard campaigning against
the mosque, was Cllr Davis. First elected as a Liberal
Democrat in 2000, Davis defected to the politically right
United Kingdom Independence Party ("UKIP") in 2005
where he lost his seat a year later. Nonetheless, Davis contin-
ued with a vigorous campaign against the mosque, present-
ing Dudley MBC's Development Control Committee with a
petition signed by more than 22,000 people. That same year,
Davis was re-elected.
ShortlyafterinFebruary2007,DudleyMBC'sDevelopment
Control Committee unanimously rejected refused planning
permission for the mosque on the basis that the land be used for
job creation ("Go-Ahead for Mega-Mosque in Dudley," 2008).
The Dudley Muslim Association (DMA) appealed against the
decision to the national government's Secretary of State who in
turn called for a Planning Inspectorate inquiry in June 2008.
Overturning Dudley MBC's decision, planning permission was
granted.DudleyMBCrespondedbyarguingthattheInspector's
decision granted outline planning permission only and that
along with the need to submit detailed plans, the original land-
swap required substantial building work to have been under-
taken by the end of 2008. On this basis, Dudley MBC took its
case to the High Court to challenge the decision. Immediately
rejected, local media reported how Dudley MBC's opposition
had cost £16,000 in legal fees ("Dudley Loses Mosque Battle,"
2009).
The fallout from the planning debacle undoubtedly gave
impetus to the far-right as a mouthpiece for opposition
(Allen, 2013a). Most prominent at the time was the newly
established and rapidly growing English Defence League
("EDL"; Allen, 2011). Claiming to be the only group
responding to the frustration felt by "ordinary people" about
the ongoing mosque saga, the EDL took its opposition to the
streets of Dudley. Organizing a march in the town in April
2010, the EDL amassed about 3,000 supporters--its biggest
march to date at the time--to protest against the mosque
(Casuals United, 2010). Two months later, the EDL returned,
staging a rooftop protest on the disused building currently
occupying the proposed mosque site. Complete with banners
proclaiming "No to the burka [sic]" and with a week's supply
of food and water, protestors intended to broadcast the
Islamic call to prayer 5 times a day in order that local people
experience how it would be once the mosque was built (EDL,
2010). While the protestors were quickly removed, commu-
nity relations in the town deteriorated.
Despite Dudley MBC announcing that it had reached
agreement with the DMA to develop an alternative site, the
EDL continued to oppose the mosque. Announcing a sec-
ond march in the town in July 2010, Cllr Banks created
further confusion by categorically stating that "plans to
build the mosque were no longer going ahead" ("Injuries as
EDL Clash With Police," 2010). The second march was
marked by violent clashes including the BBC reporting that
six people had been seriously injured when a car hit pedes-
trians ("Six Hurt as Car Hits Pedestrians in Dudley," 2010),
an incident an EDL-run website reported as being a deliber-
ate attack on innocent "White" bystanders by local Muslims
(Opinionator, 2010b). A week later, the local Dudley News
newspaper confirmed that violent disorder had broken out
in the town including reports of gunshots ("Violent Disorder
Breaks Out in Dudley Last Night," 2010). Other sources
reported how young Muslims--the Muslim Defence
League--had attacked cars outside a bar in the town
(Opinionator, 2010a).
Despite outline plans having once again been submitted to
Dudley MBC, these too were rejected on the basis of "techni-
cal issues" and the need to compulsorily purchase nearby
land (Mudie, 2010). Although the DMA announced they
were prepared to exhaust all options to identify alternative
locations, there remains little agreement between them and
Dudley MBC. Despite alleged costs of millions, no site has
been agreed yet, no planning permission granted, nor has one
brick been laid. Dudley mosque remains as distant a reality
4 SAGE Open
today as it did at the turn of the millennium. Yet it remains a
controversial and contested issue. Not only has hostility
toward Muslims been on the increase in the town (Allen,
2010b) but so too have there been firebomb attacks on
mosques on the periphery of Dudley. And although the far-
right has been active in the Black Country for some time, the
proposed mosque has undoubtedly catalyzed them, not least
through the exploitation of new spaces online through which
it is able to voice opposition. It is here that social media as a
vehicle becomes especially relevant.
Anti-Muslim, Anti-Islam Expression in
Social Media Spaces
As mentioned previously, far-right groups had been using
social media to oppose mosques and campaign against
Muslims and Islam elsewhere in the West Midlands region.
The BNP had orchestrated a particularly polemical
Islamophobic campaign via Facebook against the proposed
Solihull mosque (Allen, 2010b):
These [Muslim] bastards will not go away and until we kick
them all out and send them back to their own countries we will
have to continue fighting this war. But every time a Muslim
blows himself up or abuses a white person or tries to take over a
neighbourhood we gain more supporters. Time is actually on our
side and all of Europe is itching to kick these useless perverts
out of Europe. I do not know one person who wants Muslims in
Europe . . . If Hitler hadn't gone and messed things up for
nationalism we would never have let them in. Well the tables are
turning and these guys are toast (p. 162).
As Lee (2000) explained, online spaces appear to afford
individuals a greater sense of security: "the less involved
face-to-face contact, the more likely respondents were to
admit to socially undesirable behaviour" (p. 3). Consequently,
it would seem that this "sense of security" gave space to
some to be more open with their discriminatory and prejudi-
cial views. Likewise, Marham and Baym (2009) explained
how the online spaces continually invert and blur the bound-
aries between the private and the public where that which
might typically be restricted to the privatized spaces now
begin to permeate the public also, albeit those that exist
online. Online spaces therefore create environments where
social disruption occurs: Where what is deemed acceptable
and unacceptable, private and public, legitimate and illegiti-
mate become increasingly blurred. As Markham and Baym
(2009) noted in relation to this, the result is an ever increas-
ing "willingness of private citizens to bare the most personal
and private elements of their lives to mass audiences" (p. xi).
Given that prejudices and discriminations are typically
restricted to the private, it is maybe unsurprising that given
the social disruption occurring, that such sentiment and
expression would appear to be beginning to emerge publicly
online.
Methods and Approaches Using Online
Spaces
The pilot study focused on the Facebook group opposing the
mosque with the greatest number of followers. Identified as
Stop Dudley Super Mosque and Islamic Village (membership
circa 21,000 as at 1 January 2012), a personal Facebook pro-
file was used soon after to join the group. From a research
ethics point of view, it was decided that an open as opposed
to closed or hidden approach to the undertaking would be
most appropriate. On joining the group, a personal statement
was posted on the group's wall giving information about the
intentions for joining and which included full contact details
as well as a link to an institutional webpage. This was ques-
tioned by just one member of the group, someone who as
part of an ongoing communication admitted to be using a
pseudonym to covertly monitor certain individuals affiliated
to the group. While this open approach seemed appropriate,
the potential adverse consequences of doing so were
acknowledged. At the individual level, this included causing
dismay among existing Facebook "friends" as well as
encountering hostility or abuse from group members, neither
of which incidentally occurred. Instead, some members of
the group expressed genuine interest in the study.
Shortly after the initial introduction, a further statement
was posted inviting members to discuss their opposition to
the mosque. Doing so was potentially problematic. Such a
direct and overt approach could have been offputting to some
members of the group, not least because of the sensitivity of
the subject matter. And indeed, this approach did fail to get
any significant buy-in from group members with only a few
responding. In addition to being offputting, it is possible that
such an approach might also have the potential to skew the
findings through the identification and subsequent engage-
ment with those holding stronger feelings of opposition or at
least to be more vociferous with them. Given the Facebook
group was created with the sole intention of opposing the
mosque, it was felt that approaching members to discuss this
would not necessarily be too problematic.
In trying to overcome the lack of buy-in from members,
the next approach was to send direct messages to those who
were most active. As before though, there was again a gen-
eral reluctance to engage. This was interesting because
despite the fact that many were willing to post personally
attributable explicit messages on the group's wall, few
appeared willing to personally discuss them. One explana-
tion might relate back to Lee (2000) and his theories relating
to unobtrusive research methods. In the context of Facebook,
might one-to-one contact be perceived as face-to-face con-
tact? To try and overcome this, a new approach was devised
based on Back et al.'s (2010) observations about the need to
close the gap between the actual and self-idealized individual
on Facebook. In trying to ensure members felt a critical dis-
tance was being maintained, anonymity was offered to those
wishing to engage. Recalling Lee (2000), anonymity was
Allen 5
clearly seen by members as affording them greater individual
protection. It would seem that expressing something to a
known and attributable individual was perceived quite dif-
ferently from expressing much the same to a mass and indis-
criminately unknown audience.
The Back et al. (2010) inspired approach required the cre-
ation of an anonymous online questionnaire. Comprising 10
questions, 3 quantitative and 6 qualitative were coupled with
an additional question relating to consent. Targeting the 50
most active members, direct messages were again sent this
time including a link to the questionnaire and a statement
about anonymity should they choose to participate. Noting
Hewson, Yule, Laurent, and Vogel (2003), this non-probabi-
listic sampling method is not without problem. Most notably,
respondents would represent a dramatically skewed sample
of the population at large, thereby lacking generalizability.
While acknowledging this, this approach remained valuable
given that the sample did not need to be representative of any
wider population. Instead, the research was focused on the
views of a very specific group of individuals for whom
opposing the mosque via Facebook was their common cause.
Such an approach is not without precedent. As Hewson et al.
(2003) went on to note, social and behavioral science
research routinely uses selective approaches to sampling
when investigating special interests.
Anonymity prompted unprecedented results. Having
sent only 50 requests, 65 questionnaires were duly com-
pleted. Given some snowballing occurred, this presented
further methodological problems not least because ano-
nymity meant that it was impossible to differentiate
between those invited and those gained through the snow-
balling process. Equally problematic was that it was
unclear whether those snowballed were members of the
Facebook group. Future research would therefore need to
incorporate safeguards in this respect, to confirm the mem-
bership of respondents as a sample. In relation to the
increased levels of response following the incorporation of
anonymity, most of the received questionnaires were com-
pleted to a high standard. Although arguments and ideas
were reasonably well articulated, a reasonably high per-
centage of completed questionnaires used a form of "text-
speak." A significant number of others were completed
with the incorporation of a very strong Black Country dia-
lect. Some combined the two. With this in mind, all
responses are reproduced verbatim including any local dia-
lect or colloquialisms as also any typographical or gram-
matical errors or inconsistencies.
Findings: Arguments, Themes, and
Analysis
From analyzing the questionnaires, 61% of respondents
identified as male and 39% as female. The largest age group
of respondents identified as being between the ages of 26 and
40 (35%). Another 10% were below the age of 18, 25%
between 19 and 25, and a further 25% between 41 and 60.
The remaining 5% of respondents identified as being above
60 years of age. In terms of location, more than three quarters
of respondents stated they lived in the West Midlands region.
The greatest number of respondents identified as living in the
town of Dudley (37%). A further 25% of respondents lived in
areas adjoining the town, in Cradley Heath, Gornal,
Netherton, and Tipton. A further 11% identified as living in
the Black Country more widely, in places such as Walsall and
Wolverhampton. Another 5% of respondents stated that they
lived elsewhere in the West Midlands conurbation including
the city of Birmingham. Given the vast majority of respon-
dents identified as living in the locale of Dudley, any find-
ings might challenge pre-existing notions about opposition
to the mosque in the town. As the findings from the West
Midlands case study noted (Allen, 2010b), many Muslim
community leaders believed that local people in Dudley and
the surrounding areas overwhelmingly supported the pro-
posed mosque. Maybe somewhat misguidedly, they believed
that opposition emanated from "outside agitators" who were
opportunistically promoting and voicing opposition as a
means of creating divisions (Allen, 2013a). Because of the
limitations of the sample group, it cannot be categorically
concluded that this is not the case. However, given that a
significant percentage of respondents claimed to live in the
Black Country and used highly localized dialects throughout,
it might be right to at least question the "outside agitators"
perception.
From initial analyses, a clear resonance emerged for
opposing the mosque in Dudley with those identified by Gale
(2005) in nearby Birmingham. Most prominent was the
notion that England remained a Christian country, that Islam
was "alien" to England and its heritage, and that were the
mosque to be built, there would be an exponential growth in
the numbers of Muslims living nearby. Some differences
were however apparent. For instance, although Gale noted
how opponents rarely challenged the decision making of the
planning authority, in Dudley, this emerged as a relatively
well articulated argument from a significant minority of
respondents. As one put it,
I am opposed to the proposed building being constructed on the
site at Hall St as the site was designated as industrial land for the
creation of jobs. A mosque does not fit the criteria and was
rightly (in my opinion) refused planning permission based on
planning rules. It does not help when the DMA [Dudley Muslim
Association] say they will press on with the plans apparently
with no thought for anyone's legitimate objections.
The location was clearly problematic. For some, this was
because of the perception that it would have a detrimental
impact on the area as well as the quality of life of those living
there. As another respondent put it,
It's being built the top of my street the cars am horrendous dow
my street I think they should just expand the other 1 and build
6 SAGE Open
sumthink for the kids of Dudley as they are bord n need sumthink
to entertain them or build houses as we are cleanly in need of
more housing.
Given that such arguments go against the findings of
Gale's research in nearby Birmingham, it would be wrong to
conclude that such opposition was anti-Muslim per se.
Instead, what such arguments might highlight is the very
real anxiety that some in British society have about the
building of mosques and of the religion of Islam more
widely. This can be seen in the findings from the British
Social Attitudes Survey 2010 (Park et al., 2010). In it,
nationally representative findings highlighted how more
than half the British population would be concerned if a
large mosque was to be built near where they lived. The
survey also highlighted how a significant proportion of the
population expressed feeling "cool" toward Islam while also
believing that "religious diversity"--largely equated with
the presence of Muslims and Islam--had detrimentally
affected British society. It would seem fair to suggest that
these nationally identified concerns had resonance with
what was occurring in Dudley. As such, respondents from
the Facebook group expressed their apparent anxieties about
the mosque, were decidedly "cool" about it--albeit never
using the term itself--and felt that the mosque, as also Islam
and Muslims, were having a detrimental impact on the town.
Still though, it is important--and indeed necessary--to add
that it was extremely difficult to disaggregate what might be
legitimate opposition and that which might have been rather
more driven by discriminatory views and ideas about
Muslims and Islam.
One explanation for public anxiety was apparent in the
view that both the mosque and the religion of Islam were
inherently exclusive: excluding those who were not Muslim
and thereby the majority of local people. A recurrent reaction
to this was for the need to build something "for all" instead.
Such a reaction however overlooks the fact that this is a
mosque, a building that would be as exclusive to worship-
pers as indeed all other places of worship are. However, the
reaction is interesting, as an integral part of the original
"Pride of Dudley" plans was the adjoining community center
that the DMAstated would be "for all" (Allen, 2013a). Given
that this did not specifically feature in any of the responses,
might this suggest that the original plans were poorly com-
municated, that local residents simply did not believe it
would be "for all," or was it that the views of respondents
merely reflected those of the wider British population?
Trying to disaggregate responses in this way was problem-
atic. Further muddying the situation was the argument put
forward by a handful of respondents which related to the
issue of religion as opposed to Islam specifically:
I don't want to see any new religious buildings being built when
the money and land could be used to build something more
needed and more productive for the whole community.
Such comments seemed to reflect the shift away from
public religiosity in today's Britain more so than anything
that was specifically anti-Muslim or anti-Islam. However, as
with the British Social Attitudes Survey (Park et al., 2010),
when people spoke about "religious diversity" and its appar-
ent detrimental impact on British society, many were using
the term "religious diversity" as code for the presence of
Muslim communities. As such, it is unclear to what extent
such responses might be Islamophobic.
Respondents also referred to the perceived cost of the
mosque as justification for opposition. It is necessary to
stress that it is unclear to what level, if indeed any, public
funds have or would be contributed toward construction and
maintenance, conclusive information has been difficult to
obtain (Allen, 2013a). Although representatives from the
DMA claim that the mosque is being funded entirely from
within Dudley's Muslim communities, there have been con-
flicting reports in local media claiming that the proposed
mosque would require £18 million of public funding in addi-
tion to the legal costs referred to previously (Allen, 2013a).
This and the claims made by the DMA were tackled by one
respondent:
The Muslim community is way too small in Dudley to be able to
raise £18 million. It's too large a project but the capacity of the
Mosque will only increase from 470 to 750. It's not worth £18
million. There are Mosques in Birmingham with capacities of
3,000 or 4,000 which costs half as much and they are in much
more densely populated Muslim areas making the collection of
funds easier. The people that fund Mosques are taxi drivers,
restaurant workers and those with everyday office jobs. No
millionaire is going to wade in with the money and no middle
eastern government would give any money unless it's to a
Mosque in London/ Manchester/Birmingham/Glasgow/
Edinburgh, etc. with strong theological links back to the Middle
east which this Mosque and small community does not have.
Although competing claims have been routinely made
about public funding, it is necessary to acknowledge what
appeared to be very real concerns by some respondents about
the potential or actual public cost of the mosque. When con-
sidered against a backdrop of austerity cuts, an economic
downturn and the fact that some of Dudley's areas are in the
top 10% of those with the highest levels of poverty in the
country (Dudley Children & Young People's Partnership,
2011), it may be understandable why public investment is
seen to be contentious. Given the public nature of the fallout
from the mosque, despite the many refutations put forward
by the DMA as also Dudley MBC, both would seem to have
failed to convince local people that public monies are not
being invested nor that the mosque is being funded solely by
Dudley's Muslims. From interviews undertaken with those
associated with the DMA (Allen, 2010b), it was suggested
that additional funds were being sought overseas to enable
the building of the mosque, something that not only reso-
nates with the comments of the previous respondent but that
Allen 7
could also lead to more public anxiety given what this might
be perceived to mean.
Size was a significant and recurrent feature of respon-
dents' opposition, both in relation to the size of Dudley's
Muslim communities and of the mosque. These were largely
voiced through arguments that pitted the two against each
other. In the 2001 Census, 7,476 people (2.45%) of Dudley's
population identified as Muslim, slightly less than the
national average of 3% at the time (Reeves, 2008). In line
with the national picture, the vast majority of those identify-
ing as Muslim in Dudley were of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, or
Indian heritage. So although the Muslim population as a per-
centage of the town's population was slightly smaller than
the national average, it was not disproportionately so. Of
course, it is necessary to stress the irrelevancy of seeking to
confer any legitimacy on arguments that seek to equate the
number of Muslims with any resultant size or numbers of
mosque. Not only are such arguments misleading but are also
extremely problematic and highly dangerous. Size though
was a recurrent focus, something that respondents clearly
linked with notions of "need":
We have enough Mosque's already! Why build another one?
As a number of respondents pointed out, given the town
already had three established mosques, there was no "need"
for the new, significantly larger mosque. Reflecting on this,
it was again apparent that the greatest challenge in analyzing
the responses was the issue of whether, and if so where,
respondents were covertly opposing the mosque on the sole
basis of being anti-Muslim or anti-Islam, if indeed they were.
One way of trying to navigate this is to consider the
opposition in Dudley with that expressed elsewhere. What
was evident in Dudley was that the mosque was clearly
being opposed on the basis of its visuality as the meaning
attributed to it rather than as mere structural aesthetics
(Gale, 2005; Göle, 2011; Stussi, 2008). For Allen (2013b),
all forms of opposition expressed in relation to the Dudley
mosque had been routinely dismissed out of hand by both
Dudley MBC and the DMA, which undoubtedly created a
highly emotive and politicized landscape. Such a landscape
is extremely problematic because as Göle (2011) noted, the
construction of mosques have become inextricably bound
to social and community constructions that not only reify
social and cultural boundaries but also reinforce the stereo-
types and meanings attributed to Muslims and Islam. This
was clearly evident in the comments of some of the respon-
dents. For example, some posited the idea that the mosque--
and by likely consequence, Islam and Muslims--was
against the "norm" of Dudley. Notions of the "norm" were
variously expressed through markers of culture, value, and
heritage:
[the mosque] does not go with the heritage of Dudley it will
dominate the towns picturesque skyline . . .
. . . Dudley is in the Black Country, known for the Black Country
museum and its history, also the Zoo and Castle. In years to
come it will be known for this proposed mosque . . .
The issue of size was also incorporated within this:
. . . [the mosque is] planned to be higher than "Top Church," is
this a statement?
Much of the early local political campaigning against the
mosque featured this type of discursive argument. From the
allegation that the mosque's minaret would overshadow the
spire of the "Top Church" through to the opposition recently
posited by the EDL about the mosque contravening the medi-
eval nature of the town, the idea that the mosque could never
be a part of Dudley was recurrent. It is interesting, especially
in the light of Gale's findings, whether this manifestation of
opposition first emerged in political campaigns or whether
political actors duly picked up on it following engagement
with local residents. Nonetheless, as Göle (2011) rightly sug-
gested, the visuality of the mosque--more so, what that visu-
ality was seen to represent--was clearly influential in the
way in which opposition was voiced and justified.
It was particularly interesting how visuality and meaning
were combined with other arguments for opposition. For the
respondent who highlighted the idea that the mosque " . . .
does not go with [Dudley's] heritage . . . " or " . . . pictur-
esque skyline . . . " this was voiced in combination with
. . . the Islamification of these shores is not acceptable!! No to
sharia law.
Another suggested something similar but about Muslims
and Islam rather more indiscriminately:
. . . very violent actions promoted by the Muslim community,
this worries me about their intentions . . .
Another respondent associated ideas that were far more
worrying in terms of the visuality and meaning of the
mosque:
. . . [the minarets resemble] look out posts (I know what they say
they are) . . . [the] design of the buildings seem more fortified
castles than spiritual houses . . .
Another gave an insight into how they attached meaning
to the visual aspect of the mosque:
. . . mosques currently in existence would appear to be hotbeds
of extremism . . . media reports have produced what would seem
to be conclusive proof that a great deal of what is preached by
the Imams is filled with hate and incitement to cause harm.
Clearly, the mosque as physical structure was interpreted
as being more than a mere place of worship. Far removed
8 SAGE Open
from the aesthetics, therefore, were a number of different
representative and symbolic meanings that in turn were seen
to require greater attention and urgency. Likewise, these
same meanings were those that created anxieties.
It might be that the culmination of these meanings about
Islam and Muslims became most evident in the recurrent
notion of "Islamification." Especially prominent in the dis-
courses of the far-right for much of the past half decade
(Allen, 2011), the EDL has been one of the most prolific
exponents of using "Islamification" as a means of justifying
hostility and hatred toward Muslims and Islam on what it
believes is sound evidence (Allen, 2011; Marsh, 2009). For
the EDL, Islamification can be seen in "a country besieged
by Muslims, the erosion of Christmas, jihadist preachers,
the banning of nativity plays, halal-meat-only school din-
ners, the marginalization of Englishness, the removal of the
St George's Cross and so on" (Allen 2011, p. 338). Given
that EDL has regularly marched and protested in various
locations where mosques are being built or proposed, it
might be fair to conclude that for them at least, the building
of more mosques is clearly evidence of this process of
Islamification. This resonated with many of the responses:
. . . this is England. We let them in without a problem, let them
live English lives seeing as they are in England and then they try
and turn it into a Muslim Islamic place and that isn't the worst
part, the worst is that after that and when the numbers grow, they
will attempt to overtake the country and win the general election
due to numbers and then imply sharia law and I don't care to see
that happen to my country.
Coupled with the perceived need to defend against Islam
and Muslims, these responses resonated with broader dis-
courses of Islamophobia where Islam and Muslims seen as
posing a threat to who "we" are and what "we" are perceived
to stand for (Allen, 2010a; INSTED, 2007). In the responses
of some, this was applied not only to Dudley but also beyond,
to England and indeed Britain:
Islam is taking over Britain. British people are becoming second
class citizens in their own community.
This response is extremely similar to one made by the
EDL a few years ago: "[the EDL will] not let our culture and
traditions be eroded . . . " therefore justifying the need to " .
. . preserve English values" ("Six Hurt as Car Hits Pedestrians
in Dudley," 2010). It is interesting how the EDL has rational-
ized this perceived need to resist Islamification not just as a
means of preserving "our" way of life, values, and culture
but also to refute accusations of Islamophobia (Allen, 2011).
Quite irrespective of whether they achieve this or not, clear
resonance between the discourses of the EDL and the respon-
dents was evident.
In line with Gale's (2005) study of mosque opposition in
Birmingham, the need to oppose Islamification was also evi-
dent in the way in which Islam--the mosque as physical
manifestation, Muslims as human manifestation--was
repeatedly differentiated from Christianity as a means of jus-
tifying a "them" and "us" dichotomy. Although Reeves et al.
(2009) noted how Dudley's Christian heritage had previ-
ously fed tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in the
town, it was clear that the utilization and accentuation of
Christianity and Christianness as an integral part of "our"
identity was ongoing. Seemingly irrespective of the actuality
of Christian identity, doing so seemed to function by rein-
forcing and codifying the otherness of Islam and Muslims,
something that was evident in the responses. Again though,
this reflected local political discourses. Those such as Cllr
Davis routinely stressed what he perceived to be the differ-
ences between Islam and Christianity. Unsurprisingly, there-
fore, this notion of the mosque going against "our" Christian
identity and, as Davis put it, the Christian needs of Dudley
was recurrent.
Demarcations of "us" and "them" were largely implicit,
expressed through what might best be termed as coded and
covert expressions. For some, however, this was much more
explicit. As one respondent stated, their opposition was
founded on the view that
. . . Dudley use to belong to us White people not foreigners.
Others were more offensive. For them, the mosque would
. . . mean more paki's will commute into the Dudley area, thus
creating a curry infested atmosphere and I for one despise the
cunts.
It is worth stressing that such overtly discriminatory and
offensive expressions were evident in only a minority of the
responses. So although many used markers of Islam or
Muslimness to demarcate "them" from "us," few explicitly
did so through the utilization of racist and racialized dis-
courses. Whether this reflects a shift away from the recogni-
tion of skin color, ethnicity, nationality, and so on as markers
of discrimination remains open to question. Indeed, it is pos-
sible that people might have become rather more nuanced,
recognizing that the expression of anti-Muslim or anti-Islam
sentiment has acquired a much greater social and political
civility than similar expressions against Black or other
minority groups (Allen, 2010b, 2013b; Commission on
British Muslims & Islamophobia, 1997). Yet, as the respon-
dent's comments highlight, in the minds of some at least,
religious and racial markers--Muslim and "Paki"--are
interchangeable if not entirely the same.
Disconnected Publicly, Connected
Online
A final theme to emerge from the analysis did not specifi-
cally relate to mosques or even Islam or Muslims. For many
respondents, alongside various other arguments, there was
Allen 9
the expression of how they felt overlooked or excluded from
public and political debates about the mosque. Quite irre-
spective of the main thrust of their opposition, few respon-
dents expressed that they had been able to find a voice in the
proceedings. So prominent was this sense of disconnect that
almost three quarters of respondents referred to it albeit
through a combination of both explicit and implicit dis-
courses. Some of these are set out below:
Because the majority of people in Dudley don't want it but their
protests fall on deaf ears!
. . . because the local community opposed it, but as per usual no
one listens.
. . . because I support the people of Dudley who are clearly
against it, and the council who also turned down the proposal,
until intervention from the government who care nothing for the
people of Dudley.
From analyzing the responses, clearly, the lack of opportu-
nities arising to voice opposition to the construction of the
mosque--whether legitimate or other--created something of
a vacuum. Although Dudley MBC and the DMA publicly
opposed each other until the common enemy of the EDL
arrived, those wanting to voice opposition found their views
being curtailed and dismissed as irrelevant and in some
instances, Islamophobic (Allen, 2013a). Since the late 1990s,
few opportunities or spaces appear to have been made avail-
able to them where voicing their opinions about the mosque
might have made local residents feel respected and valued.
And as research has shown, the far-right has capitalized on
these vacuums (Allen, 2011). Exploiting the fact that many
feel they are not being heard, those who become desperate to
have their voice heard are increasingly drawn toward those
willing to listen. Given that this tends to be the far-right, indi-
viduals become aligned with them more on the basis of them
having listened as opposed to explicitly supporting or even
understanding their campaigns or ideologies. By doing so, the
far-right valorize those marginalized voices whereas simulta-
neously, those marginalized voices subsequently valorize the
far-right. This was succinctly put by one respondent:
. . . as an EDL member I feel that the peeps off Dudley 'av just
been ignord that's why we the EDL do wot as to be done.
What should be neither overlooked nor underestimated is
that the EDL and indeed others are doing "wot [has] to be
done" not only in Dudley but also in many other places.
Contextualizing the Findings
As a pilot, this research sought to engage Facebook group
members opposing the proposed Dudley mosque to explore
the causes and drivers underpinning their opposition. In
addition, the pilot sought to share preliminary findings
about how social and political opposition functions in the
virtual spaces. As before, however, it is necessary to reiter-
ate the limitations of the pilot not least given the con-
straints of the methodologies adopted and that this was an
opportunistic study. And as many of the groups referred to
here have since been closed, these findings might best be
seen as being largely indicative. Nonetheless, the study
generated significant qualitative data and used in conjunc-
tion with the research undertaken on behalf of the European
Muslim Research Centre, it is possible that the findings
have wider appeal and impact. Evidence of this can be seen
in how the pilot provided new opportunities to re-consider
and re-contextualize existing scholarly literature while
also providing a timely insight into the opposition
expressed toward the building of mosques. Likewise, the
pilot provided findings worthy of consideration and further
questioning as regard the relevance of social media, social
networking, and online tools as both a method and site for
research.
From the findings alone, the opposition shown toward
Dudley mosque clearly resonates with opposition shown
toward the building of mosques elsewhere. Drawing on a
wide range of different arguments and justifications, these
reflected previously identified themes for opposition, in par-
ticular, those identified by Gale (2005): of Islam being
"alien" to English heritage, its Christian identity, and fears of
an expansion of Islam and Muslims in the surrounding area.
Reframing these within a contemporary context, it could be
argued that the findings from the pilot went further than
Gale's study, highlighting a number of more pressing, con-
temporarily contextualized arguments. These included
opposing the mosque through challenging the decision mak-
ing of the planning authority, something that the existing lit-
erature only tentatively touches on. More substantially
though, the pilot highlighted how the mosque--and by con-
sequence, Islam and Muslims--was perceived to be exclu-
sive, a drain on limited public money and resources, as also
being deemed unnecessary and far from "needed" by anyone
in the town, Muslim or non-Muslim. The findings also
touched on the growing public antipathy toward all forms of
public religion in today's Britain, not just that being shown
toward Islam and Muslims alone.
Without doubt, the visuality and meaning attributed to
mosques were extremely important. As Göle (2011) rightly
noted, the public signs and symbols of Islam and Muslims
are increasingly becoming entities on which social, political,
and cultural dissonance and dispute are being projected. As
Göle adds, physical structures such as mosques not only cat-
alyze this but also accentuate concerns about the re-territori-
alization of space and the presence of difference, both visual
and non-visual. The construction of mosques is therefore no
longer a matter for Muslim communities; unsurprising that
many of those who joined the Facebook group seemingly
lived in close proximity to the proposed site of the mosque.
As Göle concludes, mosques are increasingly seen as more
10 SAGE Open
than mere places of worship, instead functioning as cultural
artifacts, representative and symbolic of all that is contempo-
rarily known and understood about Muslims and Islam. And
this includes those meanings that are contemporarily seen as
informing what is wrong or problematic with Muslims and
Islam. Mosques, therefore, not only become inextricably
bound to social and community constructions about Muslims
and Islam but also become visual and physical structures that
seemingly evidence them.
Given the emphasis on the visuality of mosques--both in
terms of physical and symbolic manifestations--a consider-
ation of Allen's (2010a) use of semiotics theory may be
appropriate. While other theories might be relevant--includ-
ing social integration and social cognitive theory, particu-
larly in relation to the online public spheres--Allen's use of
this theoretical frame to interrogate other manifestations of
Islamophobic and anti-Muslim expression would seem to
lend itself to this particular context and associated con-
straints. Referring to "visual identifiers," Allen set out how a
vast array of different markers and characteristics of Islam
and Muslims were being increasingly appropriated as
"signs." For him, these signs functioned by signaling what is
perceived to be contemporarily known, received, and
accepted as valid in terms of the meanings of Islam and
Muslims somewhat irrespective of whether that be accurate
or inaccurate, fair or unfair, and so on. It would seem that the
mosque functions in accordance with this theoretical prem-
ise: as a "visual identifier" signaling that which is perceived
to be known and subsequently accepted about Muslims and
Islam. In the contemporary setting therefore, this becomes
manifested in meanings that perceive mosques to be, among
others, "hotbeds of extremism" where "sharia law" ferments.
Likewise,theyarealsoperceivedtosignalthe"Islamification"
of Dudley and beyond. None was more obvious than this in
the observation by the respondent who claimed the "design
of the buildings seem more fortified castles than spiritual
houses," especially given how the minarets resemble look-
out towers.
For Allen, all those for whom the visual identifiers make
known such meanings have the potential themselves to be
Islamophobic or at least interpret meaning within an ideo-
logical Islamophobic frame (Allen, 2010a). This requires
further explanation and it is here that relevance of the mosque
as not being a part of the "norm" becomes vitally important.
As noted previously, not only was the mosque--in its func-
tion as visual identifier--not seen to be part of the norm but
was also seen to be never able. Instead, the mosque signaled
the perceived threat posed to Dudley and "us" more widely.
Underpinning this was the identification and demarcation of
"us" and "them." Opposition to the mosque "makes sense"
because it is about preserving the self from the threatening
other. As the Commission on British Muslims and
Islamophobia (1997) put it, such processes function in ways
that appear to be "commonsense" despite being divisive and
highly discriminatory.
To what extent then might all opposition shown toward
the mosque be seen to be discriminatory or even
Islamophobic? For Allen (2010a), Islamophobia has to be
understood both singularly and variously in terms systems of
thought, belief, and action that seek to actively reinforce
Islam and Muslims as the "other." Islamophobia is therefore
not necessarily restricted to any specific action, practice, dis-
crimination, or prejudice but can be found in the meaning
that is, at times, both critically and uncritically accepted as
natural and normative of Muslims, Islam, or both. Clarke
(2003) argued that through such ideological processes, a
sense of order is formulated, one that establishes and rein-
forces notions of who we are, or more precisely, who we are
not. For him, this is achieved through processes of stigmati-
zation, marginalization, and intolerance that are necessary to
legitimize "us" as "norm." It would seem reasonable to sug-
gest that underpinning many of the arguments expressed in
opposing the mosque was a formulated sense of order.
Without any doubt, many of the arguments of opposition
expressed by respondents embodied a clear sense of who
"we" are while clearly demarcating the "us" from "them."
To what extent is it therefore legitimate to suggest that any
opposition that accentuates difference might not necessarily be
Islamophobic but might have the potential to be interpreted as
such and thereby fuel the discrimination perpetuated by others?
What the findings from this study suggest is that even where
there is some evidence of an "us" and "them" dichotomy exist-
ing, it would be extremely difficult and rather simplistic to sug-
gest that all those voicing dichotomous discourses were
Islamophobic: discriminatory probably, but Islamophobic not
necessarily, something that creates a series of very real dilem-
mas. For instance, where do the boundaries of Islamophobia
begin and end? Similarly, when are the lines between valid and
invalid, legitimate and illegitimate opposition crossed?
Likewise, how can one know when justified opposition trans-
gresses into unjustified opposition? What the study in Dudley
highlights is that a good number of people--even those who
are prepared to express their opposition in the blurred reality/
unreality of the private/public online spaces--have many dif-
ferent oppositional viewpoints that they perceive to be legiti-
mate, valid, or justified. The vast majority are not, one might
suggest, Islamophobic, anti-Muslim, or anti-Islamic per se; nor
are they even likely to be explicitly prejudicial or discrimina-
tory as indeed the findings might suggest. Yet, when those indi-
viduals fail to acquire a voice and are left feeling excluded,
ignored, and marginalized, it is possible that their views harden,
thereby requiring them to seek outlets--or conversely, "out-
lets" such as the far-right to seek them--to find valorization.
Any ensuing Islamophobia, therefore, may be the consequence
of a transitional process of seeking valorization and not neces-
sarily a start point for many, whether focusing on those joining
Facebook groups or indeed voicing opposition elsewhere. The
reasons for joining and being a member of an online Facebook
group that opposes the building of a mosque, therefore, may
not be as simple as one might presume. More likely, the reasons
Allen 11
are far more complex and multi-faceted and driven by social
and political conditions as much as anything else.
And this is where the irony becomes apparent: that which
connected all of those engaging through the Facebook group
was a sense of disconnect. This sense of disconnect may pro-
vide some insight into why Facebook groups, social net-
works, and other online spaces are being used not only to
oppose mosques but also, more importantly, to encourage
others to do so. As Gurak and Logie (2003) put it,
the highly specialised virtual spaces on the internet make it easy
to join a community and quickly understand and assume this
community ethos . . . often, participants do not have to spend
time making introductory remarks or defending the premises of
their statements. This "instant ethos" makes it easy to reach
many individuals of similar values. (p. 31)
In conjunction with the lack or at least the perceived lack of
opportunities to engage and find a voice in the offline "real"
spaces, it would seem that social media increasingly provides
those immediate opportunities to not only find a voice but also
to find valorization. This will, as Facebook has found since this
research was undertaken, require a constant process of scrutiny
and revision to try and ensure that those "individuals of similar
values" have fewer opportunities to form communities that
have the potential to foster and promote discrimination, big-
otry, and hatred. And it is here that notions of opposition
become relevant once more. As Shirky (2009) noted,
. . . when it becomes simple to form groups, we get both the
good and the bad ones. This is going to force society from
simply preventing groups from forming to actively deciding
which existing ones to try to oppose . . . (p. 21)
It is therefore likely that groups opposing others that
oppose will be undoubtedly necessary.
