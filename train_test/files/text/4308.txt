Abstract
Despite our extensive knowledge of the structure of negatively charged cell surface proteoglycans and sialoglycoconjugates in
the brain, we have little understanding of how their negative charge contributes to brain function. We have previously shown
that intensely photoluminescent 9-nm diameter quantum dots (QDs) with a CdSe core, a ZnS shell, and a negatively charged
compact molecular ligand coating (CL4) selectively target neurons rather than glia. We now provide an explanation for this
selective neuronal delivery. In this study, we compared three zwitterionic QD coatings differing only in their regions of
positive or negative charge, as well as a positively charged (NH2
) polyethylene glycol (PEG) coat, for their ability to deliver
the cell-membrane-penetrating chaperone lipopeptide JB577 (WG(Palmitoyl)VKIKKP9
G2
H6
) to individual cells in neonatal
rat hippocampal slices. We confirm both that preferential uptake in neurons, and the lack of uptake in glia, is strongly
associated with having a region of greater negative charge on the QD coating. In addition, the role of negatively charged
chondroitin sulfate of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in restricting uptake was further suggested by digesting neonatal rat
hippocampal slices with chondroitinase ABC and showing increased uptake of QDs by oligodendrocytes. Treatment still did
not affect uptake in astrocytes or microglia. Finally, the future potential of using QDs as vehicles for trafficking proteins into
cells continues to show promise, as we show that by administering a histidine-tagged green fluorescent protein (eGFP-His6
)
to hippocampal slices, we can observe neuronal uptake of GFP.

Introduction
Storage disorders can be treated by enzyme replacement
therapy unless they involve the central nervous system
(CNS; Hobert and Dawson, 2007; Jalanko and Braulke,
2009). For example, we are unable to treat late infantile
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL), a lysosomal
storage disorder in which a mutation in CLN2 (11p15)
causes neurons to fail to produce enzymatically viable
tripeptidylpeptidase 1 (TPP1) and store the subunit c of
mitochondrial ATP synthase. This is due in part to the
difficulty in trafficking proteins across the blood­brain
barrier as well as failure to target specific cell types,
such as neurons. Delivering bioactive peptides to subcel-
lular compartments and cytosol of specific cell types of
the CNS and to visually track that delivery and subse-
quent fate of the cargo is our goal, and we previously
reported the use of quantum dots (QDs) to deliver pep-
tides to neurons in rat hippocampal slices (Walters et al.,
2012). The commonly used approach of fluorophore
attachment to a peptide of interest must preserve reliable

fluorescence through tissue application, fixation, and
viewing, which can lead to photobleaching and subse-
quent loss of signal (Algar et al., 2011); use of QDs can
overcome many of these problems (Delehanty et al., 2010;
Boeneman et al., 2013). Peptides alone, with or without
targeting signals conjugated to them, will rarely pass the
blood­brain barrier, and not in any concentration that
would be efficacious (Carman et al., 2011). The use of
semiconductor QDs provides a potential vehicle for deliv-
ery, bioactivity testing, and visualization of attached
cargos due to their robust fluorescence, resistance to
photobleaching, and ease of peptide attachment via uti-
lizing a simple polyhistidine-Zn interaction (Medintz
et al., 2005). Native QDs such as those synthesized with
a CdSe/ZnS core/shell structure need to be surface func-
tionalized to make them colloidally stable and reduce
toxicity (Susumu et al., 2007, 2011); this also allows
researchers to append peptides to the QD surface to
assist in trafficking or peptide ligation. In this study, we
have used several modified compact ligand (CL) coatings
(Figure 1) that show greater cell-type specificity of uptake
than those displaying neutral or unmodified polyethylene
glycol (PEG). We have previously shown that zinc on the
surface of the QD can bind histidine-tagged peptides and
proteins such as maltose-binding protein (Boeneman
et al., 2013), and that by using the QD as a delivery
vehicle, we can attach signaling peptides to the surface
to further specify the target location. We previously
showed that a QD with a negative coat (CL4) facilitated
the delivery of a cargo (Palm-1/JB577) to neurons rather
than astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or microglia (Walters
et al., 2012) and now report that the surface charge is
critical for this cell-specific uptake.
In the current study, we expand our QD investigation
to include three different CL coats with modified struc-
tures and resultant regions of charge and found that the
coats varied dramatically in their targeting behavior. In
addition, we utilize a positively charged PEG coating and
show uptake in oligodendrocytes. Finally, we modified
the charge of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of two
in vitro systems and found that this can also contribute
to QD targeting (Soleman et al., 2013). These results con-
firm that both the charge of the QD, as well as the charge
of the target cell, strongly influences the trafficking and
fate of the QD in the CNS and by inference the intercel-
lular trafficking of proteins.
Materials and Methods
Quantum Dots
CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs with an emission maxima cen-
tered at $625 nm were made hydrophilic by exchanging
the native hydrophobic ligands with dihydrolipoic acid
(DHLA)-based CLs shown in Figure 1, see also
Susumu et al. (2011). In addition, a positively charged
DHLA-PEG-amine (DHLA-PEG600-NH2
) ligand was
also used. This displayed a terminal amine group instead
of the neutral methoxy group used in our first study
(Walters et al., 2012).
Peptides
The palmitoylated peptide (JB577) sequence used was
AcWG(Pal)DapVKIKKP9
GGH6
, where Pal corresponds
to a C16:0 palmitate group that is covalently attached to
a nonhydrolysable thiol-resembling diaminopropionic
acid residue (Dap) functionality synthesized into the pep-
tide backbone (Sapsford et al., 2007). All peptides were
synthesized using Boc (t-butoxycarbonyl)-solid phase
peptide synthesis, purified by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), and purity verified by electro-
spray ionization-MS (ESI-MS; Dawson et al., 2010). All
peptide sequences are written in the conventional N- to
C-terminal orientation. The peptides were purified,
desalted, and quantitated before being lyophilized and
stored at À20C until used as described (Sapsford et al.,
2009).
Microscopy and Image Analysis
The intracellular distribution of QDs was analyzed by
fluorescence microscopy using a Marianas fully auto-
mated Yokogawa-type spinning disc confocal microscope
equipped with 40 Â and 100 Â oil-immersion lenses.
Quantification of fluorescence via pixel intensity was
measured through ImageJ and graphically represented
through Microsoft Excel. A Student's independent t test
was performed on all quantification with a significance of
p .005.
Peptide-Mediated QD Delivery
QD­JB577 bioconjugates were formed by diluting a stock
solution of JB577 with QD at room temperature (1 mM
QD assembled with 1, 10, or 100 JB577 peptides per QD
in 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 8.9). After 15 min of conjuga-
tion, the conjugate was administered into a complete
growth medium overnight to a final QD concentration
of 50 to 100 nM. These peptide:QD ratios were deter-
mined experimentally for the peptide to be the ratio
that yielded the optimal degree of uptake without over-
expression, and 1:25 QD:peptide is used for these experi-
ments unless otherwise noted.
Uptake by Rat Hippocampal Slice Cultures
Hippocampal cultures were prepared as described previ-
ously (Kunkler and Kraig, 1997; Mitchell et al., 2010;
Walters et al., 2012). All procedures involving animals
2 ASN Neuro
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of Chicago and conducted
in accordance with the guidelines of the National
Institutes of Health. Briefly, Wistar rat pups (P9­P10,
where P is postnatal day) were anesthetized with a pro-
gressive exposure to 100% CO2
and decapitated, the
brains removed and placed into Hanks balanced salt
solution (HBSS; 3C) supplemented with D-glucose
(6.5 mg/ml). Hippocampi were then isolated and sec-
tioned (350-mm thick) perpendicular to their septotem-
poral axis. Slices displaying an intact pyramidal neuron
cell layer and dentate gyrus were transferred to uncoated
30-mm Millicell-CMTM tissue culture inserts (Millipore,
EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in six-well culture
dishes. Cultures were initially maintained in medium con-
taining 23% horse serum (no. 26050­088; Invitrogen,
Div. of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY,
USA) for 18 days in vitro before being transferred
to serum-free media for an additional 3 days in vitro
before experimentation (Mitchell et al., 2010). Slice
cultures were used between 21 and 35 days in vitro. The
constituents of horse-serum-based and serum-free media
are defined elsewhere (Mitchell et al., 2010).
Hippocampal brain slice cultures mature in vitro and
closely resemble the anatomical and physiological char-
acteristics of their in vivo counterparts (e.g., see Kunkler
and Kraig, 1997, 1998, 2004; Hulse et al., 2004; Kunkler
et al., 2005; Grinberg et al., 2011, 2012; Pusic et al., 2011;
Walters et al., 2012).
Uptake by Cultured Oligodendrocytes and
Astrocytes
Neonatal rat oligodendrocytes were isolated from cere-
bral hemispheres by the Bottenstein modification of the
method of McCarthy and de Vellis (1980) (Qi and
Dawson, 1993). Briefly, rat oligodendrocytes and astro-
cytes will be separated from the rest of the brain and
grown upon a polylysine-coated plate. The astrocytes
will form a bed layer upon the flask, while the oligo-
dendrocytes and remnant microglia will attach to that.
The oligodendrocytes can then be separated from the
astrocytes by a series of shakes. The first shake is carried
out at 7 days and subsequently at 1-week intervals with
shakes 2, 3, and 4 giving the highest yield of 98% pure
astrocytes and microglia-free neonatal rat oligodendro-
cytes. All cultures were differentiated for 6 days prior to
use. Finally, astrocytes are isolated from the flask

Antibodies and Staining
Hippocampal slices were fixed to gel-coated slides using
Prolong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen, no. P36931) contain-
ing 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), a nuclear stain
that binds strongly to A­T-rich regions in DNA.
Neuronal staining was carried out through Nissl staining
with NeuroTrace 500/525 green (Invitrogen, no.
N21480), which binds to negatively charged nucleic
acids in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of neurons
(Quinn et al., 1995). For oligodendrocytes, we used a
mouse monoclonal antibody to myelin basic protein
(MAB1580, Millipore), which has been shown to specif-
ically stain both early and mature oligodendrocytes and
myelin (Friedman et al., 1989). Staining for astrocytes is
achieved with an antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP; Sigma; Aldrich Co. St. Louis, MO, USA, no:
G3893), which is largely expressed in astrocytes, and
shown to be a robust method of detection (Courel
et al., 1986). Microglia were stained using isolectin b4
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, no. I21411),
isolated from the African legume Griffonia simplicifolia
and shown to be a robust stain for microglia (Streit,
1990). To detect digested chondroitin sulfate (CS) stubs,
we used monoclonal antibody MAB2030 from Millipore
Inc.
Results
The CLs used here are based off of the DHLA moiety
necessary to attach this coating to the QDs and colloid-
ally stabilize them (Algar et al., 2011; Susumu et al.,
2011). Although designed to be similarly zwitterionic,
they differ in the specific regions and combinations of
charges included in each and how they are structurally

organized as shown in Figure 1. All three were designed
to be a more compact version of DHLA-PEG ligands
previously used for coating QDs (Susumu et al., 2007).
We have previously shown that neutral PEG-methoxy
capped QDs do not give appreciable neuronal uptake,
while CL4-displaying QDs show robust neuronal target-
ing (Walters et al., 2012). We wished to extend our pre-
vious study to include similar QDs to investigate whether
charge is mediating neuronal targeting. CL1 contains a
piperidine ring and only one carboxyl group, giving a
region of stronger positive charge than the single nitrogen
found in CL4 and CL2. CL2 could be considered neutral
by virtue of the tertiary amine and the single carboxyl
group, whereas CL4 has a more negatively charged
region by virtue of its two carboxyl groups. We show
that replacement of one carboxyl group in CL4 still
allowed neuronal-specific uptake in rat hippocampal cul-
tures (Figure 2(b) and (c)), while removing a carboxyl
group and adding a piperazine ring (CL1) leads to mark-
edly less neuronal specificity (while still maintaining some
targeting), approximating what was seen with PEG
(Figure 3(a)) with respect to diffuse extracellular labeling
instead of strong intracellular puncta. Finally, we include
a positively charged PEG QD (DHLA-PEG600-NH2
),
which exhibits similar distribution to CL1 as well as
being the only QD we have tested that traffics to oligo-
dendrocytes without treatment (Figure 3).
To determine whether the behavior of the different
coats was dependent upon the milieu charge of the neur-
onal cultures more than the charge of the coat peptides
themselves, we attempted to remove negatively charged
proteoglycans (Maroto et al., 2013), expressed more
heavily by glial than neuronal cells (Schwartz and
Domowicz, 2014), by treating rat hippocampal slices
with chondroitinase ABC. The digestion with chondroi-
tinase ABC cleaves disaccharide units, leaving an oligo-
saccharide stub on the proteoglycan core protein that is
recognized by a specific antibody MAB2030. This CS
monoclonal antibody only reacts with digested cartilage
proteoglycans, not with native proteoglycans (Takeuchi
et al., 2013). Chondroitinase digestion has been shown to
be somewhat efficacious in digesting glial scarring in
models of spinal cord injury (Takeuchi et al., 2013).
Successful digestion (Figure 4) resulted in a marked

increase in oligodendrocyte uptake of CL4 QDs (Figure
5(a)) that previously had not been observed, but did not
improve uptake by astrocytes or microglia.
We then used primary cultures of rat oligodendro-
cytes, astrocytes, and microglia to further determine the
extent of chondroitinase ABC treatment on the uptake of
CL4 QDs in individual cell types. Overnight treatment
of oligodendrocyte cultures resulted in increased uptake
of CL4 QDs (Figure 5(b)) similar to what we observed in
hippocampal slices. Treatment of astrocyte or microglia
cultures, however, did not lead to a significant increase in
uptake (Figure 6). Therefore, there appears to be a spe-
cific interaction between the QD coat charge and the
charge of the extracellular milieu of the target cell,
which is enabling the neuronal specificity shown by
CL4 or CL2 QDs.
Finally, to continue to the end goal of using these QDs
as vehicles for protein delivery, we show that large pro-
teins can be taken up by neurons following attachment to
CL4 QDs. We conjugated a green fluorescent protein
(eGFP; 32.7 kDa) with a histidine tag (His6
) to CL4
QDs and show that this construct readily traffics into
neurons (Figure 7). GFP-His6
CL4 QDs were applied
for 24 hr and show similar distribution in the CA3
region of rat hippocampus as previously described for
CL4 QDs conjugated to cell-penetrating peptide JB577
(Walters et al., 2012). In contrast, GFP-His6
alone
showed very little uptake in the same slices when applied
for the same time period showing that CL4 QDs can be
used to traffic larger peptides and proteins ($33 kDa),
such as GFP, in addition to much smaller chaperone pep-
tides such as JB577.
Discussion
We report several findings indicating that charge plays an
important role in targeting QDs to cells of the CNS.
First, we show that altering the charge of the QD coating
through the selective replacement of hydroxyl groups, as
found on commercially available PEG QDs, with com-
pact ligands containing negatively charged carboxyls to
generate novel zwitterionic particles, significantly

increases the neuronal uptake and trafficking of these
dots with little to no uptake by glia. Second, to confirm
the idea that charge was critical to trafficking, we show
that degrading the ECM with chondroitinase ABC (an
enzyme that digests negatively charged CS, a major com-
ponent of the glial ECM) increased trafficking and uptake
of QDs into oligodendrocytes but had no effect on astro-
cytes or microglia. The role of cell surface charge in cell
uptake (endocytosis) has not been previously studied and
represents a new concept in facilitating translational
efforts in the CNS such as enzyme replacement therapy.
Finally, we show that the CL4 QDs can be used to traffic
proteins, in this case GFP, into the cell bodies of neurons
in culture. These novel results suggest a method for dir-
ecting the targeting and fate of clinically relevant cargo in
the brain through the manipulation of both the vehicle's
charge as well as the charge of the target location.
Previously, we have investigated the trafficking of
the novel cell-penetrating peptide WG(Pal)DapVKI
KKP9
G2
H6
(Palm-1/JB577) conjugated to CL4 QD.
QDs were chosen instead of a traditional tag due to
their robust and stable fluorescence, in addition to afford-
ing stable attachment of the His6-terminated peptide to
the zinc surface of the CdSe/ZnS QD. A spacer domain
(Proline9
-Glycine2
) separates the peptide from the tag,
allowing flexibility and integrity of the domains. The N-
terminal tryptophan permits 280 nm absorption monitor-
ing. The lipopeptide is a nonhydrolysable analog of the
palmitoylated K-Ras4A (CVKIKK) structure in which
the thiol group of cysteine was replaced by a diaminopro-
panol (Dap) and the remaining sequence (VKIKK) func-
tions as a chaperone and a cell-penetrating peptide
(Dawson et al., 2010; Delehanty et al., 2010).
We demonstrated that such a lipopeptide complex can
be taken up into cells by endocytosis and released from
the endosome over a 72-hr period (Boeneman et al.,
2013). This was demonstrated in cultured cell lines by
using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
analysis, which showed that the peptide initially stays
associated with the QDs for at least 72 hr (Delehanty
et al., 2010). Commercially available QDs are typically
coated with an amphiphilic copolymer that may have
additional PEG groups displayed on it to decrease tox-
icity as well as increase nanoparticle stability (Algar et al.,
2011; Bradburne, et al., 2013). When we used our CL4
QDs instead of PEG with the JB577 peptide, we found
that the QD preferentially trafficked to neurons in both
rat hippocampal cultures as well as human fibroblasts
(Walters et al., 2012). We observed no uptake by astro-
cytes and oligodendrocytes and only minimal uptake by

microglia, indicating that the chemical nature of the
DHLA coating may be providing neuronal specificity.
In addition, we showed in hippocampal slices that there
was no toxicity associated with the CdSe/ZnS QD and its
cargo (negative Sytox staining and intact mitochondria;
Walters et al., 2012). Santra et al. (2005) suggested that
TAT-conjugated QDs, intra-arterially delivered to a rat
brain labeled all brain tissue, whereas QDs without TAT
did not label brain tissue, validating the idea of using a
cell-penetrating peptide such as JB577 to cross the BBB.
By using in vivo chick administration (Agarwal et al.,
2015), we showed that QDs could travel from embryonic
spinal cord to cell body regions of the cortex, further
suggesting that JB577 may be able to facilitate transport
across the blood­brain barrier.
In the current study, we continue to build upon the
hypothesis that the CL4 coat is clearly mediating neur-
onal targeting of the CdSe/ZnS QDs. CL4 is a dipolar
molecule, containing two negatively charged carboxyl
groups on one end. We now report that when the QD
core is coated with a DHLA-based ligand containing at
least one carboxyl group as well as a tertiary amine (as in
CL2), the QD can be delivered to neurons in rat hippo-
campal slices as efficiently as with CL4. However, a coat
containing only one carboxyl group and a piperazine ring
(CL1) leads to noticeably reduced neuronal specificity
and a mostly extracellular distribution as we reported
previously for PEG (Figure 2). Interestingly, positively
charged PEG shows similar distribution as CL1 in CA3
region of the hippocampus but strikingly shows uptake in
oligodendrocytes as well (Figure 3). These data indicate
that charge is playing a role in the targeting of QDs into
neuronal cell bodies. Such phenomena would require that
charge surrounding the cells should also play a role, so we
decided to investigate whether digesting negatively
charged extracellular polymers such as CSs could
modify the trafficking of QDs.
Extracellular factors have been shown to affect axonal
regeneration, which is essential for recovery from spinal
cord injury (Filous et al., 2010; Mountney et al., 2013;
Takeuchi et al., 2013). CSs are produced mainly by astro-
cytes and oligodendrocytes in which uronic acid, plus
extensive sulfation, results in a negatively charged glyco-
calyx (Schwartz and Domowicz, 2014). Bacterially
derived enzymatic digestion of this matrix with chondroi-
tinase ABC has been shown to increase axonal regener-
ation following injury and upregulation of glial-derived
chondroitin sulfates proteoglycans (CSPGs) that create a

barrier to axonal regrowth. A recent report (Lang et al.,
2015) suggests that using a membrane-permeable peptide
can block this CSPG-mediated inhibition of recovery.
Similar results have been obtained by deleting N-acetyl-
galactosyltransferase-1 in transgenic mice (Takeuchi
et al., 2013). Such a treatment or deletion does not
affect heparan sulfate synthesis (in fact, it has been
shown to increase it), and this proteoglycan is typically
found on the surface of neurons, being important for
activation of many growth factor receptors. Because
endosomal uptake of CL4-QDs was observed in hippo-
campal neurons but not in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes,
and microglia present in the same hippocampal slice, we
tested the hypothesis that glial-derived, negatively
charged ECM molecules such as CSs could be preventing
endocytosis of QDs into nonneuronal cell types.
Chondroitinase ABC cleaves a particularly broad
range of galactosaminoglycan (GalAG) substrates,
including CS, dermatin sulfate (DS) and, to a much
lesser extent, hyaluronic acid. Neuronal galactosamino-
glycans are composed of disaccharide repeat units of
uronic acid [IduA (a-L-iduronic acid) or GlcA (b-D-glu-
curonic acid)] (1!3) linked to GalNAc (N-acetyl-D-
galactosamine). These basic disaccharide units are lin-
early associated via b-(1!4) linkages to form mostly
polymers of CS attached at multiple points along a core
protein. Biosynthesis of CS involves sulfation of the sugar
backbone at various positions, which generates diversity
in their oligosaccharide sequences. CS is commonly O-
sulfated at the C-4 of the N-acetylgalactosamine [C4S
(chondroitin-4-sulfate) or CSA], the C-6 of the N-acetyl-
galactosamine [C6S (chondroitin-6-sulfate) or CSC], or
iduronic acid and C4 of GalNAc (CSB; Schwartz and
Domowicz, 2014). Other rare modifications in CS, such
as 2-O-or 3-O-sulfation of the GlcA moieties, have also
been reported (Prabhakar et al., 2005). Treatment with
chondroitinase ABC has been shown to cause changes in
the ECM through digestion of CS and, to a much lesser

CL4 dots were applied for 24 hr and show similar distribution in CA3 region of hippocampus as previously described
for JB577-CL4 QDs (Walters et al., 2012). (b) GFP-His6

extent, hyaluronan (Galtrey et al., 2007). Chondroitinase
ABC digests CS-GAG chains into soluble sulfated disac-
charides by beta-elimination, leaving the core protein
intact (detectable by antibodies such as BE-123 to the
chondroitin-4-sulfate stub). This prevents the CSPG-
matrix glycoprotein interactions, which inhibit axonal
regeneration (Hill et al., 2012; Lang et al., 2015). Our
approach is further supported by the observation that
scar formation following injury to the CNS is strongly
associated with negatively charged CSs of the ECM, and
treatment with chondroitinase ABC has been shown to
reduce the thickness of the glial zone surrounding a cere-
bral artery (Hill et al., 2012). Therefore, we attempted to
reduce the amount of negative charge in the ECM sur-
rounding other cell types present in hippocampal slices
through digestion of CS by chondroitinase ABC in an
effort to increase uptake of CL4 QDs in these cell types.
Treatment with chondroitinase ABC for 6 hr and
longer showed increased CL4 QD uptake in oligodendro-
cytes, both in hippocampal slice cultures and oligo-
dendrocyte monocultures. This suggests that negative
charge is a contributing factor to neuronal targeting of
CL4 QDs. This argument is in agreement with our CL2
data showing similar neuronal specificity with slightly
reduced uptake, and with our CL1 coat data, which
shows a decrease in neuronal specificity with the removal
of one of the carboxyl groups and the addition of a
piperazine with two positive charges. This indicates that
the areas of negative charge on the CL4 or CL2 coat
convey neuronal specificity in a way that is not possible
with a more positively charged coat like CL1. Together,
these data show that at least one negatively charged carb-
oxyl on the QD coat (CL2/4) is sufficient to target the QD
to the neuronal cell body with little to no uptake in other
cell types. By changing the charge of the coat protein
from negative to positive (dipolar), however, the QD
exhibits a distribution similar to what we observed
using PEG QDs. Furthermore, by removal of negatively
charged proteoglycans in cell culture, it is possible to
increase CL4 trafficking to oligodendrocytes in both hip-
pocampal and monoculture systems, suggesting that
neuronal targeting is significantly influenced by charge.
We have previously only tested neutrally charged PEG
but not positively charged nanoparticles (Walters et al.,
2012). In this study, we include a positively charged vari-
ant (DHLA-PEG600-NH2
) and show that it behaves as
one would predict from our previous data with the add-
ition that it appears to traffic nicely into oligodendrocytes
in culture, something we have yet to see with the other
QDs without chondroitinase treatment. Other investiga-
tors have used positively charged nanoparticles such as
dimercaptosuccinate-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (D-
IONPs) containing the fluorescent dye BODIPY (BP) in
their coat (BP-D-IONPs). These have an overall positive
charge and were shown to be preferentially taken up by
oligodendroglial OLN-93 cells and not by neurons
(Adams et al., 2013). Fluorescent BP-D-IONPs and non-
fluorescent D-IONPs had similar hydrodynamic diam-
eters and showed identical colloidal stability in
physiological media with increasing particle size and posi-
tivation of the z-potential in presence of serum. Exposure
of oligodendroglial OLN-93 cells to BP-D-IONPs or D-
IONPs in the absence of serum increased the cellular iron
content to around 1800 nmol/mg. This was reduced to
around 50% at 4C and by around 90% by incubation
in presence of 10% serum. The accumulation of both D-
IONPs and BP-D-IONPs in the absence of serum was not
affected by an endocytosis inhibitor. However, in the
presence of serum, inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endo-
cytosis lowered the particle accumulation by around
50%. Colocalization studies with lysotracker revealed
that BP-D-IONP-containing vesicles were directed in
the cells to the lysosomal pathway (Luther et al., 2013).
The neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the
slices used in our study were cultured in a synthetic
serum-free medium, and cell cultures of differentiating
oligodendrocytes were maintained in serum-free
Bottensteins medium so the role of serum was not an
issue.
Adams et al. (2013) have also shown that positively
charged BP-D-IONP nanoparticles are taken up prefer-
entially by glia. They used mouse subventricular zone-
derived neural stem cells (maintained as neurospheres)
for magnetofection transfection of proteins at 24 hr
after plating. Transfection with Pmax-Green
Fluorescent Protein:magnetic nanoparticle complexes
(or pmaxGFP only for controls) was performed under
four magnetic field conditions (no field, static field and
oscillating fields (1 and 4 Hz)). Transfection efficiency was
enhanced over twofold by 4 Hz oscillating magnetic fields
and had no effect on cell viability, cell number, stem cell
marker expression, or the differentiation profiles of these
magnetofected cultures. However, only transfection of
these positively charged particles into glial cells was
observed, never neurons.
We therefore conclude that the surface charge on cells
is another critical determinant as to whether endocytosis
of QDs can take place, in addition to the charge of the
QD coat. Negatively dipolar CL4 or zwitterionic CL2 will
preferentially target neurons in culture, whereas neutral
PEG or positively dipolar CL1 shows a much more dis-
perse distribution. A positive QD has the inverse affect
and traffics to oligodendrocytes while showing similar
difficulty in associating with neurons.
A major problem in the treatment of neurodegenera-
tive diseases is the lack of noninvasive methods of traf-
ficking drugs to the brain. Nanoparticulate drug delivery
offers the possibility of overcoming this problem through
combination with a cell-penetrating peptide, better drug
targeting, reduced toxicity, and improved therapeutic

efficacy. The tight junctions of the blood­brain barrier
cause a much higher transendothelial electrical resistance
than those of other tissues, which makes intercellular
space tighter and less permeable for aqueous-based para-
cellular transport. However, the barrier also contains spe-
cific enzyme systems, transporters, and protein receptors,
which may turn out to be the key to bypassing it.
