Introduction
The propensity score analysis allows us to objectively
measure the probability of a patient being in a treatment
group or in another based on his/her baseline clinical and
demographic features, and thus to balance two non-equiv-
alent groups on observed potentially confounding varia-
bles, to get more accurate estimates of the effects of a
treatment on which the two groups differ.1­5 The propen-
sity score approach has been applied in many fields,
including cardiovascular research, and it is having an

Abstract
Introduction: This was a propensity score analysis of the prospective, randomized, double-blind Survival of Myocardial
Infarction Long-term Evaluation (SMILE) 4 study in which one-year treatment with zofenopril 60 mg plus acetylsalicylic
acid (ASA) 100 mg gave superior results compared to ramipril 10 mg plus ASA in terms of death or hospitalization for
cardiovascular causes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by left ventricular dysfunction (LVD).
Materials and methods: A total of 716 patients of the intention-to-treat population were divided into homogeneous
propensity quintiles (Q) using a logistic regression model (QI: best risk profile; QV: worst risk profile).
Results: Treatment was associated with a similar low rate of major cardiovascular events in any Q. However, the efficacy
of zofenopril was better than that of ramipril in QII, QV, and particularly QIII (odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
interval: 0.43 (0.21­0.87), p<0.05]. This result was primarily attributed to a decrease in the risk of cardiovascular
hospitalization, particularly striking in the QIII (OR: 0.40, 0.19-0.85; p<0.05). Mortality rate did not significantly differ
between the two treatments in any Q.
Conclusions: In the SMILE-4 study the propensity analysis confirmed the efficacy of zofenopril in the prevention of long-
term cardiovascular outcomes irrespective of the cardiovascular risk profile of post-AMI patients.

increasing role as a potentially useful method of data anal-
ysis to estimate treatment effects when potential bias may
be present.3
The prospective, double-blind, randomized Survival of
Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation (SMILE) 4
study showed the superiority of one-year treatment with
zofenopril 60 mg plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg
vs ramipril 10 mg plus ASA in the prevention of major
cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute myocar-
dial infarction (AMI) complicated by left ventricular dys-
function (LVD).6 In the present article we report on the
outcomes of the retrospective propensity score analysis of
the SMILE-4 data. This analysis was performed to further
investigate the cardiovascular risk reduction profile of
zofenopril in the clinical setting of the SMILE-4 study
and to increase the power of the study, by correcting for
some potential confounding factors, in an attempt to re-
evaluate the study results at the light of the primary impact
of the therapy rather than of factors related to the study
population.
Materials and methods
Study design
The full methodology of the SMILE-4 study has been
detailed elsewhere.6 In short, male and non-pregnant
female patients aged 18­85 years with a confirmed diag-
nosis of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the
24-hour period preceding enrolment (treated or not with
primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
(PTCA), treated or not with thrombolysis and recom-
mended pharmacologic treatment) and with clinical and/
or echocardiographic evidence of LVD were enrolled in
79 hospitals in eight different countries. The study was
conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Good
Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki and the
protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of the University of Bologna as well as by the local ethics
committees when required (see acknowledgments for a
list members of the SMILE-4 working party by country).
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient
before enrolment. The SMILE-4 study (protocol MEN/03/
ZOF-CHF/001) was registered with EudraCT Number
2004-001150-88 (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu) and with
the Italian Ministry of Health Code: GUIDOTT_
III_2004_001 (https://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it).
The first patient was enrolled in March 2005, and the
last patient completed in July 2009. Patients complying
with the study eligibility criteria entered a four-day open-
label phase, during which zofenopril was administered to
all patients according to an up-titration scheme.7 On days
1 and 2, patients received zofenopril 7.5 mg twice daily
plus an evening dose of ASA 100 mg. On days 3 and 4 the
zofenopril dose was doubled (15 mg twice daily), whereas
the dose of ASA was kept unchanged. On day 5 patients
were randomized 1:1 double-blind (using a centralized,
computer-generated randomization list) to receive zofeno-
pril 30 mg twice daily and ASA 100 mg once daily or
ramipril 5 mg twice daily and ASA 100 mg once daily for
12 months. The study medications were given in combi-
nation with standard recommended treatments for AMI.
Patients were seen at enrolment, at randomization and at
one, six and 12 months thereafter. A physical examina-
tion, a 12-lead electrocardiogram and laboratory tests
(haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis) were
performed at entry, at randomization and at the study end.
Laboratory tests included red blood cell count, white
blood cell count, platelet count, serum creatinine, blood
glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,
triglycerides, serum transaminases and urinalysis.
Glomerular filtration rate was estimated by the Cockroft-
Gault formula.8 Blood pressure and heart rate were meas-
ured, an echocardiogram was performed, blood samples
were drawn (centralized estimation of N-terminal pro
brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and occurrence of
concomitant diseases, adverse events, use of concomitant
medications and compliance to study drugs were checked
at each study visit.
Statistical analysis
In this post-hoc analysis of the SMILE-4 study we evaluated
the probability of receiving different treatments (based on
the measured characteristics) with the propensity score.2
The propensity score is usually estimated by applying a
logistic regression analysis, where the outcome is the treat-
ment variable and predictor variables are the covariates.3,4
Accordingly, we estimated propensity scores with the
observed covariates as predictors, and treatment assignment
(dummy coded 0=ramipril, 1=zofenopril) as dependent var-
iable. The selected model included 13 possible patient vari-
ables (predictors), as recorded at entry: age (>65 vs 65
years), gender, heart rate (>70 vs 70 bpm), diagnosis of
diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolaemia, low
HDL, type of infarction (STEMI vs NSTEMI), revasculari-
zation, Killip class (2 vs 1), NT-proBNP (330 vs <330
pg/ml), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (40 vs
>40%), GFR (<60 vs 60 ml/min). Such variables were
selected because they were considered representative of the
individual's risk level and were available as complete data
for all patients. After fitting the model according to a step-
wise approach, the patients in the two treatment groups were
stratified according to the aforementioned predictors and
ranked in five equal-sized strata or quintiles (Qs). The QI
represented patients with the best and the QV included those
with the worst risk profile; thus, patients inside each Q had
a similar overall risk. The choice of five strata was based on
Borghi et al. 3
the Cochran method,9 which showed that, in general, five
strata are able to remove approximately 90% of the bias due
to a single continuous covariate.10 To validate the propensity
score model we tested each of the covariates (predictors) in
a two-way (two conditions×five strata) analysis of variance,
examining the magnitude and significance of the F ratio for
the treatment group main effect and the interaction F ratio.
If both F ratios were small, balance on the covariate was
probably reasonable. However, if either F ratio was large,
the model was revised including any covariates with large F
ratios that had previously been excluded during the stepwise
procedure, and if balance was still questionable, nonlinear
and interaction terms were added. We used logistic regres-
sion in a similar two-step procedure for assessing the bal-
ance of dichotomous categorical variables. To estimate the
effects of treatment with a propensity score adjustment,
zofenopril and ramipril group means were analysed as the
unweighted average of the cell means over the five strata for
each group. The appropriateness of the propensity score
model was confirmed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness
of fit test (p=0.459).
The primary study end-point was defined as in the orig-
inal study as the one-year combined occurrence of cardio-
vascular mortality or hospitalization for cardiovascular
causes. Secondary study end-points, including hospitaliza-
tion and death for cardiovascular causes, were assessed as
well. Efficacy evaluation was carried out in the intention-
to-treat population, defined as patients treated with at least
one dose of study medication and documenting at least
once the measure of the primary efficacy assessment, even
in a case of protocol violation or premature withdrawal
from the study.
The difference between treatment groups with respect
to the primary combined end-point and cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality rate, was assessed within each Q
of the propensity score, by calculating the estimated odds
ratio and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. The
Chi-square analysis was applied to data with the Mantel-
Haenszel extension for the comparison between the two
treatment groups. A logistic regression model was also
applied to assess differences between treatments, by
accounting for treatment and propensity score group.
Survival curves were drawn using Kaplan-Meier estimates
and the survival analysis was performed according to sur-
vival Cox regression analysis.
All p values are two-tailed and the minimum level of
statistical significance was set at p value less than 0.05.
Results
Study population
The 716 patients of the original SMILE-4 study intention-
to-treat population were included in this analysis. For the
purpose of the current analysis, the patients were ranked
by their estimated propensity score and grouped in Qs. The
propensity score was similar for the two treatment groups
within each Q (Table 1). Stratifying on the Qs of the pro-
pensity score model resulted in residual imbalance between
individuals treated with zofenopril vs ramipril patients in
the upper (QV) and lower (QI) Qs. After the matching pro-
cess, the two treatment groups looked balanced for pro-
pensity scores (Figure 1).
A statistically significant difference was observed
across the five groups for the predictors included in the
propensity analysis (Table 1). It should be noted that, with
few exceptions, relevant concomitant cardiovascular treat-
ments were equally distributed among the five Qs, either at
baseline (Table 1) and at the study end (data not shown).
One-year combined end-point
In the whole study population, cardiovascular death or
hospitalization occurred in 105 of 365 patients in the
zofenopril group (29%) and in 128 of 351 patients in the
ramipril group (37%), with a 30% significantly (p=0.028)
lower risk of achieving the combined end-point with
zofenopril (odds ratio and 96% confidence interval: 0.70
(0.51­0.96)). A logistic regression analysis adjusted by the
propensity score confirmed the superiority of zofenopril,
with results completely overlapping those of the original
study (0.70 (0.51­0.96), p=0.028).
For the primary study end-point, the rate of major car-
diovascular events was similar across the various propen-
sity groups (QI: 34%; QII: 32%; QIII: 32%; QIV: 34%;
QV: 32%), but differences in the effect of the two study
drugs were observed within each Q of the propensity score
(Figure 2). In the QI and QIV the rates of the combined
end-point were similar between zofenopril and ramipril. In
the QII, QIII and QV, treatment with zofenopril was asso-
ciated with a lower rate of cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality than ramipril, the difference being statistically
significant for the QIII (0.43 (0.21­0.87), p<0.05).
A survival Cox regression analysis using treatment and
propensity score group as predicting variables indicated a
significantly overall larger survival rate under zofenopril
(0.77 (0.59­0.99), p=0.045) and no statistically significant
(p=0.995) effect of the propensity score in predicting the
probability of the outcome at a given time of the observa-
tion. The lack of difference in the trend of the overall treat-
ment effect within the Qs (Figure 3) was confirmed by the
fact that the cumulative survival curves were superimpos-
able across the five Qs, regardless of the type of treatment
(Figure 4).
One-year rate of hospitalization and death for
cardiovascular causes
In the main study the reduction in the risk of major cardio-
vascular events was mainly attributable to a decreased risk
4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (0.64 (0.46­
0.88), p=0.006). The same analysis modelled with the pro-
pensity score showed similar results (0.64 (0.46­0.90),
p=0.009). Hospitalization rates were always lower under
zofenopril in any Q, a between-treatment statistically sig-
nificant difference being observed for the QIII (0.40
(0.19­0.85); p<0.05) (Table 2).
Since few deaths occurred over the one-year observa-
tion period, mortality contribution to the primary study
endpoint was marginal and the rate of deaths for cardio-
vascular causes did not significantly differ between treat-
ments in the original study (1.51 (0.70­3.27), p=0.293).
This was the case also for the propensity analysis, though
a trend to a non-statistically significant larger reduction in
mortality with zofenopril was observed (0.66 (0.30­1.43),
p=0.291). No between-treatment differences in mortality
rates were ever observed in any Q of the propensity score
(Table 3).
Discussion
It is well established that angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors should be given to patients with an
impaired LVEF or those who have experienced heart fail-
ure in the early phase of an AMI. The protective effects of
ACE-inhibition have been demonstrated independent of

ACE-inhibitor, in combination with ASA, showed a
decreased one-year risk of major cardiovascular compli-
cations, the effect being larger than that of ramipril plus
ASA.6 Such superiority was mainly attributable to a larger
decrease in the rate of cardiovascular hospitalizations in
the zofenopril-treated patients, with no significant differ-
ences in cardiovascular mortality.
In this post-hoc analysis of the SMILE-4 study based on
propensity data modelling, we confirmed the results of the
main study, with the addition of new important findings.
The preliminary step of the propensity approach applied to
the SMILE-4 study was to verify the homogeneity between
the two patient groups: after the matching process, the
treatment groups were well balanced and, consequently,
comparable on propensity scores. The use of the propensity
score as a stratification method yielded new information on
how demographic and clinical variables may have influ-
enced the outcome of treatment. Although the rate of major
cardiovascular events was constant across the various pro-
pensity score groups (Qs), we observed some heterogeneity
in the treatment effects: indeed, zofenopril was associated
with a greater reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular
events (primary study endpoint) and hospitalizations alone
(secondary endpoints) in QII, QIII and QIV, with a stati-
cally significant difference in favour of this drug in the
third Q. Mortality rates were similarly affected by both
study treatments, irrespective of the propensity group, con-
firming the finding of the main study. Thus, the propensity
score analysis helped in substantiating the main study
results, because it allowed us to correct for some potential
confounding factors, mainly related to the study popula-
tion. We can speculate on the origin of the observed superi-
ority of zofenopril over ramipril in individuals at an
intermediate risk, but not in the other Qs. Likely, patients in
the low, and those in the high, risk category may equally
benefit from both ACE-inhibitors, with no specific

advantages of one treatment over the other. Particularly in
high risk patients, the class effect could be more important
than the specific properties of the pharmacological com-
pounds (in this case zofenopril and ramipril). We also
acknowledge that, given the small number of subjects in
each Q, the possibility that the between-group difference
might be a result of chance cannot be ruled out.
The propensity score analysis represents an alternative to
standard adjustment methods (linear or logistic regression)
and is a useful tool to provide estimates of the treatment
effects and create a direct covariate balance between com-
pared groups, thus removing bias.2,3 The propensity analysis
is a suitable technique especially for clinical settings where
other pretreatment observed covariates (e.g. disease risk
factors, concomitant treatments, demographic variables) are
present, and it is necessary to reach an unbiased effect
assessment of the randomly compared treatments. As well
as the estimating of causal effects of treatments coming
from large databases,16 the propensity score analysis can
yield clinically relevant information with practical implica-
tions. For instance, results from propensity analysis may
provide helpful hints for improving treatment efficacy.17,18
Matching subjects by propensity analysis may also help
refining the intervention strategies.19,20 Propensity analysis
may help unravelling prognostic factors negatively influ-
encing the drug treatment effect.21­24
In the context of our study, the result of the propensity
analysis may have practical clinical implications, because
it might help in identifying subjects who could benefit
most from treatment with one or the other ACE inhibitor
used in the study. It is likely that subjects at intermediate
risk might benefit more by early treatment with zofenopril,
whereas in other risk classes one or the other treatment
may be equally effective.
Study limitations
Our study should be interpreted in the context of some
potential limitations. First, though the propensity score of
the SMILE-4 study provided an adjustment for measured
differences between treatment groups, this analysis, by its
nature, did not include unmeasured differences. Despite the
methodological rigour due to the design of the SMILE-4
trial and the stratification of patients based on the propen-
sity score approach, possible unknown risk factors could
have contributed to the generation of cardiovascular out-
comes. Second, the propensity score retrospective analysis
was not included in the original SMILE-4 study protocol;
therefore, potentially significant information could have
not been collected at the enrolment phase and/or during the
study progress. Third, the relatively limited length of the
patient's follow-up may have reduced the chance of record-
ing some events and, in particular, may explain the low
mortality rate; due to this fact, the propensity analysis was
not helpful for better exploring the impact of treatments
and their possible diversity on cardiovascular deaths.
Fourth, usually the propensity analysis is appropriately
applied to observational studies in order to minimize the
limitations due to the non-randomized nature of the stud-
ies. In the case of our double-blind randomized study this
approach might appear to be less useful. However, we
think that it helped provide a confirmatory analysis of the
main study results
Conclusions
The propensity score analysis of the SMILE-4 study con-
firmed the good efficacy of zofenopril in the prevention of
one-year cardiovascular outcomes. The propensity model
was useful to confirm results of the main study by correct-
ing for selection bias and possible unbalance between
treatment groups, and to support the view that zofenopril is
beneficial regardless of an individual patient's cardiovas-
cular risk level.
