Abstract:
Labor market studies on the effects of minimum wages are typically confined
to the sector or worker group directly affected. We present a two-sector search
model in which one sector is more productive than the other one and thus,
pays higher wages. In such a framework, setting a minimum wage in the
unproductive sector to reduce the wage gap causes a negative spillover effect
on the productive sector. While the effect on job creation in the (targeted) un-
productive sector is ambiguous, job creation in the (non-targeted) productive
sector unambiguously decreases. This is driven by the fact that a minimum
wage increases the outside option of unemployed workers - contributing to
wage determination in the productive sector. Welfare effects are ambiguous.
In principle, we cannot exclude that a minimum wage in a two-sector search
model is welfare enhancing due to the possibility of an above optimal level
of productive employment since firms do not take into account the effects of
their individual job creation on aggregated search costs.
Keywords: minimum wages, matching models, two sectors, unemployment,
welfare.

Non-technical summary
The policy debate over the need for minimum wages has gained momentum in
Europe, especially in Germany, over the past two years. While opponents of a
minimum wage fear job losses, proponents assert that the impact of a minimum
wage on employment will be benign. It is well known from the theoretical
literature that the employment effects crucially depend on the labor market
structure. In a competitive labor market model, the real wage is equal to the
marginal productivity of labor, and the introduction of a minimum wage (above
the competitive market wage) will inevitably lead to reduced employment. On
the other end of the spectrum (monopsony model), if a single firm represents
the labor demand side in a certain segment and acts like a monopolist in the
product market, the firm maximizes its profits by choosing the lowest wage
possible in order to attract enough employees to keep production at its desired
level. Against this background, the introduction of a minimum wage will
entail an increase in employment as long as the minimum wage is less than
the competitive wage. Models of monopsonistic competition in labor markets
are located somewhere in the middle ground between perfectly competitive and
monopsonist models, assuming a certain degree of employer market power, and
open the door to positive, neutral or negative effects. While there is no clear
consensus in the empirical literature, the preponderance of evidence points to
disemployment effects.
The studies on minimum wages so far have largely focused on the group or
sector directly targeted. We depart from this pattern by investigating whether
minimum wages exert a negative spillover effect on other non-targeted sectors.
We present a labor market model in which, despite a homogenous pool of
workers, two sectors exist that differ in their productivity due to structural or
regional differences. The introduction of a minimum wage in the relatively un-
productive sector unambiguously reduces employment in the productive sector,
implying a negative spillover effect. On the other hand, the employment effect
in the unproductive sector is ambiguous. The minimum wage in the unproduc-
tive sector increases the outside option of workers in the unproductive sector.
An increasing outside option improves their bargaining position and ability
to demand higher wages in the productive sector (i.e. the reservation wage
increases), leaving firms less willing to hire. This effect increases the average
duration of jobs in the unproductive sector and the chance of unproductive
employees to find employment in the productive sector. If this effect is strong
enough, a minimum wage in the unproductive sector potentially increases em-
ployment in the unproductive sector and, depending on the parameters, in-
creases overall employment. It seems especially noteworthy that even if aggre-
gate employment rises, this comes at a cost to productive employment.
Prima facie, welfare seems to worsen unambiguously due to falling aggre-
gate production. But it is worth mentioning that the most common measure
for welfare in search models consists of aggregate production and aggregate
search costs. Such costs stem from the continuous creation of vacancies that
need to be filled. As a consequence, results regarding welfare effects are am-
biguous in this model. Any deviation from the optimal level of employment
in the canonical one-sector search model can lead to an increase in employ-
ment, which might be offset by higher search costs, leading to a decrease in
welfare. Search models typically yield suboptimal employment in equilibrium.
Job creation in the productive sector in competitive equilibrium of our two-
sector search model also tends to be too high from a welfare point of view as
individual firms in the productive sector do not take into account the effects
of their vacancy opening on social costs, i.e. rising aggregate search costs,
resulting in an inefficient market outcome.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Die wirtschaftspolitische Diskussion ¨
uber die Notwendigkeit eines Mindestlohns
hat in Europa, insbesondere in Deutschland, in den letzten zwei Jahren wieder
Fahrt aufgenommen. Die Ansichten der Bef¨
urworter und Gegner des Mindest-
lohns unterscheiden sich vor allem hinsichtlich der Besch¨
aftigungswirkungen.
W¨
ahrend in der theoretischen und empirischen Literatur kein eindeutiger Kon-
sensus herrscht, deuten die empirischen Studien doch mehrheitlich auf negative
Effekte eines Mindestlohnes hin.
Die bisherigen Analysen zum Mindestlohn konzentrieren sich gr¨
oßtenteils
auf die direkt betroffenen Gruppen oder Sektoren. Die vorliegende Arbeit
hingegen geht der Frage nach, ob Mindestl¨
ohne ¨
Ubertragungseffekte in an-
dere, nicht direkt betroffene Sektoren verursachen. Wir zeigen in einem theo-
retischen Modell gleichgewichtiger Arbeitslosigkeit, in dem es trotz homogener
Arbeitnehmerschaft aufgrund von strukturellen oder regionalen Differenzen
zwei unterschiedlich produktive Sektoren gibt, dass die Einf¨
uhrung eines Min-
destlohnes im relativ unproduktiven Sektor eindeutig die Besch¨
aftigung im rel-
ativ produktiven Sektor senkt und somit einen negativen ¨
Ubertrtagungseffekt
mit sich bringt. Die Besch¨
aftigungseffekte im unproduktiven Sektor sind
hingegen uneindeutig. Der Mindestlohn im unproduktiven Sektor senkt zwar
aufgrund h¨
oherer Lohnkosten zun¨
achst die Einstellungswahrscheinlichkeit im
unproduktiven Sektor, er erh¨
oht allerdings auch den Nutzenzuwachs, den
ein Arbeitnehmer erf¨
ahrt, wenn er im unproduktiven Sektor angestellt wird.
Wir zeigen, dass der Reservationsnutzen steigt. Dies erlaubt den Arbeit-
nehmern im produktiveren Sektor h¨
ohere L¨
ohne durchzusetzen und senkt
gleichzeitig die Bereitschaft zur Schaffung neuer Stellen und die Wahrschein-
lichkeit eines Arbeitnehmers, vom unproduktiven in den produktiven Sektor
zu wechseln. Letzterer Effekt f¨
uhrt zu einer l¨
angeren erwarteten Dauer eines
Besch¨
aftigungsverh¨
altnisses im unproduktiven Sektor, was den Anreiz steigert,
neue Stellen zu schaffen. Ist dieser Effekt stark genug, kann ein Mindest-
lohn im unproduktiven Sektor dort sogar die Besch¨
aftigung erh¨
ohen und es
ist, abh¨
angig von der Parametrisierung unseres Modells, prinzipiell nicht aus-
geschlossen, dass die aggregierte Besch¨
aftigung steigt. Allerdings wird dies
mit einer niedrigeren produktiven Besch¨
aftigung erkauft. Auf den ersten Blick
erscheint ein Mindestlohn somit eindeutig wohlfahrtssch¨
adigend zu sein, weil
er die aggregierte Produktion senkt.
Es ist allerdings hierbei zu beachten, dass sich das g¨
angigste Wohlfahrtsmaß
in Suchmodellen aus der aggregierten Produktion abz¨
uglich der aggregierten
Suchkosten ergibt. Dies bedeutet dann, dass Aussagen ¨
uber Wohlfahrtsef-
fekte in diesem Modellrahmen uneindeutig sind. In dem vorliegenden Zwei-
Sektoren-Suchmodell ist das Marktgleichgewicht durch ein zu hohes Niveau
an produktiver Besch¨
aftigung gekennzeichnet, da es wegen der h¨

duktivit¨

Sektor Stellen zu schaffen, diese individuelle Entscheidung aber die Wirkun-
gen auf die aggregierten Suchkosten, die ¨

Spillover Effects of Minimum Wages in a Two-
Sector Search Model1
1 Introduction
The public debate over minimum wages has gained momentum in Germany
over the past two years. While the business community is expressing unease
over the latest push for a minimum wage against the background of a slowing
world economy and fear of job losses, advocates of such a move claim that such
wages are necessary to create social justice, as large firms allegedly abuse their
power to push wages below a socially desired level.2 In their view, negative
employment effects are not to be expected. But this public discussion is not
confined to Germany. While the introduction of a (modest) minimum wage in
Great Britain in 1999 has been largely perceived as successful, the relatively
high level of minimum wages in France is often held responsible for the high
unemployment rate of young and low-skilled employees. From the literature, it
is well known that the employment effects of minimum wages crucially depend
on the labor market structure. While most studies on minimum wages are
usually confined to the sector directly affected, this paper presents a two-
sector economy in which only one sector is directly affected by minimum wages
and analyzes the resulting spillovers as well as the effects on unemployment,
employment structure and welfare.
The effects of minimum wages on employment have been studied in a va-
riety of different theoretical frameworks. In the "textbook" competitive labor
market model, the real wage is equal to the marginal productivity of labor. If
a minimum wage above the competitive market wage is introduced, this will
inevitably lead to reduced employment. At the other end of the spectrum,

2Recent newspaper articles on the discussion on minimum wage in Germany include for
instance FT (2008), Spiegel Online (2008) and Economist (2006). Many leading German
economists offer their view on minimum wages in Ifo (2008). For an influential, controversial

monopsony models open the door to the possibility that (moderate) minimum
wage increases can lead to employment growth, depending on the elasticity of
labor supply. Those models go back to Stigler (1946). A monopsonist firm
is assumed to be the only firm in a certain segment of the labor market that
demands labor, giving the employer absolute market power. Hence, much like
a monopolist in the product market, the monopsonist firm maximizes its prof-
its by choosing the lowest wage possible in order to attract enough employees
to keep production at its desired level. Hence, a monopsony remunerates the
marginal employee with (potentially) less than its marginal productivity of la-
bor. Against this background, the introduction of a minimum wage will entail
an increase in employment as long as the minimum wage is less than the com-
petitive wage. This strand of literature is surveyed by Bhaskar et al. (2002),
Cahuc and Zylberberg (2004, ch. 12), Manning (2003, ch. 12) and Boal and
Ransom (1997). Models of oligopsony and monopsonistic competition in la-
bor markets are located somewhere in the middle ground between perfectly
competitive and monopsonist models,3 which might indeed be an accurate
description of the labor market. These models assume a certain degree of em-
ployer market power, yet ­ at the same time ­ employers are competing for
workers, which implies that firms face a less than perfectly elastic supply curve.
If a minimum wage is introduced, two distinct channels can be expected. On
the one hand, a moderate minimum wage can increase employment at the firm
level through greater labor market participation. On the other hand, a binding
minimum wage will eat into firms' profits and cause some firms to exit the mar-
ket. The overall employment effect depends on which effect dominates. While,
for instance, Bhaskar and To (1999) report ambiguous results when firms exit,
Walsh (2003) and Bhaskar and To (2001) find an unambiguously positive and
negative employment effect, respectively. Last, but not least, search frictions
in labor market search models can, to a certain extent, also be interpreted as a
source of monopsony power (for early accounts, see for instance Albrecht and
Axell, 1984, and Burdett and Mortensen, 1998). Many of the theoretical re-
sults on employment and welfare presented so far crucially hinge on the exact
nature of the search friction and on the bargaining power of workers. Ulti-
mately, this is an empirical question. Two influential surveys on the empirical
literature on minimum wages are Card and Krueger (1995) and Neumark and

al. (2002).

Wascher (2007). While the first study underlines the possibility that minimum
wage effects on employment can be neutral or benign, the later concludes that
"the preponderance of the evidence points to disemployment effects." Addison
et al. (2009) find a modest positive employment effect once they allow for
geographic-specific trends. The recent study by Flinn (2006) constitutes one
of the few ambitious attempts to come up with empirical welfare effects of
minimum wages.
In this paper, employment and welfare effects in a two-sector search econ-
omy are analyzed from a theoretical perspective. We extend the matching
framework of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994, 1999, 2003) and Pissarides
(2000) by introducing an additional sector. While both sectors revert to the
same pool of homogenous workers, we assume differences in the sector produc-
tivity and label one sector productive and the other one unproductive. Such
productivity differences can be motivated by economies with sectoral or re-
gional differences, where the same type of worker can be employed in either
sector (agricultural vs. industrial; exporting vs. non-exporting or urban vs.
rural sector). Fuchs-Sch¨
undeln and Izem (2007) corroborate this assumption
by showing that East and West German workers exhibit very similar skills af-
ter German reunification. They conclude that regional productivity differences
between East and West Germany are largely driven by job characteristics. To-
daro (1969) makes a similar argument for developing countries. Owing to
search frictions, both sectors simultaneously exist. In the competitive equilib-
rium, wages in the productive sector are higher than those in the unproductive
sector, as in Acemoglu (2001). Hence, workers who have the chance will change
jobs from the unproductive to the productive sector.4 We assume that the gov-
ernment will decide to introduce a minimum wage in the unproductive sector,
which is, in principle, binding for the unproductive sector and equal to or
smaller than the competitive wage negotiated in the productive sector.
Our first main result is that the minimum wage only unambiguously re-
duces job creation and employment in the productive sector, whereas its em-
ployment effect on the unproductive sector is ambiguous. This result stems
4We do not mean to say that the unproductive sector is truly unproductive, but simply
less productive (in relative terms). Following Acemoglu (2001), we could also use the phrases
"good" and "bad" jobs. Another rationale for such a dual labor market structure is given
by Jones (1987), who applies a shirking framework and also introduces minimum wages in
the less productive sector. Whereas he finds a positive spillover to the productive sector, we
will see that our model generates a negative spillover.
3
from the fact that a minimum wage in the unproductive sector ceteris paribus
increases the unemployed workers' outside option, as any employment in the
unproductive sector now yields a higher wage. An increasing outside option
improves their bargaining position and ability to demand higher wages in the
productive sector (i.e. the reservation wage increases), leaving firms less willing
to hire. However, if productive job creation falls, the chances of unproductive
employees to find employment in the productive sector will fall as well, and the
average duration of jobs in the unproductive sector will increase. On the one
hand, this may trigger more job creation, on the other, higher wage costs de-
crease the incentive for job creation in the unproductive sector. Ultimately, the
employment effect in the unproductive sector depends on which of these effects
dominates. What are the consequences of a minimum-wage-induced increase
in the outside option for the productive sector? We find that even a decrease
in job creation in the unproductive sector is not able to compensate for higher
earnings when finding a job in the unproductive sector. Consequently, wage
costs always increase and job creation unambiguously falls in the productive
sector. What are the overall effects on employment? While economy-wide
unemployment increases whenever job creation in the unproductive sector de-
creases, the effects on unemployment are ambiguous whenever job creation
in the unproductive sector increases (due to more inflows from the productive
sector and more outflows to the unproductive sector). This implies that a min-
imum wage targeting the unproductive sector in a two-sector search economy
harms productive employment while its effects on unproductive employment
are ambiguous. It seems especially noteworthy that even if aggregated employ-
ment rises, this is, in our model, at the cost of lower productive employment.
At first sight, this seems to worsen welfare. To analyze this issue, we fol-
low Pissarides (2000) by taking aggregated production minus search costs as
a welfare measure in order to investigate this conjecture. Our welfare measure
for the two-sector search model is in the spirit of the well-known Hosios condi-
tion (Hosios, 1990), which states that social optimum is reached whenever the
bargaining power of workers equals the matching elasticity. Given the labor
market structure and search frictions in our model, job creation in the produc-
tive sector in a competitive equilibrium tends to be too high from a welfare
point of view as individual firms in the productive sector do not take into ac-
count the effects of their vacancy posting on social costs, i.e. rising aggregate
search costs. This even holds when the bargaining power of workers equals
4
the matching elasticity. Hence, the imposition of higher wage costs in the pro-
ductive sector (via the introduction of a minimum wage in the unproductive
sector) may improve welfare as aggregate search costs fall due to a lower job
creation rate in the productive sector. Still, a minimum wage by itself will not
be able to generate a first-best outcome, since it can only insure ceteris paribus
optimal job creation either in the productive or unproductive sector. In the
equilibrium with a minimum wage, there will be ­ compared to the Hosios
conditions applicable in our framework ­ still too (little) much job creation
in the (un)productive sector because of suboptimal (superoptimal) wage costs
in the (un)productive sector whenever the minimum wage is chosen according
to the optimality condition in the unproductive (productive) sector because
of the spillover effects. Hence, in such a model with search frictions and the
existence of a minimum wage, the first-best outcome can only be reached by
either additionally subsidizing unproductive labor or taxing productive work,
depending on whether the minimum wage is chosen such as it yields optimal
job creation in the productive or unproductive sector ceteris paribus.
The contribution of our paper is twofold. First, we are to the best of
our knowledge the first to document a minimum-wage-induced spillover effect
in a matching framework. We show that minimum wages may have nega-
tive employment repercussions on sectors that are not targeted by minimum
wages. Three other recent studies also stress the importance of spillover ef-
fects. Lechthaler and Snower (2008) show that minimum wages may discourage
firms from adequately training low-skilled workers, potentially resulting in a
"low-skill trap". Dolado et al. (2007) argue that positive spillover effects of
targeted employment protection legislation reforms on non-targeted workers
may be economically relevant. Finally, Falk et al. (2006) find evidence in
favor of a wage spillover effect due to the introduction of a minimum wage.
Second, we propose an alternative setup to augment the conventional matching
framework by an additional sector, which might prove useful for other research
questions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the
basic model. Section 3 pictures the competitive equilibrium, whereas section
4 describes the equilibrium with minimum wages. In section 5, we analyze
the effects of minimum wages on job creation and employment, while section 6
conducts a welfare assessment. Section 7 concludes. A mathematical appendix
is added.

2 The Basic Setup
Our model is an extension of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994, 1999, 2003) in
continuous time. We assume that workers are risk neutral, live infinitely, and
discount the future at rate r. Worker population is normalized to one. Labor
market frictions are captured by a matching function, assuming that a match
between an unemployed worker and a vacancy is only realized if the joint
surplus from the match exceeds the sum of the values for both parties staying
unmatched. This joint surplus is then split via Nash bargaining. There is free
entry of vacancies, so that in equilibrium, the value of maintaining a vacancy
equals zero. Matches are subject to idiosyncratic shocks, in which case they
are dissolved. Hence, the rate of job destruction is assumed to be exogenous.
Since we abstract from, for instance, dismissal costs, this assumption does not
qualitatively change our results (see Pissarides, 2000).
We extend the Mortensen and Pissarides (1994, 1999, 2003) framework
by allowing for a two-sector economy where sectors differ in their produc-
tivity. Such productivity differences between two sectors reverting to a pool
of homogenous workers can be motivated by structural differences within an
economy. For instance, Fuchs-Sch¨
undeln and Izem (2007) show that skill dif-
ferences between East and West German workers are negligible in contrast to
differences in job characteristics. Furthermore, it is a well-established fact in
the growth literature that two sectors with identical labor productivity might
exhibit different total factor productivities because one sector employs labor
more efficiently than the other sector.5 Hence, workers with a priori the same
productivity will be more (less) productive in relative terms if they are em-
ployed in the sector with higher (lower) productivity. This implies that workers
may be (i) unemployed (labelled by U), (ii) employed in the productive sector
E or (iii) employed in the unproductive sector L. Unemployment is the resid-
ual state in the sense that workers whose employment in either the productive
or unproductive sector ends due to an idiosyncratic shock flow back into un-
employment. We will see that, as a result of search frictions, both sectors
simultaneously exist, which also implies that wages in the productive sector
are higher than those in the unproductive sector. In a fully competitive labor
market, the wage differential would not exist (see e.g. Acemoglu, 2001).
5The aim our theoretical framework is not to model these sectoral productivity differ-
ences, but to analyze potential consequences of their existence.

The labor market flows are graphically represented by Figure 1, where  is
the job destruction rate. We assume equal exogenous job destruction across
sectors for simplicity without harming our results qualitatively. j
q(j
) is the
rate at which unemployed workers will find a job in sector j = E, L. The job
finding rates result from a Cobb-Douglas matching function Mj
= v
j
s(1-)
j
,
where vj
is the number of vacancies in sector j, sj
the number of workers
searching for a sector j job, and 0 <  < 1 is the elasticity of the matching
function.6 The assumption that both sectors have exactly the same matching
function is for simplicity and highlights the fact that differences in the matching
matching technology are not the source of the results. Defining labor market
tightness as j
= vj
/sj
yields q(j
) = Mj
/vj
= -
j
as the rate at which a
vacancy in j will be filled, with q(j
) = -(--1)

q(j
) = Mj
/sj
= (1-)
j
, with [j
q(j
)] =
(1 - )-
j
= (1 - )q(j
) > 0. It will become clear soon that, whenever
an unemployed worker is simultaneously offered a job in the productive and
the unproductive sector, he will join the productive sector as the wages paid
there are higher. Further, any worker in the unproductive sector getting a job
offer in the productive sector will change jobs for the same reason, while the
opposite never holds. This labor market structure is similar to the modelling
of two sectors by Albrecht et al. (2006). The flow equilibria are then given by
equalizing flows into and out of sectors E, L and unemployment U, respectively.
In the following, we describe the value functions of employers and workers in
more detail and derive equilibrium. It is important to note that our results
derived below do not change qualitatively once we assume job destruction rates
between sectors to differ, or that the rate of finding jobs in sector E differs
depending on whether searchers are in state U or L, respectively. Hence, we
assume equality for mathematical simplicity.
Let Vj
be the present discounted value of a vacancy in sector j and Jj
that of a filled job. It is straightforward that Vj
can then be expressed by the
Bellman equation
rVj
= -k + q(j
)[Jj
- Vj
], (1)
6Petrolongo and Pissarides (2001) have shown that a Cobb-Douglas matching function is
a good approximation to picture the stylized facts of labor markets. Therefore, the loss of
generality assuming a Cobb-Douglas matching function can be justified by the consistency
of such a function with empirical facts. Furthermore, it simplifies the analysis later on.

We assume  > 0, E

in which case the worker leaves the firm and the job is closed. That occurs at
rate E

Further, we assume free market entry and profit maximization of firms.
Then, we know that, in the steady-state equilibrium, the value of a vacancy

Equation (3) states that, in equilibrium, the expected present value of a job
in each sector must equal the average search costs (note that 1/q(j
) is the
average search duration for a vacancy in j).
The present discounted value of income for an unemployed worker U con-
sists of the expected income gain when finding a job in sector L plus the
expected income gain from finding a job in sector E. For simplicity, we ab-
stract from any non-labor income. Formally, this present value can be written
as

Note that these fractions perfectly correspond to the standard fractions in
which only one sector is active. To see this, simply set L
= 0. These fractions
allow us to state that sL
= u workers search for sector L jobs and sE
= u+l =
(1 - e) workers search for a job in sector E as those employed in sector L also
look for employment in E.
3 The Competitive Equilibrium
Given the present-value functions for firms and workers, we now have to de-
termine how the positive rent of a match is divided between the worker and
the firm. Following Pissarides (2000), we assume that wages are determined
by a Nash bargaining procedure where 0   < 1 is the bargaining power of
workers.8 The sharing rule is then given by Jj
= (1 - )[Wj
- U]. Using
equations (2) and (5), wages turn out to be given by
wj
= (1 + j
)y + (1 - ) {rU - (1 - j
)E
q(E
)[WE
- U]} . (9)
7Figure 1 describes the inflow and outflow of workers into and out of the different possible
situations. From there, we know that e evolves according to 
e = (1 - e - l) · E
q(E
) + l ·
E
q(E
)-e· and l according to 
l = (1-e-l)·L
q(L
)-l·-l·E
q(E
), where the dotted
variables indicate changes over time. As changes over time are zero in the steady state, we
can solve the preceding equations for e and l. Bearing in mind that u = (1 - e - l), because
the population size is normalized to one, allows us to derive equations (6) to (8).
8It could be reasonable to assume bargaining power of workers to be different in both
sectors, for example assuming  =  + =  to be the bargaining power of workers in sector
E and  the one in L. Again, this does not alter our results qualitatively, and hence we
abstract from this issue.
9
This states that wages must, in general, be at least as high as the outside
option of being unemployed, rU, and increase with increasing bargaining power
, which determines the fraction of a match surplus obtained by the worker.
Because workers employed in L have a chance of finding employment in E,
firms are able to squeeze the wage payment (which sector L employees will
accept according to the bargaining power represented by the last term on
the right-hand-side of equation (9)). It is straightforward to see that wages
for those workers employed in sector E exceed wages of those employed in
L, wE
> wL
because of, first, the chance of sector L employees of finding
employment in sector E and, second, because of the productivity difference
 > 0. Using equations (3) and (4) as well as the sharing rule from the wage
bargaining procedure to eliminate rU, competitive wages turn out to be
wj
=  {(1 + j
)y + k [L
+ j
E
]} . (10)
Substituting these wages into equation (3), the equilibrium job creation con-
ditions are given by
(1 - )y = kL
+ [r +  + E
q(E
)]

)
(11)
as the job creation condition for sector L (hereinafter JCL
) and
(1 - )(1 + )y = k[L
+ E
] + (r + )
k
q(E
)
(12)
as the job creation condition for sector E (hereinafter JCE
). Simultaneously
solving equations (11) and (12) determines the equilibrium values of market
tightness in sectors L and E. Note that equations (11) and (12) both generate
downward sloping curves in a L
/E
space which may cause existence and
stability problems regarding the equilibrium.
Proposition 1. There always exists a unique and stable equilibrium in which
both sectors L and E are simultaneously active as long as   0.
Proof. See Appendix A.
Given L
and E
from solving equations (11) and (12), we are able to
determine the steady-state fractions of workers employed in E, L and being
unemployed, U, by equations (6), (7), and (8), respectively.
10
4 Equilibrium with a Minimum Wage
Assume now that there exists a government which considers wages paid in
sector L "not to be fair" for whatever exogenously given reason (e.g. some
not explicitly modelled election campaigns, distributional considerations, an
`equal work-equal pay' attitude, etc.) while it agrees with the wage payments
in sector E. In order to correct for the "unfair" wage payments in sector L, the
government imposes a minimum wage m  [wL
, wE
] to lower the wage gap.9
In the presence of a minimum wage, the firms' "asset pricing" function in
sector L, equation (2), re-writes to
rJm
L
= y - m + [VL
- Jm
L
] + E
q(E
)[VL
- Jm
L
], (13)
where the superscript m indicates the presence of a minimum wage, while the
employed sector L workers' present value of income is, referring to equation
(5), represented by
rWm
L
= m + [U - Wm
L
] + E
q(E
)[WE
- Wm
L
]. (14)
Note that, in principle, nothing changes for sector E firms and employed sector
E workers ceteris paribus, because the minimum wage is assumed to be equal
to or below the wage bargained there. Further, market tightness in L and E is
given from the individual worker's and firm's perspective. This implies that, for
given L
and E
, sector L workers gain r[Wm
L
-WL
] = m-wL
= m-[y+kL
],
where we define a = m - [y + kL
] as the mark-up on the competitive wage
induced by the minimum wage, i.e. the additional payment exceeding the
market wage.
As, in the presence of a binding minimum wage (i.e. m > wL
), workers
employed in sector L attain higher wage payments, this feeds back on the
utility of unemployment. The present value of income for unemployed work-
ers in the presence of a minimum wage can thus be expressed by rUm =
E
q(E
)[WE
- Um] + L
q(L
)[Wm
L
- Um]. Using the present value of income
for unemployed workers in the absence of a minimum wage, equation (4), and
the utility difference of being employed in sector L, [Wm
L
- WL
], equation (14)
minus equation (5), the utility difference of unemployment can be expressed
9Note that we do not mean to make any judgment regarding fairness issues and are
simply interested in the steady-state employment and welfare effects of imposing some sort
of minimum wage in one sector of a two-sector economy exogenously.

which is greater than zero as long as a > 0 (i.e. the minimum wage is binding)
for given market tightness in E and L.
Hence, even though sector E is not directly influenced by the minimum
wage in L, the potentially increased utility of unemployment, as represented
by equation (15), generates feedback. To see this, remember how wages are
bargained. We know that the wage is a fraction of the match-specific payoff
(depending on the bargaining power of workers) plus the utility of unemploy-
ment. As the latter changes in the presence of a minimum wage, so does the
wage bargained in sector E, which now yields wm
E
= (1+)y+(1-)Um (see
equation (9)). Using equation (15) and rUm = rU + r[Um - U] to eliminate
rUm, we get

As long as there is no binding minimum wage (i.e. a = 0), the wage bargained
in sector E is the competitive one. Using the minimum wage and a = m-[y+

where the superscript m on the equilibrium values indicates that this is the

12
(17) and (18) determines the equilibrium values for market tightness in sectors
L and E in the presence of a minimum wage m
L
and m
E
. For a = 0 (i.e.
there exists no binding minimum wage), the equilibrium boils down to the
competitive equilibrium. It is furthermore a straightforward matter to show
and handy to remember that, for a minimum wage equal to sector L wage
payments, i.e. m = wL
, the equilibrium values for market tightness in sectors
L and E will be the same, i.e. L
= m

and E

.10
Proposition 2. There always exists a unique and stable equilibrium in which
both sectors L and E are active in the presence of a minimum wage as long as
  0 and y > m.
Proof. See Appendix B.
Again, given m
L
and m
E
from solving equations (17) and (18), we are now
able to determine the fractions of workers employed in E, L and being unem-
ployed, U, in the presence of a minimum wage m by equations (6), (7), and
(8), respectively.
5 Comparing Equilibria
In order to analyze the employment effects of an increase of the minimum
wage m  [wL

respectively. We have made use of the fact that da = dm - kdL
and the
Cobb-Douglas matching function which implies 0 <  = -jq(j)
q(j)
< 1.
From equation (19) we see that, as already indicated above, market tight-
ness L
ceteris paribus decreases with increasing market tightness E
because
10For this to hold, the job creation conditions for sectors L and E in the absence and in
the presence of a minimum wage have to be the same. After subtracting equation (11) from
equation (17) and equation (12) from equation (18), we find that this is unambiguously the
case for m = [y + kL
] = wL
.
13
a higher probability of finding a job in E for workers reduces the average du-
ration of a job in L and, thus, reduces the incentive for job creation there.
Further, a higher minimum wage m increases labor costs and, therefore, also
reduces the incentive for job creation in L.
Equation (20) states that job creation in E (represented by market tightness
E
) decreases with increasing market tightness L
and the minimum wage m
ceteris paribus. This is because both increase the workers' outside option (L
because of the higher probability of finding a job in L and m because of higher
payments whenever a job in L is found) which increases wage costs in sector
E, see equation (16). This reduces the incentives for job creation.
To calculate the final effects of an increase in the minimum wage on job
creation in L and E, we have to combine all these effects. In doing so, we find,
after rearranging equations (19) and (20) that (calculations can be retraced in
Appendix D)

while y

> 1 is a necessary condition in order for both sectors to exist (see
Proposition 2). Thus, from equations (21) and (22), we see that an increase
in the minimum wage in sector L decreases job creation in sector E as long as
y > m while its effects on job creation in sector L itself are ambiguous. This
implies that a minimum wage in the unproductive sector may indeed yield
higher job creation in this sector compared to a situation without minimum
wages (nevertheless, the opposite may also hold true). However, the minimum
wage unambiguously reduces job creation in the productive sector which is
14
indeed not directly influenced by it.11 From an intuitive point of view, this
may seem odd at first sight and certainly warrants some explanation.
As we already know, the increase of the minimum wage increases wage costs
in L, which reduces job creation in L ceteris paribus. Further, it augments the
workers' outside option ceteris paribus and thus increases labor costs in sector
E which reduces the incentive for job creation in E. This reduced job creation
in E decreases the likelihood that employees in L will find employment in E
and thus leave sector L. Hence, the firms' discounting in sector L is decreased
which ceteris paribus increases the incentive for job creation in L. Regarding
sector E, the potential decrease in job creation in sector L, however, is not
able to compensate for the increase in expected wage costs, which implies
that the workers' outside option and thus wage costs in E will unambiguously
increase even though sector E is not directly affected by the minimum wage.
Therefore, job creation in E unambiguously falls (see equation (22)). Whether
job creation in L ultimately rises or falls depends crucially on whether higher
wage costs or reduced discounting dominate (see equation (21), where the
first term of the denominator on the right-hand side represents the reduced
discounting effect and the second term the higher wage effect).
To be more precise, let's rearrange the numerator on the right-hand side
of equation (21) to find that job creation in the unproductive sector rises if

introduction of a minimum wage for sector L on job creation in sector L
(resulting from reduced job creation in E and, hence, changes in average job
duration). If this indirect effect dominates the direct effect of an increase in
minimum wages, i.e. -1 · dm (see equation (19)), job creation in L rises.
Otherwise, it falls. To put it differently, only if the reduction in the risk of

wage, which initially implies a = 0.
15
losing a sector L worker to sector E because of less productive job creation is
high enough and, thus, sufficiently prolongs the expected duration of a sector
L job, higher wage costs can be overcompensated and job creation in L can
rise. Whether or not this is the case, of course, depends on the parametric
specification of the model and will ultimately be an empirical question.
Our results imply that the introduction of a minimum wage unambiguously
decreases employment in the productive sector E as E
falls (see equations
(22) and (6)). If the fall in E
is not large enough to compensate for the
higher wage payments in L (i.e. condition (24) does not hold), job creation in
sector L also falls. This implies less job creation in sectors L and E, which
unambiguously generates higher unemployment (see equation (8)). The effects
on sector L employment are then ambiguous (see equation (7)) because, while
the job finding rate in sector L for unemployed workers has fallen, the pool of
unemployment has increased. On the contrary, if the reduction in E
is large
enough to generate additional job creation in L (i.e. condition (24) holds), this
unambiguously increases employment l due to higher job creation in L and less
job creation in E (see equation (7)), whereas, the effects on unemployment are
ambiguous (see equation (8)).
Hence, we find that a minimum wage may increase the overall level of
employment. But even if overall employment rises, however, this comes at the
cost of lower levels of productive and higher levels of unproductive employment.
6 Welfare Implications
The above findings, of course, make it necessary to assess some welfare implica-
tions of minimum wages in our setup. Regarding welfare, we follow Pissarides
(2000) and take the present value of production (minus search costs) as a
welfare measure which is given by
 =

0
e-rt[(1 + )y · e + y · l - kL
· (1 - e - l)
=u
-kE
· (1 - e)]dt, (25)
where (1+)y·e equals the current level of production in the productive sector,
y·l is the current level of production in the unproductive sector, kL
(1-e-l)+
kE
(1 - e) constitutes total search costs and t represents time. Wages are not
taken into account separately as they only determine how current production
is distributed among workers and firms. Employment e and l evolve over time
16
according to (see also Figure 1 and footnote 7)

e =

q(E
) - e ·  (26)
and

l =

= (1 - e - l) · L
q(L
) - l ·  - l · E
q(E
). (27)
By maximizing equation (25) subject to (26) and (27) and some rearranging,
we can describe the socially optimal values of market tightness L
and market
tightness E
by the following two equations (calculations are, in principle, in
perfect analogy to Pissarides, 2000, p. 189 and are therefore not repeated
here).

(29)
as the optimal job creation condition in sector E (hereinafter JC
E
), where the
superscript  indicates that these are the welfare-optimal values. Again, it can
be shown in analogy to the proofs of Propositions 1 and 2 that the JCE
curve's
L
-axis intercept is higher than the one of the JC
L
curve as long as   0,
and that the JC
E
curve intersects the E
-axis while the JC
L
curve never
does. Therefore, the curves intersect. Thus, these two equations determine
the socially optimal levels of market tightness 
L
and 
E
. For the competitive
market to reach a first-best allocation, market tightness L
and E
, given by
equations (11) and (12), have to equal market tightness 
L
and 
E
, given by
equations (28) and (29). As we directly see, this will generally not be the case
which implies that the competitive equilibrium is likely to be inefficient.
The result that the market equilibrium is, generally, inefficient is not new
in a model with search frictions. In the standard one sector economy, the
well-known Hosios condition states that matching efficiency  must equal the
workers' bargaining power  in order to achieve an efficient solution (see Hosios,
1990 and Pissarides, 2000). By comparing equation (11) with equation (28)
and equation (12) with equation (29), we see that this ceteris paribus generates
an "optimal" job creation condition for sector L. However, even then, in the
market equilibrium, there is still too much job creation in the productive sector
E (formally captured by a different last term on the rhs of equation (29)).
Correspondingly, there will be too little job creation in L in the competitive
17
equilibrium because dL
/dE
< 0. This implies that the Hosios condition by
itself (namely,  = ) is not sufficient to generate an efficient market outcome
in a two-sector search economy.
The reason for this is as follows. Due to the productivity advantage  > 0,
firms are too eager to create jobs in the productive sector from a social planner's
perspective as they fail to internalize the congestion externality caused by
individual vacancy posting in E. Too many vacancies, however, expand search
duration and, thus, increase search costs for the entire economy. Thus, from a
welfare point of view, there is a trade-off between a higher level of production
(caused by the increase in the number of sector E jobs) and higher search
costs (caused by the congestion externality). This even holds whenever the
bargaining power of workers  coincidentally equals the matching elasticity  as
implied by the standard Hosios condition. To put it differently, in the optimal
equilibrium (given by equations (28) and (29)) compared to the competitive
market equilibrium (given by equations (11) and (12)), the productivity loss
from a decline in the number of productive jobs is compensated for by lower
search costs and growth of unproductive jobs. Hence, the social planner would
chose fewer productive and more unproductive jobs rather than end up in the
competitive equilibrium. Therefore, the Hosios condition must be modified in
a two-sector search model as labor costs in sector E are too low even when
 =  (see equations (28) and (29)).
This implies that a minimum wage in L, even though it is comes the cost of
less productive employment, may be welfare-enhancing because it may exactly
do what a social planner would do, i.e. generate higher labor costs and, thus,
fewer jobs in E and ­ potentially ­ more jobs in L (i.e. if condition (24) holds).
However, comparing the optimality conditions with the equilibrium conditions
in the presence of a minimum wage, i.e. equation (28) with equation (17) and
(29) with equation (18), we find that the social optimal solution cannot be
reached by choosing a minimum wage alone. By subtracting equation (28) from
equation (17), we find that the mark-up a should be chosen as to compensate
for the difference between matching elasticity and bargaining power,
a

which unambiguously exceeds the previous "optimal" minimum wage (a

<

E
). This implies that there is no one minimum wage to achieve the optimal
equilibrium solution. Even if the minimum wage is chosen such that one of
the two optimality conditions, i.e. equations (28) or (29), holds, the other one
is not fulfilled and the outcome under minimum wages will still be inefficient
compared to the optimum. Nevertheless, we can basically learn three things
that are important for choosing an adequate minimum wage.
First, if the bargaining power of workers falls short of the matching elastic-
ity, i.e.  < , a binding minimum wage ­ if accordingly chosen (i.e. a  a
L
)
­ is likely to improve welfare as it may drive the equilibrium closer to the
optimality condition for sector L . This result is in the spirit of findings for
monopsony models or models with monopsonistic competition (and relatively
few competitors on the labor demand side). Minimum wages may be welfare-
improving if they are able to decrease the "abuse" of power by those who
demand labor.
Second, if the bargaining power of workers exceeds the matching elasticity,
i.e  > , labor costs for unproductive work ­ already too high measured in
terms of the optimality condition ­ will be increased further, while the con-
dition for optimal productive work, i.e. a
E
, can theoretically be fulfilled. In
this case, however, the government must implement additional measures to
compensate for the labor costs in the unproductive sector. From the perspec-
tive of these two points, a minimum wage itself only seems to make sense as
long as the bargaining power of workers is small (relative to the matching elas-
ticity). Otherwise, the introduction of a minimum wage would, according to
our framework, cost productive labor (see section 5) and also decrease welfare
whenever no other measures are taken by the government to compensate for
this loss.
Third, to make this point very clear, a minimum wage optimally chosen for
either the unproductive or productive sector (according to the two previous
equations for a
L
or a
E
) must additionally be supplemented by either subsidiz-
ing unproductive labor (if the minimum wage is chosen to generate the optimal
productive job creation condition, a = a
E
) to not make labor costs for unpro-
ductive work too high, or by taxing productive labor (if the minimum wage is
chosen to generate optimal job creation in the unproductive sector, a = a
L
)
19
in order to compensate for the congestion externality caused by the fact that,
from an individual perspective, it is still more attractive to create jobs in the
more productive sector.
7 Conclusions
We have presented a two-sector search model that extends the matching frame-
work of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994, 1999, 2003) and Pissarides (2000) by
introducing an additional sector. The economy consists of a productive and
an unproductive sector, but following a modified approach of Albrecht et al.
(2006), both sectors revert to the same pool of homogeneous workers. In the
competitive equilibrium, wages paid in the productive sector are higher than
those paid in the unproductive sector as in Acemoglu (2001). We assume that,
in order to compensate for this wage gap, the government decides to introduce
a minimum wage in the unproductive sector which is smaller than (or, at most,
equal to) the competitive wage bargained in the productive sector.
Our first main result is that the minimum wage unambiguously reduces job
creation and employment only in the productive sector, while its employment
effect on the unproductive sector is ambiguous. This result stems from the fact
that a minimum wage in the unproductive sector ceteris paribus increases the
unemployed workers' outside option, as any employment in the unproductive
sector now yields a higher wage. An increasing outside option improves their
bargaining position and ability to demand higher wages in the productive sec-
tor, leaving firms less willing to hire. However, if productive job creation falls,
the chances of unproductive employees of finding employment in the produc-
tive sector will fall as well, and the average duration of jobs increases in the
unproductive sector. On the one hand, this may trigger more job creation;
on the other hand, however, higher wage costs decrease the incentive for job
creation in the unproductive sector. Ultimately, the employment effect in the
unproductive sector depends on which of these effects dominates. What are
the consequences of a minimum-wage-induced increase in the outside option
for the productive sector? We find that even a decrease in job creation in
the unproductive sector is not able to compensate for higher earnings from a
job found in the unproductive sector. Consequently, wage costs of employees
always increase and job creation unambiguously falls in the productive sector.
What are the overall effects on employment? While economy-wide unemploy-
20
ment increases whenever job creation in the unproductive sector decreases,
the effects on unemployment are ambiguous whenever job creation in the un-
productive sector increases (due to more inflows from the productive sector
and more outflows to the unproductive sector). This implies that a minimum
wage in a two-sector search economy harms productive employment, while its
effects on the unproductive sector are ambiguous. It is especially noteworthy
that, even if aggregated employment rises, this comes at a cost to productive
employment.
At first sight, this seems to worsen welfare. However, following Pissarides
(2000) and taking aggregated production minus search costs as a welfare mea-
sure, we are able to calculate an analogue to the well-known Hosios condition
in the two-sector search economy. In the conventional matching model, the
Hosios condition states that social optimum is reached whenever the bargain-
ing power of workers equals the matching elasticity. We draw the following
conclusions with respect to welfare from our model. A minimum wage that
exceeds the competitive wage in the unproductive sector of a two-sector search
economy is most likely welfare-improving if the bargaining power of workers
is sufficiently low (i.e. it falls short of the matching elasticity). Nevertheless,
a single minimum wage cannot yield the first-best solution because there may
still be too much job creation in the productive sector (thus making search
costs are high) from a welfare perspective. Hence, the government must addi-
tionally impose taxes in the productive sector to increase labor costs or, when
choosing the minimum wage that makes labor costs in the productive sector
sufficiently high, subsidize employment in the unproductive sector. The mini-
mum wage alone is not able to achieve social optimum. However, all this can
only be achieved at the cost of less productive employment. We would like to
underline once more that these welfare implications crucially depend on the
parameters on bargaining power and the matching elasticity. Policymakers
that take the introduction of a minimum wage into consideration should care-
fully seek empirical estimates for these parameters. Flinn (2006), for example,
finds that the workers' bargaining power exceeds the matching elasticity (al-
though not by much) in the United States. Irrespective of the exact estimates,
policymakers have to bear in mind that a minimum wage in the unproductive
sector will unambiguously reduce employment in the productive sector.
There are, however, some limitations in the analysis presented above. The
conventional monopsonistic competition assumes that, first, minimum wages
21
create incentives for innovation or education which, in turn, increase (aggre-
gated) productivity (see Lechthaler and Snower, 2008, as a recent example).
If that were the case in our model, the incentive to reduce job creation in the
unproductive sector would decline. Second, one should carefully examine the
role of competitive wage setting. The above analysis is conducted for indi-
vidual wage bargaining. However, we know that wage setting plays a role for
labor market outcomes concerning taxation (see e.g. Sinko, 2007), employment
protection and/or experience rating (see e.g. Baumann and St¨
ahler, 2008, and
St¨
ahler, 2008). Therefore, the wage setting structure may also play a role
whenever we consider a two-sector economy in which competitive wages are
set by, for example, unions. We leave these issues for further research because
­ as simple as the model may be ­ the effects and results in the present paper
have, to the best of our knowledge, not been analyzed before. Further, we offer
an alternative way to introduce sectoral differences into matching models that
may also be useful for addressing other questions.

Mathematical Appendix
A Proof of Proposition 1
From totally differentiating equation (11) we know that the JCL
curve is down-
ward sloping in a L
/E
space and, from equation (11) itself, that, as L
ap-
proaches zero, E
approaches infinity. The JCE
curve is also downward sloping
in a L
/E
space. However, for L
= 0, there exists a positive level of E
be-
yond which L
would turn negative. This implies that, as long as the L
-axis
intercept of the JCE
curve is above the one of the JCL
curve, the curves must
intersect and, thus, there will exist an equilibrium. Assuming E
= 0 for a
moment and dividing the left- and right-hand sides of equations (12) by those
of equation (11), we see that this yields
L|JCE
L|JCL
+ (r + )
L|JCL
= (1 + ), (31)
where L|JCE
is the axis intercept of the JCE
curve and L|JCL
that of the
JCL
curve, respectively. We see that as long as  > 0, i.e. as long as there
is a productivity advantage in sector E as presumed, the JCE
's axis intercept
must be larger than the one of the JCL
(because the right-hand side is greater
one which implies that, for the left-hand side to be that, too, L|JCE
> L|JCL
has to hold). Note that the same holds for  = 0.
Regarding stability, we know that the determinant of the Jacobian ( ~
J) of
the system of equations (11) and (12) is given by (calculations can be retraced
in Appendix C)
| ~
J| = [r +  + E

, (32)
which has, in principle, an ambiguous sign. We know, however, that both
curves are monotonically falling. As the JCE
curve's L
-axis intercept in a
L
/E
space is larger than the one of the JCL
curve, and as the JCE
curve
turns negative for some positive level of E
, while the JCL
curve does not,
the JCE
curve must be steeper than the JCL
curve in equilibrium (i.e. when
both curves intersect). This implies that | ~
J| > 0 for the equilibrium values of
L
and E
(see Appendix C for more formal details). Still, the equilibrium is
stable as

which implies that the equilibrium is a stable node. Thus, the equilibrium
unambiguously exists and is unique and stable as long as   0.
B Proof of Proposition 2
From equation (17) we see that, as long as y > m, it is worth opening a
vacancy in L. Otherwise, the minimum wage would exceed marginal worker's
productivity and, thus, sector L would be destroyed (i.e L
= 0). Hence, the
maximum minimum wage for both sectors to simultaneously exist is restricted
by y.
Further, as in the competitive equilibrium, the JCm
L
curve is downward
sloping in an L
/E
space. E
approaches infinity as L
approaches zero (i.e.
the JCm
L
curve always takes positive values). From the JCm
E
curve, equation
(18), it is straightforward to see that there is a positive level of E
on the
downward sloping JCm
E
curve for which L
turns negative. Again, the L
-axis
intercept of the JCm
E
curve in a L
/E
space is above the one of the JCm
L
curve
for   0. This becomes obvious by assuming m
E
= 0 and dividing both sides
of equations (18) by both sides of equation (17), which yields
km

Because 0 < m

Hence, both curves intersect. The determinant of the Jacobian of the system
of equations (17) and (18) is given by

which has, in equilibrium, a positive sign (| ^

(33), respectively.
We know that | ~

curve, and because the JCE
curves turns negative for a positive level of E
in the L

space while the

curve must be steeper than the JCL

least until but most likely beyond the E

J| = BB ·CC -AA·DD > 0 (see equation (32)).
Regarding the situation with a binding minimum wage, the totally differ-
entiated equilibrium conditions in the presence of a minimum wage, equations
(17) and (18), are given by equations (19) and (20), respectively. From these
equations, it is straightforward to calculate the determinant of the Jacobian of
this system of equations as given in equation (35) while the corresponding trace
25
is given by equation (36). The same formal argument regarding the slope's of
the JCL
and JCE
curves can be made in order to find | ^
J| > 0. It is easy
to see that the qualitative properties are the same as under the competitive
equilibrium and, thus, the equilibrium is stable.
