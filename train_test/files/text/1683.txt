DIABETIC RETINOPATHY IS THE
leading cause of new cases of
legal blindness among adults
aged 20 to 74 years in the
United States.1 Vision loss due to dia-
betic retinopathy occurs through a va-
riety of mechanisms, including retinal
detachment, preretinal or vitreous hem-
orrhage, associated neovascular glau-
coma, and macular edema or capillary
nonperfusion.2 The presence of dia-
betic retinopathy may indicate micro-
circulatory dysfunction in other organ
systems.3,4 Diabetes-related blindness is
a personal catastrophe to the indi-
vidual and costs the United States ap-
proximately $500 million annually.5
However, risk of vision loss due to dia-
betic retinopathy can be reduced by ef-
fective control of serum glucose and
blood pressure and by its early detec-
tion and timely treatment.6-8 The effi-
cacy and cost-effectiveness of early de-
tection and treatment of diabetic
retinopathy is well established.9,10
Investigating the prevalence of dia-
betic retinopathy is important be-
cause it is a key indicator of systemic
diabetic microvascular complications,
and as such, a sentinel indicator of the
impact of diabetes. Despite the docu-
mented increase in the prevalence of
diabetes in the US population,11 na-
tional population-based data on the
prevalence and severity of diabetic reti-
nopathy remain scarce, with previous
nationwide prevalence estimates dat-
ing back to 1988-1994 (National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys III
[NHANES III]).12 In 2004, the Eye
Diseases Prevalence Research Group es-
timated the prevalence of diabetic reti-
nopathy from the compilation of 8 sepa-

Context The prevalence of diabetes in the United States has increased. People with
diabetes are at risk for diabetic retinopathy. No recent national population-based es-
timate of the prevalence and severity of diabetic retinopathy exists.
Objectives To describe the prevalence and risk factors of diabetic retinopathy among
US adults with diabetes aged 40 years and older.
Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of a cross-sectional, nationally repre-
sentative sample of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2008
(N=1006). Diabetes was defined as a self-report of a previous diagnosis of the disease
(excluding gestational diabetes mellitus) or glycated hemoglobin A1c
of 6.5% or greater.
Two fundus photographs were taken of each eye with a digital nonmydriatic camera and
were graded using the Airlie House classification scheme and the Early Treatment Dia-
betic Retinopathy Study severity scale. Prevalence estimates were weighted to represent
the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population aged 40 years and older.
Main Outcome Measurements Diabetic retinopathy and vision-threatening dia-
betic retinopathy.
Results The estimated prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and vision-threatening
diabetic retinopathy was 28.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.9%-32.5%) and
4.4% (95% CI, 3.5%-5.7%) among US adults with diabetes, respectively. Diabetic
retinopathy was slightly more prevalent among men than women with diabetes
(31.6%; 95% CI, 26.8%-36.8%; vs 25.7%; 95% CI, 21.7%-30.1%; P=.04). Non-
Hispanic black individuals had a higher crude prevalence than non-Hispanic white
individuals of diabetic retinopathy (38.8%; 95% CI, 31.9%-46.1%; vs 26.4%; 95%
CI, 21.4%-32.2%; P=.01) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (9.3%; 95%
CI, 5.9%-14.4%; vs 3.2%; 95% CI, 2.0%-5.1%; P=.01). Male sex was indepen-
dently associated with the presence of diabetic retinopathy (odds ratio [OR], 2.07;
95% CI, 1.39-3.10), as well as higher hemoglobin A1c
level (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20-
1.75), longer duration of diabetes (OR, 1.06 per year duration; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10),
insulin use (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.99-5.26), and higher systolic blood pressure (OR,
1.03 per mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03).
Conclusion In a nationally representative sample of US adults with diabetes aged
40 years and older, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and vision-threatening dia-
betic retinopathy was high, especially among Non-Hispanic black individuals.

rate population-based studies from the
United States and elsewhere con-
ducted in the late 1980s or early
1990s.13 Their report recommended
that more recent estimates of diabetic
retinopathy prevalence be obtained
from the nationally representative
sample of NHANES.
Moreover, several other population-
based studies reported a decrease in the
prevalence and incidence of severe dia-
betic retinopathy and related visual im-
pairment.14-16 However, these findings
were limited to regional cohorts and the
status of diabetic retinopathy at the na-
tional level remains unknown. Thus,
the principal aim of this study is to de-
scribe the most recent prevalence and
risk factors of diabetic retinopathy in
the US population aged 40 years and
older using NHANES 2005-2008.
METHODS
Study Population
NHANES are national representative
surveys conducted by the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics, part of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion. The data consist of samples of the
US noninstitutionalized civilian popu-
lation, which were obtained using a
stratified multistage probability de-
sign with planned oversampling of cer-
tain age and racial/ethnic groups.17
There were 6797 individuals aged 40
years and older interviewed for socio-
demographic, medical, and family in-
formation and had a full medical ex-
amination at the medical examination
center in NHANES 2005-2008. The
NHANES 2005-2008 response rate for
the interview sample aged 40 years and
older was 71% and 69% for the exam-
ined sample.18 The NHANES protocol
was approved by a human subjects re-
view board and written informed con-
sent was obtained from all partici-
pants.
Fundus Photography
NHANES 2005-2008 used the Canon
CR6-45NM ophthalmic digital imaging
system and Canon EOS 10D digital
camera (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) to take
2 digital images per eye (total 4 im-
ages per participant) through a non-
pharmacologically dilated pupil. Par-
ticipants were seated in a windowless
room with the lights turned off to al-
low the pupils to dilate naturally in
preparation for the retinal imaging ex-
amination. One image was centered on
the macula and the second on the op-
tic nerve. The digital images were
graded by masked photo graders at the
University of Wisconsin Ocular Epide-
miologic Reading Center, Madison,
using a modification of the Airlie House
classification system.19-21 Capture and
grading of digital images and quality
control by the Wisconsin group have
been described in detail previously.22
Survey participants who had no light
perception or severe visual impair-
ment in both eyes or had a severe in-
fection in one or both eyes were ex-
cluded (n = 13). Complete data of
fundus photographs of both eyes were
obtained for 5371 (79%) participants
aged 40 years and older who had full
medical examinations.
Reasons for having incomplete data
(n=1426, 21%) included insufficient
time to finish the examination (ie, ar-
rived late or left early; n=514; 42%),
physical limitation (n=238; 19%), eye-
specific limitation (n=193; 16%), par-
ticipant's refusal (n=119; 10%), com-
munication problems (n=40; 3%), and
others. Those individuals with incom-
plete data were more likely to be older,
non-Hispanic black, with less than a
high school education, higher systolic
blood pressure, higher glycated hemo-
globin A1c
level, and a history of using
insulin than participants with com-
plete gradable photographs (all
P.001). We further examined the po-
tential influence of nonresponse bias
due to the exclusion of participants
without complete gradable photo-
graphs by adjusting the original sam-
pling weights using the standard
weighting­class method.23,24 Findings
using these adjusted weights led to only
minor differences in point and vari-
ance estimates (0%-0.5%), indicating
minimal impact of nonresponse; there-
fore, we present all estimates using the
original sampling weights.
Diabetic retinopathy was defined as
the presence of 1 or more retinal mi-
croaneurysms or retinal blot hemor-
rhages with or without more severe le-
sions (hard exudates, soft exudates,
intraretinal microvascular abnormali-
ties, venous beading, retinal new ves-
sels, preretinal and vitreous hemor-
rhage, and fibroproliferans) using the
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
Study (ETDRS) grading standards.19
Diabetic retinopathy was further
categorized as nonproliferative and
proliferative determined by assess-
ment of the presence of retinal neo-
vascularization or abnormal growth of
new retinal blood vessels into the vit-
reous. Vision-threatening diabetic
retinopathy, a level that may soon
result in vision loss if left untreated,
was defined as the presence of severe
nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy,
proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or
clinically significant macular edema.
Clinically significant macular edema
was considered present when edema
involved the fovea or was within 500
microns of the fovea, or when a
1disc area of edema was present
with at least a portion of it within the
macula. Outcomes for this study were
defined on the basis of the worse of
the 2 eyes.
Other Measurements
Diabetes was defined as self-report of
a previous diagnosis of the disease by
a clinician (excluding gestational dia-
betes mellitus) or hemoglobin A1c
of
6.5% or greater (American Diabetes As-
sociation's new diagnostic criterion for
undiagnosed diabetes).25 Although he-
moglobin A1c
does not capture com-
pletely the increased risk of microvas-
cular complications due to diabetes,26
the diagnostic hemoglobin A1c
cut point
of 6.5% was determined to be an in-
flection point for retinopathy preva-
lence, as is also true for the diagnostic
thresholds of the glucose-based
test.25,27,28 The final analytic sample con-
sisted of 1006 individuals with diabe-
tes aged 40 years and older (n=795 for
diagnosed diabetes; n=211 for undiag-
nosed diabetes).

All participants were asked about
their age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican American, and others [includ-
ing those who selected multiple races
and non-Mexican American Hispan-
ics]), educational attainment (less than
high school, high school education, or
higher), and health insurance status.
Consistent with previous epidemio-
logic studies,29-31 risk factors for dia-
betic retinopathy and vision-threaten-
ing diabetic retinopathy (hemoglobin
A1c
, duration of diabetes, insulin use
[yes/no], systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, body mass index [BMI, cal-
culated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared], cur-
rent smoking status [yes/no], and
historyofcardiovasculardiseases[CVD;
yes/no]) were examined. Hemoglobin
A1c
, duration of diabetes, and systolic
and diastolic blood pressure were used
as continuous variables. Hemoglobin
A1c
was used as the surrogate for blood
glucose level and measured by a high-
performance liquid chromatographic
assay as used in the Diabetes Control
and Complications Trial.7 Insulin
therapy indicated that the participant
had type 1 diabetes or their diabetes
could not otherwise be controlled with-
out insulin. We used measured height
and weight to calculate BMI and di-
vided respondents into 3 groups: nor-
mal/underweight (BMI25), over-
weight (BMI 25-30), and obese
(BMI 30). Prior history of CVD was
ascertained by self-report of coronary
heart disease, angina, myocardial
infarction, stroke, or congestive heart
failure.
Statistical Methods
Statistical analyses were conducted
using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina) and SUDAAN
version 10.1 software (Research Tri-
angle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina) to calculate national
estimates and their standard errors
while accounting for the complex sur-
vey design of the survey. Taylor series
linearization was used for variance es-
timation.32 The NHANES 2005-2008
study has sufficient sample size to de-
tect a relative difference of 6% (effec-
tive sample size=sample size/design
effect=1006/1.7=591) at 85% power
and an  level of .05.
Characteristics of the study popula-
tion are described using means for con-
tinuous variables and percentages for
categorical variables. For continuous
variables, t tests were used and for cat-
egorical variables the 2 test. We esti-
mated the crude prevalence of dia-
beticretinopathyandvision-threatening
diabetic retinopathy by age, sex, and
race/ethnicity in the diabetic and over-
all US population. Multiple logistic re-
gressions were used to assess the asso-
ciation between diabetic retinopathy
and vision-threatening diabetic reti-
nopathy, vs clinical potential risk fac-
tors for diabetic retinopathy and vision-
threatening diabetic retinopathy after
controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and education attainment.
Predictive margins, odds ratios (OR),
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
each were calculated. Associations were
considered to be significant if the P
value was less than .05. Additionally,
we compared the prevalence of dia-
betic retinopathy and vision-threaten-
ing diabetic retinopathy in NHANES
2005-2008 with NHANES III by using
the right eye if the last digit of the par-
ticipant identification number was even
and the left eye if it was odd. The preva-
lence estimates were age standardized
to the 2000 US census population.
RESULTS
In 2005-2008, the estimated (weighted)
crude prevalence of diabetic retinopa-
thy and vision-threatening diabetic
retinopathy was 28.5% (95% CI, 24.9%-
32.5%) and 4.4% (95% CI, 3.5%-5.7%),
respectively, among persons with dia-
betes aged 40 years and older (TABLE 1).
Extrapolating to the overall US popula-
tion in the same period, the prevalence
nation wide would be 3.8% (95% CI,
3.2%-4.5%) and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.5%-
0.8%). Approximately 1.5% (95% CI,
1.1%-2.2%) of adults with diabetes
had proliferative diabetic retinopathy
and 2.7% (95% CI, 1.8%-4.0%) had
clinically significant macular edema. In
other words, approximately 0.2% (95%
CI, 0.1%-0.3%) of adults aged 40 years
or older had proliferative diabetic reti-
nopathy and 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-
0.5%) had clinically significant macu-
lar edema.
Among individuals with diabetes, no
significant difference was found in the
prevalence of diabetic retinopathy
between those aged 40 to 64 years and
those aged 65 years and older (28.0%;
95% CI, 23.0%-33.6%; vs 29.5%; 95%
CI, 25.4%-33.9%; P=.64). Approxi-
mately 31.6% (95% CI, 26.8%-36.8%)
of men with diabetes had diabetic
retinopathy and approximately 25.7%
(95% CI, 21.7%-30.1%) of women with
diabetes had diabetic retinopathy
(P=.04). Approximately 26.4% (95%
CI, 21.4%-32.2%) of non-Hispanic
white individuals, 38.8% (95% CI,
31.9%-46.1%) of non-Hispanic black
individuals, and 34.0% (95% CI,
26.7%-42.1%) of Mexican American
individuals with diabetes had diabetic
retinopathy (P=.008). Prevalence of
vision-threatening diabetic retinopa-
thy was not statistically different
betweenindividualsaged40to64years
andthoseaged65yearsandolder(4.1%;
95% CI, 2.8%-5.8%; vs 5.1%; 95% CI,
3.5%-7.3%; P=.41). There was no sig-
nificant difference in the prevalence of
vision-threatening diabetic retinopa-
thy between men and women (4.2%;
95% CI, 2.8%-6.1%; vs 4.7%, 95% CI,
3.2%-6.9%; P=.67). Approximately
3.2% (95% CI, 2.0%-5.1%) of non-
Hispanic white individuals, 9.3% (95%
CI, 5.9%-14.4%) of non-Hispanic black
individuals, and 7.3% (95% CI, 3.9%-
13.3%) of Mexican American individu-
als with diabetes had vision-threaten-
ing diabetic retinopathy (P=.006).
Extrapolating survey findings to the
entire US adult population in the same
period (without regard for diabetes sta-
tus), the prevalence of diabetic reti-
nopathy was significantly higher among
individuals who were aged 65 years or
older than those younger than 65 years
of age (6.1%; 95% CI, 5.1%-7.3%; vs
3.1%; 95% CI, 2.4%-3.9% P.001). Ap-
proximately 4.3% (95% CI, 3.5%-

5.3%) of adult men in the United States
had diabetic retinopathy compared with
3.3% (95% CI, 2.7%-4.1%) of adult
women (P=.046). Non-Hispanic black
individuals and Mexican American in-
dividuals had a higher prevalence of dia-
betic retinopathy than non-Hispanic
white individuals (9.6%; 95% CI, 7.7%-
11.9%; 6.7%; 95% CI, 5.4%-8.4%; vs
2.9%; 95% CI, 2.2%-3.9%; both
P.001).
Prevalence of vision-threatening dia-
betic retinopathy was higher among
people aged 65 years or older than those
aged 40 to 64 years (1.0%; 95% CI,
0.7%-1.5%; vs 0.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-
0.7%; P=.009). There was no signifi-
cant difference in the prevalence of vi-
sion-threatening diabetic retinopathy
between men and women observed
(0.6%; 95% CI, 0.4%-0.9%; vs 0.6%;
95% CI, 0.4%-0.9%; P=.81). Approxi-
mately 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.6%) of
non-Hispanic white individuals, 2.3%
(95% CI, 1.5%-3.6%) of non-Hispanic
black individuals, and 1.4% (95% CI,
0.8%-2.7%) of Mexican American in-
dividuals had vision-threatening dia-
betic retinopathy (P.001).
Among individuals with diabetes,
those with diabetic retinopathy were
more likely to be men (53.7%; 95% CI,
47.4%-59.9%; vs 46.5%; 95% CI, 41.5%-
51.6%; P=.04) than those without dia-
betic retinopathy (TABLE 2). Diabetic
individuals with diabetic retinopathy
had a longer duration of diabetes (15.0
years; 95% CI, 13.4-16.5; vs 7.3 years;
95% CI, 6.5-8.1; P.001), higher sys-
tolic blood pressure (134.2 mm Hg;
95% CI, 131.6-136.9; vs 130.1 mm Hg;
95% CI, 127.9-132.4; P=.04), and
higher hemoglobin A1c
level (7.9%; 95%
CI, 7.6%-8.1%; vs 7.0%; 95% CI, 6.8%-
7.1%; P.001) than those without dia-
betic retinopathy. Diabetic individu-
als with diabetic retinopathy were more
likely to use insulin than those with dia-
betes but no diabetic retinopathy
(44.6%; 95% CI, 38.5%-50.9%; vs
10.2%; 95% CI, 8.1%-12.7%; P.001).
TABLE 3 shows the associations of
various risk factors with diabetic reti-
nopathy and vision-threatening dia-
betic retinopathy among individuals
with diabetes. In multivariate analysis,
independent risk factors for diabetic
retinopathy include male sex (38.1%;
95% CI, 32.6%-43.6%; vs 27.1%; 95%
CI, 22.4%-31.8%; OR, 2.07; 95% CI,
1.39-3.10), higher hemoglobin A1c
level (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20-1.75),
longer diabetes duration (OR, 1.06

threatening diabetic retinopathy. The
odds of vision-threatening diabetic
retinopathy were significantly higher
among non-Hispanic black individu-
als than in non-Hispanic white indi-
viduals, even after controlling for all
other factors considered (9.8%; 95%
CI, 5.7%-13.8%; vs 3.3%; 95% CI,
1.6%-5.0%; OR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.47-
9.69).
Additionally, we found that the age-
standardized prevalence of diabetic reti-
nopathy was statistically significantly
different between 2 periods (15.8%;
95% CI, 12.7%-19.6% in NHANES III
vs 22.1%; 95% CI, 18.4%-26.3% in
NHANES 2005-2008; P=.01). A statis-
tically significant difference of vision-
threatening diabetic retinopathy was
also observed; 1.3% (95% CI, 0.7%-
2.3%) had vision-threatening diabetic
retinopathy from the NHANES III data
and 3.3% (95% CI, 2.4%-4.4%) from
NHANES 2005-2008 (P=.002).
COMMENT
This study provides the latest nation-
ally representative estimates on the
prevalence and risk factors for dia-
betic retinopathy in the United States.
Earlier population-based studies
showed that almost all individuals with
type 1 diabetes and more than 60% of
those with type 2 diabetes develop dia-
betic retinopathy during the first 2 de-
cades of the disease.2 With the ex-
pected increased prevalence of type 2
diabetes in the population, due in part
to increasing rates of obesity and de-
creasing physical activity, the burden
of diabetic retinopathy might be ex-
pected to increase as well.33 However,
improved access to screening for and
treatment of diabetic retinopathy may
reduce the burden of diabetes-related
vision loss.
Our prevalence estimates are some-
what lower than those from a previ-
ous meta-analysis that compiled data
from 8 population-based studies of non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
and Hispanic people with diabetes from
the United States and elsewhere that re-
ported an overall estimate of preva-
lence of diabetic retinopathy of 40% and
a prevalence of vision-threatening dia-
betic retinopathy of 8%.13 However, the
studies that were included in the meta-
analysis were from regional cohorts,
many were from prior decades, and
most did not include individuals with
undiagnosed diabetes. If undiagnosed
diabetes were excluded from our
sample, our estimates for diabetic reti-
nopathy and vision-threatening dia-
betic retinopathy among self-reported
diagnosed diabetes would be 32.8%
(95% CI, 28.6-37.2) and 5.2% (95% CI,
4.0-6.7), respectively.
It is also possible that the lower
prevalence reported in this study re-
flects a true reduction in the preva-
lence of diabetic retinopathy. Rates of
other diabetic complications have de-
clined during recent decades. For ex-
ample, Geiss et al34 found that hospi-
talization rate for lower extremity
amputations among individuals with
diabetes began decreasing in 1997. An-
other recent study found that age-
adjusted diabetes-related end-stage re-
nal disease decreased between 1996 and
2006.35 Improved diabetes care, such as
effective management of blood glu-
cose levels, blood pressure, and serum
lipid levels, is likely to reduce the in-
cidence of diabetic retinopathy. Con-
versely, it might also lead to increased

survival resulting in higher preva-
lence of diabetic retinopathy. More-
over, a recent longitudinal cohort study
suggested that low vision and blind-
ness could be substantially reduced
among individuals with diagnosed
diabetes who received guideline-
recommended levels of care.36
We found that the age-standardized
prevalences of diabetic retinopathy and
vision-threatening diabetic retinopa-
thy were statistically significantly dif-
ferent between NHANES III and
NHANES 2005-2008. These differ-
ences between surveys may be real or
may be attributed to improved meth-
ods used to photograph the fundus in
the more recent NHANES 2005-2008
compared with NHANES III. Two digi-
tal 45° color images of both eyes were
taken in the NHANES 2005-2008 while
in NHANES III only one 45° color film
image from 1 eye was taken. Although
some studies have shown grading of
digital images to have similar sensitiv-
ity for detecting diabetic retinopathy as
grading of film images, it is possible that
the current method led to increased de-
tection of both diabetic retinopathy and
vision-threatening diabetic retinopa-
thy because of more retina being as-
sessed in 2 images compared with 1 and
higher-quality digital images com-
pared with earlier film images used in
NHANES III, thus limiting our ability
to directly compare results from
NHANES III and current NHANES
2005-2008 study (R.K., unpublished
data, 2009).
A previous analysis of NHANES III
data by Harris et al12 suggests that the
prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was
46% higher in non-Hispanic black
individuals and 84% higher in Mexi-
can American individuals than in
non-Hispanic white individuals.
Although not statistically significant
at a .05 level, we also found that
among individuals with diabetes, non-
Hispanic black individuals (47%
higher) and Mexican American indi-
viduals (29% higher) had a higher
crude prevalence of diabetic retinopa-
thy than their non-Hispanic white
counterparts. Moreover, the preva-
lence of vision-threatening diabetic
retinopathy in individuals with diabe-
tes was 190% higher in non-Hispanic
black individuals and 130% higher in
Mexican American individuals than in
non-Hispanic white individuals. This
may be due to individuals of non-
Hispanic black and Mexican Ameri-
can heritage being more likely to have
poorer glycemic control and being
less likely to be screened and treated
for diabetic retinopathy.37 Data from
National Health Interview Survey also
suggest that non-Hispanic black indi-
viduals and Hispanics are less likely to
use eye care services.38 These findings
lend further insight to inform national
efforts to reduce disparities in care
among racial/ethnic and socioeco-
nomic groups and preserve sight for
all adults in the United States.
Consistent with previous research,
we found that higher levels of hemo-
globin A1c
, longer duration of diabe-
tes, insulin use, and higher systolic
blood pressure were independently
associated with diabetic retinopathy
in the NHANES data.29,39-41 This is

consistent with findings from ran-
domized controlled clinical trials that
showed that modifying identified risk
factors such as glycemic control and
blood pressure control could reduce
the burden of diabetic retinopathy
and also prevent vision loss caused by
it.7,8 Prevention efforts may also need
to target individuals with longer dura-
tion of diabetes and those using insu-
lin. The new availability of care for
vulnerable sections of the population
should have demonstrable effect on
risk of blindness in diabetes. Further-
more, primary prevention of diabetes,
including identifying and protecting
individuals at risk (ie, by reduced
body weight and increased physical
activity), may also help delay the
onset of type 2 diabetes and reduce
complications of diabetic retinopathy.
We also found an inverse relationship
between diastolic blood pressure and
the presence of diabetic retinopathy.
The underlying reason remains unex-
plained and requires further explora-
tion. It could be due to selective par-
ticipation bias. However, previous
studies from Singapore42 and Africa43
also suggested a possible association
between pulse pressure (difference
between systolic and diastolic blood
pressure) and diabetic retinopathy.
The strengths of this study include
its population-based national sample,
its inclusion of individuals with undi-
agnosed diabetes, and improved
detection of retinopathy due to use of
digital fundus images of both eyes.
This improved methodology results in
estimates that are less biased than
those obtained from NHANES III.
However, individuals without diabe-
tes may have retinopathy because of
higher glucose level or hypertension,
which is not assessed in the current
study. Also, due to the infrequency of
proliferative diabetic retinopathy
(n = 23) and clinically significant
macular edema (n = 37), we were
unable to provide meaningful esti-
mates by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Our study is subject to several limi-
tations. First, individuals who were in-
stitutionalized (eg, nursing home resi-
dents) were not included in the
NHANES, which may have led to an un-
derestimate of diabetic retinopathy
prevalence. Second, we could not dis-
tinguish between type 1 and type 2 dia-
betes and the specific risk of diabetic
retinopathy complications. Third, there
were substantial numbers of eligible in-
dividuals with diabetes who did not
have photographs that could be graded,
which may negatively bias estimates of
diabetic retinopathy prevalence. Sur-
vey participants who had no light per-
ception or severe visual impairment in
both eyes, or a severe infection in 1 or
both eyes were excluded--this might
negatively bias the prevalence esti-
mates. Small sample sizes might have
prevented us from detecting differ-
ences, if they existed, between and
among subgroups. Due to limitations
inherent with the NHANES sampling
frame, we were unable to estimate the
prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and
vision-threatening diabetic retinopa-
thy among racial/ethnic groups other
than non-Hispanic white individuals,
non-Hispanic black individuals, and
Mexican American individuals.

the need for eye care and for culturally
appropriate interventions that can
reduce disparity and improve access to
eye care among diverse populations is
also likely to increase.
