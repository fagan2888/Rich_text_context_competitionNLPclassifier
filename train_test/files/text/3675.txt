Introduction
Treatment fidelity is defined as "the ongoing assessment,
monitoring, and enhancement of the reliability and internal
validity of a study" (Borrelli, 2011, p.1). Adherence to and
reporting of treatment fidelity may seem like obvious tasks
in any study, yet they are rarely published in relation to spe-
cific behavioral intervention trials (Resnick et al., 2005). The
lack of assurance that a study has been conducted according
to protocol opens up the door to error when new studies build
upon previous outcomes. Monitoring and reporting treat-
ment fidelity assure scientific transparency in a way that
facilitates reproducibility, as it both reports on and appraises
study process methods. In addition, treatment fidelity mea-
sures can be used to facilitate theoretical testing, to provide
an outline for research dissemination in clinical practice, and
to reduce random and unintended variability (Bellg et al.,
2004).The 2004 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Behavior
Change Consortium recommends five areas of treatment
fidelity best practices: study design, training, treatment

Abstract
Treatment fidelity is associated with improvement in research outcomes and increased confidence in significant findings.
However, few studies report on recommended areas of treatment fidelity (i.e., study design, training, treatment delivery,
treatment receipt, and treatment enactment), leaving a dearth of information about implementation components that
contributed to a study's success. Without such information, it is difficult for researchers to correctly assess previous findings
and for practitioners to correctly implement findings into practice. Thus, it is crucial that studies assess both treatment fidelity
and applicability of treatment fidelity findings. We report measures of treatment fidelity in a randomized controlled trial of
an intervention promoting colonoscopy in at-risk relatives of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We describe assessments
related to both treatment delivery and treatment receipt. We conducted separate ANCOVAs to model the change in each
of the treatment receipt variables, comparing the two intervention arms. Compared with the control group, the intervention
group had significantly greater improvements in CRC knowledge (f = 17.46, p < .0001), perceptions about susceptibility (f =
15.08, p = .0002), response efficacy (f = 7.46, p = .0076), self-efficacy (f = 8.16, p = .0053), and reduced decisional uncertainty
(f = 19.59, p < .0001) from baseline to 1-month follow-up. Overall, our study adhered to most of the best-practice guidelines
for behavioral intervention fidelity. This demonstrates that our intervention was delivered as intended and positively affected
the cognitive processes that are purported to be predictive of adherent behavioral outcomes.

delivery, treatment receipt, and treatment enactment (Bellg
et al., 2004).
In an analysis of 342 behavior change studies, Resnick et
al. (2005) found that only 15.5% of studies met the NIH
Behavior Change Consortium's standards for high treatment
fidelity reporting. Such low numbers indicate a dearth of
important information about the processes by which behav-
ioral science research is being conducted. More recently, the
2004 treatment fidelity recommendations have been
expanded, providing specific criteria for treatment fidelity
assessment in each of the five fidelity categories (Borrelli,
2011). In general, studies with higher treatment fidelity
(according to the checklist of the 25 treatment fidelity attri-
butes) were more likely to demonstrate significant results
than studies with low treatment fidelity (Resnick et al.,
2005). These findings highlight important considerations for
those interested in optimizing intervention research.
Yet, the importance of treatment fidelity to future research
has been contested by some researchers who argue that
strong adherence to fidelity measures presents potentially
important limitations both to the study implementing these
procedures and to future research dissemination. In an article
responding to Bellg et al. (2004), Leventhal and Friedman
(2004) presented concerns that treatment fidelity may impede
personalized medicine; if providers must adhere to rigorous
guidelines, it may inhibit their ability to provide individual-
ized care where a situation requires it.
Leventhal and Friedman (2004) also questioned the valid-
ity of treatment receipt, asserting that true comprehension of
a concept may be a more complex process than the ability to
regurgitate knowledge. Furthermore, they argue that under-
standing may not be necessary in facilitating behavior
change. Finally, they expressed concerns that the idea of
treatment enactment may be indistinguishable from treat-
ment adherence (or study outcome). Leventhal and Friedman
(2004) contested that this concept of enactment is highly
dependent on the kind of study being conducted, and may not
be measurable under all circumstances. If an intervention
does not involve participants learning a set of measurable
skills, it may not be practical to attempt to assess for
enactment.
In addition, Leventhal and Friedman (2004) and others
(Cohen et al., 2008; Hawe, Shiell, & Riley, 2008) have
argued that treatment fidelity, while potentially useful in pro-
viding confidence in outcome efficacy, may actually impede
flexibility when translated into clinical practice or when
implemented in future studies where conditions may differ in
both the populations being targeted and the resources avail-
able. They question the value of treatment fidelity against the
reality of adaptation in real-world settings. Hawe et al.
(2008) echoed this concern in their response to Spillane et
al.'s (2007) report of treatment fidelity in a randomized con-
trolled trial on heart disease prevention, noting that interven-
tions that are tailored to context may be more effective than
studies intent on direct translation according to fidelity
measures. Cohen et al. (2008) found that changes to inter-
ventions when translated into practice settings are both com-
mon and, often, unanticipated.
These critiques present important considerations to exam-
ine for those who wish to implement treatment fidelity best
practices in their study interventions. Critical assessment and
evaluation of treatment fidelity measures increase confi-
dence that Type I or Type II errors did not occur, thereby
providing assurance that unplanned effects of protocol devi-
ations do not lead to acceptance or rejection of study hypoth-
eses. However, research that identifies treatment fidelity
must also be willing to discuss how to incorporate elements
of successful studies into practical, real-world scenarios, to
allow for tailored implementation.
This article aims to address both the identified benefits
and the potential limitations to treatment fidelity reporting
by examining treatment fidelity in the context of the Family
Colorectal Cancer Awareness and Risk Education (Family
CARE) Project, a randomized controlled trial of an innova-
tive telehealth intervention that aimed to improve colonos-
copy uptake in individuals considered to be at intermediate
risk of familial colorectal cancer (CRC). Specifically, we
examined and evaluated treatment fidelity as defined accord-
ing to the five best-practice areas (Bellg et al., 2004, Borrelli
et al., 2005). We also identified and assessed potential limita-
tions to existing treatment fidelity measures, and discuss the
translatability of our intervention to future research and clin-
ical practice.
Method
Study Design and Participants
Family CARE was a randomized controlled trial investigat-
ing whether a personalized, remote, theoretically based risk-
assessment, and counseling intervention was more effective
than a mailed, low-intensity targeted print message delivered
to individuals who are considered at intermediate familial
risk for CRC. Research staff conducted a three-tiered recruit-
ment process: (a) identifying CRC patients through popula-
tion-based cancer registries, (b) contacting these patients to
request information about their at-risk relatives, and (c) con-
tacting identified relatives (Simmons et al., 2013). At-risk
family members who enrolled in the study were randomized
by family unit to either the tailored intervention group
(TeleCARE) or the minimal intervention group (PRINT). A
detailed description of the study methods and outcome is
provided elsewhere (Kinney et al., 2014; Pengchit et al.,
2011; Simmons et al., 2013). In all, 481 eligible intermedi-
ate-risk family members of CRC patients, representing 337
families, were enrolled and randomized between September
2009 and August 2011. The Institutional Review Boards of
participating institutions approved all study procedures.

ment through 1-month post-intervention evaluation.

We assessed treatment fidelity using the checklist created
by the NIH Behavior Change Consortium (Bellg et al., 2004)
and expanded by Borrelli (2011). Figure 2 outlines the
absence or presence of best practices in the Family CARE
study. Items that could not be implemented, due to study
design, are noted. After outlining these best practices and
their implementation, we evaluated fidelity measures of
treatment delivery and treatment receipt.
Treatment Fidelity Adherence Step 1: Study
Design
Theoretical models. We primarily used the Extended Parallel
Process Model (EPPM) to guide the TeleCARE intervention
(Pengchit et al., 2011; Witte, 1992). The EPPM postulates
that effective risk communication is optimal if individuals
believe that the threat of a disease or health condition is per-
sonally relevant (perceived susceptibility) and serious (per-
ceived severity), that the recommended action will help
mitigate their risk (response efficacy), and that they have the
tools necessary to execute the risk-mitigating action (self-
efficacy; Witte & Allen, 2000).
We used a motivational interviewing (MI) style of coun-
seling for the TeleCARE telephone counseling facet of the
intervention. MI is a directive counseling technique tradi-
tionally used when patient ambivalence is a barrier to posi-
tive action (Miller & Rollnick, 2009). Counselors use
questions and statements to strategically build rapport, elicit
talk in support of change, and collaborate with the patient on
a plan. Detailed explanation of the theoretical components as
well as the steps of the TeleCARE intervention is provided
elsewhere (Pengchit et al., 2011).
Pilot testing. We conducted pilot testing prior to implement-
ing the Family CARE study. Pilot testing took place at the
Huntsman Cancer Institute in January and February 2009,
with 35 CRC patients and their adult family members.
Piloted intervention materials included all recruitment letters
and brochures, the educational pamphlet intended for the
PRINT arm, and the baseline questionnaire and cover letter.
We revised study materials according to pilot participant
suggestions.

average of 39 min (SD = 12.2). We examined the primary
outcome of the study (colonoscopy uptake by 9 months) in
the 9-month follow-up questionnaire. We also examined
intermediate study endpoints, including participant experi-
ences and knowledge, sooner than at the 9-month follow-up.
Thus, our study protocol included contacting participants
from both arms at baseline, 1 month, 9 months, and 15
months post-intervention.
Protocol monitoring. The TeleCARE sessions were audiotaped
to assure fidelity and provide feedback to counselors. Prior
to the intervention, counselors obtained permission from par-
ticipants to record the session. During the session, each
genetic counselor used a protocol checklist (referred to here-
after as the Family CARE checklist), to assure that all steps
of the intervention were completed. Two study staff mem-
bers randomly selected intervention audiotapes for review
and individually completed the Family CARE checklist
while they listened to the audio recordings. After reviewing
each tape, the two staff members compared checklists and
outcomes, and they discussed protocol deviations in weekly
review meetings with the counselors.
Plan for implementation setbacks.We kept training minutes,
materials, and the standardized counseling protocol and ped-
igrees, in the event that new counselors needed to be trained.
Treatment Fidelity Adherence Step 2: Training
Interventionists
Selection of interventionists. The study utilized genetic coun-
selors, rather than other health care providers, to deliver the
intervention. Genetic counselors have specific expertise in
explaining genetic information to lay populations, and as
part of this study received theoretical training in behavioral
change mechanisms, and extensive experience tailoring can-
cer screening messages based on known risk and psychoso-
cial factors.
Standardized training. Prior to the intervention start date, each
counselor received the Family CARE intervention manual,
which outlined specific aspects of EPPM and MI and
included a step-by-step overview of each component of the
telephone intervention.
In addition, all counselors received 16 hr of in-person MI
training from an experienced MI trainer (S.W.), who trained
them as a group to ensure that they all received the same
information. All counselors were provided with a manual
that explained the theory and mechanisms of MI, as well as
examples of MI practice. MI training incorporated lecture,
video, demonstration, and practice, to effectively accommo-
date all learning styles.
Practice and feedback. The counselors practiced the interven-
tion on four analogue participants before conducting an
intervention on actual study participants. Practice partici-
pants included other genetic counselors and individuals who
agreed to provide feedback. The MI trainer reviewed the
practice sessions, using the evaluation procedures provided
below, to assure counselor proficiency prior to delivering the
actual intervention.
Intervention fidelity. All counselors participated in review ses-
sions, which assessed compliance with both the theoretical
models and the study protocol. During the review sessions,
the MI trainer reviewed a taped TeleCARE session to assess
for MI skill proficiency and address potential problems.
Each session was coded prior to the review, using the Family
CARE checklist, to assess for adherence to the theoretical
tenets and key clinical aspects of the intervention. After the
MI section of the review, adherence to these items was dis-
cussed and any potential problems concerning adherence or
the protocol were addressed.
To assure that counselors were proficient in performing
the study and to address any problems that arose in the initial
intervention implementation, review sessions took place
weeklyforthefirst3monthsoftheintervention.Subsequently,
review sessions were held biweekly for approximately 6
months. Toward the end of the intervention, when counselor
proficiency was high, biweekly meetings were conducted to
assess adherence to the study protocol, and monthly meet-
ings were conducted to assess MI performance.
Enhance interventionist involvement. Three of the five counsel-
ors participated in the study design. This helped ensure that
the clinician interventionists both understood and endorsed
the purpose and methods of the study prior to
implementation.
Treatment Fidelity Adherence Step 3: Treatment
Delivery
Create collaborative relationships with interventionists. As noted
previously, genetic counselors played an important role in
study design and implementation. The weekly review ses-
sions provided the opportunity for them to discuss challeng-
ing situations. These discussions assured early resolution of
specific concerns or problems with the intervention.
Use a scripted curriculum or treatment manual.As Borrelli
(2011) noted, the use of scripted treatment manuals for inter-
vention delivery is controversial. A scripted manual helps
reduce differences between interventionists, but may also con-
strain a tailored intervention. Furthermore, the use of a treat-
ment script may be ill suited to MI, which relies heavily on the
interventionist/patient discourse to accomplish behavioral
change (Miller & Rollnick, 2009). As a scripted intervention
did not match the tailoring and MI-style aims of our study, we
opted instead for the Family CARE manual and a checklist as
guidelines. The checklist assured that interventionists covered
6 SAGE Open
all required theoretical areas, but were allowed some flexi-
bility in delivery.
Assess nonspecific effects on an ongoing basis. At the 1-month
follow-up survey, participants were asked whether they
remembered the counseling session and/or printed materials.
They also reported on whether they found the information
useful, interesting, valuable, understandable, true, personal-
ized, and acceptable. Finally, participants were asked about
their emotional reactions to the intervention. The response
format for these items was on a 7-point Likert-type scale
where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree.
Minimize differences within treatments and maximize differences
between treatments. Independent coders assessed counselor
adherence to the Family CARE checklist and provided regu-
larly scheduled feedback sessions.
Ensure adherence to the protocol. We used the Family CARE
checklist and two measures of MI--the Motivational Inter-
viewing Treatment Integrity assessment (MITI; Moyers,
Martin, Manuel, Hendrickson, & Miller, 2005) and the
Behavior Change Counseling Index (BECCI; Lane, 2002)--
to evaluate adherence to the theoretical protocol. Two
researchers (W.B. and R.S.) were trained to use the MITI, a
behavioral coding system designed to be used as a treatment
integrity measure for MI intervention trials. The MITI evalu-
ates global characteristics of the interview (e.g., evocation,
collaboration, autonomy-supportiveness), as well as specific
counselor behaviors (e.g., giving information, asking ques-
tions, reflecting, confronting) that are consistent/inconsistent
with MI. The advantage of the MITI over simple clinical
impression is that the MITI provides objective feedback and
specific benchmarks on key aspects of MI. Several interven-
tion trials have used a similar system for quality control pur-
poses (Bennett, Roberts, Vaughan, Gibbins, & Rouse, 2007;
Carroll et al., 2006; Feldstein & Forcehimes, 2007; Moyers,
Martin, Manuel, Miller, & Ernst, 2010; Pierson et al., 2007;
Thyrian et al., 2007). Studies tend to find a substantial agree-
ment between patient and observer ratings of MI skill, as
well as prediction of improved participant outcomes based
on certain aspects of MITI-related performance. Coders also
received training on the BECCI, a short measure of brief MI
meant to be used in clinical health care settings. The BECCI
consists of 11 items which are scored in a Likert-type style
and which provide a total score ranging from 0 to 44 (Lane,
2002). We used both the MITI and the BECCI to assess
whether the two coding methods provided similar informa-
tion about counselor proficiency.
We assessed inter-rater reliability between coders for both
the Family CARE checklist and the BECCI using Shrout­
Fleiss calculations of inter-class correlation coefficients
(ICCs). This calculation is most appropriate when the same
raters are assumed to comprise the entire rater population,
and thus rate all subjects (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979). For the
BECCI, we established internal consistency reliability esti-
mates by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Variables used to
assess proficiency in the MITI included: MI Spirit score
(average of Evocation, Collaboration, and Autonomy/
Support), ratio of complex to simple reflections, ratio of
open to closed questions, and ratio of reflections to ques-
tions. Our assessment of inter-rater agreement for these MITI
items used guidelines to create categories of agreement,
including (a) not reaching proficiency, (b) beginning to reach
proficiency, and (c) meeting competency.
Establish minimum competency levels, below which intervention-
ists are given remedial training.If coders noticed consistent
problems with an area on the Family CARE checklist, they
brought up the item for discussion during intervention review
meetings. Reasons for the inclusion of the item (or use of the
item in order) were reviewed and strategies for improving
adherence were discussed. In general, protocol deviations
were rare.
To establish MI fidelity, we used competency thresholds
as presented in the MITI manual (Moyers et al., 2010).
Counselors were expected to meet minimum competency
ratings on the MITI global indicators and percent MI adher-
ent statements. This ensured that the overall tone of the inter-
vention was consistent with MI. Because of the structured
nature of the intervention and the inclusion of a substantial
amount of history-taking questions, counselors did not
always meet the threshold for behavior counts. In these
cases, the MI trainer determined counselor proficiency.
Treatment Fidelity Adherence Step 4: Treatment
Receipt
Ask participants whether they received the intervention materials
and telephone counseling for those randomized to TeleC-
ARE.Participants were asked whether they remembered
receiving the counseling session and/or printed materials
(yes vs. no). They were also asked whether they read the
printed materials they received (yes vs. some/no).
Assess pre-and post-test client knowledge.To determine the
extent to which participants were familiar with information
about CRC, colonoscopy, and screening recommendations,
we examined six knowledge-assessment questions in both
baseline and follow-up questionnaires. The genetic counsel-
ors specifically covered all six questions during the TeleC-
ARE intervention. These items included the following: (a)
information regarding the severity of CRC in the United
States, (b) how family history increases risk of CRC, (c)
information about the effectiveness of early detection of CRC
in saving lives (two questions), (d) information about the
effectiveness of colonoscopy, and (e) information about dif-
ferent screening recommendations based on family history.
Cronbach's alpha was not calculated for knowledge, which is
generally reported as an index score rather than as a scale.
Simmons et al. 7
Administer pre-and post-tests of participant decisional uncer-
tainty. One aim of MI is to reduce participant ambivalence
about change. Congruent with this aim, we were interested in
determining whether the intervention reduced participant
decisional uncertainty regarding colonoscopy screening.
Decisional uncertainty measures personal perceptions of (a)
uncertainty in choosing options; (b) modifiable factors con-
tributing to uncertainty, such as feeling uninformed, unclear
about personal values, or unsupported in decision-making;
and (c) effective decision-making such as feeling that the
choice is informed, values-based, likely to be implemented,
and expressing satisfaction with personal choice (O'Connor).
We assessed this measure at the time of both baseline and
follow-up questionnaires. Cronbach's alpha was .77.
Administer pre-and post-tests of the Risk Behavior Diagnosis
(RBD) Scale. The RBD scale measures the components of the
EPPM model (i.e., perceived susceptibility to threat, per-
ceived severity of threat, perceived self-efficacy, and per-
ceived response efficacy) to determine whether an individual
is ready for change (i.e., high threat and high efficacy; Witte,
Cameron, McKeon, & Berkowitz, 1996). We were interested
in determining whether the intervention increased both threat
and efficacy perceptions. Each subscale was comprised of
four items. Cronbach's alphas ranged from .83 to .90.
Ensure that materials have appropriate health literacy and cul-
tural relevance.To assure appropriate health literacy in our
written materials, we submitted all brochures, pamphlets,
and intervention documents to the Huntsman Cancer Insti-
tute's Cancer Learning Center for readability testing using
the Flesch­Kincaid scale (Paasche-Orlow, Taylor, & Bran-
cati, 2003). The readability for all documents was set at a
seventh-grade level overall, with sections of each document
set at no higher than an eighth-grade level. We presented
numerical information, so that it would be easy for study par-
ticipants to comprehend. Our study also attempted to address
cultural relevance by incorporating photos of rural individu-
als (as our study area had large rural populations), and those
with different ages, ethnicities, and racial backgrounds. Use
of MI as a counseling technique helped assure respectful
consideration of cultural attitudes and beliefs.
Use multiple formats for information delivery (verbal, pictures,
written). The PRINT group received an illustrated brochure
that outlined the increased risk for family members of CRC
patients, provided age recommendations for colonoscopy,
gave information on how to obtain a colonoscopy, and pro-
vided prevention guidelines. The TeleCARE group received
a packet of printed visual aids that were used in tandem with
the telephonic counseling session. These materials included
the following: (a) a picture of the participant's family tree
(diagramming the history of CRC), (b) a graph showing the
difference between an average person's risk and the risk of
someone with a similar family history of CRC, (c) a table
outlining the stages of CRC diagnoses and their survival
rates, and (d) a step-by-step list of how to obtain a colonos-
copy. During the counseling session, the genetic counselor
referred to each of these items and explained them in the
context of the intervention.
Assure that clients understood the material covered in interven-
tion. After reviewing each printed document in the interven-
tion packet, genetic counselors ascertained whether the
participant understood the material covered. To ensure client
participation and clarity, the counselors used MI techniques,
which allowed them to integrate open questions such as
"What questions do you have about this information?" into
each session.Asking whether the participant had any remain-
ing questions was a final step on the Family CARE
checklist.
Plan for action.The fourth and final document of the inter-
vention packet requested that participants identify what date
they would begin the first step of obtaining a colonoscopy. In
accordance with the Family CARE checklist, counselors
helped participants to brainstorm about the first step(s) to
obtain a colonoscopy and (if appropriate) to set a specific
date for that first step (e.g., "within the next month" or "after
my daughter's wedding in July").
Assess participant confidence in applying the intervention.Dur-
ing the telephone session, counselors asked participants to
rate their confidence about being able to obtain a colonos-
copy on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being no confidence, 10 being
absolute certainty). After the participant provided a rating,
counselors elicited the participant's reasons for the selected
confidence score (e.g., "Ok, so you rated it as a 2 out of 10.
What are some reasons that you rated it as a 2 rather than a
1?"). This concept aligned with the MI principle of promot-
ing change talk.
Contact for follow-up.Immediately after the telephone ses-
sion, participants were mailed a tailored letter that included a
summary of the discussion and reiterated the participant's
risk of CRC, benefits of colonoscopy, and personalized
action plan, including the planned start date. This letter also
provided the study's toll-free number, in the event that the
participant needed more information on how to enact the
steps to obtaining a colonoscopy.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS, Cary,
North Carolina). To adjust for the randomized cluster design
of the study, random family effect was included in each ana-
lytic model. Two-sided p values .05 were considered
significant.
Change in knowledge scores.We were interested in whether
participant knowledge improved in the intervention arm
from baseline to the 1-month follow-up questionnaire. We
8 SAGE Open
examined the effect of the intervention on knowledge using
ANCOVA, adjusting for the participant's knowledge at
baseline.
Change in decisional uncertainty.
We were interested in
whether levels of decisional uncertainty were reduced from
the baseline to the 1-month follow-up questionnaire, and
whether there was a greater improvement in the TeleCARE
group, compared with the low-intensity PRINT group. We
estimated the effect of the intervention on decisional uncer-
tainty with the same methods as we used to assess change in
knowledge.
Change in RBD scale. We examined change in the four RBD
measures from baseline to 1-month follow-up between the
two intervention conditions. We conducted separate ANCO-
VAs for each RBD measure to model the change in subscale
scores.
Results
As shown in Table 1, the two intervention groups did not dif-
fer by baseline sociodemographic or clinical characteristics.
Treatment delivery
Family CARE checklist. A total of 103 (47%) of the TeleCARE
sessions were assessed for fidelity according to the Family
CARE checklist. Of the sessions, the majority (98.7%) were
fully compliant with the checklist. Of the sessions that did
not meet full compliance (n = 27), most (96%) were at >90%
compliance.
Thirty Family CARE checklists were double coded to
assess for inter-rater reliability. The ICC was .93, indicating
excellent inter-rater reliability. The two coders demonstrated
perfect agreement on 18 of the 30 coded sessions (60%). The
largest discrepancy between coders for one session was 5
points.
MI.Two coders (R.S. and W.B.) reviewed 24 of the same
tapes for the five counselors. Table 2 provides an overview
of MI outcomes according to categories created by. The two
coders agreed that counselors demonstrated proficiency in
MI Spirit, but modest proficiency in the other three areas of
MI. The structured nature of the MI sessions may account for
these areas of modest proficiency ratings.
BECCI. Two coders scored the BECCI for 30 telephone coun-
seling sessions. The average BECCI score was 40.5 (SD =
1.81, range = 36-44), indicating high proficiency in a clinical
assessment of MI. The ICC value for the BECCI was .47,
which indicates fair inter-rater reliability. It should be noted
that the highly structured nature of the intervention truncated
the variation in BECCI scores, resulting in a lowered ICC;
this was not necessarily due to low inter-rater agreement. To
address this concern, we used additional indicators of the
rater's level of agreement to determine whether the review-
ers came to the same clinical conclusion about counselor MI
competence. When considering wider ranges of BECCI
scores as indications of MI competence, the two reviewers
agreed that all counselors demonstrated excellent MI skills
(BECCI scores between 40 and 44) on 15 of 30 sessions
(50%), and good MI skills (BECCI scores > 38) 83% (25/30)
of the time.
Treatment receipt.Table 3 shows descriptive statistics and
ANCOVA results for all measures of treatment receipt,
including changes in knowledge scores, RBD subscale
scores, and decisional uncertainty scale scores from baseline
to the 1-month post-intervention assessment.
On average, knowledge scores increased in both interven-
tion groups; however, the TeleCARE group had a signifi-
cantly greater increase in knowledge. The vast majority of
participants perceived CRC as serious at baseline, and per-
ceptions about severity were unchanged in 67% of respon-
dents (f = 0.35, p = .56). Perceived susceptibility was virtually
unchanged in the PRINT group, but the TeleCARE group
had significantly higher scores following the intervention
(f = 15.08, p = .0002). Response efficacy scores increased for
both intervention groups, but the TeleCARE group had a sig-
nificantly greater increase (f = 7.46, p = .0076). Self-efficacy
scores also increased in both groups, but again, theTeleCARE
group demonstrated a significantly greater increase com-
pared with the PRINT group (f = 8.16, p = .0053). Decisional
uncertainty change scores decreased in both intervention
groups; however, the TeleCARE group showed a signifi-
cantly greater decrease in uncertainty regarding the decision
to have a colonoscopy (f = 19.59, p < .0001).
Discussion
In general, steps to assure treatment fidelity in the Family
CARE trial remained consistent with the recommendations
for best practices (Bellg et al., 2004; Borrelli, 2011; Borrelli
et al., 2005). In our study, best-practice recommendations
were adhered to with regard to study design and training of
interventionists. Assessment of treatment delivery indicated
that counselors were adherent to the TeleCARE interven-
tion's theoretical tenets.
Assessment of counselor proficiency in MI demonstrated
a more complex picture of the intervention delivery. Coders
ratings suggested that the genetic counselors demonstrated
high levels of MI Spirit (22/24 tapes indicated that counsel-
ors met competency), yet they also suggested that specific
measures of MI utterances (open questions, complex reflec-
tions, reflection-to-question ratios) demonstrated modest
proficiency. This seeming difference in proficiency may be
due to the fact that MI was incorporated into the intervention
more as a style of delivery and less as a specific counseling
tool. Traditional MI encourages clinicians to ask questions

commuting data to characterize census tracts and zip codes. The 10 RUCA categories were aggregated into urban (1-3) and rural (4-10) as recommended by the Washington,
Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) Rural Health Research Center. Logistic mixed model to account for familial correlation. Testing is for the association

that can lead to deeper discussion and reflection on the issue
at hand; whereas in the current intervention, genetic counsel-
ors were constrained by the requirement to address the theo-
retical tenets of the intervention, which required them to
provide a psycho-educational approach. This may have
inhibited proficiency counts based on utterance scores.
Previous studies (Miller & Rollnick, 2009) have demon-
strated that for studies that incorporate MI into structured,
multi-theoretical models, the use of traditional utterance
counts to examine counselor proficiency may not represent
the best method of assessment. For the more global MI
assessment scores (MI Spirit and the BECCI), coders agreed
that counselors were proficient in MI. These findings indi-
cate that future studies which incorporate MI into interven-
tion structures may find that global ratings of MI are better
indicators of counselor proficiency; or, conversely, that a
more detailed assessment such as the Motivational
Interviewing Skill Code, which assesses interventionist/ par-
ticipant interactions rather than interventionist utterances,
might provide better information about the level of MI
proficiency in such studies (Madson & Campbell, 2006;
Resnick et al., 2005).
Recommendations for assessing treatment fidelity include
administering pre-and post-tests of knowledge as part of
treatment receipt assessment (Borrelli, 2011). However, as
prior research has demonstrated that increases in knowledge
alone do not appreciably affect CRC screening behavior
(Manne et al., 2002), we included additional measures of
treatment receipt that aligned with our study's aims and theo-
retical rationale. All of these measures (e.g., decisional con-
flict, RBD subscale scores), with the exception of perceived
severity, were found to significantly improve at the 1-month
follow-up. These findings indicate that our TeleCARE inter-
vention was successful in addressing the theoretical targets.
Future plans include assessing whether these theoretical tar-
gets mediated the effect of the intervention on colonoscopy
uptake. Other cancer screening studies have also shown little
variation in perceived severity. This is likely due to a ceiling
effect, wherein individuals already perceive cancer as a seri-
ous disease and, consequently, scores do not change much
over time.
Our study has several limitations. The low number of par-
ticipants representing ethnic and racial minorities limits the
generalizability of our study's findings. We did not include
the treatment fidelity area of "treatment enactment" as sug-
gested in the recommendations for best practices for treat-
ment fidelity (Bellg et al., 2004; Borrelli, 2011). Treatment
enactment is a method of assessing whether the skills a par-
ticipant acquires from an intervention are appropriately
implemented, so as to assure intended study outcomes
(Borrelli, 2011). The difference between enactment and out-
comes is the measurement of enactment throughout the
course of the study, instead of at the end of the follow-up
period. In certain study designs, such as behavioral interven-
tion trials designed to motivate cancer screening or single-
event decision behaviors, it may not be practical to assess for
implementation of self-regulatory skills, as these skills may
not be measurable. In our study, the primary outcome was
colonoscopy uptake by 9 months after the intervention; skills
needed to carry out this task are difficult to measure sepa-
rately from the event itself. For example, steps to obtain a
colonoscopy include the following: (a) contacting a primary
care physician for a colonoscopy referral, (b) making an
appointment with the colonoscopy center, (c) obtaining a
prescription for and ingesting the preparation the night
before, and (d) finding someone to take the participant to and
from his or her appointment. Most of these steps are proce-
dural and do not require a particular skill set. In our case,
enactment essentially overlaps with outcome. Therefore, this
measure of fidelity may be design-dependent and not always
measurable. Future studies that assess treatment fidelity may
need to determine whether treatment enactment is possible
prior to study implementation. Studies that examine adher-
ence to treatment fidelity may also be advised to take study

Conclusion
Reporting treatment fidelity is an important yet widely unde-
rutilized process that both assures the legitimacy of study
outcomes and creates informed precedence for future
research. The Family CARE study adhered to most of the
best-practice guidelines outlined previously, demonstrating
that our intervention was delivered as intended and posi-
tively affected the cognitive processes that are thought to
predict desired behavioral outcomes. Given the complex
nature of behavioral interventions, we recommend the poten-
tial use of multiple treatment receipt assessments, to assure
that cognitive intervention targets are assessed. Finally, we
recommend that future treatment fidelity assessments con-
sider the appropriateness of including treatment enactment
as a required component of the treatment fidelity checklist,
as it may not substantially differ from study outcomes in
research areas, such as cancer
