Extramedical Use of Prescription Pain Relievers
by Youth Aged 12 to 21 Years in the United States
National Estimates by Age and by Year
Elizabeth A. Meier, PhD; Jonathan P. Troost, BS; James C. Anthony, PhD
Objective: To identify when youth are most likely to start
using prescription pain relievers to get high or for other
unapproved indications outside the boundaries of what a
prescribing physician might intend (ie, extramedical use).
Design: Cross-sectional surveys of adolescent cohorts,
2004 to 2008.
Setting: The United States.
Participants: Largenationallyrepresentativesamplesof
youth in the United States who had been assessed for the
2004through2008NationalSurveyonDrugUseandHealth,
yieldingdatafrom138 729participantsaged12to21years.
Main Outcome Measures: Estimated age-specific risk
of starting extramedical use of prescription pain relievers,
year by year, and confirmation of age at peak risk by tracing
the experience of individual cohorts during this period.
Results: The estimated peak risk of starting extramedi-
cal use of prescription pain relievers occurs in midado-
lescence, well before the college years. The age at peak
risk is 16 years, when an estimated 2% to 3% become
newly incident users. Smaller risk estimates are ob-
served at age 12 to 14 years and at age 19 to 21 years.
Conclusions: For initiatives to prevent youth from using
prescription pain relievers to get high or for other un-
approved indications, a focus on the last year of high
school and the post­secondary school years may be too
little too late. Practice-based approaches are needed in
addition to public health interventions based on effec-
tive alcohol and tobacco prevention programs during the
earlier adolescent years.

MOST PHYSICIANS, OTHER
clinicians who pre-
scribe (eg, dentists),
and public health pro-
fessionals know about
recent increasing trends of prescribing
pain relievers.1 Concurrent evidence
demonstrates increased use of these com-
pounds to get high or for other unap-
proved indications outside the boundar-
ies set by prescribing clinicians (ie,
extramedical use), including evidence of
first use in late childhood and early
adolescence.1-4 Rates of hazards, such as
overdose deaths, also have increased.1
Coverage of these topics in most me-
dia outlets, press releases, journal ar-
ticles, and government reports focuses at-
tention on high school seniors and youth
in the post­secondary school years. Nev-
ertheless, the risk of hazardous conse-
quences may be greatest when extramedi-
cal use of prescription pain relievers starts
during early adolescence.3-5
In the present study of recent experi-
ences among individuals aged 12 to 21
years in the United States, we sought to
identify when youth are most likely to start
using prescription pain relievers to get high
or for other unapproved indications. Based
on epidemiological estimates previously
published,6,7 we anticipated a peak risk late
in high school or soon thereafter but made
allowances for discovery of a peak risk in
earlier midadolescence.4,8,9
METHODS
Data are from the 2004 through 2008 National
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) pub-
lic use files. The NSDUH uses a cross-sectional
design to select a different nationally represen-
tative random sample of the US civilian nonin-
stitutionalized population each year. Partici-
pants in the NSDUH are 12 years or older and
are interviewed once in a cross-sectional man-
ner (ie, participants are never interviewed at a
later date, as might be true in a longitudinal

out of school and youth who attend school. Participation levels
tend to be acceptable, often at 70% or better during the years un-
der study after parental consent and adolescent assent were se-
cured.8 TheNSDUHparticipantscompletedastandardizedaudio-
enhancedcomputer-assistedself-interview(meanduration,about
60 minutes) at a private location within or near the home after
informed consent processes approved by institutional review
boards for protection of human participants.
One audio-enhanced computer-assisted self-interview mod-
ule asked about using prescription pain relievers for the "ex-
perience or feelings" they caused or if "not prescribed for you"
(ie, to get high or for other unapproved indications outside the
boundaries of what the prescribing clinician might intend). Spe-
cific NSDUH modules and items are available online (http://oas
.samhsa.gov/nsduh/methods.cfm). The eAppendix (http://www
.archpediatrics.com) lists the standardized survey items, question
prompts, and names of compounds covered.8
A total of 138 729 participants aged 12 to 21 years partici-
pated in the 2004 through 2008 NSDUH. The estimates herein
are based on 119 877 participants aged 12 to 21 years whose
self-report assessment indicated that they had never engaged
in extramedical use of prescription pain relievers before the year
in which they were assessed for the NSDUH; 18 852 partici-
pants (13.6%) did not contribute to the study estimates for in-
cidence of use because they had already initiated such use be-
fore the year in which they were surveyed. As of the date of
assessment, participants in the estimation sample were never
users (who were at risk of starting use in a later year) or were
newly incident users (who had just started to use). Stratum-
specific estimates of the cumulative incidence proportion can
be calculated as a ratio of the number of newly incident users
divided by the sum of the number of never users plus the num-
ber of newly incident users. With age as a marker of cohort mem-
bership, the result is a set of risk estimates, year by year and
age by age, which makes it possible to trace the experience of
individual cohorts over time without a repeated-measures sur-
vey design.10 For example, the youngest cohort sampled was
aged 12 years in 2004, aged 13 years in 2005, and aged 14 years
in 2006. The eTable gives unweighted numbers for each nu-
merator and denominator for each age and year cell. The eAp-
pendix describes in detail the approach used to identify newly
incident users, past-onset users, and never users.
Note that these are independently drawn nationally repre-
sentative samples, year by year. A new sampling process oc-
curs each year. As such, this project is not a longitudinal study
of specific individuals with successive assessments over time,
which might introduce sample attrition during the follow-up
period, as well as problems such as measurement reactivity.11
Instead, the resulting cumulative incidence proportions con-
vey the risk estimate of starting extramedical use of prescrip-
tion pain relievers based on the epidemiological record of a medi-
cal outcome combined with information about the denominators
at risk (such as Frost11 used in his classic epidemiological re-
search to estimate age-specific and cohort-specific risk of tu-
berculosis mortality on the basis of death certificate records).
A summary of other features of this research approach based
on survey data has been previously published.12
Statistical analysis and an estimation approach appropriate
for complex survey designs and sampling weights (represent-
ing an estimate of the total number in the target population)
used commercially available software (STATA, version 11; Stata-
Corp LP), with a subpopulation approach appropriate for the
stratification of newly incident users, past-onset users, and never
users.8 The meta-analysis summary estimates reported are not
simple means; they were calculated using a random-effects meta-
analysis software program (STATA, version 11) that weights
each year by the inverse of its variance. Standard errors for the
estimates are small because of the large NSDUH samples.
RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes the study sample. The main study
estimates are given in Table 2, including tracing of in-
dividual cohorts and age-specific patterns. For ex-
ample, an estimated 0.4% of participants aged 12 years
in 2004 started extramedical use of prescription pain re-
lievers. The population cohort of participants aged 12
years in 2004 was newly sampled in 2005, when the co-
hort passed their 13th birthdays. The risk estimate for
this new sample of participants, aged 13 years in 2005,
was 0.8%. Tracing the cohort diagonally in Table 2 to
2008, this cohort's risk estimate for starting extramedi-
cal use of prescription pain relievers at age 16 years is

2.5%, the largest observed value in that population co-
hort's series of estimates from 2004 through 2008.
The experience of participants aged 13 years in 2004
is similar, with a low risk estimate of 0.6% at age 13 years.
The next risk estimate of 1.4% for this cohort is seen in
2005, when the cohort passed their 14th birthdays. There-
after, the risk estimate increases to 2.0% at age 15 years
in 2006. The final risk estimates are 2.5% at age 16 years
in 2007 and 2.5% at age 17 years in 2008.
Theexperienceofthecohortaged16yearsin2004helps
to confirm that the peak risk occurs in midadolescence,
before most youth in the United States have reached their
senior year of high school. In 2004, an estimated 3.1% of
participants aged 16 years started extramedical use of pre-
scription pain relievers. Thereafter, the risk estimates for
the cohort are 2.4% at age 17 years in 2005 and 2.4% at
age 18 years in 2006, with subsequent drops to 2.1% at
age 19 years in 2007 and 1.3% at age 20 years in 2008.
When Table 2 is studied year by year (row by row),
the only year with a peak risk beyond age 17 years is 2008
(bottom row). For that exceptional year, the risk esti-
mates were 2.4% for participants aged 15 years and 2.5%
for participants aged 16 to 17 years. The peak risk of 2.7%
in 2008 at age 18 years was not appreciably different from
the 2.4% to 2.5% values.

(bottom row of Table 2). It stands out as the year with the

The Figure shows meta-analysis summary estimates
for age-specific risk of starting extramedical use of pre-
scription pain relievers. Shown are the peak risks in mid-
adolescence and the lower age-specific risk estimates at
age 12 to 14 years and at age 19 to 21 years, which are
based on all age-specific risk estimates given in Table 2,
integrated via a standard meta-analysis for indepen-
dently drawn study samples.
COMMENT
We suspect that many physicians, other prescribing cli-
nicians, and public health professionals will share our
surprise that for youth in the United States, the peak
risk of starting extramedical use of prescription pain
relievers generally occurs before the final year of high
school, not during the post­secondary school years.
Based on this study's estimates for each year between
2004 and 2008, roughly 1 in 60 youth aged 12 to 21
years starts extramedical use of prescription pain reliev-
ers. Nonetheless, the peak risk is concentrated at about
age 16 years, when roughly 1 in 30 to 40 youth starts
extramedical use (meta-analysis summary estimate,
2.8%). Lower risk estimates are found for age 12 to 14
years and for age 19 to 21 years, as seen in the Figure,
confirmed by tracing the experience of individual
cohorts across the survey years under study (ie, diago-
nally in Table 2).
Beforeanydetaileddiscussionorspeculationaboutthese
findings, several limitations must be acknowledged, in-
cludingtheself-reportcharacterofthenationalsamplesur-
vey data. Toxicological analysis remains beyond the scope
of large nationally representative community samples on
this scale, and it is unclear that any drug assay would elimi-
nate uncertainty about the age of starting extramedical use
of prescription pain relievers. For example, some users
would have positive urine screens due to legitimately pre-
scribed opioid use for approved indications (eg, pain re-
lief after wisdom tooth extraction).

As another potential error, some degree of survey non-
participation raises the possibility that youth with ex-
tramedical use of prescription pain relievers might not
be willing to participate in surveys of this type. None-
theless, we tried to constrain this source of error by fo-
cusing attention on youth who are just starting to use,
most of whom do not develop dependence problems or
become disengaged from their family or from society at
large within 12 to 24 months after the onset of such use.13
In addition, a counterbalanced strength is that this sur-
vey is not restricted to youth who attend school; its sample
is based on probability sampling of dwelling unit resi-
dents within each sampled community, as required for
national representation of all youth. Each survey's sam-
pling frame has included youth irrespective of whether
they maintain student status, have dropped out of school,
are employed in the labor force, or are unemployed.
Notwithstanding such limitations, the NSDUH esti-
mates seem strong relative to available alternatives, but in
theory useful comparative estimates might be extracted
from data gathered in surveys of youth who attend school.
For example, as many as 80% of youth aged 16 years in
the United States have not dropped out and continue to
attend secondary schools (NSDUH data not shown). As
an example of other estimates of this type, the US Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention conducts a Na-
tional Youth Risk Behavior Survey, with survey ques-
tions about pain relievers introduced for the first time in
2009. The agency reported that 26% of 12th graders and
15% of 9th graders in 2009 had ever taken a prescription
drug without a physician's prescription.14 However, the ob-
served major increase from 15% to 26% across these sec-
ondary school years cannot be ascribed specifically to pre-
scriptionpainrelieversbecausethesurvey'ssinglequestion
on this topic does not distinguish prescription pain re-
lievers from other prescribed psychoactive medicines, such
as alprazolam and methylphenidate.14
By comparison, the US Monitoring the Future study9
is more informative because it asked 8th, 10th, and 12th
graders about the use of narcotics other than heroin, with
an explicit list that named methadone hydrochloride, co-
deine, pantazocine lactate (Talwin), morphine sulfate,
opium, meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol), lauda-
num, and paregoric until 2002, when the list was ex-
panded to include other compounds such as oxycodone
(OxyContin), acetaminophen-hydrocodone (Vicodin), ac-
etaminophen­oxycodone hydrochloride (Percocet or Per-
codan), and hydromorphone hydrochloride (Dilaudid),
as well as (unlisted) narcotics other than heroin.
Using school survey data, we aimed to trace recent ex-
perience of individual cohorts for prescription pain re-
lievers (eg, comparing use by 8th graders in 2004 with
use by 10th graders in 2006 and with use by 12th grad-
ers in 2008), as was done in 1988 (when no correlation
with age was found)15 and in recently published work on
cannabis.16 However, we learned that the data for 8th and
10th graders and estimates on these compounds have not
been released in the survey publications; the only data
available to researchers outside the survey team are from
high school seniors. The survey team acknowledges po-
tential biases in their estimates on these topics, includ-
ing the fact that the data are retrospective from 12th grade
backward over time (and past onset of use might have
occurred as early as the 6th grade), in addition to biases
associated with absenteeism (estimated to be roughly 20%
on the days of survey completion) and school dropout
(estimated to be an additional 15%).9 Notwithstanding
such limitations, the published data based on retrospec-
tive reports of high school seniors seems to be congru-
ent with the evidence seen in the Figure and Table 2
herein. Specifically, in the school survey estimates from
2002 through 2009, the transition from 11th grade to 12th
grade is not a marker of the peak risk. Rather, evaluated
retrospectively over these years, more high school se-
niors had started to use narcotics other than heroin be-
tween 9th grade and 10th grade and between 10th grade
and 11th grade than had been true for the transition year
from 11th grade to 12th grade.9
Some prior national community sample reports,10 in-
cluding an important article4 based on participants aged
12 to 17 years in the 2005 NSDUH, hinted that an inci-
dence peak might exist in early midadolescence: 13.3 years
was the estimated mean age at onset of use for youth aged
12 to 17 years who had used pain relievers during the
year before NSDUH assessment.4 In contrast to research
on youth aged 12 to 17 years, for whom the latest pos-
sible age at onset is 17 years, the community sample for
our project included youth aged 18 to 21 years and youth
aged 12 to 17 years, allowing for later onset. Perhaps most
important, our project's focus was on newly incident ex-
tramedical users of prescription pain relievers (ie, youth
who had just started to use these compounds during the
year in which they were surveyed). When an analysis is
based on all persons with a lifetime history of drug use
or on all recently active users (eg, those with any use in
the year before the assessment), the resulting estimates
are based on the aggregate of experience across multiple
cohorts and years, including the experience of drug us-
ers who have been using for many years (and who may
not have a clear memory of the exact age at first use).
One advantage of focusing on newly incident users is a
constrained reliance on long-term memory about age at
onset many years ago. In this project, the elapsed time
from the initial use to the date of the interview was al-
ways constrained to be less than 12 months.
Consistent with our focus on newly incident use, we
excluded 13.6% of the NSDUH participants aged 12 to
21 years during 2004 to 2008 from our estimates of cu-
mulative incidence because they had engaged in extra-
medical use of prescription pain relievers during the years
before the year in which they were surveyed (and were
no longer considered at risk of newly incident use). This
excluded group of lifetime extramedical users of pre-
scription pain relievers represents roughly 1 in 7 of the
youth in this nationally representative sample (not in-
cluding newly incident users). While such lifetime use
estimates can be important indicators of the magnitude
of a problem, patterns of newly incident use more clearly
highlight when the most effective time might be to pre-
vent first use or to intervene during the earliest stages of
a drug dependence process.1-8,10,13,17-23
Appreciating that recent school survey data provide
modest external confirmation of this project's nation-
ally representative sample evidence, we draw attention

to the timing of potential prevention and intervention ap-
proaches given the observed peak risk during midado-
lescence and a rise and fall of risk estimates before and
after midadolescence. With the peak risk at age 16 years
and a notable acceleration in risk between ages 13 and
14 years, any strict focus on college students or 12th grad-
ers might be an example of too little too late in the clini-
cal practice sector and in public health work. There is
reason to strengthen earlier school-based prevention pro-
grams and early outreach along the lines of effective
school-based alcohol and tobacco public health initia-
tives. Even so, with as many as 15% of youth not attend-
ing school during the observed midadolescence peak risk,
there also is reason to design coordinated practice-
based efforts by pediatricians, dentists, and other pre-
scribing clinicians in the patient care and public health
sectors. Via coordination of school-based and practice-
based initiatives, it may be possible to reduce the risks
associated with youth starting to use prescription pain
relievers to get high or for other unapproved indica-
tions outside the boundaries of what a prescribing cli-
nician has intended. Of course, because an estimated 20%
to 40% of high school students say that narcotics other
than heroin are fairly easy or very easy to get,9,23 it is im-
portant to consider not only underuse and overuse of pre-
scription pain relievers but also mechanisms of diver-
sion as might be controlled in a manner that will reduce
associated public health hazards.
