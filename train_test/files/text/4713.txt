It has now been more than a decade since the correlates of
performance on the national licensing exam, the Examination
for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP) of clinical
psychology graduates was reported (Templer & Tomeo,
1998b; Yu et al., 1997). In that research with 45 professional
school (Vail Model) programs and 83 traditional (Boulder
Model) programs, EPPP scores correlated .78 with 1988-
1995 median Verbal + Quantitative + Analytical Graduate
Record Examination (GRE) scores, .65 with minimum
Verbal + Quantitative + Analytical GRE, .56 with American
Psychological Association approval, -.49 with ratio of full-
time students to core faculty, -.46 with number of doctorates
awarded, .46 with minimum Analytical GRE, and -.44 with
number of full-time students enrolled. The findings that were
most controversial and most professionally relevant involved
the high EPPP scores of the traditional program graduates,
which were especially obvious at both ends of the distribu-
tion. The top of the distribution was dominated by traditional
programs and the bottom of the distribution was dominated
by professional programs. The traditional programs were
superior not only on the EPPP total score and the Research
subtests but also on the Diagnostic, Intervention, and
Professional/Ethics subtests (Templer & Tomeo, 2000).
Subsequent research demonstrated that a salient difference
still existed for EPPP scores 1997-2005 (Templer, Stroup,
Mancuso, & Tangen, 2008).
The findings are especially noteworthy to professional
schools because they purport to produce a superior profes-
sional product. Independent professional practice is not
possible without passing the EPPP. Unfortunately for the
image of professional schools, their graduates tend not to
do well on other indicators of professional functioning.
They are less likely to be a diplomate in the American
Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP), less likely to be
president of state psychological associations, and less likely
to be directors of theAssociation of Psychology Postdoctoral
and Internship Centers (APPIC; Templer et al., 2000). The
generally less satisfactory performance of professional
school graduates has led to the inference that there are two
tiers of clinical training in the United States (Templer,
2005b).
The present study went beyond the previous EPPP
research comparing professional (Vail Model) and traditional
(Boulder Model) clinical psychology graduates in two ways.
(a) The Educational and Reporting Service had reported
mean EPPP scores of programs and such was used in the
previous research. The Educational and Reporting Service
currently provides number and percentage of exams taken
and passed for each program. Kenkel, DeLeon, Albino, and
Porter (2003) suggested that pass rate may be more impor-
tant than mean score. This appears to be a reasonable

Examination for Professional Practice
in Psychology: High Failure Rate on
Licensing Exams Taken by Professional
School Graduates
Donald I. Templer1 and Kimberly Tangen2
Abstract
Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP) taken by professional (Vail Model) graduates had a failure rate of
30.82% in contrast to 7.60% for EPPP licensing exams taken by traditional (Boulder Model) graduates of clinical psychology
programs. Thus, exams taken by professional graduates were 4.06 more likely to result in failure. It was acknowledged that it
is not known whether EPPP performance is related to psychotherapy outcome.

perspective. The psychologist with a perfect EPPP score
receives the same license as the one who barely passes.
(b) The previous research on the EPPP compared mean
scores of professional and traditional graduates has actually
attenuated the true differences because professional school
means are based on a much larger N. The larger N is a func-
tion of both professional schools graduating more students
per program and because of having to take the EPPP again.
In the present study, we not only report pass/fail mean pro-
gram rates but also consider the number of exam taken and
passed/failed by the composite of professional programs and
traditional programs.
Method
The EPPP pass rate information was obtained from the
Association of State and Professional Provincial Boards
(ASPPB; 2010) for 2005-2009 for 217 clinical psychology
programs: 154 traditional programs (140 American and 14
Canadian) and 63 professional (all American) programs.
ASPPB only included programs that had three or more exams.
An additional caveat is that pass is based on a score of 500,
which is the passing score of the preponderance of states and
provinces. If one wishes to determine the exact pass rate of a
jurisdiction, one should communicate with that jurisdiction. It
should be borne in mind that N pertains to number of exams
taken and not necessarily the number of different graduates
having taken the exam. That is, the number of exams taken
includes an unknown number of retakes. The Alliant/
California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP)­
Berkeley 11 exams were combined with the 268 Alliant/
CSPP-Alameda graduates because there was a change in
location but not program. Only straight clinical psychology
programs were included. Clinical-neuropsychology, clinical-
health, clinical-ethnic minority, clinical-family child, clinical
psychodynamic, combined clinical/counseling/school, clinical-
community, child-clinical, clinical school, combined profes-
sional scientific, clinical psychology-health and medical,
clinical psychology-law, physiological-developmental clini-
cal, and adult-clinical were excluded. There were 31 pro-
grams excluded due to being combined with other areas in
contrast to 217 solely clinical programs whose data were
analyzed. It should be further noted that the American
Psychological Association accredits not only clinical psy-
chology programs but also counseling and school programs.
The latter two categories were not used because virtually all
of the professional schools have clinical psychology pro-
grams, although some may have counseling and school
elements.
Results
The readers should bear I mind that the past pass/failure rates
pertain to the exams taken and not number of graduates. It is
not known whether a failure is for the 1st time the graduate
took the test or the 20th time. It is conceivable that a small
percentage of professional graduates experience multiple
failures but the overwhelming preponderance of professional
graduates pass the EPPP on the first attempt.
Table 1 contains the number of exams taken and pass rates
for the 63 professional (Vail Model) and 154 traditional
(Boulder Model) programs. Tied programs are listed in
alphabetical order. Professional programs have a "P" in front
of them and are capitalized. Traditional programs have a "T"
in front of them.
Nine (14.30%) of the 63 professional programs and 128
(83.02%) of the 154 traditional programs had mean pass
rates higher than the overall mean pass rate of 86.97%, 2(1,
N = 217) = 163.42, p < .001. The 63 professional schools had
a mean pass rate of 73.41% (SD = 14.02) and the traditional
programs had a mean pass rate of 92.77 (SD = 8.49), t(df =
84.77) = 10.35, p < .001. As stated above, however, such
analyses mask the true differences between professional and
traditional clinical psychology programs because most pro-
fessional schools have many more EPPP exams taken and
because these data include retakes. In the present study, in
one state, there were six professional programs that each had
more than 200 exams taken for a total of 1,775 exams, and
690 exams failed. This is over twice that of the 154 tradi-
tional programs combined.
Of the 3,447 EPPP exams taken by traditional clinical
psychology graduates, 3,185 (92.20%) were passed and of
the 7,202 exams taken by professional clinical psychology
graduates, 4,946 (69.20%) were passed, 2(1, df = 10,647) =
5,321.53, p < .001. Failure rate on the EPPP of 30.82% was
4.06 greater than that of the traditional graduates' failure rate
of 7.60%.
Discussion
The vastly superior quality of the students of the traditional
programs must certainly contribute to the higher EPPP pass
rate of the traditional programs. Traditional programs accept
10% and professional schools 44% of applicants (Templer,
2005a, 2005b; Templer & Bedi, 2003). The mean grade point
average of traditional programs is two standard deviations
higher (Templer, 2005b). Their mean GRE scores are more
than two standard deviations higher (Templer & Arikawa,
2004). The GRE difference may be especially important
because it correlated substantially with Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-Revised IQ (Carvajal & Pauls, 1995).
This is especially unfortunate in view of the current demand
for evidence-based assessment and treatment (e.g., Levant,
2004). Less talented people are less capable of examining
scientific evidence.
It should be noted that not all professional schools have
high failure rates. Five professional programs have a pass
rate of more than 95%. For example, the Rutgers profes-
sional program mean pass rate of 95.80% is almost identical
to that of the Rutgers traditional program rate of 95.50%. The

Rutgers professional school mean pass rate of 95.80% is
almost identical to that of the Rutgers traditional program
rate of 95.50%. The Rutgers professional program accep-
tance rate of 6% compares most favorably with the general
professional school rate of 44% and is even lower than the
traditional acceptance rate of 10%. Templer and Tomeo
(1998a) warned Canadian psychologists, "Don't let it happen
in Canada." They said that if Canada starts professional
schools, they should "be located in very strong universities
and they should have the most elite admission standards pos-
sible" (p. 4). Rutgers appears to fit such a description better
than most professional schools. Unfortunately, most profes-
sional programs are free-standing or in smaller universities.
They must accept less than optimal applicants for financial
survival. Forty-five percent (N = 1,009) of the total of 2,220
professional schools' failed exams can be accounted for by 8
of the 65 professional programs.
A fundamental problem, in view of the huge differences
in selection ratio and GRE score, is that there is simply insuf-
ficient, very high-level talent to go around. It would appear
to be difficult to find creative solutions for this deficiency
without reducing the number of students admitted or the
phasing out of some of the weaker programs.
A troubling situation is that the National Council of
Schools of Professional Psychology (NCSPP) lists 19 associ-
ate members who do not meet the criteria for full member-
ship. The EPPPinformation on these programs is not provided
by the ASPPB and therefore is not contained in Table 1. The
NCSPP also lists four programs that are in the process of
developing doctoral programs in clinical psychology. All 23
of these programs appear to be free-standing or in nonpromi-
nent universities. The prognosis for psychology's profes-
sional school problem does not appear to be remarkably good.
Afinal caveat is that the EPPPassesses mastery of academic
knowledge but may or may not be related to the very important
therapeutic ingredient of client­clinician relationship. An even
more fundamental gap in our knowledge is that we do not
know if there is a relationship between EPPP performance and
client outcome. Research on this issue is recommended.
