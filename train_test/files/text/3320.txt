Introduction
Discipline or behavior management in schools is a com-
mon concern for beginning teachers and is frequently cited
as a significant component in early career attrition
(Goddard & Goddard, 2006; Hammerness, 2011; Hong,
2010). Moreover, the impact of perceived failure in rela-
tion to behavior in the classroom can substantially affect
the self-efficacy of teachers particularly at the beginning
of their careers (Hoy & Burke-Spero, 2005; Peters, 2009)
and the wide variety of discipline approaches adopted
within different schools can provide conflicting experi-
ences and models. Consequently, exploring and under-
standing more fully how we can support student teachers
in this area is important on a personal and professional
level for the student teacher and teacher educators.
Underpinning an urgency to consider this area, lies con-
cern for the young people who may find themselves the
focus of often punitive regimes (Bright, 2011; Reay, 2009).
We know that certain pupils (Gillies, 2011; Gray, Miller, &
Noakes, 1994; Reay & Wiliam, 1999) can be dispropor-
tionately affected by school discipline approaches particu-
larly with regard to exclusion or expulsion from schools
(Bright, 2011; Gillies, 2011; Osher, Bear, Sprague, &
Doyle, 2010).
This paper then is concerned with the details of two
individual case studies of student teachers during a 1-year
Initial Teacher Education (ITE) program--a Postgraduate
Diploma in Education (PGDE).1 The concern, here, was
with exploring the ways in which the beliefs and values of
student teachers might affect their engagement with differ-
ent approaches to behavior and how they could be encour-
aged to reflect critically on the philosophies underpinning
them. This critical engagement was supported through a
new elective course that set out to encourage a bridging
between theoretical and practical components of early pro-
fessional development (EPD). Establishing a stronger link
to the cognitive aspects of EPD while also helping student
teachers to engage meaningfully and critically with the
social and relational influences in schools, underpinned
the elective course.
Some Key Issues in the Literature
ITE and Developing Approaches to Behavior
In today's classrooms, increasing narratives of derision in the
media and in policy rhetoric, within the UK and beyond,
around poor pupil behavior (Gillies, 2011; O'Neill &
Stephenson, 2012) have led to calls for changes in the ways in
which teachers deal with discipline issues. Yet, until recently,
we had limited knowledge about the problems that teachers
face at the beginning of their career in relation to behavior
and whether support within ITE merely focused on immedi-
ate survival through application of rules and sanctions or on
specific behavior approaches. ITE providers may focus on
promoting traditional behaviorist outlooks (Atici, 2007; Ben-
Peretz, Eilam, & Landler-Pardo, 2011; Hammerness, 2011;
O'Neill & Stephenson, 2012), but in some cases, this may
mean little happens at the program level as student teachers
may be thought to gain behavior management skills while in
placement schools through experienced teacher modeling and
practice in classrooms (Hammerness, 2011). In other con-
texts, a more humanist approach to behavior may form a
small element within a larger Teacher Education program, but
this may be in contrast to the tendency toward behaviorist
models used in schools (Hamilton, in press; Riddell, 2006).
Emerging concern around student teacher development
and behavior in classrooms has increased in the past 5 years
across a wide range of national contexts (Atici 2007; Barker,
Yeung, Dobia, & Mooney, 2009; Ben-Peretz et al., 2011;
Hammond-Stoughton, 2007; Kyriacou & Martin, 2010;
McNally, I'anson, Whewell, & Wilson, 2005; Wubbels,
2011). Schleicher (2011) reporting on the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD)
research into teaching and learning across 23 countries found
that concerns around behavior were evident in most head

Around Behavior Management in Scottish

teacher responses and was a concern while teachers them-
selves were seeking help in approaching behavior manage-
ment. This underpins the significance of behavior as a key
issue at an international level in schools and within ITE.
Approaches taken to this aspect of teaching practice may
vary greatly across institutions and even within countries:
Ben-Peretz et al. (2011) found that in Israel, a traditional
approach dominated ITE, while Stough (2006) found that
only about 30% of such programs in the United States pro-
vided courses on behavior at all within ITE. There is no real
consensus on how best to prepare student teachers for behav-
ioral issues in schools, and a strong suggestion is that either
the responsibility for this aspect of EPD is placed within
school placement experience and modeling taking place
there or specific behaviorist and/or humanist perspectives
are taken in ITE. The latter provision is often regarded by
students as too abstract and not sufficiently practical or
applied (Ben-Peretz et al., 2011; Stough, 2006). Yet the nega-
tive role that behavior and misbehavior play in poor teacher
self-efficacy and lack of persistence within the profession
(Friedman, 2006; Hong, 2010; Peters, 2009) highlights the
impact that lack of preparedness can have on new teachers.
In addition, Van Tartwijk and Hammerness (2011) highlight
the significance of classroom management competence as
well as clarity of expectations and quality of feedback as
ways in which teachers can have a marked impact upon pupil
outcomes, and consequently, they argue, that classroom
management should play a much more substantial role within
teacher education. Questions then are raised over the shape
that any learning around behavior management should take
within ITE and how this might articulate with school place-
ment experiences.
Complex national and local policy and institutional
(school) approaches to behavior may chime or challenge stu-
dent teachers. Situated within schools, preservice learning
occurs within such policy umbrellas and via conversations
and dialogues with experienced colleagues (Avalos, 2011). It
is also helpful to acknowledge the significance of schools
and teacher approaches to behavior and relationships in the
classroom for pupil engagement or deviance from any norms
in place. The power imbalance inherent in this schooling
context between teacher and pupil (student), as well as stu-
dent teacher and experienced teacher, underlines the need to
engage critically with the ways in which teachers approach
behavior and relationships in the classroom and the role that
teacher education may play in supporting early teacher
development (Kyriacou & Martin, 2010).
ITE input and school experience are often seen as com-
plementary elements helping to shape student teacher prac-
tice and understanding, two connected but separate entities.
Yet, the possible conflicts within and across these spaces in
relation to behavior and building relationships with young
people have seen relatively little research (Atici, 2007).
Consequently, there is insufficient evidence with regard to
the ways in which ITE institutions can best provide support
so that student teachers can establish a strong foundation for
future development in working with young people across
these two spaces while dealing with the possible conflict that
may arise in terms of teaching practice, beliefs, and values.
Within ITE, the perennial theory­practice divide chal-
lenges teacher educators to find ways to engage with student
teachers meaningfully to enhance learning and the synthesis
of theoretical frameworks and practice. Some would argue
that to begin to do so, there is a need to conceptualize the
journey of student teachers (preservice teachers) as narra-
tives (Hamilton & Pinnegar, 2000), reflecting, at times, con-
flicting metaphors of teachers and teaching (Bullough &
Baughman, 1997; Clandinin & Connelly, 1995). In the next
section, consideration is given to the role of narrative in con-
ceptualizing and understanding student teacher EPD.
Narratives of Student Teachers
The narratives of student teachers and their visions of what
being a teacher means play an important role in the teaching
and learning experiences of those in schools (Schultz &
Ravitch, 2013). Narrative identity theory provides a helpful
conceptual frame here to view identity formation and refor-
mation as well as the complexity of individual "webs of
interlocution" (Taylor, 1992).
These webs comprise the myriad narratives of the indi-
vidual and at any one time one or more strands may hold
particular prominence for the student teacher, highlighting
some and sidelining others. This represents a complex inter-
action between different aspects of the self and the falseness
of attempts to separate the personal and the professional.
In using narrative identity here, the emphasis is placed on
the embeddedness of the individual within relationships and
experiences, within a multilayered and highly fluid telling
and retelling of who we are. There are narratives of mother,
of teacher, of belonging to community and nation and to
metanarratives of, for example, social justice and inclusion.
The personal and professional are not then able to be dislo-
cated from the web of narratives and myriad interlocutions
taking place. Yet, by engaging with the narratives that stu-
dent teachers tell as they attempt to make sense of teacher
education experiences in relation to past and future selves
and within policy and metanarrative contexts, we may be
able to more clearly understand how a sense of teacher self
may evolve and be supported (Hamilton, 2011). Within this
continual process of becoming, some narratives may hold
greater sway than others at any given time and, as Taylor
(1992) argues, "there may be changes to the web but there is
still a dependence on the web of interlocution" (p. 39).
In a previous study (Hamilton, in press), the author high-
lighted the narrowing of focus, by some student teachers, on
narratives of survival and compliance in response to social
and relational influences of teaching practice. The difficul-
ties faced by the students in trying to deal with behavior in
classrooms often created a degree of dissonance between
Hamilton 3
school values and beliefs and those of the student teacher.
The dominance of the powerful narrative of experienced
teachers in positions of power meant that survival and com-
pliance involved echoing the existing approaches, as mod-
eled by teachers in schools. Given the multiplicity of models,
student teachers were likely to superficially reflect contra-
dictory approaches to behavior but were not necessarily able
to engage with beliefs and values or broader ideas and texts
on behavior, weakening the possible influences on the narra-
tive web.
We know that student teacher stories of being and becom-
ing a teacher and the beliefs and values that inform their atti-
tudes within these stories are crucial in forming and reforming
professional identity (Bullough & Baughman, 1997; Johnson,
1988; Schultz & Ravitch, 2013). Such beliefs, often based on
student teachers' own lived experiences as learners, have a
tendency to persist even in the face of conflict with ITE pro-
gram teaching and, despite any conflict arising between
internal beliefs and external input (Sternberg, 1999).
McNally et al. (2005) highlight the tendency for student
teachers to build their budding professional identity on social
and relational connections to their past, present, and future
selves and to their practicum colleagues. However, it is
important to note that the latter colleagues are perhaps more
likely to have an impact than teacher educators on shifting
stances in relation to beliefs and values--at least on a tempo-
rary basis (McNally et al., 2005). Cognition is less likely to
be enhanced to the same extent and so finding ways to
encourage a greater balance between the emotional and rela-
tional aspects of teacher education experience and a more
active engagement with cognitive elements would appear to
be helpful if we are to encourage critical and reflective prac-
tice in relation to behavior.
Research suggests that we should not ignore or minimize
the significance of teacher beliefs and values (Bullough &
Baughman, 1997; Korthagen, 2004; Nias, 1989), their
engagement with or disengagement from ITE provision and
school experiences. For student teachers to more fruitfully
engage critically with their current beliefs and values while
attempting to evaluate possible alternative or extended mod-
els of thinking around behavior, it is argued here, that ITE
should not favor particular approaches to behavior but
instead should engage with conflicting stances and models,
via role-play, discussion, and debate, encouraging internal
cognitive dissonance within the student teacher to be
acknowledged and articulated (Hamilton, 2006). By this I
mean, encouraging engagement with conflicting beliefs, atti-
tudes, and values to bring about cognitive dissonance
(Festinger, 1957; Hamilton, 2011) in the individual. This
approach is somewhat at odds with other researchers who
argue that the personal and professional are separate
(Korthagen, 2004) and any friction between the two should
be avoided.
The prevailing student teacher approach to behavior dur-
ing a previous project (Hamilton, in press) had highlighted a
student teacher emphasis on looking to models for behavior
within schools coupled with a trial and error approach to
behavior underpinned by a vital survival instinct--an
acknowledged aspect of early professional learning (Feiman-
Nemser, 1983). This led to a struggle between compliance
with the dominant school models or resistance and adher-
ence to personal beliefs and values. As a result, in this proj-
ect, emphasis has been placed on the importance of
strengthening links between theory and practice through,
generating dissonance to make implicit beliefs explicit,
engaging student teachers in a critical selection and review
of significant moments from teaching practice. Within this
process, the ITE program does not want to sell a particular
discipline agenda but instead, student teachers are encour-
aged to "try on" different approaches bearing in mind the
constraints and opportunities in individual schools. One size
does not fit all, and students may build hybrid models of
engagement with young people. Through commentary on
their work, presentations, and challenge in conjunction with
the previous work outlined, student teachers are supported in
clarifying their choices, making sense of outcomes, and
throwing light on the relationships between their own beliefs
and values and their emerging professional choices in rela-
tion to practice.
Bullough and Baughman (1997) argue that student teacher
beliefs about teaching and the metaphors used by them have
a key role to play in their development as professionals.
Freese (2006) reinforces the role of reflection and inquiry
and sees these as a means of constructing meaningful stories
and engaging student teachers with deeper learning. Thus,
the student teachers participating in this study were located
within a course that focused on activities and experiences
that encouraged possible cognitive dissonance, explicit artic-
ulation of beliefs and values, and critical reflection.
Approaching the Study
Immediate Context of the Course on Behavior
Student teachers created reflective commentaries around,
"significant moments," choosing events/observations to
describe and analyze as a result of a value judgment made by
the individual (Tripp, 1993). The focus of such moments was
to do with relationships (negative or positive), behavior pol-
icy, and practice issues focused on teacher­pupil relation-
ships: These could involve observation of other staff or
student teacher own practice or could sometimes be a mix-
ture of both.
Activities were generated on the course that encouraged
cognitive dissonance in individuals (Hamilton, in press). For
example, media takes on behavior in schools are often writ-
ten with different kinds of bias depending on the political
stance of the newspaper. Students working in groups would
have to immerse themselves in the newspaper article and
come prepared to defend and debate that particular stance
4 SAGE Open
with other groups who represented conflicting stances. A
reflective exercise afterward then encouraged student teach-
ers to consider the dissonance or discomfort felt as a result of
the exercise and its significance. In this work, engagement
with student teacher tacit beliefs about behavior and pupils
(school students) was an important element as we know that
such beliefs tend to persist within the individual, even in the
face of teacher education experiences (Bullough &
Baughman, 1997; Korthagen, 2004; Swann, 1992). Making
such beliefs explicit and available for discussion and chal-
lenge was important to encourage a more in-depth engage-
ment with diverse views. Similar experiences were achieved
through the use of contrasting behavior expert views, critiqu-
ing videotapes of diverse teaching approaches, and role-play
within workshops. It is important to note that this course did
not set out to sell or inculcate a particular view of behavior
management, but instead shared diverse views and acknowl-
edged that each student's engagement with these different
perspectives and theories would be unique.
Method
The wider context for this project was a 1-year program of
teacher education (secondary-level PGDE) lasting 36 weeks
at a Scottish University: 18 of these weeks were spent on
placements in schools interwoven across the year--in 6
weekly segments. Diverse schools were drawn upon includ-
ing private schools, those with a predominantly middle class
intake, deprived urban schools, and rural schools across
many different Local Authority2 areas, and these were likely
to take diverse approaches to behavior. Student teachers have
the opportunity to opt in to a small number of elective courses
and 22 out of a program total of 150 chose to specialize in
behavior. Course participants came from a variety of disci-
plines including mathematics, geography and English. Two
students volunteered (self-selection) to be the focus of case
studies: They were both training to be English teachers.
Research questions. To meet the aims of the study, the follow-
ing research questions were developed:
Research Question 1: What are the key narratives under-
pinning two preservice teacher professional identity
(re) formations during a significant transition period in
their EPD?
Research Question 2: In what ways, if any, can the use of
"significant moments" and the creation of dissonance,
encourage engagement on a cognitive level with this
essential component of the professional role of
teachers?
A qualitative approach was chosen as the focus was
strongly fixed on the personal journeys and narratives of stu-
dent teachers and the belief that it is through understanding
these more fully that we can begin to make informed choices
about deeper learning and theory/practice divides (Hamilton
& Corbett-Whittier, 2013). Within this paradigm, instrumen-
tal case studies were chosen as the most appropriate as such
studies attempt to capture an issue or aspect of a case rather
than the case in its entirety (Hamilton & Corbett-Whittier,
2013; Stake, 1995). Case study usually involves a variety of
data collection tools as well as diverse perspectives (op cit),
and in this project, the following tools and perspectives were
drawn upon. The two student teachers, Annie and Will, pro-
vided reflective commentaries from each school placement
(significant moments) as well as one piece of extended writ-
ing and a final interview.Ateacher educator element (Author)
involved a tutor journal, capturing discussions and reflec-
tions with all 22 student teachers on this course as well as
concerns and dilemmas around the course or student issues
with school experience. Student teacher experiences on the
course and in schools and their charting of these journeys
orally and in writing provided an important aspect of Annie
and Will's experiences. The teacher educator journal, chart-
ing and reflecting on these activities, provides a helpful
background to both case studies. This presents some research
perspectives with a challenge as the teacher educator (TE)
researcher and student teachers were in a fluid, connected,
and negotiated relationship that does not attempt to argue for
objectivity and separation/distance between researcher and
researched. Instead, our mutual subjectivities were made
explicit through the course activities and challenged and
reflected upon throughout.
So in summary, this research involved a teacher educator
journal component in conjunction with a course focusing on
supporting critical engagement with diverse approaches to
behavior and active participation of student teachers as they
engaged with the course and school experiences and their
own emerging teacher research personas. Student teacher
data came from Annie and Will through reflective commen-
taries (×3 after each 6-week placement in schools), one piece
of extended writing, charting the journey made across school
placements, and their evolving approach to behavior--writ-
ten after second placement, and finally individual interviews
lasting 1.5 hr at the end of the course.
Triangulation and approach to analysis.Triangulation was
achieved via data collection and perspective: Diverse data
collection tools were used, and student teacher and tutor per-
spectives were explored. This enhances the trustworthiness
of the data (Hamilton & Corbett-Whittier, 2013; Patton,
2002) and emphasizes the importance of exploring the cases
in-depth and searching for rich accounts of evolving profes-
sionalism. Reinforcing the trustworthiness of the research
and analysis, member checking was used throughout data
collection processes and a colleague was also involved in
independently working on emerging and developing
categories.
However, it has to be acknowledged, that there is limited
breadth especially as the two case study students were both
Hamilton 5
en route to becoming English teachers. A future study will
attempt to attain a balance between the two elements through
a small cohort study and will also extend work to student
teachers working at primary/elementary level. A further limi-
tation for case study lies in its lack of generalizability, but
this is countered by Pollard (quoted in Hamilton & Corbett-
Whittier, 2013) by his argument that, in subtle ways,
case study research can produce a resonance for those in similar
contexts, with similar issues, providing insights to help them
understand, more fully, the nature of their own problems.
(Hamilton & Corbett-Whittier, 2013, p. 145)
The stance taken here is that such a resonance is what is
sought by the use of case study in this project. I would argue
that in qualitative research, especially case study, it is not the
size of case or number of cases that is important. Instead it is
the appropriateness of the choice of case, the quality of the
research process and the richness of the data and the insights
that can be gained, which are forefronted. Bassey (1999)
would be one of the first to criticize the use of unqualified
generalizations from small studies; however, he acknowl-
edges that there is value in what he calls fuzzy generalization
as opposed to the statistical notion of generalization in quan-
titative research. He argues that
Fuzzy generalization arises from studies of singularities and
typically claims that it is possible, or likely, or unlikely that what
was found in the singularity will be found in similar situations
elsewhere: It is a qualitative measure. (Bassey, 1999, p. 12)
Hamilton and Corbett-Whittier (2013), Bassey (1999),
and Stake (1995) all focus on
the subtle ways in which case study research can produce a
resonance for those in similar contexts, with similar issues,
providing insights to help them understand more, fully, the
nature of their own problems. (Hamilton & Corbett-Whittier,
2013, p. 145)
In this way, looking at qualitative research in general and
case study in particular, no claim is being made for a trans-
formation of understanding but instead for a refinement of
understanding (Stake, 1995, p. 7). Here is the strength of
qualitative work, in that it can provide insights into and
deeper understanding of the complex experiences and inter-
actions of student teachers that can have potential impor-
tance for others working in this area and does not rely on a
particular sample size when considering how worthwhile it
might be. The value of this kind of research is underpinned
by the validity and trustworthiness of the research process
and findings: supported by triangulation of data collection
method and perspective as well as the use of member check-
ing during the research process.
Analysis was ongoing throughout the project and each
stage of the project allowed for analysis and feedback to the
student teachers and so member checking was an integral
means of verifying and challenging the analysis process and
the findings. Key strategies in the analysis of the data, ini-
tially, involved drawing on themes that might hold resonance
for this aspect of teacher narratives in previous research
(Hamilton, in press) such as
·
· The attribution of blame for poor behavior
·
· Teacher role creating or challenging good behavior/
poor behavior
·
· Conceptualization of teacher identity and purpose
·
· Power and control
·
· Compliance with dominant discourses
This previous work had involved a pilot study of a cohort
of student teachers and aimed to begin to understand the pos-
sible issues that might face emerging professionals in rela-
tion to behavior. This led to the emergence of sensitizing
themes to begin to engage with the data. These themes were
used as a preliminary means of beginning to sort and analyze
data but with the intention of being open to new raw catego-
ries being found that might challenge or even overturn par-
ticular themes. A toing and froing across the data allowed the
final themes of each case study to be ratified through a return
to the data and independent verification but also through
member checking during the research process.
Ethics.It cannot be denied that there were ethical issues
inherent in this kind of approach where the tutor who grades
final assignments is also the researcher and researched. The
power imbalance is intrinsic to the institution and the official
relationship between tutor and tutee. However, I was keen to
ensure that student teachers understood that diverse views
were expected and one particular stance with regard to
behavior was not considered the answer. Although I estab-
lished explicitly my own views on behavior, I was also care-
ful to share my view that there were many successful
approaches to behavior and that part of this professional
journey involved them exploring these approaches and
school experiences critically while also reflecting on and
challenging their own beliefs about children and childhood.
In this way, student teachers could feel that they had the free-
dom to choose and would not be considered wrong if it
diverged from the views of the tutor (Hamilton & Corbett-
Whittier, 2013). Student teachers were also encouraged to
suggest particular dilemmas and/or texts that had relevance
for them and to lead the group in critically examining these
issues. The blurring of these boundaries between research,
researchers, and researched is viewed as a strength as it
encourages a negotiated research experience, a mutuality
that can enhance learning and understanding for all partici-
pants. National (Scottish Educational Research Association
[SERA], 2005) and institutional guidelines were followed
and this involved ensuring that participation was voluntary
and that anonymity would be provided in the tutor's journal
6 SAGE Open
and reflections while pseudonyms were used for the two case
study student teachers.
Policy context of the case study. The importance of behavior
in schools is recognized at policy level in Scotland, where in
the past 10 years, there has been increased funding for posi-
tive behavior programs and facilities. Munn's policy update
and report of 2009 (Munn et al., 2009) provide a helpful
insight into the perceptions of behavior in schools and
responses to it. Such work highlights the significance of
policy-level emphasis on the building of positive relation-
ships, and the increasing interest in Restorative practices as
a humanist rather than behaviorist model emerging in
schools, although Riddell's paper (2006) suggests a more
complex and tension-laden issue for individuals within
schools. In her paper, she notes the apparent embracing of
humanist approaches is more likely within primary schools
in Scotland (5-12-year olds) but that a male-dominated dis-
course of control and compliance focusing on rules, sanc-
tions, and punishment is more likely to hold sway within
secondary environments (12-18-year olds) despite govern-
ment innovations.
Findings
Teacher Educator Overview
All student teachers from this course focusing on behavior
set out their own aspirations at the beginning of the post-
graduate teacher education year suggesting their own con-
ceptualizations of the teacher they were going to become.
The terms used, provided some insights into the kind of
teaching metaphor they might be echoing. At this early stage,
descriptions focused on the specialist knowledge of the indi-
vidual preservice teachers and so subject content knowledge
held sway but a small number of student teachers suggested
other aspects of the professional--the rebel educator and the
creative educator. At this stage, too, early on in this intensive
1-year program, aspirational elements suggested the idealis-
tic with the use of terms such as caring, supportive, liberal in
thinking, could change lives, working for education and
equity, and empowerment of pupils. Yet, as we began to
examine how these student teachers related to behavior as a
classroom component, the language of control began to
emerge from many.
I'm not scared to give out punishments.
They have to understand that I am the law.
I want to be strict--they have to know who's in control.
Here the emphasis was on the teacher as the authority fig-
ure with right of enforcement of certain rules of behavior.
For other student teachers, understanding young people and
encouraging them to engage positively with the rules came to
the fore at this early prepractice stage. Using words and
phrases such as
Fair, consistent, just
Getting to know young people, understanding pupils
I want to be relaxed/innovative
But not too soft
Show them respect and they'll respect you, they'll follow
the rules
Almost all suggested a vision requiring compliance with
the rules and sought pupil acquiescence either through strict
adherence to rules or through a more relaxed engagement
with and application of rules.
As they moved through school experience, many began to
exhibit concern for the social and relational aspects of school
experience, desperate to fit in and ready to allow experienced
teacher prejudices and assumptions to be the template to sur-
vive within this assessed experience. For some this created
real quandaries, especially if they had had professional aspi-
rations that looked beyond control.
Building trust within the course, students began to
become more frank about their own beliefs and their concerns
with more humanist approaches. The power of colleagues'
often more behaviorist approaches in schools held particular
influence over student teachers and a real internal struggle
emerged as student teachers felt there was a demand to sim-
ply "copy" the model/approach taken by teachers in schools.
However, brief input at program level in the university was
thought to simply polarize views on behavior.
They [PGDE program] make you feel that the only way to deal
with behavior involves a humanist approach, restorative
practices but what if that's not you? (Tutor notes quoting student
from cohort)
The competing narratives calling to student teachers, cre-
ated real tension as they struggled with the need to comply
with university-based approaches to behavior to "play the
game" and pass the course. A similar degree of compliance
was sought within the school contexts (often behaviorist in
nature) where student teachers were also assessed. The vul-
nerability of student teachers to power imbalances (Lasky,
2005) is substantial at this time and within this vital transi-
tion highlights the possible pragmatic nature of the choices
made around behavior approaches.
Having used sensitizing themes as well as themes emerg-
ing from the data to grasp the key elements of the case, the
data are presented in relation to each case individually,
reflecting the narrative identity work in which the research is
situated. The use of extended quotes is deliberate, to share
the nature of the narratives in the participant's own words.
Developed critical consideration of the data is then taken up
in the discussion section.

Annie's Journey--Annie's Case Study: Narratives
of Rebellion and Compassion
Annie was by nature a little bit of a rebel who would question
the status quo or dominant narrative. She was determined to
listen to other viewpoints but was prepared, then, to chal-
lenge these and to find her "own way" to being a teacher. She
didn't want to reflect a particular model of teaching. Annie
had been adopted and had escaped a potentially difficult
family setup and this seemed to inform her desire to under-
stand young people and their varied and sometimes dysfunc-
tional home backgrounds. She was also a volunteer with
different groups for example with a group for women who
had been abused and for those who had learning difficulties
and so she held a strong advocate stance in the face of injus-
tice or inequity. In her early 20s, Annie was idealistic and
warmhearted with a passion for her subject area and she
approached her first placement school with anticipation.
However, her first school was a private one and there seemed
to be limited scope for active behavior strategies. The strong
consensus generated by the nature of the institution
(Hamilton, 2002, 2011) tended to encourage compliance as
the narratives of parents, pupils, and teachers tended to com-
plement each other. The school had suggested to her that her
quiet manner might become an issue when moving into more
demanding (with regard to behavior) state schools. Initially,
Annie complied with her first school's approach with regard
to strict rules and application of any sanctions.
On her next placement, Annie's context changed quite
dramatically as she moved into a state comprehensive (all-
comer) high school with a very mixed intake. Despite her
earlier support for a more humanist approach to young peo-
ple's behavior, she found herself in an environment that
relied heavily on rules, warnings, and punishments leavened
at certain points by the more humanist Restorative practices
approach.
This significant moment involved a first-year boy who is one of
nine children, himself being the second eldest and from a
dysfunctional complicated family who were in crisis. The pupil
had also recently been arrested for burning down a football club
house only the week before. This gives you some indication of
the situation the pupil was in. The pupil had been absent for the
first three weeks of my taking the class and so when he arrived
he found the different teacher unsettling. I was accused of
picking on him for simple reasons for example due to the
behavior policy (3 warnings written on board, third means pupil
receives punishment exercise and the fourth means that pupil is
sent from the class), anything serious results in calling your head
of department for a duty officer who is a member of SMT3 to
remove the pupil who is then dealt with and given evening
detentions while writing warnings on the board for several
pupils, I wrote the pupil in question's name first, which resulted
in a few minutes of shouting from the pupil accusing me of
picking on him. . . .the pupil should have been visited by a duty
officer and received detentions out with school hours, however
the PT (Principal or lead subject teacher) decided that this was
not necessary as it was too late on in the lesson. This caused the
pupil's behavior to deteriorate further and the verbal abuse
would begin the moment that he entered my classroom. I phoned
senior management myself. The pupil continued his aggression
in front of the depute head and then refused to enter an office
and left the school grounds. I learned that some pupils sadly
cannot be reached, they have too much going on in their lives
and cannot deal with the change brought about by a student
teacher on placement and that the best that you can do is to
follow an ineffective behavior code and remove the pupil from
the class.
(Annie second placement school, reflective commentary)
Here, Annie had tried to apply the behavior code and hier-
archy of measures that obviously were not helping with this
particular young person. The school's management team had
made a decision to use some elements of restorative practice
(RP) within a more punitive regime to try to make something
work. However, in this instance, it seemed to be the use of
strategy rather than an embracing of the philosophical ideas
underpinning RP. At this point Annie had to find a way to
deal with a lack of success with this pupil, and she focused
on the dominance of family and community contextual influ-
ences and the powerlessness of the system. Added to this was
a fragmented management structure that seemed unreliable
and at times contradictory.
What is schooling about?As Annie progressed through the
teacher educator course and placement experience, she began
to reflect more deeply on some of the power relations preva-
lent within school and her own beliefs and values around
education.
"control," many teachers I have witnessed think that they must
be in control at all times. However, I disagree with this approach
as I do not feel control is an important part of education, rather I
believe in a more liberal approach in which the focus on
education is creating a nurturing atmosphere in which children
feel comfortable and know that the teacher is there to aide them
in life and learning and not there solely to enjoy being in a
position of control at all times. Creating a tense atmosphere does
not in my opinion aid learning and growth of a young person
allowing them to prosper, which after all, is surely the point in
schooling and education.
(Annie--second placement, reflective commentary)
Where previously Annie had relied on the punishment
regime and short-term control within the classroom she had
begun to question fundamental aspects of the implications of
this approach and to consider how this might chime with her
own personal beliefs about schooling. Annie began to ques-
tion what she had previously accepted as the part of the
behavioral approach of the school--punishment.
8 SAGE Open
The only obvious "achievement" in using punishment to manage
behavior is to stamp out the behavior; there is no rehabilitation
side or enquiry into the behavior. Another negative effect of
punishment is the possibility that the pupil will rebel, as there is
no focus on restoring the relationship between pupil and teacher,
just in the teacher exerting their control over the pupil in the
classroom.
(Annie--second placement, reflective commentary)
Moment of revelation? We had spoken in the behavior course
about reaching a point, a moment of epiphany, one of many
in becoming a teacher when certain things seem very clear
and more fully understood. Annie characterized this as her
moment of revelation and reflects the natural movement for
the student teacher away from a focus on self and toward a
more reflective and critical view of experience, reading, and
practice.
This was my revelation--behavior management is not all about
a teacher, but a lot about the pupils and their backgrounds and
expectation from which you have to work and adapt and adjust
to. I adjusted my expectations and they adjusted their language
and sometimes with some classes that is enough--you have to
accept that silence while golden is not always possible and does
not sound the same for everyone.
(Annie--third placement, reflective commentary)
Annie's movement toward a different way of thinking
about engagement with pupils led her to reconsidering her
priorities and the nature of her relationships with the young
people she was working with and she began to ask the school
to give her very difficult classes.
I realized the complexity of behaviour management, there's not
just a problem and a solution. You have to live with some
uncertainty. I think before I had the idea of the perfect classroom,
children at desks, working away in silence but I had to change
expectations, look below the surface. I learned to let go of the
academic a little. I had to let go of my selfish needs. Yes, I had a
crit4 to pass, yes I had this and that to do but I had children. In
some classes, the focus had to be on making a connection. I had
one girl, it was a struggle to work with her. She was damaged
and aggressive and I was thinking how am I going to get them
doing things for my crit, for me. But then I thought no--what do
they need from me? That's what I have to give if I want to build
up real trust.
(Annie's interview at the end of the course)
Annie had delved into teacher metaphors and debated the
kind of model she might echo:
As an English teacher I cannot avoid turning to the metaphor in
order to make clear my interpretation and stance in behavior, I
think of the two very different roles of that of the fireman and
the policeman. The fireman simply arrives to put out the flame
and then leaves once the fire is extinguished, the policeman,
however firstly investigates and then if a charge is to be made
the person is then sent to a place of rehabilitation or must
perform some work within the community. I think we have a
choice as teachers when managing behaviour to either be the
fireman or policeman; we either stamp out the bad behaviour
and leave it at that or follow a longer process of investigation
and rehabilitation when managing the behaviour of our pupils.
The fireman's actions are suggested by those professionals who
agree with punishment and confrontation but yet there is a
distinct lack in these approaches to building a relationship with
the pupil and trying to promote positive behavior, whereas the
teacher who is the "policeman" attempts to manage the behavior
and lead to positive behavior by rehabilitation. The difference
between these two roles and subsequent approaches is made
clear by Stoughton (2007, p. 1033) who notes of teachers
managing behavior: Responses were frequently concerned with
putting out fires rather than helping children learn how to be
more successful classroom participants.
(Annie's extended writing in the last few months of the program)
Will's Case--an Alternative Journey
No negotiation--no discussion? Will was in his mid-30s on the
PGDE and, like Annie, learning to be a teacher of English in
high school. In the past, he had run his own company and
worked as a football player. Initially, he didn't have any
apprehensions about standing up in class and "being the
teacher." His approach to teaching in general and behavior
more particularly was very focused and straightforward. He
believed that the key support for his choices and strategies
would be the school and subject department policies and
sanctions. He suggested that there should be no negotiation,
no discussion over the rules governing behavior. He felt
comfortable with aspects of the behaviorist approach:
One morning, within the first 5 min of the period, she refused to
take out her jotter, sit at a table as instructed by me and to be quiet
when I was addressing her. Her behavior had clearly escalated
within such a short period of time that I had no option other than
to ask her to leave the class that morning. Outside the class, the
pupil was told why she was removed and where she would be
going. There was no negotiation. The class appeared very calm
and quiet when I reentered. When the regular class teacher was
informed of this, he advised this was the right course of action
and served to warn others in the class who might "try it on" in
future. The next time the girl came into class she was observably
quiet and withdrawn but got on with the work assigned and there
was no problem that day. I interacted with her as though nothing
had happened the previous time. I had to deal with several
incidents in this class where highly inappropriate behavior was
the main issue. Depending on the severity, these were dealt with
through the school policy regarding such indiscipline. The worst
cases were dealt with in the same way: Removing the pupil from
class, sending them on what is called "local referral" to an
adjacent or nearby class to be monitored by another teacher.
(Will's first placement school--reflective commentary)
Hamilton 9
However, as Will moved into second and third placements,
he was faced with diverse student populations. Suddenly
there were children from very low socioeconomic status as
well as new ethnic minority groups and so English as an
Additional Language (EAL) had to be considered, as well as
a wide range of Additional Support Needs (ASN) and some
with, "very tragic stories" (Will's Interview--end of pro-
gram). He certainly needed to rethink some of his ideas about
working and building relationships with young people.
I reflected that although I had "won" the battle of authority I felt
the matter had not been resolved satisfactorily. Thus, after
further reflection, I sought out opportunities in the final couple
of weeks of placement to "regain" John and develop one-to-one
discussion strategies further in an effort to work alongside this
pupil who had clearly manifested incommunicative and
challenging classroom behavior. On one occasion, I noticed
John passing in the corridor, affording an opportunity to speak
with him. I was genuinely impressed with the piece of poetry
that John had eventually handed in and commended him
accordingly, specifying exactly what was good about the work.
Here began the diffusing process of a potentially damaging
relationship and was certainly the catalyst for better relations
between teacher and pupil for the rest of the placement.
The handling of the insubordination though raised a number of
questions for me to consider. On the one hand, I was mindful to
support the guidelines presented within the School's Discipline
policy when dealing with John's indiscipline. I recognized any
clear guidelines adopted by the school will only be as good as the
consistency with which it is employed.That is why I used the whole
school agreement on behavior as the basis to discuss the matter
with John outside the classroom and enforce its punitive sanctions.
I felt this had been professionally achieved, but equally felt the
ensuing "confrontation" was potentially damaging to both parties
and could have been avoided. Although I "won" the battle of the
egos, lost was the creation of an arena within which to cater for
constructive one-to-one discussion. The error at this stage of
handling John's behavior was the lack of consideration for the rest
of the story. Firstly, John did not have a record of this kind of
behavior. Secondly, his tearful reaction proved to me that his
spiralling behaviour was not borne out of defiance but most
probably due to him having an "off day." (Will after second
placement school, extended writing)
Yet he did not see himself as having undergone a personal
transformation during this time and he was happy that he had
retained the key aspects of the person he was.
I'm true to myself but there are subtle shifts and a lot more to
develop and understand. In my childhood, I had to play a role, to
be an effective contributor and wherever I've ended up in life,
I've taken that working class, socialist view through the rest of
my life. I also happen to be religious and I try to aspire to my
beliefs and hopefully that comes across in how I try to deal with
others in a compassionate and fair way--I want to be a role
model for other working class boys. (Will's interview--end of
program)
Nonetheless, Will suggests the need for awareness and
reflection as he highlights the occasional shift back in
approach.
I do still have moments when I think, I'm older than you and you
should do what you're told and when that didn't transfer to
immediate respect, trying to think back to the course. Some
occasions when my authority was usurped and in close proximity
to a fourth-year pupil (16 years old), I probably raised my voice
and went masculine eyeball to eyeball but then realized his lack
of maturity and tears and realized I'd waded in with my tacketty
boots. (Will interview at end of program)
Will charted his evolving ideas around behavior and
building relationships with young people as part of the learn-
ing and teaching process and his movement away from his
earlier, "no negotiation, no discussion," stance was marked.
On a wider level, Bruner's theory of "reciprocity" has given me
further inspiration to incorporate strategies of handling
motivation during learning. "Reciprocity," Bruner states is an
"intrinsic motive, a deep human need to respond to others and to
operate jointly with them towards an objective." (Bruner, 1966,
p. 121) For pupils requiring help with motivation, the "motive to
conform" only Bruner adds is too much of an "abstraction."
Ingram and Worral's ideas on "negotiation" between teacher and
pupil is of help particularly when deployed in the conflict
resolution process. They contend that both parties act as
"negotiators who explicitly identify their differences from the
start" (Ingram & Worral, 1993). This arguably shifts the
traditionally constructed "power" of the teacher to a more
egalitarian footing allowing the pupil to feel a sense of worth,
identity and enhanced security within an already established
partnership with the teacher.
(Will, after second placement school, extended writing)
Don't Be a Rose Miss, Be a Thorn! Or
Don't Smile Until Christmas . . .
Discussion and Conclusion
In this section, I return to the narrative strands emerging
from the two case studies and explore the tension or even
dissonance experienced, the significance of student teacher
beliefs and values, the possible development of cognitive as
well as relational and emotional aspects of learning in ITE
and the possibility of the teacher as agent for change, even
within the early evolution of professional identity formation
and reformation.
In these two case studies, the student teachers have each
engaged with contrasting views on behavior and relation-
ships in schools within a university-based course and have
also experienced varied understandings of behavior as mani-
fested in schools by colleagues. The cognitive dissonance
made explicit at various stages encouraged them to engage
critically with these diverse ideas and to look for supporting
10 SAGE Open
evidence for taking different approaches. The significance of
the personal, the belief systems of the student teachers was
highlighted in the struggle that would ensue as they attempted
to reconcile their practice with policy and modeling at school
level. The greatest need for compliance, as might be expected
(Feiman-Nemser, 1983), was during the initial placements
that the student teachers encountered. This was also high-
lighted in an earlier study by the author (Hamilton, in press).
However, unlike the previous study where minimal interven-
tion occurred, this project deliberately set out to create and
encourage dissonance to highlight the moments of discom-
fort and challenge student teachers experienced, when
attempting to deal with contradictory ideas and beliefs.
Consequently, as each student teacher took slightly different
journeys through experience, dissonance and reflection sup-
ported a more meaningful engagement with behavior
approaches, leading to more informed choices about the way
forward in dealing with young people.
Student teachers were frequently faced with the myths of
teacher control through clichés such as don't smile until
Christmas and the power of such clichés was evident in the
reflections of the cohort of new teachers. Much of this cliché
was emerging in discussion, formal and informal, with expe-
rienced teachers, all of whom had a role to play in mentoring
and/or assessing students. The social and relational engage-
ments generated had particular power (Lasky, 2005) as
McNally et al. (2005) established in their EPD research, but
despite this, Annie and Will began to engage with them criti-
cally and to draw on other ways of thinking about young
people and teacher­pupil relationships.
Annie's journey began with a rebellious spirit working
within a compliant institution where consensus and confor-
mity was key and she began by subsuming her own rebel-
lious nature within a conforming exterior. Will, however, had
operated within teams and collaborations with strict rules
and ways of working prior to beginning his teaching course
and so reflected a view that echoed a rather traditional behav-
iorist approach to young people. Yet both student teachers by
the end of their course had made subtle shifts and changes to
their thinking through a critical engagement with and chal-
lenge to their own beliefs and values. This perhaps reflects a
movement away from what Sultana (2005) suggests is the
traditional academic model of teacher as professional where
assimilation and socialization into the existing models in
schools may hold sway. Instead this chimes with teacher as a
critical agent for change through formal or informal research
into practice (Sachs, 2003). Research here is used in a highly
inclusive sense. However, this suggestion of agency and the
development of cognitive elements within learning may not
echo what Sultana (2005) argues is the dominant paradigm in
ITE: the teacher as clinician, bound by central control and
determination/definition as well as competencies or perfor-
mance indicators. The course at the heart of this project did
not set out to push for the rightness of one particular model
of behavior. Instead, diverse views were discussed and
debated. The tutor's own approach to behavior was made
explicit but student teachers were encouraged to see this, not
as the orthodox way forward, but simply as one of the ways,
and this meant that the tutor had to also be ready to respond
to challenges to her own view in light of student teacher
experiences. The possibility of the teacher being a transfor-
mational agent (Sachs, 2003) in the classroom increased as
students gained confidence in their careful articulation of
their beliefs and understandings of behavior and relation-
ships in the classroom.
The use of dissonance as a mechanism to encourage
explicit acknowledgment and engagement with beliefs and
values appeared to support students in moving away from
reactive approaches to behavior. Although still dealing with
survivalist modes initially, they moved toward a more
thoughtful engagement with their own beliefs and values as
well as broader discussions and debate around behavior.
Student teachers quickly moved on from egos and gut reac-
tions and the need to "win control" and instead they began to
locate themselves more firmly as in partnership with young
people. Negotiation and regaining a child on side became
important but so did negotiating some space for their own
critical engagement with behavior approaches.
Significant moments and extended reflections encouraged
students to narrate their thinking and experience of behavior
to provide a springboard for student teachers to delve more
deeply into experiences and to make connections to theory
more readily. Extended reflections and significant moments
helped to broaden narratives being considered and debated
and helped to enhance student teacher understanding of their
own professional development evolution.
The engagement on this course with multiple models of
behavior management runs the risk of student teachers
understanding each model superficially rather than attempt-
ing to master the strategies of one model in depth. There is
research that suggests that a mastery of one approach is pref-
erable (Brophy, 2006; O'Neill & Stephenson, 2012), but the
argument made here is that such an approach tends to avoid
key aspects of student teacher narratives and the ways in
which these may reject such models or at least comply tem-
porarily while course assessments hold sway. This sole
model approach moreover does not deal with the situated
nature of student teacher learning and the role that "dia-
logues, conversations and interactions centered on materials
and situations"(Avalos, 2011, p. 7) may have on the media-
tion of behavior models.
In this paper, the narratives of individual student teachers
have helped to show the complexity of student teacher
engagement with behavior and with young people and the
need for teacher educators to engage more critically with this
aspect of EPD. As an essential component of professional
identity formation and reformation, relational, situated inter-
actions with regard to behavior are considered to be signifi-
cant (Beijaard, Verlop, & Vermunt, 2000). Yet, the
development of critical engagement at a cognitive level is
Hamilton 11
seen as essential (Bransford, Darling-Hammond, & Le Page,
2005) if teacher educators wish to encourage student teach-
ers to engage with this important aspect of their professional
experience and to invite dissonance to enhance teaching and
learning.
