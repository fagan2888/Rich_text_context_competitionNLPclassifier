Abstract
So far, color-naming studies have relied on a rather limited set of color stimuli. Most importantly,
stimuli have been largely limited to highly saturated colors. Because of this, little is known about
how people categorize less saturated colors and, more generally, about the structure of color
categories as they extend across all dimensions of color space. This article presents the results
from a large Internet-based color-naming study that involved color stimuli ranging across all
available chroma levels in Munsell space. These results help answer such questions as how
English speakers name a more complex color set, whether English speakers use so-called basic
color terms (BCTs) more frequently for more saturated colors, how they use non-BCTs in
comparison with BCTs, whether non-BCTs are highly consensual in less saturated parts of the
solid, how deep inside color space basic color categories extend, or how they behave on the
chroma dimension.

Introduction
We name colorful objects on a daily basis; yet, it seems we tend to use mostly a subset of a
vast number of available color expressions. For example, in contemporary English, we tend
to refer to the color of objects using terms like black, white, red, blue, green, yellow, brown,
pink, orange, purple, gray more often than we use terms like tan, peach, or violet (Lindsey &
Brown, 2014; Sturges & Whitfield, 1995). The apparently preferred color expressions have
come to be known as ``basic color terms'' (or BCTs, for short).1
These observations result partly from color-naming studies. Most color-naming studies
conducted in the past century have used the Munsell system (Munsell, 1941). The best known
studies--Berlin and Kay's (1969) study and work building on it--relied on the 330 color

chips shown in Figure 1, which consist of 320 chromatic chips, covering 40 hues, each at 8
value levels (in Munsell terminology, value refers to the brightness of a color), and of an
additional 10 achromatic chips, varying from black to white through various shades of gray.
Importantly, each of the chromatic chips is at maximum chroma (referring to saturation in
Munsell notation2) for its hue­value combination. Thus, while the participants in the
aforementioned studies were presented with color chips systematically varying across
several hues and value levels, they were only presented with one high chroma level for
each hue and value combination. Consequently, these studies identified color categories
that were shown to extend over hue and value ranges, but without providing any
information about the way categories behave along the dimension of chroma. This led
Kay et al. to make the following comment:
Lack of focus appears to be characteristic of desaturated terms, and probably of heterogeneous
terms generally. Since the WCS data contain only hues at maximum available saturation, careful
study will be required to decide if and when a `desaturated' term may name an unbroken volume
of the [Munsell] color solid. (Kay, Berlin, Maffi, & Merrifield, 1997, p. 34)
The data from previous studies show BCTs, which are used at the surface of the solid
(Boynton & Olson, 1987; Sturges & Whitfield, 1995), to extend over an unbroken area
(or what is known in topology as a connected region). What naming behavior can be
expected in desaturated parts of the system? Kay et al. recognize that though color terms
used to name the most saturated colors have been shown to delimit unbroken areas on the
surface of color space, it is still an open question whether this finding generalizes to less
saturated colors, for data from previous studies seem to suggest that terms in the desaturated
parts of Munsell (a) may be diffuse, or lack focus, or (b) have a patchy or scattered extension
(more on this in the following paragraphs). To date, no free color-naming study involving a
large number of participants has been conducted using the totality of the Munsell system,
most importantly including the less saturated or desaturated chips. This being said, various
studies have analyzed color naming in different ways, in some cases including less or much
less saturated colors.
For example, in Sivik and Taft's (1994) color-naming study, all the colors available in the
Swedish Natural Color System (NCS) were used, including all the less saturated ones. The
NCS is a descriptive color system that relies on Hering's (1878/1964) primaries as variables to
judge color appearance. These variables can be reduced to blackishness (or brightness),
chromaticness (or saturation), and hue. Sivik and Taft (1994) preidentified 16 color terms
of interest, to wit, six ``elementary'' color terms: Swedish terms for white, black, yellow, red,
blue, and green; seven additional common terms: Swedish terms for gray, brown, beige, lilac,

orange, violet, and pink; and three less common terms: Swedish terms for rose, olive green, and
purple. They then conducted a typicality task where participants were provided with a color
patch, the preidentified color terms shown one at a time, and a 7-point Likert scale along
which participants were asked to ``mark how well the color sample corresponds with what
you mean by the color word shown above'' (p. 147). The study shows that Swedish terms for
brown, beige, pink, and olive green extend exclusively in parts of the NCS space that are of
middle to lower chromaticness (saturation).
Another notable study is Boynton and Olson's (1987) mapping of Berlin and Kay's (1969)
BCTs in a color space that would be perceptually uniform along the three dimensions. They
proceeded with a free color-naming study using the Optical Society of America Uniform
Color Space (OSA­USC) system. The latter consists of a set of 558 color chips, varying on
three dimensions (L, for lightness; j, a yellow­blue dimension; and g, a red­green dimension).
Their results confirm the findings of Berlin and Kay and the World Color Survey (WCS),
showing that people used BCTs most frequently. Also, participants were fastest when they
used BCTs in comparison with non-BCTs. Boynton and Olson (1987) were also interested in
the location of basic color categories in color space and their spatial relations to each other.
They noted that all basic colors except brown and gray lie toward the outside of the color
solid. Brown and gray ``bridge'' between nonadjacent colors, meaning that as these categories
extend inside color space and not at its surface, they bear similarity relations to categories
that extend at the surface of the solid and are nonsimilar to each other. But ``a region of color
samples remains for which there is no such inside bridge, within which color naming is erratic
and inexact.'' That is the region participants ``struggle'' to name, and where the nonbasic
terms peach and tan occur (Boynton & Olson, 1987, p. 104).
Boynton and Olson's experiment was in turn extended by Sturges and Whitfield (1995)
who used the Munsell system. In this study, a subset of 446 samples from the Munsell system
was used. Like Boynton and Olson, Sturges and Whitfield observed an overwhelming use of
BCTs; only ``a relatively small portion of the names given were nonbasic'' (p. 366).
Despite the interesting insight into naming behavior across several levels of chroma that
these studies provide, there are some limitations that leave the question of desaturated
categorization without a satisfying answer. Although in Sivik and Taft's (1994) study the
colors used unambiguously ranged across all three dimensions of the NCS, their stimuli
cannot be directly compared with data collected with Munsell stimuli. It is also to be
recalled that Sivik and Taft did not conduct a free naming task. In the case of Boynton
and Olson (1987), 424 color samples from the available 558 OSA­USC samples were used,
and ``134 intermediate samples, which cover near-neutral regions of colors of middle
lightness'' (p. 94) were excluded. As a result, it is not clear to what extent less saturated
colors were included and, therefore, how these are named. Also, Boynton and Olson's study
involved only seven participants, and though all three dimensions of the OSA­USC system
were used, the observations they share in their article mainly pertain to hue and value, and
reference to saturation is limited. Finally, Sturges and Whitfield (1995) needed to choose a
limited number of samples, which were equally spaced across the Munsell system. That was
problematic because, due to the shape of the system, low-chroma chips are more similar to
each other (more closely spaced) than high chroma chips at the same hue­value combination.
Sturges and Whitfield's solution to this problem was to sample more colors as chroma level
increased. As a result, their set includes more high-chroma colors than low-chroma colors,
possibly favoring a prevalence of BCTs in comparison with non-BCTs among their
participants' responses.
There is indeed a relationship between BCTs and saturation (e.g., Olkkonnen Witzel,
Hansen & Gegenfurtner, 2010, p. 14), which led some to wonder whether different
Jraissati and Douven 3
consensual color terms would emerge if different, perhaps less saturated, color stimuli were
included in naming experiments (Witzel, 2016). This is an important question because, apart
from the frequency of their use, BCTs have several other interesting characteristics. The
categories these terms refer to appear to be universal in that some or all of them are
lexicalized in many spoken languages (Berlin & Kay, 1969; Cook, Kay, & Regier, 2005;
but see also Kuschel & Monberg, 1974; Levinson, 2001). Moreover, basic color categories
appear to be graded--that is, items can fall under these categories to different degrees--where
a central member or central area (or region) elicits highest consensus, fastest reactions times,
and is identified as the category's best example or set of examples. Consensus tends to taper
off (and reaction times become larger) as we move away (in the Munsell system, or in OSA­
USC) from the best examples. Various authors have argued that what makes these color
categories basic has to do with the makeup of our perceptual and cognitive apparatus
(Jameson & D'Andrade, 1997; Kay, Berlin, & Merrifield, 1991; Kay & McDaniel, 1978;
Regier, Kay, & Khetarpal, 2007; but also see Abbott, Griffiths, & Regier, 2016; Jraissati &
Douven, 2017). Thus, the results of color-naming studies have important implications
regarding our understanding of sensory categorization, which is an important reason to
call for a more complete view of color-naming behavior than has hitherto been undertaken.
It is expected that BCTs will name mostly saturated colors, but exactly how unsaturated
colors can be while still being named by a BCT is unknown. Indeed, color categories are
graded, as mentioned. We are aware of the tolerable degrees of hue and value variation for
color categories identified at the surface of the Munsell system, but no such information is
available for chroma. In the context of her studies on color codability and memory, Rosch
(Heider, 1972), who also uses Munsell colors, suggests that basic color categories' focal colors
(or best examples) are most saturated, and inherently more codable. Specifically, Rosch
reports that ``the boundaries of Dani chromatic terms do not extend as far into the
unsaturated colors as boundaries of English chromatic terms'' (p. 456), thereby suggesting
that English color categories do extend deep into the unsaturated layers of the Munsell
system, though it is not clear how deep these terms extend (note that the naming responses
for unsaturated colors were limited to 40 color chips in Rosch's study). Yet, some conflicting
observations stem from the work of Roberson, Davidoff, Davies, and Shapiro (2005), who
point out that ``[f]or Himba speakers, as for English and Berinmo speakers, these very
desaturated stimuli are poor examples of their basic categories, and thus hard to name''
(p. 387).
In what follows, we present the results of a new, large color-naming study that was meant
to gather data using all colors available in Munsell (insofar as it is representable in RGB
space), including the nonmaximally saturated ones. We thereby hope to partly answer the
question stated in the earlier quote from Kay et al.'s (1997) article while also taking some first
steps toward addressing the concern of whether a different set of colors, including less
saturated ones, might lead to different consensual expressions.
In our analysis, we were specifically interested in the following questions: How do English
speakers name a more complex color set (i.e., including very low saturated, intermediately
saturated, and saturated colors)? Do nonbasic color expressions and terms emerge as
consensual categories? Are basic color categories still overwhelmingly used? More
generally, how frequently do native speakers of English use BCTs in comparison with
non-BCTs when categorizing the whole of the Munsell system? And over what portion of
color space do basic color categories and nonbasic color categories extend? Do basic color
categories lie mostly at the surface of the solid, as Rosch (Heider, 1972) and Roberson et al.
(2005) suggested? If so, how deep inside the Munsell system do they extend? More generally,
how does color-naming behavior relate to chroma? Specifically, taking consensus as a
4 i-Perception 9(4)
measure of graded membership (see see Section Chroma, consensus, and BCTs, p. 12 for
references), we can ask whether membership to color category is graded along the chroma
dimension as well.
Study
The study to be reported here was conducted online. Online studies have rapidly gained
popularity among psychologists and social scientists, thanks to the availability of
crowdsourcing services such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower. These services
enable scientists to gather large amounts of data in a matter of days, sometimes even hours, at
moderate costs. To obtain comparable amounts of data in laboratory studies would often be
impossible because it would be unaffordable or because of other impracticalities. While the
methodology of running surveys over the Internet has been widely accepted by the scientific
community, one might have concerns over its use for perception studies and other studies that
have traditionally been carried out under strictly controlled viewing conditions in laboratories.
The control that researchers have in a laboratory setting is obviously absent in Internet-based
experiments, with participants using different monitors, operating systems, or web browsers.
This lack of control may seem especially problematic for online color experiments, given that in
color research, viewing conditions may be even more important than in research on, say, slope
estimation or the recognition of facial expressions.
Recently, however, there have been a number of efforts to check the validity of online
color research. Moroney (2003), Mylonas and MacDonald (2010), Mylonas, Paramei, and
MacDonald (2014), and others report successful replications in Internet-based studies of
experiments that had previously been conducted in a controlled laboratory setting. We
take these studies as a justification of sorts for the methodology of our study while also
acknowledging that the results to be reported are to be interpreted with some caution.
Method
Participants. There were 1,870 participants in this study. All participants were from Australia,
Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, or the United States. They were recruited via
Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, where they were directed to the Qualtrics platform via
which the study was administered. Participants were financially compensated for their
cooperation. Repeat participation was prevented through the Qualtrics software.
We first removed data from 381 participants who had submitted incomplete response sets.
Next, we removed data from the fastest and slowest 2.5% participants, as well as from
participants who indicated that they were nonnative speakers of English, color blind, or
who answered in the negative to a question of whether they had taken the task seriously
(by adding this question, we followed a recommendation of Aust, Diedenhofen, Ullrich, &
Musch, 2013). This left us with 1,338 participants. From those participants, we further
removed the ones who failed a color-sorting task that was presented at the end of the
survey and served as a quality check (see Douven, Wenmackers, Jraissati, & Decock,
2017). This left us with 1,177 participants for the final analysis.
These participants spent on average 693 seconds on the survey (Æ318 seconds); 735 of
them were female; 972 indicated that they had a college degree, 188 indicated that they had
high school as their highest education level, and 17 indicated a lower education level.
Although the sorting task served as a data quality check, we are aware of the importance
of individual differences in color perception (Lindsey & Brown, 2014; Witzel & Gegenfutner,
2013) and the fact that such differences will almost certainly have affected our results.
Jraissati and Douven 5
Equally important, given that our study was conducted online, is that Qualtrics registered a
great variety of browsers, operating systems, and types of screen that had been used by our
participants. Specifically, 67% had used the Chrome browser, 21% Firefox, 5% Safari, and
the rest some other browser (e.g., Edge, MSIE, Opera); as for operating systems, 76% had
used some version of Windows, 21% some version of the Macintosh operating system, and
the rest some other operating system; finally, screen resolution varied so greatly that
no summary description is possible (detailed information is easily retrievable via the R file
in the Supplementary Materials). With this in mind, we would like to emphasize that we
aim to present a first broad exploratory study that, we hope, will indicate interesting
directions for future experiments, which would then be ideally carried out under better
controlled conditions.
Materials and procedure. The stimuli consisted of a set of 1,625 Munsell chips available from the
website of the Program of Color Science, Munsell Color Science Laboratory, Rochester
Institute of Technology (PoCS/MCSL). The 1,625 stimuli were randomly divided over 25
sets of 65 stimuli each. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of those sets and
was administered the 65 stimuli in the set, individually and in an order randomized per
participant. Some Munsell stimuli are out of gamut and cannot be represented in RGB
space. These stimuli are therefore not in the conversion file provided by the PoCS/MCSL.3
The RGB coordinates given in that file were used to define the colors in the Qualtrics software.
Two hundred ninety-three stimuli out of the 1,625, randomly spread across the Munsell
system, were discarded due to a coding error on Qualtrics that affected their RGB
coordinates and compromised their rendering (the list of compromised colors is provided
in the Supplementary Materials). The current study therefore presents the naming responses
of the remaining 1,332 colors. The analyses to be presented in the following included only the
responses to these 1,332 stimuli.
At the start of the survey, participants were informed that they would be shown 65 color
patches one by one and were instructed as follows:
Please name, in English, each of the 65 colors the way you spontaneously feel is most
adequate--imagine you are conversing with a friend and need to identify an object by
its color.
(1) Do not overthink your response!
(2) Be as concise as possible.
(3) Each color is unique, although some colors might very much look alike: So do not worry
if you need to use the same color label several times.
After filling an online demographic questionnaire (age, gender, education level, normal or
corrected-to-normal vision, color blindness), participants started the free naming task. Each
stimulus appeared on a separate screen as a uniformly colored patch of 225 Â 225 pixels
against a uniformly gray background with RGB coordinates (124, 124, 124). Below the
color patch appeared the question, ``How would you name the above color?'' Beneath this
question was a text box in which participants could type their response.

the Mathematica notebook and the R file that were used for the analysis are also given in the
6 i-Perception 9(4)
following and can be used to obtain further results by readers who have access to the requisite
software packages. While R is open source, Wolfram's Mathematica is proprietary software.
For readers who do not have access to Mathematica, the online materials include a
computable document format (CDF) document. This document can be viewed in
Wolfram's CDF Player, which is freely available at https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/,
but which offers limited functionality.
Descriptive statistics. There were in total 74,874 responses given to the 1,332 stimuli. Each of
the stimuli received an average of 47 responses (Æ3.8), with a range from 38 to 55. On
average, 30.22 (Æ13.11) of a participant's responses consisted of exactly one word.
Compound expressions were used in 24,707, or 33%, of the responses. On average, 19.37
(Æ11.24) of the participants' responses consisted of exactly two words, 1.50 (Æ3.07) of exactly
three words, 0.07 (Æ0.37) of exactly four words, and 0.05 (Æ0.75) of five or more words.
A Mann­Whitney U test showed that female participants were significantly more likely to use
a compound expression than male participants, though the effect size was small
(W ¼ 179, 950, p ¼ .002, r ¼ À:09).
Table 1 shows the 100 most frequently used terms, together with the corresponding counts.
(The full list of terms can be generated by running the relevant part of the R file in the online
materials.) Because too many spelling mistakes occur that more often than not make it
impossible to identify the color terms intended, in this table, we present the counts
reporting participants' responses exactly as they are.
Notably, at the top of the frequency list appear the majority of the BCTs. In English, these
terms have so far been identified as white, black, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, gray/grey,
purple, orange, and pink (Berlin & Kay, 1969; Lindsey & Brown, 2014; Sturges & Whitfield,
1995). In our study, these terms appear in the following order, from most to less frequent:
purple, green, blue, pink, brown, black, orange, gray, yellow, and red. White is still quite
frequent, but less frequent than the nonbasic terms tan, peach, and maroon or certain
compound expressions including a BCT.
Thus, looking only at frequency, it would seem that the traditional distinction between
BCTs and non-BCTs is roughly maintained. Clearly, frequency of term use varies
continuously, and it is possible that terms traditionally considered as nonbasic are in the
process of stabilizing and becoming basic. In fact, the 10 most frequent non-BCTs observed
in this study (see later) were also observed in a recent American English color-naming study
(Lindsey & Brown, 2014), which featured the 330 Munsell chips of the WCS. The question of
the possible stability with which these nonbasic terms refer to specific color stimuli is raised and
will be addressed in the following sections. For the purpose of convenience, we will stick here to
the distinction, common in the literature, between basic and nonbasic terms. The BCTs
appearing in our study are white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, brown, gray/grey, pink, and
purple; and the 10 most frequent non-BCTs are teal, tan, peach, maroon, mauve, violet, lavender,
magenta, beige, and lilac.
A BCT occurred in 49,181, or 66%, of the responses. In the following, we distinguish
between pure and impure references to BCTs, where the former are responses that consist of a
single BCT, while the latter are responses that contain a BCT as part of a compound
expression (as in forest green, baby blue, light pink, purplish gray, etc.). Pure BCTs made
up 21,946, or 29%, of the responses, and impure BCTs occurred in 27,235, or 36%, of the
responses.
Beyond mere frequencies of color terms, we were interested in systematic relations between
the terms used and color coordinates. We were especially interested in how color naming
depended on chroma.
Jraissati and Douven 7
The analysis to be given consists of both relevant statistics and relevant visualizations of
the results. All statistics were carried out assuming the Munsell coordinates. However, in the
case of some visualizations, we used the CIE 1976 L*u*v* space (or CIELUV space), which is
recommended by the Commission Internationale de l'E
´clairage (CIE) for the characterization
of colored displays on television or computer screens (Malacara, 2002, pp. 86­90). To display
the stimuli in CIELUV space, we converted their RGB coordinates as provided in the PoCS/
MCSL file to CIELUV coordinates using Mathematica's built-in ColorConvert function.
Figure 2 shows the stimuli in CIELUV space.
Modal and majority responses
Hue/chroma representation of naming frequencies. There are a number of different ways to
summarize the color-naming data in relation to the coordinates of the stimuli.
Straightforward summaries are given in the figures in Appendix A, which feature mode
maps at three value levels. The maps feature Munsell hues on the x axis and Munsell
chroma on the y axis (please note the gamut limitation at high chroma mainly in the G­B
range). In the mode maps featuring most frequent responses in association to one color chip,
we used all color responses, and we treated any compound expression as an instance of the
monolexemic color term appearing in that expression. So, for example, dark blue and sky blue
are treated as instances of blue; light teal, as an instance of teal.

In Figure A1, which presents a mode map of most frequent expressions, a mix of BCTs
and non-BCTs appears. At value 9, 6, and 3 (V9, V6, and V3), the consensus for blue and
green is overall quite low (usually not exceeding 0.3). Yellow's extension is largest at V9, but
consensus for yellow surprisingly peaks (0.6) at 10YR where maximal chroma is limited to
8 and 6 (C8 and C6), and at 5Y, at low chroma (0.7 at C4). Purple reaches highest consensus
(0.4), mostly at V6, at high chroma (C12 to C22), and at middle to low chroma (C8 to C2)
at V3. The consensus for pink is highest (0.5) at V6, at high chroma (C14 and C22). As for
non-BCTs, peach occurs at V9, and peaks (0.5) at C6 while also reaching a high consensus
(0.4) on most its extension. Teal is most visible at V6 and V3, reaching a very high consensus
(0.7) at V3, at low chroma (C4). Other notable non-BCTs that reach relatively high consensus
are salmon (0.5 and 0.7, at V6) at high, though not maximal, chroma (C10 and C12); tan
(0.4 and 0.6 at V6), at low chroma (C2 to C6); and maroon (0.5 at V3), at relatively low
chroma (C6).
Thus, in these mode maps featuring most frequent expressions, the pattern of response in
relation to chroma is unclear. One possible explanation pertains to the use of modifiers and
qualifiers. For example, if there is a consensual use of forest green for unsaturated shades of
green, this will translate in mode maps as an increased consensus for green at low chroma.
Another possible explanation of the absence of a clear response pattern in relation to chroma
pertains to the fact that BCTs and non-BCTs might overlap rather than jointly partition
color space (more on this in the Discussion and Concluding Remarks section). Indeed, using
mode maps as a tool to explore the way color space is categorized rests on the assumption
that apart from marginal overlapping at the periphery of categories, most frequently used
expressions refer to categories that do not overlap, but jointly categorize the space. However,
if these BCTs and non-BCTs overlap, looking at reached consensus levels across all
expressions might be confusing, leading to scattered extensions. Thus, if these various
expressions overlap rather than jointly partition color space, mode maps as in Figure A1
would possibly conceal the extensions of categories in some cases, and thereby obscure a
possible relation to chroma. It would therefore be more useful to look at the extensions of
these two sets of unmodified expressions separately. In what follows, we examine pure BCTs
and pure non-BCTs separately.
When taking into consideration only pure BCTs (Figure A2), the frequency pattern gains
in clarity, as can be seen in the respective bottom charts. The consensus of yellow (at V9, 0.8
at C12), green (at V6, 0.8 at C12), blue (at V6 and V3, 0.6 at C12 and C18, respectively), red

(at V6, 0.4 at C18), orange (at V6, 0.8 and 0.7 at C12 and C16, respectively), purple (at V3, 0.8
and 0.7, from C8 to C18), and pink (at V6, 0.6 and 0.4, from C12 to C20), all peak at high
chroma levels and decrease at lower chroma.
Thus, when it comes to the use of pure BCTs, and in contrast to the mode maps featuring
all expressions including modified and qualified BCTs (Figure A1), the tendency in the
frequency pattern is to increase with increasing chroma.
We now turn to the mode map including only non-BCTs, specifically the 10 most frequent
monolexemic, or pure, non-BCTs: mauve, lavender, maroon, violet, peach, tan, beige, lilac,
magenta, and teal (see Figure A3).
Non-BCTs in this figure appear mostly in the R­Y hue ranges (peach, maroon, tan, beige)
and in the P­RP hue range (mauve, lavender, violet, magenta, lilac). Indeed, as in the case of
BCTs, the G­B hue range is overall named by fewer terms than the R­Y and P­R hue ranges,
probably because of varying sensitivity of human receptors across the spectrum (MacAdam,
1942).
Comparing Figures A1 and A3, we see that the extensions of non-BCTs in the latter figure
are somewhat less scattered than in the former. Overall, consensus is quite low. Non-BCTs
that reach highest consensus (from 0.3 to 0.5) are teal (0.5 at V3, C4, and 0.4 at V6, C6),
peach (0.3 at V9, C6, and at V6, C8 and C12), tan (0.3 at V6, C2, C4 and C6), maroon (0.3 at
V3, at C6 and C10), and lavender (0.3 at V6, C6 and C12).
This result confirms that non-BCTs seem indeed to overlap with BCTs, without coinciding
with them exactly. Comparing Figures A1 to A3, one can see that teal, for example, at V6
ranges from GY to PB, reaching highest consensus at the boundary of blue and green. Peach
extends over parts of pink and parts of orange. The extension of tan overlaps partly with that
of brown and partly with that of orange. The extension of magenta is mostly within that of
pink, extending only over the most saturated parts. Lavender extends within purple, but only
in the P hue range, while mauve extends within purple, but only in the RP range at low value,
and parts of pink.
However, because overall consensus is low, it is hard to detect a pattern in naming
responses that would inform us about the structure of these categories, in particular, in
relation to chroma. Low consensus suggests either that people still use BCTs relatively
frequently in reference to these colors or that they use too many different expressions on a
given chip for one non-BCT to stabilize.
Chroma/value representation of response frequency. Perhaps a different view of the Munsell
solid might reveal different patterns. To make sure that this is not the case, the present section
examines the relation between consensus and Munsell chroma in mode maps featuring
chroma on the x axis and value on the y axis at one specific hue. The relevant
visualizations are in Figures A4 to A6 in Appendix A.
In the mode maps featuring most frequent responses in association to one color chip, as
previously described, we used all color responses and treated compound expressions as an
instance of the monolexemic color term appearing in that expression. Each mode map is at
one specific hue (10B, 10P, 10R, 10G, and 10Y).
As we have seen in the hue­chroma chart featuring all expressions (Figure A1), the pattern
in frequency of response in the chroma­value chart featuring all expressions (Figure A4) is
not clear. For the same reasons stated earlier (see Hue/Chroma Representation of Naming
Frequencies section), we look at pure BCTs and pure non-BCTs separately in what follows.
Figure A5 shows mode maps including only pure BCTs, on a two dimensional chroma­
value diagram, at five different hues. The trend that can be discerned in Figure A2 can also be
seen here: Consensus is higher at high chroma for blue (0.5 at 10B, V4 and V5, at C6 and C8),
10 i-Perception 9(4)
red (0.6 at 10R, V7, C14), orange (0.7 at 10R, V6 and V7, C12 and C16, and at 10Y, V6, C6),
yellow (0.6 at 10Y, V9, C8 and C10), purple (0.8 at 10P, V4, C12), and pink (0.5, at 10P, V8,
C14). Consensus for green is relatively low (0.4, 0.3 at 10G, V3 and V4 and V5 at C2 and C4).
Brown peaks at low chroma (0.6 at 10R, V3, C2), as one would expect.
Finally as to the most frequently used pure non-BCTs, Figure A6 shows naming responses
for the 10 most frequent monolexemic, or pure, non-BCTs, displayed in two dimensional
chroma­value diagrams.
As observed in Figure A3, overall consensus is low. Specifically, most consensual and least
scattered categories are teal, which is used most frequently at 10G (0.4 at 10G, V5, C8), and
at 10B (0.2, V3, C4), though less consensually, and peach (0.5 at 10R, C6). Tan (0.3 at 10R,
V8, C4), magenta (0.2 at 10P, V5, C18), maroon (0.2 at 10R, V2, C6 and C8), and beige (0.2 at
10R, V7, C2, and 0.1, at 10Y, V8, C2) are worth noting, as either their extensions are not too
scattered, though less consensual than teal and peach (magenta, beige, and maroon), or they
reach a high level of consensus, but their extension here looks scattered (tan). The remaining
most consensus pure non-BCTs (mauve, lavender, violet, and lilac) are below 0.2 of consensus
(violet, lavender, lilac) or have too scattered extensions (mauve, lilac) at these hues (10B, 10P,
10R, 10Y, and 10G).
Visual examination of the extensions of BCTs and non-BCTs in various mode maps, in
two different views of the Munsell system (on hue vertical planes and value horizontal
planes), suggests that consensus in the use of BCTs typically increases with chroma. BCTs
are still used at low chroma, however, though at lower consensus. Like BCTs, non-BCTs are
used across chroma levels. Some expressions, such as tan, beige, or peach, seem to refer to low
chroma, others, such as magenta, to high chroma, while expressions like teal do not seem to
have a particular relation to chroma (knowing however that high-chroma colors are out of
gamut in the hue range of interest, G­B). Overall consensus is low in the case of non-BCTs,
and these results are therefore not conclusive.
Chroma, consensus, and BCTs. Starting with BCTs, we get a first understanding of the
connection between consensus and chroma by looking at correlations between level of
consensus and mean chroma value. We calculated, for each BCT, the mean chroma value
of the stimuli that were described by a pure use of that BCT by at least % of the participants
who saw the stimulus, for  going in steps of 5% from a minimum of 5% consensus to the
maximum level of consensus achieved for the given BCT (for most BCTs, this was between
60% and 70%). We then looked at the correlations between those mean chroma values and
the levels of consensus. The results, reported in Table 2, showed that, for the most part, there
are moderately strong to very strong correlations between consensus and chroma.
The correlations are also in the directions one would expect them to be; in particular,
there are negative correlations for the achromatic colors.
To investigate further the connection between chroma and consensus, we used the lme4
package (Bates, Ma
¨ chler, Bolker, & Walker, 2014) for R to fit a linear mixed-effects model
with level of consensus as outcome variable and the mean chroma values as predictor
variable, looking specifically at the chromatic colors. For control purposes, we included as
a covariate the means of the Munsell values for the same levels of consensus for which we had
mean chroma values, and we included chromatic BCTs as random effects, where we used the
full random-effects structure, as recommend in Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily (2013).
A likelihood ratio test showed that this model improved significantly upon the same model
with mean chroma values removed as predictor. The fit of the full model was excellent,
with an R2 value of .91. The complete results of the model comparisons, which also
included an intercept-only model as well as a model with mean chroma values as the only
Jraissati and Douven 11
predictor, are given in Table 3. Figure 3 plots the marginal effects on consensus of chroma
and value, as estimated in the full model.
It is seen from the table that the full model does best across all standard model comparison
criteria. In this model, there was a significant relationship between chroma and consensus:
B ¼ 10.75, SE ¼ 3.28, t(6.11) ¼ 3.27, p ¼ .017. This means that, keeping all else constant, for
the chromatic colors, an increase in mean chroma of 1 point is associated with an average
increase of close to 11% in consensus; or in other words, moving from the center of the
Munsell system toward its surface, for every point in chroma, we get closer to that surface, we
see, on average, and keeping all else fixed, an increase in consensus in the use of chromatic
BCTs of 11%. The control variable--mean Munsell values--was not significant in this
model: B ¼ À30.00, SE ¼ 17.59, t(7.89) ¼ À1.71, p ¼ .13.
We followed this up by fitting linear models for each of the BCTs separately. The overall
picture was consistent with the previous findings: In these models, chroma was typically a
highly significant predictor for consensus, with value also sometimes being significant. For
most BCTs, the fit of the corresponding model, as expressed by the R2 statistic, is excellent,
mostly above .8 and for five BCTs (green, yellow, red, purple, and pink) even above .9. The
Mathematica notebook contains the full regression tables. Appendix B shows plots of the
linear models to exhibit the effect of chroma on each color individually.

The Mathematica notebook contains additional machinery to visualize the relation
between consensus level and chroma. The function animConsPure in Section 4 of the
notebook allows one to create animations, with stimuli being shown almost seamlessly for
increasing values of the consensus threshold , for any of the BCTs one wishes. Running
these animations confirms that, for virtually all BCTs, stimuli meeting higher consensus levels
tend to be located more toward the surface of the space. The function densPlotPure in
Section 5 of the notebook produces a three-dimensional density plot for any given BCT.
For both functions, it is to be kept in mind that they use CIELUV space, which is not the
same as the Munsell system, the latter being assumed in our statistical analyses. Nevertheless,
the higher the Munsell chroma value of a stimulus, the further out, from the center of
CIELUV space, it tends to be. The Mathematica notebook also contains counterparts to
animConsPure and densPlotPure for impure references to BCTs.
To summarize, our statistical analysis of naming patterns reveals the chroma of a color
stimulus to be a major determinant for whether or not people use a BCT to describe the
stimulus. The visual presentations of the Munsell system that we provided in Modal and
Majority Responses section are only partial, necessarily limited to some value levels or some
hues that were selected at random, for illustrative purposes. Nevertheless, a similar pattern is
observed in the case of most pure BCTs.
Taking consensus as a measure of membership--in the manner of, for instance, Hampton
(2007), Douven (2016), and Douven et al. (2017)--our results show that color categories have
structures that are graded not only along the hue and value dimensions, as was already
known from previous studies, but also along the chroma dimension.
Chroma, consensus, and non-BCTs. We conducted a mixed-effects models analysis similar to the
one reported in Chroma, Consensus, and Basic Color Terms section, and in light of the
aforementioned observations, we were not surprised to find that neither Munsell chroma
nor Munsell value was a significant predictor of level of consensus for non-BCTs. (The R
code is in the Supplementary Materials, for readers interested in the details. We also fitted
ordinary least squares models for the most frequently used non-BCTs individually. Plots of
four of those models are shown in Appendix B, for comparison with the plots of the ordinary
least squares models for the individual BCTs. Regression tables of the models for the ten
most frequent non-BCTs can be found in the Mathematica notebook.) Thus, in view of our
data, the answer to Kay et al.'s (1997) question of whether non-BCTs form unbroken

volumes carving up the inner layers of Munsell must be negative. Figure A6 (representing
consensus in the use of the ten most frequent non-BCTs in a chroma­value diagram at 5
different hues) and Figure A3 (representing consensus in the use of the 10 most frequent non-
BCTs in a hue­chroma diagram at 3 levels of value) taken together suggest that non-BCTs
reach overall low consensus levels, with only few of them appearing to have a rather
continuous, nonscattered, extension; that is, most non-BCTs extend over somewhat broken
volumes, with no clearly delimited area where consensus tends to peak.
Discussion and Concluding Remarks
This study was meant as a straightforward exploration of English speakers' naming behavior
of the Munsell system, and most importantly, its inner layers. We had two main questions:
First, how do people name the inner parts of Munsell? Second, if BCTs are overwhelmingly
used at the surface of the system, how would their structure vary along the chroma
dimension? To this end, we designed a naming experiment as similar as possible to the
WCS, with the main difference that it also included a large number of intermediately and
poorly saturated Munsell colors. Moreover, the free naming was not constrained in any way,
and people were not instructed not to use complex expressions if they so desired, although
they were encouraged to be concise.
Our study confirmed that English speakers overwhelmingly use BCTs in their color
naming. Our study also confirmed that most BCTs refer to saturated colors. Frequency of
use of BCTs, and especially pure BCTs, was highest in the middle to high chroma levels, and
generally consensus increased with chroma. Although this behavior was expected on the basis
of previous literature (Boynton & Olson, 1987; Olkkonen et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2005;
Rosch, 1972; Sturges & Whitfield, 1995), it was never systematically observed in a large-scale
naming study involving colors with low saturation.
Insofar as the use of non-BCTs in our study goes, it is characterized by a rather low
consensus across chroma levels. A few expressions seem to manifest a peak of consensus
with decreasing chroma, such as peach, the consensus of which peaks at C6, and tan, at C4.
Most non-BCTs have a rather diffuse extension. We were hoping to observe a different
behavior at low saturation, but these observations do not come as a surprise (Boynton &
Olson, 1987; MacLaury, 2007; Sturges & Whitfield, 1995). It is important to note that we do
not take our results to offer a list of reified categories currently in use in English. What our
results suggest is that, given a set of colors that vary across levels of chroma, presented once,
individually, and in random order, participants tend to use BCTs more often and more
consensually. They also use them more in relation to saturated colors.
Nonetheless, and even if their extensions are rather patchy and scattered, we do observe
the use of several non-BCTs in our study. Does the fact that some of these terms (tan and
peach) reach their highest consensus levels at low chroma mean that non-BCTs should be
expected to categorize less saturated parts of color space?
This is precisely one of the issues we set out to examine. One observation that sheds some
light on it is that (what we here called) basic and nonbasic categories seem to overlap rather
than jointly partition the space. This observation would need to be verified in future naming
studies, but meanwhile it raises interesting questions and possibilities. First, are these
overlapping and less consensual expressions here labeled non-BCTs for convenience, ``not
basic'' in the sense that they are subordinate categories? Do they have extensions that are
included in the extensions of BCTs, or are they hyponyms (see the basic color terms criteria in
Berlin & Kay, 1969)? For a color to be magenta seems to imply that it is of pinkish color, but
also highly saturated. Magenta could perhaps in this sense denote a ``kind of pink.'' But this is
14 i-Perception 9(4)
not the case for the other non-BCTs examined in this study. The extension of teal overlaps
with those of green and blue at low chroma. Teal seems to pick up both colors that are not
obviously blue and colors that are not obviously green (perhaps because of their relatively low
chroma), as much as it picks up colors that are ambiguously blue or green at all chroma levels
(see again Figure A1; also Lindsey & Brown, 2014). Teal is therefore not a kind of blue or a
kind of green. The extensions of peach and tan are also not entirely included within that of any
BCT. At high value, peach overlaps with yellow and pink, and at medium value, it overlaps
with orange and brown. In other words, peach behaves differently than any of these categories
both on hue and value. As for tan, it overlaps with orange and brown at medium value, medium
to low chroma, but more toward the YG hue range than peach. It would indeed seem that the
overlaps we observe here might correspond to what others have called coextension (e.g.,
MacLaury, 1997), where coextension is a semantic relationship that does ``not fit our
preconceptions of synonymy, near synonymy, inclusion, or complementation'' (MacLaury,
1997, p. 111).
It would be reasonable to conclude that the non-BCTs in this study are used to mark an
aspect of color experience that is not captured by BCTs. What different aspects of our color
experience do non-BCTs and BCTs mostly mark? An intuitive answer would be that
BCTs (excluding brown) mark hue, for the most part. That is, what distinguishes one BCT
from another is in most cases its hue. Non-BCTs, on the other hand, seem to mark more than
the particular hue of a color experience, picking up chroma as well as value variations (see the
notions of ``desaturated-complex'' and ``saturated-complex'' in MacLaury, 2007). Is this the
reason why use of BCTs increases with chroma? Chroma increases hue contrasts, and if BCTs
mostly mark hue differences, an increase in chroma would be expected to lead to an increased
use of BCTs.
An interesting follow-up question is this: If BCTs name most saturated colors
because these favor hue contrasts, would participants still use BCTs most consensually to
name the (relatively) most saturated colors of a color set that is overall poorly saturated? Or,
on the contrary, would the relatively most saturated colors of an overall poorly saturated
color set tend to be named by BCTs less frequently? In other words, might the relationship of
BCTs to chroma be relative to the color set in use? Such is a possible sense in which BCTs
would essentially be a way to linguistically mark distinctive hues. And how would non-BCTs
relate to BCTs in such a set?
From this perspective, the expectation that non-BCTs would carve up poorly saturated
parts of Munsell like BCTs carve up highly saturated parts of the system in a color set
featuring high- and low-chroma colors, seems to result from a mistaken hypothesis: Non-
BCTs and BCTs do not seem to relate to chroma in similar ways. Perhaps people's
favoring the use of BCTs for most saturated colors leads to non-BCTs being more
visible at low chroma. However, what relation non-BCTs bear to low chroma, and
whether such terms are truly preferred for naming low-chroma colors, remain open
questions.
We hope the data we here share will encourage much needed future studies involving,
among other things, response times and within-subject consistency measures that would
allow to assess how salient non-BCTs are to the individuals who use them. Meanwhile,
this study furthers our understanding of the lexicalization of color. Given the connection
between consensus and graded membership that many researchers assume (as mentioned
previously), the study also advances our understanding of category structure and graded
membership and can be useful in testing various extant categorization models
(e.g., Decock & Douven, 2014; Douven, 2018; Douven & Decock, 2017; Douven, Decock,

2. Saturation and chroma are not exactly equivalent notions. According to the Commission
Internationale de l'E
´clairage (CIE), chroma is the ``colourfulness of an area judged as a
proportion of the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly
transmitting'' (http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/139). In other words, in Munsell, chroma consists of the
distance from one hue­value point to the central achromatic axis, at the given value, whereas
according to the CIE, saturation is the ``colourfulness of an area judged in proportion to its
brightness'' (http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/1136). It is therefore the relative colorfulness of that light,
independently of its relation to whitishness (see http://munsell.com/color-blog/difference-chroma-
saturation/). In spaces such as CIELUV, saturation can be calculated in a way that corresponds to
human experience. This study uses Munsell stimuli, but for illustrations (in particular,
visualizations), we mostly rely on CIELUV space, for reasons discussed later. Given that the
main color system used in this study is Munsell, we use the Munsell notation for value, hue, and
chroma by default. In specific passages where other color systems are referred to, we use the
corresponding nomenclature.
It is also to be noted that by maximum chroma, we mean maximum chroma available in 1969 (date of
the Berlin and Kay study) and 1975 (date at which the WCS was first instigated), knowing that with
technological advances, Munsell chips have become increasingly saturated over the years.

Appendix A. Mode Maps
Figure A1 shows mode maps featuring frequency of response as a proportion of total number
of responses for the chip, along the hue (x) and chroma (y) dimensions, including all
expressions used at V3 (top), V6 (middle), and V9 (bottom). Two charts per value level

are provided. The top chart represents the term that was used most frequently to name a
particular chip and the frequency at which it was used. The bottom chart offers a
visualization of the naming frequency, with brightest patterns standing for lower
frequency. Frequency information is given in intervals of 0.1 up till 0.6--so [0.0,0.1),
[0.1,0.2), and so on, till [0.5,0.6), after which the last interval is [0.6,1.0] (given the sparsity
of frequencies greater than 0.7). Figures A2 and A3 are like Figure A1 except that the shown
mode maps include only expressions that qualify as pure BCTs and pure non-BCTs,
respectively. Figures A4 to A6 are similar to the previous figures, the difference being that
they show mode maps for specific hues, to wit, 10B, 10P, 10R, 10Y, and 10R. Figure A4
shows mode maps for all expressions used, Figure A5 shows mode maps strictly for
expressions that qualify as pure BCTs, and Figure A6 does the same for expressions
qualifying as pure non-BCTs. Conventions for the visualization are as in Figures A1 to
A3. The gray area indicates the gamut limitation. Blanks mean that the color was not
named. Color patches marked x are the ones to which the response was discarded (see
Materials and Procedure section, and the supplement on discarded colors).
Appendix B. Linear Models for Individual Colors
In Chroma, Consensus, and Basic Color Terms section, we mentioned that we followed up
the mixed-effects model analysis of the BCT data by fitting ordinary least squares models for
each BCT separately. In this appendix, we present the plots of the linear models with chroma
as the only predictor of consensus. Figure B1 shows the results in which chroma is a positive
predictor of consensus. Figure B2 shows the results in which chroma is a negative predictor.
Figure B3 shows the ordinary least squares models with chroma as only predictor for the
consensus concerning the four most frequent non-BCTs. From these plots, it is already
evident that chroma is a poor predictor in those models. For further details, see the
Mathematica notebook.
