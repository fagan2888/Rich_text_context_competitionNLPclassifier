Abstract
In 1996, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated the development of the Medicare
Health Outcomes Survey (HOS). It is the first national survey to measure the quality of life and functional
health status of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care. The program seeks to gather valid and
reliable health status data in Medicare managed care for use in quality improvement activities, public
reporting, plan accountability and improving health outcomes based on competition. The context that led
to the development of the HOS was formed by the convergence of the following factors: 1) a recognized
need to monitor the performance of managed care plans, 2) technical expertise and advancement in the
areas of quality measurement and health outcomes assessment, 3) the existence of a tested functional
health status assessment tool (SF-36®)1, which was valid for an elderly population, 4) CMS leadership, and
5) political interest in quality improvement.
Since 1998, there have been six baseline surveys and four follow up surveys. CMS, working with its
partners, performs the following tasks as part of the HOS program: 1) Supports the technical/scientific
development of the HOS measure, 2) Certifies survey vendors, 3) Collects Health Plan Employer Data and
Information Set(HEDIS®)2 HOS data, 4) Cleans, scores, and disseminates annual rounds of HOS data,
public use files and reports to CMS, Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), Medicare+Choice
Organizations (M+COs), and other stakeholders, 5) Trains M+COs and QIOs in the use of functional
status measures and best practices for improving care, 6) Provides technical assistance to CMS, QIOs,
M+COs and other data users, and 7) Conducts analyses using HOS data to support CMS and HHS
priorities.
CMS has recently sponsored an evaluation of the HOS program, which will provide the information
necessary to enhance the future administration of the program. Information collected to date reveals that
the HOS program is a valuable tool that provides a rich set of data that is useful for quality monitoring and
improvement efforts. To enhance the future of the HOS program, many stakeholders recommend the
implementation of incentives to encourage the use of the data, while others identify the need to monitor
the health status of plan disenrollees.
Overall, the HOS program represents an important vehicle for collecting outcomes data from Medicare
beneficiaries. The new Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (2003)
mandates the collection and use of data for quality, outcomes measurement, program administration, and
facilitating consumer choice. Consequently, it is important that the HOS program effectively meet this
mandate.

Introduction
Medicare managed care plans are an important source of
health care services for beneficiaries. At present, 5.3 mil-
lion beneficiaries receive care in these settings, of whom
4.6 million are enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans (since
renamed Medicare Advantage plans, effective January 1,
2006). The number enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans
is projected to increase to 13.6 million by 2010, given the
recent passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act [1]. Thus, an esti-
mated 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will receive
care in managed care settings by 2010. The quality of care
provided in managed care settings is a critical and growing
issue.
A managed care organization's ability to provide quality
health care is particularly important to the Medicare pro-
gram. Medicare provides services to 34.6 million elderly
and six million younger beneficiaries with disabilities [1].
A substantial share of beneficiaries are poor, with 40 per-
cent having incomes of 200 percent of the federal poverty
level or lower. Chronic conditions are prevalent, with 57
percent of non-institutionalized beneficiaries self report-
ing arthritis, 55 percent reporting hypertension and 37
percent reporting heart disease [2]. More than one-third
need assistance with at least one activity of daily living [3],
while 28 percent self reports their health status as fair or
poor [2]. Thus, Medicare enrollees are often those vulner-
able to problems with quality in managed care settings [4-
7].
CMS's current vision involves enhancing "quality and effi-
ciency in an evolving health care system" [8]. Some of
CMS's specific goals include securing and enhancing
health and satisfaction, creating a system of high quality
care, and providing guidance for the overall health care
market to improve beneficiaries' health [8]. CMS has
made considerable progress in becoming a value-based
purchaser of health care by pursuing high quality care for
beneficiaries at a reasonable cost. Value-based purchasing
includes several strategies directed at improving the qual-
ity of care, encouraging the efficient use of resources, and
improving information to beneficiaries to assist them in
making choices. Performance measurement is a critical
component for all these purchasing strategies.
In 1996, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ini-
tiated the Medicare HOS program. The Medicare HOS is a
survey that measures a health plan's ability to maintain or
improve the physical and mental health of its Medicare
beneficiaries over time. It is the first national survey to
measure the health related quality of life and functional
health status of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in man-
aged care [9]. The HOS consists of the SF-36®, questions
concerning Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)3, chronic
health conditions, demographics, and survey administra-
tion. The use of the HOS to collect health outcomes data
mirrors a national trend in quality improvement activities
to utilize outcome-based measures of quality. The goal of
the HOS has been to gather valid and reliable health sta-
tus data in Medicare managed care for use in quality
improvement activities, public reporting, plan accounta-
bility and improving health outcomes based on competi-
tion [10]. The HOS has the potential of becoming a model
of government leadership in our nation's quest to
improve the quality of health care for all Americans.
CMS has sponsored a program evaluation of the HOS, a
CAHPS®-HOS Integration study, and analytical studies of
the HOS data. The results of these studies will provide
CMS the information it needs to improve the future
administration of HOS. The current evaluation of HOS,
which will conclude in Fall 2004, includes three compo-
nents: 1) a description of the context of HOS develop-
ment, 2) an examination of the HOS instrument and
operational protocols, and 3) an assessment of the policy
issues concerning the utility of HOS data. The contextual
analysis presented here is one component of the total
evaluation.
This paper explores the historical context that led to the
development and implementation of the HOS program; it
also describes the HOS and examines its administration,
its role and function within CMS, and the direction that
the program may take in the future. The information for
this paper was obtained through a review of the published
health services literature, national reports, unpublished
CMS documents and reports, and interviews with key
CMS staff members (current and former), HOS partners,
and Technical Expert Panel (TEP) members.
Background
Quality concerns, during the late 1980s and early 1990s,
led to heightened interest in establishing effective mecha-
nisms for measuring and, ultimately, ensuring quality in
health care. Following Donabedian's widely recognized
paradigm (1988), a variety of methods for defining and
measuring health care quality have evolved [11]. From the
use of process and structural measures of care, to the use
of more quality of life and functional health outcomes-
based measures, evaluators have sought to develop and
implement the most effective methods for assessing
health care quality and performance.

During the time of HOS development, there was an
increased interest in measuring outcomes of health care.
The use of outcome measures in quality improvement
efforts stems, in part, from a desire to focus on the impact
of care on patients [12]. Berwick (2002) asserts that the
experience of patients should be the ultimate source of
defining quality. Berwick views the purpose of the U.S.
health care system as enhancing the functioning and
health status of citizens by decreasing the burden resulting
from disease, injury and disability [13]. Rogers (2003)
notes that one of the motivations to pursue functional sta-
tus assessment from the beginning was to try to inject
awareness of outcomes into the medical system. There
was an interest in moving the focus from "treating dis-
eases" to "treating patients. [14]"
Traditional health outcome measures have included phys-
iologic measures as well as mortality. More recently, a
variety of tools to measure additional dimensions of
health and well being of importance to individuals have
been developed [15][16]. As described by Bierman and
colleagues, "health status measures assess the net effect of
one or all health problems and treatments on multiple
domains of health" [15]. Those health status measures
that are generic should consider function across a number
of domains as well as be applicable to various health
states [15].
CMS activities
CMS like other large purchasers wanted to establish a
manner in which to measure the quality that managed
care organizations were providing their beneficiaries.
According to the 1998 President's Advisory Commission
on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care
Industry Report, a key element of improving health care
quality is the Nation's ability to measure the quality of
care and provide easily understood, comparable informa-
tion on the performance of the industry [17].
Many process and clinical care performance measures
existed in the 1990s; however, noticeably lacking were
appropriate measures of health outcomes. The Office of
the Inspector General (1997), as well as Bailit (1997a, b)
released reports encouraging CMS to adopt an outcomes-
based performance assessment model that emphasizes
the use of outcome-oriented performance data [18-20]. It
was felt that an emphasis on the use of outcomes-oriented
performance data would be consistent with the goals of
value-based purchasing [21]. Stevic commented, "In the
health care industry, everyone was frustrated with meas-
urement. We had been doing measurement for a long
time....we were doing a lot of process measures and no
one was satisfied that we had the right informa-
tion....[22]" According to Jencks, "CMS needed to develop
an appropriate health outcome measure because one did
not already exist and there was not likely to be one devel-
oped by someone other than CMS in the near term" [23].
In 1996, CMS decided to partner with NCQA to develop a
functional health status assessment tool to be used as a
health plan performance measure for Medicare beneficiar-
ies. The Medicare HOS was created to provide health out-
comes data as a performance measure of Medicare
managed care plans. To justify the emphasis on Medicare
enrollees in managed care, NCQA representatives indi-
cated that "the focus has been on managed care because
the accountability movement started with managed care.
Managed care was promoting itself as an accountable
entity that would lead to better care outcomes and the
government wanted to show that managed care was valu-
able..... Also, people thought managed care would grow in
Medicare" [9].
According to Kang, functional health status was selected
as CMS's outcome measure of choice because it was of
greatest interest to Medicare beneficiaries [24]. Paul stated
that "the decision to use functional health status was the
right one [25]. It reflects the agency's strategic objective of
being patient-centered" [25]. Additionally, there was evi-
dence that complex issues such as chronic illness, co-mor-
bidity, and functional impairment are particular
problems among the elderly and present distinct chal-
lenges to this population. It was believed that a functional
status measure was an important outcome of care, due to
the complexities involved in the health of older adults,
and because of the growing concern about how managed
care would affect these conditions and this population's
subsequent functional status [15].
Haffer maintains that, "During the Clinton administra-
tion, the agency thought of itself as a beneficiary-centered,
value-based purchaser of services, and tried to do things to
measure the value we [CMS] were getting for the services
we [CMS] were purchasing on behalf of the beneficiaries.
These performance measures filled a need because we
[CMS] could now look at what we [CMS] were spending
and compare plans based on standardized, scientifically
sound performance measures. [28]" Bierman et al. (2001)
said that quality of care is a complex concept and meas-
ures such as the HOS examine an important dimension of
quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries [15].
Although the planning and development of the HOS
began in 1996, it was the 1997 Balanced Budget Act that
gave the HOS a clear mandate. Among its requirements
was the establishment of quality requirements for health
plans enrolling Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
According to the legislation, performance measurement
reporting requirements for Medicare managed care are
authorized to promote quality improvement. Section
Health and Quality of Life Outcomes 2004, 2:33 http://www.hqlo.com/content/2/1/33

1851 (d) (4)(D)(iii) of Title XVIII of the Social Security
Act (the Act) authorizes CMS to review the quality of care
provided to people with Medicare. Section 1876 (I) of the
Act sets several criteria for managed care contracts. These
statutorily mandated provisions have been implemented
in the regulations at CFR 417.470, et seq., which reference
42 CFR 417.126(a), which states that each contracted
managed care plan must have an effective procedure to
develop, compile, evaluate, and report to CMS, to its
enrollees, and to the general public, developments in the
health status of its enrollees to the extent practical.
CMS established a technical expert panel (TEP) to guide
the development, implementation and operations of the
HOS [8]. The TEP recommended that the HOS become a
component of Medicare HEDIS® and that the SF-36® be
used as the foundation of the measure. The SF-36®, a phys-
ical and mental health status measure, was used in the
Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) [7] and has a history of
use in estimating relative disease burden for numerous
conditions [27]. The SF-36® has been used in both specific
populations such as the elderly and disabled, as well as in
the general population [10]. ]. The tool has been used to
determine the effectiveness of various treatments such as
hip and knee replacement and heart valve surgery
[28][29], as well as the burden of various illnesses such as
cancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS on populations [27].
Commenting on the reason the SF-36® was chosen for the
HOS, Ware [30] noted that the SF-36® was the most widely
used health status measure at the time [of HOS develop-
ment]...and was found to be reliable and valid for use
with the elderly and other demographic groups. The SF-
36® had good psychometric properties and had been peer-
reviewed. Additionally, both a user's manual and norma-
tive SF-36® data were available.
Although the most widely used generic health status
measure at the time of developing the HOS instrument,
debate existed about its use with elderly individuals [31-
33], As discussed by McHorney (1996), there are "...prac-
tical and psychometric issues that can differentially affect
the performance of generic health status tools in cross-sec-
tional and longitudinal studies of elderly persons, includ-
ing mode-of-administration effects, floor and ceiling
effects, and score stability versus internal consistency"
[16]. Two additional issues are relevant for longitudinal
studies ­ selective mortality and proxy reports [16]. Beir-
man and colleagues (2001) raise similar concerns related
to administration and survey response [15]. For example,
while the SF-36® takes approximately ten minutes to com-
plete, it likely takes longer for participants with less than
a high school education [16], older participants [6] and
participants with cognitive impairment [34]. However,
the previously mentioned issues are not specific to the SF-
36®, and does not seem to rise to the level unacceptability
for use with a geriatric population [11][31][33]. These
issues will be important to address in the broader HOS
evaluation, discussed below.
The HOS program
CMS, responsible for leadership, oversight, coordination,
and successful implementation of the national Medicare
HOS Program (formerly the Health of Seniors Survey),
formed partnerships with organizations that had skills
and experience in the areas of health outcomes and per-
formance measurement. The team of HOS partners and
technical experts are described in Tables 1 and 2.
The instrument
The HOS is based on a longitudinal cohort research
design, in which a baseline and 2-year follow-up surveys
are administered to a sample of beneficiaries in each plan.
The survey is primarily a mailed questionnaire that is sent
to selected participants, with a series of reminder post-
cards and telephone interviews among non-respondents
and incomplete survey respondents in efforts to increase
the survey response rate4. The HOS survey instrument
consists of three primary components: 1) the SF-36®, 2)
case-mix and risk-adjustment questions, and 3) demo-
graphic and other questions required by the 1997 Bal-
anced Budget Act [9]. The SF-36®, as previously noted, is a
multipurpose short-form general health survey, which
provides eight scale scores of physical and mental health
attributes, as well as two summary measures of physical
and mental health status, the Physical Component Sum-
mary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS),
both of which are weighted combinations of all eight scale
scores [35] (Table 3).
The responses to the SF-36® are scored as eight Likert
scales, summarized using standard weights, and then
normed using 1998 US general population data to pro-
duce the PCS and MCS scales (see both the SF-36® Health
Survey Manual and Interpretation Guide and SF-36® Phys-
ical and Mental Health Summary Scales: A Manual for
Users of Version 1 for details) [40][35]. Each beneficiary
who remains in the health plan in which he or she was
originally sampled is measured twice, at baseline and
again at follow-up; thus, the beneficiary serves as his/her
own control. All respondents who die during the two-year
follow-up period also are included in the follow-up anal-
ysis. Because there are many differences among individual
survey respondents based on age and initial health status,
for example, the mortality results and PCS and MCS two-
year change scores are risk-adjusted5. Thus, plan-to-plan
comparisons of health outcomes are adjusted for differ-
ences in case-mix, using available data on characteristics
such as chronic conditions, age, ethnicity, gender, and
education, among others. Logistic regression models
which incorporate techniques for missing data estimation

are used for risk-adjustment; the change in two-year
health status is determined as: better than expected, same
as expected6, or worse than expected [10]. The a priori pri-
mary outcomes were "alive and PCS same or better than
expected" and "MCS same or better than expected".
Program administration
The HOS survey is administered to a random sample of
1,000 Medicare beneficiaries from each M+CO at
baseline7 [10]. Beneficiaries are deemed eligible if they
were continuously enrolled for at least 6 months in the
same plan and do not have End Stage Renal Disease
(ESRD). The survey is administered at baseline, and again
two years later; a new cohort is sampled each year [41].
Plans contract with an NCQA-certified vendor to conduct
the survey once the sample has been selected and
approved by CMS through its contractor, Research Trian-
gle Institute (RTI) International, a subcontractor to
NCQA.. Vendors receive HOS survey administration train-
ing annually from NCQA. Vendors then administer the
surveys in accordance with the applicable NCQA HEDIS®
protocol. Once the survey data have been collected, they
are submitted to NCQA for consistency review. The data
are then submitted to Health Services Advisory Group
(HSAG) for cleaning, aggregation, and analysis. Following
data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis, HSAG develops
and disseminates data files and reports to CMS, Quality
Improvement Organizations (QIOs) and the health
plans8 [10].
From 1998-2003, six baseline surveys and four follow-up
surveys have been conducted, with the seventh HOS
round being fielded in 2004. CMS, working with its part-
ners, performs the following tasks as part of the HOS pro-
gram: 1) Supports the technical/scientific development of
the HOS measure, 2) Certifies survey vendors, 3) Collects
Health Plan Employer Data and Information
Set(HEDIS®)9 HOS data, 4) Cleans, scores, and dissemi-
nates annual rounds of HOS data, public use files and
reports to CMS, Quality Improvement Organizations
(QIOs), Medicare+Choice Organizations (M+COs), and
other stakeholders, 5) Trains M+COs and QIOs in the use
of functional status measures and best practices for
improving care, 6) Provides technical assistance to CMS,
QIOs, M+COs and other data users, and 7) Conducts
analyses using HOS data to support CMS and HHS prior-
ities [10].
Current utilization of HOS
As stated previously, the goal of the HOS is to collect valid
and reliable health status data in Medicare managed care
for the purposes of quality improvement activities, public
reporting, and competition based plan accountability and
health outcomes improvement [10]. The overall HOS per-
formance measurement results, by cohort are presented in
Table 4.
The data suggest some general performance improvement
over time, as the number of plans reporting better than
expected scores increased, particularly for physical health.
The number of plans with mental health scores worse

Scale Measures Questions
Physical Component Summary (PCS) Summary measure which included: PF, RP, BP, VT, SF, RE, MH, and GH.
Physical Functioning (PF) Ten questions ask respondents to indicate the extent to which their health limits them in performing
physical activities.
Role-Physical (RP) Four questions assess whether respondents' physical health limits them in the kind of work or usual
activities they perform.
Bodily Pain (BP) Two questions determine frequency of pain and extent to which pain interferes with normal activities.
General Health (GH) Five questions ask respondents to rate their current health status overall, their susceptibility to
illness, and their expectations for health in the future.
Mental Component Summary (MCS) Summary measure which included: VT, MH, RE, PF, RP, BP, GH, and SF.
Vitality (VT) Four questions ask respondents to rate their well being by indicating how frequently they experience
energy and fatigue.
Mental Health (MH) Five questions ask respondents how frequently they experience feelings representing the 4 major
mental health dimensions.
Role-Emotional (RE) Three questions assess whether emotional problems have caused respondents to accomplish less in
their work or other usual activities in terms of time and performance.
Social Functioning (SF) Two questions ask respondents to indicate limitations in social functioning due to health.

than expected also declined. However, the effect of plan
attrition over time on plan performance of remaining
plans is unclear. Additionally, the majority of plans show
no change in performance over the two year period,
suggesting that the SF-36® may not sufficiently discrimi-
nate differences in plan performance.
Because of the HOS, QIOs and health plans have data that
they may use to identify opportunities to improve the
quality of care provided to their Medicare populations. In
addition, they are regularly provided information and
education on intervention strategies that may lead to
measurable improvements in health care quality.
HOS data are also used as part of CMS's Health Plan Man-
agement System (HPMS), a system of process and out-
comes health plan performance measures. These
measures are composite scores derived from HEDIS®,
Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Study (CAHPS®),10
HOS and disenrollment data, and are used by CMS to
rank plans [36]. To develop a plan composite score, the
percentile ranks for each reported HEDIS®, HOS, CAHPS®
and disenrollment indicator are averaged. Those plans
deviating substantially from the mean are considered
either high or low overall performers based on the
national comparison group. By comparing their compos-
ite scores against those of others on individual indicators,
health care organizations are able to better assess how
they compare with a national sample of their peers. The
formation of this scale may represent an interim step in
the development of a score card that could be used by
CMS, managed care plans, and others to assess health
plan performance.
HOS data may facilitate identification of beneficiaries at
risk of declining physical and mental functioning. For
example, Bierman and Clancy (2001) identified chronic
conditions that lead to poor physical functioning and
mental functioning among elderly women in Medicare
managed care plans using HOS data [37]. These condi-
tions include, for example, arthritis, coronary artery dis-
ease, diabetes, and reported feelings of depression or
sadness [37]. Using HOS data, they examined the extent
to which women of lower socioeconomic status and/or
racial/ethnic minorities were disproportionately affected
by these conditions. They suggest that HOS data can assist
in addressing these disparities.
Further, the HOS has provided CMS the ability to use
health outcomes data for payment adjustments. CMS is
now using the ADL data from the HOS to calculate a
frailty adjustor to set payment for Social Health Mainte-
nance Organizations. A variant of the HOS, the Program
of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) Health Survey,
is being used to calculate a frailty adjustor for PACE plans
and for demonstrations that target frail Medicare benefici-
aries [38].
HOS data have also been used in research. To date, eleven
research reports have been made available on the Medi-
care HOS website, covering topics such as how perform-
ance measurement results are calculated, and the health
status of younger individuals with disabilities enrolled in
M+C plans. These reports are available at http://
www.cms.hhs.gov/surveys/hos/hosresearch.asp. The HOS
website also includes a list of publications appearing in
scientific journals.
Researchers have used HOS data to examine the func-
tional status of chronically ill Medicare managed care
enrollees to assess the need for disease management pro-
grams. A study also reviewed the disease management
demonstration projects sponsored by CMS, and discussed
how such interventions may help enhance the functional
status of chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries over time.
Through exploring the change in SF-36® scores over time,
it has been found that the presence of chronic disease has
a negative impact on both physical and mental health of
enrollees over a two year period [26]. Preventing the onset
of disease is the best manner in which to maintain opti-

mal health. However, once a disease has surfaced, there
must be interventions in place to manage the disease.
Results from the HOS data indicate that opportunities
exist to enhance health outcomes in this population [15].
Efforts by CMS, such as the incorporation of guidelines
into HOS documents encouraging the use of evidence-
based interventions to prevent and manage chronic
illness, convey CMS's goal of helping plans use HOS data
to improve the health and functional status of enrollees
[39].
The HOS has also been used as a vehicle to explore emerg-
ing and/or geriatric quality care related health issues and
concerns. The HOS instruments have included questions
concerning health services utilization, retirement commu-
nity living, smoking frequency and cessation, healthy
days, management of urinary incontinence, among others
[10]. The healthy days questions from the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Sur-
veillance System (BRFSS) were added to allow a link
between HOS and BRFSS results, facilitating comparison
across federal initiatives. The management of urinary
incontinence questions were added in 2003 as a new
HEDIS® measure [10].
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003
Public Law 108­173, The Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, provides
HOS a clear mandate and focus. Specifically, Section 722
specifies requirements for CMS and Medicare Advantage
(MA) organizations that must be undertaken to pursue
quality health care for Medicare beneficiaries. Section 722
requires that each MA organization comply with the
following:
1. Have an ongoing quality improvement program for the
purpose of improving the care provided to enrollees in
each MA plan offered by such organizations.
2. Have a chronic care improvement program, which con-
sist of having a method of monitoring and identifying
enrollees with multiple or sufficiently severe chronic con-
ditions that meet established criteria.
3. Provide for collection, analysis, and reporting of meas-
ures of health outcomes and other indices of quality [42].
It also requires CMS to establish appropriate regulatory
requirements for the following:
1. The collection, analysis, and reporting of data that per-
mits the measurement of health outcomes and other indi-
ces of quality for MA organizations; and,
2. Dictates that no new quality, outcomes, and beneficiary
satisfaction data to facilitate consumer choice and pro-
gram administration shall be collected that were not col-
lected by CMS as of November 1, 2003. However, CMS
may only change the types of data that are required to be
submitted by MA(s) after submitting to Congress a report
on the reasons for such changes that was prepared in
consultation with MA organizations and private accredit-
ing bodies [42].
The HOS is now the only approved patient-based health
outcomes measure for MA quality improvement and per-
formance monitoring. In addition, HOS provides MA
organizations data that they can use as a means of identi-
fying and monitoring enrollees with chronic conditions as
part of their chronic care quality improvement programs.
Using HOS data in this manner however, may be limited
to some extent by the underlying sampling strategy, which
was designed as a simple random sample with each MA
organization as the unit of analysis. Given the restriction
imposed by the new legislation concerning the develop-
ment of new measures, HOS will likely be CMS's primary
health outcomes measure of MA plans for the foreseeable
future.
Conclusion
Articles and studies published to date suggest that CMS's
leadership and innovation with respect to the develop-
ment of the HOS represented an important initial step
toward the development of one major component of an
information infrastructure needed to monitor and
improve the quality of health care. Now fully developed,
HOS's data and administration are under study. Inter-
views with HOS partners and stakeholders have revealed
that the majority feel that the HOS provides a rich and
unique set of valid, reliable, and actionable data. How-
ever, interviewees have offered some additional recom-
mendations to improve the HOS, which include: 1)
tracking the health status of plan disenrollees, and 2) cre-
ating greater incentives for plans and QIOs to use the HOS
data.
CMS values programs and measurement tools that facili-
tate improvements in health care for its beneficiaries. The
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Moderni-
zation Act of 2003 mandate the measurement of health
outcomes and restrict the development of new measures.
Consequently, HOS is CMS's primary vehicle to collect
outcomes data, particularly patient-based functional
health status measures. The evaluation of the efficacy of
the HOS program will provide CMS with essential infor-
mation to improve the HOS and to determine the best
way for HOS to effectively meet this new legislative
mandate.
