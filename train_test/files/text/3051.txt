Diabetes Mellitus and Nontraumatic Lower
Extremity Amputation in Black and White Americans
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic
Follow-up Study, 1971-1992
Helaine E. Resnick, PhD, MPH; Paola Valsania, MD; Caroline L. Phillips, MS
Background: The comparative long-term risk of non-
traumatic lower extremity amputation (LEA) in black and
white Americans, 2 groups with strikingly different rates
of diabetes mellitus, is not known.
Objective: To examine the 20-year incidence of LEA
in relation to race and diabetes mellitus.
Methods: The 14 407 subjects in the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Fol-
low-up Study were observed prospectively between 1971
and 1992. Prevalent diabetes mellitus was ascertained at
the baseline examination, and incident diabetes melli-
tus, during follow-up. Lower extremity amputation was
ascertained from hospital discharge records. Cox regres-
sion analysis was used to estimate associations between
race, diabetes mellitus, and risk of first LEA.
Results: During the study period, 158 LEAs occurred
among 108 subjects. While black subjects constituted
15.2% of the cohort, they represented 27.8% of the sub-
jects with amputation (P = .002). The 20-year age-
adjusted rate ratio of first LEAs for black subjects­white
subjects was 2.14. Regression analyses confirmed the
importance of diabetes mellitus as a key LEA risk factor.
The association between prevalent diabetes mellitus and
LEA risk was substantially higher (relative risk [RR],
7.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.61-11.22) than
that for incident diabetes mellitus (RR, 3.15 [CI, 1.84-
5.37]), highlighting the importance of diabetes mellitus
duration on LEA risk. While preliminary analyses
adjusted for age and diabetes indicated a significant
association between race and LEA risk (RR, 1.93 [95%
CI, 1.26-2.96]), the effect of race diminished (RR, 1.49
[95% CI, 0.95-2.34]) following adjustment for educa-
tion, hypertension, and smoking.
Conclusions: Althoughblacksubjectsexperiencedhigher
age- and diabetes mellitus­adjusted rates of amputation
than their white counterparts, a combination of social and
environmental factors may account for the apparent eth-
nic difference. More research into nonbiological factors
associated with LEA may reduce the occurrence of these
procedures in both black and white individuals.

LOWER EXTREMITY amputa-
tion (LEA) is a costly and dis-
abling complication of diabe-
tes mellitus that results from
the individual and combined
pathophysiologic effects of peripheral arte-
rial disease and peripheral neuropathy.1-5
Despite the high prevalence of type 2 dia-
betesmellitusintheUnitedStatesandother
industrialized nations, there are no long-
term, broadly generalizable studies of inci-
dent LEAs in individuals with and without
diabetes mellitus from the same popula-
tion, nor are there population-based rates
of LEA in black and white Americans, 2
groups with strikingly different rates of dia-
betes mellitus. We performed this study to
characterizethelong-termincidenceofLEA
in the United States in relation to race and
diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that
black Americans would be at higher risk of
LEA than white Americans, regardless of
their diabetes mellitus status.
RESULTS
At baseline, 852 subjects reported having
been told by a physician that they had dia-
betes mellitus, and 174 of these also had
urine test results positive for glucose. Ad-
ditionally, 221 subjects who did not report
diabetes mellitus also had glucose in their
urineatbaseline.Thus,1073subjects(7.4%
of the NHEFS cohort) were considered to
be prevalent cases of diabetes mellitus.
Following the baseline interview,
1167 subjects developed diabetes melli-
tus and were considered to be incident
cases. Thus, 2240 subjects (15.5% of the
cohort) had either prevalent or incident
diabetes mellitus during the study. Of the
14 407 subjects in the cohort, 108 (0.7%)
had at least 1 LEA during follow-up, and
a total of 158 amputations were per-
formed on these individuals.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
STUDY DESIGN
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I
Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) involved a co-
hort of 14 407 subjects aged between 25 and 74 years at
baseline examination between 1971 and 1975. The cohort
consisted of 12 036 white and 2199 black subjects as well
as 172 subjects of other races. The baseline interview in-
cluded questions on medical conditions previously diag-
nosed by a physician, smoking history, and education. The
baseline medical examination included measurements of
height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, sub-
scapular and triceps skinfold thicknesses, and a urine glu-
cose test (semiquantitative). Body mass index (BMI, cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by the height in
meterssquared)wascalculatedfromsubjects'baselineheight
and weight and was used as a measure of relative weight.
The ratio of the subscapular and triceps skinfolds was used
as an indicator of fat distribution.6,7 Subjects were classi-
fied as hypertensive at baseline if they reported taking medi-
cations for high blood pressure or had a systolic blood pres-
sure of 160 mm Hg or higher and/or a diastolic blood
pressure of 95 mm Hg or higher. Follow-up interviews were
conducted from 1982 to 1984, in 1987, and in 1992. The
1982 to 1984 interview was conducted at the subject's resi-
dence. The 1987 and 1992 interviews were conducted by
telephone.8-10
DEFINITION OF PREVALENT AND INCIDENT
DIABETES MELLITUS
At baseline, subjects who responded yes to the question "Has
a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes or sugar dia-
betes?" were categorized as having prevalent diabetes melli-
tus. Subjects who did not report diabetes mellitus but who
had evidence of glucose in their urine at baseline were also
considered to have prevalent diabetes mellitus. At each fol-
low-up survey, data were used from subjects' reports of phy-
sician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus, health care facility
records, and death certificates to identify incident cases of
diabetes mellitus (International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision [codes 250.xx]).11 The characteristics of sub-
jects with diabetes in this cohort have been described pre-
viously.12 Fasting glucose was not measured at baseline or
during follow-up, nor was an oral glucose tolerance test con-
ducted.
ASCERTAINMENT OF LEA
At each of the 3 follow-up interviews, subjects or their prox-
ies were asked whether the subject had stayed overnight
in a hospital since the previous interview. The Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure
codes corresponding to these 3 sets of hospitalization data
were used to identify subjects with nontraumatic LEAs
(codes 84.10-84.19).13
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Crude rates of amputation (per 1000 person-years) were
calculated separately for black and white subjects, and the
age-adjusted rate ratio was calculated using the age distri-
bution of the 1970 US population as the standard.14,15 Be-
cause subjects with multiple amputations contribute more
than 1 event to the numerator, rates were calculated in 2
ways (1) the total number of LEAs during follow-up and
(2) the subjects' first amputation during follow-up. The un-
paired t test and 2 statistic were used to examine differ-
ences in baseline characteristics between subjects who had
an LEA during follow-up and those who had none, and be-
tween subjects with 1 LEA and those with 2 or more. Us-
ing Cox proportional hazards regression, we modeled as-
sociations between race, diabetes mellitus, and risk of first
LEA. These analyses were controlled for potentially con-
founding factors, those variables hypothesized to be asso-
ciated with both the primary exposures of interest (race and
diabetes mellitus) and also with the outcome (LEA).16,17 The
proportional hazards regression procedure (PHREG) was
used in the SAS statistical software system (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC; release 6.11, 1996).
Since duration of diabetes mellitus increases the risk
of macrovascular complications, our models included sepa-
rate indicator variables for incident and prevalent diabe-
tes mellitus. While these variables are imperfect proxies for
diabetes mellitus duration, distinguishing between case types
in this way has been used in previous studies of diabetic
complications.18 We examined the interaction of race and
both prevalent and incident diabetes mellitus by using cross-
product terms (eg, race  prevalent diabetes) to deter-
mine if the risk of LEA associated with diabetes mellitus
duration depended on race. White subjects without dia-
betes were considered the reference group.
Age, sex, smoking history (ever vs never), baseline hy-
pertension, and BMI and subscapular and triceps skinfold
values were considered potential confounders of the asso-
ciation with LEA of either race or diabetes mellitus. Socio-
economic status (SES) was also considered a potential con-
founder. While no single variable adequately represents the
complexity of SES, previous studies of diabetes mellitus have
used education as a proxy,19-21 and it is reasonable to specu-
late that this variable is also associated with LEA. Qua-
dratic terms for continuous variables were examined to de-
termine if these measures had nonlinear associations with
LEA risk. We also tested for interaction between race and
smoking, baseline hypertension, and education.
Regression analyses were restricted to black and white
subjects 35 years or older at baseline (n = 10 778) because
there were no LEAs in the youngest age group. Disarticula-
tions of the knee and hip were not considered in multivari-
ate analyses, since they are unlikely to be associated with dia-
betesmellitus.Subjectswithmissingdatafortheindependent
variables were excluded from multivariate analyses.
We entered age, race, and prevalent and incident dia-
betes mellitus into an initial model predicting LEA risk. Po-
tential confounders were then entered to determine how
they influenced preliminary associations, and interaction
and quadratic terms were examined. The Wald 2 test was
used to test the significance of individual  coefficients, and
the likelihood ratio test was used to define the final model.
We tested the proportionality assumption in 2 ways with
a focus on race and diabetes mellitus. First, we plotted the
log(-log[survival]) function against log time separately for
strata of diabetes mellitus and race, and then we examined
interactions of log(time) with race and diabetes mellitus
status.22,23

follow-up was 2.87, and was attenuated slightly to 2.78
following adjustment for age (Table 1). The crude and
age-adjusted rate ratios for first LEAs were 2.38 and 2.14,
respectively.
Amputations of toes and amputations below and
above the knee accounted for 86.7% of LEAs; the loca-
tions of the LEAs were distributed similarly in black and
white subjects. As expected, amputations of toes were
more common in younger adults and, conversely, LEAs
below and above the knee were more frequent in older
age groups.
Although black subjects made up only 15.2% of the
NHEFS cohort, they accounted for 27.8% of subjects
with LEAs (P.002; Table 2). Lower extremity ampu-
tations occurred more frequently in individuals with
prevalent or incident diabetes mellitus than in subjects
with no diabetes (P.001 for both prevalent and inci-
dent cases). Subjects with LEAs were significantly older
at baseline than those without (age, 61.1 vs 48.8 years
[P.001]), and men underwent more amputations than
women (P = .02). Baseline BMI was higher in subjects
with LEAs than in those without (27.9 vs 25.6 kg/m2
[P.001]), as was the occurrence of baseline hyperten-
sion (60.4% vs 27.4% [P.001]). There was no differ-
ence in smoking history between the 2 groups (61.0% vs
56.9%), but subjects with LEAs were significantly more
likely than those without to have discontinued high
school before graduation (74.1% vs 44.4%; P.001).
Thirty-seven subjects (34.2% of all amputees) had
2 or more LEAs, and 10 (9.7%) had 3 or more. The most
striking differences between subjects with 1 vs those with
multiple LEAs were race and diabetes mellitus: 53% of
black subjects with LEAs had 2 or more, compared with
only 26% of their white counterparts (P = 008). Fifty-
seven percent of subjects with multiple LEAs had dia-
betes mellitus at baseline, compared with only 28% of
subjects with 1 LEA (P = .004; data not shown).
Figure 1 shows that black subjects were signifi-
cantly more likely than their white counterparts to be
included in 1 of the 2 diabetes mellitus categories
(prevalent, 10.6% vs 6.8% [P.001]; incident, 11.9% vs
7.4% [P.001]). Figure 2 shows that, in subjects with
diabetes mellitus, more LEAs occurred among black
subjects than white; the difference, however, is signifi-
cant only for incident diabetes mellitus (3.4% vs 1.4%
[P = .02]). There was no race difference in the propor-
tion of individuals without diabetes who had LEAs.
The final regression model was based on data from
101 subjects with LEAs and 9700 censored subjects, rep-
resenting 91% of all black and white subjects 35 years
or older. Results of our initial and final models of analy

sis of risk factors for first LEAs are presented in Table 3.
The initial model, which examined only the effects of age,
race, and diabetes mellitus, indicated significant asso-
ciations between these factors and the risk of first LEA.
While black subjects had nearly twice the diabetes melli-
tus­ and age-adjusted risk of LEA compared with white
subjects (relative risk [RR], 1.93 [95% confidence inter-
val (CI), 1.26-2.96]), the magnitude of risk associated
with diabetes mellitus was much larger; subjects with
prevalent and incident diabetes mellitus had RRs of 7.97
and 3.46, respectively, indicating an effect of diabetes
mellitus duration on LEA risk independent of age and
race. There were no significant interactions between race
and diabetes mellitus in this model. The final model was
parsimonious, including variables for age, race, preva-
lent and incident diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smok-
ing, and education. Relative to subjects who remained
without diabetes throughout the study, those with preva-
lent diabetes mellitus had more than 7 times the risk of
an LEA (RR, 7.19 [95% CI, 4.61-11.22]), and those with
incident diabetes mellitus had over 3 times the risk of
an LEA (RR, 3.15 [95% CI, 1.84-5.37]). The associa-
tions between diabetes mellitus and LEA were only slightly
attenuated compared with the initial model. Subjects who
ever smoked were twice as likely to have an LEA during
the study than those who never did (RR, 2.02 [95% CI,
1.34-3.05]), and those with baseline hypertension were
twice as likely to have an LEA than those without hy-
pertension (RR, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.35-3.09]). Lack of a high
school education doubled LEA risk (RR, 2.14 [95% CI,
1.32-3.49]). While race was significantly predictive of LEA
in the initial model, this association diminished below
conventional significance following adjustment for edu-
cation, hypertension, and smoking (RR, 1.49 [95% CI,
0.95-2.34]). Baseline BMI, subscapular and triceps skin-
fold values, and sex did not predict LEAs in this sample.
There were no significant interaction terms in the final
model, nor was there evidence of quadratic associations
between continuous variables and LEA.
To investigate whether SES increased the risk of LEA
independently of race, we performed supplemental analy-
ses in white subjects only, since this group is often con-
sidered at lower risk of diabetic complications than black
subjects. These analyses revealed that lack of a high school
education increased the RR of LEA among white sub-
jects by 2.5 (95% CI, 1.5-4.4), independently of age, dia-
betes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension.
COMMENT
To our knowledge, this is the longest prospective study
of the combined effects of race and diabetes mellitus on
the risk of LEA, and one of few with black and white sub-
jects and subjects with and without diabetes drawn from
the same population. Our preliminary analyses showed
that between 1971 and 1992, the age-adjusted rate of all
LEAs was 2.8 times higher in black than white subjects,
and that the age-adjusted rate of the first LEA was 2.1
times higher in black than white subjects.
The NHEFS offers a better design and population
than prior studies of LEA. Previous investigations of LEA
have been based on data from subjects with diabetes alone,
without a comparison group without diabetes.5,24 These
studies also had shorter follow-up periods,1,5,24 were not

founding variables,4,26 and/or did not include a multira-
cial reference population.1,2,24 In the NHEFS, 2 decades
of follow-up of the diverse cohort permitted calculation
of risk estimates from a representative sample of US adults
whose potentially confounding characteristics such as
smoking and hypertension were well described. Avail-
ability of data on confounding variables allowed adjust-
ments in our multivariate analysis that were not pos-
sible in previous studies that used hospital discharge data
to ascertain LEA. Thus, the RRs calculated from our re-
gression models provide an accurate description of the
associations between prevalent and incident diabetes
mellitus, race, and risk of LEA from the early 1970s to
the early 1990s.
RESULTS FROM multivariate analyses indi-
cated that race per se may play a limited
role in the cause of first LEAs when edu-
cation, smoking, and hypertension are also
considered. We showed that following ad-
justment for these factors, a significant age- and diabe-
tes mellitus­adjusted association between being black and
risk of LEA was diminished below conventional signifi-
cance. However, the relatively small number of black sub-
jects with LEA makes interpretation of this finding dif-
ficult. There may be unexplained factors that made black
subjects more susceptible to diabetic complications lead-
ing to LEA. Alternatively, better adjustment in this study
for SES or environmental factors might have dimin-
ished the LEA risk associated with race. Further studies
are needed to address these questions.
Black individuals with diabetes mellitus may have
worse glycemic control than their white counterparts, and
may therefore be at increased risk of complications lead-
ing to LEA. Recent data from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) sup-
port this hypothesis, showing that black subjects with
impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed and diag-
nosed diabetes mellitus had higher mean glycosylated he-
moglobin levels than white subjects.27 Along the same
lines, diabetes mellitus may be identified later among black
than among white subjects, thereby increasing the preva-
lence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and raising the
possibility that vascular and nerve damage and plantar
ulcers may already be present at, or develop shortly af-
ter, diabetes mellitus diagnosis in black patients. This may
reduce or eliminate the period of secondary prevention
in this group.28 Greater rates of undiagnosed diabetes
mellitus among black compared with white subjects were
demonstrated in NHANES III.
Another explanation for our findings is that care for
diabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy, and peripheral ar-
terial disease may be worse among black subjects than
white, leading to higher rates of amputation. A recent
study showed that of individuals with diabetes mellitus,
black subjects were more likely than white subjects to
smoke and have uncontrolled hypertension, and less likely
to have health insurance or a private health care pro-
vider.29 Another study showed that older black subjects
were more likely than older white subjects to have LEA,
and less likely to undergo lower extremity revascular-
ization and angioplasty, 2 limb-sparing surgical proce-
dures.30 Racial differences in glycemic control among dia-
betic subjects, duration of diabetes mellitus prior to
diagnosis, prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus,
and access to appropriate health care may all contribute
to the higher rates of LEA among black Americans. How-
ever, these factors are more strongly related to social rather
than biological phenomena. Consistent with the latter hy-
pothesis is the recent finding of an inverse association
between SES and all-cause mortality among individuals
with diabetes in the Whitehall Study and the WHO Mul-
tinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetes.31
If elevated LEA risk were related more to black race
than to social factors, one would not expect to find an
association between SES and LEA risk among white sub-
jects. However, the significant association between SES
and LEA among white subjects and the lower race-
associated risk among their black counterparts follow-
ing adjustment for education, smoking, and hyperten-
sion suggest not only that race per se may play a limited
role in the cause of LEA, but also that social factors act
to increase LEA risk regardless of race.
Our results are consistent with findings from pre-
vious studies of LEA to the extent that we found signifi-
cant associations between increased risk of LEA and dia-
betes mellitus,1,3,4,26 smoking,5 and hypertension.5,25 Our
results indicate that the risk of LEA was 7 and 3 times
higher among individuals with prevalent and incident dia-
betes mellitus, respectively, compared with those with-
out diabetes. The graded risks associated with these case
types suggest an effect of duration of diabetes mellitus
on LEA risk, and are consistent with previous findings.5
While rates of all LEAs are important from a public
health and resource use perspective, the rate of first LEA
is more related to cause. In our investigation, age-
adjusted rates of all and of first LEAs indicated that black
subjects experienced higher rates of LEA than white, a
finding that is consistent with a previous study.4 How-
ever, it should be emphasized that in this and other stud-
ies that used hospital records to ascertain LEA,4,24-26 it is
often not possible to determine if the "first" LEA ascer-
tained during the study period is actually the first LEA
for that individual.
In our study, 54 (50%) of 108 subjects with LEA
had diabetes mellitus listed as a discharge diagnosis.
This finding is consistent with results from the National
Hospital Discharge Survey, which found that 51% of all
patients with LEAs had diabetes mellitus as a discharge
diagnosis. It is consistent also with data from the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, which showed
that 45% of LEAs were performed on people with diabe-
tes mellitus listed on a medical record.4,32 However, in
the NHEFS, diabetes mellitus may have been present in
a larger proportion of LEAs than we report. Two of the
54 subjects with LEAs who did not have diabetes melli-
tus on their discharge records reported diabetes mellitus
at baseline, and 6 reported diabetes mellitus during
follow-up. Although these subjects were classified as
having diabetes mellitus in our analyses, the discrepancy
between self-reported diabetes mellitus and diabetes
mellitus listed on discharge records following LEA high-
lights underreporting of diabetes mellitus­related LEAs

on these records. Such underreporting results in an
underestimation of the contribution of diabetes mellitus
to the occurrence of LEA.
This study has several limitations, mostly related to
the data available in the NHEFS. Since fasting glucose
levels were not available, we relied on subject reports of
physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus, hospital dis-
charge records, and death certificates. It is known that self-
reporting underestimates true prevalence of diabetes melli-
tus by 30% to 50% and that hospital records underreport
diabetes mellitus by as much as 40%. Diabetes mellitus is
also underreported on death certificates.33-36 It was not pos-
sible to determine the extent of misclassification result-
ing from undiagnosed and unreported diabetes mellitus.
However, since diabetes mellitus was more frequently un-
diagnosedinblacksubjectsthaninwhitesubjects,andsince
blacks were at higher risk of LEAs, any misclassification
that occurred would likely have resulted in an under-
estimation of the association between race and LEA. Un-
derreporting and misclassification of diabetes mellitus
may help explain why the magnitude of the association
between diabetes mellitus and LEA was lower here than
in a previous study4 in which the rate ratio was reported
to be as high as 15. However, in the Most and Sinnock4
study, ascertainment of diabetes mellitus was limited to
information gathered from the same hospital discharge
records from which the LEA data were obtained. In our
study, diabetes mellitus diagnoses from hospital dis-
charge records were supplemented by a urine glucose
test at baseline and by subject reports throughout the
follow-up period. More extensive diabetes mellitus as-
certainment and diabetes mellitus ascertainment in-
dependent of the hospital visit during which the LEA oc-
curred may also help explain the difference in rates
between studies.
In summary, this study showed that during 20 years
of follow-up, the age-adjusted rate of LEA among black
Americans was 2.8 times that of their white counterparts,
and that diabetes mellitus and its duration were strong pre-
dictors of LEA risk. Hypertension, smoking, and low edu-
cationallevelwerealsostronglypredictiveofLEArisk.These
factors appear to diminish the biological link between race
and LEA. Decreasing the occurrence of diabetes mellitus
by addressing risk factors such as obesity as well as reduc-
tions in hypertension and smoking are strategies that
may have a substantial impact on the future occurrence
of LEA among both black and white adults.
