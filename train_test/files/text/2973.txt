tim te ge-specific rates of infectious syphilis, gonorrhea, and	 	 pelvic mflammatory disease requiring hospitalization among
sexually experienced  adolescent and young adult women in 1971

and 1976. Rates of all three diseases were highest in adolescents and declined exponentially with increasing age. Age-related re­ porting biases are unlikely to account for these findings. Aspects of adolescent sexual behavior and reproductive physiology are among plausible explanations. With the decline in age at first coitus in recent years, sexually transmitted diseases have become increasingly important factors in the health care of adolescents.

ADOLESCENTS are of special interest in prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The age at which women in the United States began coitus declined through the 1970s,1 while the rates of gonorrhea and syphilis were increasing, especially in adolescents.2 3 The consequences of STDs are especially unfortunate for young nulliparous women when they are rendered infertile by salpingitis or ectopic pregnancy.
  Westrom and Mardh defined age-specific rates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in Lund, Sweden, and en­ virons by calculating disease rates during the early 1970s for the population at risk of developing PID, i.e., women who are sexually experienced. They  found that the risk of PID declined with age and that the risk of PID in sexually active 15-year-olds was ten times that in sexually active 25-year-olds.4 Surveys of the sexual activity of ad­ olescent females in the United States in 1971 and 1976, 5 together with data concerning the incidences of certain STDs, permit similar estimates for the United States.

Methods
  Age-specific rates of reported gonorrhea and syphilis in females were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA (courtesy of Robert E. Johnson and Joseph H. Blount). Gonorrhea has been reported by five­ year age groups since 1971. Infectious (primary, second­ ary, and early latent) syphilis has been reported by year of age since 1970. Cases of pelvic inflammatory disease identified in the National Hospital Discharge Survey since 1970 were reported by year of age for the relevant cat­ egories from the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision,6 as previously described7 ( courtesy of Robert E. Johnson). A case was identified as PID if PID was listed as the first, second, third, or fourth diagnosis. The sizes of the U. S. female population by year of age for 1971 and 1976 were derived from U. S. Census

  For syphilis and PID, the average numbers of cases per year for 1970-1972 were used to approximate the incidence i.n 1971, and the 1975-1977 averages were used for 1976. Since age-specific rates for gonorrhea were grouped together for ages 30-39 prior to 1971, only 1971 and 1976 data concerning age-specific incidence of gon­ orrhea were used.
  The estimated proportion of female teenagers in the United States who were sexually experienced in 1971 and 1976 was reported by Zelnik et al.5 by year of exact age from 12 to 19 years. The proportion experienced at age x was taken as the average of the proportion experienced
at exact ages x and x + l. No direct estimate for the age­
specific prevalence of sexual experience of adult women over 19 years of age in 1971 and 1976 is available. We estimated this by linear extrapolation from the data of Zelnik et al.5 concerning exact ages 16- 19,5 the ages for

which the increase in sexual experience with age was most linear. Age-specific rates of reported syphilis, gonorrhea, and hospitalized cases of PID divided by the fraction of women with prior coital experience in 1971 and 1976 yielded age-specific rates for sexually experienced women. The estimates of the age-specific prevalence of sexual experience obtained by this method of extrapolation were compared with an estimate derived from separate data. Hunt reported the prevalence of sexual experience for unmarried 18-24-year-old white women in 1972 to be

70%.10 The 1970 U. S. Census reported marital status by race and age.11 Assuming that all ever-married women are sexually experienced, the estimated number of sexually experienced 18-24-year-old white women in 1971 was the sum of the number ever-married (from U.S. Census data11) plus 70% of those never-married.

Results
  The proportions of women of each age estimated to  be sexually experienced in 1971 and 1976 are listed in table 1. All women were estimated to be sexually expe­ rienced at age 22.2 years in 1971 and at 21.6 years in 1976. Extrapolation from the data of Zelnik et al.5 gives an estimate of 87% of 18-24-year-old white women having been sexually experienced in 1971. Extrapolation from the data of Hunt 10 gives an estimate of 86% of 18-24- year-old white women having been sexually experienced in 1972.
  Age-specific, experience-adjusted rates of reported fe­ male cases of infectious syphilis, gonorrhea, and hospi­ talized PID in 1971 and 1976 are shown in figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Power curves fitted to the data points are shown for syphilis and hospitalized cases of PID, and the data for calculating these curves and those for reported gonorrhea are shown in table 2. The adjusted rates of all three conditions declined exponentially with age. The

rate of reported infectious syphilis in sexually experienced 15-year-old women in 1971 was ~ 185 per 100,000 and was ~45 per 100,000 for 25-year-olds. Similarly in 1976, the rate of infectious syphilis was -90 per 100,000 for sexually experienced 15-year-olds and ~ 35 per 100,000 for 25-year-olds. In 1971, the rates of hospitalized PID for sexually experienced 15-year-old and 25-year-old women were ~ 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively. In 1976, rates were ~ 1.3% and ~0.6% for 15- and 25-year-olds, respectively. In  1971, the  rate of reported gonorrhea for
sexually experienced ten to 14-year-olds was ~3.0%, and

~3.5% and ,_,1.7% for ten to 14-year-olds and 20-24- year-olds, respectively. If averaged over three years as for the data on syphilis and hospitalized PID, the 1971 and the 1976 estimates for rates of reported gonorrhea for sexually experienced ten to 14-year-olds were also higher than those for 15-19-year-olds (3028 and 2426 cases per 100,000, respectively for 1971, and, for 1976, 3522 and
3453 cases per 100,000, respectively). In 1971, adjusted rates for infectious syphilis were higher and adjusted rates
