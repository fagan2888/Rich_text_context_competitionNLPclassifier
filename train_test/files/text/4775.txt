Introduction
Effective child care policy is integral to overcoming gender
segregation in the labor market and is an internationally held
policy goal in governments' pursuit of economic growth (cf.
Picchio, 1992; Seguino, 2000; Tzannatos, 1999). It can be
defined as "a care service for children 0­5 years to cover
working hours, provided by nursery nurses or unqualified
care staff in a variety of settings including domestic settings"
(Penn, 2000, p. 37). As a policy issue, it spans a number of
key issues and debates including gender equality, the domes-
tic division of labor, appropriate development and support
for children, the contemporary role of the welfare state, the
form and functioning of the labor market, and the wider
health of the economy (cf. Saraceno, 2011). Although lead-
ing studies have charted the changing political context shap-
ing child care policy development in the United Kingdom
over recent years (Harker, 2006), the present study makes an
original contribution by analyzing electoral discourse and
the level of attention ("issue salience") and use of language
("policy framing") in relation to child care in party manifes-
tos for Westminster and "regional" elections.1
It is a transferable method suited to future comparative
study of social policy developments in (quasi-)federal welfare
regimes. Accordingly, the discourse-based process of mandate
seeking in election programs matters to the development of
child care, because it constitutes the link between the repre-
sentative process and policy development in liberal democ-
racies. In this, manifestos serve multitude of functions: (a)
They provide substantive details of future government (and
opposition) parties' policies, (b) they show how parties com-
pare in the priority they attach to child care, (c) electoral dis-
course reveals areas of inter-party conflict and consensus,
and (d) such a focus provides insights into how policy is
shaped by party ideology and contingent on local socio-
economic and political factors. In this regard, it reveals the
political use of language and discourse-based processes that
underpin the development of public policy on child care,
thereby providing a "discursive benchmark" to complement
ex post analyses of policy delivery (Baslé, 2006; Meyers,
Glaser, & Donald, 1998). In short, it is a focus that engages
with Sumsion and Press's (2007) prescient call
to open up to analysis and debate the role of politics and policy
in framing community perceptions of childcare . . . [and explore]

"Post-Feminist" Era of Social Investment
and Territorial Welfare? Exploring the
Issue Salience and Policy Framing of Child
Care in U.K. Elections 1983-2011
Paul Chaney1
Abstract
Earlier work has tended to overlook the formative origins of child care policy in liberal democracies. Accordingly, this
study examines mandate-seeking and parties' envisioning of child care with reference to issue salience and policy framing in
party manifestos in U.K. Westminster and regional elections. It reveals a significant increase in issue salience following its
emergence as a manifesto issue in the 1980s, thereby confirming it as part of the wider rise of "valence politics." The framing
data reveal that a "post-feminist" discourse of "social investment" has generally displaced the political framing of child care as
a gender equality issue. It is argued that this is inherently problematic and reflects parties' failure to address ongoing gender
inequality in the labor market. Notably, the data also illustrate the way devolution is leading to the territorialization of child
care in the United Kingdom--no longer solely mandated in Westminster elections, policy is now contingent on the discursive
practices of regional party politics and shaped by local socio-economic factors.

What there is to be learned from critical analyses of policy
trends . . . and how we both deconstruct and reconstruct the
policy landscape. (p. 96)
The current focus acknowledges the role of electoral dis-
course as an important indicator of political agenda setting
(Cobb & Ross, 1997). Moreover, as Rigby, Tarrant, and
Neuman (2007) cogently observe, attention to discourse and
policy design recognizes the way that both "institutionalize
and legitimize particular forms of governmental involvement
in children's lives--as well as give power and voice to some
interests over others--resulting in a new political context for
future policy debates" (p. 98). Such an approach also pro-
vides insights into parties' attempts to appeal to particular
audiences at the time of elections. In turn, this shapes wider
voting patterns and determines which policies are endorsed
by the electorate.
The latter is explained by mandate and accountability
theory (Budge & Hofferbert, 1990; Fearon, 2003; Royed,
1996). The former asserts that when in government, parties
should implement the policies that they pledged when run-
ning for office. In contrast, accountability theory asserts that
elections are effectively "opinion polls" on the performance
of the party (or parties) forming the previous administra-
tion--and whether they delivered their manifesto policy pro-
gram (Przeworski, Stokes, & Manin, 1999).
Two non-discrete contemporary factors underline the
importance of the foregoing theoretical underpinnings: devo-
lution and the rise of coalition government. In the former
case, study of child care politics needs to be cognizant of the
discursive underpinnings of distinctive territorial approaches.
This links to earlier pioneering study (Randall, 2000) that
underlined the limits for child care policy convergence
between (welfare) states in multi-level systems--as well as
scholarship on how (quasi-)federal state architecture affects
the design of welfare (Mahon & Brennan, 2013). Here, we
complement this work by examining the impact of the plural-
izing of electoral systems that accompanies state decentral-
ization--such that single statewide ballots are supplemented
by regional elections. With regard to the second factor,
whereas the current Westminster coalition government is
something of a rarity at a U.K. level, multi-party executives
have become a routine aspect of devolved government in the
United Kingdom. Electoral discourse thus plays a key role in
constructing coalition agendas for government as the respec-
tive partners seek to integrate party-specific election pledges
on child care into a single executive policy program (cf.
Leitner, 2010).
In summary, the following discussion explores the con-
temporary development of child care policy by (a) exploring
changes in the issue salience of child care since its emer-
gence in the 1980s, (b) examining policy framing in mani-
festo discourse, and (c) analyzing the impact of state
decentralization. Accordingly, the remainder of the article is
structured thus: A discussion of the literature on the child
care policy and electoral competition is followed by an out-
line of the research context and methodology. The findings in
relation to the study aims are then presented in two principal
sections: statewide and regional elections. In the latter case,
the discussion is sub-divided, the first section of which deals
with inter-polity contrasts in issue salience and framing, and
the second with inter-party contrasts in issue salience and
framing. The main findings and their implications are dis-
cussed in the conclusion.
Electoral Politics and the Formative
Phase of Child Care Policy Making
Over several decades, child care provision, including paid
parental leave, has been an increasingly common feature of
social policy in many European countries and beyond
(Melhuish & Petrogiannis, 2006). In contrast, in the United
Kingdom, child care policies have only developed since the
late 1990s. Hitherto, provision was left to voluntary groups
or the market; statutory maternity leave was limited and state
involvement centered on vulnerable children and those in
residential care. However, structural pressure on the "male
breadwinner model" on which the welfare state was pre-
mised--not least by the increasing prevalence of dual-earner
households--has, albeit belatedly, prompted government
intervention (Land, 1999). This has also been driven by EU
policy, notably the goal that by 2010, women's participation
in the labor market should have reached 60%, and that child
care services should be available to at least a third of children
below 3 years of age and 90% of children aged between 3
and school-entry age (cf. Plantenga, Remmery, Seigel, &
Sementini, 2008). Although existing accounts chart recent
developments in government policy on child care (cf. Rahilly
& Johnston, 2002; Scheiwe & Willekens, 2009; Smith,
2007), limited attention has been given to the formative
phase of policy making and its electoral underpinnings.
When attention has focused on child care policy it has
largely examined party divisions on child care (Leitner,
2010), internal party debates on the funding of child care
programmes (Brennan, 1998), addressing opposition to par-
ties' child care policy (Eisenstein, 1981), the interplay
between structural and ideational factors in establishing
party platforms (Sorensen, 2011), and sex discrimination and
setting party election programmes (Howell, 2006). Little
attention has been given to the longitudinal study of electoral
discourse and the prioritization and framing of policy pro-
posals on child care.
Accordingly, to address this lacuna, the following draws
on the electoral theory of "issue salience" (RePass, 1971;
Robertson, 1976). This is a conceptualization whereby piv-
otal importance lies not on party issue positions but on the
prominence and attention afforded to different issues in their
campaigns; ergo the more an issue is emphasized by a party
(making it "salient"), the greater the likelihood it will attract
Chaney 3
voters who share similar concerns. Traditionally, quantitative
analysis has been used to explore this (Libbrecht, Maddens,
Swenden, & Fabre, 2009; Volkens, 2001). The present exam-
ination takes a more holistic approach by combining this
with an exploration of policy framing. Frames here are "a
necessary property of a text--where text is broadly con-
ceived to include discourses, patterned behaviour, and sys-
tems of meaning, policy logics, constitutional principles, and
deep cultural narratives" (Creed, Langstraat, & Scully, 2002,
p. 37).
In electoral theory, child care is a valence issue (Stokes,
1992). In other words, it is a topic that generally unites voters
(given its wider social benefits, few would argue against the
regulated provision of child care). However, it is also a "posi-
tion issue," meaning that parties differ in their views on what
public policy should--and should not--aim to achieve, not
least in relation to the amount of resources and support
extended by government. Inter alia, parties'contrasting issue
positions reflect their ideological standpoint on the appropri-
ate balance between the market and state (Barnett & Barnett,
1997). Traditionally, those on the Right have embraced neo-
liberal, market-based solutions and eschewed state interven-
tion; whereas those of the Left have advocated the harnessing
of state power to promote social welfare (Navarro, 1998). In
reality, party positions are rarely as polarized as this sug-
gests, as evidenced by the literature on welfare pluralism
(Beresford & Croft, 1983). Underlining the latter point, over
the past two decades, U.K. politics has been marked by the
rise of valence politics, as the main parties have converged
toward the political center ground (Bara & Budge, 2001;
Bromley & Curtice, 2002). The present findings showing the
steep rise in issue salience over the past three-and-a-half
decades are significant because they confirm child care's role
in the rise of valence politics.
In turn, this increase in salience is a function of the
increasing party politicization of child care. This refers to
how issues rise and fall on the political agenda, as parties
compete for votes on a given issue (Carter, 2006). It is allied
to the concept of "issue ownership" (Petrocik, 1996)--
whereby parties prioritize certain policy issues, emphasize
earlier policy successes, and attempt to highlight party com-
petence on a given topic while dismissing rivals' records.
The underlying motive is to be seen as the "owners" of an
issue--thereby securing electoral and reputational
advantage.
By focusing on statewide and regional elections,2 this
study provides a transferable methodology that gives further
insights into the impact of multi-level governance on child
care policy making. This approach is appropriate, because
"devolution"--or move to quasi-federalism in the United
Kingdom (Gamble, 2006)--is part of the wider international
trend of state restructuring (Doornbos, 2006). Under the
revised governance structures, the Scottish, Welsh, and
Northern Irish governments have responsibility for many
aspects of state child care policy in their territories3 (for a
discussion of the policy responsibilities of the devolved leg-
islatures and governments, see, for example, Birrell, 2008).
Method
By applying mixed research methods, the current study
responds to earlier calls for policy work to combine content
and critical discourse analysis (Baker et al., 2008).
Accordingly, issue salience is determined by content analysis
of manifestos. This is applied by recording the number of
incidences of key words, ideas, or meanings in party pro-
grams (Krippendorff & Bock, 2008) and is complemented by
frame analysis (Schön & Rein, 1994). The latter is concerned
with how, as key political texts, manifestos enable parties to
construct (or "frame") policy proposals on child care and
other matters. In electoral terms, as Nelson and Oxleya
(1997) observe, "frames influence opinions by stressing spe-
cific values, facts and other considerations, endowing them
with greater apparent relevance to the issue than they might
appear to have under an alternative frame" (p. 75). In this
way, framing leads to political agenda setting (Cobb & Ross,
1997; Cohen, 1963) and, ultimately, the substantive policies
that are mandated.
Comparative analysis of framing practices in different
polities and tiers of government is a long-established meth-
odological practice (De Vreese, Peter, & Semetko, 2001;
Papacharissi, 2008).4 However, it is acknowledged that man-
ifestos have limitations as a data source, not least because
party policy proposals are also set out in debates, speeches,
and other documents; yet, they constitute the principal politi-
cal texts that reflect a party's priorities and issue positions,
thereby allowing systematic analysis over time. Accordingly,
as noted, electronic versions of the manifestos of the leading5
parties in U.K. general elections 1983-2010 and regional
elections 1998-2011 were analyzed using appropriate
software.6
Thus, in the preliminary stage of the research, the mani-
festo texts were divided into "quasi-sentences" (or "an argu-
ment which is the verbal expression of one political idea or
issue," Volkens, 2001, p. 96).7 Dividing in this manner con-
trolled for long sentences that contain several policy propos-
als. Individual quasi-sentences were subsequently coded
using a deductive coding frame (Joffe & Yardley, 2003)
based on key topics and themes derived from the academic
literature on the child care policy (see Figure 4). Thus, this
schema incorporates a range of frames including mixed
economy provision, work/life balance, encouraging work-
place provision, regulation/child care staff training, and gen-
der equality. Divergent views on the coding emerged in less
than 2% of quasi-sentences (N = 7388; resolved by discus-
sion between coders). Issue salience was then determined by
logging the frequency of quasi-sentences in a database of
party manifestos.

Figure 1. The issue salience of child care policy in the three main parties' general election manifestos 1983-2010: All-party absolute
totals of quasi-sentences in each election (N = 210).
As existing electoral studies reveal, over recent years,
party programs have tended to become more detailed and
have a greater word length. This has potential methodologi-
cal implications for any claims of shifting salience over
time, not least because any change might be regarded as a
possible function of increased manifesto length rather than
greater attention to child care policy by the respective par-
ties. To control for this, the present analysis uses both "abso-
lute" and "relative totals" methodologies. The former details
the total number of quasi-sentences on child care; whereas
the latter re-calculates them as a percentage of all quasi-
sentences in each manifesto9 (i.e., quasi-sentences on all
topics and issues; see Figure 2 below). Because the impact
of increased manifesto word length on saliency is complex
and variable,10 both approaches have advantages and short-
comings. Moreover, notwithstanding the overall trend
toward greater manifesto length, there are major fluctua-
tions in both manifesto word totals and the number of quasi-
sentences (for example, in two of the seven election cycles
studied here, the total number of quasi-sentences in the
manifestos studies actually decreased compared with the
preceding ballot). Nevertheless, to control for any discrep-
ancies between the two methods, as noted, both were used in
the following analysis. This dual approach affirmed that the
"absolute totals" method (i.e., exploring the changing totals
of child care quasi-sentences) produced findings consistent
with those derived from the "relative proportion" method
(thus, for example, they both reveal a significant increase in
the issue salience of child care over time, see Figures 1
and 2).
Child Care Policy and Westminster
Elections 1983-2010
A survey of the election manifestos in the first decades after
the Second World War provides a clear indication of the main
political parties' role in reproducing a gender-unequal soci-
ety. It also partly explains the United Kingdom's failure to
put in place effective state child care provision seen else-
where in Europe prior to the 1990s. Thus, the present mani-
festo analysis adds further empirical basis to Lewis's (2013)
conclusion that civil servants and ministers "were deter-
mined to defend the status quo in the context of weak politi-
cal will" (p. 256). Against this backdrop, the history of child
care during the immediate post-war decades was under-
pinned by a British welfare model oriented around the male
breadwinner and largely concerned with poverty reduction
(Crompton, 1999). This is evident in the manifesto discourse
of the political Right; for example, during maternity,
All proper arrangements, both voluntary and state-aided, must
be made for the care of other young children in the family, in
order that the energies of the male breadwinner or the kindness
of neighbours and relations, which nevertheless must be the
mainspring, should not be unduly burdened. (Conservative
Party, 1945, p. 8)
It is also apparent on the Left. For example, "Liberals oppose
the bringing into industry of married women with young
children, but would not discourage schemes of industrial out-
work, to help the family budget by work done at home"
(Liberal Party, 1950, p. 14).

Child care finally emerges as a manifesto policy issue in
Westminster elections in 1983. Notably, it is articulated as a
gender equality initiative. The left-of-center Labour Party
(1983) promises, "[We will] introduce positive action pro-
grammes to promote women's rights and opportunities, and
appoint a cabinet minister to promote equality between the
sexes. [Furthermore] We will: Improve child care and other
social services" (p. 17).11 Yet, it continues to attract limited
attention in party programs until the 1992 election (just 3.3%
of all references were recorded before 1992). Subsequently,
there is a significant increase in salience; 12.7% of all refer-
ences were made in the 1992 election. There are a number of
explanations for this step change. One is the growing domes-
tic and international political attention to gender equality
(Mancini & O'Leary, 1999; Randall, 1996). In turn, this was
driven by the earlier round of activism associated with "sec-
ond-wave" feminism, a process that highlighted the domestic
division of labor as an enduring source of inequality between
the sexes (cf. Keetley & Pettegrew, 2005). Further impetus
was derived from legislative developments (including the
U.K.'s ratification, inApril 1986, of the United Nations [UN]
Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against
Women [CEDAW]). This obliged government "to encourage
the provision of the necessary supporting social services to
enable parents to combine family obligations with work
responsibilities and participation in public life, in particular
through promoting the establishment and development of a
network of child-care facilities" (UN, 1979, Article 11, 2c).
On the back of these developments, the data reveal how
child care becomes an increasingly important policy issue in
U.K. electoral politics from 1992 onward. Thus, there is a
threefold increase in the number of references to child care
when the 1992 and 2010 elections are compared. It is a polit-
ical (re-)prioritization confirmed by the contrasting method-
ological techniques used here. Specifically, it is revealed
when absolute totals of child care quasi-sentences are exam-
ined (Figure 1)--and, it is also apparent when all parties'
child care references are plotted as a percentage of total
quasi-sentences (i.e., on all topics and issues) in each elec-
tion (Figure 2). Thus, 3.3% of references were made in the
1980s, 19.4% in the 1990s, 36.2% in 2000s, and 41.2% in
2010.
The data also reveal the party dynamics behind the overall
increase in issue salience. In this regard, there are statisti-
cally significant differences between parties (p  .001).12
Over the post-1983 period, Labour can be seen as "issue
owners" of child care; the party accounts for more than two
thirds (68%) of manifesto references (this compares with
23.3% for the Conservatives and just 8.6% for the Liberal
Democrats). It is only belatedly that the Conservative Party
has begun to challenge Labour's position. For almost two
thirds (61.3%) of the party's references to child care were
made in the 2005-2010 election cycle. This finding supports
earlier analysis highlighting how the party has attempted to
(re-)position itself as being more socially progressive than in
the past (cf. Kerr, Byrne, & Foster, 2011). Examples of the
associated politicking in the manifesto discourse include the
following: "the current government has shown itself wholly
insensitive to the need to help develop family-friendly work-
ing practices" (Labour Party, 1997, p. 38), and "under Labour,

Britain has the most expensive child care in Europe, and
many working families receive no help" (Conservative Party,
2005, p. 29).
Analysis of the manifesto data also reveals statistically
significant differences in way that the three major parties
frame policy proposals on child care (p  .05).13 Reflecting
recent emphasis on multi-agency and cross-sector working
(Anning, 2005), the lead frame overall is "mixed economy of
provision." The Labour Party accounts for just more than a
half (52.6%) of such references, followed by the
Conservatives (31.6%) and Liberal Democrats (15.8%).
The discourse under this frame is typified by statements
such as "we will support the commitment of community and
voluntary groups to build up a diverse range of child care--
from Early Excellence Centres to neighbourhood nurseries
and informal care" (Labour Party, 2001, p. 34). In this way,
the discourse underpins the development of the "Sure Start"
program of children's centers to provide child care, early
education, health, and family support introduced by the party
in government in 1998 (cf. Melhuish & Hall, 2007). It is a
stark reminder of Labour's shift away from its earlier empha-
sis on statist solutions to welfare issues (Pugh, 2011). It is
also reflective of the wider rise of welfare pluralism, whereby
voluntary and private-sector organizations complement state
welfare delivery (Beresford & Croft, 1983; Fyfe, Timbrell, &
Smith, 2006; Kendall, 2000).
While noting Campbell-Barr's (2009) cogent observation
that "it is neither so simple or accurate as to suggest that the
private sector is more likely to focus on the business side of
things and the voluntary sector on the care side" (p. 85), there
is a statistically significant difference in the parties' use of
the frame (p .05).14 For the Conservatives make the major-
ity (71%) of explicit references to private-sector/for-profit
child care as part of a mixed economy of provision, whereas
Labour and the Liberal Democrats predominate in advocat-
ing third-sector partnership with public-sector providers
(68%). For example, Labour (2010) asserted, "We want to
strengthen parental engagement with Sure Start Children's
Centres. Some voluntary and third-sector organisations
already run networks of Centres, and we will now pioneer
mutual federations running groups of local Children's
Centres in the community interest" (p. 57), whereas the
Conservative Party (2010) discourse is typified by the
following:
We support the provision of free nursery care for pre-school
children and we want that support to be provided by a diverse
range of providers--including the many child-minders and
private . . . and independent nurseries which are currently being
squeezed out of the system. (p. 48)
Notwithstanding the foregoing contrasts, there is evi-
dence of Right­Left convergence in the second frame, "tax
allowance/social security payments." This reflects the wider
adoption of "social investment" approaches to welfare by
parties across the political spectrum in Europe and elsewhere
(cf. Vandenbroucke, 2011). It is a policy approach that aims
to secure future societal well-being through investing in chil-
dren and is predicated on breaking the inter-generational
transmission of inequality and disadvantage. Labour accounts
for 42.1% of "tax allowance/social security payments" quasi-
sentences, the Conservatives 36.8%, and Liberal Democrats
21%. Examples include,
We will extend the exemption from tax which applies to
workplace nurseries to all forms of employer assistance with
childcare. (Labour Party, 1992, p. 29)
During the next Parliament, we will ensure that all working
families who qualify for the working tax credit will receive up to
£50 a week for each child under the age of five, irrespective of the
type of childcare they choose. (Conservative Party, 2005, p. 38)
As Thorpe, Millear, and Petriwskyj (2012) observe,
Concern to ensure that all children have access to high-quality
educational experiences in the early years of life has instigated
policies to increase the qualifications of staff in the childcare
workforce, and in particular, to increase the number of degree
qualified teachers. (p. 317)
Thus, both main parties place emphasis on framing child
care in the context of "vocational training/return to work
support." In this, Labour accounts for 57.1% of references,
with the remainder by the Conservatives. Earlier examples
exhibit gendered language use that is less evident over later
election cycles. For example,
Expanded childcare will help women return to work and
undertake training. A critical task is to upgrade the skills of
people in work. Training and Enterprise Councils will be
retained, reformed and made more broadly representative of
their local communities and given stable budgets. (Labour Party,
1992, p. 31)
Parents who have taken time out from their careers to care for
their children will be able to apply for a scholarship to help them
undertake vocational or professional training. (Conservative
Party, 2001, p. 39)
A striking aspect of the discourse is the limited number of
quasi-sentences framed in the context of gender equality (1.3%).
The majority of examples are from the three election cycles fol-
lowing the emergence of child care as a manifesto issue in 1983.
This is significant. It suggests a "post-feminist" shift in framing
whereby gender equality is displaced in the electoral discourse
by a series of frames that emphasize child care as a mode of
"social investment" (Hübenthal & Ifland, 2011, p. 114)--or
policy intervention that "will produce pay-offs for the society's
economy,aswellasfortheindividualchild"(pp.114-115).Inthis,
the state's role is defined more in terms of strategic coordination
around wealth creation and child-safety regulation than the nor-
mative goal of gender equality and ending sex discrimination.

Examples of the earlier gender equality discourse include the
following: we will "strengthen the rights of women. We will
require public authorities and private contractors holding pub-
lic contracts to be equal-opportunity employers and improve
child-care support and facilities" (Conservative Party, 1997,
p. 18), and "women and opportunity--we believe mothers
should be treated equally by government, whether they work
outside the home or not . . . we will act where a push by govern-
ment is needed to stimulate the provision of childcare"
(Conservative Party, 1992, p. 29).
Child Care Policy in Regional Elections
1998-2011
Following devolution in the United Kingdom, child care
policy has been subject to a sharp increase in issue salience.
There has been a fivefold increase when the number of quasi-
sentences in the 1998/1999 elections is compared with that
of 2011. A further indication that meso-elections have pre-
sented significant opportunities for child care policy devel-
opment is the fact that in little more than a decade, almost
twice as many references were made in the regional ballots
(1998-2011) than in all 18 post-war statewide elections (N =
528 compared with N = 210).
Territorialization: Inter-Polity Contrasts in Issue
Salience and Framing
In the wake of the United Kingdom's move to (quasi-)feder-
alism, the territorialization of policy is shaped by statistically
significant differences in issue salience as measured by the
total number of child care quasi-sentences in the post-
1998/1999 electoral discourse in each regional polity (p 
.001).15 Most references to child care were made in Wales
(37.5%), followed by Scotland (35.8%) and Northern Ireland
(7.2%; Figure 3).
Territorialization is also apparent in statistically signifi-
cant inter-polity contrasts in policy framing (p .05).16 In
turn, this reflects ideational divergence at the regional level
in parties' thinking about what future policy should achieve
and the means by which it should be pursued. Figure 4 repre-
sents these differences graphically in the form of "framing
profiles." For each of the three regional polities, a histogram
displays the percentage of the manifesto discourse on child
care falling under each frame. In turn, the contrasting shape,
or "profile," of each underlines the differing ways in which
policy is framed, or envisioned, in each territory. Key territo-
rial differences revealed by this technique include the dispro-
portionately strong emphasis placed on mixed economy
approaches in Scotland, greater attention to tackling poverty
and regulation of child care/staff training in Wales, and the
relative emphasis on gender equality and workplace provi-
sion in Northern Ireland.
Overall, across polities, the lead frame is "mixed economy
of provision" (24.3% of child care quasi-sentences).
Manifestos in Scotland account for most references (46.6%),
followed by Wales (40.5%) and Northern Ireland (13%;
p .001).17 Of particular significance here is the contrast with
policy framing in statewide Westminster elections. Notably,
significantly less attention is placed on the private sector's
contribution to mixed economy provision at the regional level
(just 28% of references were made in regional manifestos).

This underlines the contingent nature of the formative phase of
child care policy making and the way it is now directly driven
by regional party politics in which the principal proponent of
private "for-profit" provision, the Right-of-center Conservative
Party, has significantly less electoral support. Thus, the histori-
cal basis for this contrast is Left-party strength in both Wales
and Scotland where, in the post-war period, Labour and
Nationalist Parties have tended to dominate. In these polities,
there is correspondingly greater emphasis on third-sector pro-
vision. For example, "all pre-school, nursery and childcare pro-
vision will be offered under one roof. In a true public/private
voluntary partnership councils will be encouraged to site cen-
tres in schools in rural areas or peripheral urban estates"
(Scottish National Party [SNP], 1999, p. 14), and "through a
National Early Years Strategy, local authorities will be encour-
aged to develop further partnerships, particularly with volun-
tary groups" (Plaid Cymru, 1999, p. 18).
"Economic arguments/tackling poverty" is the second-
ranked frame (19.4% of all quasi-sentences). Compared with
statewide elections (where it was the ninth-ranked frame,
accounting for just 4.3% of all quasi-sentences), the greater
propensity of parties to frame child care in this way reflects
marked differences in regional economic performance and
childpovertyacrosstheUnitedKingdom(Birch,MacKinnon,
& Cumbers, 2010; Brewer, Browne, Joyce, & Payne, 2011).
In part, its prominence in the regional discourse can be seen
as a function of the fragility and comparative weakness of
the economies of Wales and Northern Ireland, the greater
contribution of the public sector to the regional economies
(cf. Benneworth & Roberts, 2002; Dorsett, 2013), and the
devolved administrations'prioritization of anti-poverty mea-
sures (Birrell & Heenan, 2010; Morelli & Seaman, 2009;
Pedace, 2009). The territorialization of policy making is
again evident, for there are statistically significant contrasts
in the frame's use across polities (p .05).18 Manifestos in
Northern Ireland account for most references (41%), fol-
lowed by Wales (36.2%) and Scotland (22.9%). Examples of
the discourse include, "the SDLP views employment as a key
route out of poverty which is why we must develop afford-
able and sustainable childcare policies that will allow many
economically inactive people to return to the workplace"
(SDLP, 2007, p. 33), and we will "build effective opportuni-
ties for individual and community wealth creation to reduce
poverty and enhance personal fulfilment, including the
expansion of childcare facilities, aiming to develop flexible
childcare provision accessible to all" (Scottish Liberal
Democrats, 2003, p. 17).
The regional manifesto pledges also neatly illustrate the
wider issue of distributive or territorial justice in child care in
the wake of devolution. This is a concept founded on two
tenets: "who gets what where" (Smith, 1977) and "each
according to the needs of the population of that area" (Davies,
1968, p. 16). As Kay (2005) explains,
Territorial justice as conceived in the standard version refers to
the principle that . . . the UK is a unitary state; it does not have
sub-divisions of its territory that are subject to a different set of
social rights. (pp. 545-546)
However, the discourse on child care shows how spatial
variation in child care policy is driven not only by "devolved"
policies but also by the regional administrations' adaptation
of Westminster policies with extra resourcing and/or revised
eligibility criteria. For example,
. . . programmes such as the New Deal . . . We will support these
UK programmes with additional resources [emphasis added] to
provide childcare support in areas of high unemployment in
order to help those in work, training or education make the most
of the opportunities Labour has created. (Scottish Labour Party,
2003, p. 27)

"Regulation/training of childcare staff" was the fourth-
ranked frame (10.7% of references overall). Most references
were made in Wales (63.8% of the regional total), followed
by Scotland (25.9%) and Northern Ireland (10.3%; p
.001).19 The geographical contrasts in the use of this frame
again highlight the historically contingent way policy devel-
ops in the wake of the move to regional elections. The Welsh
emphasis on regulation and training can be seen as the prod-
uct of earlier official inquiries into failings in children's resi-
dential care, which has prompted a wider series of legislative
and policy reforms encompassing child care (such as the cre-
ation of a children's commissioner's office, and Welsh
Government adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of
the Child; cf. Pithouse, 2011). Examples of this discourse
include, "an Early Years Taskforce will be established to
develop . . . a national training framework for those working
with young children, together with a simplified qualifica-
tions system" (Plaid Cymru, 1999, p. 14), and we will "rec-
ognise the need to develop the childcare workforce, provide
more opportunities for training and update the information
available on the sector" (Welsh Liberal Democrats, 2007, p.
29). Notwithstanding the territorialization of policy, the lim-
ited propensity of parties to frame proposals in terms of gen-
der equality spanned in both tiers of governance; just 5.4% of
all child care quasi-sentences came under this frame at the
regional level.
Party Politicization: Inter-Party Contrasts in Issue
Salience and Framing
In each polity, the data reveal inter-party contrasts in issue
salience and the framing of child care policy. This matters
because policy is now set by contrasting arrays of parties in
each regional polity, each of which not only has its own
vision of contemporary child care policy but also has held
government office since 1998. Notably, the issue-salience
data show that, across meso-polities, nationalist parties pay
greatest attention to child care. Thus, in Scotland, the SNP
accounted for most references to child care (38.6%), followed
by Scottish Liberal Democrats, Scottish Labour, and Scottish
Conservatives (21.2%, 20.6%, and 19.6%, respectively;
p .05).20 For the SNP and Scottish Liberal Democrats, the
lead frame is "mixed economy provision" (35.9% and 30% of
each party's child care references, respectively; for example,
"the piloting of Children's Centres across Scotland . . . in a true
public/private voluntary partnership councils will be encour-
aged to site centres in schools in rural areas or peripheral urban
estates," SNP, 1999, p. 22). In contrast, the lead frame for
Scottish Labour was "the economy/tackling poverty" (23%).
In Wales, Plaid Cymru accounted for most of the refer-
ences (40.9%) to child care, followed by Welsh Labour, the
Welsh Liberal Democrats, and Conservatives (29.5%, 15.7%,
and 13.8%, respectively). Reflecting its emphasis on commu-
nity engagement/development, Plaid's lead frame is "mixed
economy of provision" (36% of party quasi-sentences; for
example, "A Plaid Government will prioritise universal,
affordable, and high quality child care, provided by a range
of deliverers, for every family in Wales," Plaid Cymru, 2007,
p. 38). In contrast, rival Welsh Labour (2007) places greatest
emphasis on "the economy/tackling poverty" (27.4%; for
example, "High quality childcare for all 2 year olds in our
most disadvantaged communities . . . This will assist those
parents who are currently economically inactive to find
employment and, thereby, to tackle one of the roots of child
poverty," p. 39). The latter reflects its strategic focus on end-
ing poverty (p .001).21
In Northern Ireland, the nationalist parties again predomi-
nate; they account for more than two thirds of all references
to child care (SDLP and Sinn Fein, each accounting for
37.5% of the regional total).22 For both, the lead frame is
"tackling poverty" (40% and 38.2% of each party's refer-
ences to child care; for example, "the SDLP views employ-
ment as a key route out of poverty which is why we must
develop affordable and sustainable childcare policies that
will allow many economically inactive people to return to
the workplace," SDLP, 2007, p. 29).
In the case of statewide parties in Scotland and Wales, the
territorialization of child care policy is also driven by intra-
party differences in both issue salience and framing (p  .05),
in other words, contrasting policy programs advanced by the
United Kingdom and "regional" divisions of the same party
(e.g., between U.K. Labour, Scottish Labour, and Welsh
Labour).23 As Laffin, Shaw, and Taylor (2007) observe, such
divergence has emerged from rapid and far-reaching institu-
tional change whereby they "have shifted significantly from
being traditional, centralized parties" (p. 88). For example,
Welsh Labour (2007) pledged, "We will provide targeted
support to help lone parents to find and stay in work, includ-
ing support for cooperative enterprises which provide emer-
gency childcare for women in work" (p. 28). Scottish Labour
made no such commitment. Instead, it promised, "by 2011
we will ensure that every early years and childcare facility
will be led by an Early Years professional" (Scottish Labour
Party, 2007, p. 18). In like fashion, the Scottish Conservatives
(2003) pledged, "we will encourage all employers to make
salary-sacrifice childcare vouchers available to their employ-
ees, and we will ensure that the public sector leads the way in
this provision" (p. 21), a commitment unmatched by their
Welsh colleagues who instead stated they would pass pri-
mary legislation in Wales whereby "small and medium sized
businesses would be rewarded for . . . providing childcare"
(Welsh Conservative Party, 2011, p. 36).
In the case of minority nationalist parties (MNPs), child
care was integral to the parties' vision of each nation. For
example, "now is the time for that new direction--a time to
build the kind of Wales we want--universal childcare . . ."
(Plaid Cymru, 2007, p. 23). child care was also expressed in
the context of their ideological goal of independence. For
example, "We will be able to address the priorities of people
in Scotland, from better state pensions to universal free
10 SAGE Open
childcare . . . Independence will allow us to make Scotland a
better place to live" (SNP, 2011, p. 37). In Wales, the dis-
course also emphasized Welsh medium child care (e.g., we
will put in place "targets for Welsh-medium educare in every
locality," Plaid Cymru, 1999, p. 18).
Discussion
The present findings highlight the discursive underpinnings
of the late-20th-century rise in child care policy in the United
Kingdom. They show a significant growth in the issue
salience of child care in the electoral discourse of the main
statewide parties in Westminster elections, thereby revealing
it to be part of the rise of valence politics. The data also show
that, across parties, child care policy is latterly framed more
in terms of social investment than as a gender equality issue.
One reading of this is that it augurs well; it signals the recon-
ciliation of the Wollstonecraft dilemma24 and the ushering-in
of a "post-feminist" era in which policy-makers have pro-
gressed from the male-breadwinner, hetero-normative
assumptions of earlier decades. On this reading, it suggests a
policy framework that supports parents and guardians
equally, regardless of sex, when seeking to balance child
raising and engagement with the labor market.
However, it is argued that the foregoing is eclipsed by
another, more worrying interpretation. For although child
care issues affect both male and female parents, collectively,
women remain the principal carers of young children
(Windebanke, 1996). Deep-set and enduring patterns and
processes of sex inequality in the labor market (Charles,
2003) mean that parties' failure to frame child care in the
context of gender equality can be seen as a key failing. Not
least, it is a derogation from the obligations of international
agreements such as CEDAW. This was highlighted in the lat-
est UN Convention Progress Report on the United Kingdom
(2013), which concluded that contemporary issues facing
women include,
The continued discrimination against women in the labour
market in terms of opportunities and equal pay; the reduction in
legal support and access to justice for women suffering
discrimination; [and] welfare reforms which are pushing more
women into poverty and insecurity. (p. 56)
Moreover, it singled out the fact that "there was no uni-
versal childcare provision," in turn, questioning, "was the
Government prepared to increase infrastructure to make
affordable childcare better available?" (p. 56).
Thus, the current manifesto data provide further empirical
backing for Lister's (2006) insightful work on New Labour
policy and disquiet related to "the construction of children as
`becomings' rather than `beings'; the paid-work-focused and
future-oriented model of citizenship; and the eclipse of par-
ents', and in particular, mothers' welfare . . . [and] principles
of (gendered) social justice" (p. 315). Moreover, the mani-
festo discourse reveals issues of inter-generational equity
and how, as Jensen (2009) cogently observes, contemporary
emphasis on social-investment "child-centred policy ideas,
[means that] the equality claims of adult women and atten-
tion to their needs are side-lined in favour of those of chil-
dren" (p. 446).
Afurther issue that emerges from the foregoing analysis is
that of territorial justice. This is the principle that unitary
states do not have sub-divisions of territory that are subject
to a different set of social rights. However, as the manifesto
discourse on child care illustrates, this principle is being
revised in the wake of devolution. This confers a unique sta-
tus on the discursive process of framing policy proposals in
party manifestos. On one hand, it is the origin of differential
child care regimes--as regional parties set out programs (and
territorial rights) that are contingent on local socio-historical
factors and reflective of regional party politics. Yet, on the
other, it is also the answer to concerns over territorial (in-)
justice, because, in democratic terms at least, it is inherently
just--owing to democratic process of elections and mandate
seeking.
Allied to the foregoing, existing work explains the resil-
ience of welfare regimes in terms of the "stickiness" of exist-
ing policy arrangements and political constituencies
associated with welfare institutions and policies (cf. Pierson,
1994). According to this view, earlier rounds of policy
choices, such as in relation to child care, become institution-
alized and tend to "crowd-out" policy alternatives.
Furthermore, over time, welfare institutions and policies
generate their own political constituencies composed of
groups such as service users, employees, and professionals.
These combine with party politics to constrain politicians'
policy choices and political options. However, the present
analysis suggests that this can be challenged by devolution
and the pluralizing of electoral systems. This is because
(quasi-)federalism introduces a new spatial policy dynamic
whereby regime resilience is also shaped by electoral dis-
course, issue salience, and policy framing. As the present
analysis shows, in multi-level systems, earlier statewide
mandated child care policies are revised over successive
election cycles as part of a discursive process, as parties
compete in placing policy proposals before voters.

 4. However, it is only possible if, as in the present case, regional
and statewide party programs have broadly similar word

Moreover, regional manifestos contain examples of policy

one under "school-based provision."

icated manifestos to set out specific policies to targeted groups
or on specific issues.
11. Prior to this date, there are isolated references to child care in
the party manifestos. However, this is not child care falling
within the definition offered at the beginning of this article.
Rather, earlier references relate to aspects of care such as resi-

family children during maternity.

women have traditionally pursued are mutually incompatible

treatment with men (which denies existing inequality and
discrimination experienced by women); the other is recogniz-
ing difference (which may be used to justify inequality; for a
discussion, see Pateman, 1989).
