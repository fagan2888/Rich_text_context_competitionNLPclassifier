Introduction
Depression has increased prevalence in persons with one or
more chronic physical illness (Patten, 2005). Among people
with depression, the presence of a chronic physical illness is
associated with an increased duration of depressive episodes
(Broemeling, Watson, & Prebtani, 2008; Kessler et al., 2003;
Ostbye et al., 2005; Patten, 2005), greater functional disabil-
ity and work absences (Stein, Cox, Afifi, Belik, & Sareen,
2006), functional decline (Schmitz, Wang, Malla, & Lesage,
2007; Stein et al., 2006; Stuck et al., 1999; Tinetti et al.,
2011), increased use of health care services (Himelhoch,
Weller, Wu, Anderson, & Cooper, 2004; Stein et al., 2006;
Unützer et al., 1997), greater disease morbidity (Saz &
Dewey, 2001; Wells & Burman, 1991), and mortality (Schulz,
Drayer, & Rollman, 2002).
Low intensity psychosocial interventions, rather than
medications, are recommended for adults with a non-severe
depression and comorbid chronic physical illness (National
Collaborating Center for Mental Health, 2009). However,
access to publicly funded psychologists is scarce in many
locations, and wait-lists are long (Lacoursière, 2011; Payne
& Myhr, 2010). Individual supported (guided) self-care or
computerized self-care treatments based on principles of
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are recommended as a
feasible alternative to traditional individual therapy (National
Collaborating Center for Mental Health, 2009). Supported
self-care interventions appear to be effective in treating
depression (Gellatly et al., 2007), although most research has
not been conducted in people with chronic physical illnesses.
Less is known about the extent to which participants adhere
to these largely self-administered treatments.
Better adherence to a range of treatments is associated with
improved health outcomes (DiMatteo, Giordani, Lepper, &
Croghan, 2002; Kazantzis, Deane, & Ronan, 2000).Adherence
is defined as the degree to which a "person's behavior--taking
medication,followingadiet,and/orexecutinglifestylechanges,
corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care

Abstract
We assessed adherence to and predictors of two components of a telephone-supported self-care intervention for depression
among primary care adults aged 40 and above with chronic physical illnesses and comorbid depressive symptoms. Participants
received a "toolkit" containing six self-care tools. Trained lay self-care "coaches" negotiated a contact schedule of up to
weekly contacts. Study outcomes were levels of completion of the self-care tool and the coach contacts at the 2-month
follow-up. Coaches reported the number of completed contacts. In all, 57 of 63 participants completed the 2-month follow-
up. Of these, 67% completed at least 1 tool; the mean number of coach contacts was 5.7 (SD = 2.4) of a possible 9 contacts
(63% adherence). Higher disease comorbidity and lower initial depression severity independently predicted better tool
adherence. Findings suggest that people with chronic physical illnesses can achieve acceptable levels of adherence to a
depression self-care intervention similar to those reported for other populations.

provider" (Sabate, 2003). In a recent systematic review of
adherence of supported self-care interventions for depression
and anxiety (Simco, McCusker, & Sewitch, 2014), among 40
studies reviewed, 22 (55%) reported any measure of adher-
ence: 18 reported the percentage of participants completing the
entire self-care tool (M = 66%, SD = 17); 13 studies reported
the amount of self-care tool completed by the average partici-
pant (M = 80%, SD = 11.6). Only four studies (18%) reported
the frequency of contacts with the self-care guide/case man-
ager. Notably, just one of these studies involved a population
with chronic physical illness as defined in the present study.
Although adherence to various medical and psychological
interventions is often associated with participant characteris-
tics--for example, illness severity, socioeconomic status, and
social support (DiMatteo, 2004; DiMatteo, Haskard, &
Williams, 2007)--only three studies evaluated the participant
characteristics associated with better adherence. Information
on predictors of adherence to self-care interventions may help
to target people most likely to benefit from this type of inter-
vention, as well as those who may require additional support.
We conducted a feasibility study of a telephone-supported
depression self-care intervention among adults aged 40 and
above with one or more of six high-impact chronic physical
illnesses (McCusker et al., 2012). The intervention had two
main components: a toolkit of paper and audiovisual tools,
and weekly telephone support from a trained lay self-care
coach. Specific objectives of the present study were (a) to
assess patient adherence at 2 months to use of the self-care
tools and coach contacts and (b) to determine predictors of
adherence to these intervention components.
Method
The study was an open, uncontrolled trial, conducted during
2010-2011.
Recruitment/Inclusion Criteria
Recruitment methods have been described previously
(McCusker, et al., 2012). Participants were recruited through
family physicians' offices within a manageable travel dis-
tance from the study site. Participants were eligible if they
were aged 40 or more, diagnosed with one or more of six
targeted high-impact chronic physical illnesses (arthritis,
hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and asthma; Broemeling et al., 2008) at
least 6 months prior to recruitment, and had at least mild
depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire­9
[PHQ-9] score  5; Simco, 2012; Spitzer, Kroenke, &
Williams, 1999). Patients were excluded if they were sui-
cidal, were receiving counseling or help at least once a month
for a mental health problem from any health professional
other than their family doctor, were unable to read in either
English or French, were more than mildly cognitively
impaired (Blessed Orientation Memory and Concentration
Test score of 10), or had a physical impairment that would
prevent the patient from participating in a self-care interven-
tion (e.g., visual impairment). Short initial screening forms
were distributed to patients by their family doctors or office
staff to ascertain age, presence of a chronic illness, and pos-
sible depression assessed by the PHQ-2 (Kroenke, Spitzer, &
Williams, 2003). Initially eligible participants were then con-
tacted by the study research assistant by telephone to confirm
study eligibility and invite them to provide written consent.
Family doctors of participating patients were instructed to
continue with usual care.
Intervention
A multi-disciplinary team of investigators designed and
conducted the intervention, which comprised two compo-
nents: providing patients a toolkit of self-care tools and
telephone-based coaching. The tools were classified into
three categories: (a) informational tools that provided infor-
mation on causes, symptoms, and available treatments for
depression (e.g., information brochure); (b) cognitive-
behavioral tools that included exercises for behavioral acti-
vation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, and/or
mood monitoring (e.g., mood-monitoring logbook); and (c)
combined tools that included both informational and cogni-
tive-behavioral elements (e.g., comprehensive antidepres-
sant skills workbook).
Six tools comprised the toolkit and were available in
English or French. They included (a) an information brochure
describing causes, symptoms, and treatments for depression
(informational tool); (b) a DVD film titled "Finding a way out
of depression" using patient and health care professional testi-
monials to describe causes, symptoms, and treatments for
depression (informational tool; Maher, 2001); (c) a mood-
monitoring logbook providing instructions and charts for daily
mood monitoring (cognitive-behavioral tool); (d) an antide-
pressant skills workbook describing causes and symptoms of
depression, providing techniques, exercises, and worksheets
for behavioral activation, recognition of depressive thoughts,
and problem solving (informational/cognitive-behavioral;
Bilsker & Paterson, 2010); (e) an action plan in booklet form,
based on material in the antidepressant skills workbook, to
encourage behavioral activation in five general areas related to
self-care for depressive symptoms and chronic illness, includ-
ing goal-setting techniques and action plan charts (cognitive-
behavioral tool; Bilsker & Paterson, 2010); and (f) Internet
tools for English-speaking participants, specifically a website,
e-couch (developed by the Australian National University), to
permit creation of a confidential account, completion of an
extensive interactive informational component on symptoms
and causes of depression, and access to modules on interper-
sonal therapy, physical activity, CBT, and problem solving.
Worksheets were provided and stored online (informational/
cognitive-behavioral; Australian National University, 2009).
An informational French-language site was provided as an
Simco et al. 3
alternative, as e-couch was only available in English (Briffault
et al., 2010).
The role of the coach was to support the participants in
using the self-care tools by encouraging them to try different
tools and facilitating their practical application. Coaches
were instructed to not engage in active therapy (e.g., making
personal/behavior change recommendations, linking behav-
ior with mood changes, etc.). Two lay coaches (A and B)
were trained using a standardized training manual and super-
vised by the study psychiatrist (author MGC) and psycholo-
gist (author KLL). The coaches offered weekly telephone
contacts with each participant for the first 3 months and once
per month for the second 3 months. Schedules for each sub-
sequent contact were re-confirmed at the end of each call.
For each scheduled contact, a window period of 5 days was
designated during which the coach could make a limited
number (3 to 5) of attempts to reach the participant. If unsuc-
cessful, that week's contact was skipped, and the following
week's contact was resumed at the regular time negotiated by
the coach and the participant. We audio-recorded all the con-
tacts and randomly reviewed a sample to assess the fidelity
of the intervention and to provide feedback to the coaches.
Ethical Issues
Written informed consent was received from all participants.
Participants who became severely depressed after enrollment
(PHQ-9 score of 20 or higher) were not withdrawn from the
study but referred to their family doctor for follow-up.
Participants who disclosed suicidal plans after enrollment
were withdrawn from the study and referred for appropriate
follow-up. The study protocol and consent procedures were
approved by the St. Mary's Hospital Research Ethics
Committee.
Potential Predictor Variables
Sociodemographics.Questions were adapted from Statistics
Canada's (2004) Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle
3.1: Educational attainment was a binary variable indicating
having obtained at least a bachelor's degree. Total household
income in the previous year, before taxes, in Canadian dol-
lars was classified as 0--no income; 1--less than $30,000;
2--$30,000 to $60,000; and 3--more than $60,000 (Statis-
tics Canada, 2004). Marital status was classified as married/
cohabiting versus other.
Physical health.Comorbidity was measured using the
self-reported Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). For the
analysis, scores 3 were combined as the same category
(Deyo, Cherkin, & Ciol, 1992; Katz, Chang, Sangha, Fos-
sel, & Bates, 1996). Physical health status and functioning
were measured by the 12-Item Short-Form (SF-12) Physi-
cal Component Summary score (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller,
1996).
Mental health.Depression severity and possible depres-
sion diagnoses (major, minor) were assessed with the PHQ-9
(Spitzer, Williams, & Kroenke, 2010). Two anxiety disorders
(panic, other) were assessed using the Primary Care Evalua-
tion of Mental Disorders diagnostic tool (Spitzer et al., 2010).
Cognitive impairment was measured using the short Blessed
Orientation­Memory­Concentration score (Katzman et al.,
1983). Mental health status and functioning were measured
by the SF-12 Mental Component Summary (Ware et al.,
1996).
Health behavior.Physical activity was measured using
Godin's Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin &
Shepard, 1997). Social network was assessed using Lubben's
Social Network Scale (Lubben et al., 2006). Activation was
calculated using the Patient Activation Measure (Hibbard,
Stockard, Mahoney, & Tusler, 2004). Adherence to medical
recommendations was determined by the General Adherence
Scale (Hays, 1994).
Adherence Outcomes
Self-care tool adherence.Self-reported tool adherence was
assessed in a telephone interview by a research assistant, 2
months after the baseline interview. Completion of each tool
was recorded on a Likert-type scale 0--none, 1--very little,
2--less than half, 3--more than half, 4--most, 5--all.
Adherence to the mood-monitoring notebook was assessed
as total number of days during the previous 2 months using a
similar Likert-type scale.
A three-level composite ordinal outcome was created
prior to data analysis to describe overall tool adherence. The
rationale behind the measure was that "high adherence"
would constitute significant use of both informational and
cognitive-behavioral tool content. Participants with high
adherence therefore completed either most to all (i.e., scores
of 4 or 5 on the Likert-type scale) of either a combined infor-
mational/cognitive-behavioral tool (the workbook or
e-couch) or most to all (i.e., scores of 4 or 5 on the Likert-
type scale) of both an informational tool (information bro-
chure or film) and a cognitive-behavioral tool (action plan or
mood monitoring). Participants with moderate adherence
completed most to all (i.e., scores of 4 or 5 on the Likert-type
scale) of either an informational or cognitive-behavioral tool.
Patients with low adherence completed less than most to all
(i.e., scores of 0 to 3 on the Likert-type scale) of all tools.
Coach contacts. Coaches recorded weekly contacts in the
coach log book. The number of coach contacts completed
at 2 months was categorized prior to data analysis to cre-
ate an ordinal outcome indicating progressive adherence to
the coach contacts schedule. Categories were high (7-9),
medium (4-6), and low (0-3) adherence.
Because coach characteristics may have affected partici-
pants' willingness to receive weekly phone contacts, we
4 SAGE Open
analyzed a series of dichotomous "yes" or "no" questions
evaluating the coaching intervention as (a) too often, (b) too
long, (c) about the right amount, (d) helpful, (e) intrusive, (f)
supportive, and (g) bothersome. In addition, participants
were asked, "Was (coach) helpful in" (a) introducing you to
the tools, (b) helping you select the tools, (c) helping you set
goals, or (d) helping you select community resources.
Statistical Analysis
To assess the impact of patient characteristics on tool and
coach adherence, we used ordered logistic regression with a
three-level outcome for each kind of adherence correspond-
ing to increasing degrees of adherence; we tested for propor-
tionality of odds ratio for both outcomes (Hosmer &
Lemeshow, 2000). All patient variables were pre-screened
by fitting univariate ordinal logistic regressions (Hosmer &
Lemeshow, 2000); only variables with a p value of .25 or less
were retained for use in multivariate model building.
The model for each outcome was constructed by stepwise
selection with backward elimination (Hosmer & Lemeshow,
2000). The proportional odds assumptions were tested in the
final models using the likelihood ratio test and also the Brant
test (Long & Freese, 2005; Wolfe & Gould, 1998). Multiple
imputation was used to handle missing predictors (Graham
& Schafer, 1999; Rubin, 1976; Schafer & Graham, 2002;
Schlomer, Bauman, & Card, 2010).
All analyses were conducted using Stata 11 (StataCorp,
2009).
Results
The recruitment flowchart is shown in Figure 1.Atotal of 254
patients completed the initial screening questionnaire, of
whom 165 (65%) completed the telephone screening. Of the
165 who completed the second screening questionnaire, 98
were eligible and provided verbal consent. Of the 63 fully
consenting participants, 57 (90%) responded to the 2-month
questionnaire. Participant characteristics indicate an older,
mostly female, and sicker sample--as the physical and men-
tal health status scores were below age-adjusted Canadian
national averages, and comorbidity scores were high (Table 1;
Hopman et al., 2000).
Self-reported completion rates of each tool are shown in
Table 2. Viewing the DVD film had the highest completion
(51%) and the Internet tool the lowest (3.5%; Table 2).

Simco et al. 5
Sixty-seven percent (38) of the participants completed all of
at least one tool; 21 of those 38 participants completed all of
1 or more behavioral tools (mood-monitoring logbook,
action plan, workbook, e-couch). Of the remaining 19, 17
started but did not complete any tool, and 2 did not start any
tool. Tool adherence was classified as high for 42% of the
participants and low for 23%. Mean (SD) coach contacts
completed was 5.7 (2.4) out of a maximum possible of 9
(63.3%). Adherence to coach contacts was classified as high
for 42% and low for 18% of the participants. The correlation
between the ordinal self-care tool adherence variable and
total number of completed coach contacts was r = .36.
Following univariate screening, four variables were
included in the stepwise selection procedure for prediction of
the ordinal tool adherence outcome: sex, social networks,
comorbidity, and depression severity. Table 3 presents cumu-
lative odds ratios representing the odds of being in a higher
adherence category compared with a lower category.
Statistically significant predictors of higher adherence in the
multivariate model were higher comorbidity and lower
severity of depression symptoms. A 1-point increase in
comorbidity score (capped at 3) was associated with a 1.67-
fold increase in the odds of higher adherence. A 1-point
increase in depression severity score was associated with an
11% decrease in the odds of higher adherence.
Five variables (comorbidity, minor and major depression
diagnosis, assigned coach, and physical activity) were
included in the stepwise selection for prediction of the ordi-
nal coach adherence outcome: Assigned coach, minor and
major depression diagnosis, and physical activity were
included in the final model, presented in Table 4. Only
assigned coach was a statistically significant predictor in the
multivariate model: Participants assigned coach B had 4.5-
fold increase in odds of higher adherence (p = .001). Means
(SDs) of completed coach contacts for CoachesAand B were
5.1 (2.5) n = 32, and 6.5 (2.2) n = 25, respectively.
Although evaluations of patient perceptions of the two
coaches revealed no significant differences, trends suggested
that Coach B was perceived to be more helpful with intro-
ducing the tools (100% vs. 93%), helping participants set
goals (87% vs. 68%), and referring participants to commu-
nity resources (68% vs. 36%) compared with Coach A.
However, Coach B was also rated as more intrusive (20% vs.
11.5%) and bothersome (20% vs. 3.6%) than Coach A. The
audiotaped recordings provided complementary informa-
tion, indicating that although both coaches adhered to the
coaching guidelines, Coach B was generally more enthusias-
tic than Coach A and gave liberal praise to the participants.
Discussion
Using an open, uncontrolled intervention study design, we
investigated adherence to a telephone-supported self-care
depression intervention in persons aged 40 and above
recruited from primary care practices with depressive symp-
toms and comorbid chronic physical illnesses. Overall, 67%
of the participants reported completion of at least one tool,
and mean completion of coach contacts was 63%. Lower ini-
tial depression scores and higher comorbidity scores were
predictors of better self-care tool adherence. Patient charac-
teristics did not predict adherence to coach calls. Moreover,
as the number of coach calls differed between the two
coaches, coaching style may be important in mediating
patient use of the support component of the intervention.
Sixty-seven percent of the participants completed at least
one entire tool in the toolkit, which was similar to the mean
completion of 66% found in our systematic review of self-
care interventions for depression or anxiety (Simco, et al.,
2014) and somewhat higher than the median percent comple-
tion of 56 reported in a systematic review of 36 studies of
computerized CBT interventions (Waller & Gilbody, 2009).
We cannot compare the low completion rate of our comput-
erized CBT tool directly to the results of the latter study,
because we presented participants with multiple tools, and
they could select the tool(s) that most appealed to them.
Completion of individual tools ranged from a high of 51%
for the DVD film and a low of 3.5% for the Internet tool,
suggesting low acceptability to the latter in this population.
The composite tool adherence outcome suggests that,
globally, the self-care intervention was acceptable, with 77%
of the participants included in the moderate-to-high adher-
ence categories. Two predictors of better tool adherence

(greater physical comorbidity and lower depression severity)
also predicted better adherence to other types of medical
treatment according to published meta-analyses (DiMatteo
et al., 2002; DiMatteo et al., 2007; DiMatteo, Lepper, &
Croghan, 2000). Greater physical comorbidity may increase
motivation to engage in self-care. However, greater severity
of depressive symptoms is associated with lower motivation.
To our knowledge, no previous study has reported data on
adherence to the self-care coach component of self-care
interventions. Eighty-two percent of the participants com-
pleted a third or more of possible coach contacts; 42%
completed two thirds to all of possible contacts, indicating
the acceptability of the coaching intervention was limited
and coach-dependent. Importantly, however, there was only
a modest correlation between tool adherence and the number
of coach calls, and no differences in tool adherence between
the two coaches. Our data on patient perceptions of the
coaches suggest that differences in coaching style may have
affected the relationship developed between the coach and
the patient (Dobkin, Sita, & Sewitch, 2006; Sewitch et al.,
2004). Further research is needed on the characteristics of
coaches that improve intervention adherence. Notably, we

have reported from this same study that adherence to the
behavioral tools--but not the number of coach calls--was
associated with better clinical outcomes (McCusker, et al.,
2012). Further research is also needed on whether the provi-
sion of coach support increases adherence to and outcomes
of self-care interventions for depression, and on the optimal
number of coach contacts needed.
Limitations
Self-reported adherence was assessed retrospectively and
was subject to recall and social desirability biases, which
likely overestimated tool adherence. However, self-report is
unavoidable when using non-electronic self-care tools. For
tools requiring mood or activity logging, reporting the num-
ber of entries made might have improved accuracy. We did
not collect data on why participants chose to use or not use a
given tool. Small sample size and the resulting low statistical
power limited the number of variables that could be entered
into the prediction models (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2000).
The highly selected patient sample may also limit the gener-
alizability of our findings.
Implications
Our findings on adherence to both the self-care tool and
coach components of our intervention are promising for the
use of this intervention in the targeted population. Further
research on depression self-care interventions is required to
confirm our findings in larger patient samples of adults with
depressive symptoms and chronic physical illnesses. We rec-
ommend that adherence to both the self-care coach and self-
care tool components be reported in future studies.Additional
areas for future research include examining the contributions
of the two intervention components to patient outcomes and
the characteristics of coaches associated with better interven-
tion adherence and outcomes. We have an ongoing random-
