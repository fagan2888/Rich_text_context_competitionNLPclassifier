Dramatic Changes in the Performance
of Endarterectomy for Diseases
of the Extracranial Arteries of the Head
Robert Pokras, MA, and Mark L. Dyken, MD
Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey have been reviewed each year to estimate the
number of endarterectomies of extracranial vessels of head and neck performed in nonfederal
hospitals in the United States. The number dramatically increased from 15,000 in 1971 to
107,000 in 1985. Regression estimates using data from 1971-1985 indicate that 127,000
procedures were expected for 1986, but the observed estimate indicated a dramatic drop to
83,000. Data reviewed suggest that on balance this reduction may have a favorable effect on
stroke mortality and morbidity. (Stroke 1988;19:1289-1290)
The purpose of this article is to report a
dramatic change in the trend for the per-
formance of carotid endarterectomy based
on updated estimates from the National Hospital
Discharge Survey (NHDS) for the United States.
Subjects and Methods
The NHDS, described in detail elsewhere,1 is a
survey of short-stay nonfederal hospitals in the 50
states and the District of Columbia. The source
document for data used in the survey is the face
sheet of the medical record. Medical and surgical
information was coded using the International Clas-
sification of Diseases (Eighth Revision in 1970-1978,2
Ninth Revision in 1979-19863). We updated the
analyses reported for 1971-19824 for 1983-1986, the
most recent data available from the NHDS.
Results
As reported, the estimated number of carotid
endarterectomies performed substantially increased
from 1971 to 1982, from 15,000 to 82,000.2 The
in-hospital mortality rate for endarterectomy patients
for these 12 years was approximately 2.8%. The
estimated number of procedures continued to

increase for 3 years after 1982, to 95,000 in 1983,
103,000 in 1984, and 107,000 in 1985. However, in
1986 a dramatic 22% decline to 83,000 occurred,
with a relative standard error of 6%. The combined
mortality rate for those 4 years was 2.6%. Figure 1
is a plot of the number of carotid endarterectomies
estimated from the NHDS for 1971-1986. A qua-
dratic regression function that describes the points
for the 15 years (y=(year-1970)2xB+A, where Y
is the predicted number of carotid endarterecto-
mies, year is the year of the estimate, and A and B
are regression coefficients) is drawn. This equation
provides an excellent fit to the data, with a coirela-
tion coefficient R of 0.993. The equation predicts
127,000 carotid endarterectomies for 1986, signifi-
cantly greater than the 83,000 procedures estimated
from the NHDS for 1986. The observed estimate of
83,000 procedures in 1986 is significantly less than
the 107,000 estimated in 1985 (p<0.01).
Discussion
In the November-December 1984 issue of Stroke,
we reported the substantial increase in the number
of carotid endarterectomies in short-stay hospitals,
from 15,000 in 1971 to 82,000 in 1982, and noted that
approximately 2.8% of the patients operated on
were discharged dead.1 In that same issue of Stroke,
three other clinical studies5-7 and an editorial8 gave
further attention to the lack of well-defined indica-
tions for the procedure and unusually high compli-
cation rates in some institutions and communities.
These concerns were supported by other studies
before and in 1985 and 1986 and have been widely
disseminated.9-'4 It is quite likely that, because of
the temporal relationship, this information may
have precipitated requests for second opinions and

that the decrease in the performance of endarterec-
tomies was in the more controversial cases.
Recently the Rand Corporation, on the basis of a
modified Delphi technique, published the results of
a random sample of 1,302 Medicare patients in three
geographic areas who had endarterectomy in 1981.15
The Rand Corporation concluded that, by their
criteria, 32% of the procedures were inappropriate
and 32% were equivocal and that the 9.8% compli-
cation rate of stroke with residual deficit or death
was so high that endarterectomy was not warranted
even in appropriate instances "because the risks
would almost certainly outweigh the benefits." If
these criteria are correct, it is hoped that our
observed decrease in the performance of endarter-
ectomy was in the inappropriate category. Unfortu-
nately, no proper study is now available to deter-
mine whether the conjectures of a Delphi panel are
correct. Regardless, in the opinion of many, these
reports are sobering enough to warrant the perform-
ance of properly designed large-scale multicenter
clinical studies to determine the exact indications
for endarterectomy and the maximal complication
rate permissible for benefit to exceed risk.
