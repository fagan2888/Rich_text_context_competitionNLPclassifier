Abstract: It is conceivable that toxic metals contribute to obesity by influencing various
aspects of metabolism, such as by substituting for essential micronutrients and vital metals,
or by inducing oxidative stress. Deficiency of the essential metal zinc decreases adiposity
in humans and rodent models, whereas deficiencies of chromium, copper, iron, and
magnesium increases adiposity. This study utilized the NHANES 99-02 data to explore the
association between waist circumference and body mass index with the body burdens of

selected toxic metals (barium, cadmium, cobalt, cesium, molybdenum, lead, antimony,
thallium, and tungsten). Some of the associations were significant direct relationships
(barium and thallium), and some of the associations were significant inverse relationships
(cadmium, cobalt, cesium, and lead). Molybdenum, antimony, and tungsten had mostly
insignificant associations with waist circumference and body mass index. This is novel
result for most of the toxic metals studied, and a surprising result for lead because high
stored lead levels have been shown to correlate with higher rates of diabetes, and obesity
may be a key risk factor for developing diabetes. These associations suggest the possibility
that environmental exposure to metals may contribute to variations in human weight gain/loss.
Future research, such as prospective studies rather than the cross-sectional studies
presented here, is warranted to confirm these findings.

1. Introduction
The marked increases in prevalence of overweight and obesity over the last several decades in the
United States poses a major public health concern [1]. Toxic metals may be conjectured to play a role in
contributing to obesity by displacing vital metals such as zinc, chromium, copper, iron, and magnesium,
which may in turn affect energy production, carbohydrate tolerance, and other metabolic process[2]. In
mice, zinc deficiency induced by a mutation in the Znt7 zinc transporter caused a reduced body weight
gain that was largely due to the decrease in body fat accumulation [3]. In contrast, deficiency of other
essential metals, chromium [4,5], copper [6], iron [7,8], and magnesium [9], causes an increase
in adiposity. The toxic metals, lead and cadmium are ubiquitous environmental toxins that are related
to a broad range of physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral dysfunctions[10,11] and recent
epidemiologic studies have reported that environmental exposure to lead or cadmium concentration
has a graded association with several disease outcomes such as hypertension, peripheral artery
diseases, kidney diseases, and cognitive impairment [12-17]. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to demonstrate an association between lead and other toxic metals and obesity.
Heavy metals are a heterogeneous group of highly reactive substances, which may act as essential
cofactors for physiologic processes and/or as toxic elements. Some metals induce oxidative stress
directly, such as iron redox-cycling between Fe3+ and Fe2+ and creating superoxide (O2
­) in the process [18].
Whereas iron (Fe), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), vanadium (V) and cobalt (Co) undergo redox-cycling
reactions under physiological conditions, other metals such as mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and
nickel (Ni), and arsenic (As) increase oxidative stress indirectly by depleting glutathione and bonding
to sulfhydryl groups of proteins [18]. The unifying factor in determining metal toxicity is the
generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [18].
The toxic metals we investigated in this study range from ubiquitous to rare in the environment.
Lead, cadmium, cobalt, antimony, and cesium are all on the 2007 CERCLA (Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) priority list of hazardous substances
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 3334
(http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/cercla/index.html). The CERCLA requires the EPA to prepare a list, in
order of priority, of substances that are most commonly found at Superfund sites (also known as the
National Priority List (NPL) sites). These contaminants are determined to pose the most significant
potential threat to human health due to their known or suspected toxicity and potential for human
exposure at these NPL sites.
As an initial exploratory inquiry, the present study investigated the association of body mass index
(BMI) and waist circumference (WC) with toxic metals adjusting for age, ethnicity, and gender via
multiple linear regressions using participants aged 6­60 across National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 99-02. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters
squared and WC is measured in centimeters. The toxic metals examined included barium, cadmium,
cobalt, cesium, molybdenum, lead, antimony, thallium, and tungsten.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Samples
We used data from the publicly available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) from 1999­2000 to 2001­2002. Collected and maintained by the US National Center for
Health and Statistics (NCHS), the data are from a cross-sectional survey designed to yield a
representative sample of the U.S. non-institutionalized civilian population. The surveys have the same
basic structure and plan, and contain age, gender, race, height, weight, and WC. Anthropometric
measures including height, weight, and WC were also obtained via the NHANES database
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/frequency/bmxdoc.pdf). In addition, the surveys are stratified
multistage probability samples based on selection of counties, blocks house-holds, and persons
within households.
Measures of metals were assessed in urine samples from one-third of participants. For this analysis,
data from two NHANES surveys were aggregated (1999­2000, 2001­2002). Metals were all measured
as individual chemicals by high resolution gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using
isotope dilution for quantification. The metals data are adjusted for serum total cholesterol
and triglycerides. In addition, the models were adjusted for the following two variables:
socioeconomic status and Creatinine. Socioeconomic status is adjusted for by including the poverty
income ratio (PIR). NHANES indicates that PIR < 1 are below the official poverty threshold and PIR
 1 are above the poverty level. Creatinine, a break down product of creatine phosphate, was used as a
controlling covariate because some heavy metals such as lead damage the kidneys and consequently
cause an increase in serum creatinine, which is normally filtered by the kidneys [19]; creatinine levels
are therefore relative measures of kidney damage. All metals levels were transformed by taking the
natural log (ln) of each in order to improve linearity and analyzed in their transformed form.
Based on relatively high prevalence in the NHANES population, which is needed for statistical
analyses, we selected nine metals: barium, cadmium, cobalt, cesium, molybdenum, lead, antimony,
thallium, and tungsten. Based on the above criteria, a total of approximately 3,816 participants with
valid BMI scores and 3,825 participants with valid WC score were used.
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 3335
2.2. Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis consisted of three regression models using all available participants testing for
associations with adiposity as assessed by BMI and WC. Two models regressed BMI and WC
respectively on gender, ethnicity, PIR, age, creatinine, and metals. All variables are included in the
model simultaneously with the first five variables acting as covariates. The third model regressed WC
on the previous predictors but controlled for BMI. These models are referred to as additive models.
Each of these models was extended by including two-way interactions between gender and metals.
All analysis, including descriptive statistics, were conducted using SUDAAN 9.01 (RTI
International, Research Triangle Park, NC) or AM Statistical Software v.0.06 (The American Institutes
for Research, DC), which estimates standard errors using the sampling weights, strata, and primary
sampling units (PSU) from NHANES allowing for the complex sampling procedures used.

Inspection of the quantities of the correlation matrix indicates that multi-collinearity is not a major
problem. The highest correlations are between creatinine and the metals, but creatinine is being used
as a control variable in the models to take into account the toxic effect of metals on creatinine on the
kidneys. After creatinine, the correlation between the metals is the next highest group. This might be
caused by a relatively high rate of co-exposures to these metals, such as via proximity to industrial
waste or incinerators.
3.2. Additive Models
Results of the additive regression models for all participants are presented in Table 3 with
corresponding least square means in Table 4.
In the model testing for the association with BMI, there are significant associations, independent of
the covariates, for ln barium, ln cadmium, ln cobalt, ln cesium, ln lead, and ln thallium, with the model
accounted for approximately 28% of the BMI variance (Table 3), with 3% of the variance uniquely
attributable to the metals. The associations are positive for ln barium and ln thallium. The significant
metal dose-responses for BMI are presented in Table 5. On the other hand, the associations are
negative for ln cadmium, ln cobalt, ln cesium, and ln lead. Age has a curvilinear association with BMI
in that BMI increases at early ages, peaks around midlife, and begins decreasing.
For testing the association with WC, there are significant associations, independent of the
covariates, for ln barium, ln cadmium, ln cobalt, ln cesium, ln lead, and ln thallium. The model
accounted for approximately 40% of the WC variance (Table 3), with 3% of the variance uniquely
attributable to the metals. The associations are positive for ln barium and ln thallium, yet negative for
ln cadmium, ln cobalt, ln cesium, and ln lead. The significant metal dose-responses for WC are
presented in Table 6. As in the previous molded for BMI, age has a curvilinear association with WC in
that WC increases at early ages, peaks around midlife, and then begins decreasing.

Because of the high association of creatinine with obesity, a second set of regression models were
estimated without using creatinine as a covariate. Results of these models are presented in Table 7.
The analyses largely indicate that the majority of results remain unchanged. The exceptions were the
parameters estimates for ln molybdenum and ln tungsten which change direction without creatinine in
the model. However, neither ln molybdenum nor ln tungsten are significant whether creatinine is used
as a covariate or not. Additionally, ln antimony became significant when creatinine was not used
as a covariate. Even so, the results remain largely unchanged whether creatinine is used as a covariate
or not.
Lead remained clearly consistent whether creatinine is used as a covariate or not. In order to see the
association of lead with BMI and WC, a regression model was estimated using only ethnicity, gender,
and age as covariates. Table 8 displays these results. The parameter for ln lead remained in the same
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 3338
direction, but it is no longer significant. So it appears that all the metals must be taken into account in
order to see the true association of ln lead with BMI and WC.

For testing the effects on WC conditional on BMI, there were no significant main associations for any
of the metals controlling for the covariates. Evidence suggests that WC is increasing in the population
and is considered as a marker for body fat distribution [20-25], hence the analysis was included.
3.3. Interaction Models
Although the joint test for the interaction between gender and all of the metals were significant for
both the BMI and WC models, the change in variance seemed trivial. Specifically, the incremental
variance due to the interactions was always less than 0.05%. For this reason, the interaction models
were not pursued.
3.4. Models for Adolescents and Adults
Because of the rapid changes of BMI from ages 6­18, the same analyses were conducted for
individuals ages 6­18 (adolescents) or 19 or older (adult). Tables 9 to 14 present the results of
these analyses. For adolescents, only barium, cobalt, and lead remained consistently significant. The
significant metal dose­responses for BMI and WC are presented in Tables 10 and 11, respectively. For
adults, with the exception of cobalt, all of the parameters estimates remained in the same direction and
those that were significant in the original model remained significant. The significant metal
dose-responses for BMI and WC are presented in Tables 13 and 14, respectively.

4. Conclusions
Our results indicate several significant associations. The toxic metals barium and thallium are
positively associated with BMI and WC, whereas cadmium, cobalt, cesium, and lead are negatively
associated with BMI and WC. Most toxic metals such as cadmium have more than one oxidation state;
accordingly the same metal may have different effects on humans [18]. Weight gain or weight loss,
depending on the toxic metal, tends to occur at much lower levels of exposure of metals than those that
make animals or humans obviously ill. For example, the CDC health concern blood lead level (BLL) is
10 g/dL, and higher levels warrant intervention such as chelation therapy, especially in children [26].
The mean BLL in the NHANES, 1999­2000, population is 2.7 g/dL and only 4.4% had BLL
concentrations above the CDC health concern level [27]. A broad range of lead levels had negative
associations with BMI and WC, suggesting that levels much lower than 10 g/dL affect these traits.
This result is consistent with studies of neurodevelopmenttal defects in children associated with low
blood lead levels that have led to call for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce the
current screening guideline of 10 g/dL [28-31]. Exposure to lead can happen from breathing
workplace air or dust, eating contaminated foods, or drinking contaminated water. Lead has been
found in at least 1,272 of the 1,684 National Priority List (NPL) sites identified by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/cercla/index.html).
The other toxic metals in this study have various sources. Exposure to barium occurs mostly in the
workplace or from drinking contaminated water. Barium and barium compounds have been found in at
least 798 of the 1,684 NPL sites identified by the EPA. Exposure to thallium occurs mainly from
eating food, but high levels of exposure may occur in the workplace. Thallium has been found in at
least 210 of 1,416 NPL sites identified by the EPA. Exposure to cadmium happens mostly in the
workplace, but lower doses are obtained from breathing cigarette smoke or eating cadmium
contaminated foods. Cadmium has been found in at least 1,014 of the 1,669 NPL sites identified by
the EPA. The general population is exposed to low levels of cobalt in air, water, and food. Cobalt has
both beneficial effects, as part of vitamin B12, and harmful effects on health at high doses. Cobalt has
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 3343
been found in at least 426 of the 1,636 NPL sites identified by the EPA. Exposure to stable or
radioactive cesium occurs from ingesting contaminated food or drinking water or breathing
contaminated air. High levels of radioactive cesium may occur after nuclear accidents or detonation of
atomic bombs. Stable (non-radioactive) cesium has been found in at least 8 of the 1,636 NPL sites and
radioactive cesium has been found in at least 23 of the 1,636 NPL sites identified by the EPA.
One possible explanation for why some toxic metals (barium and thallium) positively associate with
obesity is that they induce oxidative stress, which increases lipogenesis at the expense of energy
production [32]. Oxidative stress can be either by directly generating free radicals, in the case of
redox-cycling metals such as barium or thallium, or indirectly by non-redox cycling metals such as
lead and mercury [18]. Indirect induction of oxidative stress can be mediated by reducing glutathione
levels or by interfering with iron metabolism. Reactive oxygen species directly or indirectly generated
by metals can inhibit the normal mitochondrial metabolic function, and prevent the mitochondria from
producing energy, in the form of ATP, by oxidative phosphorylation. The lower levels of ATP,
coupled by the diminished efficacy of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle due to inhibition of enzymes
such as aconitase, which are sensitve to oxidative stress, would cause the liver to divert metabolites to
lipogenesis [32]. However, if metal-induced oxidative stress is a major cause of obesity, it is not clear
why some metals, such as barium and thallium, positively associate with obesity, whereas other
metals, such as lead, cadmium, and cesium negatively associate with obesity.
The finding that lead, cadmium, cobalt, and cesium negatively associate with obesity is surprising.
A recent study has shown that lead is a predictor of diabetic neuropathy, and that chelation therapy that
reduces the lead burden slows the rate of diabetic neuropathy [19]. Also, even in patients without
diabetes, lead chelation therapy has been shown to slow the progression of chronic renal
diseases [33,34]. Furthermore, using data from the Normative Aging Study, Tsaih and colleagues [35]
showed significant interactions of blood lead and tibia lead with diabetes and renal function. For
example, increasing the tibia lead level from the lowest to the highest quartiles was associated with an
increase in the rate of rise of serum creatinine that was 17.6 fold greater in diabetics than in
non-diabetics. The implication of this result is that lead damages the kidneys much more readily in
diabetics than in non-diabetics [35]. Our study suggests that cadmium, cobalt, and cesium might
function in a manner similar to lead in that, for whatever reason, they all negatively associate
with obesity. It will be interesting to determine whether, like lead, any of the other toxic metals in our
study positively associate with diabetic neuropathy.
However, urine lead levels, which were all that is available in the NHANES 99-02 studies analyzed
here, only reflect recent lead exposures and the abovementioned studies were careful to also analyze
total lead burden by measuring lead levels after EDTA chelation [19,33,34], which mobilizes lead
from the bone to the circulation, or X-ray analyses of bone lead [35]. Blood lead levels are only
proportional to body lead levels if there is a constant exposure to lead. However, blood lead levels
have fallen over the past three decades in the U.S. because of the elimination of leaded paint and
gasoline in the late 1970s, whereas the body burden of lead can last for several decades [36].
It is possible that the negative association between obesity and blood lead levels is misleading.
There is a positive association between creatinine levels and obesity, and several studies have shown
that body lead levels are proportional to creatinine levels because, as mentioned above, lead positively
associates with kidney dysfunction and this prevents proper filtration of creatinine, which is produced
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 3344
from creatine kinase breakdown in muscles from the blood [19,33,34]. Also, a recent study has shown
that recent severe weight loss can cause the release of stored lead from bones [37], and the weight
history of the NHANES sample is not completely known. However, as shown in Figure 1, there has
been a steady decrease in blood lead levels from 1977 to 2000 at the same time that there has been a
steady increase in obesity in the NHANES populations. This result is consistent with lead being
negatively associated with obesity. We note that Figure 1 is based on NHANES population studies,
which are cross-sectional in that both metals and outcomes are assessed at the same time. Further
prospective studies are needed to address the temporality of these findings.
In conclusion, there is, by and large, a negative association of heavy toxic metal urine
concentrations with BMI and WC. This suggests that the association of heavy metals with BMI and
WC is still unclear because the findings here are in the opposite direction of past research
and hypotheses. Future research should be further conducted in order to establish a clear understanding
of the association of heavy metals with BMI and WC.
