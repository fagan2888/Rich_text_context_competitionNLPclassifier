Perceptual and Motor Skills
Introduction
As research has shown in the past few decades, a person's
social judgment is often influenced by motivational and cog-
nitive biases that compromise objectivity in social percep-
tions (for reviews, see Gilovich, 1991; Nisbett & Ross,
1980). Despite this evidence of existing biases in social judg-
ment, people often fail to recognize those biases in their own
social judgments, even while they detect them in judgments
made by others (bias blind spot: Pronin, Lin, & Ross, 2002).
This asymmetry in bias perception has been attributed to
"naive realism" (e.g., Pronin et al., 2002), a conviction that one
perceives objects and events "as they are"--in other words,
that there is an objective reality that is in a one to one corre-
spondence with one's own perceptions (Ross & Ward, 1995,
1996). According to this construct, the reason we assume our
social judgments are free from bias is because we believe that
"we see the thing as it is" (for a review, see Pronin, Gilovich, &
Ross, 2004). However, this explanation for the unawareness of
biases in one's own judgments is only a theoretical assumption
that has not been well explored experimentally.
Prior research has hinted at possible factors that may con-
tribute to sustaining unrealistic personal beliefs when making
social judgments. First, people are seldom confronted with
events that illustrate judgment inaccuracies. Daily life may be
too complex to permit clear determinations of judgment accu-
racy. Although people may occasionally be confronted with
instances that question their sense of objectivity (e.g., other
people responding to issues and events differently), they tend
to focus on information that supports their own opinions and
deny the validity of contradictory information (confirmatory
bias; Lord, Ross, & Lepper, 1979). Thus, it is plausible to
assume that people will not notice their susceptibility to
biases without confronting clear demonstrations of their own
false or inaccurate perceptions.
Perceptions vary on a continuum from simple ones (e.g.,
sensory perception of physical objects) to complex ones
(e.g., opinions in politics). Some researchers have pointed to
the possibility that certainty in sensory perception plays a
role in driving human overconfidence in one's own social
judgment. Ishii (2005) and Pronin et al. (2004) pointed out
that naïve realism of "I see the world as it is" may cause few
difficulties in daily life insofar as our concern is with the
experience of physical objects. In addition, Pronin et al.
(2004) suggested that the "naïve realism conviction began
with physical perception and generalized to complex social
events and political issues" (p. 783).
Banaji and Greenwald (2013) suggested that biases in social
judgments and errors in sensory perception are similar because
both are the results of unconscious and automatic mental work
that consists of their perceptions.According to them, "it (visual
illusion) serves as a vivid illustration of a signal property of the

Effects of Experiencing Visual Illusions
and Susceptibility to Biases in One's Social
Judgments
Ayumi Kambara
Abstract
Despite the evidence for existing biases in social judgment, people often fail to recognize biases in their own social judgments.
This study investigated whether people become aware of their own susceptibility to various biases by experiencing visual
illusions that challenge confidence in personal perceptions. A total of 88 participants were grouped by whether or not
they gazed at illusory motion graphics and by whether they rated themselves or others on bias susceptibility. Participants
who gazed at visual illusions rated themselves as having more biases in their social judgments than participants who did not
see visual illusions. These findings suggest that bias denial may partially result from insufficient opportunities to recognize
inaccuracies in personal perceptions.

mind--it does a great deal of its work automatically, uncon-
sciously, and unintentionally" (Banaji & Greenwald, 2013, p.
5). Thus, visual illusion might be a good example of uncon-
scious processes constructing human perception.
One study (Hart, Tullett, Shreves, & Fetterman, 2015)
tested the effect of reminding people of their unconscious
and automatic mental work on their confidence in their social
judgment. In their study, participants who were not only
given explanations of unconscious and automatic mental
work but were also exposed to optical illusions lost confi-
dence in their social judgment, as compared with participants
who were only given the explanations. With this result, it is
not clear whether experiencing optical illusions only without
any explanations is effective, and why people become less
confident of their social judgment; however, this result seems
to imply that it might be difficult for people to dismiss first-
hand experiences of sensory perception error rather than
mere warnings about their subjectivity.
In the context of these arguments, it was hypothesized
that people become more aware of their susceptibility to
biased perceptions if they encounter clear demonstrations
that personal sensory perceptions are not necessarily accu-
rate. To test this hypothesis, visual illusions were used as
stimuli to target and challenge habitual reliance on personal
sensory perceptions. Unlike Hart et al. (2015), explanations
of naïve realism were not used as stimuli in this study.
Visual illusions are characterized by visually perceived
images that convincingly differ from objective reality and
physical properties (Kitaoka, 2008). At least momentarily,
experiencing visual illusions would remind a viewer of per-
sonal fallibility in sensory perception, as this is a condition
when viewers are able to recognize the mismatch between a
perceived image and objective reality.
Among the various types of visual illusions, motion illu-
sions were used as stimuli in this experiment. Motion illu-
sion is an optical illusion in which a static image appears to
be moving due to the cognitive effects of interacting color
contrasts and shape position (Goldstein & Brockmole, 2016).
Therefore, people would be naturally aware that their per-
ception of motion should not reflect the physical properties
of a real-world object when an illusory motion graphic is
printed on a sheet of paper; this is because such graphics
cause people to perceive "moving" graphics even while they
are simultaneously aware that the graphics illustrated on a
sheet of paper should not be actually moving. Both the
appearance of the presented graphics and their feeling about
the appearance of the presented graphics were confirmed as
a manipulation check in this study.
Our goal was to investigate whether people might better
realize their own susceptibility to various biases in their own
social judgments if they encounter clear demonstrations of
their own sensory perception errors. To achieve this goal, the
effect of visual illusion on susceptibility to various biases in
both own and average others' social judgments was exam-
ined. If, as predicted, exposure to errors in their OWN sen-
sory perception makes people aware of the uncertainty of
their OWN perception, experiencing illusion affects suscep-
tibility to biases only in their OWN social judgment, but not
in OTHERS' social judgment. This is because uncertainty
about their OWN sensory perception might relate to uncer-
tainty about their OWN social perception, while uncertainty
about their OWN sensory perception has nothing to do with
uncertainty about OTHERS' social perception. Even if there
is a slight possibility that uncertainty about one's OWN per-
ception caused by visual illusion generalized to that of
OTHERS' perception, confronting visual illusion would not
induce incremental awareness of biases in OTHERS' social
judgment. This is because, as previously mentioned, it is well
known that people do not believe the objectivity of OTHERS'
social perception from the beginning; people are usually
aware of biases in OTHERS' social judgment without being
exposed to visual illusion (Pronin et al., 2002).
Method
Participants
Eighty-eight undergraduates (age range = 19-23; M = 20.72,
SD = 1.08; 38 male, 50 female) from a university in western
Japan participated in this study. Participants were recruited
either in public spaces on the university campus (n = 65) or
in the classroom (n = 23). All participants were provided
with snacks as compensation for taking part in the study.
FollowingtheethicalguidelinesoftheJapanesePsychological
Association, all participants were informed that their
responses would be anonymous and that they could with-
draw at any time during the study.
Experimental Design
A 2 (visual illusion exposure vs. no exposure) × 2 (Ratings of
Self vs. Ratings of Other) factorial between-subjects design
was used. Participants were randomly divided into four
groups: (a) visual illusion exposure-Rating of Self (n = 22),
(b) no exposure-Rating of Self (n = 22), (c) visual illusion
exposure-Rating of Other (n = 21), and (d) no exposure-Rat-
ing of Other (n = 23).
Procedure
The experiment was conducted in small groups (two or four
people) who were told that they would take part in an "evalu-
ation of pictures and persons' impressions" right at the outset.
Experimental manipulation: Challenging habitual reliance on
sensory perception.Half of the participants received book-
lets that consisted of three pieces of paper, with one illu-
sory motion graphic printed on each page. These images are
provided in Appendix A. The other half received the same
booklet, but with control graphics that were similar to the
illusory motion graphics in color and shape, but without
any motion illusion (see Appendix B). Participants were
Kanbara 3
told to fix their eyes on the graphics until the experimenter
cued them to go to the next page. Participants gazed at each
graphic for 40 s. Participants were told that they would be
asked to provide their thoughts on the graphics later.
Measurement of perceived bias.Next, participants were
asked to respond to each item on a bias impression question-
naire. This questionnaire began with "Psychologists have
claimed that people in general show the tendencies described
below." Seven specific motivational and cognitive biases were
described: self-serving attribution for success versus failure,
dissonance reduction after making a free choice, the positive
halo effect, biased assimilation of new information, reactive
devaluation of proposals from one's negotiation counterparts,
the fundamental attribution error (FAE) in "blaming the vic-
tim," and judgments about the "greater good" that were influ-
enced by personal self-interest. These seven biases were taken
from previous research on the "bias blind spot" (Pronin et al.,
2002).1 All the descriptions used the neutral term "effect" or
"tendency" rather than the nonneutral term "bias." For exam-
ple, self-serving attribution bias was described as
a tendency to regard successes as the result of personal qualities,
such as drive or ability, but to regard failures as the result of
external factors, luck or some type of situational cause.
Half of the participants from each of the visual illusion
exposure and no exposure groups were asked about their
own susceptibility to each of the seven biases (i.e., "To what
extent do you believe that you show this tendency?") while
the other half of each group were asked about the susceptibil-
ity of an imagined average student at the same university to
these biases (i.e., "To what extent do you believe that other,
average students show this tendency?"). Ratings were made
on a 9-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 9 (strongly).
Finally, participants were asked to respond to two ques-
tions intended to confirm how the illustrations had appeared
to the participants, and how they had felt about the appear-
ance of the illustrations. The first question asked participants
to answer how the illustration looked by making a selection
from three options (1. in motion, 2. not sure, and 3. at rest).
The second question asked the degree of surprise the partici-
pants experienced by the appearance of the illustrations.
"How surprised were you about how the illustrations looked?
If you saw an illustration that looked like it was moving/at
rest, how surprised were you about it?" This question was
scored on a Likert-type rating scale (1 = not at all surprised,
5 = extremely surprised). Last, participants were questioned
regarding their awareness of the experiment's purpose using
the following questions: "What do you think the purpose of
the experiment was?" and "What do you think this experi-
ment was trying to study?"
Analysis.Each participant's responses to the seven bias
items were averaged to create a bias perception index for
that participant. To examine the main prediction, a 2 (self
vs. other) × 2 (illusion vs. control) analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed on the composite scores of the
bias perception measure.
Results
Just as planned, data from any participants who failed to com-
plete the questionnaire (n = 6) or who expressed thoughts about
the two studies being related (n = 1) in the questions probing
for awareness of the experiment's purpose were excluded. In
addition, responses from participants who evaluated the control
graphics as moving were removed (n = 4), resulting in a final
sample size of 77 students.2,3 The number of participants in
each condition was then 18 participants in the control/self-rat-
ing condition, 21 participants in the control/other rating condi-
tion, 19 participants in the illusion/self-rating condition, and 19
participants in the illusion/other rating condition.
Manipulation Checks
Participants reported being more surprised by the illusion
condition than by the control condition (control: M = 1.33,
SD = 0.66; illusion: M = 3.05, SD = 1.27), t(55.36) = ­7.41,
p < .0001, d = 1.70, indicating that illusion group participants
were more personally and emotionally impacted by the expe-
rience of gazing at visual illusions than were the control
group participants who did not have this exposure.
Participants' responses to the measurement of the per-
ceived bias of the seven bias items were reliable (Cronbach's
 = .79). Each participant's responses to those seven bias
items were averaged to create a bias perception index for
each participant. Examination of the bias perception scores
in the control condition revealed that participants who rated
their own bias susceptibility gave lower bias ratings than did
participants who answered in terms of the average student
(self: M = 3.74, SD = 1.21; others: M = 5.83, SD = 0.97),
t(37) = ­5.98, p < .0001, d = 1.91. This finding is consistent
with the results of previous studies (e.g., Pronin et al., 2002),
and it replicates naïve realism.
Dependent Measure
Participants' bias perception scores were analyzed using a 2
(target: self vs. other) × 2 (presented graphics: illusion vs. con-
trol) between-subjects ANOVA. There was a main effect of
target, indicating that participants in the Rating of Self condi-
tion, compared with those in the Rating of Other condition,
perceived the target as more biased, F(1, 73) = 36.87, p < .0001,
p
2 = .34. There was no main effect of the presented graphics,
F(1, 73) = 1.74, ns, p
2 = .02.
These main effects were qualified by a significant inter-
action, F(1, 73) = 4.82, p < .05, p
2 = .06. Consistent with
our hypotheses, simple-effects tests showed that perceived
susceptibility to bias in one's own social judgments were
higher among the participants in the illusion condition than
the participants in the control condition (control: M = 3.74,
4 SAGE Open
SD = 1.21; illusion: M = 4.63, SD = 1.33), F(1, 73) = 5.95,
p < .05, p
2 = .08. In contrast, perceived susceptibility to
bias in average others' social judgment did not show any
group difference between the control condition and the illu-
sion condition, F(1, 73) < 1, ns, p
2 = .01.
Comparing the bias perception scores about oneself and
others in the illusion condition, participants who rated them-
selves reported less bias susceptibility than did the participants
who rated average others (self: M = 4.63, SD = 1.33; others:
M = 5.61, SD = 0.87), F(1, 73) = 7.44, p < .01, p
2 = .09. The
results are reported in Figure 1.
Discussion
First, in the control group, the participants who rated themselves
perceived less bias than those who rated others. This confirms
the "bias blind spot" and replicates the results from previous
research (Pronin et al., 2002). As exposure to visual illusions
increased awareness of bias in one's own social judgments, our
primary prediction was also supported. This implies that lack of
opportunity to experience clear gaps between personal percep-
tion and objective reality might be contributing to unawareness
of biases in one's own social perception. The increased percep-
tion of bias was not merely an effect of experiencing visual illu-
sions because the incremental change in the perception of bias
due to exposure to illusory images was found only in the self-
rating condition, not in the other-rating condition.
While exposure to visual illusions was shown to increase
the awareness of bias in one's own social judgments, partici-
pants perceived fewer biases in their own social judgments
than in those of an average student even after being exposed
to visual illusions. Therefore, exposure to visual illusions can
be said to influence bias perception in one's own social judg-
ment, but its influence is insufficient to make the bias blind
spot completely disappear.
A question concerned with the ways by which people
realize the existence of bias has been proposed: "Under
what circumstances do people seem to recognize rather than
overlook or deny their susceptibility to bias?" (Kennedy &
Pronin, 2008). However, few empirical studies have sought
to investigate the ways and circumstances that enable peo-
ple to recognize biases and thereby advance this research.
One study (Pronin & Kugler, 2007) showed that people
were more likely to acknowledge their own susceptibility to
various social biases after reading an article about the
unconscious mental work that shapes human behavior and
judgment. The present study used an experiential task
instead of an explanation task to remind participants that
personal perceptions do not always reflect objective reality.
Limitations of the present study and its implications are as
follows. First, in this study, it was assumed that confronting
the gap between one's perceived image and objective reality in
sensory perception causes one to recognize that one's own
social perceptions are not necessarily an accurate reflection of
the social world. As previously mentioned, the result of Hart
et al. (2015) also seems to imply that there is a relationship
between regarding one's social perception as absolute and
experiencing optical illusion. However, the present study does
not provide direct evidence for these underlying mechanisms.
Further study will be needed to clarify this mechanism.
Second, the results presented here showed only short-
term effects, and it remains unclear how long these effects
might last. Even though almost all people have previously
experienced visual illusions, they still tend to believe that
they are free from bias. Future research might address the
duration of this effect and what may be needed to show long-
term effects.
Conclusion
Overall, the current study showed that people become aware
of various biases in their own social judgment by experienc-
ing visual illusions that remind them of uncertainty in their
sensory perceptions. Seeking ways to have people acknowl-
edge their subjectivity would be meaningful for mutual
understanding, because the blindness to biases in one's own
social judgment was reported as one of the causes for inter-
personal conflicts when people have opposing views
(Kennedy & Pronin, 2008; Pronin, Kennedy, & Butsch,
2006; Reeder, Pryor, Wohl, & Griswell, 2005).
However, this article was not designed to argue that over-
confidence in one's sense of social objectivity should always
be undermined. In ordinary life, doubting one's own percep-
tion, especially doubting every single instance of one's own
sensory perception, would bring us a substantial amount of
inconvenience. Considering the point that many cognitive
errors that arise do support personal, societal, or even evolu-
tionary advantages (Haselton & Buss, 2000), blindness to
one's own biases might be a product or by-product of adapta-
tion (e.g., reducing cognitive loads). With this point of view,
further studies need to explore ways and mechanisms that
make people realize their subjectivity without those adaptive
sides, if any, impaired.

Notes
1. In this study, hostile media bias, which is one of the eight
biases used in the reference study (Pronin, Lin, & Ross, 2002),
was not used as one of the general biases. This is because there
is not enough evidence of this kind of bias in Japan. The other
seven specific biases, which have been widely acknowledged
in Japan, were put in the questionnaire.
2. All measures, conditions, and data exclusions have been
reported.
3. It was intended a priori to exclude participants who saw
the two studies as related. However, it was not expected
that there would be participants who evaluated the control
graphic as moving. The participants who saw the control
graphics as moving were not really considered as a control
group because it seems that those participants, as with the
participants in the illusion condition, felt the gap between
their own perceived image (graphics on a sheet of paper
look as if they are moving) and objective reality (no graph-
ics on a sheet of paper should move). Accordingly, it was
decided to exclude those four participants from the analysis.
Although both the participants who evaluated the motion
illusion graphic as static and the participants who saw the
two studies as related were included in the data analysis,
the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results did not show any
change: interaction: F(1, 78) = 5.32, p < .05, p
2 = .06; main
effect of graphics: F(1, 78) = 1.58, ns, p
2 = .02; main effect
of target: F(1, 78) = 41.40, p < .0001, p
2 = .35.
