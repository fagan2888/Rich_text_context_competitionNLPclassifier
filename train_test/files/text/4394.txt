Article
It is well established that Black women are at greater risk for
preterm birth (PTB) and infant mortality than other race/eth-
nicities in the United States, particularly in the south.
Evidence exists supporting the effects of adequate prenatal
care to significantly reduce the risk of PTB among this vul-
nerable population (Debiec, Paul, Mitchell, & Hitti, 2010;
Picklesimer, Billings, Hale, Blackhurst, & Covington-Kolb,
2012). However, Black mothers are 2.3 times more likely
than White mothers to receive prenatal care late, or not at all
(Office of Minority Health [OMH], 2015). Rationale for this
trend remains unclear. The purpose of this article is to exam-
ine how current literature addresses Black women's experi-
ence of antenatal care, including the role that midwives may
have in that care. A brief history of Black midwives and their
role as the major health care providers for Black women, as
well as the current trends in midwifery, will provide back-
ground and offer a point of reference. While much of the lit-
erature focuses on birth outcomes, provider qualities, and
situational life factors in conjunction with the prenatal care
received by Black women, very few investigate the effects
that historical underpinnings may have played in Black
women's current reception of prenatal care. The history of
Black women's health care and the prominent role that mid-
wifery played is all but forgotten.
Throughout this review, the term Black is used rather
than African American as birth certificate data and much of
the early demographic data use the term Black as a racial
indicator.
Background
Antenatal care for Black women was historically provided
by Black midwives from the 1600s to the mid-1900s
(Robinson, 1984; Tunc, 2010). These midwives were the pri-
mary health care providers to Black women and were often
called on to assist White women in the south during birth
(Tunc, 2010). Approximately 50% of all U.S. births in 1900s
were attended by midwives (Devitt, 1979). By 1935, 12.5%
of all births in the United States were attended by midwives,
while more than half of all Black births were still attended by
midwives (Tandy, 1937). The decline of midwifery among
the Black population was precipitated by the Sheppard­
Towner Act of 1921, resulting in widespread regulation of
the Black midwives in the South who, by this time, were the
largest percentage of active midwives (Devitt, 1979; Tandy,
1937). Furthermore, in 1948, there was a push to standardize
medicine and eliminate lay healers, which gained momen-
tum around the time the American Medical Association
(AMA) was formed (Robinson, 1984). Many women during
this period of transition switched their method of antenatal

Midwifery and Antenatal Care for Black
Women: A Narrative Review
Hannah Yoder1 and Lynda R. Hardy2
Abstract
Non-Hispanic Black mothers are 2.3 times more likely than White mothers to receive delayed or no prenatal care. Black
women possess a long history of midwifery-led care, but there is a recent absence in the literature about the role of
midwifery in this population. This systematic review elucidates the state-of-the-science regarding Black women's experience
of antenatal care, including the role of midwives. Sixteen articles identified through CINAHL and PubMed databases were
included using specific parameters. Three themes were used to identify Black Women's antenatal care perceptions: (a)
care disparities, (b) perceptions of antenatal care, and (c) midwifery-led care. Major literature gaps include Black women's
perception of midwifery as an antenatal care option and the experience and practice of Black midwives today. Understanding
Black women's views of midwifery will enable providers to deliver antenatal care options that facilitate improved outcomes
for Black women and their neonates.

care from midwives to physicians (Tunc, 2010). This trend,
along with the subsequent regulation from the Sheppard­
Towner Act, resulted in the gradual elimination of many
Black midwives. By 1972, only 1% of all births in the United
States were attended by midwives (Devitt, 1979).
Interest in midwifery-attended birth is resurging, as
recently noted by the American College of Nurse-Midwives
(ACNM).AACNM (2014) report titled "CNM/CM-Attended
Birth Statistics in the United States" stated that 12.1% of all
vaginal births in the United States were attended by certified
nurse-midwives (CNMs) and certified midwives (CMs).
ACNM's numbers do not reflect the practice of certified pro-
fessional midwives, so the actual percentage of midwife
assisted births may be slightly higher. Despite Black wom-
en's significant heritage surrounding midwifery, the trend
toward midwife-attended births today is higher among Non-
Hispanic White women. In 2014, 11% of all White, live
births were attended by CNMs/CMs, whereas 8% of Black,
live births were attended by CNMs/CMs (HealthData.gov,
2014). This is a sharp contrast to the mid-1900s when nearly
50% of all Black births were attended by midwives.
The demographic characteristics of members of the
ACNM also mirror this trend. In all, 88% of the CNMs, CMs,
and students enrolled inACNM certified programs are White,
and 3.6% are Black (Schuiling, Sipe, & Fullerton, 2005). The
capacity for enrollment into nurse accredited nurse-midwifery
programs remained stable since 2013, according to a 2015
report from ACNM; however, graduates from these programs
continued to grow, reaching nearly 600 in 2014 at a growth
rate of 5.6%. This increase saw an increase in diversity of
nurse-midwives in all races ranging from 16.1% in Hispanic/
Latino to 250% in Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders.
There was an 18.1% rise in the increase of Black midwifery
students (ACNM, 2015). The upward trend in the number of
practicing midwives as well as the increase in diversity among
midwives is encouraging; however, there is still a notable
gap, both in the literature and in practice, regarding Black
women and current use of midwives.
Method
Searches for both qualitative and quantitative research pub-
lished in peer reviewed journals were conducted through
CINAHL and PubMed databases using combinations of
search terms "infant mortality," "preterm birth," "antenatal,"
"prenatal," "midwife," "black midwife," "granny midwife,"
"African American OR Black women," and "preferences."
Publications selected for final review included a broad range
of research designs including experimental, case controlled,
phenomenological, cross-sectional, and ethnographic studies
meeting four inclusion criteria: (a) published between 2006
and 2017, (b) conducted in the United States, (c) included a
minimum of 13% participation by Black women, and (d)
addressed antenatal care. Research conducted outside the
United States or conducted within the United States among
immigrant Black women was excluded because of the cul-
tural differences between U.S. born Black women and Black
women born outside of the United States. The threshold of
13% Black women was selected to ensure the data adequately
represented the perceptions and experiences of Black women.
This percentage is the national average of women who iden-
tify as Black. Preliminary analysis indicated a lack of
research focused primarily on midwives and Black women;
therefore, final analysis was conducted on research address-
ing Black women's antenatal care, regardless of provider
type. In all, 18 studies were identified using these search cri-
teria; however, two studies were not included in the analysis
because they were based on data collected from the late
1900s. These were "Disparity in Prenatal Care Among
Women of Colour in the USA" by Park, Vincent, and
Hastings-Tolsma and "Women's Narratives on Quality in
Prenatal Care: A Multicultural Perspective" by Wheatley,
Kelley, Peacock, and Delgado. Final analysis was conducted
on 16 studies.
Results
Eight of the 16 articles gathered for review were quantitative
research. Of these eight, three sampled Black women exclu-
sively, two sampled both Black and Latino women, and three
sampled White, Black, and Latino women. Four of these
studies addressed the role of midwives in prenatal care. The
remaining eight studies were qualitative research. Six of the
qualitative studies enrolled an exclusively Black population,
and the remaining two sampled multiple races. Three specifi-
cally addressed midwife involvement in prenatal care. There
was some geographic diversity among the studies ranging
from locations in the Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, and
Midwest, with a few utilizing data from multiple sites across
the United States.
Quantitative research used well-defined study design and
analytics. One quantitative study used data from two sepa-
rate randomized controlled trials, five were case controlled
studies, and two utilized cross-sectional design. Of the eight
qualitative studies, four were phenomenological and the
remaining four were ethnographic, grounded theory, com-
parative case study, and narrative, respectively. Three main
themes specific to Black women's experience of antenatal
care were identified throughout the literature: (1) care dis-
parities that affect quality and frequency of antenatal care for
Black women, including subthemes (a) discrimination and
(b) other influences; (2) Black women's perceptions and
preferences related to their antenatal care; and (3) midwifery-
led care for Black women. These themes were identified
through careful perusal of the publication provided data and
conclusions, focusing on the aspects of antenatal care that
affected or had the potential to affect Black women's experi-
ence of that care. Many of the studies had overlapping pur-
poses; for example, several of the qualitative interview
studies addressed prenatal care preferences, care disparities,
Yoder and Hardy 3
and discrimination within the same study. In addition,
although discrimination is correlated with disparity in care, it
was identified as an individual subtheme of importance
because it also appeared to correlate with satisfaction and
antenatal health.
Care Disparities
The literature suggests discrimination as a primary factor
affecting the quality of antenatal care, in addition to other
stressful life events, limited access to care, drug and alcohol
use (linked to stress), and late initiation of prenatal care.
These care disparities correlated with adverse birth outcomes
such as preterm and stillbirths.
Discrimination. Racial discrimination, affecting the quality of
prenatal care, is found in both the health care system and
everyday encounters. Two qualitative studies performed in
two separate communities in Florida linked racial discrimi-
nation in the health care system to fewer prenatal visits
(Close, Suther, Foster, El-Amin, & Battle, 2013; Salm Ward,
Mazul, Ngui, Bridgewater, & Harley, 2013). Research par-
ticipants described negative preconceptions held by health
care as a deterrent to care, such as assuming they used illicit
drugs because they were Black (Ward et al., 2013). Partici-
pants also reported the perception of receiving a different,
lower quality of care than White women received (Close
et al., 2013). Nearly all the Black women mentioned long
waiting periods, occasionally 3 to 4 hr after arriving at a
clinic. A few felt that White patients waited shorter periods
of time for care (Close et al., 2013; Daniels, Noe, & May-
berry, 2006; Savage, Anthony, Lee, Kappesser, & Rose,
2007). Each of these studies was conducted with few partici-
pants in specific communities, which does not allow for
strong external validity per each individual study. However,
examining the common experiences of these Black women
over all the studies together, and given the geographic diver-
sity--two in Florida, one in Georgia, and one in Ohio--the
similarities suggest that the experiences of these women may
not be limited to their individual communities. Another qual-
itative study among compared differences between two
groups of Black women of low socioeconomic status--late
and early initiators of prenatal care--noting perceptions of
discrimination or insensitivity in the clinic were most com-
mon among late initiators (Daniels et al., 2006). Across all
these studies, discrimination in the clinics coincides with
reduced desire to return regularly.
The stress of discrimination is also linked with an
increased incidence of PTB (Rankin, David, & Collins, 2011;
Ward et al., 2013). This stress was succinctly expressed by a
female participant: " . . . it's been like this forever. You learn
to go last. No matter how much people talk about it, it is the
same . . ." (Ward et al., 2013, p. 1757). A case control study
surveying 277 Black women delivering at a hospital in
Chicago found that those who delivered preterm were more
likely to report daily incidents of discrimination than women
who delivered full term. Interestingly, the research suggested
that subtle forms of discrimination such as being talked down
to or hearing surprise expressed over one's intelligence or
industriousness was more strongly related to PTB than other
forms (Rankin et al., 2011). This finding may be attributed to
the possibility that these "subtle" forms of discrimination are
more frequent because they are not as easily recognized as
such by the majority culture.
Environment and negative health behaviors.Environmental
factors such as stressful life events and access to care were
also addressed as affecting both birth outcome and regular
prenatal care. Per Hogue et al. (2013), in a population case
control study, Black women were more likely than White
women to have financial, emotional, and partner-related
stressors, and women experiencing financial and partner-
related stressors were at increased odds for stillbirths. This
was an extensive study collecting data from 59 community
academic hospitals from several different states (Hogue
et al., 2013). Transportation and access to care were identi-
fied stressors noted by participants as the second most fre-
quent barrier to receiving prenatal care (Close et al., 2013).
Transportation barriers identified by participants in an ethno-
graphic study located in Ohio ranged from inability to afford
a car to long and inconvenient bus schedules (Savage et al.,
2007). Participants stated that the few clinics located near
their homes were often busy, and traveling to a hospital or
more accessible clinic was time intensive (Close et al., 2013;
Savage et al., 2007). The negative outcomes of these stress-
ors coupled with the effects of discrimination already dis-
cussed above suggest a significant burden of disparity that
Black women face to have a healthy pregnancy.
A health behavior addressed in several studies that affects
birth outcomes of Black women was drug and alcohol use. It
is well documented that use of drugs and alcohol during the
prenatal period increases incidents of adverse birth outcomes
(National Institute of Health, 2012). Among three qualitative
studies that interviewed Black women concerning their
thoughts on prenatal care, drug and alcohol use was a recur-
ring theme (Close et al., 2013; Daniels et al., 2006; Savage
et al., 2007). Participants in the Savage et al. (2007) ethno-
graphic study described knowing other Black women in their
neighborhood who used drugs and alcohol during pregnancy,
although none of the Black women interviewed admitted to
drug use. Drug and alcohol use appeared to be a greater prob-
lem among pregnant teens and women who were under sig-
nificant stress (Close et al., 2013).
Perceptions of Antenatal Care
Most of the qualitative studies identified Black women's per-
ceptions about their antenatal care, provider experiences, and
view on pregnancy. These perceptions often defined how
they experienced antenatal care.
4 SAGE Open
Knowledge deficit, or the perception that prenatal care
was unnecessary, was not cited as a major issue. Most Black
women reported their awareness of the value of prenatal
care, even if they did not receive regular prenatal care them-
selves. Some voiced frustration that although they under-
stood how to appropriately care for themselves and regularly
attended prenatal visits, their infants still were born with
complications (Close et al., 2013). There were a few study
participants, however, who mentioned lack of knowledge as
a deterrent of prenatal care for other women they knew
(Daniels et al., 2006). In addition, a study conducted by
Tucker Edmonds, Mogul, and Shea (2015) found that the use
of ultrasounds increased the perception of value of prenatal
care by low-income Black women.
Perception of providers was another theme noted in the
literature. A study interviewing low-income Black women in
Philadelphia found that the women perceived lack of personal
relationships and discontinuity of care with their physicians,
while appreciating the relationships they formed with the
nursing staff they saw on a repeated basis (Tucker Edmonds
et al., 2015). Conversely, a study implemented in Detroit
among a sample of Black women failed to find that trust in
providers differed significantly between CNMs and physi-
cians (Peters, Benkert, Templin, & Cassidy-Bushrow, 2014).
How Black women perceived their pregnancy played a
significant role in how they approached prenatal care.
Women who reported feeling disinterested, depressed, or
devastated about their pregnancy were more likely to initiate
prenatal care late, or not at all (Daniels et al., 2006; Tucker
Edmonds et al., 2015). Several studies suggest that an
unplanned or unwanted pregnancy may have a negative
effect on a Black woman's pursuit of antenatal care (Daniels
et al., 2006; Savage et al., 2007; Tucker Edmonds et al.,
2015). Savage et al. (2007), in their ethnographic study, men-
tioned that unplanned pregnancies could be felt by Black
mothers to be an interruption to future plans, such as higher
education. A closely related study conducted in a predomi-
nantly Black Florida community recorded participant's
views suggesting that the tendency for Blacks within the
community to place less importance on planning pregnancies
than White women was related to a difference in cultural
mentality--dealing with events as they happen (Close et al.,
2013). The effect of an unwanted pregnancy had the propen-
sity to cause such significant distress that the woman might
intentionally avoid prenatal care (Savage et al., 2007).
The findings from the literature substantially point toward
numerous factors that lead to decreased prenatal care for
Black women. Women acknowledged that late prenatal care
was a problem in their communities, and cited discrimination,
inaccessibility to clinics, mistrust of medical providers, and
unplanned or unwanted pregnancies as main reasons they or
other women might initiate late prenatal care. Besides affect-
ing incidences of PTB, late or no prenatal care can also affect
the postpartum health of the mother and child, as it is corre-
lated with decreased incidences of postnatal and well-child
visits.Aretrospective/prospective urban study that followed a
sample of low-income Black women after delivery for a year
found that women who attended prenatal visits were more
statistically more likely to attend postnatal visits and well-
child checkups. About 50% of the women who did not attend
prenatal care visits also did not attend their postnatal or well-
child visits (York, Tulman, & Brown, 2000). Skipping these
important health visits could contribute to decreased health
screening for both the mother and child.
Midwifery-Led Care
Less than half of all reviewed studies discussing antenatal
care for Black women specifically addressed midwifery-led
care among Black women; only one of these seven mentioned
Black midwives. The single study by Guerra-Reyes and
Hamilton from Indiana University Bloomington was of inter-
est; it presented how Black midwives and doulas articulate or
present their role to the broader community. They noted the
nearly complete lack of topic-related peer reviewed literature
and utilized the web to locate sites run by self-identified mid-
wives and doulas. The researchers gathered qualitative data
from the sites by looking at the demographics, stories, and
narratives written by the Black midwives or doulas. One third
of the noted sites were devoted to advocacy and activism; the
remaining two thirds offered services and advocacy. Main
thematic areas were (a) a strong link to tradition, (b) providers
identifying with more than one role (i.e., activist and doula),
and (c) a sense of urgency in linking their practice to the
future. This study had several limitations, including the
potential for outdated information, inability to interact with
the website owners, exclusion of providers who do not have
websites, or whose websites are not picked up by the search
engines, and nondistinction between midwives and doulas.
However, it shed some light on the perceptions of Black mid-
wives and doulas today (Guerra-Reyes & Hamilton, 2016).
The predominant theme that ran through many of the
remaining studies was CenteringPregnancy, a prenatal care
model started by a midwife that provides group care to
women who are near the same due date (Centering Healthcare
Institute, n.d.). Program benefits include (a) support from the
group, (b) more time for educating, (c) less waiting time at
the clinic, (d) enhanced relationships with their providers,
and (e) improved rates of healthy practices (Klima, Norr,
Vonderheid, & Handler, 2009; Trotman et al., 2015). This
model was introduced in several clinics serving predomi-
nantly Black populations. Despite concerns regarding less-
ened individual time with each mother, which might limit the
midwife's ability to address deeper issues with the women,
the results were overwhelmingly positive (Benatar, Garrett,
Howell, & Palmer, 2013; Earnshaw et al., 2015; Klima et al.,
2009; Palmer, Cook, & Courtot, 2010; Trotman et al., 2015).
Two studies focused on the effect of CenteringPregnancy
care with adolescent to young women, primarily Black
(Earnshaw et al., 2015; Trotman et al., 2015). Both studies
Yoder and Hardy 5
were performed in urban hospitals that served low-income
women. The women who experienced CenteringPregnancy
care attended more prenatal visits and were more involved in
their care than those who used a standard model of prenatal
care (Earnshaw et al., 2015; Trotman et al., 2015). Earnshaw
et al. (2015) purposely crafted groups composed of a range
of ages, and one of the most interesting results of her study is
that women tended to be more engaged in groups that were
more diverse in age. Some additional benefits that
CenteringPregnancy had among Trotman et al.'s (2015) ado-
lescent population was an increase in breastfeeding, adequate
weight gain, and use of birth control methods as compared
with teens who used a traditional prenatal care model.
Four studies specifically compared the differences
between midwife-led prenatal care and physician-led prena-
tal care. One focus identified in these studies was the number
of health topics reviewed during prenatal care sessions that
were not directly related to clinical care, such as nutrition,
breastfeeding, and family planning, and provider type.
Women participating in midwifery-led care reported discuss-
ing a higher number of health topics than those who received
physician-led care (Palmer et al., 2010; Vonderheid, Norr, &
Handler, 2007). The comparison of health behavior out-
comes related to provider type was closely related. One study
failed to find an association between provider type and health
behaviors; however, patients who used CNMs did report
more encouragement to engage in healthy behavior than
patients who were cared for by MDs (Vonderheid et al.,
2007). These results contradicted the study on adolescent
health behaviors that saw an increase in positive health
behaviors such as increased breastfeeding rates and adequate
weight gain in the group of primarily Black adolescents
receiving midwifery care (Trotman et al., 2015). However,
this difference might be partially attributed to the difference
in midwifery care models where Vonderheid et al. used a
more traditional midwifery one-on-one care model and
Trotman et al. utilized the CenteringPregnancy model.
Two additional variables compared in studies that investi-
gated midwife versus physician-led antenatal care were (a)
the variance in C-section and PTB rate based on provider type
and (b) the length of time spent with provider during prenatal
visits. Women receiving prenatal care at a birthing center
staffed by midwives were less likely to have a C-section
(Benatar et al., 2013; Palmer et al., 2010) and less likely to
deliver preterm than those who received standard prenatal
care at a hospital or clinic. A significant difference was noted
in the average amount of patient/provider time spent in prena-
tal care sessions. Centers utilizing CenteringPregnancy model
hold, on average, 2-hr prenatal sessions with each group
(Centering Healthcare Institute, n.d.). However, even among
providers who do not utilize CenteringPregnancy, a study in
Washington, D.C., comparing average prenatal visit times
between obstetricians at a clinic and CNMs at a birthing cen-
ter found that the length of time spent with the provider was
often twice as long at the birthing center than at the clinics.
First time visits at the birthing center could last nearly 2 hr,
whereas first time visits at the clinics ranged from 25 to 35
min. Follow-up visits at the birthing center ranged from 20 to
90 min, depending on the need, whereas follow-up visits at
the clinics usually were 20 to 30 min (Palmer et al., 2010).
Few of the studies focused on Black women's perception of
midwives; however, some address it in passing (Klima et al.,
2009; Palmer et al., 2010; Tucker Edmonds et al., 2015).
Participants from a predominantly Black community who were
involved in a study that evaluated the introduction of
CenteringPregnancy in a public health clinic were asked what
they thought of the care. The women expressed that being
heard and making friends in the group were positive aspects of
CenteringPregnancy. Overall, there was an increased satisfac-
tion in prenatal care with this particular midwifery model
(Klima et al., 2009). Another woman voiced appreciation for
the personal interest and care that a CNM in a birthing center
showed her by personally calling to check up on her (Palmer
et al., 2010).Astudy that did specifically examine Black wom-
en's preferences in provider care found that women described
feeling more in control and empowered when they used a mid-
wife for prenatal care (Tucker Edmonds et al., 2015).
Discussion
This review notes that there are three principal areas of expe-
rience that the literature covers regarding Black women's
antenatal care. These are (a) care disparities, (b) perceptions
of antenatal care, and (c) midwifery-led care.
Examining the care disparities that have an impact on
Black women's antenatal care shows that there are many fac-
tors beyond their control, such as discrimination and access
to care. Discrimination is a particularly pervasive factor, as it
is shown to be an issue both within the health care system
and on a day-to-day basis. The stress of daily discrimination
adds to the number of stressful life situations that Black
women are already at a higher risk of facing, such as access
to care and transportation issues. Stress is strongly correlated
with higher rates of alcohol and drug use, and the studies
reviewed noted an increase in negative birth outcome for
both substance use and stressful life events. This historical
connection is not difficult to see in the case of discrimina-
tion, particularly on a health care level. It was not until the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 that federally funded hospitals were
not allowed to deny care based on race, ethnicity, or income
level, and even then, segregation remained an issue
(Friedman, 2014). During the mid-1900s while Black mid-
wives were being phased out, there was significant stigma
attached to being or receiving care from an "uneducated"
midwife, and it is very likely that there were some Black
women who felt ashamed of the stigma involved with using
a midwife, and yet were excluded from care at hospitals. This
frustration associated with a lack of options may still color
the Black woman's perception of midwifery use today; how-
ever, there is no research that addresses this question.
6 SAGE Open
The limited information offered in these studies about
Black women's perceptions of antenatal care shows two pre-
dominant themes of frustration, and desire for personalized,
respectful care. A frustration component, according to the
Close et al. (2013) study, is that women do not always see
positive birth effects even when they do attend prenatal care
regularly. Participants cited discrimination and disrespectful
encounters as deterrents to care. Unplanned pregnancies
were also a source of stress that could negatively affect Black
women's perception of obtaining prenatal care. Some of
these frustrations could be addressed through meeting the
prenatal care desires mentioned by participants, particularly
personalized care, continuity of provider, respect, and to be
listened to. These are desires of most women when it comes
to health care; however, considering the history of discrimi-
natory health treatment that Black women faced in the not-
so-distant past, it is sobering to realize that these basic needs
for respect often remain unmet. Overall, Black women's per-
ception of a desirable prenatal care experience coincides well
with midwifery-led care, which tends to be more personal-
ized and holistic. However, the percentage of Black women
who use midwives is only 12% of the total number of CNM/
CM-attended live births in the United States (HealthData.
gov, 2014).
The studies addressing Black women's experience of
antenatal care in relation to midwifery-led care focused
predominantly on CenteringPregnancy, a midwifery model
that uses a group approach to care. Participants had mostly
positive responses to this model, particularly the group
aspect. The sessions were longer, on average, than tradi-
tional prenatal appointments, and there was more time for
the midwife to engage in patient teaching. Women specifi-
cally mentioned feeling more in control and empowered in
prenatal sessions with midwives. It appears that midwifery
could be a good method of care to offer Black women;
however, there is not enough research on Black women's
perception of the desirability of this option. The studies
included in the review focused primarily on positive health
outcomes because of implementing CenteringPregnancy or
midwifery-led care.
A single study addressed the practice of Black midwives
today. This study by Guerra-Reyes and Hamilton (2016),
provided valuable information despite many limitations.
Black midwives and doulas were noted to be focused on
advocacy. All of the Black midwives and doula websites that
the researchers found and analyzed included an advocacy-
related arm--some focused solely on educating the public
and lobbying for Black midwives, whereas others offered
doula or midwifery services as well. It was also noteworthy
that most of these midwives and doulas based inspiration for
their practice on the history of the Black midwives. The limi-
tations of this study suggest that some information was out-
dated. There was also an inability to interact with the website
owners and a potential exclusion of providers who did not
have websites, or whose websites were not picked up by the
search engines. These limitations indicate an urgent need for
more research exploring the role of Black midwives today.
Major gaps in the literature noted in this review are (a)
Black women's perception of midwifery as an antenatal care
option and (b) experience and practice of Black midwives
today. A further geographical gap is a lack of studies looking
at how Black women in the south view midwives and their
role in prenatal care. Most of the CenteringPregnancy studies
took place in the North.
Conclusion
Epidemiological data clearly indicate the high propensity for
adverse events associated with pregnancy in Black women.
The effect of stress, discrimination, and limited access to
care suggest implications of late or no prenatal care. There is
a paucity of literature surrounding Black women's experi-
ence of antenatal care. In the past 10 years, 18 studies were
found pertaining to this topic, and two were not included in
the analysis because they were secondary analyses of late
1990s data. Seven of the remaining 16 articles addressed
midwifery care directly, and one of the seven investigated the
role of Black midwives. Considering the long history of mid-
wifery among Black women well into the 1960s, this gap in
the literature is significant.
Further research is essential to address the gaps related to
the antenatal needs of Black women and the perception that
Black women hold concerning midwifery as an option for
antenatal care, particularly in the south. Examining the liter-
ature, it appears that midwifery has the potential to address
the lower prenatal care rates that Black women experience,
as an option that is favorably considered, has good outcomes,
and may better accommodate Black women's desires for pre-
natal care--attentive provider, continuity of care, and woman
empowering. However, there has been no research investi-
gating Black women's perceptions and desires surrounding
changes to the antenatal care available to them, or the role
that midwives might play; this is where the literature falls
short. The gap, as noted, is significant. Researchers must
meet, consult with, and listen to Black women and hear their
stories to understand the significance of midwifery to them.
Only then, in partnership with, and based on suggestions for
change from Black women themselves, can health care pro-
viders and researchers begin to make changes in the health
care system to facilitate improved antenatal care for Black
women and their neonates.
