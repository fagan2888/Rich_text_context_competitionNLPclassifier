Unexplained Health Problems after Gulf War Service Steele
Invited Commentary: Unexplained Health Problems after Gulf War Service--
Finding Answers to Complex Questions
Lea Steele
Numerous studies have investigated the health problems reported by veterans of the Persian Gulf War, but
important questions remain. Epidemiologic studies have consistently indicated that Gulf War veterans report
unexplained symptoms at significantly higher rates than veteran comparison groups but that they have not
experienced excess rates of disease-related mortality. Addressing unanswered questions surrounding post-Gulf-
War health problems presents a complex challenge for researchers, but not an insurmountable one. Progress in
understanding the role of potential etiologic factors can be made using epidemiologic approaches traditionally
applied in the absence of individual exposure data, such as comparisons between veteran subgroups with
differing illness profiles and deployment histories. Am J Epidemiol 2001;154:406­9.

In the decade since the Persian Gulf War, the health prob-
lems reported by returning veterans have been a source of
contention and controversy (1­4). Much of the controversy
has related to questions about the nature and causes of these
ailments. Early discussion focused on whether the condi-
tions were organic or psychological, a result of stress or of
toxic exposures (5­7). More recently, debate has shifted to
the existence of a unique "Gulf War syndrome" (8, 9) and
whether these unexplained symptoms should be considered
primarily part of a general phenomenon that occurs after
every war or a consequence of events and exposures unique
to the Gulf War (8, 10, 11).
Epidemiologic investigations have made progress in iden-
tifying some of the "harder" post-Gulf-War health out-
comes--that is, outcomes that can be objectively assessed
and quantified, such as mortality and hospitalization rates.
Less progress has been made in characterizing the "softer"
endpoints--the many symptoms reported by Gulf War vet-
erans that are often unaccompanied by observable signs or
laboratory abnormalities.
What do we know about the health of Gulf War
veterans?
The article by Kang and Bullman (12) in this issue of the
Journal compares mortality rates between Gulf War veter-
ans and Gulf-War-era veterans who did not serve in the war.
After 7 years of follow-up, no association was found
between disease-related deaths and either Gulf War service
overall or proximity to the Khamisiyah weapons demolition
site in Iraq. Another key finding is that Gulf War veterans
have not experienced excess rates of death due to cancer or
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although this cohort will have
to be followed for many more years to monitor mortality
due to conditions that develop over longer latency periods.
Higher rates of mortality from accidents but not from dis-
ease have been reported among Gulf War veterans in the
United Kingdom (13). In addition, studies have identified
few differences in hospitalization rates between Gulf War
veterans and non-Gulf veterans in the years since the war
(14­16).
A different picture of veterans' post-Gulf-War health sta-
tus is provided by another body of epidemiologic research.
Population-based studies have consistently shown that Gulf
veterans have an unexpectedly high level of morbidity, as
characterized by self-reported symptomatology and diag-
nosed medical and psychiatric conditions (17­26). Overall,
the types of symptoms reported by different veteran groups
are strikingly similar, even though veterans in these studies
came from different countries and served in different areas of
the Persian Gulf theater. Gulf War veterans, as a group, are
significantly more symptomatic than nondeployed Gulf-
War-era veterans (17, 19­26), Gulf-War-era veterans
deployed to other areas of the world (18), and veterans who
served in the war in Bosnia (22). Among Gulf War veterans,
the prevalences of symptoms and multisymptom complexes
are frequently associated with specific self-reported wartime
exposures (19, 22, 27­32). Symptomatic Gulf veterans typi-
cally have few abnormalities on routine clinical examinations
and laboratory tests (21, 33), although preliminary studies
have identified group differences in neurologic and immune
parameters (34­40). Additionally, Gulf veterans score lower
than comparison groups on standardized tests assessing
physical and psychological function (19, 21, 22, 41).

Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 5, 2001
Studies have also indicated that, while some Gulf veter-
ans are affected by psychiatric conditions, including post-
traumatic stress disorder, the increased morbidity observed
among Gulf War veterans cannot be adequately accounted
for by deployment stress and psychiatric illness (28, 42, 43).
This is not surprising, given the brief and decisive nature of
the Gulf War. Over 70 percent of veterans deployed to the
region were not involved in combat and did not witness any
deaths (24).
To summarize, with respect to post-Gulf-War health prob-
lems, two facts have been consistently demonstrated: 1) Gulf
War veterans, as a group, have not been unduly affected by
adverse health outcomes associated with "hard" measures,
such as rates of hospitalization and disease-related mortality;
and 2) Gulf War veterans, as a group, have consistently been
shown to be more symptomatic and debilitated than non-
Gulf-War veterans. The obvious conclusion to draw from
these two facts is that, whatever the nature of the health prob-
lems affecting Gulf War veterans, they do not currently
appear to be of the type that generally results in hospitaliza-
tion or premature death.
Beyond these main points, not much more is actually
known about post-Gulf-War health problems. Most other
essential information regarding these problems remains
unknown or unverified. At the population level, basic epi-
demiologic parameters, including prevalence, population
distribution, and etiologic and risk factors have yet to be
clearly elucidated. Clinically, pathophysiologic mechanisms
and diagnostic markers have not been identified, nor have
efficacious medical therapies been demonstrated, although
two clinical trials are currently under way. Why has so little
progress been made, despite numerous studies and a federal
research investment that now exceeds $155 million (44)?
There are several reasons, some obvious, others less so.
Complex illnesses are difficult to study
The most obvious reason for the lack of progress in iden-
tifying the basic epidemiologic parameters of post-Gulf-War
health problems is the challenge inherent in investigating ill-
ness that is identified almost solely on the basis of subjec-
tive symptoms. Moreover, many believe that "Gulf War ill-
ness" would more accurately be termed "Gulf War illnesses"
(45), since symptom profiles vary from person to person.
Add to that the appearance that these problems are multi-
factorial in origin--that is, that they may have been precip-
itated by several factors, either alone or in different combi-
nations--and the situation is enough to give an
epidemiologist pause.
The less obvious impediments to progress may include
blind alleys generated in attempts to make sense out of this
complex illness phenomenon. As with any new area of med-
ical inquiry, useful answers can emerge only when we are
able to ask the right questions.
Is there a Gulf War syndrome?
"Is there a unique Gulf War syndrome?" has been identi-
fied as the central health question following Operation Desert
Storm (46) and has been the subject of a number of research
articles and commentaries (4, 8, 11, 33, 40, 47­49). While
this question is worth answering, it is not the fundamental
question at issue. Addressing it as the primary question, in
effect, puts the cart before the horse. The more essential
question can be phrased "Are veterans of the Gulf War
affected by chronic health problems associated with their
service in the war?" If that question can be clearly answered
and if, as population studies have suggested, the answer
appears to be yes, the most immediate follow-up questions
would relate to the symptomatic, physiologic, and psycho-
logical characteristics of these health problems and to
factors associated with their etiology. Only after these ques-
tions have been addressed can we begin to determine
whether we are looking at one syndrome or more and
whether these syndromes are distinct from previously iden-
tified conditions.
Recent observations on whether post-Gulf-War health
problems constitute a unique syndrome have relied on the
results of exploratory factor analyses. In these analyses,
general lists of symptoms reported by large, heterogeneous
groups of Gulf War veterans have been found to load onto
factors similar to those found in non-Gulf veterans (47­49).
The question remains, however, as to whether factor analy-
sis is a suitable tool for determining the presence or absence
of a unique syndrome in a given population.
It would be appealing to simply subject all the symptoms
reported by a population to a relatively straightforward
analysis that would allow any "new" syndromes to reveal
themselves as constructs. Unfortunately, this is not what one
would expect from an exploratory factor analysis of symp-
toms. The explanation as to why this is so requires an under-
standing of what factor analysis is and what the factors in a
given analysis actually represent. An excellent description
of these considerations was provided by renowned psycho-
metrician Dr. Stanley Mulaik in his presentation at the 1998
Conference on Federally Sponsored Gulf War Veterans'
Illnesses Research (50). Pointing out that "factors are not
syndromes," he cautioned investigators that exploratory fac-
tor analyses are unlikely to reveal novel symptom patterns,
especially when relying exclusively on first-order factors.
Factors expected from such analyses would be those
associated with pathology or distress in particular organs or
systems. Such factors would probably be similar in any het-
erogeneous population, even those including individuals
with different chronic diseases precipitated by different eti-
ologic factors. In other words, comparing the results of
exploratory factor analyses of symptoms endorsed by Gulf
War and non-Gulf-War veterans would not be expected to
identify a unique "Gulf War syndrome," regardless of
whether veterans are affected by excess morbidity or dis-
tinct pathologies as a result of their Gulf War service.
Can these questions be answered?
Suggestions for epidemiologic research
Because wartime exposure data are not available for indi-
vidual veterans, there have been suggestions that we might
never know what caused these problems or, by extension,
408 Steele

their physiologic mechanisms (6, 51). However, epidemio-
logic methods are particularly well-suited to providing clues
that generate specific hypotheses about disease etiology,
even when individual exposure data cannot be obtained. It is
therefore surprising that epidemiologic methods tradition-
ally used to investigate unknown diseases potentially caused
by environmental factors have scarcely been applied to the
Gulf War illness question. Epidemiologists generally begin
investigations of unknown diseases by first generating a
description of the illness and then delineating its distribution
in a given population according to characteristics of person,
place, and time. This classic approach has proven useful in
a study of Kansas Gulf War veterans, where a defined symp-
tom pattern was found to be strongly associated with the
places and time periods in which veterans had served in the
Persian Gulf theater (25).
Progress in understanding whether environmental expo-
sures might have contributed to veterans' illnesses can be
made by conducting epidemiologic studies that compare
symptom profiles of well-defined veteran subgroups (52,
53). Veterans may be grouped in any number of ways (e.g.,
by unit or location). If, for example, veterans in Unit A
have a high rate of a defined symptom complex but veter-
ans in Unit B have a low rate, differences in deployment
experiences and circumstances between the two groups
should provide important insights about possible etiologic
factors.
Associations between illness and location in the Persian
Gulf theater have been described in unpublished studies
conducted by researchers from the Department of
Veterans Affairs (54), in a Congressional report on in-
theater locations of veterans filing disability claims (55),
and by Navy investigators (56). In a study of 2,715
Marine Gulf veterans conducted in March 1991, Navy
investigators defined three exposure groups according to
unit locations in the preceding months. The study found
that the group of veterans who had been closest to oil well
fires for the longest period of time had significantly more
respiratory symptoms (wheezing, cough, runny nose, sore
throat) and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, stomach
cramps, nausea, vomiting) than did veterans stationed in
other locations (56). This early study shows that differ-
ences in the frequencies and patterns of symptoms by time
and place can be and have been identified and can provide
useful information, even when individual exposure data
are unavailable.
Another urgent requirement for progress in both epidemi-
ologic and clinical investigations is a consensus definition
of what constitutes a Gulf War illness "case." Arriving at
such a definition may be a difficult challenge in a commu-
nity of researchers divided about whether a Gulf War illness
problem even exists; yet we know that Gulf War veterans, as
a group, endorse symptoms in several categories at higher
frequencies than do individuals in comparison populations.
This excess morbidity can be described and quantified (57).
Without a standardized case definition, investigators will
continue to identify different groups of symptomatic veter-
ans as "cases," which will result in findings that are difficult
to interpret and impossible to compare.
Conclusions
Answering fundamental questions about the health prob-
lems reported in the wake of Gulf War service poses a com-
plex challenge for researchers, but not an insurmountable
one. At this stage of our understanding, one of the plausible
explanations for the Gulf War illness mystery is that, as one
Gulf veteran put it, "Something happened to us out there in
the desert" (58). Whatever that something might have been,
it is too early to pronounce these questions unanswerable.
This is especially so when epidemiologic approaches that
have the potential to provide basic etiologic information
have yet to be fully utilized.
