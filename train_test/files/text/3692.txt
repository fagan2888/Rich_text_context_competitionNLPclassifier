Introduction
The Earth's climate is already changing, and the changes
are particularly marked in the Arctic. The Arctic is
undergoing significant transformation as a result of cli-
mate change and increased human use including marine
transportation, tourism and resource development. The
highly uncertain sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the
Arctic to the projected climate change is a major issue of
global concern. Studies during the 1990s suggest that the
Arctic has been a sink for atmospheric CO2
. The impacts
of climate change in the Arctic will be felt throughout
the world because changes in physical processes here
influence the climate on a global scale. Processes of
change in the Arctic can therefore provide a unique
insight into the climate change that is already taking
place and also act as a forewarning of the future regional
and global impacts of these changes.
Challenges in continuous data
collection
In the Arctic, continuous ocean observations are quite
sparse, except for the surface where satellite data
collection is possible. It is thus a challenging environment
to monitor. The region is not well covered by satellites, and
heavy cloud cover often limits their use. Buoy and float
systems are a highly promising way to take measurements
in the depths of the ocean. Here, the major challenge is to
build up expertise and capacity to develop new observing
systems suitable for the Arctic environmental conditions.
Amajor knowledge gap in this region is due to the lack of
long-term, multidisciplinary inter-annual data spanning both
the summer and ice-covered winter seasons. In particular, the
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and/or Arctic oscillation
(AO) are the major components of inter-annual variability in
the NorthAtlantic andArctic area. Recent studies as reported
by Song Feng and Qi Hu (2008) and B.N. Goswami et al.

Abstract
This article describes the first Indian arctic multi-sensor mooring (IndARC) observatory in Kongsfjorden of Arctic
waters. The Ministry of Earth Sciences evolved a unique moored observatory `IndARC' with suite of sensors for
physico-chemical and oceanographic in situ long-term data collection. The Arctic Ocean plays an important role in
governing the earth's climate and also faithfully records its past climatic history and represents a significant gap in
ocean observations. This indigenously designed and installed observatory IndARC, for the first time, collected various
parameters from July 2014 to July 2015. The uniqueness of this system, the challenges faced and results from data
collected are presented in this article.

Original Article
56 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(2)
(2006) have shown that there is a physical linking of the multi-
decadal and inter-annual variabilities in the Indian summer
monsoon rainfall with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
as well as the NAO. This need to continuously monitor
ocean parameters for extended periods was a driving force
for the development of moorings in the arctic region. Hence
it was decided to deploy a multi-sensor mooring within the
Kongsfjorden, along with complementary ongoing field sur-
veys. India has now established its first multi-sensor moored
observatory in the Kongsfjorden. The IndARC deployment
can be certainly considered as a significant achievement and
a testimony to the capabilities of the Earth System Science
Organization (ESSO) in designing, developing and installing
underwater observatories. The data acquired will be of vital
importance to the Indian climate researchers as well as to the
international fraternity.
India's first mooring in Arctic
A major milestone in India's scientific endeavours in the
Arctic region has been achieved on 23 July 2014 when
a team of scientists from ESSO­National Institute of
Ocean Technology (NIOT) and ESSO­National Centre for
Antarctic and Ocean Research (NCAOR) successfully
deployed the IndARC system, the country's first multi-
sensor moored observatory in the Kongsfjorden fjord of
the Arctic, roughly half way between Norway and the
North Pole (Figure 1). The fjord lays adjacent to both
Arctic and Atlantic water masses. It is an open fjord, with-
out sill, and therefore is largely influenced by the processes
on the adjacent shelf. With five tidewater glaciers,
Kongsfjorden acts as a natural laboratory to study the cli-
matic impacts of global warming, the localArctic warming
as explained by Yongqi Gao et al.(2009), the consequent
glacial melt and the impacts of freshwater discharge. This
is also an established reference site for Arctic marine stud-
ies as it receives variable Arctic/Atlantic climatic signals
between years with measurable effects on the physical and
biological systems. With established research facilities
available, there is a great potential for international, multi-
disciplinary collaborations.
Design of IndARC
The moored observatory included measurements of cur-
rent speed and direction, salinity, temperature and

dissolved oxygen. Data were measured for a year from
July 2014. A key challenge was the presence of ice cover,
sea ice, floating ice and drifting icebergs with >20m
draft, which challenged conventional methods of measur-
ing near the surface. This was overcome using a weak link
at 25
m separating a surface part of the mooring with a
deeper part. If heavy loads are experienced on the moor-
ing due to icebergs, the link will give away and the main
mooring will remain safe. Floats fixed above the weak
link section will surface the upper delinked portion and a
beacon at the top float will emit signal to identify the
floating location. This can be monitored from shore and
the sensors and data can be retrieved.
Salinity, temperature and oxygen were measured using
multiple SEABIRD-SBE37-SMP-ODO with internal bat-
teries, memory and integral pump. Currents were meas-
ured using a single-point Nortek current meter and an
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Both meas-
ured three-component (East, North, Up) velocity using
Acoustic Doppler technology. All plastic and titanium
parts eliminated corrosion.1 The ADCP is a hydro-acous-
tic current meter similar to sonar, measuring water current
velocities over a 170-m depth range using the Doppler
effect of sound waves scattered back from particles within
the water column. The unit has no moving parts that can
be blocked or damaged.
Technology is the fundamental requirement to make
ocean observations, and a reliable platform is an absolute
need to undertake long-term in situ observations. The
mooring is designed with a buoyancy of 617kg compris-
ing of steel float of 317
kg and glass floats of 300
kg
buoyancy, using OrcaFlex software. The Argos beacon
attached to IndARC offers selectable preset frequency
channels, along with a range of duty cycle options, result-
ing in a range of broadcast specifications. Powered with
lithium batteries, this miniature recovery aid is designed
for long-term ocean deployments. The Mini Beacon
housing includes an integrated conductivity sensor that
isolates the unit's power while submerged and activates
the device upon surfacing. The Acoustic Release unit has
been selected to suit arctic conditions with the capability
to withstand the load experienced on the mooring. Two
IXSEA Acoustic releases were connected in tandem to
serve as a redundant recovery node in mooring.
Testing of IndARC subcomponents
In order to ascertain the performance of the sensors and
subcomponents, testing of all of the sensors and other
accessories at low temperature was carried out using the
environmental chamber facility at ESSO-NIOT. The
environmental chamber can test components in the tem-
perature range of -45°C to +180°C and a humidity range
of 10%­98% relative humidity (RH). Online measure-
ments of the components were executed simultaneously
during low temperature condition. The O-rings were also
subjected to very low temperature of -20°C and tested.
The float with a mechanical fixture for holding the
Satellite telemetry beacon was fabricated in-house and
tested for stability and upright verticality of the Beacon
at Acoustic Test Facility Tank at ESSO-NIOT. The instru-
ments selected for IndARC have been programmed to
work continuously for 1
year to collect real-time data.
The power source requirements have been specially
selected so that data collection is continuous without
interruption. The sampling depth is duly selected and the
mooring design has been accordingly configured for
point and profile sampling.
Deployment of IndARC
The IndARC-I moored observatory was deployed and
recovered from the Norwegian Polar Institute's research
vessel R.V. Lance at 78°57N/12°01E (Figures 2 and 3),
about 1100km away from the North Pole at a water depth

of 192
m. It has an array of 10 state-of-the-art oceano-
graphic sensors strategically positioned at discrete depths
in the water column (Figures 4). Seawater temperature and
salinity data were collected from discrete depths at 22, 30,
55, 80, 105 and 140m from July 2014 to July 2015. The
moored observatory was successfully retrieved on 15 July
2015. The data from all the sensors were downloaded suc-
cessfully. Subsequently, the IndARC II mooring with addi-
tional sensors to measure photosynthetically active
radiation (PAR), nitrate and ambient noise was deployed
on 19 July 2015.
Analysis of collected data
The temperature at all depths showed an annual cycle with
maximum temperature of 7°C recorded during August and
minimum of -1.5°C during February (Figure 5).This phe-
nomenon was also reported by O.M. Johannessen et al.
(2004). The salinity varied from 33.6 to 35.1PSU as shown
by Suzanne E. MacLachlan et al. (2007) at all depths, with
drastic changes observed during August­September 2014
where the salinity dropped by almost 2.7
PSU (Figure 6).
Another lowest salinity was observed during November at
55, 80, 105 and 140m. The dissolved oxygen at 22m depth
recorded minimum value of 6.6
mL/L during September
and peaked during the month of May with a reading of
9.5mL/L (Figure 7). During May, the oxygen content in the
water increased drastically from 7.7 to 9.5mL/L. The pri-
mary findings reveal that the fjord waters are well mixed
during December to April. A strong north-westward current
during May, suddenly increased the oxygen content of the

region; thereafter, the waters became stratified. This effect
is attributed to the freshwater released by melting ice,
which confines phytoplankton to the upper sunlit layer,
resulting in a biological bloom as reported by Kevin R
Arrigo et al. (2012). The zonal, meridional and vertical cur-
rent obtained from the ADCP showed strong westward cur-
rents during September and May as shown by the top panel
in Figure 8.This is also reported by F.R. Cottier et al.
(2005). The strong westward currents during May also
coincided with strong northward and positive entrainment
as represented by the middle and bottom panels. Similar
strong currents were observed in the fjord during September
and May by another mooring deployed by The Scottish
Association of Marine Sciences (SAMS), UK. This strong
current has also driven the drastic increase of oxygen at
22m depth during May 2015. Current speed obtained from
ADCP at 25
m depth was plotted against current speed
obtained from the single point current meter as shown in
Figure 9. Both the instruments showed a peak in current
speed of 180
mm/s during May. During the last week of
September 2014, passage of strong current was recorded by
tilt and heading sensors of ADCP too. There was a sudden
dip in the surface temperature of 2°C during this period as
reported in F. R. Cottier et al. (2007). The preliminary
observation shows that the fjord water column is stratified
during summer and it is well mixed during winter. The
observations also show strong diurnal and intraseasonal
variabilities, and these features will be reported in the sub-
sequent article with detailed analysis.
India has become a significant contributor to Arctic sci-
entific advancements. The Arctic Ocean plays a major role
in driving the world's ocean circulation, which impacts the
distribution of heat across the globe and the global climate.
Success of this study encourages continuing this observa-
tion on a long-term basis which would enable India to
develop a bio-physical regional model in the Kongsfjorden,
Arctic region for better understanding of the system as
seen in the website. The performance of sensors under
immersed condition is affected by marine fouling organ-
isms. Figure 10 shows one of the most abundant branched

bryozoans Eucratea loricata in Kongsfjorden on these
underwater sensors. This growth is seen on the sensors
which were mounted near to the seabed and abrasion of
solid particles from Glaciers would have prevented their
larval settlement.
Closure
New suite of sensors was added during deployment of
IndARC II mooring in the fjord. Data retrieval mechanism
for downloading the data at routine intervals during sum-
mer is being planned for the upcoming deployments.
