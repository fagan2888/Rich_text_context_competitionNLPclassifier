Actual decision making for retirement is largely inaccessible to investigation, yet research can focus on plans as a
window into the preretirement process. This article proposes a construct that profiles five generic types of retirement
plans, including plans to retire completely, retire partially, change jobs, never retire, and uncertainty about
retirement. The heuristic value of the construct lies in its recognition of the heterogeneity of retirement intentions. The
five plan types were operationalized among workers aged 51--61 in the 1992 Health and Retirement Study. Convergent
validity was demonstrated by comparison to analogous survey questions. Construct validity was shown by predictable
relationships between intentions and elements of workers' opportunity structure. The retirement-plans construct can
serve as the foundation for a taxonomy of specific retirement plans (e.g., about timing, employment), to organize
research on stability and change in retirement intentions, and characterize the path dependence of eventual retirement
behavior.
HOW people come to retire as they do is an enduring topic
of interest. We outline an extended conception of
retirement decision making that identifies workers' plans for
retirement as provisional intentions creating paths toward
later behavior. In order to provide a conceptual tool for
research about plans, we propose here a scheme to character-
ize workers' general stance toward retirement. We examine
the validity of our multinomial construct for measuring
plans, and discuss its usefulness for research on the retire-
ment process.
Although a great deal of research has been organized
around the "retirement decision," these investigations have
usually studied the outcomes, rather than the actual making,
of decisions. These outcomes -- retired or not, early or late,
partially or completely -- surely do proceed from personal
decisions in the context of opportunity. Yet, outcome studies
leave processes of decision making largely unobserved (ex-
ceptions being specific studies of temporary incentive pro-
grams, e.g., Hardy and Quadagno, 1995). Moreover, the
identification of outcomes with presumed decisions suggests
that decision making for retirement is an end-game election
of practicable alternatives.
Consider, rather, the idea that decision making for retire-
ment extends over a considerable period of time -- years --
prior to the retirement event, and so the retirement behav-
iors (that are the focus of so much research) have anteced-
ents in earlier decisions made and remade that will have
channelled workers toward particular outcomes. At this
juncture, two questions present themselves: How does re-
search access the stream of decision making, and, How
might upstream decision making be consequential for even-
tual retirement behavior?
Plans as Provisional, Consequential Decisions
Workers' engagement with the prospect of retirement is
normative. With the institutionalization of retirement in the
modern life course (O'Rand, 1990), few adults can be
unaware that they will encounter the question of retirement.
Exactly when this encounter begins to be personally salient
is hard to say, yet there has been some study of how the
encounter unfolds as a preretirement process of role exit
(Ekerdt and DeViney, 1993; Karp, 1989). From this re-
search, it is reasonable to expect that workers' anticipatory
involvement with retirement is underway during their 50s.
With advancing age, workers progressively engage (or are
brought by others to engage) in questions about their retire-
ment: Will it happen? When? Under what arrangement? To
the extent that workers entertain ideas about what they will
do, or may do, or will not do, we contend that workers are
engaged in provisional decision making for retirement, and
that these ideas are their plans. Plans, more formally, are
behavioral intentions about retirement. Workers' decision-
making occasions are not readily accessible to research, but
behavioral intentions are, and there is a considerable tradi-
tion of research on intentions (as disclosed by survey tech-
niques) as the precursors of behavior (Azjen and Fishbein,
1980). Plans, then, are the practical window into decision
making for retirement at any remove from the event. In the
array of such intentions (or lack thereof), decision making
for retirement becomes quite available for study.
Given the norm of retirement in the modern life course,
why do workers entertain plans for this or that sort of
retirement, or no plans at all? We posit that workers antici-
pate their late career and retirement alternatives from within
an "opportunity structure" composed of biographical and
situational factors that make action conceivable in the pur-
suit of valued goals (Baron and Hannan, 1994; Blau, 1994;
Merton, 1968). Workers have choices, options, and alterna-
tives, but only as opportunity allows. Workers who intend to
act in ways for which they have small opportunity (e.g.,
retire at 55) will have unstable plans.
An outline of the opportunity structure includes many of
the same factors that have been used to predict the retirement
behavior that is temporally downstream from plans (Feld-
S140
RETIREMENT PLANS S141
man, 1994; Gustman, Mitchell, and Steinmeier, 1993;
Quinn, Burkhauser, and Myers, 1990). The opportunity
structure of a 50- or 55-year-old worker facing retirement
would theoretically consist of such elements as: ascribed
statuses (age, gender, race), the occupational situation, cur-
rent income and wealth, pension and other income prospects,
marital and family roles, health, community ties, and prior
experience with retirement. These are rarely independent
elements; for example, issues of gender and work cannot be
completely separated.
While plans anticipate later transitions, these intentions
are also of interest and of consequence for the interim
behaviors they may prompt along the way. Such preparation
steps are instrumental acts that workers undertake in pursuit
of a goal-directed activity such as retirement (Bagozzi and
Warshaw, 1992). The acts that flow from intentions may
include steps such as a savings program, acquisition of
information, the resolve to work toward pension eligibility
on the current job, positioning oneself for a post-retirement
job, the purchase of retirement property, or announcing
intentions to family and coworkers. Cumulatively, these
steps and signals would create a course toward particular
outcomes and away from others. There may be, to borrow a
phrase from elsewhere in social science (Arthur, 1989), a
"path dependence" to retirement decision making wherein
early choices constrain later options.
Plans, we allow, may change over time. Aside from
studies of the expected timing for retirement (Anderson,
Burkhauser, and Quinn, 1986; Bernheim, 1988; Ekerdt,
Vinick, and Bosse, 1989; Nestel, 1985), little is known
about the dynamics of behavioral intentions toward retire-
ment. To what plans do workers hold fast over time? What
factors contribute to unwavering plans? Do plans change
dependably from one type to another? If the opportunity
structure, composed of such biographical and situational
factors as sketched above, is the platform for timing at any
one point in time, then change in these elements should
herald a change in plans. Such turns as job loss, position
changes, health events, divorce or widowhood, advancing
age, additional tenure, a changing labor market, and other
alterations of opportunity should prompt workers to reexam-
ine their plans in ways that are theoretically predictable.
Moreover, plans not buttressed by instrumental preparation
steps should be especially vulnerable to revision when op-
portunity shifts.
Ultimately, knowledge of the planning history should add
considerable explanatory power to models of retirement
behavior. The deeper and longer the intention to retire in a
particular way, the stronger will be the link between inten-
tion and behavior. When a worker retires completely, or
takes a postretirement job, or forgoes Social Security in
favor of continued employment, such a step is likely to be an
outcome that has been constrained, facilitated, and funneled
down by years of living with the knowledge of retirement as
an occupational eventuality (Ebaugh, 1988). Preparation
steps that flow from intentions are "side bets" (Becker,
1960) made on the way to retirement that commit workers to
paths they cannot readily reverse. The obverse of these
active goal-directed behaviors is preparatory passivity that
later bars workers from adopting paths that they had earlier
forgone. We contend, therefore, that workers' progressive
implication into a course of action for retirement can be
observed through the series of plans that they entertain over
time, thus expanding the temporal scope and explanatory set
for analyses of retirement behavior.
An Economical Profile of Retirement Plans
An extended model of retirement decision making re-
quires a strategy for measuring workers' plans for retire-
ment. Various types of indicators have been used to describe
the anticipation of the retirement event and retired life. The.
focus in this article is on plans, that is, personal designs or
intentions toward the conclusion of the work career and the
initiation of retired life. Designs and intentions for retire-
ment can be characterized along several dimensions. We can
describe plans according to the foreseen eventuality of retire-
ment: workers think they will retire, they won't retire, they
don't know. Plans can be made for the projected timing of
transitions at some age or date, which is also bound to one's
planned manner and mix of pension receipt. Plans can also
be made about sequences of employment, e.g., shifts from
full-time employment to partial retirement or complete re-
tirement, or a shift from wage employment to self-
employment. Plans can be organized around a life style,
e.g., retirement to a certain place, or for a long-awaited
second career.
So intertwined are these dimensions that no single one
adequately captures the complexity of retirement plans as
uniquely personal futures sketched in with more or less
precision and certainty. Single dimensions also focus atten-
tion on holders of specific plans (e.g., retire by age 62), with
those not holding the intentions relegated to a residual status.
We think, however, that it is possible to subsume multiple
dimensions and characterize the heterogeneity of workers'
retirement plans using a limited number of categories.
We propose a multinomial construct that economically
profiles generic types of retirement plans. This construct,
moreover, can serve as the foundation for a taxonomy, or
conceptual arrangement of all sorts of specific plans. Ideally,
this construct should have enough categories to encompass
adequately the variety of workers' outlooks, but not so many
as to be analytically unwieldy. In our view, the categories
should also characterize workers' current ideas about next or
proximate transitions, not their notions about patterns of
possible moves or the final situation. Lastly, the categories
should faithfully reproduce what previous survey research
has disclosed to be workers' typical responses about antici-
pated retirement arrangements (e.g., Louis Harris, 1979;
Nestel, 1985).
The following five-category construct that we propose
anticipates the major types of retirement behavior. Plans for
behavior are thus classified nearly as the behavior could
itself be classified (e.g., Myers, 1991). The first and sim-
plest category comprises workers who plan to retire com-
pletely -- the classic retirement. Full-stop retirement is the
eventual destination for most workers, but it is not necessar-
ily the present plan that they entertain. The second and third
categories describe more complex paths to implied, eventual
retirement (Doeringer, 1990). One is the group who are
S142 EKERDT ET AL.
planning partial retirement or some reduced-effort arrange-
ment. The other group are those who think that they will
obtain another job after the current job, not exactly retiring
but not remaining either.
The last two groups of older workers are usually not
included in analyses of retirement planning, but they have an
authentic stance. One group would be those who explicitly
refuse to entertain the idea of retirement, people who,
whatever else they intend for future employment, reject the
encounter with retirement. Persons who say they will
"never" retire are excepting themselves from the idealized
life course, and they deserve focal status. The final group
would be those with no particular plans, a perfectly reason-
able outlook that recognizes workers' uncertainty about the
future. This group is quite important to recognize because
they may be risking disorderly, ill-considered transitions.
Indeed, without this last type, our construct fails to encom-
pass the heterogeneity of retirement plans and merely de-
scribes labor supply alternatives.
These five general plans for retirement -- complete retire-
ment, partial retirement, serial positions, never retire, and
uncertainty -- should suffice to characterize the stances of
all older workers. Other details of retirement planning, we
would argue, can be analyzed secondary to the general
stance. Thus, timing, further occupational arrangements,
pension scheduling, and other life-style questions can be
viewed as elaborations of the basic intention. This is not to
say that workers first form general plans and then decide
details; rather, we think that plans can be placed first in a
taxonomic and analytic hierarchy.
If our multinomial construct is to serve as a conceptual tool
for research on retirement plans, we need to establish that
such a tool is sound. For our proposed multinomial typology
of retirement plans, this was done in two ways: first, by
examining the convergent validity of the categories, compar-
ing responses with analogous questions, and second, by
examining construct validity, checking the predicted associa-
tion of plans categories with elements of the opportunity
structure. With confidence in the validity of the plans catego-
ries, we can proceed to discuss a more elaborate taxonomy of
plans and further discuss ways by which this scheme might
organize research on the preretirement process.
METHODS
Study Population
The analysis is based on data from the baseline 1992
Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally represent-
ative sample of persons aged 51-61 and their spouses re-
gardless of age (Juster and Suzman, 1995). Total sample size
for the first wave of this biennial longitudinal survey was
12,562 persons in some 7,000 households. The study popu-
lation for the present analysis included all persons aged 51-
61 in the core sample; persons from Black and Hispanic
oversamples were not included. These 8,017 cases were
further reduced by including only current workers who also
claimed they had not completely retired. This study popula-
tion of 5,072 workers aged 51-61 was 47.3 percent female,
11.7 percent non-White, with 83.7 percent of respondents
working 35 or more hours per week.
It is important to remember that, in these cross-sectional
data, the older ranks of this age range will have already
experienced labor force departures due to early retirement.
Of the 8,017 persons aged 51-61 in the core sample, 1,118
claimed to be retired and also not currently working. When
compared to our study population of 5,072 workers, these
already retired persons are older by a mean 1.7 years, are
somewhat more likely to be females (53.4%) and non-
Whites (14.7%), and they have a mean 0.8 fewer years of
education. To the extent that retirement plans are associated
with such characteristics as age or gender -- and they are --
the distribution of plans in a population will follow popula-
tion characteristics. Yet it should be borne in mind that the
dynamic of selective (early) retirement does not bias the
distribution of plans in cross-section because retirement
plans are ideas only available as a practical matter from
workers not yet retired. However, within a workers' cohort
observed over time, the prevalence of plans will shift as
members retire.
Measures
The five retirement-plan types were operationalized from
a survey question that followed a series on current employ-
ment. Workers were asked first about the "usual retirement
age" on their main job, and then, "Are you currently
planning to stop working altogether or work fewer hours at a
particular date or age, to change the kind of work you do
when you reach a particular age, have you not given it much
thought, or what?" Although this question did not explicitly
mention retirement, the preceding question would have set
responses in a retirement context.
Multiple responses (as many as eight) could be recorded
for each respondent, though few gave more than one re-
sponse. We categorized these responses in a hierarchical
fashion, first grouping (1) all persons who said they planned
to "stop work altogether," (2) then all who would "work
fewer hours," (3) then all who would "change the kind of
work" or "work for myself," (4) then all who would
"never stop work," and (5) then all who "had not given lit]
much thought" or "had no current plans." Workers with
"other" responses (/? = 23) were dropped from the analy-
sis. These five categories (Table 1) were labeled Stop Alto-
gether, Reduce Effort, Change Job, Never Stop, and No
Plans. Respondents in the first three categories had also been
asked the age at which they planned to make the change.
These mutually exclusive categories nevertheless con-
tained some individuals who offered more than one re-
sponse. Based on planned ages for the change, workers were
reassigned to the earliest occurring status if they expressed
multiple plans to Stop, Reduce, or Change Jobs. If workers
expressed plans to Stop and also to Reduce or Change Jobs at
the same age, they were re-assigned to the latter statuses. In
all, 0.5 percent of cases were shifted among categories for
expressing serial retirement plans. The final distribution of
the plans categories for 5,049 workers is shown in Table 1.
To test the convergent validity of the plans scheme, three
analogous survey items about retirement expectations (lo-
cated elsewhere in the interview) were involved in this
RETIREMENT PLANS S143
analysis. One pair of items asked respondents to state the
chances on a 0-10 scale that they would be working (at any
job) full-time past age 62 and past age 65. Another item
asked workers, "When do you think you will retire?" or
retire "completely" in the case of partial retirees; responses
in calendar years were converted to expected ages. The final
item asked whether, when they retired, respondents would
want to stop paid work entirely or continue some paid work.
Ten other variables were included for the analysis of
construct validity, testing the predicted consistency of retire-
ment plans with aspects of the opportunity structure in which
older workers are lodged. We can describe these elements
and discuss their predicted association with retirement plans
under three headings: ascribed statuses, work situation, and
individual factors. Descriptive statistics for all measures are
shown in Table 2.
Among ascribed statuses, gender is an important context
for opportunity. A large and growing body of literature
provides a sound basis for gender-based differences in work
histories (DeViney and O'Rand, 1988). Women are less
likely than men to have had long, uninterrupted work careers
at the kinds of occupations that reward workers with greater

incomes and benefits (including pensions) as well as greater
value in the labor market. Relative to men, women should be
less likely to see themselves leveraging their occupational
advantages into complex paths to retirement. Mindful of
marital and family claims on their time, they should also
have greater uncertainty about retirement. Race mirrors
gender in many ways. Past employment discrimination to-
ward non-Whites may, in particular, have steered them into
occupations that are less likely to be covered by pensions
(Belgrave, 1988; Gibson, 1987). This would serve to limit
the range of choices, especially the option of early retirement
with continued employment. Age, as an index of time,
should funnel individuals toward greater certainty about
retirement and a more realistic appraisal of choices
(Henretta, 1994). In another sense, older age indexes survi-
vorship at work and foreclosed chances to enact more com-
plex plans.
Considering the work situation, pension eligibility, other
than Social Security, is an important predictor of retirement
behavior (Gustman, Mitchell, and Steinmeier, 1994; Quinn,
Burkhauser, and Myers, 1990), and we expect it to be a
major context for retirement planning, particularly the op-
tion of complete retirement. First, the pension may promise
enough income to excuse future employment. Second, pen-
sion offerings may carry rules that require a complete with-
drawal from the labor force. Third, detailed pension rules
may also focus workers on the eventuality of retirement, thus
reducing uncertainty (Ekerdt, Vinick, and Bosse, 1989). A
binary indicator of coverage by a private pension (other than
Social Security) was derived from HRS items about work-
ers' participation in employer's pension or tax-deferred
retirement plan, as well as self-employed workers' participa-
tion in Keogh plans.
Employment in the core industrial sector, defined as
oligopolies or monopolies, is an occupational context in
which workers are more likely to have pension coverage and
steady work histories, thus encouraging specific plans for
retirement (Hendricks and McAllister, 1983). The career
patterns and informal timetables that are strong in core
industries also convey expectations about the timing for
retirement (Henretta, 1994). A binary indicator of core
employment for respondents' current occupation was based
on Beck, Horan, and Tolbert's (1978) measure of the dual
economy.
Workers who have greater control over their circum-
stances of work, as indexed by occupational prestige, can
command more choices and more rewards than workers in
lower prestige occupations. Such labor market advantages
would increase the conceivability and attainability of post-
career positions, second careers, and partial retirements --
the complex paths to retirement (O'Rand, 1986). Current,
main occupations were coded for prestige according to
scores used by the National Opinion Research Center for the
General Social Survey (Davis and Smith, 1990).
Self-employment is an interesting status that, overall,
would be less likely to channel workers to a full retirement
(Quinn, 1980). Self-employment tends to foster personal
investment in the job situation, with a higher cost to individ-
ual identity for a complete withdrawal from work. To con-
serve that identity, self-employed workers may refuse to
entertain retirement plans. At the same time, being one's
own boss should give the self-employed greater ability to
reduce hours and slip into partial retirement. Self-
employment on the main job was incorporated in the analysis
as a binary variable.
Among individual factors, education gives individuals
greater market control and hence a wider range of prospec-
tive choices for retirement (Campbell and Henretta, 1976).
More years of education, while associated with pension
coverage, are also associated with occupations that have
noneconomic rewards -- gratifications that an individual
may want to conserve with extended employment arrange-
ments. Education was measured in years of formal school-
ing, coded in the HRS to a maximum of 17 years.
Just as health limitations prompt retirement behavior, so
these circumstances should also focus workers' retirement
plans away from uncertainty and toward a full retirement or a
reduction in effort (Hayward and Hardy, 1985). Health was
measured by a binary indicator of work limitations, derived
from a "yes" answer regarding any impairment or health
problem that limits one's kind or amount of paid work.
Marital status, finally, should influence individual work-
ers' view of the future. Married couples, for example, tend
to conceive of retirement as a conjugal project (Vinick and
Ekerdt, 1991), and so married workers should have more
certainty about their retirement plans and should also favor
the full-retirement option as a greater resource for their time
in retirement. Marital status was included as a binary indica-
tor: currently married versus all other groups.
Data Analysis
The consistency of the plans categories with analogous
survey questions was examined with cross-classifications.
The construct validity of the categories was examined with a
multinomial logistic regression technique (Aldrich and Nel-
son, 1984). The technique generated estimates of the likeli-
hood of "membership" in one category of retirement plans
versus another category given one's standing or score on an
independent variable net of other independent variables. The
10 independent variables measured aspects of workers' op-
portunity structure as described above. Nonlinear effects for
age, occupational prestige, and education were not detected.
The results presented here describe contrasts between all
possible pairs of the plans construct.
RESULTS
The proportion of the sample assigned to each of the
retirement plans categories is shown in Table 1, along with
other information about the convergent validity of the plans
classification. The plans categories can be understood as
older workers' current idea about their next move; we can
assume that people may have further ideas and that their
current plans may change.
As we have categorized them, approximately one-fifth of
these workers aged 51-61 planned to Stop Altogether -- the
classic, complete retirement. Another one-fifth foresaw a
path of Reduced Effort. Nine percent thought that they
would remain at work full-time (as best we can determine)
but Change Job or switch to self-employment. Approxi-
mately 7 percent said that they will Never Stop working. An
RETIREMENT PLANS S145
unexpected aspect of the plans distribution was the finding
that more than two-fifths of these workers had specifically
stated that they had No Plans regarding retirement.
Cumulative distributions of planned ages for three of
these transitions are also shown in Table 1. The Change Job
group planned more moves by age 60 than the Reduce and
Stop groups, consistent with their embarking sooner on a
more complex path toward withdrawal from work. In all
three groups, approximately 70 percent of transitions were
foreseen to occur by age 62 or sooner, and over 90 percent
by age 65.
Convergent Validity of the Plans Categories
The validity of the plans categories can be evaluated by
examining group responses on three analogous survey ques-
tions -- each of which in different ways also asks about work
and retirement expectations (Table 1, Nos. 1-3). The first of
these asked about the chances of working full-time (gener-
ally, not just at the present job) after reaching age 62 and
then age 65. As would be expected, the Stop group cited the
lowest chances of working past age 62 or 65, and the Never
Stop group cited the highest chances of continuing full-time.
The other three groups fell between these extremes. Separate
one-way analyses of variance with post-hoc contrasts
showed that the means of all groups significantly differed
from one another across the past-62 and past-65 rows in
Table 1, with the exception of the Reduce and Change Job
groups. This raises the possibility that these two groups
could be collapsed in further analyses, a matter to be ad-
dressed later.
Another survey question (Table 1, No. 2) asked explicitly
about expected retirement date or age, with the meaning of
retirement as full or partial being left to the respondent.
(Note that the question used to form the plans categories had
suggested various work/retirement options that workers
might be considering.) As is usual for this type of question
about expected retirement age, most respondents gave a
date/age, but some had no response or said "never" (Nes-
tel, 1985).
Responses to the expected-age question are particularly
helpful for validating the Stop category. Nearly all workers
planning to Stop Altogether cited an expected age for retire-
ment and, cumulatively, 88.6 percent expected to retire by
age 65. For the Reduce Effort and Change Job groups,
expected ages were distributed somewhat later than among
the Stop group; approximately 60 percent expected to retire
by age 65. Such distributions are consistent with these
groups' stated plans for continued employment arrange-
ments. Also, some 12-14 percent of these groups said that
they expected to work indefinitely (expect "never" to re-
tire). Nonetheless, the majority of workers with present
plans to Reduce employment or Change Jobs still foresaw
themselves as eventually retiring.
Appropriately, the modal response category for the
Never Stop group was expecting "never" to retire
(48.2%). Some workers in the Never Stop group did cite a
retirement age, which possibly signals their expectation of
an intermediate retirement "event" even as they maintain
the long-range view that they will work indefinitely,
whether at paid or unpaid pursuits. Finally, the No Plans
group has expected-age responses distributed with more
heterogeneity than other groups.
The last item (No. 3) used to validate the plans categories
was a question asking workers if they would like to continue
doing some paid work when they retire (even though they
may elsewhere have said that they would never retire). This
question seems to tap preferences over plans. The Stop
group is most apt to have favored stopping entirely, but a
good proportion (38%) nevertheless said that they would like
to continue some work. Whether they will actually pursue
postretirement employment is not certain. Over 85 percent
of the Reduce Effort, Change Job, and Never Stop groups
preferred continued work. The No Plans group, too, was
attracted to continued work.
To sum up, the comparisons of the plans groups on
analogous survey questions show reasonable consistency
about intentions toward retirement. Those who plan to Stop
Altogether project retirement transitions substantially com-
pleted by age 62 and almost wholly completed by age 65;
they express little uncertainty about expected retirement
ages; and they are the group most likely by far to prefer no
postretirement employment. The Reduce Effort and Change
Job groups resemble each other in foreseeing longer work
careers on average than the Stop group, later and even
indefinite expected retirement dates, and strong favor for
partial retirement. From the evidence so far, these two
groups may differ more in degree than in kind. The Never
Stop group, while some may eventually retire, presently
foresee the longest work careers and the least likelihood of
ever retiring. And as it should be, the No Plans group are
hardest to profile, projecting longer worker careers than the
Reduce Effort and Change Job groups, but not foreclosing
retirement so strongly as the Never Stop group.
Plans and Opportunity
Having defined and characterized the groups in terms of
their retirement plans and intentions, we next examine
whether plans are associated with selected situational and
biographical factors that should, in theory, channel workers
toward certain intentions about retirement. A formal theoret-
ical model of the opportunity structure as it predicts specific
retirement plans would show complex relations among fac-
tors, with some factors, such as pension eligibility, endoge-
nous to others. Our present purpose is heuristic and more
modest: to explore the construct validity of plans with
reference to some key elements of the opportunity structure.
Simple associations between the plans categories, as sepa-
rate binary indicators, and elements of the opportunity struc-
ture are shown in Table 2 (missing data on some variables
reduces the pool of cases to 4,746). The correlations are
shown mainly as a reference for the discussion of multivari-
ate results in Table 3.
Table 3 shows estimates of the likelihood of workers'
preference for one plan category over another as predicted by
a set of 10 independent variables. For each independent
variable, the matrix of table entries are antilogged logit
coefficients that estimate the change in the odds ratio when
the predictor variable changes by one unit. If reading across
the rows, the entries represent the likelihood of membership
in the row category versus the column category (conversely if

reading down the columns). Values greater than 1 reflect
increased odds; values less than 1 reflect decreased odds. For
example, in the first row of the matrix for the first variable,
Female, the value 1.49 indicates that women are more likely
than men to have plans to stop altogether (row category) than
to reduce hours (column category). For the third variable in
Table 3, Age, the value .92 in the third row specifies how an
additional year of age decreases the odds of the change-job
plan (row category) versus the stop-completely plan (column
category). Interpretations of the entries above the diagonal
are the inverse of those below the diagonal (because the
numerators and denominators of the odds ratios are inverted).
Unlike our Table 3, results from multinomial logistic
regression are usually shown as contrasts between a refer-
ence category of the dependent variable and its other catego-
ries. Here we have included all contrasts between plans
categories because different contrasts are of interest depend-
ing on the predictor in question. Readers can manage the
detail of each matrix by reading rows for sets of coefficients
of consistent size and direction. Also shown in Table 3 are
nested likelihood-ratio chi-square tests for the contribution
of the variable to the model net of the other variables.
Two of three ascribed statuses are reasonably predictive of
retirement plans, and in anticipated ways. Female workers,
adjusting for other factors in the model, are less likely than
males to have plans to Reduce employment or Change Jobs
relative to other options, and they are more likely to have No
Plans. Put another way, men are more likely than women to
choose complex plans about retirement and are less apt to be
found without plans, suggesting a different preretirement
process for men and women.
Retirement plans were significantly but not strongly dif-
ferentiated by race. Older age, however, seems to close off
options and raise the certainty of plans substantially. Older
workers were less likely to plan a job change and less likely
to have no plans.
Plans also appear to be formed in the context of the work
situation. The expectation of a private pension clearly fo-
cuses workers' plans. Prospective pensioners are more likely
to plan a complete retirement and they are less often found
among those who would never retire or have no plans. In this
validation model, the pension indicator probably obscures
the effect of core-sector employment on retirement plans.
Pension receipt tends to accompany employment in large,
formal organizations (the correlation between these two
variables here was .21). In a fully specified analytic model of
certain plans categories, pension status would be endoge-
nous to core employment. Likewise, occupational prestige
shows a zero-order relationship to certain plans categories
(Table 2), but no substantial relationship in the multivariate
setting (Table 3), probably due to the relationship between
prestige and education (r = .50).
Self-employment is a fairly strong predictor of retirement
plans and in a way that distinguishes the two complex paths
to retirement, Reduce Effort and Change Job. Relative to
other options, the self-employed are more likely to favor
reduced employment as their next step but unlikely to favor a
job change. The self-employed tend to say they are headed
for partial retirement but in the same job situation.
The final three predictors in Table 3 represent individual
characteristics. Education, in a full analytic model of retire-
ment plans, would be exogenous to other factors in the
opportunity structure. In this simple validation model,
higher education somewhat recaps effects observed for male
gender: greater favor for the complex paths and greater
certainty. Respondents with a self-reported work limitation
due to health are as likely to entertain one type of plan as
another, both in the bivariate and multivariate setting. Per-
haps the expected health effect on retirement plans is mani-
fest only late in the retirement process. Married respondents,
finally, favor the option of stopping completely and are less
likely to say that they plan never to retire, prospective views
consistent with couples' anticipation of retirement as a
resource for companionship.
One remaining question about our five-category construct
(and our use of the multinomial model) is whether we could
do with fewer categories because some are redundant or
close alternatives. For example, results in Table 1 suggest
that the Reduce Effort and Change Job types might be
collapsed together. An important assumption of the multino-
mial logit model concerns what is often referred to as "the
independence of irrelevant alternatives" or IIS assumption
(Zhang and Hoffman, 1993). This assumption, which itself
arises from the assumption that the discrete outcome variable
is multinomially distributed, essentially assumes that the
relative probability of choosing between any two alternative
outcomes is independent of all the other alternatives. In the
present application, for instance, this would mean that the
relative probability of choosing "Stop Altogether" versus
"Never Stop" is independent of all the other choices.
Moreover, this difference in relative probabilities would be
assumed to hold regardless of the number of alternatives
available in the choice set. Clearly, such an assumption
could not be met if some of the alternatives were close
substitutes for one another. To test the plausibility of this
assumption in the present study, we estimated the model on a
restricted set of choices (constructed by randomly eliminat-
ing various alternatives from the choice set). Parameter
estimates were virtually identical to those obtained using the
full set of outcomes, thereby supporting the viability of the
IIS assumption.
DISCUSSION
In the foregoing analyses we have sought to demonstrate
the validity of a five-category construct that can be used to
describe the retirement intentions of older workers. The five
general types of retirement plans -- stop altogether, reduce
effort, change jobs, never retire, and no plans -- were
operationalized among 51- to 61-year-old workers in the
baseline sample of the Health and Retirement Study, from
which source other information was used to demonstrate
reasonable convergent and construct validity for the catego-
ries. The scheme, we would argue, has heuristic value
because it recognizes the heterogeneity of retirement inten-
tions, including the refusal to entertain plans ("never re-
tire") and uncertainty about the future.
As operationalized here, we sorted workers into mutually
exclusive groups according to their general plans. This
strategy, treating workers as if they were one-plan people set
on singular paths to the future, may be too simple. Rather, a
S148 EKERDT ET AL.
worker's commitment to any of the plan scenarios could be a
matter of degree. (The HRS items that ask workers their
subjective probability of working full-time past age 62 or 65
are indeed such a test for degree of commitment to a
particular, though oddly mixed, intention: nonretirement at a
particular age.) Although few HRS respondents cited multi-
ple plans, it is reasonable to suppose that some older men
and women, while not uncertain about retirement, could
have ambivalent intentions or mixed plans.
At any rate, whether it is more appropriate to think of
workers as planning a single course or as having propensities
toward two or three retirement arrangements -- this is a
matter for research. The question could be investigated by
estimating the probability that workers will subscribe to each
of the plan types based on responses to the sort of questions
used to establish construct validity in Table 1. Latent vari-
ables describing each worker's propensity to stop altogether,
reduce effort, etc., could be compared with the single
multinomial construct to determine the relative usefulness of
the two approaches for summarizing how workers think
about retirement.
Over and above validation research on the construct itself,
we foresee three broad applications of the construct for
studies of retirement decision making. First, as noted in our
introduction, the plans construct can be the organizing idea
for an elaborated, though loose, taxonomy of retirement
plans. Subsidiary to our idea of general plans, one could
classify specific plans and expectations regarding employ-
ment, transition timing, financial arrangements, and life
style. Plans themselves, general and specific, could be
thought of as a subset of the wider experience of retirement
anticipation (or late careers), which also encompasses retire-
ment preparation behaviors and other attitudes.
Holding general plans conceptually separate from specific
plans provides analytic and interpretive advantages. Know-
ing the general intention, for example, enhances the intelli-
gibility of data on expected timing of retirement. In addition,
specific plans for occupational continuity, job change, or
self-employment are only pertinent to certain general plans.
Specific life-style plans (e.g., to conserve one's health, to
migrate) may be pertinent only to other general intentions
such as full retirement. The don't-know responses disclosed
by survey items about probable timing of retirement or
Social Security receipt might be usefully regarded not as
missing data but as positive indicators of a broad uncertainty
about retirement. In all this, we recognize that the hierarchy
of retirement plans is conceptual; single specific plans (to
migrate, to preside over the family business) may in fact
drive all other plans for the future.
The second application is to studies of extended decision
making for retirement. As outlined in our introduction, it is
helpful to think of workers as putting themselves on a path
toward retirement or late career transitions -- paths conceiv-
able because of one's location in a structure of opportunity,
and paths sustained by instrumental preparation steps. Plans
made and remade are the manifest aspect of extended deci-
sion making and, assuming longitudinal data for the con-
firmation of lagged relationships, specific plans can be
modeled as the outcome of structure and situation. Who
entertains plans for complex arrangements (e.g., partial
retirement), or who characteristically faces the future with
uncertainty? If plans are unstable, is it because opportunity
has changed, or because workers have misinterpreted the
probability of favorable events (Frisch, 1988)? Analyses can
also consider whether preparation steps solidify intentions,
with the "returns" on preparation becoming part of the
opportunity structure for subsequent intentions. One hypoth-
esis, for example: Workers' resolve to retire all at once
prompts saving behavior that later reinforces the conceiv-
ability of a full-stop retirement. Our contention, in all, is that
consequential decisions about retirement are made far in
advance of the event.
Regarding stability and change, the plans construct could
also help chart secular trends in retirement anticipation. The
HRS cohort members studied here, born in 1931-1941 and
reaching age 20 during the 1950s, have had a historically
contingent experience with work careers, depending on
gender. They now face retirement less able than preceding
cohorts to rely on assumptions about protected career lines
and about welfare state promises of social security
(Henretta, 1994). Assuming that this cohort and oncoming
cohorts face greater uncertainty about the life course, they
should come to distribute themselves differently among the
general intentions toward retirement (e.g., fewer full-stop
plans and more complex plans).
The construct can be applied, thirdly, to the explanation of
retirement and late career behaviors, using it to depict the
path of plans over time. The factors that conventionally
predict retirement outcomes -- gender, pension profile,
marital status -- might better be understood as doing so
because they shape the path of retirement intentions. Tempo-
rally deep intentions, we suspect, are more likely to be
fulfilled and, we also suspect, more likely to be held by
socially and economically advantaged workers (Ekerdt,
Vinick, and Bosse, 1989). People on paths of erratic and
inchoate plans will arrive at the same outcomes as those with
deep plans -- fully retired, extended employment, partial
retirement -- but possibly quite earlier or later, and with less
assurance of a satisfying experience with retirement. Our
perspective is that many workers retire as they do because
they have meant to, and those aims can be traced upstream
from events.
The focus on retirement plans puts a developmental em-
phasis on retirement decision making, usefully so because it
rescues research from casting older workers, on the one
hand, as point-of-purchase "deciders" or, on the other
hand, as fated by social context. There is now great interest
in the retirement behavior of the next decades, and we
suggest that the decisions about that behavior are already
being made.
