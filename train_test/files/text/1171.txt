Racial/Ethnic Differences in the Relationship
Between the Use of Health Care Services and
Functional Disability: The Health and
Retirement Study (1992­2004)

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine
racial/ethnic differences in the relationship between
functional disability and the use of health care
services in a nationally representative sample of older
adults by using the Andersen behavioral model of
health services utilization. Design and Methods:
The study used 12 years of longitudinal data from
the Health and Retirement Study (1992­2004),
a nationally representative sample of community-
dwelling adults older than 50 in 1992 (N = 8,947).
Nonlinear multilevel models used self-reported health
care service utilization (physician visits and hospital
admissions) to predict racial/ethnic differences in
disability (activities of daily living and mobility
limitations). The models also evaluated the roles of
other predisposing (age and gender), health need
(medical conditions and self-rated health), and en-
abling factors (health insurance, education, income,
and wealth). Results: Blacks and Latinos utilizing
physician visits and hospital admissions were associ-
ated with significantly more activity of daily living
disability than Whites (p , .001). Blacks utilizing
physician visits (p , .001) and hospital admissions
(p , .05) and Latinos utilizing hospital admissions
(p , .05) were associated with more mobility
disability than Whites. Other predisposing, health
need, and enabling factors did not account for these
racial/ethnic differences. Implications: Nationally,
health care use for Blacks and Latinos was associated
with more disabilities than for Whites after we ac-
counted for predisposing, health need, and enabling
factors. The findings suggest that improving health
care quality for all Americans may supersede equal
access to health care for reducing ethnic and racial
disparities in functional health.

About 20% to 30% of community-dwelling older
adults report disability, or difficulties performing ac-
tivities of daily living (ADLs; Adams, Hendershot, &
Marano, 1999). Disabilities in self-care and physical
functioning are associated with a loss of indepen-
dence, an increased need for health care services, and
subsequently higher health care costs (Liu, Wall, &
Wissoker, 1997; Sands et al., 2006). For example,
older adults with these disabilities have 3 times the
medical expenditures of those without these disabil-
ities (Trupin, Rice, & Max, 1996). The leading cause
of disability is chronic disease, with disease type and
severity varying the level of functional disability and
the need for health care services (Fried & Guralnik,
1997). In a widely used behavioral model of health
services use, Andersen and Newman (1973) suggested
that economic access to health care (or enabling
factors) and predisposing factors (e.g., age, gender,
and race/ethnicity) also influence disability and the
use of health care services.

Advancements in medical technology and treat-
ment have led to a compression of morbidity and
subsequent declines in disability rates (Cutler, 2001;
Fries, 2003; Manton & Gu, 2001; Schoeni, Martin,
Andreski, & Freedman, 2005). Although disability
rates among elders have been declining overall,
racial/ethnic differences in disability persist (Schoeni
et al., 2005). This may be because Blacks and
Latinos have more underlying medical problems
than Whites, including diabetes and heart conditions,
poorer self-rated health (Angel & Angel, 1998;
Farmer & Ferraro, 2005; Kington & Smith, 1997;
Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1997), and fewer eco-
nomic resources to pay for needed health care services
(Gornick et al., 1996; Schoenbaum & Waidmann,
1997; Weinick, Zuvekas, & Cohen, 2000). Racial/
ethnic differences in disability may also result from
differences in health care treatment and quality, with
older Blacks and Latinos disadvantaged relative to
Whites (Ayanian, Cleary, Weissman, & Epstein, 1999;
Escarce, Epstein, Colby, & Schwartz, 1993).
This study used the Andersen (Andersen &
Newman, 1973) behavioral model of health services
utilization to conceptualize the relationship between
racial/ethnic differences in disability and the use of
health care services, accounting for other predispos-
ing (age, gender), health need (medical conditions
and self-rated health), and enabling (economic access
to health care services) factors.
Health Care Service Utilization
Minorities may have more economic barriers to
health care and may use fewer health care services
than Whites (Gornick et al., 1996; Kington & Smith,
1997). As a result of delayed care, Blacks and Latinos
may enter the health care system with more severe
medical conditions and more preventable hospital-
izations than Whites (Ebell, Smith, Kruse, Drader-
Wilcox, & Novak, 1995; Gaskin & Hoffman, 2000;
Gourin & Podolsky, 2006; Horner, Lawler, & Hainer,
1991), though this is contested (Blustein, Hanson, &
Shea, 1998). Some studies have argued that economic
access to health care services does not explain racial/
ethnic differences in health service use. For example,
Fiscella, Franks, Doescher, and Saver (2002) reported
that racial/ethnic differences in the use of health care
services persisted after the researchers accounted for
health insurance type and income. Dunlop, Manheim,
Song, and Chang (2002) reported similar results
among an older adult population.
Cultural differences in care-seeking behaviors may
influence health care service utilization. Though some
studies have found no racial differences in the
willingness to use health care services (Schnittker,
Pescosolido, & Croghan, 2005), other studies have
shown that Black and Latino adults have more
distrust than Whites of medical research, clinicians,
and a physician's judgment (Corbie-Smith, Thomas,
Williams, & Moody-Ayers, 1999). As a result, mi-
nority group members may rely more than Whites on
hospital-based and community health clinics, which
have been associated with lower quality care than
private physicians (Henry J. Kaiser Family Founda-
tion, 2007). Minorities may also be less likely than
Whites to adhere to prescribed medications, which
may negatively influence health outcomes (Hall,
Dugan, Zheng, & Mishra, 2001; Petersen, 2002).
Disparities in the Health Care System
Racial/ethnic differences in the use of health care
services may not explain some disparities in the health
care system, however. There are notable differences in
health care treatment and quality among older Black,
Latino, and White patients. For example, older Black
patients receive poorer management of chronic
conditions than older Whites (Ayanian et al., 1999;
Davis, Liu, & Gibbons, 2003). Studies examining
hospital discharge data have found that older Blacks
and Latinos are also less likely than Whites to receive
a wide range of medical procedures, including revas-
cularization after coronary angiography (Ayanian,
Udvarhelyi, Gatsonis, Pashos, & Epstein, 1993;
Harris, Andrews, & Elixhauser, 1997; Peterson,
Wright, Daley, & Thibault, 1994), surgical resection
for early-stage lung cancer (Bach, Cramer, Warren, &
Begg, 1999), bone marrow transplants for leukemia
andlymphoma(Mitchell,Meehan,Kong,&Schulman,
1997), beta blocker medications for heart attack, and
eyeexaminationsfordiabetes(Schneider,Zaslavsky,&
Epstein, 2002). Additionally, these racial/ethnic dif-
ferences in treatment have not been explained by
hospital size, type, or location; health insurance; or
disease severity (Giles, Anda, Casper, Escobedo, &
Taylor, 1995; McBean, Warren, & Babish, 1994).
Older minority group members may also benefit less
than Whites do from improvements in health care
treatments. For example, Escarce and colleagues
(1993) showed that older Whites have better access
to new procedures and other specialized and high-
technology services than do older Blacks.
Racial/ethnic differences in access to quality
physicians and medical care may partly explain these
individual differences in health care treatment and
quality. Blacks are more likely than Whites to rely on
neighborhood health centers, outpatient hospital care,
or emergency rooms for health care, whereas Whites
aremorelikelytohaveprivatephysicians(forareview,
see Mayberry, Mili, & Ofili, 2000; Walls, Rhodes, &
Kennedy, 2002). In addition to less satisfactory
patient­physician relationships, the health care set-
tings used predominantly by minorities are character-
ized by longer wait times, overcrowding, and less
continuity of care (Derlet, Richards, & Kravitz, 2001).
Older Blacks, Whites, and Latinos may also have
different physicians and seek care in different
hospitals (Bach, Pham, Schrag, Tate, & Hargraves,
660 The Gerontologist
2004; Barnato, Lucas, Staiger, Wennberg, & Chandra,
2005; Hasnain-Wynia et al., 2007). The physicians
serving predominantly minority patients are less likely
to be board certified and have less access to clinical
resources (Bach et al., 2004). Additionally, hospitals
serving predominantly minority patients are more
likely to have nursing shortages and to be inade-
quately funded (Mannion, Davies, & Marshall, 2005).
The aim of this study was to adapt the Andersen
(Andersen & Newman, 1973) behavioral model of
health services utilization to examine racial/ethnic
differences in the relationship between functional
disability and the use of health care services. Though
researchers have widely used this model to predict
health service utilization, our application of this
model extends beyond its original scope. Previous
work has shown greater health need, fewer enabling
resources, and poorer health care treatment and
quality among older minorities compared to Whites.
Based on the literature documenting disparities in
health care treatment and quality, we hypothesized
that older Blacks and Latinos utilizing health care
services would have more functional disability than
Whites independent of other predisposing (age,
gender), health need (medical conditions and self-
rated health), and enabling (education, income, and
wealth) factors. Because we lacked data to explicitly
examine racial/ethnic differences in the quality of
health care services, we made the assumption that
some of the racial/ethnic differences in functional
disability may be associated with racial/ethnic differ-
ences in health care service treatment and quality.
Methods
Data
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is
a nationally representative ongoing longitudinal mul-
tistage probability survey of community-dwelling
older adults. The first wave of the HRS occurred in
1992 with a 51- to 61-year-old cohort that has been
interviewed subsequently every 2 years. Further details
on the HRS design and methods have been published
previously (see Heeringa & Connor, 1995). We ana-
lyzed seven waves of data (1992­2004) from the HRS
that were prepared by the RAND Center for the
Study ofAging(RANDHRS).The benefitsof using the
RAND HRS data include a collection of detailed
health, socioeconomic status, and utilization informa-
tion and the use of bracketing methods to minimize
nonresponse for these data (RAND HRS Data, 2006).
In order to generalize our findings to the community-
dwellingolderadultpopulation,weexcludedfromthis
study respondents with sampling weights of zero
(indicating they were institutionalized or deceased).
Previous work has suggested that attrition rates
in the HRS are comparable to those of other panel
surveys (Groves & Couper, 1998) and that sample
attrition has not significantly influenced the repre-
sentativeness of the remaining sample based on de-
mographic, economic, and health measures (Cao &
Hill, 2005). Data were weighted using HRS
respondent-level sampling weights to account for
the sample design in the HRS (Heeringa & Connor,
1995). Approximately 71.5% of respondents partic-
ipated in all seven waves of the HRS (1992­2004).
By 2004, 12.9% of respondents were deceased and
15.6% were lost to follow-up. There were 8,947
adults in our sample after we excluded proxy inter-
views from respondents unable to answer survey
questions independently at baseline. More than 80%
of the sample was White, 11.5% was Black, 6.3%
was Latino, and 2% identified as ``other.''
Variable Measurement
In this study, the main variables of interest were
measured at baseline (1992) and subsequently every
2 years except for gender, race/ethnicity, and educa-
tion, which were fixed. This allowed us to examine
intraindividual changes in health need, enabling
factors, and associated disability over the course of
the survey.
Dependent Variables
As this study was primarily interested in disabilities
in self-care and functioning that are associated with
a loss of independence and increased health care costs
(Clark, Stump, Hui, & Wolinsky, 1998; Liu et al.,
1997), we measured disability by ADLs and mobility.
Respondents were asked if they needed assistance(yes/
no) performing any of five basic ADLs (walking across
a room, bathing, eating, dressing, and getting into and
out of bed) and if they had some difficulty (yes/no)
walking one block, walking several blocks, walking
across a room, climbing one flight of stairs, and
climbing several flights of stairs. Based on responses to
these questions, we scored respondents on two scales
ranging from 0 to 5, with 5 indicating the most
disabilities on each scale. We did not examine further
instrumental ADLs because these questions were
asked inconsistently over the course of the survey.
Independent Variables
The main independent variables of interest in this
study were race/ethnicity and the use of health care
services. We measured race/ethnicity by using three
mutually exclusive racial/ethnic classifications: (non-
Latino) Black, Latino, and (non-Latino) White. We
used HRS respondents from the other racial/ethnic
groups as controls in our analysis and do not report
their results here. We measured health care service
use by self-reports of physician visits and hospital
admissions. Respondents were asked how many
times they had visited a physician or had a hospital
admission in the past 12 months (at baseline) and
Vol. 48, No. 5, 2008 661
between survey interviews (every 2 years). There is
evidence that older adults underreport their use of
health care services and that distributions of health
service use are non-normal (Roberts, Bergstralh,
Schmidt, & Jacobsen, 1996; Wallihan, Stump, &
Callahan, 1999). In an attempt to address this issue,
we log-transformed reports of service use. Through
log-transformations, we captured the variance in
health service use over time while also drawing
outlying data from a skewed distribution closer to
the bulk of the data.
Guided by the Andersen (Andersen & Newman,
1973) model of health services utilization, we
accounted for other predisposing factors associated
with the use of health care services, including gender
(male = 0, female = 1) and age (which was group
mean centered at age 65 for ease of interpreta-
tion and to restrict problems with collinearity;
Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). To account for health
need, we included self-reports (yes/no) of doctor-
diagnosed medical conditions including diabetes or
high blood sugar; cancer or a malignant tumor of
any kind except skin cancer; chronic lung disease
except asthma, such as bronchitis or emphysema;
heart problems (heart attack, coronary heart disease,
angina, congestive heart failure, or other heart prob-
lems); and stroke (Angel & Angel, 1998; Kington &
Smith, 1997; Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1997).
Researchers have reported reasonable concordance
values between self-reports of medical conditions
and medical chart reviews (Bush, Miller, Golden, &
Hale, 1989; Pasty et al., 1995). We also accounted
for self-rated health (a Likert scale ranging from 0­4,
where 4 is poor health), as it is highly correlated with
physician-assessed health conditions and is a global
evaluation of health status (Idler & Kasl, 1991).
We measured enabling factors by education (0­17þ
years), income (logged value of total household
income, including earnings, pensions, and Social
Security), wealth (logged value of wealth, including
all assets minus the sum of all debt, including mort-
gages), and health insurance (Medicare, Medicaid,
Veterans/other governmental, employer provided,
private, and no insurance).
Data Analysis
We used multilevel statistical modeling using
Hierarchical Linear Modeling software Version 6.02
(HLM; Scientific Software International, Lincoln-
wood, IL) to examine individual and aggregate levels
of data over time and to account for the complex
HRS sampling design and the subset analyzed.
Basically, multilevel modeling in HLM conceives of
each individual as having his or her own regression
equation. Multilevel modeling in HLM has several
benefits. When used to examine growth curve
models, HLM provides a powerful statistical tool to
test hypothesized models of growth or change. Also,
because multiple observations are nested within each
person over time, the number and spacing of time
points can vary across cases (Raudenbush & Bryk,
2002). HLM also handles missing data through
iterative, numerical approaches.
Many functional disability distributions, such as
those used in this study, can be non-normal, reflecting
the higher frequency of intact functioning among the
general older adult population. As such, we considered
alternative disability distributions in HLM. Nonlinear
models that modeled Poisson distributions of the ADL
and mobility data fit better than the linear models. We
report here the results of the nonlinear analyses. In
each of the disability models, we tested a growth term
(age2) for growth curve analysis (Raudenbush & Bryk,
2002) and accounted for other predisposing factors
(age and gender) to examine racial/ethnic differences
in the relationship between the use of health care
services and functional disability. Next we sequen-
tially added health need (medical conditions and self-
rated health) and enabling (education, income, and
wealth) factors to the disability models.
Results
Bivariate Results
As shown in Table 1, there were racial/ethnic
differences in medical conditions and self-rated
health, with Blacks and Latinos disadvantaged
relative to Whites. Minority group members were
also more likely than Whites to have Medicaid or no
insurance and were less likely than Whites to have
private or employer insurance. Blacks and Latinos
also had fewer years of education, less income, and
less wealth than Whites. In this study, ADL and
mobility disabilities were modestly correlated with
each other (r = .52), self-rated health (ADL, r = .30;
mobility, r = .51), and medical conditions (ADL,
r = .51; mobility, r = .41).
There were also racial/ethnic differences in the use
of health care services and disability over the course
of the survey (see Table 2). Throughout much of the
survey period, Latinos were less likely than Whites to
report a physician visit, and Blacks were more likely
to report more frequent visits to physicians than
Whites. In the early years of the survey, Blacks were
more likely than Whites to report a hospital admis-
sion and reported more frequent hospital admis-
sions. Minorities were also more likely than Whites
to have ADL and mobility disabilities over the course
of the survey.
Multivariate Results
The significance of the growth term indicated that
ADL disability increased with age, and this model
was maintained throughout the analysis (data not
shown). As Table 3 shows, after we accounted for
662 The Gerontologist
predisposing factors, physician visits (0.21; p , .001)
were associated with ADL disabilities, though Blacks
(0.14; p , .001) and Latinos (0.11; p , .01) with
physician visits were associated with more ADL
disability than their White counterparts. The addi-
tions of health need and enabling factors into the
models did not account for the significant associa-
tions for Blacks and Latinos and ADL disability.
Overall, hospital admissions were associated with
more ADL disability (0.89; p , .001); however, the
associations were higher for Blacks (0.46; p , .001)
and Latinos (0.20; p , .01) compared to Whites.
With health need added to the model, the strength
of the relationship between hospital admissions
and ADL disability was substantially reduced (from
0.89 to 0.52). Introducing enabling factors did not
account for the relationship between hospital admis-
sions and ADL disability for Blacks and Latinos,
who continued to have more ADL disability than
Whites. The effect sizes for these models were
medium to large (range = 0.31­1.52).
In the mobility disability model, the significance of
the growth term indicated that mobility disabilities
increased with age, and this model was maintained
throughout the analysis (data not shown). Table 4
shows the relationship between the use of health care
services and mobility disability. Physician visits were
associated with mobility disability (0.69; p , .001),
though Blacks (0.14; p , .001) and Latinos (0.11;
p , .01) with physician visits were associated with
more mobility disability than their White counter-
parts. After additional adjustments for health need
and enabling factors, Blacks continued to have more
mobility disability than Whites, though health need
better explained this relationship among Latinos.
Hospital admissions were also associated with
mobility disability (2.03; p , .001). The relationship
between race/ethnicity, hospital admissions, and
mobility disability approached significance (p ,
.10) in the predisposing model. When we accounted
for health need, Blacks (0.23; p , .05) and Latinos
(0.25; p , .05) with hospital admissions were
associated with significantly more mobility disability
than Whites. With health need in the model, the
strength of the relationship between hospital admis-
sions and mobility disability was substantially
reduced (from 2.03 to 0.92). Even after we accounted
for enabling factors, Blacks and Latinos continued to
be associated with more mobility disability than
Whites. The effect sizes for these models were
medium to large (range = 0.32­1.15).
Previous work has found that minorities, com-
pared to Whites, underutilize health care services
(e.g., Dunlop et al., 2002). We conducted an
additional analysis using race/ethnicity to predict
physician visits and hospital admissions. The pur-
pose of this analysis was to isolate the extent to
which racial/ethnic differences in the likelihood of
utilizing health care services may statistically explain
the observed racial/ethnic differences in ADL and
mobility disability. After accounting for other
predisposing, health need, and enabling factors, we
found that Blacks with economic access to health
care services were associated with more physician

Discussion
In this large, nationally representative longitu-
dinal study of community-dwelling older adults,
physician visits and hospital admissions for Blacks
and Latinos were associated with more ADL
disability than for Whites. In addition, physician
visits and hospital admissions for Blacks and
hospital admissions for Latinos were associated
with more mobility disability than for Whites. We
found that, over the course of this 12-year study,
there were racial/ethnic differences in the relation-
ship between the use of health care services and

functional disability. These findings provide support
for our hypothesis that racial/ethnic differences in
functional disability may be associated with racial/
ethnic differences in health care service treatment
and quality. These findings were not accounted for
by other predisposing (age and gender), health need
(medical conditions and self-rated health), and
enabling factors (economic access to health care),
which have been shown to influence health service
utilization (Andersen, 1995; Andersen & Newman,
1973).
Our study findings are consistent with those of
Schoeni and colleagues (2005), who reported persis-
tent racial/ethnic differences in disability. These
findings are also consistent with those of Wolinsky
and Johnson (1991), who reported that older
minority group members were no less likely than
older Whites to utilize health care services after the
researchers accounted for health need and enabling
factors. In this study, older Blacks with enabling
factors conducive to accessing health care services
were more likely than older Whites to visit
physicians. These findings contrast with those of
Dunlop and associates (2002), who found that older
Blacks and Latinos were less likely than Whites to
utilize health care services, even after the authors
accounted for economic access. Our findings may
differ because we examined respondent-level changes
in health need, enabling factors, and health care
service use over time and accounted for self-rated
health in our analysis.
Several potential explanations for our findings
should be considered. One explanation is that the
observed racial/ethnic differences in disability reflect
the severity of the medical conditions in our study
population. In this study, health need better
explained mobility disability among Latinos. How-
ever, health need did not explain the other racial/
ethnic differences in functional disability found in
this study. Although some studies have found that
minority group members enter the health care system
in worse health than Whites (Ebell et al., 1995;
Gourin & Podolsky, 2006; Horner et al., 1991), other
studies have argued that disease severity does not
explain racial/ethnic differences in health outcomes
(Giles et al., 1995; McBean et al., 1994; Schneider
et al., 2002). We were unable to investigate this
possibility directly because there are no data on the
severity of respondents' medical conditions in the
HRS. Nonetheless, because we captured prevalent
and incident cases of medical conditions over the
course of 12 years and this, along with enabling
factors, explained the racial/ethnic variance in
service utilization, we believe that this explanation
is unlikely, or at least that disease severity alone does
not explain the robust association between service
use and disability found in this study.
Another possible explanation for our findings is
that there are racial/ethnic differences in quality of
care. Previous work has shown that racial/ethnic
groups receive poorer chronic disease management
and fewer medical procedures and treatments than
Whites (Davis et al., 2003; Escarce et al., 1993;
Schneider et al., 2002). Focusing on the ways in
which minority group members receive differential
treatment than Whites may reduce disparities in
health care services. Whites are also more likely than
minority group members to have private physicians,
whereas Blacks and Latinos are more likely to use
neighborhood health centers, outpatient hospital
care, or emergency rooms for their health care needs
(Derlet et al., 2001; for a review, see Mayberry et al.,
2000; Walls et al., 2002). Increasing minority access
to primary care and dealing with issues such as
overcrowding and longer wait times in emergency
rooms may be effective strategies for reducing racial/
ethnic disparities in health care (Derlet et al., 2001;
Hasnain-Wynia et al., 2007). Older Blacks and
Latinos may also seek care from different physicians
and use different hospitals than Whites. Physicians
serving predominantly White patients are more likely
to be board certified and have access to more clinical
resources than those physicians serving mostly
minorities (Bach et al., 2004). Hospitals serving
predominantly Whites are more likely to be non-
profit or major teaching hospitals than those serving

minorities (Mannion et al., 2005; Yuan, Cooper,
Einstadter, Cebul, & Rimm, 2000). The health care
resources available to Whites compared to minorities
are associated with better health outcomes. These
differences in health care resources may explain the
findings of this study.
There are several limitations worth considering
when interpreting the results. First, we recognize that
health care service use rates are incomplete indica-
tors of access to health services and only record the
number of contacts with health professionals. We
attempted to address this issue in this study by
applying the Andersen (Andersen, 1995; Andersen &
Newman, 1973) model to account for health care
access enabling factors, health need, and changes in
these important factors over the 12-year study
period. Second, information on adherence to treat-
ment was not available in the HRS. Treatment
adherence, which differs by race/ethnicity, could
have affected disability rates in this study. Third, we
were unable to examine cultural differences in care-
seeking behaviors with the available HRS data.
Nevertheless, we found no evidence that older
minority group members were less likely to utilize
health care services than older Whites once impor-
tant factors from the Andersen model were consid-
ered. If anything, there was evidence that economic
access to physicians may increase utilization of
health care services among older Blacks. Addition-
ally, there is evidence that attrition is a persistent
problem in longitudinal studies (Groves & Couper,
1998). The rates of attrition in the HRS are not
unique compared to those of other panel surveys (see
Interagency Household Survey Nonresponse Group,
1998). To address attrition issues in this study we
examined a representative sample of community-
dwelling older adults who were less at risk for
mortality than institutionalized older adults and
excluded proxy interviews at baseline.
Despite these limitations, this study provides
important health policy implications. Our findings
indicate that although improving equality in eco-
nomic access to health care can result in substantial
reductions in disparities in the access to and use of
health care services, racial/ethnic disparities in
disability would remain. This suggests that improv-
ing economic access to health care services is im-
portant, but this may not be enough; the availability
of health insurance does not guarantee equal access
to high-quality care. These findings are consistent
with clinic-based and hospital discharge reports
suggesting that health policies are needed that
address both the micro (patient/physician interac-
tion) and macro (clinical resources/access to high-
quality physicians and hospitals) determinants of
health care quality (Smedley, Stith, & Nelson, 2002).
Future studies addressing racial/ethnic differences in
individual treatment and structural access to high-
quality clinicians, hospitals, and other health care
services may effectively outline strategies for the
reduction of disparities in the process and delivery of
health care services.
