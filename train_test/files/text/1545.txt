Background: Previous research on anesthesia-related mortal-
ity in the United States was limited to data from individual
hospitals. The purpose of this study was to examine the epide-
miologic patterns of anesthesia-related deaths at the national
level.
Methods: The authors searched the International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, 10th Revision manuals for codes specifically
related to anesthesia/anesthetics. These codes were used to
identify anesthesia-related deaths from the US multiple-cause-
of-death data files for the years 1999­2005. Rates from anesthe-
sia-related deaths were calculated based on population and hos-
pital surgical discharge data.
Results: The authors identified 46 anesthesia/anesthetic
codes, including complications of anesthesia during preg-
nancy, labor, and puerperium (O29.0­O29.9, O74.0­74.9,
O89.0­O89.9), overdose of anesthetics (T41.0­T41.4), adverse
effects of anesthetics in therapeutic use (Y45.0, Y47.1, Y48.0­
Y48.4, Y55.1), and other complications of anesthesia (T88.2­
T88.5, Y65.3). Of the 2,211 recorded anesthesia-related deaths
in the United States during 1999­2005, 46.6% were attribut-
able to overdose of anesthetics; 42.5% were attributable to
adverse effects of anesthetics in therapeutic use; 3.6% were
attributable to complications of anesthesia during preg-
nancy, labor, and puerperium; and 7.3% were attributable to
other complications of anesthesia. Anesthesia complications
were the underlying cause in 241 (10.9%) of the 2,211 deaths.
The estimated rates from anesthesia-related deaths were 1.1
per million population per year (1.45 for males and 0.77 for
females) and 8.2 per million hospital surgical discharges
(11.7 for men and 6.5 for women). The highest death rates
were found in persons aged 85 yr and older.
Conclusion: Each year in the United States, anesthesia/anes-
thetics are reported as the underlying cause in approximately
34 deaths and contributing factors in another 281 deaths, with
excess mortality risk in the elderly and men.
MORTALITY risk associated with anesthesia has been the
subject of extensive research for many decades.1­5 In a
landmark study involving 10 academic medical centers and
599,500 surgical patients in the United States during 1948­
1952, Beecher and Todd6 found that the anesthesia-related
death rate was 64 deaths per 100,000 procedures, varying
markedly by anesthetic agents, types of providers, and
patient characteristics. Based on their study results,
Beecher and Todd estimated that the annual number of
anesthesia-related deaths in the United States was more
than 5,100, or 3.3 deaths per 100,000 population, which
was more than twice the mortality attributable to poliomy-
elitis at that time. The report by Beecher and Todd helped
to identify anesthesia safety as a public health problem and
spawned many follow-up studies in the United States7­10
and other countries.11­14 This intense research effort has
played an important role in the continuing improvement of
anesthesia safety. In the advent of new anesthesia tech-
niques, drugs, and enhanced training, anesthesia mortality
risk has declined from approximately 1 death in 1000
anesthesia procedures in the 1940s to 1 in 10,000 in the
1970s and to 1 in 100,000 in the 1990s and early 2000s.15­18
It is noteworthy that contemporary estimates of anesthe-
sia mortality risk are based on studies conducted in Europe,
Japan, and Australia.17­20 The paucity of anesthesia mortal-
ity studies in the United States in recent years is com-
pounded by several factors. First, improvement in anesthe-
sia safety has made anesthesia-related deaths rare events,
and studying rare events usually requires large sample sizes
and considerable resources. Second, there is not an estab-
lished national surveillance data system for monitoring an-
esthesia mortality. Last, clinical practice of anesthesia has
expanded so much that it is extremely difficult to gather
exposure data. It is estimated that most surgical anesthesia
procedures are now performed in ambulatory care set-
tings.21,22 The use of anesthesia for therapeutic and diag-
nostic purposes is also on the rise.23
After the 1999 publication of the Institute of Medicine's
report on medical error,24 patient safety has become a
priority area of health services research. To facilitate the
measurement of patient safety and the evaluation of inter-
vention programs, the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality developed more than 20 patient safety indicators
for use with routinely collected hospital inpatient dis-
charge data. Each indicator refers to a group of complica-
tions or adverse events identified through specific Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical
Modification codes.25 The first indicator, purportedly mea-
suring the safety of anesthesia, is limited to adverse effects
of anesthetics in therapeutic use and overdose of anesthet-

ics. Complications of anesthesia during labor and delivery
and systemic complications, such as malignant hyperther-
mia due to anesthesia, are not included. The objectives of
this study are to develop a comprehensive set of anesthesia
safety indicators based on the latest version of the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases and to apply these indica-
tors to a national data system for understanding the epide-
miology of anesthesia-related mortality.
Materials and Methods
The study protocol was reviewed and approved for
exemption of informed consent by the Columbia Univer-
sity Institutional Review Board, New York, New York.
ICD-10 Codes
The International Statistical Classification of Diseases
and Related Health Problems (ICD) is the standard
classification system for recording and reporting dis-
eases, injuries, and other health conditions.26 Sponsored
by the World Health Organization, this disease classifica-
tion system is revised periodically and used by many
countries for the compilation of mortality and morbidity
data. It also serves as the basis for international compar-
ison of health statistics. The 10th revision (ICD-10) was
implemented for coding and classifying mortality data
from death certificates in the United States as of January
1, 1999. For the purpose of the current study, we devel-
oped a list of ICD-10 codes for medical conditions re-
lated to anesthesia or anesthetics (table 1). These codes
were identified by screening all the chapters of ICD-10
and informed by a thorough review of the research
literature pertaining to anesthesia mortality and ICD.
In previous studies,6,18 anesthesia-related deaths were
usually divided into two groups based on clinical judgment:
deaths caused primarily by anesthesia and deaths in which
anesthesia played a partial role. In this study, the role
anesthesia played in the death was based on the causal
chain of events leading to death as identified by the order
on the death certificate and ICD coding guidelines. Anes-
thesia-related deaths were operationally defined as deaths
that included one of the anesthesia-related codes (table 1)
as the underlying cause of death or included at least one
anesthesia-related code as a listed cause among the multiple
causes of death. We grouped the identified ICD-10 codes
into four categories: (1) complications of anesthesia during
pregnancy, labor, and puerperium; (2) overdose of anes-
thetics (exclusive of abuse of these substances); (3) adverse
effects of anesthetics in therapeutic use; and (4) other
complications of anesthesia in surgical and medical care
(table 1). In 5% of the anesthesia-related deaths, there was
more than one anesthesia-related ICD-10 code in the multiple
causes. For the purposes of this analysis, the death was cate-
gorized into the first listed ICD-10 code included in table 1.
Data Sources
Mortality data for this study came from the multiple-
cause-of-death data files of the National Vital Statistics Sys-
tem, maintained by the National Center for Health Statis-
tics.# Deaths were limited to those occurring within the
United States. US citizens and military personnel who died
outside of the United States are not included. The mortality
data files are based on death certificates compiled by indi-
vidual states and contain one record for each decedent.
Data collected from the death certificate include informa-
tion about the decedent's demographic characteristics and
causes of death. Up to 20 ICD-10 codes are recorded for
each death. The underlying cause of death is selected from
among all listed causes as the medical condition or the
circumstance that triggered the chain of morbid events
leading directly to death, and a contributing cause is a
medical condition that aggravated the morbid sequence
resulting in the fatality.27
Using the ICD-10 codes listed in table 1 and the multiple-
cause-of-death data files for the years 1999­2005, we iden-
tified anesthesia-related deaths. The records for these anes-
thesia-related deaths served as the mortality data for this study.
Statistical Analysis
Death rates were computed in two ways. First, we cal-
culated the annual rates of anesthesia-related deaths per
million population using data from the US Census Bureau
for the study period. The annualized population-based
death rate is a widely accepted public health measure,
reflecting the portion of the general population that dies of
a given health problem each year. Second, we estimated
the risk of hospital anesthesia-related mortality based on
the number of anesthesia-related deaths that occurred in
hospitals as inpatients as recorded on the death certificate
and national estimates of hospital surgical discharges. Na-
tional estimates of hospital surgical discharges for the study
period were generated from the National Hospital Dis-
charge Survey using the defined surgical procedural
codes28 and were used as a proxy measure of exposure to
anesthesia among hospital inpatients.
Although mortality data are not subject to sampling error,
they may be affected by random variation. Assuming that
deaths follow a Poisson probability distribution, the SE
associated with the number of deaths is the square root of
the number of deaths.29 The National Hospital Discharge
Survey data were based on a multistage random sampling
scheme, and the national estimate of the annual number of
hospital discharges with a surgical procedure had a relative
SE of approximately 4%.28 The SEs were calculated using
SUDAAN release 9.0.1 (Research Triangle Institute, Re-
search Triangle Park, NC).

Results
Frequency Distribution
During the 7-yr study period, there were a total of 2,211
anesthesia-related deaths. Anesthesia complications were
the underlying cause in 241 of these deaths (10.9%) and a
contributing factor in the remaining 1,970 deaths (89.1%).
Overall, 46.6% of the anesthesia-related deaths were due to
overdose of anesthetics; followed by adverse effects of
anesthetics in therapeutic use (42.5%); anesthesia compli-
cations during pregnancy, labor, and puerperium (3.6%);
and other complications of anesthesia (7.3%) (table 2). Of
the 241 deaths with anesthesia/anesthetics as the underly-
ing cause of death, 79.7% resulted from adverse effects of
anesthetics in therapeutic use; 19.1% resulted from anes-

rium; and 1.2% resulted from wrongly placed endotracheal
tubes.
The number of anesthesia-related deaths averaged 315
deaths per year, including 34 deaths caused primarily by
anesthesia/anesthetics (fig. 1).
Males outnumbered females in anesthesia-related
deaths by an 80% margin (1,428 vs. 783). The majority
(54.9%) of the decedents were aged 25­54 yr.
Population-based Death Rate
The anesthesia-related death rate was 1.1 per million
population per year, with the rate for males almost twice
the rate for females (1.45 vs. 0.77). The death rate varied
with age (fig. 2). For both sexes, the lowest rate was
found in children aged 5­14 yr, and the highest rate was
found in those aged 85 yr or older. Males had higher
death rates than females throughout the life span, and
the gap between sexes was especially pronounced in
young and middle-age adults (fig. 2).
Mortality Risk among Surgical Inpatients
There were an estimated 105.7 million surgical dis-
charges from US hospitals during the study period. Of
the 2,211 anesthesia-related deaths, 867 died in hospi-
tals, 348 died in ambulatory care settings as outpatients,
46 died on arrival, 258 died at homes, 44 died in hospice
facilities, 315 died at nursing homes or long-term care
facilities, 327 died in other places, and for 6, the place of
death was unknown. The estimated mortality risk from
anesthesia complications for inpatients was 8.2 (867/
105.7 [95% confidence interval, 7.4­9.0]) deaths per
million hospital surgical discharges (11.7 [95% confi-
dence interval, 10.3­13.1] for men and 6.2 [95% confi-
dence interval 5.5­7.0] for women). The age pattern in
mortality risk generally followed the pattern in popula-
tion-based death rates, with substantially increased risk
in the elderly (fig. 3).
Discussion
Since the first release of the patient safety indicators in
2001, a number of studies have assessed the utility of the
individual indicators and in different patient groups.30­34
As a screening tool for identifying potential patient safety
problems at the hospital level, patient safety indicators
are found to be clinically relevant, effective, and effi-
cient. None of these studies, however, has specifically

evaluated the indicator measuring anesthesia safety. As
part of our effort to close this research gap, we devel-
oped four anesthesia safety indicators based on the latest
version of the ICD. These indicators measure more com-
plications and adverse events of anesthesia/anesthetics
than the one proposed by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality25 and can be used to address the
mortality risk. Specifically, we have added a category of
complications of obstetric anesthesia, and a category of
systemic complications that are rare occurrences but are
of special concern to anesthesiologists, such as shock
due to anesthesia, malignant hyperthermia due to anes-
thesia, and failed or difficult intubation. The US Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services has proposed to
Congress to adopt a clinical modification of the ICD-10
codes in reporting clinical diagnoses and procedures by
October 2011.** The anesthesia safety indicators devel-
oped in this study need to be validated when ICD-10
Clinical Modification­coded health care utilization data
become available.
Other researchers have used ICD-9 codes in studies of
anesthesia morbidity and mortality.35,36 Our application
of the anesthesia safety indicators to the ICD-10­coded
multiple-cause-of-death data files produced several nota-
ble findings. First, our results indicate that the numbers
of anesthesia-related deaths in the United States averaged
approximately 315 deaths per year from 1999 to 2005.
Approximately 11% of these deaths were caused primar-
ily by anesthesia/anesthetics. This proportion is consis-
tent with previous studies.17,37,38 The death rate from
complications and adverse events associated with anes-
thesia/anesthetics during the study period was estimated
at 1.1 per million population, which represents a 97%
reduction compared with the reported rate for the years
1948­1952.6 Based on the number of anesthesia-related
deaths occurring in hospitals and hospital surgical dis-
charges, we estimated that the mortality risk of anesthe-
sia for surgical inpatients was 0.82 in 100,000. The risk
of anesthesia-related deaths estimated with this method-
ology is compatible with recent reports from other coun-
tries.17,18,20 For example, in Australia, where there is a
national registry for anesthesia-related deaths, the mor-
tality risk is estimated to be 0.5 per 100,000.18
Our findings should be interpreted with caution. First,
the anesthesia safety indicators developed in this study
are based on a limited number of ICD-10 codes, which
capture only the death certificates in which an anesthe-
sia complication or adverse event was listed among the
multiple causes of death. This limitation can be aggra-
vated when the indicators are applied to hospital dis-
charge data to study anesthesia-related morbidity, be-
cause clinical documentation of complications may vary
with hospitals and the severity of complications.
Second, our data on anesthesia-related mortality came
solely from the multiple-cause-of-death data files of the
National Vital Statistics System. As the most authoritative
source of national mortality data in the United States, the
multiple-cause-of-death data files are known for their
completeness of data ascertainment; uniformity in for-
mat and content; and standardized protocols for report-
ing, coding, and processing.39 To reduce coding errors,
the National Center for Health Statistics uses automated
coding systems in combination with manual checking.
In the past decade, the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics implemented a series of interventional programs
(e.g., clearer instructions for data reporting and process-
ing, more timely filing of amendments, electronic death
registration, querying the states about specific data
items).39 Nevertheless, the validity and reliability of the
multiple-cause-of-death data remain a concern. Although

ANESTHESIA MORTALITY
Anesthesiology, V 110, No 4, Apr 2009
previous research has shown a high reliability of the
multiple-cause-of-death data for some diseases (such as
cancer and external causes),40 their sensitivity and spec-
ificity for detecting anesthesia-related deaths have not
been rigorously examined. It is likely that the case defi-
nition we used in this study may have missed a portion
of anesthesia-related mortality, particularly those deaths
in which complications and adverse events of anesthe-
sia/anesthetics played only a contributory role. On the
other hand, some of the deaths associated with anesthet-
ics or analgesics identified through the ICD-10 codes
may not be related to anesthesia practice.
Finally, we based our estimates of death rates on pop-
ulation data and mortality risk on hospital surgical dis-
charges. The population-based rates are valuable from a
public health perspective but should be further refined
in future studies. Specifically, deaths from complications
of anesthesia during pregnancy, labor, and puerperium
are confined to women of reproductive age; therefore,
the mortality risk should be estimated using age- and
sex-appropriate denominator data.
Our estimate of anesthesia-related mortality risk for
surgical inpatients is also susceptible to biases. It is
conceivable that some of the anesthesia-related deaths
occurring in hospitals might have resulted from expo-
sure in ambulatory care settings or from exposure in
nonsurgical therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. In
addition, it is possible that some deaths that occurred
outside of hospitals may have been related to complica-
tions from inpatient anesthesia. After a 10-yr hiatus, the
National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery from the National
Center for Health Statistics was fielded in 2006 with
updates to reflect the changing environment in ambula-
tory surgery. The lack of a comprehensive data system
monitoring anesthesia exposure is a problem that has
hindered research efforts in the United States and other
countries for many years. With the rapid growth of
clinical anesthesia services, considering methods for on-
going national surveillance for anesthesia exposure and
outcomes is imperative.
The results of our study suggest that the United States
has experienced a 97% decrease in anesthesia-related
death rates since the late 1940s and the mortality risk
from complications and adverse events of anesthesia/
anesthetics for surgical inpatients is similar to the reports
from other countries, at approximately 1 in 100,000. Our
study found that 42.5% of anesthesia-related deaths were
attributable to adverse effects of anesthetics in therapeu-
tic use. With the increased use of anesthesia outside of
the traditional operating room setting,21,22 continued
monitoring of the safety of anesthesia is warranted.
