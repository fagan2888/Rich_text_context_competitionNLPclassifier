Using data compiled by the United States Sentencing Commission, we examine
the independent and joint effects of race/ethnicity, gender, and age on sentenc-
ing decisions in U.S. federal courts. We find that Hispanics and blacks, males,
and younger defendants receive harsher sentences than whites, females, and
older defendants after controlling for important legal and contextual factors.
When these effects are examined in combination, young Hispanic male defen-
dants have the highest odds of incarceration and young black male defendants
receive the longest sentences. The findings show considerable variation in the
sentencing outcomes of defendants depending on their relative social-structural
position in society, and that particularly harsh punishments are focused dispro-
portionately on the youngest Hispanic and black male defendants. Our results
reinforce the idea that researchers need to consider the combined impact of
multiple defendant statuses on sentencing outcomes because joint effects are
considerably larger than the effects of any one defendant characteristic.

Introduction
Although blacks and Hispanics are numerical minorities within U.S. society, as
defendants in the criminal courts and inmates in prisons, they are often majori-
ties and almost always overrepresented (Rossi & Berk, 1997). This dispropor-
tionate representation of racial and ethnic minorities remains a source of
major concern, largely because it suggests the possibility of discrimination in
the criminal justice system (Blumstein, 1982). Given the value we place on
equal treatment under the law (Sampson & Lauritsen, 1997) and our increasing
understanding of the potentially deleterious effects of incarceration on family
formation (Lopoo & Western, 2005; Western & McLanahan, 2000), community
organization (Clear, 2002; Clear, Rose, Waring, & Scully, 2003), and participa-
tion in a representative democracy (Uggen & Manza, 2002), it is critical that
the overrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in the criminal justice system
not be further exacerbated by legal decision-making that unfairly disadvan-
tages racial and ethnic minorities vis-à-vis other racial-ethnic groups.
Over the last three decades, state and federal legislatures have enacted
sentencing guidelines designed to reduce the discretion of legal agents in order
to assure that persons with comparable criminal records convicted of the same
criminal charges receive similar sentences under the law (Tonry, 1996). Central
to these guidelines is the notion that defendant characteristics such as race and
ethnicity are considered extralegal factors that should not be considered at the
sentencing stage. However, even with sentencing guidelines in place, extralegal
disparities appear not to have been eliminated (Everett & Wojtkiewicz, 2002).
Although a great deal of research has examined the impact of race and gender
on sentencing outcomes (see, for a review, Chiricos & Crawford, 1995; Daly &
Bordt, 1995; Spohn 2000), fewer studies focus on the influence of ethnicity (e.g.,
Albonetti, 1998; Demuth & Steffensmeier, 2004; Everett & Wojtkiewicz, 2002;
Steffensmeier & Demuth, 2000) and age (e.g., Champion, 1987; Steffensmeier &
Motivans, 2000) at the sentencing stage. Furthermore, only recently have
researchers empirically examined the possible joint effects of multiple status
characteristics on court decisions (e.g., Spohn & Holleran, 2000; Steffensmeier,
Ulmer, & Kramer, 1998).
In the present study, we use data compiled by the United States Sentencing
Commission (USSC) to examine the independent and joint effects of race/ethnic-
ity, gender, and age on incarceration and sentence length decisions in U.S.
federal courts. In particular, we focus on the treatment of Hispanic defendants
relative to black and white defendants. Considering that Hispanics (of all races)
now comprise the largest racial-ethnic minority group in the USA (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2000), there is a relative paucity of sentencing research that examines
the outcomes of Hispanic defendants, especially when compared to the sizeable
literature on black­white differences. On theoretical grounds, there are reasons
to believe that Hispanic defendants may be treated more harshly than white and
even black defendants at the sentencing stage. Hispanics face many of the same
social and structural disadvantages as blacks (e.g., poverty, unemployment,
SENTENCING IN U.S. FEDERAL COURTS 3
crime, discrimination) as well as additional burdens, such as language barriers
and concerns surrounding citizenship and cultural values, which might have
implications for their treatment at sentencing (Mata, 1998; Oboler, 1995).
The federal sentencing data are ideally suited for such an analysis because:
(1) they contain more detailed legal, extralegal, and contextual information
than is often available in state court data sets enabling a more robust test of the
existence of extralegal disparities, (2) the large data set provides sufficient
numbers of cases to perform a rigorous analysis of all defendant subgroups--in
particular, the data include a large number of Hispanic and female defendants
who are often excluded because of small sample sizes, and also (3) prior studies
examining the joint effects of defendant characteristics on sentencing outcomes
(Spohn & Holleran, 2000; Steffensmeier et al., 1998) have focused on state
courts (e.g., Pennsylvania) where sentencing guidelines may be more flexible
than in federal courts and judges may not be as insulated from community and
political forces as their federal counterparts (see discussion in Steffensmeier &
Demuth, 2001). The analysis of multiple, combined extralegal disparities in the
federal courts undertaken in the present study provides insight into the potential
influence of multiple defendant characteristics on sentencing outcomes under a
relatively more restrictive guideline system than has been previously examined.
Prior Research
There is a substantial amount of variability in sentences given to convicted
offenders. Prior research demonstrates that differences in legally relevant case
characteristics such as offense severity, criminal history, multiple charges, and
mode of conviction (i.e., guilty plea versus trial) account for the bulk of this
sentencing variation (Gottfredson & Gottfredson, 1990; Spohn, 2002). Further-
more, jurisdictional differences in the law, as well as differences in the structural
organization and cultural norms of courtroom communities and workgroups,
contribute to some of the variation in sentencing outcomes across similarly
situated cases (Dixon, 1995; Ulmer, 1997). Nonetheless, even after taking into
account these legal and contextual factors, there is evidence that sentencing
decisions are also influenced by extralegal factors, including the defendant's
race/ethnicity, gender, and age (Spohn, 2002).
Race/Ethnicity Effects
The primary focus of past sentencing disparity research has been on differences
in the outcomes of black and white defendants. In a review of past race and
(state court) sentencing studies, Chiricos and Crawford (1995) concluded "race
is a consistent and frequently significant disadvantage for blacks when in/out
decisions are concerned" (p. 297). They report no consistent black disadvantage
regarding sentence length decisions. More recent studies of black­white
4 DOERNER AND DEMUTH
sentencing differences in state and federal courts also find that black defen-
dants tend to receive harsher sentences than similarly situated white defen-
dants (Albonetti, 1997; Demuth & Steffensmeier, 2004; Mitchell, 2005;
Steffensmeier & Demuth, 2000, 2001; Steffensmeier et al., 1998). However, it is
important to note that there are some studies that find no main effects of race
(e.g., Engen & Gainey, 2000; Miethe & Moore, 1986).
Unfortunately, we know much less about how Hispanic ethnicity influences
criminal justice decision-making. Steffensmeier and Demuth (2000) show that
white defendants are least likely to be incarcerated in federal court, and they
receive shorter sentences than black and especially Hispanic defendants, partic-
ularly in drug cases. Albonetti (1997) also finds that Hispanic and black defendants
convicted of federal drug crimes receive more severe sentences than white defen-
dants and that Hispanic and black defendants benefit less from guideline depar-
tures than white defendants. Everett and Wojtkiewicz (2002) also show that
Hispanic and black defendants receive more severe sentences than white defen-
dants in the federal courts after controlling for legally relevant factors.
Gender Effects
A fairly persistent finding in the sentencing literature is that female defendants
are treated more leniently than male defendants (Bickle & Peterson, 1991; Daly
& Bordt, 1995; Spohn, 2000, 2002; Steffensmeier, Kramer, & Streifel, 1993);
however, there are some researchers who report no differences (Kruttschnitt &
Green, 1984). Spohn (2002) shows that the odds of receiving a prison sentence
are 2.5 times greater for male offenders than for female offenders after
controlling for legally relevant factors. Research on sentencing in Pennsylvania
courts by Steffensmeier and colleagues (1993, 2000) indicates that gender, net
of other factors, has an effect on sentencing outcomes with female defendants
sentenced less harshly than male defendants. Similarly, Griffin and Wooldredge
(2006) find that women are sentenced more leniently than men in Ohio courts
both before and after recent sentencing reforms (see also Koons-Witt, 2002).
Age Effects
Many prior sentencing studies statistically control for the age of the defendant,
but few actually make age the focus of their analyses (see, for an exception,
Champion, 1987; Steffensmeier, Kramer, & Ulmer, 1995; Steffensmeier &
Motivans, 2000). Overall, the findings suggest that older offenders are
sentenced more leniently than younger offenders. For instance, Steffensmeier
et al. (1995) find that in Pennsylvania courts older offenders are somewhat less
likely to be imprisoned than younger offenders and if imprisoned they receive
shorter sentence lengths. Yet, because offenders under the age of 21 also
receive some leniency in sentence outcomes in relation to offenders in their
SENTENCING IN U.S. FEDERAL COURTS 5
mid-20s, the age-sentencing relationship may not be strictly linear, but curvilin-
ear. They conclude that the peak ages for sentencing severity are 21­27. After
this period, severity declines gradually with advancing age (see also Steffens-
meier & Demuth, 2000).
The Joint Effects of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Age
Zatz (1987) argues that the nature of racial and ethnic biases in sentencing has
changed over time. As a society that is now more sensitive socially and legally to
the equal treatment of different racial/ethnic groups, it is much less likely that
large, uniform differences in the treatment of minority groups in the courts will
emerge today than in the past. Instead, biases will emerge in more subtle and indi-
rect ways, some that are detectable as main or direct effects, but others that are
only visible through indirect or interaction effects of race/ethnicity with other
factors or at certain stages of the criminal justice system (Zatz, 2000; see also
for a discussion of the conceptualization of race and ethnicity in studies of crime
and criminal justice, Zatz & Rodriquez, 2006). For instance, Provine (2006)
discusses the disparate racial impact that may be embedded in our laws (e.g., the
different punishments for crack and powder cocaine). And, Demuth (2003) notes
that while racial/ethnic differences in pretrial detention may not necessarily be
caused by racial bias (although there is evidence of this, as well), de facto racial/
ethnic differences may emerge nonetheless due to associated socioeconomic
differences. These disadvantages faced at the pretrial release stage may carry
forward to later stages in the case process (Foote, 1954; Goldkamp, 1979).
Another way in which race/ethnicity may act to more subtly affect legal
outcomes is the focus of the present study: the joint impact of race/ethnicity
with other status characteristics. Among the small number of studies that exam-
ine the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender or the intersection of race/
ethnicity, gender, and age on sentencing outcomes, there is evidence that joint
effects are often considerably larger than individual main effects and that they
also reveal extralegal disparities that are otherwise hidden when examining only
additive models (Spohn & Holleran, 2000; Steffensmeier et al., 1998).
Spohn, Welch, and Gruhl (1985) find that black women are sentenced more
leniently than black men, but receive sentences that are comparable to those of
white men. However, there were an insufficient number of white females in
their analysis to allow for a comparison of white males and white females. Stef-
fensmeier and Demuth (2006) report the existence of important interactive
effects of gender and race/ethnicity in the sentencing of criminal defendants in
large urban state courts. They find that racial/ethnic differences exist for men,
but not for women. Their findings do not support the traditional view that
chivalry or leniency in court sanctioning typically bypasses `women of color'
(Belknap, 1996; Klein & Kress, 1976).
Steffensmeier et al. (1998) examine the main and interactive effects of race
(black vs. white), gender, and age on sentencing outcomes in Pennsylvania
6 DOERNER AND DEMUTH
courts. In addition to finding statistically significant main effects of race,
gender, and age, they also report several notable extralegal interaction effects.
For instance, within-sex comparisons show that the effect of race is stronger for
male defendants than for female defendants--i.e., black males are sentenced
more harshly than white males, but black females are sentenced only slightly
more harshly than white females. Also, age has a greater effect on the sentenc-
ing of males than females. And, race and gender differences are smaller among
older defendants and greater among younger defendants. Most importantly,
young black males are sentenced considerably more harshly than any other
defendant group.
Spohn and Holleran (2000) extend the research done by Steffensmeier et al.
(1998) by looking at the effects of race/ethnicity, age, gender, and employment
status on sentence outcomes in state courts in Chicago, Miami, and Kansas City.
A general pattern emerges whereby defendants who are male, black or
Hispanic, aged 21­29, and unemployed are more likely to be incarcerated. Nota-
bly, the four defendant characteristics interact to produce harsher sentences
for certain offenders. Overall, their results are consistent with the findings of
Steffensmeier et al. (1998), but they note that there are `constellations of char-
acteristics' other than `young black male' such as Hispanic and unemployed that
need to be examined because they may receive especially harsh treatment in
the criminal justice system.
Theoretical Framework and Research Expectations
Legal decision-making is complex, repetitive, and frequently constrained by
time and resources in ways that may produce considerable ambiguity or uncer-
tainty for arriving at a fully informed decision (Albonetti, 1991; Farrell &
Holmes, 1991). To reduce uncertainty, decision-makers may rely not only on the
defendant's present offense and prior criminal conduct, but also on attributions
linked to the defendant's race, gender, age, or other social positions (Steffens-
meier et al. 1998; Ulmer, 1997). Although sentencing guidelines are designed to
limit the impact of these extralegal factors on sentencing outcomes through the
use of sentencing grids, there remains considerable room for extralegal factors
to influence sentencing decisions within the cells of the sentencing grid as well
as through the use of departures from the guidelines (Steffensmeier & Demuth,
2000).
The focal concerns perspective developed by Steffensmeier and colleagues
(1993, 1998) provides a useful framework for understanding why extralegal
factors such as race/ethnicity, gender, and age might continue to influence
sentencing decisions despite the implementation of formal guideline systems.
They outline three focal concerns that are important to judges and other crimi-
nal justice actors in reaching sentencing decisions: blameworthiness, protection
of the community, and practical constraints and consequences. Steffensmeier
and colleagues argue that defendant status characteristics may influence
SENTENCING IN U.S. FEDERAL COURTS 7
sentencing decisions insofar as stereotypes and behavioral expectations linked
to these characteristics relate to the focal concerns of legal agents.
Blameworthiness follows the principle that sentences should depend on the
offender's culpability and the degree of injury caused. Women are believed to
be less dangerous, less blameworthy, less likely to recidivate, and more likely to
be deterred than men (Spohn, 2002). Other previous research (Albonetti, 1991;
Farrell & Swigert, 1978; Miethe & Moore, 1985; Zatz, 1984) has linked defen-
dant's race/ethnicity to notions of dangerousness and recidivism.
Protection of the community typically focuses on the need to incapacitate
the offender or to deter future crime. In recent years, the public's fear of crime
and especially the crime of young minority men has increased (Anderson, 1995).
Young black males in the U.S. are often portrayed in the mass media as hostile,
brutal, aggressive, and violent (Majors & Gordon, 1994), and also as deviant,
dangerous, and dysfunctional (Gibbs, 1988). Hispanic offenders evoke similar
attributions (Anderson, 1995). In addition, because of the context of Hispanic
immigration in the U.S., Hispanic defendants may seem even more culturally
dissimilar and unpredictable than their black counterparts (Steffensmeier &
Demuth, 2000).
Practical constraints and consequences relate to how sentencing decisions
impact the functioning of the criminal justice system as well as the circumstances
of individual defendants and their families and communities. Young offenders,
especially those who are racial minorities, are less likely to be seen as being
harmed by a prison term (Kramer & Steffensmeier, 1993; Steffensmeier, et al.
1998). In addition, the court's concern with breaking up families and protecting
the innocent may more often apply to women than men (Daly, 1987).
Guided by the focal concerns framework and the findings of past research on
stereotypes and sentencing outcomes, we expect to find independent effects of
race/ethnicity, gender, and age on sentencing outcomes, as well as larger joint
effects based on multiple defendant characteristics. For example, we expect
that defendants who are young, male, black, or Hispanic will receive harsher
sentences than those defendants who are older, female, or white. Moreover, we
expect that defendants who are young, black or Hispanic, and male will receive
sentencing outcomes that are disproportionately severe vis-à-vis other racial/
ethnic-gender-age subgroups.
Data and Methods
In the present study, we use data from the 2001 Monitoring of Federal Criminal
Sentences compiled by the USSC. The data include all cases received by the USSC
that had sentencing dates between 1 October 2000 and 30 September 2001 and
were assessed as constitutional (N = 59,897). These data are especially appropri-
ate for this study as they contain some of the richest and most detailed informa-
tion available on the processing of cases at the sentencing stage. Indeed, many
state-level data sets used in prior studies lack the large number of legal control
8 DOERNER AND DEMUTH
variables found in the federal guidelines data that enable us to more adequately
rule out alternative explanations for extralegal effects on sentencing outcomes
(e.g., Demuth & Steffensmeier, 2004; Spohn & Holleran, 2000). Furthermore, the
rigidity (i.e., it is more formal and allows for less judicial discretion) of the
federal guidelines vis-à-vis many state guidelines provide a more conservative
test of the impact of extralegal factors on sentencing outcomes.
For this analysis, we eliminate several defendant groups from the sample.
First, noncitizens are deleted from the analysis (approximately 33% of the
sample). The federal cases of noncitizens often differ from those of citizens in
substantial ways that make comparisons of sentencing outcomes between them
difficult (Demuth, 2002). For example, a large percentage of noncitizen cases
involve immigration offenses that cannot be directly compared to citizen cases.
Furthermore, because noncitizens can be deported, the sentencing process for
noncitizens is often qualitatively different (e.g., its goal is not punishment, per
se, but rather to expel the defendant from the country) from that of U.S. citi-
zens. And, case information provided for noncitizens may be incomplete result-
ing in an underestimation of prior criminal history. Most importantly,
noncitizens in the data set are overwhelmingly of Hispanic origin. Because the
focus of our study is on the treatment of race and ethnicity in the sentencing
process, we do not want to conflate the effects of ethnicity with the effects of
citizenship status.
Second, defendants under the age of 18 are excluded from the analysis
because their cases are substantively and legally different due to their juvenile
status. Third, defendants who indicate their race/ethnicity as `other' are
deleted from the analysis. This is done to better focus the present analysis on
white, black, and Hispanic subgroups. Those claiming `other' as their race/
ethnicity make up approximately 4% of the defendant sample. Fourth, using
listwise deletion, all cases with missing information for any variable used in the
analysis are deleted. The number of missing values is small and the exclusion of
these cases from the analysis does not significantly change the findings. The
size of the analytical sample used in the present study is 33,505.
Dependent Variables
Sentencing outcomes are the result of a two-stage decision-making process: the
decision to incarcerate and, if incarcerated, the sentence length decision (see, for
discussion, Spohn, 2002). In the present study, we use logistic regression to model
the incarceration (in/out) decision. The in/out decision variable is coded dichot-
omously, with 1 indicating those defendants who receive a prison sentence and 0
indicating those who receive a non-incarceration sentence (e.g., probation). The
sentence length decision is modeled using OLS regression and includes only those
defendantswhoreceiveaprisonsentence.Sentencelengthisacontinuousvariable
representing the logged length of the prison sentence in months. Logging sentence
length helps to normalize the distribution and taking the antilog of the coefficient
SENTENCING IN U.S. FEDERAL COURTS 9
in the logged sentence length model provides a useful proportional interpretation.
Sentence length is capped at 470 months and is considered life in prison.1
Extralegal Variables
The extralegal variables of interest in the present study are race/ethnicity,
gender, and age. Race/ethnicity is coded as three dummy variables: white non-
Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic of any race. The information provided
about the race/ethnicity of the defendant comes from the Presentencing Report
(PSR) generated by the defendant's probation officer. Defendant gender is a
dummy variable coded 1 if the defendant is female and 0 if the defendant is male.
Defendant age is coded consistent with Steffensmeier et al. (1998) as a series of
dummy variables with age ranges of 18­20, 21­29, 30­39, 40­49, 50­59, and 60
and over. The reference groups used for much of the analysis are white, male,
and 18- to 20-year-old defendants.
Legal Variables
The federal sentencing data include a number of important legal measures that
account for much of the variation in sentencing outcomes across cases. The
federal courts operate under a guidelines system in which judges sentence
defendants according to prescribed ranges but also may depart from the
suggested guidelines range (Steffensmeier & Demuth, 2000). Sentence ranges
are determined using a grid that takes into account the severity of the current
offense on one axis and the defendant's criminal history on the other. In turn,
most prior federal sentencing studies include separate variables for criminal
history and offense severity in their regression analyses (e.g., Albonetti, 1997;
Steffensmeier & Demuth, 2000).
However, Engen and Gainey (2000) argue that a more appropriate strategy for
modeling the effects of criminal history and offense severity on sentencing
1. Many sentencing studies model the sentence length decision including a correction term for
selection bias stemming from the decision to incarcerate (Berk, 1983). This involves controlling for
the "hazard" of incarceration (estimated in the in/out model) in the sentence length model. The
hazard variable represents for each observation the instantaneous probability of being excluded
from the sample conditional upon being in the pool at risk. However, Stolzenberg and Relles (1997)
and Bushway, Johnson, and Slocum (2007) find that this correction term can often introduce more
bias into the sentence length model than it eliminates due to high levels of collinearity between the
correction term and other predictors of sentence length. This is especially likely when the predic-
tors of incarceration are very similar to the predictors of sentence length as in the present study.
The highest correlation we uncovered was between the correction term and the measure of
presumptive guideline sentence length (r = 0.6). Also, Stolzenberg and Relles (1997) argue that a
correction term is often unnecessary when there is a low level of selection. In the current data,
because only 19% of defendants avoid incarceration, it is unlikely that a selection bias will strongly
influence the sentence length findings. For these reasons, we do not include a correction term for
selection bias in the sentence length model.
10 DOERNER AND DEMUTH
outcomes is to instead include a variable representing the presumptive guideline
sentence (i.e., the expected sentence prior to any modifications). In essence,
the presumptive sentence represents the combined effects of criminal history
and offense severity in a single measure. Furthermore, Engen and Gainey (2000)
show that the presumptive sentence measure actually explains more of the vari-
ation in sentencing outcomes than the sum of the two separate measures. This
analytic strategy is also used by the USSC (2004). In the present study, we
include a variable representing the guideline minimum sentence, in months. We
also include a measure of criminal history using a variable that ranges from 1 to
6 and indicates the final criminal history score of the defendant. According to
Ulmer (2000), in a rejoinder to Engen and Gainey, measures of offense severity
and prior record have important main, curvilinear, and interactive influences on
in/out and length that cannot be reduced to the effect of presumptive sentence
measures. This suggests that it is statistically and substantively important to
include offense severity and prior record even if one is including a presumptive
sentence measure. However, Ulmer also points out that including all three
legally prescribed variables results in problematic multicollinearity in the OLS
models of sentence length. As a result, an offense severity score variable is not
included in the analysis because it is highly collinear with the guideline minimum
sentence variable.
The federal sentencing statute includes provisions that permit judges to
depart from the sentence prescribed by the guidelines.2 The dilemma for agents
of social control concerns the balance between the principle of uniformity that
demands that offenders committing similar crimes receive similar sentences
(i.e., formal rational law) and individualized justice that tailors sanctions to the
particular characteristics and circumstances of individual offenders (i.e.,
substantive rational law) (Savelsberg, 1992; Weber, 1968). Departure sentences
constitute approximately 35% of all sentences. Downward departures initiated
by judges make up about 37% of all departure cases and substantial assistance
(SA) downward departures, which are initiated by prosecutors in cases where
defendants provide assistance to the government, comprise about 63% of all
departure cases. SA departures reflect a unique combination of judicial and
prosecutorial discretion that is less constrained by the Sentencing Commission
guidelines than regular downward departures. The number of cases involving an
upward departure total only 0.6% of the overall sample (N = 213), and are
deleted from the sample. As a result, defendant's departure status is coded as a
series of dummy variables for no departure (reference group), regular down-
ward departure, and SA downward departure.
2. There is some disagreement among researchers about how to account for departures in the
modeling of sentencing outcomes (see Steffensmeier & Demuth, 2000). For example, are departures
a simultaneous part of the sentencing decision, a selection process, or simply a predictor of
sentences? It has become common practice to treat departures as a predictor and this practice is
supported by the USSC in their study on 15 years of sentencing guidelines (2004). Resolving this issue
is beyond the scope of the present study, but it is noteworthy that controlling for departure status is
likely to produce conservative estimates of extralegal disparities.
SENTENCING IN U.S. FEDERAL COURTS 11
Case disposition is a dichotomous variable, which indicates whether the
offender's case is settled by plea agreement or trial. It is coded 0 for guilty plea
and 1 for trial. We also include a measure of multiple counts. A dummy variable
is coded 0 for cases involving a single count and 1 for cases that involve multiple
counts. And, prior research suggests that a small portion of the variation in
sentencing outcomes is explained by court context (Kautt, 2002; Ulmer &
Johnson, 2004). An examination of jurisdictional differences is important, but
beyond the scope of the present study. Nonetheless, we include controls for judi-
cial district (see also, Albonetti, 1997). A series of dummy variables representing
judicial districts are included in the models, but are not shown in the tables.
Results
In the first stage of our analysis, we examine the independent effects of race/
ethnicity, gender, and age on incarceration and sentence length outcomes
after controlling for important legal factors and differences across judicial
districts. Second, we investigate whether the effects of race/ethnicity, gender,
and age on sentencing outcomes are similar or different across racial/ethnic
and gender groups. Third, we examine the joint effects of race/ethnicity and
age (e.g., 18­20-year-old black defendants) on sentencing outcomes separately
for male and female defendants. Finally, we compare and contrast the
sentence outcomes of specific race/ethnic-gender-age-specific defendant
subgroups.
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 presents the percentages and means of all variables used in the
analyses. The descriptive statistics are partitioned by race/ethnicity and
gender.
Among male defendants, blacks (91%) and Hispanics (89%) are more likely to
receive imprisonment than whites (78%). For females, Hispanic (69%) defendants
are more likely to receive incarceration sentences than black (59%) and white
(62%) defendants. Of those incarcerated, black defendants receive the longest
sentence lengths for their respective gender groups (91 and 36 months for males
and females, respectively). The racial/ethnic sentence length gap is much
smaller for females than males; white and Hispanic females receive average
sentences only 4­5 months shorter than black females, but white and Hispanic
males receive average sentences that are 30­35 months shorter than black
males.
The greater punishment of black and Hispanic defendants compared to white
defendants may be explained by differences in legally relevant factors between
the groups. Black defendants, and black men in particular, tend to have the
most extensive criminal histories, the longest presumptive sentences (although

this does not hold for black women), and are the group least likely to receive
downward departures. Hispanic defendants more closely resemble white defen-
dants on these legal factors, although Hispanics have longer average presump-
tive sentences than whites. In addition, Hispanics, both male and female, are
most apt to receive downward departures, while they are the least likely to
receive SA departures.
Independent Effects of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Age
Table 2 shows the main effects of race/ethnicity, gender, and age on in/out and
sentence length outcomes controlling for important legal factors and judicial
district. Notably, prior criminal history and guideline minimum are strongly
associated with sentencing outcomes and prove to be important statistical
controls (standardized coefficients are available from the authors upon
request). Defendants with more extensive criminal histories, more serious
offense conduct, and conviction at trial are more likely to receive harsher

sentences than those with less extensive criminal histories, single convictions,
or those who plead guilty.
Looking at the effects of race/ethnicity, gender, and age on the incarcera-
tion decision, Hispanic defendants are the racial/ethnic group most likely to
receive an incarceration sentence. The odds of incarceration are about 33%
higher for Hispanic defendants than for white defendants. Female defendants
are significantly less likely to receive incarceration sentences than male defen-
dants. The odds of incarceration for female defendants are approximately 42%
lower than the odds of incarceration for male defendants. Turning to age
effects, the youngest defendants are the most likely to receive prison
sentences. The odds of incarceration among defendants ages 60 and over are
about 40% lower than those among defendants ages 18­20.
Turning to the sentence length decision, black and Hispanic defendants
receive sentences that are about 5% (exp[b]) longer than white defendants.
Female defendants receive sentence lengths that are about 25% shorter than
male defendants. Consistent with the age-in/out relationship, sentence length
decreases with age. Defendants ages 60 and over receive sentences that are
approximately 16% shorter than defendants ages 18­20.3
Effects of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Age by Race/Ethnicity
and Gender
Table 3 shows the effects of race/ethnicity, gender, and age on in/out and
sentence length outcomes in models partitioned be race/ethnicity and gender.
We first examine the effects of race/ethnicity by gender (right side of the
table). Among men, Hispanic and black defendants are more likely to receive an
incarceration sentence (odds ratios of 1.49 and 1.16, respectively) than white
defendants. However, among women, there are no racial/ethnic differences in
the likelihood of incarceration. A similar pattern emerges for sentence length
outcomes. While black and Hispanic men receive longer sentences than their
white male peers (about 7.5% and 5% longer, respectively), there are no statisti-
cally significant racial/ethnic differences in sentence length among women.
However, it is notable that similar to men, Hispanic women receive sentences
3. We also examined whether race/ethnicity, gender, and age effects were offense-specific. It was
difficult (if not impossible) to undertake our full analysis for many of the specific offense types
because of the small sample sizes for many of the race-gender-age-specific subgroups. Nonetheless,
we explored the data for some general patterns especially in light of prior studies that sometimes
find that race effects are larger in drug cases than in nondrug cases. There were an insufficient
number of cases to fully explore the analysis of joint effects even for such a broad category as
"drugs." However, we did examine the main effects of race/ethnicity, gender, and age and found
some differences between drug and nondrug cases. Although the gender and age effects were not
considerably different, the race/ethnicity effects were somewhat larger in drug cases than in
nondrug cases (but, the race effects remained in nondrug cases). It is important that future studies
explore the specific locations of extralegal disparity in the federal courts. But, to fully examine
offense-specific differences is beyond the scope of this study.
SENTENCING IN U.S. FEDERAL COURTS 15
that are about 5% longer than white women. This finding is not statistically
significant due, in part, to the reduced power of the model, but helps to explain
the similar sizes of the white and Hispanic gender gaps in the race/ethnicity-
specific sentence length results discussed next.
To provide an alternative perspective, we also examine the effect of gender
in models partitioned by race/ethnicity (left side of the table). We find that the
gender gap for incarceration decisions is the largest (and similar) for black and
Hispanic defendants and the smallest for white defendants. For black and
Hispanic defendants, the odds of receiving an incarceration sentence (for both
groups) are about 50% lower for women than they are for men; for whites, the

odds are about 32% lower for women than men. Regarding sentence length
outcomes, the gender gap is largest for black defendants (i.e., women's
sentences are 36% shorter than men's) and smallest for Hispanic (17%) and white
defendants (20%).
Next, we examine the effect of age on sentencing outcomes by race/ethnic-
ity and by gender. Looking first at the effect of age on sentencing outcomes by
gender (right side of the table), there are few age differences among female
defendants for either in/out or sentence length outcomes. The only statistically
significant difference is the lower likelihood of incarceration (odds ratio = 0.37)
among women ages 60 and over compared to the youngest defendants. For men,
the pattern of age differences in the likelihood of incarceration is similar to that
of women; only the oldest male defendants have a lower odds (odds ratio =
0.66) of receiving a prison sentence. But, age differences in sentence length
among men are larger than among women and punishment is more concentrated
among younger defendants. For instance, male defendants ages 60 and over
receive sentences about 17% shorter than the youngest male defendants.
Turning to the effect of age on incarceration (in/out) outcomes across racial/
ethnic groups (left side of the table), the age pattern for white and black defen-
dants is very similar. Results indicate that only the oldest defendants are
treated more leniently; whites 60 and over and blacks 50 and over are treated
more leniently than their younger counterparts. However, among Hispanics a
different pattern emerges. Not only do the odds of incarceration for Hispanic
defendants decline at a younger age (40 years old), but the likelihood of incar-
ceration also drops off more precipitously. Hispanic defendants ages 40 and
over already have incarceration odds that are about 40% lower than those of
Hispanic defendants 18­20 years old.
Looking at sentence length, white and Hispanic defendants more closely
resemble each other. There are few statistically significant age differences,
although there does appear to be somewhat of an inverted-U shape to the age-
sentence length profiles of white and Hispanic defendants. Except for the oldest
defendants, white and Hispanic defendants ages 18­20 (i.e., the youngest
defendants) receive the shortest sentences, net of controls. Among black defen-
dants, harsher sentences are heavily concentrated among the youngest defen-
dants with sentences dropping off sharply with increasing age. The oldest black
defendants receive sentences that are about 23% shorter than the youngest
black defendants; for whites and Hispanics, the `youngest­oldest' sentence
length gaps are considerably smaller (about 7 and 11%, respectively).
Joint Effects of Race/Ethnicity and Age by Gender
Tables 4 and 5 present the results of analyses that examine the joint effects of
race/ethnicity and age on sentence outcomes separately for males and females.
Looking at the results for males (Table 4), there is a high degree of uniformity in
sentencing outcomes across most racial/ethnic-age subgroups; however, there
SENTENCING IN U.S. FEDERAL COURTS 17
are some notable pockets of punishment and leniency (Note: the reference
category is white males ages 18­20 years old). First, young Hispanic defendants
are the most likely to receive prison sentences. The odds of incarceration for
Hispanic men ages 18­20 are almost double the odds for white men ages 18­20;
Hispanic men ages 21­29 also have a higher likelihood of receiving a prison
sentence (odds ratio = 1.82). Black men ages 21­29 are more likely to receive
prison sentences than the youngest white men (odds ratio = 1.40), as well.
Second, only the oldest white male defendants are significantly less likely to
receive prison sentences compared to the youngest white male defendants.
Third, looking at sentence length outcomes, the youngest black men (ages 18­20
and ages 21­29) receive sentences that are between 26 and 42% longer than
white men ages 18­20. Similarly, yet less severely than young black men, a
broad age range of Hispanic men (ages 21­59) receives sentences 15 to 22%
longer than the youngest white men.
Table 5 replicates the above analysis for female defendants and reveals few
notable findings (Note: white female defendants ages 18­20 serve as the

reference category). First, there are fewer statistical differences among
females than among males; however, this is partly due to the reduced statistical
power in the regression model examining female defendants. Nonetheless, with
the exception of the oldest defendant groups, the sentence outcomes of
females of all ages are not significantly different from the reference category.
Second, there are few black-Hispanic-white differences. One notable (although
not statistically significant) finding is that young black women who receive an
incarceration sentence are sentenced to terms about 8% shorter than similarly
aged white women.

of any one defendant characteristic and bring to light extralegal disparities that
are otherwise hidden when examining only additive models. We highlight here
some of the important findings.
First, it is readily apparent that the youngest Hispanic and black men receive
the harshest sentence outcomes among all defendant subgroups. Young Hispanic
men are the most likely to be sent to prison (odds ratio = 1.80 compared to
young white men) and young black men receive the longest prison sentences
(42% longer than young white men) after taking into account important legal
and contextual factors. Importantly, racial/ethnic differences are considerably
larger among the youngest men than is apparent when examining the average
effects of race/ethnicity across all defendants (see Table 2). Indeed, analyses
that do not consider the joint effects of multiple statuses risk underestimating
the influence of race/ethnicity for specific subgroups of defendants.
Second, when taking into account multiple defendant statuses, there is
considerable variation in the sentences received by defendants. Comparing the
most disparately sentenced groups, the odds are about six times greater that a
young Hispanic male will receive a prison sentence as compared to the oldest
white female defendants. Similarly, the youngest black males (between the
ages of 18 and 20) receive prison sentences that are about 80% longer than black
female defendants in their 50s. It is important to point out that the sample sizes
for female defendants ages 60 and over, especially blacks and Hispanics, are
quite small (n = 30 and 22, respectively). Therefore, comparisons involving
these defendant groups should be undertaken with caution.
Third, although sentence severity rankings for incarceration are higher on
average for male defendants (and especially Hispanic male defendants) than
female defendants, there are some exceptions. For instance, Hispanic female
defendants ages 18­20 rank 11th in terms of incarceration sentence severity.
That is, they are as likely to receive a prison sentence as similar-aged white
males. In contrast, black female defendants appear to receive sentencing
benefits that are not as readily available for Hispanic female defendants. All age
groups of black female defendants are found at the bottom of the rank ordering.
A similar relative ordering between Hispanic and black women exists for
sentence length outcomes. On average, black women receive shorter sentences
than Hispanic women after controlling for legal and contextual factors. This is
particularly notable given that black men receive the longest sentences overall.
Discussion
This work contributes to a growing body of research that considers the
combined impact of multiple defendant statuses on sentencing outcomes. In
this paper, we examine both the independent and joint effects of race/ethnic-
ity, gender, and age on incarceration and sentence length outcomes using
federal court data collected by the USSC. Importantly, the data used in the
present study are some of the best available for this kind of examination
SENTENCING IN U.S. FEDERAL COURTS 21
because they are rich with important legal control variables and contain
sufficient numbers of female and Hispanic defendants to enable a more robust
analysis of defendant subgroup than has been previously performed.
Consistent with prior research on sentencing, we find that legal factors are
the most important predictors of sentencing outcomes; defendants with more
extensive criminal histories and more serious offense conduct are more likely to
receive harsher sentences than those with less extensive criminal histories and
less serious offense conduct. However, we also determine that, net of legal and
contextual controls, race/ethnicity, gender, and age have significant indepen-
dent effects on sentencing outcomes. Furthermore, when examined in combina-
tion, the findings reveal that there is a considerable amount of variation in the
sentencing outcomes of defendants depending on their relative social-structural
position in society, and that particularly harsh punishments are focused dispro-
portionately on select defendant groups.
More specifically, our results show that (1) Hispanic defendants and black
defendants receive harsher sentences than white defendants, (2) males receive
harsher sentences than females, (3) younger defendants receive harsher
sentences than older defendants, (4) race/ethnicity differences in sentencing
are larger among men than among women, (5) harsher sentences are more
concentrated among the young for Hispanic defendants (for in/out) and black
defendants (for sentence length) than for white defendants, (6) harsher
sentences tend to be more concentrated among the young for male defendants
than for female defendants, (7) harsher sentences are more concentrated
among young black and Hispanic defendants for males than for females, and (8)
defendants who are young, Hispanic or black, and male receive the harshest
sentences of all racial/ethnic-gender-age subgroups. Overall, our results from
the federal courts are consistent with those of other researchers examining the
impact of multiple defendant statuses on sentencing outcomes in state courts
(Spohn & Holleran, 2000; Steffensmeier & Demuth, 2006; Steffensmeier et al.
1998). That is, even in a sentencing system with a relatively rigid set of formal
guidelines (i.e., compared with many state systems), unexplained extralegal
disparities persist and are, in many cases, quite large.
Several findings are particularly noteworthy. First, across all the compari-
sons, young Hispanic male defendants are the most likely to be sentenced to
prison and young black male defendants receive the longest sentence lengths.
Apparently, similar to young black males, young Hispanic males also pay an
"imprisonment penalty" at sentencing (see Spohn & Holleran, 2000). In other
words, there is a significant interrelationship among race/ethnicity, gender,
and age that produces substantially harsher sentences for these categories of
defendants. Second, although racial/ethnic differences are smaller overall
among women than among men, it is notable that the youngest Hispanic
women receive sentences that are more similar to those received by male
defendants than to other female defendants. In contrast, compared to the
harsher punishments given to black men vis-à-vis white men, black women are
treated similar to or more leniently than white women. In this sense, Hispanic
22 DOERNER AND DEMUTH
defendants are more broadly subjected to harsh punishments than black
defendants. Third, substantial differences in sentencing outcomes exist when
comparisons are made between the most dissimilar groups. For example, the
odds of incarceration are over six times greater for young Hispanic males than
for the oldest female defendants. And, the youngest black males receive
prison sentences that are 80% longer than similarly situated older black
females.
The results of the present study are consistent with the focal concerns perspec-
tive (Steffensmeier et al. 1998) that argues that legal decision-making is orga-
nized around concerns of blameworthiness, dangerousness, and other practical
constraints. Indeed, the primary determinants of sentencing decisions are the
past and present criminal behaviors of defendants. However, it is also possible
that legal attributions of culpability and criminal risk are influenced by commonly
held perceptions of membership in various racial/ethnic, gender, and age groups.
That we find unexplained extralegal sources of sentencing disparity is suggestive
that stereotypes may be influential and inequalities in the application of the law
may occur in court proceedings despite the existence of structured guidelines
designed to avoid such unequal treatment.
It is important to emphasize that we are not suggesting that these dispari-
ties necessarily result from a conscious or overt hostility toward certain defen-
dant groups or that these disparities are even unwarranted. For instance, it is
possible that the limited time and information available to legal agents at
sentencing may result in sentencing disparities that unconsciously and uninten-
tionally disadvantage some defendants relative to others. It is also possible
that the disparities uncovered in our analysis are an artifact of model
misspecification (e.g., omitted variable bias). That is, we may be lacking rele-
vant information that, if included in our models, would explain the racial/
ethnic, gender, and age disparities in our models. For example, women may
be sentenced more leniently than men because they are, on average, more
remorseful than men. If we have not adequately controlled for these gender
differences in remorse in our models, then any apparent gender disparity may
not be "real." Nonetheless, these data are among the best suited for the anal-
ysis undertaken here.
One limitation of this study is that socioeconomic status (SES) information is
not included in the analysis. Prior research indicates that social class may play a
role at the sentencing stage (e.g., see impact of unemployment, Spohn &
Holleran, 2000). However, it is not unusual for measures of SES to be absent in
sentencing studies. In prior years of federal data, over 50% of defendants list
their incomes as $0, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of race/
ethnicity (or gender or age) and social class (see Steffensmeier & Demuth,
2000). In the data set used in the present study, a variable representing defen-
dant income is not even available. Being able to differentiate between race/
ethnicity and SES would help us to "fine tune" our theoretical explanations, but
would not reduce the significance of our findings in that both racial and social
class disparities are unwarranted under the guidelines. Future research needs to
SENTENCING IN U.S. FEDERAL COURTS 23
explore the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities are truly a function of
racial perceptions versus economic constraints that limit the ability of defen-
dants to resist legal sanctions. In addition, future research should explore the
use of education as a predictor for defendant income/SES to determine if this
extralegal factor further influences sentencing outcomes.
A final limitation of the present study is that we only examine the outcomes
of citizen defendants. Noncitizen defendants are eliminated from the analysis
because information provided for them may be incomplete, and there is often an
underestimation of prior criminal history. In addition, the federal cases against
noncitizen defendants differ significantly from citizen defendants, which make
comparisons of sentencing outcomes difficult. Our understanding of the treat-
ment of Hispanic defendants (which comprise the majority of noncitizens in the
federal system) would benefit from the exploration of differences not only
between citizens and noncitizens, but also between illegal aliens and residential
aliens. It is important to examine these differences because of the potential for
perceptions surrounding ethnic threat and foreign status (i.e., notion of being an
illegal alien) to influence the treatment of Hispanics, U.S. citizens or not.
Despite the limitations that we have discussed here, all of the results point in
one direction--to the robust findings that (1) defendants appear to be treated
differently based on race/ethnicity, gender, and age to the detriment of
Hispanic, black, male and young defendants and that (2) the interactive effects
of race/ethnicity, gender, and age have a larger combined impact than the
independent effects such that young black and Hispanic males bear the dispro-
portionate brunt of sentencing in the federal courts.
Conclusion
The analysis of extralegal sentencing disparities in the federal courts under-
taken in the present study provides insight into the combined influence of
multiple defendant characteristics on sentencing outcomes under a relatively
more restrictive guideline system than has been previously examined. Our find-
ings are consistent with those of past studies that demonstrate the importance
of considering joint effects of race/ethnicity, gender, and age on sentencing
outcomes and, furthermore, suggest that particularly harsh sentences are
focused on a narrow segment of the defendant population--that is, young
Hispanic and black males. The harsher treatment of young male racial/ethnic
minorities at sentencing is consistent with the focal concerns perspective on
judicial decision-making and supports the notion that differences in criminal
punishment are only partially explained by differences in criminal behavior. Not
only is there a great deal of variation in the sentencing outcomes of different
racial/ethnic-gender-age subgroups, but the findings of the present study add
new information to a growing body of literature on sentencing that suggests that
Hispanic defendants, like black defendants, may be disadvantaged within state
and federal court systems.
24 DOERNER AND DEMUTH
Although recent investigations have improved our knowledge of the extrale-
gal, legal, and contextual determinants of sentencing outcomes, our under-
standing of the impact of these factors on the broader case process remains
incomplete. There is still a need to examine the multiple decision-making
stages that both precede and follow sentencing. For example, future research
would benefit from applying the methods used in the present study to the
pretrial release stage and to parole/violation decisions. Furthermore, it is
important that future studies of legal decision-making explore the role of
underexamined defendant characteristics such as unemployment, education,
poverty, and citizenship status. Future research should also take advantage of
qualitative techniques, such as gathering more detailed interview and observa-
tional information from judges and other court personnel (e.g., see Smith,
Rodriguez, & Zatz, 2006, for a study on the role of extralegal attributions in
juvenile court decision-making). This would help us to better understand court
decisions, including how information is processed, how extralegal factors might
influence case outcomes, and whether the focal concerns of legal agents
influence decision-making.
