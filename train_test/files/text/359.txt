FOR THE SEARCH STUDY GROUP*
OBJECTIVE -- To determine the extent of -cell function in youth with diabetes and GAD65
and/or IA2 autoantibodies.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Fasting C-peptide levels from 2,789
GAD65- and/or IA2 autoantibody-positive youth aged 1­23 years from the SEARCH for Diabetes
in Youth study were used. Preserved -cell function was defined on the basis of cut points
derived from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) (fasting C-peptide 0.23
ng/ml) and from the U.S. adolescent population of the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) 5th percentile for fasting C-peptide (1.0 ng/ml). We compared the
clinical characteristics between those with and without preserved -cell function.
RESULTS -- Within the first year of diagnosis, 82.9% of youth had a fasting C-peptide 0.23
ng/ml and 31.2% had values 1.0 ng/ml. Among those with 5 years of diabetes duration,
10.7% had preserved -cell function based on the DCCT cutoff and 1.0% were above the 5th
percentile of the NHANES population.
CONCLUSIONS -- Within the 1st year of diagnosis, four of five youth with autoantibody-
positive diabetes have clinically significant amounts of residual -cell function and about one-
third have fasting C-peptide levels above the 5th percentile of a healthy adolescent population.
Even 5 years after diagnosis, 1 of 10 has fasting C-peptide above a clinically significant threshold.
These findings have implications for clinical classification of youth with diabetes as well as
clinical trials aimed to preserve -cell function after diabetes onset.

Immune-mediated -cell destruction,
marked by the presence of diabetes au-
toantibodies, occurs before and contin-
ues after the clinical diagnosis of type 1
diabetes. This model has served as the
foundation of pathophysiological studies
of the disease process and clinical studies
designed to identify future risk for diabetes
and to modify clinical course. The resultant
perception is that most individuals with
type 1 diabetes will have complete destruc-
tion of -cells within a few years after diag-
nosis without a targeted intervention to
sustain -cell function.
Despite frequent use of this model in
research and patient care, it represents
only part of the picture. Data from place-
bo-controlled populations in clinical inter-
vention trials suggest that some individuals
with type 1 diabetes will have persistent
-cell function years after diagnosis (1,2).
The screening phase of the Diabetes Con-
trol and Complications Trial (DCCT)
demonstrated that 48% of adults had sig-
nificant C-peptide levels within 5 years of
diagnosis, and 8% had significant C-
peptide 5­15 years after diagnosis (3).
Another study reported similar findings
in 15% of individuals with measurable C-
peptide levels 8­15 years after diagnosis
(4). Multiple studies have reported that
the loss of -cell function after diagnosis
is related to age of onset as well as to fac-
tors linked to autoimmunity such as au-
toantibodies (5­11). Nonetheless, there is
a common belief that persistence of -cell
function is rare in young children with
type 1 diabetes.
The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth
(SEARCH) study, designed to determine
the prevalence, incidence, and character-
istics of diabetes in U.S. youth, provides
an opportunity to examine the frequency
of residual -cell function in a popula-
tion-based sample of GAD65 or IA2
youth with diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data for this analysis
derive from the SEARCH study as de-
scribed previously (12). SEARCH is a
population-based study conducted at six
centersintheU.S.,includingexisting(prev-
alent) and newly diagnosed (incident) cases
of diabetes in youth aged 20 years. Partic-
ipants were asked to complete an initial sur-
vey and then were invited to an in-person
study visit. After informed consent was pro-
vided, a brief examination was performed
and blood samples were obtained.

ipated in the in-person visit and had fast-
ing C-peptide measured were eligible for
this study (n  4,529). The present anal-
ysis includes 2,789 SEARCH participants
who are also GAD65 and/or IA2 antibody
positive. DNA samples were available for
HLA analysis for 1,968 (70.6%) of these
individuals.
Measurements
BMI was normalized as standard devia-
tion score (SDS or Z score) based on age
and sex. Weight was classified according
to sex-specific percentiles on Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention BMI-for-
age growth charts as follows: under-
weight, 15th percentile; healthy weight,
15th­85th percentile; overweight,
85th­95th percentile; and obese,
95th percentile.
Laboratory methods
Fasting samples were obtained under
conditions of metabolic stability, defined
as no episode of diabetic ketoacidosis
during the previous month. Assays were
performed at the Northwest Lipid Metab-
olism and Diabetes Research Laborato-
ries, University of Washington.
Autoantibody testing was performed
using a standardized assay protocol and a
common serum calibrator developed by
the National Institute of Diabetes and Di-
gestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)-
sponsored standardization group. Results
are expressed as NIDDK units (NIDDKU)
per milliliter. Based on analysis of 550
samples, the cutoff values for positivity/
negativity are 33 NIDDKU/ml for GAD65
and 5 NIDDKU/ml for IA2. The calcu-
lated specificity and sensitivity are 97 and
76, respectively, for GAD65 and 99 and
64, respectively, for IA2.
C-peptide was measured by a two-site
immunoenzymetric assay (Tosoh Bio-
science, San Francisco, CA). The assay
sensitivity is 0.05 ng/ml.
A1C levels were determined by an au-
tomated nonporous ion-exchange high-
performance liquid chromatography
system (G-7 Tosoh Biosciences) with ref-
erence ranges of 4.2­5.9% and HLA class
II genotyping was performed by a com-
mercially available LABType SSO method
(OneLambda, Los Angeles, CA).
C-peptide categories
DCCT. Post hoc analysis of DCCT data
demonstrated that those with preserved
C-peptide, defined as stimulated C-
peptide, value 0.6 ng/ml, had superior
clinical outcomes, including less hypo-
glycemia and retinopathy, than those
with lower C-peptide (13). Re-analysis of
these data indicated that the correspond-
ing fasting C-peptide was 0.23 ng/ml (J.
Lachin, P.F. McGee, personal communi-
cation). Fasting C-peptide values 0.23
ng/ml are therefore considered clinically
significant.
Healthy adolescents. The 5th and 50th
percentiles of fasting C-peptide in healthy
adolescents, aged 12­19 years, who par-
ticipated in the National Health and Nu-
trition Survey 1999­2002 (NHANES),
were, respectively, 1.0 and 1.9 ng/ml
(14).
Statistics
SAS for Windows (version 9.1; SAS Insti-
tute, Cary, NC) was used for analysis. 2
or t tests were used to evaluate relation-
ships between preserved -cell function
status and characteristics of interest. Two
sets of regression models were run. The
first included logistic regression models
examining associations between variables
of interest and preserved -cell function
status, stratified by duration of diabetes
(1, 1­2, and 2 years). Next, among
participants with preserved C-peptide
levels based on the DCCT cutoff, multiple
linear regression models were used to
identify variables significantly associated
with fasting C-peptide levels. All logistic
and linear regression models included the
following covariates: age at diagnosis, sex,
race/ethnicity, BMI Z score at time of the
visit, A1C, number of autoantibodies
present, fasting plasma glucose, and HLA
genotype. In addition, linear models were
adjusted for duration of disease.
RESULTS -- The average age at diag-
nosis was 9.0 years: in 16% (n  434) of
the individuals diabetes was diagnosed
when they were 5 years of age, 38%
(n  1,057) were between ages 5 and 10,
37% (n  1,028) were between ages 11
and 15, and 10% (n  270) were between
15 and 19 years of age at diagnosis. Aver-
age duration of diabetes was 3 years, with
33% (n  925) having duration of 1
year, 24% (n  661) having duration of
1­2 years, and 43% (n  1,202) having
duration of years.
Among individuals with duration of
diabetes of 1 year, 82.9% had a fasting
C-peptide level 0.23 ng/ml, 31.2% had
fasting C-peptide at or above the 5th per-
centile of the NHANES population and
7.2% had fasting C-peptide at or above
the NHANES 50th percentile level. As ex-
pected, the proportion of individuals with
preserved C-peptide diminished with in-
creasing disease duration. This finding is
illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the pro-
portion with preserved C-peptide in
quarterly intervals from time from diag-
nosis. Among those with duration of 5
years, 10.7% had preserved C-peptide at
the DCCT cut point, 1.0% at NHANES
5th percentile, and 0% at NHANES 50th
percentile.
We then explored various character-
istics of participants with and without
preserved fasting C-peptide (Table 1). In
the unadjusted analysis, the proportion of
non-Hispanic whites who had preserved
fasting C-peptide was smaller than that of
other race/ethnicities. More individuals
with preserved C-peptide had two anti-
bodies and a significantly higher percent-
age of HLA DR15. In addition, those with
preserved fasting C-peptide were older at
diagnosis, had a shorter duration of dia-
betes, and had a lower A1C at the time of
the study visit. Those with C-peptide
above the NHANES 5th percentile also
had a higher BMI Z score than those with
C-peptide below this level.
Figure 2 presents the results of the mul-
tiple logistic regression models with the di-
chotomous outcome of preserved fasting
C-peptide status based on the DCCT defi-
nition stratified by diabetes duration. Vari-
ables found to be independently associated
with preserved -cell function in all the
models included older age at diagnosis and
lower A1C at time of study visit. Race/
ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white
was also significant for those participants
with diabetes duration of 1­2 years and 2
years; higher current BMI Z score was also
significant only for those participants with
duration of 1­2 years (Fig. 2).
Among those with preserved fasting
C-peptide (DCCT definition), older age at
diagnosis, higher current BMI Z score,
race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic
white, female sex, lower A1C, and shorter
duration of diabetes were independently
related to higher fasting C-peptide levels.
The association of age at diagnosis and
diabetes duration with fasting C-peptide
is illustrated in Fig. 3, demonstrating that
lower fasting C-peptide is seen in partici-
pants with diagnosis of diabetes at a
younger age and those with longer dura-
tion of disease. The relationship between
weight categories at the time of the study
visit and prevalence of preserved -cell
function at various times from diagnosis is
shown in Fig. 4. Although a greater per-
centage of obese/overweight compared

from diagnosis, respectively).

sidual -cell function within the 1st year
after diagnosis. In adjusted regression
analyses of individuals within 1 year of
diagnosis only age at diagnosis and A1C
were identified as significant variables in
whether or not C-peptide was preserved.
In addition, race/ethnicity was important
in those further from diagnosis. Although
it is known that -cell function continues
to decline after diabetes diagnosis, our
data also indicate that as many as 1 of 10

youth have preserved -cell function
even 5 years after diagnosis.
Despite evidence to the contrary, the
belief persists that youth with type 1 dia-
betes have little insulin secretion at diag-
nosis and that insulin secretion rapidly
disappears after diagnosis. Classification
schemes define type 1 diabetes as a state
of absolute insulin deficiency and type 2
diabetes as a state of insulin resistance
combined with inadequate insulin secre-
tion (15). Thus, health care providers
have used C-peptide measurements clin-
ically to establish type of diabetes and to
select therapies. Although this analysis
does not address the question of whether
there is a C-peptide cut point value that
could distinguish different types of diabe-
tes, the data demonstrate that many youth
with antibody-positive diabetes have C-
peptide levels within the range of those of
the normal population. Specifically,
within 1 year of diagnosis, almost one-
third of subjects had C-peptide values
that exceeded the 5th percentile and 1
in 14 (7%) exceeded the 50th percentile
for healthy adolescents.
Most researchers (3,13,16­20), but
not all (21), documented that even a small
amount of residual -cell function is of
clinical significance. Using a level of C-
peptide associated with clinical signifi-
cance in the DCCT, we found that 82.9%
of participants with diabetes duration of
1 year exceed this threshold. The fre-
quency of clinically significant -cell
function is lower among youth with
longer duration of disease (53.3% for du-
ration of 1­2 years and 18.6% for 4­5
years). Because the DCCT cut point has
been suggested as an end point for clinical
trials designed to preserve -cell func-
tion, we suggest caution in interpreting
data from nonrandomized trials or short-
term pilot studies because our data show
that endogenous C-peptide is present
years after diagnosis in a substantial por-
tion of children.
The data in the present study are sim-
ilar to those reported by the DCCT, in
which 33% of the 466 adolescents tested
5 years from diagnosis had residual
-cell function. Because the DCCT popu-
lation only included individuals aged
13 years, many pediatricians felt that
preservation of C-peptide was unlikely in
younger children. Among SEARCH par-
ticipants, we found a profound impact
of advancing age at diagnosis on preser-
vation of C-peptide production. The as-
sociation was linear throughout the
complete range of age of diagnosis (from 1
to 20 years), suggesting that insulin resis-
tance associated with puberty does not ac-
count for this finding. Others have
demonstrated an effect of age on C-
peptide in individuals at risk for type 1
diabetes (22).
Several reasons have been suggested
for preserved -cell function. First, in-
creased awareness of the symptoms of
type 1 diabetes and improved screening
and diagnostic tools may have resulted in
diagnosis at an earlier point in the auto-
immune destruction of the -cells. Thus,
the individuals may have more -cell re-
serve at diagnosis. Second, aggressive
treatment at diagnosis, with rapid and
tight control of hyperglycemia, may result
in improved -cell function (23). Third,
increased insulin resistance associated
with the epidemic of obesity may have
created a greater strain on the declining
-cell function resulting in diagnosis at a
time when the individuals have more
-cell function than individuals in the
past (24). Consistent with this concept,
among those with preserved -cell func-
tion, BMI Z score was an important vari-
able in determining the fasting C-peptide
level. However, the impact of BMI on
whether or not C-peptide was preserved
was less clear. As evident in Fig. 4, even
many years from diagnosis, about 10% of
normal-weight individuals had preserved
function, suggesting that other, as yet, un-
characterized factors contribute to heter-
ogeneity in disease progression.
This study also emphasizes the rela-
tionship between A1C and C-peptide but
provides no insight as to whether better
glucose control results in preserved func-
tion or whether preserved function allows
for better A1C. Prospectively conducted
trials with clinical data such as insulin
use, carbohydrate consumption, and ex-
ercise may be helpful to address this
question.
This article documents the frequency
of preserved -cell function in a popula-
tion-based racially/ethnically diverse co-
hort of antibody-positive youth with
diabetes. Although the fasting C-peptide
concentration in antibody-positive youth
with diabetes is often below normal, these
data suggest that clinically significant
amounts may persist in some individuals
for some time even among subjects with
more than one autoantibody. Further-
more, these data indicate that there is a
marked relationship between age at diag-
nosis, race/ethnicity, and residual C-
peptide. Differences in pathophysiology
between non-Hispanic white youth and
youth of other races/ethnicities may be
present. Incorporating age and race/
ethnicity into assessments of residual
-cell function may provide a better pic-
ture of the natural history of disease both
before and after diagnosis and a more ac-
curate assessment of the effectiveness of
interventions designed to prevent -cell
destruction.
