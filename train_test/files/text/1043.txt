Objectives. According to the 2000 Census, about 1.2 million persons over age 50 are currently cohabiting. Do these
unmarried cohabiting partnerships provide adults with mental health benefits that are similar to those enjoyed by marrieds?
We extended prior work on marital status and depression by including cohabitation in our conceptualization of marital
status.
Methods. We used data from the 1998 Health and Retirement Study (N ¼ 18,598) to examine the relationship between
marital status and depressive symptoms among adults over age 50. We also examined gender differences in this
association.
Results. We found that cohabitors report more depressive symptoms, on average, than do marrieds, net of economic
resources, social support, and physical health. Additional analyses revealed that only among men do cohabitors report
significantly higher depression scores. Cohabiting and married women as well as cohabiting men experience similar levels
of depression, and all of these groups report levels that are significantly higher than married men's.
Discussion. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for nontraditional living arrangements among
persons aged 50 and older. Cohabitation appears to be more consequential for men's than women's depressive symptoms.
FAMILY structures and forms have become increasingly
diverse over the last few decades. Americans continue to
delay marriage entry, divorce rates remain high, and singlehood
and unmarried cohabitation are increasingly common. Al-
though there has been considerable attention to these patterns
and their consequences among young and working-age adults
(e.g., Espenshade, 1985; Oppenheimer, 1988; Smock, 2000),
comparatively few researchers have investigated the implica-
tions of such trends among middle-aged and older adults.
Several scholars have noted that a declining share of the older
adult population will be married in the future (e.g., Allen,
Blieszner, & Roberto, 2000; Cooney & Dunne, 2001; De Jong
Gierveld, 2004). As baby boomers age into retirement and
adults experience lengthening life expectancies, it is important
to examine the consequences of the growing array of living
arrangements for the mental health of middle-aged and older
adults. We use data from the 1998 Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) to evaluate the significance of marital status and living
arrangements for depression among adults aged 50 and over. In
particular, we extend prior research by including unmarried
cohabitors to determine whether intimate partnerships formed
outside of marriage offer middle-aged and older adults protec-
tive effects similar to those of marriage.
BACKGROUND
The rapid growth in cohabitation has altered the family life
course. Americans' attitudes toward cohabitation are increas-
ingly favorable (Thornton & Young-DeMarco, 2001), and this
affinity is reflected in their behavior. In 1970, there were about
500,000 cohabiting couples, whereas today there are about 5
million (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001). The modal path to
marriage is cohabitation. Indeed, recent declines in marriage are
offset by corresponding increases in cohabitation (Bumpass &
Lu, 2000).
Apart from the rapid growth in cohabitation, the age structure
of the United States is also changing. The number of persons
over age 50 increased by 50% between 1970 and 2000 (2000
Census Summary File 1). This population is projected to grow
26% just in the next decade (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001).
Few studies have investigated nontraditional living arrange-
ments among these adults, yet it is anticipated that this group
will spend less time in marriage and more time in other family
forms such as cohabitation (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). Indeed,
Allen and colleagues (2000) assert that ``young adults are not
the sole innovators in pioneering the changes taking place in
family life today'' (p. 913). In this context, it is imperative that
researchers examine all living arrangements among middle-
aged and older adults, including cohabitation.
The growth in cohabitation coupled with the growth in the
population over age 50 portends significant increases in cohabi-
tation. Chevan's (1996) estimates from the 1960 and 1990
Censuses suggest that cohabitation among persons aged 60 and
older increased from slightly less than 10,000 in 1960 to more
than 400,000 in 1990, although these figures are based on
indirect measures of cohabitation. The 2000 Census indicates
that over 1.2 million persons aged 50 and older are cohabiting.
However, a recent review of intimate relationships in older
adulthood revealed that there is ``no research base on cohabit-
ing unions in later life'' (Cooney & Dunne, 2001, p. 853).
Indeed, our review of published studies on cohabitation among
middle-aged and older people revealed only three (Chevan,
1996; De Jong Gierveld, 2004; Hatch, 1995). The research by

Chevan (1996) and Hatch (1995) rely on indirect measures
of cohabitation and use data from the 1960­1990 and 1980
Censuses, respectively. Not only do these studies suffer from
possible underreporting biases, they are also limited by the
narrow range of measures available in the census to predict
cohabitation experience. De Jong Gierveld's (2004) study ex-
amines sociodemographic determinants of repartnering (i.e.,
remarriage, cohabitation, or living apart together) among a
sample of divorced and widowed middle-aged and older adults
in The Netherlands. The robustness of her findings is compro-
mised by both the small number of cohabitors in the sample
(N ¼ 69) and the narrow range of predictors of repartnering.
Incorporating cohabitation in studies of marital status and
well-being among middle-aged and older adults is important for
at least two reasons. First, there are significant demographic
processes unfolding that point to an increase in cohabitation
among this group. This increase is likely to accelerate in the
future as cohabitation has been common among baby boomers
and cohabitation levels are actually higher among previously
(versus never) married individuals (Bumpass & Lu, 2000;
Cooney & Dunne, 2001).
Second, from a theoretical standpoint, cohabitation likely
has a unique meaning and plays a different role in the life course
of older versus younger adults (Chevan, 1996; Hatch, 1995).
The motivations for cohabitation among middle-aged and older
persons are likely to differ from those of young adults, and thus
the implications of cohabitation for the mental health of middle-
aged and older adults also may be distinct. Unlike their younger
counterparts, older adults--especially women--may not be as
interested in marriage (Bulcroft & Bulcroft, 1991; Bulcroft,
Bulcroft, Hatch, & Borgatta, 1989; Chevan, 1996; De Jong
Gierveld, 2004; Hatch, 1995; Talbott, 1998). Indeed, unmarried
adults over age 60 are as likely to express an interest in cohab-
iting as they are in eventually getting married (Bulcroft &
Bulcroft, 1991). Additionally, the disincentives for marriage are
larger among middle-aged and older adults as they are especially
likely to have economic resources whose value may be diluted
or compromised through marriage.
MARITAL STATUS AND MENTAL HEALTH
Numerous studies have shown that marrieds enjoy higher
levels of mental and physical health than their unmarried
counterparts (e.g., Gove, Hughes, & Style, 1983; Gove, Style,
& Hughes, 1990; Lamb, Lee, & DeMaris, 2003; Lee,
Seccombe, & Shehan, 1991; Mirowsky & Ross, 1989; Rogers
1995; Ross, 1995). Moreover, it seems the positive benefits that
accrue to marrieds are not merely an artifact of selection of the
physically and mentally healthy into marriage (e.g., Gove et al.,
1983, 1990; Hughes & Gove, 1981; Ross, Mirowsky, &
Goldsteen, 1991; although for an exception, see Mastekaasa,
1992). Instead, marrieds' greater economic resources and
access to an intimate partner account for much of their
advantage in psychological well-being (Hughes & Gove, 1981).
Cohabitors are more depressed than their married counter-
parts, on average (Brown, 2000; Horwitz & White, 1998; Lamb
et al., 2003). The higher levels of depression among cohabitors
versus marrieds reflect the greater instability characterizing
cohabiting relationships (Brown, 2000). Nonetheless, cohab-
itors tend to report lower levels of depression and higher levels
of happiness than singles (Kurdek, 1991). Whether these pat-
terns are evident among middle-aged and older adults is
unknown; we are not aware of any study of depressive symp-
toms in this population that explicitly examines cohabitors. To
help formulate a framework for understanding the mental health
of middle-aged and older cohabitors, we draw on the research
that addresses the associations between marital status and
depressive symptoms in later adulthood.
Research on mental health among middle-aged and older
adults has emphasized the consequences of widowhood, an
experience that is especially common among women (Lee,
Willetts, & Seccombe, 1998; Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler,
1992). Widowed persons are more depressed, on average, than
their married and single counterparts, and these marital status
differences are larger among men than women (Cooney &
Dunne, 2001; Lee et al., 1998, 2001; Umberson et al., 1992).
This gender gap is a function of fewer social ties, more health
problems, and a reluctance to ask for help that characterize
many widowers. The divorced report levels of depression that
are similar to those of the widowed, which is not surprising
when we consider the deleterious effects divorce can have on
the accumulation of economic resources and the maintenance of
social and familial ties (Cooney & Dunne, 2001; Hyman,
1983). Notably, never marrieds exhibit fewer depressive
symptoms than their divorced and widowed counterparts, al-
though their levels of depression are somewhat higher than
marrieds'. As most never marrieds do not have children, family
support tends to be weak, but this is offset by extensive
friendship networks (Cooney & Dunne, 2001).
COHABITATION AMONG MIDDLE-AGED AND
OLDER ADULTS
Prior research indicates that marital status differences in
depression are due primarily to variation in economic resources,
social support, and physical health (Cooney & Dunne, 2001;
Lee et al., 1998, 2001; Umberson et al., 1992). We review the
literature on how middle-aged and older cohabitors fare across
these domains relative to other marital status groups to help us
formulate hypotheses about how depression among cohabitors
compares with that of persons with other marital statuses.
Economic Resources
Chevan's (1996) analysis of cohabitation among older
unmarried adults (aged 60 and over) reveals that the poor and
near poor are more likely to be cohabiting than their nonpoor
counterparts. The association between men's employment and
cohabitation is unclear. Whereas Chevan (1996) finds that labor
force participation is positively associated with cohabitation
among men, Hatch's (1995) analysis of 1980 Census data
indicates that cohabiting men are less likely to be working and
have smaller incomes than either married or single men.
Among women, cohabitors have higher levels of employment
than marrieds or singles. Cohabiting women earn more than
single women but less than married women. Other economic
factors associated with cohabitation include renting (versus
owning) a home and receipt of entitlement income (Hatch,
1995). If cohabitors have fewer economic resources than
marrieds, they will likely report more depressive symptoms.
Social Support
Social support is a key coping resource that helps to buffer
stressful life events and experiences by promoting social
BROWN ET AL.
S22
integration. It appears that social support promotes the formation
of intimate partnerships. Widows with close friends are more
desirous of forming a new partnership than those without close
friends (Talbott, 1998). And organizational participation among
older unmarrieds is positively associated with dating (Bulcroft &
Bulcroft, 1991). Studies comparing the social support experi-
enced by cohabitors versus marrieds show that cohabitors report
less support (Stets, 1991). Weaker ties to others may contribute
to reports of higher levels of depressive symptoms among co-
habitors relative to marrieds. We anticipate that cohabitors will
report fewer depressive symptoms than their unpartnered (i.e.,
widowed, separated/divorced, and never married) counterparts
primarily because single persons lack the social support that
intimate partners provide.
Physical Health
Relative to marriage, cohabitation may be selective of
individuals in worse health. Poor health may make one less
attractive as a potential spouse, relegating less healthy individ-
uals to a cohabiting union, which requires a weaker commitment
from a partner. Hatch (1995) found that among older men, poor
health is positively associated with cohabitation versus remain-
ing single. This finding is consistent with Talbott's (1998) con-
tention that women do not wish to take on the burden of
caregiving that marriage at older ages often entails for women,
who are expected to be family caretakers, particularly when
men's traditional familial obligation, namely, economic pro-
vision, ends in old age. Moreover, poor health can increase stress
in intimate relationships (Booth & Johnson, 1994) and is also
associated with depression. Little is known about the physical
health of cohabitors, but to the extent that it is tied to economic
standing and related to attractiveness on the marriage market, we
anticipate that cohabitors probably report poorer health than
marrieds; this difference would partially account for their higher
levels of depression.
THE CURRENT STUDY
Our review of the literature leads us to expect that cohabitors
will report more depressive symptoms than marrieds, on aver-
age. Relative to marrieds, cohabitors have fewer economic re-
sources, lower levels of social support, and poorer health, all of
which are positively related to depression. Whether cohabitors
will report more depressive symptoms than other unmarrieds,
including widows, divorced and separated persons, and never
marrieds, is less clear. Perhaps cohabitors will report fewer
depressive symptoms than widowed and divorced individuals,
who have experienced the trauma of marital dissolution through
death or divorce, respectively. These formerly partnered
individuals probably have fewer resources and less social
support, on average, than cohabitors. They may also be in poorer
health. We anticipate that cohabitors' depressive symptoms are
unlikely to significantly differ from those of never marrieds, who
are more depressed than marrieds but less depressed than other
unmarrieds (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). To test these hypotheses,
we estimate a series of equations that initially model the
association between marital status and depressive symptoms and
then subsequently add respondents' ascribed demographic
characteristics and finally these central factors related to older
adult depression, including economic resources, social support,
and physical health, to determine the extent to which we can
account for variation in depression.
We also expect that cohabitation will be associated with
higher levels of depression among women than men. Women
tend to report more depressive symptoms than men, regardless
of union status (Gove, Style, & Hughes, 1990; Mirowksy &
Ross, 1995). Marriage appears to offer greater protective
benefits for men as there are larger marital status differences in
depression among men than women. Whereas unpartnered
women's mental health is often compromised by economic
strain, unpartnered men's mental health is undermined by low
levels of social support (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). We investi-
gate the role of gender in the marital status and depression
relationship by evaluating the significance of a marital-status-
by-gender interaction effect and estimating separate models for
women and men.
METHODS
We use data from the 1998 HRS. A nationally representative
sample of the noninstitutionalized, the 1998 HRS comprises
21,384 persons born in 1947 and earlier. Thus, at the time of the
1998 interview, respondents were as young as 51. The 1998
HRS brings together a sizable continuous cohort of older
Americans by combining four samples: the Asset and Health
Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (born 1923 and earlier), the
original 1992 HRS (born 1931­1941), and two new samples:
War Babies (born 1942­1947) and Children of the Depression
Age (born 1924­1930). The 1998 HRS encompasses multiple
domains of the lives of persons over age 50, including
information on the cognitive, economic, health, work, and
family statuses of respondents and their spouses or partners.
The HRS emphasizes health and retirement decision making as
well as how adults and their families respond to declining
health in later life. After deleting cases for which marital status
or depression is missing, the analytic sample size is 18,598.
Measures
Depression. --We use a nine-item depression scale that
includes items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--
Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977). Respondents are asked to
report whether ``much of the time during the past week you ...''
(1) felt depressed, (2) felt everything you did was an effort, (3)
felt your sleep was restless, (4) were happy (reverse coded), (5)
felt lonely, (6) enjoyed life (reverse coded), (7) felt sad, (8)
couldn't get going, and (9) had a lot of energy (reverse coded).
Responses were coded 1 for yes and 0 for no. Values on the
scale range from 1 to 10 (we added 1 to each respondent's
overall score to avoid zero values), with higher values indicat-
ing more depressive symptoms. The Cronbach alpha reliability
coefficient for this scale is 0.77.
Marital status. --HRS respondents report their marital status
at the time of interview. Approximately 2.4% of the sample is
cohabiting, yielding 449 cohabitors for analysis. About 64.4%
of respondents are married, 10.4% are separated or divorced,
19.7% are widowed, and the remaining 3% are never married.
Closer inspection of the cohabiting respondents reveals that a
majority are separated or divorced (66%) followed by widowed
(21%) and never married (13%).
COHABITATION AND MENTAL HEALTH S23
Economic resources. --We include multiple measures of
economic resources. Education is coded in years and ranges
from 0 (no formal education) to 17 (post college, i.e., 17þ years
of education). Household income is a constructed measure in
the HRS data set that incorporates bracketed income responses
using sophisticated imputation techniques. In the multivariate
models, we use logged household income to correct for the
skewness of this measure. Employment status is dummy coded
as follows: employed full-time (reference), employed part-time,
unemployed, and not working. Retirement status indicates
whether the respondent is retired. We do not include this
measure as part of the employment status variable because
many respondents are technically retired but also working in a
different job. We also include a series of variables to tap into
receipt of various benefits, all of which are coded 1 for receipt
and 0 otherwise: Social Security, welfare, veterans' benefits,
and a pension.
Social support. --Social support is gauged by several
measures. Neighborhood friends is coded 1 if the respondent
reports having good friends living in the neighborhood and
0 otherwise. Give assistance is a dummy variable coded 1 if the
respondent answered affirmatively to this question: ``Including
help with education but not shared housing or shared food or
any deed to a house, did you (or your spouse/partner) give
financial help totaling $500 or more to any of your children (or
grandchildren)'' in the last 2 years? Similarly, receive
assistance gauges whether the respondent received at least
$500 in financial assistance from a child or grandchild in the
last 2 years. Children live within 10 miles is coded 1 for those
who report at least one child resides fewer than 10 miles from
the respondent and 0 otherwise. Religiosity taps the signif-
icance of religion in the respondent's life, ranging from (1) not
too important to (3) very important.
Physical health. --We use a global measure to capture the
respondent's physical health. Respondents were asked: ``Would
you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or
poor?'' Values range from 1 to 5, with higher values indicating
poorer health.
Ascribed characteristics. --We consider the following as-
cribed characteristics: gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Although
they compose only about one-fourth of the elderly population,
men account for nearly 60% of cohabitors over age 60 (Chevan,
1996). Men report fewer depressive symptoms, on average,
than do women (e.g., Mirowsky & Ross, 1995). We code
female 1 for women and 0 for men respondents. Among older
unmarrieds, age is negatively associated with cohabitation
(Chevan, 1996). Age is also negatively related to depression
(Mirowsky & Ross, 1989). Age is coded in years. Cohabitation
is especially common among African Americans and Hispanics
(Landale & Forste, 1991; Raley, 1996). As the older population
becomes more racially and ethnically diverse with the changing
composition of our population and the lengthening life expec-
tancies of non-Whites, there is no reason not to expect that
these groups will continue to be disproportionately likely to
cohabit. African Americans are more likely to reside in cohabit-
ing unions than Whites, but Hispanics do not differ (Chevan,
1996; Hatch, 1995). Race/ethnicity is also associated with
depression; non-Whites report more depressive symptoms, on
average, than do Whites (Mirowsky & Ross, 1989). Race/
ethnicity is dummy coded: non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-
Hispanic other, and non-Hispanic White (reference).
Analytic Strategy
Our first step is to describe the weighted means of the
variables used in the analyses, emphasizing variation across
different marital statuses in depression and other relevant
factors. We also examine marital status differences in depres-
sion by gender. Next, we estimate a series of ordinary least
squares multivariate models of the relationship between marital
status and depression. Our first model establishes the bivariate
association between marital status and depression. In the
second model, we introduce ascribed characteristics including
gender, age, and race/ethnicity. The third model includes the
explanatory factors: economic resources, social support, and
physical health. The fourth model introduces interaction terms
for gender and marital status. We also estimate the first three
models separately for women and men.
The complex sampling design of the HRS means that the
sample is not self-weighting and standard errors need to be
adjusted to correct for design effects. Consequently, all descrip-
tive statistics and multivariate analyses that we present have
been weighted. Corrected standard errors were calculated using
Stata (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the weighted means of all of the variables
used in the analysis both for the total sample and separately by
marital status. Cohabitors report significantly higher levels of
depressive symptoms than marrieds. Cohabitors are less de-
pressed, on average, than either the widowed or the divorced or
separated but are indistinguishable from the never married. As
most cohabitors are formerly married, it may be that gaining a
new partner represents an improvement for those who have
lost a spouse through divorce or widowhood. However, cohab-
itation clearly does not convey the same advantage that mar-
riage does, at least in terms of depressive symptoms.
Cohabitors tend to be slightly younger than persons in other
marital statuses. Although females are disproportionately likely
to be unpartnered, the sex distribution among cohabitors and
marrieds is essentially even.
There are few marital status differences in education, al-
though cohabitors do report significantly higher average educa-
tion levels than widoweds. About 41% of cohabitors are
employed full-time, which is significantly higher than the pro-
portions employed full-time among marrieds, widoweds, and
never marrieds. Only about one-third of cohabitors report that
they are retired, compared with over 40% of marrieds.
Cohabitors are less likely to receive pension benefits than
marrieds, divorcees, or widoweds. Cohabitors and marrieds
enjoy higher levels of household income than the unpartnered,
but cohabitors' incomes are lower, on average, than marrieds'.
Levels of social support vary somewhat by marital status such
that cohabitors appear to be less likely to report having
neighborhood friends, on average, than marrieds, widoweds,
and never marrieds. Cohabitors are less likely to give or receive
assistance than are either divorced and separateds or never
marrieds. The importance of religion is lowest among
BROWN ET AL.

cohabitors. Self-reported physical health ratings are worse for
cohabitors than marrieds, although cohabitors report better
health than the widowed and never married.
There are several gender differences in the marital status and
depression relationship. Table 2 shows mean levels of depres-
sion by union status separately for women and men. Cohabiting
women report significantly more depressive symptoms than
married women but do not significantly differ from unpartnered
women. This pattern suggests that cohabitation does not offer
the same protective effects as marriage for women. Similarly,
cohabiting men report more depressive symptoms than married
men. Additionally, cohabiting men report fewer symptoms than
widowers. Among both men and women, cohabitors do not
enjoy depression scores as low as marrieds. These patterns are
denoted in Table 2 by asterisks. Bolded coefficients indicate
significant differences between men and women within a marital
status category. Women exhibit more depressive symptoms
than men in both cohabiting unions and marriages. Among the
unpartnered statuses, there are no significant gender differences
in depression scores.
Model 1 of Table 3 shows the bivariate association between
marital status and depression. Despite the presence of an
intimate partner, cohabitors report more depressive symptoms
than marrieds, on average. Although cohabitors report fewer
depressive symptoms than widows, they do not significantly
differ from either divorced or never-married persons. The
addition of ascribed characteristics, including gender, race/
ethnicity, and age, in Model 2 of Table 3 reduces the associa-
tion between marital status and depression, but not to non-
significance, as marrieds continue to report fewer depressive
symptoms than cohabitors. Women report more depressive
symptoms than men. And non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and
others report more depressive symptoms than non-Hispanic
Whites. Age is positively related to depression scores.
Model 3 of Table 3 introduces economic resources, social
support, and physical health. The inclusion of these measures
attenuates the association between marital status and de-
pression, but the coefficient for marriage remains statistically
significant. The higher average reports of depressive symptoms
by cohabitors relative to marrieds are only partially an artifact
of variation in economic resources, social support, and physical

COHABITATION AND MENTAL HEALTH S25
health. As anticipated, education and income are negatively
associated with depression. Persons who are not working report
more depressive symptoms than those working full-time.
Retirement is associated with fewer depressive symptoms, as
is receipt of a pension. And receipt of welfare assistance is
positively associated with depressive symptoms. The presence
of neighborhood friends is associated with fewer depressive
symptoms. Similarly, the greater the significance of religion in
one's life, the lower the depression score. Poor health is also
positively associated with depressive symptoms.
In Model 4 of Table 3, we examine the significance of the
interaction between gender and marital status in the full model.
This set of interaction terms does not achieve significance, nor
does it offer an improvement in fit over Model 3.
Still, the significant gender differences in depression
documented in Table 2 coupled with findings from prior work
that indicate some factors are more consequential for women's
(e.g., economic resource) than men's (e.g., social support) de-
pression suggest that multivariate models should be estimated
separately for women and men. We show these models in Table
4. For women, the first two models (Models 1a and 2a) appear
very similar to those reported for the entire sample in Table 3.
Cohabiting women report significantly more depressive
symptoms than married women but do not significantly differ
from divorced, widowed, and never-married women (Model
2a). However, the inclusion of economic resources, social
support, and physical health in Model 3a reduces the effect of
marriage to nonsignificance. Supplemental analyses revealed
that neither economic resources nor social support alone
explains the marriage effect, although in combination these

factors do attenuate the effect. Physical health by itself is
sufficient to explain the marriage effect (p ¼ .16, result not
shown), suggesting that married women's lower depression
scores reflect better health relative to cohabiting women. This is
likely to indicate a selection of healthier women into marriage
and less healthy women into cohabitation.
Among men, cohabitors report more depressive symptoms
than marrieds but fewer symptoms than widowers. Cohabiting
men's depression scores do not significantly differ from those
of either divorced or never-married men, on average, as shown
in Model 1b in Table 4. The addition of ascribed characteristics
in Model 2b does not attenuate these relationships. Similarly,
the inclusion of economic resources, social support, and physi-
cal health in Model 3b does not appreciably alter the coeffi-
cients for marital status. Thus, whereas cohabiting and married
women report similar levels of depressive symptoms when
comparably healthy, among men, cohabitation is associated
with reports of more depressive symptoms than is marriage.
Supplemental analyses (not shown) reveal that the union type
difference among men is driven by the especially low depres-
sion scores enjoyed by married men. Cohabiting women, mar-
ried women, and cohabiting men report similar levels of
depressive symptoms, and all of these groups report higher
average levels than married men.
DISCUSSION
The marital status and living arrangements of America's
middle-aged and older population are becoming increasingly
diverse. Marriage is likely to be less common in the near future
as baby boomers swell the ranks of the aged. Unmarried
cohabitors, divorcees, and never marrieds will constitute a larger
share of this population. Consequently, it is important to
examine the implications of nontraditional family structures
and living arrangements for middle-aged and older Americans.
We used the 1998 HRS, a large, recent data set that is nationally
representative of adults over age 50, to investigate the depres-
sive symptoms of people in cohabiting unions relative to those
who are married, divorced or separated, widowed, and never
married. Among these middle-aged and older adults, cohabita-

COHABITATION AND MENTAL HEALTH S27
tion is associated with reports of more depressive symptoms, on
average, than marriage, which is consistent with earlier findings
for younger adults (e.g., Brown, 2000; Lamb et al., 2003).
Notably, this difference persists even after we account for
economic resources, social support, and physical health, all of
which vary by union type (i.e., cohabitation vs marriage) and
are associated with depression scores. Cohabitors report fewer
economic resources, less social support, and poorer physical
health, on average, than do marrieds. The average levels of
depressive symptoms reported by cohabitors do not appreciably
differ from those reported by unpartnereds, including the
widowed, divorced or separated, and never married.
Our study also reveals important gender differences in the
marital status and depression relationship such that marital status
appears to be more consequential for men than women. Once we
account for variation in economic resources, social support, and
particularly physical health, women residing with a partner--
whether married or cohabiting--report similar levels of depres-
sive symptoms. Indeed, there are no significant differences in
depressive symptoms according to marital status among women
once these variables are controlled. Among men, on the other
hand, the presence of an intimate partner is not sufficient to
reduce depression scores. Instead, whether a man is involved in
a cohabiting or marital relationship is pivotal. Married men enjoy
significantly lower depression scores than cohabiting men, sug-
gesting that cohabitation does not provide men with the same
level of mental health benefits as marriage.
Why does cohabitation appear to operate similar to marriage
among women yet seems an inferior substitute for marriage
among men? First, married men are the distinct group, reporting
significantly fewer depressive symptoms than either cohabiting
men or cohabiting or married women. Second, it is possible that
men and women view relationships differently. Women may be
less interested in marriage than men because of the probability
that they will need to provide care to an infirm husband
(Talbott, 1998). Men, on the other hand, may anticipate needing
the kind of care that wives traditionally provide. Nonetheless,
women probably desire the companionship an intimate partner
provides without the commitment entailed by formal marriage
(Talbott, 1998). Thus, among women, cohabitation may be an
attractive alternative to marriage that offers similar benefits
without the obligations of traditional, gendered exchange that is
expected in marriage. Third, cohabiting men may not receive
the same levels of caregiving from their partners as married
men do from their spouses. Of course, the observed gender
difference in the union type and depression relationship may be
an artifact of selection. That is, depressive symptoms may
predict marital status. It is impossible for us to sort out cause
and effect in this cross-sectional study. Rather, we can report
only associations between marital status and depressive symp-
toms. Ultimately, longitudinal studies are needed to sort out
these competing post hoc explanations.
In addition to being unable to account for the possibility of
selection, this study has another shortcoming: We are not able
to evaluate the role of relationship quality in cohabitors' and
marrieds' depression levels. Other research has demonstrated
that the lower levels of psychological well-being reported by
cohabitors are due largely to their greater perceived relationship
instability (Brown, 2000).
To date, the focus of research on middle-aged and older adult
well-being has been restricted primarily to the consequences of
widowhood. This emphasis has obscured the dramatic shifts in
family living arrangements that have occurred among all age
groups. Middle-aged and older adults are increasingly likely to
be unmarried, and this trend is expected to intensify in the near
future as a diverse group of Americans experience a wide array
of living arrangements. Our findings demonstrate the importance
of accounting for nontraditional living arrangements among
persons over age 50. Among women, cohabitors and marrieds
report similar depression scores once health is taken into
account. In contrast, cohabitation is not equivalent to marriage in
terms of mental health among men. Married men enjoy much
lower average depression levels than cohabiting men. The next
task for future researchers is to determine why men derive fewer
mental health benefits from cohabitation than marriage.
