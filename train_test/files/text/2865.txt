Income diversification in the
German banking industry *
Ramona Busch, Thomas Kick 
Abstract
In the last few years it has been possible to observe decreasing interest margins for
German universal banks. At the same time, institutions increasingly moved part
of their business from interest to fee-earning activities. This study analyzes the
determinants of non-interest income and its impact on financial performance and
the risk profile of German banks between 1995 and 2007. We find empirical evidence
that for all German universal banks risk-adjusted returns on equity and total assets
are positively affected by higher fee income activities. Additionally, for commercial
banks we show that a strong engagement in fee-generating activities goes along
with higher risk. In order to analyze possible cross-subsidization effects between
interest and fee business we also examine how banks' expansion in fee-based services
has affected their interest margin. For savings and commercial banks we find that
institutions with a strong focus on fee business charge lower interest margins when
credit risk is controlled.

Non-technical summary
Previous diversification studies for the German banking market have examined the
composition of banks' credit portfolios thoroughly. However, these studies neglected
the aspect of income diversification. Bearing in mind the shrinking interest margins
with which German banks are faced, the question becomes highly relevant of whether
banks can take advantage of the diversification of their income sources, i.e. the
combination of interest and fee-earning activities. Theoretically, banks would benefit
from diversification when all income components are either negatively or only slightly
correlated. On the other hand, however, latest experience from the current financial
crisis has shown that boosting non-interest income activities could also destabilize
individual banks as well as the banking system as a whole.
Our study focuses on banks' primary income sources: interest and fee-earning ac-
tivities. In the academic literature, the feedback effect between a bank's profitability
and its strategic decision to expand its fee business plays only a minor role. Hence,
we would expect an increase in non-interest business to have two effects: First, a
change in a bank's profitability and, second, that rather weak banks would try to
develop alternative business opportunities.
This study is divided into two parts: First, we examine whether banks with a
heavy involvement in the fee business can increase their returns, and whether this in-
volvement goes hand in hand with higher risk taking. Owing to data considerations,
we measure activity in this business unit by fee income as a ratio of interest income
and fee income. Our database is a micro panel of supervisory balance sheet data
(BAKIS) and information on banks' lending to industry sectors (borrowers' statis-
tics) for the years 1995 to 2007. The second part of the paper focuses on banks'
interest margins. Here, we control for credit risk using loan loss provisions to show
that savings and commercial banks with a high share of fee income charge lower
interest margins. We interpret this finding as an indication of subsidization between
interest and fee business.
In sum, our analysis shows that banks with a large share of fee income exhibit
a more favorable risk-return profile, i.e. they demonstrate a higher risk-adjusted re-
turn on equity (ROE) and total assets (ROA). Additionally, for commercial banks
we find that strong activity in the fee business is accompanied by higher ROE/ROA
volatility and, therefore, by greater risk. Finally, in the case of savings and commer-
cial banks, we observe that institutions with a strong focus on fee business charge
lower risk-adjusted interest margins.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
In Diversifikationsstudien zum deutschen Bankenmarkt wurde die Zusammen-
setzung der Kreditportfolien von Banken untersucht. Aspekte der Einkommens-
diversifizierung wurden bislang jedoch ausgeblendet. Dennoch erscheint gerade in
Zeiten sinkender Zinsmargen die Frage relevant, ob Banken Vorteile durch die Di-
versifizierung ihrer Einkommensquellen, d.h. vor allem durch die Kombination von
Zins- und Provisionsgeschäft, erlangen können. Aus theoretischer Sicht sind Diver-
sifikationsvorteile dann zu erwarten, wenn sämtliche Einkommensströme entweder
negativ oder nur gering miteinander korrelieren. Dem Diversifikationsargument ste-
hen allerdings die jüngsten Erfahrungen aus der Finanzkrise entgegen, die gezeigt
haben, dass der Versuch, die Einkommensströme durch vermehrte Einnahmen aus
dem Provisionsgeschäft zu diversifizieren, auch destabilisierend auf Einzelbanken
sowie das gesamte Bankensystem wirken kann.
Unsere Studie ist auf die beiden zentralen Einkommensquellen von Banken fo-
kussiert: Das Zins- und das Provisionsgeschäft. In der akademischen Literatur findet
hierbei der Feedbackeffekt zwischen der Ertragskraft einer Bank und deren stra-
tegischen Entscheidung zur Ausweitung des Provisionsgeschäfts wenig Beachtung.
Hierbei ist zu erwarten, dass die Erhöhung des zinsunabhängigen Geschäfts einer-
seits die Ertragskraft einer Bank verändert und dass andererseits gerade ertrags-
schwächere Banken nach alternativen Geschäftsmöglichkeiten suchen werden.
In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird in einem ersten Schritt untersucht, ob Banken
mit verstärktem Engagement im Provisionsgeschäft ihre Gewinne erhöhen können
und ob dieses Engagement mit zusätzlichen Risiken verbunden ist. Wie stark ein In-
stitut im Provisionsgeschäft engagiert ist, wird dabei als Anteil der Provisionserträge
an der Summe von Zins- und Provisionserträgen gemessen. Als Datenbasis dient ein
Mikro-Panel mit bankenaufsichtlichen Bilanzdaten (BAKIS) sowie Informationen
zur Kreditvergabe der Banken in die einzelnen Wirtschaftssektoren (Kreditnehmer-
statistik) für die Jahre 1995 bis 2007. In einem zweiten Schritt wird untersucht,
inwieweit sich die wachsende Bedeutung des Provisionsgeschäfts auf die Zinsmargen
der Banken auswirkt. Dabei können wir nachweisen, dass Banken mit einem hohen
Anteil Provisionsgeschäft eine geringere Zinsmarge einfordern, wobei wir das Kre-
ditrisiko mittels der Abschreibungsquote kontrollieren. Dieses Ergebnis deuten wir
als Hinweis für eine Quersubventionierung von Zins- und Provisionsgeschäft.
Unsere Analyse zeigt, dass Banken, die einen höheren Anteil ihrer Erträge im
Provisionsgeschäft erwirtschaften, eine günstigere Risiko-Ertragssituation (gemessen
am ROE und ROA) aufweisen, d.h. deren risikoadjustierte Eigenkapitalrendite größer
ist. Gleichzeitig lässt sich für die Privatbanken feststellen, dass ein stärkeres En-
gagement im Provisionsgeschäft auch mit einer höheren Volatilität der Eigen- und
Gesamtkapitalrenditen und damit mit einem höheren Risiko verbunden ist. Für die
Gruppe der Sparkassen und Privatbanken kann zudem gezeigt werden, dass Insti-
tute mit einem starken Fokus auf das Provisionsgeschäft geringere risikoadjustierte
Zinsmargen einfordern.

1 Introduction
The German banking sector comprises three pillars: privately-owned commercial
banks, savings banks and their central institutions ("Landesbanken") and credit co-
operatives with two central institutions. All banking groups are different in terms
of ownership, geographical concentration and business model.3
In the last few years the German banking industry has experienced decreasing
interest margins and profitability. At the same time the relevance of non-interest
income has increased. Across all banking groups, between 1975 and 2007 the average
ratio of fee surplus to interest and fee surplus increased from 12% to 26%. Graph
1 shows that fee-income relative to interest income increased in all banking sectors,
whereby commercial banks traditionally create higher fee-income than cooperative
and savings banks. In 2000 this ratio reached a peak due to the agile demand for
investment share certificates and shares. In this paper we examine the relationship
between earnings from the fee business and bank performance. Our study is based
on a micro panel of supervisory balance sheet data (BAKIS) and information about
banks' lending to industry sectors (borrowers' statistics) for the years 1995 to 2007.4

reduces a firm's exposures to any particular activity, which in turn leads to risk re-
duction. In the context of the banking industry, institutions reach disintermediation
by expanding fee-earning activities. This strategy leads to greater diversification of
income sources, which might help banks to reduce risks and stabilize profits, pro-
vided the different income components are imperfectly correlated. On the contrary,
some fee income activities are associated with much higher risks than other income
sources and, therefore, they could contribute to a destabilization of both individual
banks and the whole banking system. For example, the importance of loan secu-
ritization and credit derivatives has drastically increased over the last few years,
which allowed in particular larger banks to replace interest income by fee income.
This development, however, goes along with higher risk taking mainly because of
the complexity of such instruments.
2 Review of literature
Diversification in banking can take on different dimensions. While there are a variety
of studies that analyze diversification within loan portfolio, diversification of income
sources, more specifically interest and non-interest income, has attracted increasing
attention in academic research. Generally, it is believed that diversification of income
sources should reduce total risk, as diversification should stabilize operating income
if income streams are negatively or imperfectly correlated. While this argument is
clear from a traditional point of view, DeYoung and Roland (2001) provide three rea-
sons why non-interest income may increase volatility. First, revenues from fee-based
activities might be more volatile than interest income because the customer-bank
relationship is stronger in the traditional lending business, i.e. for many of the new
fee-based activities it is easier for customers to switch to another bank. Second,
expanding into fee-based services can considerably increase fixed costs (e.g. by in-
vestments in technology and human resources) whereas, if a lending relationship
is already established, the only cost of an additional loan are the bank's interest
expenses. Third, in contrast to the lending business, fee-based activities require less
regulatory capital, which suggests a higher degree of financial leverage and therefore
leads to a higher earnings volatility. Indeed, DeYoung and Roland (2001) and Stiroh
(2004a) find empirical evidence that reliance on non-interest activities increases the
volatility of large U.S. banks. In general, only a few papers identify empirical evi-
dence that combined lending and non-interest activities cause diversification benefits
and therefore lead to risk reduction. By contrast, there are some studies (mainly for
the US banking market) that have shown a positive and significant influence of
diversification through non-interest income on earnings volatility.5
Stiroh (2004a) analyzes the potential benefit of income diversification for U.S.
banks. Since the growth of net interest and net non-interest income in the period
1984-2001 is increasingly correlated, he concludes that the diversification benefits
decreased during the period in question. Furthermore, he shows that at the bank
level risk-adjusted returns are negatively associated with non-interest income shares.

Stiroh (2004a).

De Young and Rice (2004) suggest that there are differences between the Euro-
pean and the U.S. banking sector. They argue that universal banking has been the
historic norm in many European banking systems, possibly based on experience as
European banks are better informed as to how to exploit the diversification benefit
of fee-based activities. Smith et al. (2003) likewise empirically confirm that Euro-
pean banks are able to seek diversification benefits through combining interest and
non-interest income activities. In the case of European banks, the authors find that
non-interest income is indeed more volatile than interest income but, in contrast
to U.S. studies, there are negative correlations between these two income streams.
Hence, they conclude that non-interest activities potentially stabilize bank earnings,
a result that is also confirmed by Davis and Tuori (2000) for a number of European
banks, including some in Germany.
Gischer and Jüttner (2003) find a weak negative relationship between ROA and
the fee income to interest income ratio for 19 OECD countries. The results for the
Australian banking sector are similar. Esho et al. (2005) show that for a sample
of Australian Credit Unions the return on assets (ROA) is negatively associated
with the increment of transaction fees. Against expectations, risk rises in line with
a higher revenue share of this income source. Conversely, revenue shares of fees
received for off-balance sheet facilities and fiduciary activities do not seem to have
any influence on risk and return, possibly on account of the relatively small share
of this income category. Lepetit et al. (2008) find that in the case of 602 European
banks during the period 1996-2002 there was a negative correlation between interest
margin and non-interest income. The authors assume that banks use loans as a loss
leader to expand their non-interest income via cross-selling.
Stiroh and Rumble (2006), Stiroh (2004b), Mercieca et al. (2007) and Chiorazzo
et al. (2008) differentiate between a "direct exposure" effect (a greater reliance on
non-interest activity) and an "indirect diversification effect" (change of concentration
between the two income streams), whereby the latter is measured by the Herfindahl
Hirschmann Index (HHI). Indeed, Stiroh and Rumble (2006), Stiroh (2004a) and
Mercieca et al. (2007) show that for small European banks, small U.S. community
banks and U.S. financial holding companies higher concentration is accompanied by
a lower degree of income volatility, while shifting into non-interest income creates an
inefficient trade-off between risk and return. Furthermore, all three studies conclude
that the banks' financial stability, measured through z-score, is negatively affected
by reliance on non-interest income. In contrast to these papers, Chiorazzo et al.
(2008) identify a positive relation between diversification and non-interest income
activity and risk-adjusted performance for Italian banks between 1993 and 2003.
Split samples, grouped by size classes, reveal that large banks, in particular, benefit
from non-interest income activities while within the group of small banks only in-
stitutions with a low non-interest income share are able to benefit from expanding
their non-interest business.
If, indeed, there are only two income streams the question remains, however, as
to whether the "direct exposure effect" can be separated from the "diversification
effect". In this context, Petersen (2004) complains that in the binary case, where
the bank chooses between lending and non-interest activities, the HHI is merely a
non-linear form of the non-interest income share. In particular, if the bank's non-
interest income share is less than 50%, which is true for most of the small banks,
3
the correlation between HHI and non-interest income share is extremely large and,
hence, empirically separating these two effects might be impossible.
Until now academic literature has paid only little attention to the fact that non-
interest activity and banks' performance are interrelated. On the one hand, there
is the suspicion that banks suffering from declining or highly volatile profitability
are inclined to expand their engagement in non-interest activities in order to earn a
higher or more stable return. On the other hand, shifting banks' business towards
non-interest income also has an impact on profitability.
In econometric analysis it is necessary to pay attention to the possible endo-
geneity of non-interest income activities, as otherwise the endogeneity of indepen-
dent variables leads to inconsistent estimators. Endogeneity in the modeling of non-
interest income is, for example, considered in De Young and Rice (2004), Laeven and
Levine (2005) and Campa and Kedia (2002), whereas all studies use an instrumental
variable approach to derive consistent estimators.
De Young and Rice (2004) demonstrate the empirical links between banks' non-
interest income, business strategies, market conditions, technological change and fi-
nancial performance for U.S. commercial banks between 1989 and 2001. They show
that well managed banks, measured by a relative ROE measure, are less engaged
in non-interest income while large banks and banks that focus more on relation-
ship banking are more reliant on non-interest income. They also find that marginal
increases in non-interest income engender higher, but more volatile profits, and a
decline in risk-adjusted profits. Craigwell and Maxwell (2006) also find a positive
impact of non-interest income on ROA and its volatility for Barbados banks between
1985 and 2001. In contrast to other studies, however, they find no evidence that rela-
tive performance helps to explain non-interest income. Surprisingly, in the Barbados
study non-interest income - in relative terms - plays a larger role for smaller banks.
While most previous work on bank diversification was dedicated to U.S. banks
there are only a few studies that analyze the relationship between the changing struc-
ture of bank income and risk in the European banking industry. To our knowledge,
no study exists that explicitly analyzes the effect of non-interest income activities
on German banks. In order to contribute to this area of banking literature, we ana-
lyze the effect of banks' fee generating activities on their risk-return profiles, with a
special emphasis on banks' interest margins. Our database consists of a micro panel
of supervisory balance sheet data and information on banks' lending to industry
sectors between 1995 to 2007. We focus on the problem of endogeneity in two ways:
first, we use a fixed effects panel with lagged variables to explain banks' return
and risk-adjusted return and, second, we apply the two-stage least squares estima-
tor to explain the volatility of bank returns. Our reasoning for this methodological
approach is described in detail in section 4.
In section 3 we review the reasons for fee-income growth over the last few years
while in section 4 we present a detailed data description and the empirical model.
Our results are reported by banking group in section 5 and our final conclusions are
contained in section 6.

3 Factors influencing banks' changing income and
profit structure
German interest margins have constantly been declining since the mid eighties. This
development has been accelerated by globalization but, on the other hand, global-
ization also leads to a rapid growth of international trade which in turn provides
opportunities in the fee business6 (Gischer and Jüttner, 2003). Hence, to compensate
for the adverse development in the interest business banks looked for other income
sources (Koetter et al., 2004). For some banks it has opened up new markets, partic-
ularly in trading, asset management and investment banking activities (Davis and
Tuori, 2000). The introduction of new regulatory requirements (Basel I and Basel
II) also impairs banks' non-interest income activities. Since regulatory requirements
have affected compliance and the cost of capital, banks have to look more closely
at different assets on their books and price them accordingly. In this context it
is often argued that the increase in off-balance sheet activities, which can be ob-
served in some European countries, largely results from lower capital requirements
for off-balance sheet items, and not from on-balance sheet activities.7
Moreover, lower risk-weights for inter-bank loans lead to an increase in this bal-
ance sheet position. Since inter-bank loans have lower interest margins than loans to
non-financial clients, non-interest income declined (Davis and Tuori, 2000). In addi-
tion, expanding consumer needs caused the creation of new types of bank activities.
In response to demographic changes, growing wealth on the part of individuals and
the expected loss in the pension system, a larger proportion of the population en-
gages in portfolio investments. Furthermore, there has been a change in technology
(e.g. automated teller machines and internet banking are now more common than
years ago) which also affects banks' cost structure (Hawtrey, 2003).
Finally, the costs of collecting and processing information have decreased. This
has, for example, lead to more efficient "production" of financial information and
better techniques for evaluating and pricing risk. Some banks have even specialized
in the monitoring of credit exposures (as agents rather than principals), e.g. in the
context of loan securitization which increases the share of non-interest income. Inno-
vation in financial products has facilitated a rearrangement of the income structure
and the balance sheet of banks. In general, the possibility of removing risk from cap-
ital has caused an increase in off-balance sheet activities, as some banks have been
encouraged to take part in the process of securitization by undertaking investment
banking activities (Davis and Tuori, 2000).
6E.g. letter of credit, international payment transfer, etc.
7Note that in Germany the off-balance sheet activities to total assets ratio rather decreased over
the last few years.

4 Variables, data and the empirical model
4.1 Measures of different income sources, diversification and
performance
In our analysis we consider a bank's total interest earnings (interest income, II ),
and total fee earnings (fee income, FI ), from which we create a variable SHFEE to
measure the share of fee generating activities:
SHFEE = (FI)/(FI + II)
As a profitability measure we consider return on equity (ROE) and total assets
(ROA), which is the ratio of operating revenues to equity and total assets respec-
tively. As risk measure we use the standard deviation () of ROE and ROA, which is
calculated over the entire period a bank is in the sample. Following Chiorazzo et al.
(2008) we construct risk-adjusted returns (RAROE and RAROA) to risk-adjust
profitability:
RAROEi
,t
= ROEi
,t
/ROEi
RAROAi
,t
= ROAi
,t
/ROAi
Interest margin (NIM) is calculated as interest surplus divided by total assets.
4.2 Data
For our empirical analysis we use data from the Bundesbank's prudential database
BAKIS (BAKred Information System), which incorporates information derived from
bank balance sheets and the supervisory reports of individual German banks. The
second data source for our analysis is the Bundesbank's borrowers' statistics, which
contain data about financial institutions' sectoral credit allocation. The third data-
base we use is the credit register for loans of 1.5 million euro or more. The credit
register gives us information to which regions banks gave loans of 1.5 million euro
or more. We use this data to construct a competition measure (COMP). We also
use the Deutsche Bundesbank MFI interest rate statistics. Our sample covers Ger-
man savings, cooperative and private banks but excludes Landesbanken, cooperative
central institutions, and the "Big Five" private banks. We also exclude affiliates of
German banks abroad, affiliates of foreign banks in Germany, mortgage banks and
special-purpose banks. Due to the restrictive nature of the data frequency we use
annual, bank-specific observations from 1995 to 2007.
Over the observed period many bank mergers took place in Germany. When
dealing with these mergers, we separate the merged bank from the two pre-merger
banks, i.e. we ultimately have three independent observations in our sample. In
order to avoid counting observations twice, we drop target banks in the year of
the merger. Furthermore, a relatively moderate outlier treatment is applied to the
dataset, in which we truncate selected variables, by banking group, at the 1st and
99th percentile. For commercial banks we truncate at the 2nd and 98th percentile,
since commercial banks are more heterogeneous. We also consider only banks with at
6
least three time-series observations in our regressions as this ensures a more reliable
measuring of banks' income variability. Finally, we apply both panel fixed-effects
and cross-sectional two-stage least squares models. For the latter specification we
average variables over time.
4.3 The empirical model
4.3.1 Performance and non-interest income
We use the following empirical specification to analyze the relationship between fee
income and profitability:
Yi,t
= k + t
+ i
+ 1
· SHFEEi,t-1
+ 2
· HHIi,t-1
+ 3
· NPLi,t-1
+ 4
· SIZEi,t-1
+ 5
· GROWTHi,t-1
+ 6
· LOANSi,t-1
+ 7
· EQUITYi,t-1
+ i,t
(1)
In the regression model k is a constant,  is a time fixed effect, and  is a bank
fixed effect. To account for endogeneity we lag regressors by one period. The variable
Y stands for ROE, ROA, RAROE, RAROA respectively.8
We use the following control variables:
1. HHI is the Herfindahl index for concentration in the banks' loan portfolios, i.e.
this index measures diversification in the interest earning business. We differentiate
between nine sectors: (1) agricultural, forestry and fishing products, (2) services, (3)
manufacturing industry, (4) building sector, (5) housing market, (6) trade, mainte-
nance and repair of motor vehicles, (7) deferred payment credits and non-deferred
payment credits, (8) energy, water supply and mining, (9) communications services.
2. NPL is the share of non-performing loans relative to customer loans. This ratio
measures risk in the credit portfolio.
3. SIZE is the natural logarithm of banks' total assets in million euro. We use
this variable to capture bank size. Larger banks have more resources to build up
know how and technologies for high-quality risk-management. Furthermore, a larger
size allows the bank to exploit economies of scale. Small banks, on the other hand,
might take advantage of the greater flexibility (Chiorazzo et al., 2008).
4. GROWTH is the growth rate of banks' total deflated assets. On the one hand
this variable reflects a bank's growing business opportunities. On the other hand,
however, it may also be viewed as a proxy for bank managers' preference for risk
taking, assuming that risk-loving managers usually prefer fast growth.
5. EQUITY is the ratio of equity to total assets and describes the degree of
total financial leverage. This variable also represents a proxy for bank managers'
8Following Chiorazzo et al. (2008) we analyze the effects on RAROE and RAROA in a fixed
effects framework, although volatility is time invariant. Interpreting the results one has to bear
in mind that part of the risk-adjustment is absorbed by the fixed effects.
7
risk aversion, since risk averse bank managers tend to keep more equity than risk
loving managers.
6. LOANS is the ratio of loans to total assets and is also a proxy for bank
managers' risk aversion, assuming that a high degree of capitalization signals a high
risk aversion and vice versa.
4.3.2 Risk and fee income
The ROE (ROA) standard deviation ROE
(ROA
) is explained in cross-sectional
regressions, using the same covariates as in the fixed-effects panel regressions with
dependent variables ROE (ROA) and risk-adjusted ROE (ROA). Since ROE
(ROA
)
is calculated from annual panel data all of the explanatory variables are averaged
over time (indicated by bars over the variables). Following Stiroh (2004b) we also
include year dummies (YEAR) to capture time trends and unobservable macroeco-
nomic effects.9

In the first stage we add three variables as excluded instruments: COMMER-
CIAL, SERVICE, and DEPOSITS. As proposed by DeYoung and Rice (2004) we
include COMMERCIAL, the ratio of commercial and industrial loans relative to to-
tal loans. We assume that the cross-selling potential in the fee business is higher for
banks serving a larger share of commercial customers. SERVICE is a measure of ser-
vice intensity, assuming that banks with higher service capacity have more resources
to perform fee-generating activities. We create SERVICE by dividing the number of
full-time employees by deflated loan volume. DEPOSITS is the ratio of demand de-
posits, term deposits, and time deposits relative to total assets. This ratio is a proxy
for traditional relationship banking, assuming that there is a certain cross-selling
potential to the respective clients holding deposits (De Young and Rice, 2004). To
summarize, all our instruments proxy a bank's ability to engage in the fee business
through customer relations, service capacities and cross-selling opportunities.
9Note that we base our study on an unbalanced panel as (mainly because of mergers) not all
banks can be observed over the whole sample period 1995 - 2007.
10For the sake of consistency in the second stage of the model we do not use a tobit specification
in the first stage (Angrist and Krueger, 2001).

4.3.3 Fee income and interest margins
In this section we examine the link between banks' interest rate setting and the shift
towards fee generating activities. From the latter we would expect opportunities in
the interest business, i.e. for the cross-selling of loans. We employ a dealership-
based model of the bank which allows us to derive the determinants of the interest
margin (Ho and Saunders, 1981). In this model banks are considered risk-averse
intermediaries between lenders and borrowers. In doing so, banks are exposed to
competitive pressures, as well as interest rate and credit risk which determine their
interest margins. As proposed by Maudos and Fernández de Guevara (2004) we
additionally control for managerial efficiency measured by the cost-income ratio,
assuming that less efficient banks are obliged to charge higher margins. A bank's
net interest margin (NIM) is defined by total interest income minus total interest
expenses. The model setup is as follows:

1. R3M is the 3-month interbank rate (EURIBOR)11. R3M is expected to have
a positive effect on NIM, since the interest spread is expected to widen with in-
creasing interest rates. Furthermore an increase in the risk-free rate implies higher
opportunity costs.
2. BDR is a measure of borrower default risk, which is either presented by the
ratio of loan loss provisions relative to customer loans (LLP) or by the share of
non-performing loans relative to customer loans (NPL).
3. EQUITY is the ratio of equity to total assets. This variable has two inter-
pretations: first, it is a proxy for the degree of banks' risk aversion and, second, it
accounts for the effect of leverage on risk levels and the required risk premium.
4. COMP is a Herfindahl index for regional market concentration based on lend-
ing data from the Bundesbank credit register. The index is calculated as the average
concentration across banks in each state ("Bundesland"), weighted by the bank's loan
exposure in the state. The higher the share of COMP, the greater the concentration
in this state and vice versa.12
5. CIR is the cost-income ratio, calculated as operating expenses relative to gross
income. The literature provides mixed results on the expected coefficients. On the
one hand, a lowering in the cost structure should decrease interest rate margins.
On the other hand, screening and monitoring of borrowers require higher personnel
costs, which could also result in an increase of CIR and a lowering in default risk
premium charged on loans.
From a theoretical point of view, the average transaction size positively influences
the interest margin. Since this variable can not be computed from our data, and is
11Before 1998 FIBOR.
12Notice that the credit register reports exposures above 1.5 million Euro which leads to a certain
bias towards large banks in this measure for regional market concentration.

also ignored in most of the other studies13, we also disregard this indicator. In an
extended version of the model we interact credit risk with the fee-income share. By
including this indicator we test how credit pricing, assuming given credit risk, varies
according to banks' share of fee business. This interpretation only holds provided
fees are charged at an identical flat, meaning that the same conditions apply for any
customer, or if fees are not risk dependent.
5 Regression results
5.1 Return and risk-adjusted return in the fee business
Table 1 reports the statistics for fixed-effects regressions by banking group. For each
savings, cooperative, and commercial banks the share of fee earnings (FEE) has a
positive and significant coefficient for risk-adjusted return on equity (RAROE) and
risk-adjusted return on total assets (RAROA). Furthermore, in the ROE and ROA
regressions the coefficient on FEE is also positive and significant for commercial and
cooperative banks. These results are in line with Chiorazzo et al. (2008) and Smith
et al. (2003) but differ from U.S. studies like those of Stiroh and Rumble (2006) and
De Young and Rice (2004). Since universal banking has been the historic norm in
Germany as well as many European Countries, these banks may be more experienced
in generating fee income and exploiting diversification benefits (De Young and Rice,
2004).
We also record some interesting results regarding bank size. While private banks
appear to gain from economies of scale, in the case of savings and cooperative banks
size is negatively correlated with returns.14 This finding might be explained by the
role of small cooperative and savings banks in rural areas, where they face less com-
petition than bigger savings and cooperative banks face in urban areas. Commercial
banks, in contrast, operate mainly in urban areas with a higher potential to exploit
economies of scale.
The banking groups also differ in terms of the effects of bank growth on the share
of fee business. While for commercial banks ROE (ROA) and RAROE (RAROA)
are not affected by growth, for savings and cooperative banks we find a positive
association. Moreover, the positive sign on HHI suggests that ROE (ROA) and
RAROE (RAROA) increase in line with a more concentrated loan portfolio. This
may be due to the fact that small German banks are able to generate benefits from
their core lending activities. This result is in line with Hayden et al. (2006) and Behr
et al. (2007) who also find diseconomies of scope in the German banking sector. Such
diseconomies can arise if a bank has insufficient monitoring expertise in new lending
activities. The small number of significant coefficients on commercial banks result
from the heterogeneity within this banking group.
13See for example Gischer and Jüttner (2003) and Lepetit et al. (2008).
14Hayden et al. (2006) and Behr et al. (2007) also find negative correlations between size and
return in a sample which is mainly dominated by cooperative banks.

5.2 Risk in the fee business
Risk is measured by the ROE (ROA) standard deviation () and is explained in two-
stage least squares regressions. "Good instruments" for FEE should be both relevant
and valid, i.e. the instruments should be correlated with the endogenous repressors
and, at the same time, be orthogonal to the residuals (Baum et al., 2003).One rule of
thumb is that the F-statistic of excluded instruments should not be less than 10. If
there are at least two instruments, overidentification restrictions can be tested with
Hansen's J-Test (Sargan's statistic), where rejection of the null hypothesis suggests
that at least one instrument is not exogenous (Wooldridge, 2003). In our regressions
the conditions for relevant and valid instruments are satisfied. All instruments are
significant, except for COMMERCIAL in the group of commercial banks. The F-
statistic of excluded instruments is above 10. Furthermore, a comparison with Staiger
and Stocks' critical values shows that the bias of IV-estimation is below 5 percent
of the bias of OLS estimation. Hansen's J-statistics indicate that exogeneity can not
be rejected at the 10% level. The results by banking group for the first-stage are
reported in table 2.15
First, while for savings and commercial banks loan quality does not play a role in
the first-stage regressions, cooperative banks that face a higher loan quality are more
active in the fee business. The negative relationship seems to be reasonable as banks
under good management should enjoy a higher loan quality and, at the same time,
be better at generating fee income. Second, the negative sign on LOANS denotes
that banks with intermediation-based strategies rely on interest income generating
activities rather than on fee business. Third, bank size does not affect FEE for
commercial and savings banks; larger cooperative banks, however, are more engaged
in fee-based activities than smaller ones. We anticipated this sign, since larger banks
have a greater capacity to generate fee income. Fourth, cooperative and savings
banks differ with respect to the coefficient on loan portfolio diversification. More
specialized savings banks exhibit a higher share of fee earnings, possibly because
they offer precisely compatible products for their customers and have better cross-
selling opportunities. On the other hand, cooperative banks with diversified loan
portfolios are increasingly engaged in the fee business, too, possibly based on a
comprehensive, bank-wide diversification strategy. Fifth, commercial and savings
banks that hold a higher amount of equity per unit assets are more concentrated
in the interest business. Banks with little interest income can afford to hold less
equity as a bank's balance sheet is mainly affected by interest-generating activities.
As with savings banks in our regressions, EQUITY could be negatively associated
with SHFEE, as fee-generating activities require less regulatory capital.
The coefficients of the second-stage regression are presented in table 3. Here we
find ROE (ROA) volatility is only significant for the commercial banks group. The
positive coefficient implies that an increase in the share of fee income destabilizes
profitability, i.e. ROE
(ROA
) increases. For savings and cooperative banks we find
no significant influence on ROE (ROA) volatility. The different findings for banking
15In the case of savings and cooperative banks, the first stage is identical for both ROE and
ROA regressions as they are based on the same sample. For private banks we include one
more observation in the regression on ROA than we have in the regression on ROE. Since this
observation does not lead to relevant changes, we tabulate only the ROE regression for the
first stage.

groups can be explained by the fact that commercial banks are already much more
involved in fee business than savings and cooperative banks. Assuming that banks
perform risk-return oriented ABC analyses to evaluate opportunities in the fee busi-
ness, an already high level of fee business implies additional C-class engagements, as
A/B-class opportunities are already exhausted. Hence, for commercial banks, risk
increases in line with expanded in fee-generating activities. Another explanation is
that commercial banks run other types of fee-business than savings and cooperative
banks. While savings and cooperatives tend to have fees from insurance etc., more
volatile lines of fee-business matter for private banks, e.g. asset management and
loan securitization.
As the results in section 5.1 indicate the increase in ROE (ROA) volatility is out-
weighed by the increase in ROE (ROA). Hence, the fee income share positively in-
fluences risk-adjusted return, i.e. the coefficient of SHFEE is positive in the RAROE
(RAROA) regressions.
With regard to loan portfolio diversification, we also record different results
across banking groups from the two-stage least squares regressions. According to
portfolio theory returns should be more volatile for banks with specialized loan
portfolios; as far as cooperative banks are concerned this theorem is confirmed by
our analysis. Finally, we find that well capitalized banks and banks with less risky
loan portfolios enjoy more stable returns. 16
16Robustness checks are performed. First we use a tobit model in the first stage. Second we include
a variable "number of years in the sample", to account for the case that a bank which is observed
for a shorter time horizon would have a higher volatility of return. The results remain stable.

5.3 Interest margin and non-interest income
In the income diversification literature we uncover evidence of a relationship be-
tween banks' non-interest activities and their loan pricing. This relationship is jus-
tified by possible cross-subsidization (or cross-selling) effects, as banks might just
charge a lower interest margin when they expect increased revenues from fees and
commissions in the non-interest business (Lepetit et al., 2008). To analyze possible
cross-subsidization effects between interest and fee income in the German banking
industry we specify a bank loan pricing model. In this model we explain banks'
net interest margins (interest income minus interest expenses) using a vector of
prevailing variables in the literature to specify this kind of model. Table 4 shows
the results from the fixed effects panel regressions by banking group. As expected,
the fee income variable (SHFEE) has a significant negative coefficient suggesting
possible cross-selling of lending and fee generating activities. In order to detail this
finding we control for the interaction of fee income and credit risk, where the latter
is measured by non-performing loans (NPL) and loan loss provisions (LLP). While
we obtain only for the group of cooperative banks significant results for the first
credit risk variable, the LLP · SHFEE interaction term indicates a lower interest
margin for savings and commercial banks, given LLP, when the share of fee in-
come increases. In other words, we find that savings and commercial banks charge
a lower risk premium for a given level of borrower default risk (measured by LLP),
when they are more engaged in fee generating activities. In summary, we find that
institutions from those two banking groups underprice credit risk when they have
additional opportunities to generate income from fees and commissions and inter-
pret this finding as an indication of some cross-subsidization (or cross-selling) effects
between interest and fee business.17
17Cross-subsidization effects should be examined in more detail by explaining loan-specific pricing.
In the supervisory balance sheet data for Germany, however, interest margins as well as fees
and commissions can only be calculated as bank averages, a limitation that is also mentioned
in the paper of Lepetit et al. (2008).
14
The remaining control variables also confirm expected signs. A higher credit risk,
measured by LLP, is associated with larger interest margins. Also, higher money
market rates increase interest margins, as opportunity costs rise. As stated in sub-
section 4.3.3, theoretically coefficients on CIR can have different signs. While the
sign on CIR is negative for commercial banks, the impact is positive for coopera-
tive banks and insignificant for savings banks. Market concentration plays a role in
the cases of cooperative and savings banks because, as one would expect, institu-
tions which operate in more concentrated markets charge higher interest margins.
Finally, as EQUITY focuses on the effect of leverage on risk levels and the required
risk premium its coefficients are strongly significant for all banking groups.

6 Conclusion
In this study we focus on the primary income sources of banks: interest and fee
business. Our database is a micro panel of supervisory balance sheet data (BAKIS)
and information about banks' lending to industry sectors (borrowers' statistics) for
the years 1995 to 2007. An essential aspect of our analysis is the treatment of en-
dogeneity between banks' risk-return-characteristics and their activity in fee income
generating operations. For the treatment of endogeneity we specify two models: one
is a fixed-effects panel model with regressors lagged by one year and, the second is
a two-stage least squares estimator. The latter approach also allows us to analyze
the factors determining a banks' participation in the fee income business.
In our analysis, we show that banks with a large share of fee income exhibit
a more favorable risk-return profile, i.e. they enjoy a higher risk-adjusted return
on equity (ROE) and total assets (ROA). Additionally, we find that for commer-
cial banks strong involvement in the fee business is accompanied by higher ROE-
and ROA-volatility and, therefore, with increased risk. In particular for commercial
banks some fee income activities are associated with much higher risks than other
income sources and, therefore, they could contribute to destabilize both individual
banks as well as the whole banking system.
In the regression statistics we show that both return measures, ROE and ROA,
show robust results, not only in the fixed effects panel models but also in the two-
stage least squares estimator.
The second part of the paper focuses on banks' interest margins. In order to ana-
lyze possible cross-subsidization effects between interest and fee business we specify
a bank loan pricing model. In this model we explain banks' net interest margins (in-
terest income minus interest expenses) by a vector of variables which are standard
for this kind of model specification. Here we find that for savings and commercial
banks institutions with a strong focus on fee business charge lower interest margins
when credit risk is controlled by loan loss provisions. The examination of cross-
subsidization effects, however, is limited by data constraints, as for Germany loan-
specific interest rates are not available, i.e. interest margins can only be calculated
as bank averages.
