Abstract
Recent research has shown that the typical Supplemental Food Assistance Program (SNAP) family falls short in meeting
the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) nutritional guidelines that underlie the SNAP even when they typically have sufficient monetary
resources to eat a healthful diet (i.e. to follow the TFP recommendations). However, the TFP does not consider labor cost.
This study uses a basic labor economics technique to value labor in a home food production scenario that is required to
reach the TFP nutrition and budget targets and calculates the total cost (inclusive of labor) associated with the TFP. This
TFP consistent total cost is then compared, using several metrics, with the total cost associated with actual choices made
by those families sharing the same profiles as current SNAP participants. Once labor is included, we find the TFP is not
very thrifty and the mean household falls short of the TFP guidelines even with adequate monetary resources. J. Nutr.

Introduction
The Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)5 is a key component in determining
the amount of money available to participants in the Supple-
mental Food Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly the Food
Stamp Program. As stated by the USDA, the TFP "serves as a
national standard for a nutritious diet at a minimal cost
[emphasis added] and is used as the basis for food stamp
allotments" (1). The TFP is essentially a nonlinear mathematical
programming model that is used to provide a diet pattern
recommendation along with the associated monetary cost that
meets the "national standard for a nutritious diet" (1) for food
prepared at home. Unfortunately, the TFP does not consider
food preparation time and therefore implicitly assumes time is
an unlimited (free) resource. Of course time (labor) is not
unlimited and is a crucial input in food production at home.
The typical SNAP family falls short of meeting the TFP
nutritional guidelines even when the family typically has
sufficient monetary resources to eat a healthful diet (i.e. to
follow the TFP recommendations) (2,3). The central question is:
Why? Though there are likely several reasons, we consider a
basic economic explanation. Introductory economics indicates
that in producing any type of output, such as a nutritious meal,
individuals will look for the least cost input combination to
achieve that output (4). Ignoring an important input (such as
labor) in the cost comparison calculation will underestimate the
real cost of the inputs. The question we then seek to answer is:
how thrifty is the TFP once we include labor cost?
Recent research has supported the fact that ignoring the labor
cost will underestimate the total cost required to reach the TFP
nutrition target (5,6). However, these studies did not directly
answer to what extent the labor cost will affect the effectiveness
of the TFP. To directly answer that question, we used a basic
labor economics technique to value the labor in a home food
production scenario that is required to reach the TFP nutrition
and budget targets and calculate the total cost (inclusive of
labor) associated with the TFP. This TFP total cost is then
compared in several different ways with the total cost associated
with actual choices made by those families sharing the same
profiles as current SNAP participants. Once labor was included,
we found the TFP is not very thrifty. Consequently, considering
the total cost of food, it may not be too surprising that
households fall short of the TFP guidelines even with "ade-
quate" monetary resources.
With 2 main inputs (food and labor), the total cost of
producing a homemade meal for the entire household is the sum
of food monetary costs (M) and labor time costs (T), or
TC ¼ M þ T ¼ pF
F þ pL
L ¼ M þ pL
L; ð1Þ
where TC is the total cost of producing a homemade meal for the
whole household, pF
is the price of food, F is the quantity of
food, pL
is the price of labor in food production, and L is the
amount of labor time involved in food production. Because we
generally observe the total food monetary expenditure (M) and
can find measurements for price of labor and time (pL
, L), we
will use the last equality in Eq. 1 to perform the analysis.

Several manipulations of Eq. 1 provide numerous useful
evaluation metrics. First, evaluating Eq. 1 at the actual money
and labor combinations (MActual
, LActual
) gives the actual total
cost TCActual
. Similarly, evaluating Eq. 1 at the money and labor
combination required to reach the TFP (MTFP
, LTFP
) gives the
TFP total cost TCTFP
. Note Eq. 1 shows that there are numerous
possible input combinations that could yield the same total cost,
so just because a family is not following the TFP input levels (F
or L) does not imply the household is spending more or less than
the total cost associated with the TFP.
Second, the cost shares for food and labor are: sF
= M 4 TC
and sL
= pL
L 4 TC, respectively. Calculating input cost shares
using Eq. 1 will shed light on the distribution of the 2 input costs:
if the TFP equivalent cost shares for labor is much larger than the
actual choices made by the household (sL
TFP . sL
Actual), it
indicates that the TFP requirement is more labor intensive.
In addition, to measure the excess (deficit) a family is
spending relative to that required by the TFP, one could take the
ratio of actual total cost to total cost associated with the TFP (i.e.
TCActual
4 TCTFP
). If this ratio is .1, then the household is
spending more than enough to meet the TFP requirement of the
total cost. Of course if one assumes there is no labor cost
involved, this ratio reduces to the ratio of food expenditures
(MActual
4 MTFP
) and this ratio could be very different from the
total cost ratio if labor cost is sizable (i.e. the cost share of labor
sL
is large). This food expenditure ratio may be .1, indicating
the family is spending more than enough to meet the TFP,
whereas the total cost ratio could be ,1, indicating the family
is not spending enough (i.e. MTFP
, MActual
does not imply
TCTFP
, TCActual
).
Finally, to answer a question such as: "What is the maximum
labor time needed that will still make the TFP total cost thrifty
(i.e. TCTFP
# TCActual
)?" we use this inequality to determine the
upper limit on labor time (L) required that would make the TFP
total cost less than the actual total cost while keeping food
expenditure amount (M) unchanged. This upper limit on labor is
LU
TFP
# (MActual
­ MTFP
)/pL
+ LActual
. A similar question can be
answered for the maximum food expenditure needed to satisfy
the same inequality (TCTFP
# TCActual
), holding the amount of
labor constant, and this upper money limit is MU
TFP
# MActual
+
pL
(LActual
­ LTFP
). The U superscript on both conditions
indicates the upper bound. The summary of the metrics formula
discussed in this section is provided (Table 1).
To calculate these various metrics requires household level
data on actual food expenditures (MActual
) and labor time in
food production (LActual
), TFP consistent food monetary expen-
ditures (MTFP
), labor in food production (LTFP
), and the price of
labor in food production (pL
). We limited the analysis to single-
headed households, because these households comprise the
majority of SNAP participants (7). We mapped the data sources
with the components in the TC formula (Fig. 1). For calculating
the actual monetary and time amounts (MActual
, LActual
), 2
datasets sampled from the same subset of the Current Popula-
tion Survey (CPS) were linked by unique household identifiers:
the 2004­2007 Food Security Supplement (FSS) and 2005­2008
American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Two published USDA
documents were used for the amount of food expenditure and
time required to meet the TFP goals (MTFP
, LTFP
). The amount of
money associated with the TFP (MTFP
) depends on the actual
household composition (e.g. household members and ages) and
the above merged data from FSS and ATUS provided sufficient
household composition information for us to assign the TFP
food monetary expenditure amounts to appropriate households.
The price of labor (pL
) comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS).
The actual food monetary expenditure and labor time
(MActual
, LActual
) components were calculated from a data set
merging the FSS and the ATUS. Both FSS and ATUS are subsets
of the CPS. The CPS is a monthly labor force survey of ;60,000
households conducted by the Census Bureau for the BLS. Once
each year, after answering the labor force questions from the
CPS, the same households are asked a series of questions about
food security, food expenditures, and use of food and nutrition
assistance programs and this information is the core content of
the FSS. The actual food monetary expenditures observed
(MActual
) are "usual" weekly household food expenditures
reported in the FSS.
The actual labor time (LActual
) comes from the ATUS. The
ATUS households are chosen from the CPS households that
completed their 8th (final) interview. The ATUS contains
demographic, hourly wage rate, and time use information. The
ATUS collects individual time allocation data from a designated
person about his or her activities the previous day. The ATUS
households are stratified by race, ethnicity, and the presence of
children and are selected to ensure nationally representability.
The ATUS sample is randomized by day with 50% of the sample
reporting weekday activities and 50% reporting Saturday and
Sunday activities. We considered 6 categories of time in ATUS
that contribute to household food production: Food and Drink
Preparation (ATUS Code 020201), Food Presentation (ATUS
Code 020202), Kitchen and Food Clean-up (ATUS Code
020203), Grocery Shopping (ATUS Code 070101), and Travel
Related to Food and Drink Preparation, Clean-up, and Presen-
tation (ATUS Code 180202).
The TFP-required amounts on food monetary expenditure
and time components in the TC formula (MActual
, LActual
) come
from 2 USDA published documents (8,9).
The USDA food plan report provides weekly TFP food costs
for individuals by gender and age categories (8). Therefore, the
TFP equivalent household food expenditures (MTFP
) vary by
household compositions. The merged data from FSS and ATUS
contain information on age and gender for each household
member. This information enabled us to calculate the MTFP
for
each household in our sample by summing the age-gender­
specific individual costs and then multiplying by a scale
adjustment as described in the footnotes of the USDA report
tables (8).
As indicated, the TFP does not take into account labor, so
estimates of the amount of labor associated with the TFP (LTFP
)
are a little more tenuous. However, in 2000 the USDA Center for
Nutrition Policy and Promotion published Recipes and Tips for
Healthy, Thrifty Meals (9). As stated in this USDA document,

"The menus presented here conform to the recommendations
contained in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the
USDA Food guide Pyramid" (9). This USDA publication
contains 40 recipes and the associated amount of time needed
for food preparation and cooking, which were used to form the
estimate of LTFP
.
The last component in both the TFP and the actual
measurements is the value of labor time in food production.
There are 2 ways in the labor economics literature to measure
the value of time: the opportunity cost approach and the market
substitute approach (10). In this study, we used the market
substitute approach, which values the household labor at the
rate that the same activity could be purchased on the market.
The market substitute price (pL
) we used is the median hourly
wage rate from the 6-digit standard occupational classification
for private household cooks collected by the BLS for 2004­
2007: $9.37, $10.01, $11.00, and $11.67, respectively (11). As
Gronau (10) indicated, the market substitute approach tends to
produce a lower value of labor than the opportunity cost
approach. This appears to be the case in this application as well.
Using the ATUS 2003 data within the opportunity cost of time
approach, Davis and You (6) estimated the shadow value of food
production time at ~$14.00/h for a similar population.
There are a few empirical implementation hurdles that must
be explained and confronted. First, food expenditures in FSS are
reported on a weekly basis, but time expenditures in ATUS are
reported on a daily basis. Because all days of the week are
represented in the ATUS sampling process, we exploited this
information and used a Horovitz-Thompson type estimator to
estimate total weekly time for each individual (12). This
Horovitz-Thompson type procedure uses the sample mean for
days of the week when the individual was not sampled coupled
with their reported time for the day they were sampled to
generate a weekly time estimate. Because of the stratified
sampling design, the final sampling weights will be used in all
calculations.
Second, a sample 2-wk meal plan for a family of 4 based on
these 40 recipes is given in the USDA Recipes and the mean
weekly food preparation time in this plan is 16 h/d or 2.28 h/d
(9). Obviously, other recipe combinations and therefore labor
requirements are possible from these 40 recipes. To gauge the
sensitivity of the results, we cut this estimate in half and present
the results for 2 cases: LTFP
= 16, LTFP
= 8.
Third, there are perhaps concerns about scale effects for the
other inputs (MActual
, TActual
, and TTFP
) similar to that for MTFP
,
where values are adjusted for family size. Scaling is as much an
art as a science and specific values are difficult to justify. If the
data are already at the household level, such as actual food
expenditures (MActual
), then no scaling is required. This leaves
the possible need to scale TActual
and TTFP
. As a reviewer points
out, the time in food preparation is probably rather constant by
family size. Furthermore, we worked with single-headed house-
holds, so it would seem reasonable to assume this individual is
the main food preparer and the reported actual time (TActual
) is
the household time. With respect to the TFP time estimate
(TTFP
), although the time estimate may vary by family size, we
believe there is more variation due to alternative combinations
of recipes that could constitute a weekly meal plan. In either
case, this is another reason for conducting the sensitivity analysis
discussed above.
In addition to limiting the analysis to single-headed house-
hold, we trimmed the top 1% of observations from our data in
terms of actual money expenditures and time expenditures to
minimize the influence of outliers. There were then 6331
households used in the final analysis.
We present the results of the analysis for the 2 levels of labor
consistent with the TFP (i.e. LTFP
= 16, LTFP
= 8) to gauge the
sensitivity of the results (Table 2). All summary statistics used
sampling weights inherent in the FSS-ATUS data. Regardless of
the value of LTFP
used, the mean total cost (i.e. average across
different household compositions) associated with the TFP is
higher than the mean actual total cost. The mean total cost of
homemade meals is ;$20/wk more if the labor requirement to

meet the TFP is 8 h/wk but is $100/wk more if this labor
requirement is 16 h/wk. Not too surprisingly, actual total cost
has a larger SD and a wider 99% percentile interval than the TFP
total cost, which means actual consumer behaviors vary greatly
from household to household. A comparison of the mean cost
shares indicates that the TFP consistent input combination is
much more labor intensive than the actual input combination
that households choose (i.e. sL
TFP . sL
Actual), because we used the
same value of labor time in both components. In fact, the cost
shares are almost exactly opposite between the TFP and actual
total cost. Just averaging between the 2 labor requirement
scenarios (i.e. LTFP
= 16, LTFP
= 8), the TFP cost share for food is
;40% and for labor is ;60%; this labor cost share is consistent
with Davis and You's finding (6). In contrast, the actual cost
share for food is ;60% and ;40% for labor.
The mean actual-to-TFP food expenditure ratio indicates that
if labor cost is completely ignored, then the mean household
more than adequately meets the TFP cost requirement. The
mean household spends 34% more in actual spending compared
with what is required by the TFP. Alternatively, if labor cost is
included, the actual-to-total cost ratio indicates that at the mean
households spend 10% less than enough to meet the TFP cost
requirement, if the labor required in the TFP is 8 h/wk. If the
amount of labor required to meet the TFP is 16 h/wk, then at the
mean households spend 40% less than enough to meet the TFP
cost requirement. Of course, as is to be expected and as indicated
by the SD and 99% percentile interval, there were households
for each measure that did spend enough resources to meet the
TFP for the total cost ratio, but not at the mean.
Finally, there is likely interest in what is the maximum food
expenditure (MU
TFP
) or labor (LU
TFP
) one could spend, holding
the other constant, that keeps the TFP total cost lower than the
actual total cost (i.e. TCTFP
# TCActual
). If the labor requirement
to meet the TFP is 8 h/wk, at the mean the upper bound on food
expenditures is $69.61, but if the labor requirement is increased
to 16 h/wk then the mean upper bound must be a negative
$14.58. This is to be expected, because as the labor cost
increases (with number of hours increasing), the food expendi-
tures must decrease to hold total cost constant. The fact that this
upper bound becomes negative reflects the importance of labor
cost in the total cost calculations. The 99% percentile interval
indicates this upper food expenditure has a rather wide range
and reflects the fact that some households may be closer and
some farther away from the TFP labor requirement. Perhaps of
most interest for policy makers is the upper bound on labor
input required by TFP to make the TFP thrifty (i.e. TCTFP
#
TCActual
). At the mean, this upper bound is 6.41 h/wk. This
means that if policy makers want the input combination that is
cost competitive with actual input allocations, the labor
requirement for the TFP can be no more than 6.41 h/wk. Note
this is over 2 h less than the lower estimate of 8 h/wk implied by
Davis and You (6) and is over 10 h/wk less than that implied by
the sample weekly menus provided in the USDA document (9).
These sizable gaps indicate the need to consider time in
intervention and food assistance program designs.
This analysis indicates that the TFP is not very thrifty once
labor cost is included. This fact provides a disincentive to adhere
to the TFP and the accompanying food guidelines and helps
explain why many households do not come close to the dietary
guidelines associated with the TFP. Just considering food
expenditures in isolation (i.e. ignoring labor cost) can give a
very distorted picture in terms of resources adequate to reach the
TFP requirement. Though there is certainly some uncertainty
with respect to the amount of labor required to adhere to the
TFP, the existing estimates indicate that the TFP requirement is
very labor intensive and this labor intensity is what drives the
results. Future work needs to obtain more precise estimates of
the actual labor amount needed to meet the TFP, but, as was
shown, to make the total cost of the TFP competitive with
actual total cost will require the labor associated with the TFP to
be no greater than ;6 h/wk. One simple and practical policy
solution is to develop more labor-efficient recipes that satisfy the
TFP.
