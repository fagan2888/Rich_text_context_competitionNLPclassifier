Introduction
The Mueller/McCloskey Nurse Job Satisfaction Scale
(MMSS) is a commonly used measure of nurses' job satis-
faction (Mueller & McCloskey, 1990). McCloskey (1974)
developed a precursor to the MMSS to study the influence of
incentives and rewards on staff nurse turnover rates. For each
of 36 items categorized according to Maslow's (1954) hier-
archy of needs and insights of Burns (1969), staff nurses
were asked to indicate which rewards, if available, would
have influenced them to remain in the job they left in the
previous 4 months. Mueller and McCloskey (1990) con-
ducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on 33 of the 36
items and retained the 31 items that have since constituted
the MMSS-31 (Table 1).
Mueller and McCloskey (1990) recommended that inves-
tigators use the MMSS-31 as a general measure of nurse sat-
isfaction when they have no interest in determining how nurse
satisfaction is influenced by particular job or work setting
characteristics. When a finer grained understanding of nurse
job satisfaction is required, Cronbach's alpha values .7 sug-
gest that four of the eight sub-dimensions identified by
Mueller and McCloskey are sufficiently internally consistent
to achieve productive measurement (scheduling satisfaction,
six items, Cronbach's =
.84; interaction, three items,
Cronbach's =.72;praise/recognition,fouritems,Cronbach's
 = .80; control/responsibility, five items, Cronbach's  =
.80). Mueller and McCloskey advised investigators to include
independent questions on the importance of job satisfaction
components if they are interested in which aspects of their
work nurses believe are more salient to their job satisfaction.
Their rationale was that there is little point in employers

Rasch Measurement Analysis of a 25-Item
Version of the Mueller/McCloskey Nurse
Job Satisfaction Scale in a Sample of
Nurses in Lebanon and Qatar
Michael Clinton1, Nuhad Yazbik Dumit1, and Fadi El-Jardali1
Abstract
The Mueller/McCloskey Nurse Job Satisfaction Scale (MMSS) is widely used, but its psychometric characteristics have not
been sufficiently validated for use in Middle Eastern countries. The objective of our methodological study was to determine
the psychometric suitability of a 25-item version of the MMSS (MMSS-25) for use in middle-income and high-income Middle
Eastern countries. A total of 1,322 registered nurses, 859 in Lebanon and 463 in Qatar, completed the MMSS-25 as part
of a cross-sectional multinational investigation of nursing shortages in the region. We used the Rasch rating scale model
to investigate the psychometric performance of the MMSS-25. We identified possible item bias among MMSS-25 items.
We conducted confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to compare the fit to our data of five factor structures reported in the
literature. We concluded that irrespective of administration in English or Arabic, the MMSS-25 is not sufficiently productive
of measurement for use in the region. A core set of 13 items (MMSS-13, Cronbach's  = .82) loading on five dimensions
eliminates redundant MMSS items and is suitable for initial screening of nurses' satisfaction. Of the five factor structures
we examined, the MMSS-13 was the only close fit to our data (comparative fit index = 0.951; Tucker­Lewis index = 0.931;
root mean square error of approximation = 0.051; p value = .401). The MMSS-13 has psychometric characteristics superior
to MMSS-25, but additional items are required to meet the research-specific objectives of future studies of nurses' job
satisfaction in Middle Eastern countries.

trying to improve nurses' job satisfaction unless they under-
stand what nurses themselves regard as important.
Although the MMSS-31 has been used in North America
(McCloskey & McCain, 1987; Wilson, Squires, Widger,
Cranley, & Tourangeau (2008), O'Brien-Pallas, Murphy,
Shamain, Xiaoqiang, & Hayes (2010), Hickson (2013),
McGilton, Tourangeau, Kavcic, & Wodchis (2013), and
other countries Gurková et al. (2013), Gurková, Haroková,
Dzuka, & Ziaková (2014), Babiarczyk, Fras, Ulman-
Wlodarz, & Jarosova (2014), Tourangeau, McGillis Hall,
Doran, and Petch (2006) could not replicate the eight-factor
model reported by Mueller and McCloskey and suggested an
alternative 23-item, seven-factor model (MMSS-23).
However, Tourangeau and her colleagues found that three of
the eight MMSS-31 sub-dimensions reported by Mueller and
McCloskey had unacceptably low Cronbach's alpha coeffi-
cients (extrinsic rewards, Cronbach's  = .67; satisfaction
with coworkers, Pearson's r = .56; family/work balance,
Cronbach's  = .29). Mueller and McCloskey (1990) reported
low reliability coefficients for the same sub-scales.
The studies by Mueller and McCloskey (1990) and
Tourangeau et al. (2006) bring into question the internal con-
sistency of MMSS-31 sub-dimensions across nurse popula-
tions and the suitability of the scale for use in non-Western
countries. In the first study of its kind in the Middle East,
Abu Ajamieh, Misener, Haddock, and Gleaton (1996) inves-
tigated the cultural appropriateness of the MMSS-31 as part
of a study of job satisfaction among Palestinian nurses on the
West Bank. Abu Ajamieh et al. (1996) could not extract more
than four factors from their West Bank data (Table 1). Five
MMSS-31 items did not load on any of Abu Ajamieh et al.'s
four factors: Item 3 "Benefits package," Item 8 "Weekends
off per month," Item 5 "Flexibility in scheduling your hours,"
Item 6 "Opportunities to work (consecutive) straight days,"
and Item 13 "Satisfaction with your immediate supervisor
(head nurse or facility manager)." Abu Ajamieh et al. sug-
gested rewording or reconceptualizing these items to improve
the validity and reliability of the MMSS-31 for use outside
the United States. Furthermore, Abu Ajamieh and his col-
leagues suggested that the MMSS-31 should be tested with a

Note. Six items included in Mueller and McCloskey's (1990) 31-item scale were omitted from the El-Jardali, Murray et al. (2013) study because they are
not relevant to the scope of nursing practice of most nurses in Lebanon and Qatar. The excluded items are: interaction with faculty, control of practice,
research, publication, responsibility, and control of conditions. The italicized items are as worded for the El-Jardali, Murray et al. (2013) study. Numbers in

four-category rating scale that excludes the middle neutral
category used by Mueller and McCloskey (1990).
MMSS items have been used in three studies of nurses in
Jordan. Mrayyan (2005) used the MMSS-31 to investigate
the relationship between nurse satisfaction and patient satis-
faction, and in a separate analysis, the relationship between
nurses' job satisfaction and intention to leave (Mrayyan,
2006). Maryyan administered the MMSS-31 in English to a
sample of nurses on the West Bank and relied on the reliabil-
itycoefficientsoriginallyreportedbyMuellerandMcCloskey
(1990).
Abualrub, Omari, and Abu Al Rub (2009) administered
the MMSS-31 in Arabic to investigate the effect of social
support on stress and satisfaction among hospital nurses in
Jordan and reported the Cronbach  coefficient for the scale
as .83. However, Abualrub et al. acknowledged that the psy-
chometric characteristics of theArabic version of the MMSS-
31 were not examined prior to data collection. As a result,
Abualrub et al. accepted that the results of their study may
not relate directly to those of similar studies conducted in
other languages. In a related study of support, satisfaction
and retention of Jordanian nurses in private and public hospi-
tals (Abualrub et al., 2009) reported Cronbach's alpha coef-
ficients for the Arabic MMSS-31 as .88 for their private
hospital sample and .83 for nurses in public hospitals.
El-Jardali, Dimassi, Dumit, Jamal, and Mouro (2009)
used the MMSS-31 to investigate the intention to leave of
nurses in Lebanon. The MMSS-31 was administered in
Arabic, English, and French. The respondents used four
Likert-type scale categories to rate MMSS-31 items (the
neutral category in the five-category scale was excluded as
recommended by Abu Ajamieh et al., 1996). El-Jardali et al.
(2009) reported acceptable Cronbach's alpha levels for five
of Mueller and McCloskey's (1990) eight sub-dimensions
(range = .75 for interaction to .83 for satisfaction with sched-
uling). Low reliability coefficients were reported for extrin-
sic rewards (.66); coworkers (.64); and balance of family/
work, Pearson's r = .44). El-Jardali et al. (2009) did not
examine whether language of completion biased nurses'
responses to MMSS items.
Al-Enezi, Chowdhury, Shah, and Al-Otabi (2009) used
Mueller and McCloskey's original five Likert-type rating
scale categories and 21 MMSS items (MMSS-21) to investi-
gate job satisfaction among nurses with multicultural back-
grounds in Kuwait. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the
21-item scale was .90. English and Arabic versions of the
MMSS-21 were compiled into a single questionnaire for the
convenience of Arabic and non-Arabic speaking respon-
dents. EFA identified five factors with Cronbach's alpha
coefficients ranging from .50 for "extrinsic rewards" to .86
for "professional opportunities." Al-Enezi et al. (2009)
reported that expatriate nurses were dissatisfied with "extrin-
sic rewards" for two reasons: differences between antici-
pated and actual earnings in Kuwait; and dissatisfaction with
the considerably higher incomes and other benefits enjoyed
exclusively by Kuwaiti nurses. Al-Enezi et al. (2009) did not
examine the MMSS-21 for possible item bias.
El-Jardali, Alameddine, et al. (2013) used 25 MMSS
items (MMSS-25) to investigate the retention of nurses in
underserved areas in Lebanon. The six MMSS-31 items
excluded (Table 1, footnote) were omitted because they were
irrelevant to nurses working in underserved areas. Nurses
used four Likert-type rating scale categories to respond to the
MMSS-25. The MMSS-25 was administered in Arabic. The
study was part of a wider investigation of nurses' intentions
to stay in underserved areas of Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, and
Qatar (El-Jardali, Murray, et al., 2013). In Qatar, the MMSS-
25 was administered in English. The MMSS-25 data col-
lected in Lebanon and Qatar provided the data set for our
methodological study.
Our review of studies of nurse satisfaction conducted in
the Middle East demonstrates that researchers have used dif-
ferent sets of MMSS-31 items, different rating categories,
different languages, and different populations to investigate
nurses' job satisfaction in the region, and that the measure-
ment characteristics of the resulting scales have not been suf-
ficiently examined. Consequently, investigators intending to
conduct future studies of nurses' job satisfaction in Middle
Eastern countries need guidance on the following important
methodological questions:
1. How many rating scale categories should be used
when conducting studies with MMSS items in Middle
Eastern countries?
2. Which MMSS items are most productive of measure-
ment when used in the region?
3. Are MMSS items biased when administered to
Arabic speaking local nurses or in English to interna-
tionally educated nurses in the region?
4. Irrespective of language of administration (Arabic or
English) are responses to MMSS items biased by the
income level of the country of employment?
5. Within the limitations of the number of MMSS items
used in studies of nurse satisfaction in Middle Eastern
countries, which reported factor structure for the
MMSS is most plausible?
6. What do answers to the first five questions suggest
for investigators planning to use MMSS items for
future studies of nurse job satisfaction in Middle
Eastern countries?
The purpose of our article is to contribute to answering
these questions.
Method
Ours is a methodological study that used the Rasch rating
scale model (Andrich, 1978) and confirmatory factor analy-
sis (CFA) to examine the psychometric characteristics of the
MMSS-25 and item subsets in a secondary analysis of data
4 SAGE Open
collected from registered nurses in Lebanon and internation-
ally educated nurses in Qatar. Eligibility criteria for the par-
ent study (El-Jardali, Murray, et al., 2013) were as follows:
registered nurses of any nationality with at least 12 months in
their current employment who were able to complete the
study questionnaire in Arabic if working in Lebanon, in
English if working in Qatar. The Arabic version of the
MMSS-25 was prepared following consultation with a panel
of registered nurses in Lebanon and forward and back trans-
lation by independent translators.
Participants
The characteristics of the respondents to the MMSS-25 are
described in Table 2.
Instrumentation
We used the items listed in Table 1 and the data collected in
Lebanon and Qatar (El-Jardali, Murray, et al., 2013) to inves-
tigate the measurement performance of the MMSS-25. We
examined response category ordering (whether use of rating
scale categories increased monotonically as expected), item
difficulty (the ordering of items from the least difficult to the
most difficult to endorse), dimensionality or fit (whether the
items measured a single latent construct), targeting (whether
the difficulty of endorsing MMSS items was appropriate for
the sample), separation (whether the MMSS-25 was sensi-
tive enough to distinguish between nurses with high and low
levels of satisfaction), reliability (whether there is a high
probability that respondents with high satisfaction measures
were more satisfied than those with lower measures), and
differential item functioning (DIF; whether MMSS-25 items
were easier to endorse for nurses in Lebanon or in Qatar). We
concluded our analysis by using CFA to compare the fit of
five factor structures reported in the literature to our data.
The Rasch Measurement Model
The Rasch Measurement Model was developed by the
Danish mathematician Georg Rasch (1980) as a special case
of the general linear model (GLM). The Rasch model speci-
fies the probability of correct responses to test items and
strength of endorsement of rating scale items. The ability of
respondents (aptitude for selecting correct answers/tendency
to endorse rating scale items) and the difficulty of items
(probability of a correct answer or of endorsing a particular
category in a rating scale) are modeled on a continuous latent
variable measured in logits (additive log-odds units of equal
measurement). For Rasch analyses of responses to polyto-
mous items, the data are fit to the following mathematical
model: loge (Pnij/Pni(j-1)) = Bn - Di - Fj, where loge is the
natural logarithm of the probability Pnij of person n of ability
Bn endorsing category j in response to a scale item of diffi-
culty Di, as opposed to the probability Pni(j-1) of the person
endorsing the next lowest category (j - 1). For example, if j
is the endorsement of "4" on a 5-point Likert-type scale,
(j - 1) would be the endorsement of "3," the adjacent lower
category. In this formulation, the parameter Fj defines the
same rating scale structure for all items (Linacre, 2012).
Unlike raw scores for a test instrument or questionnaire
that have unknown intervals, the Rasch model enables inves-
tigators to calibrate item difficulty and measure personal
ability using standardized intervals of measurement along a
common continuum or latent trait.
More specifically, Rasch analysis examines how well items
in a test or rating scale contribute to the useful measurement of
an assumed one-dimensional latent variable (Rasch, 1980).
Rasch fit statistics indicate how well respondents and their
responses fit the response pattern predicted by the Rasch mea-
surement model. Infit and outfit statistics are calculated as chi-
square values that range from zero to infinity. Infit and outfit
values for an item that perfectly matches the Rasch model have
a mean square value (MNSQ) of 1. Items with MNSQ values
greater than 1 overfit the model because they lack precision.
Items with values less than 1 are too predictable and may not
achieve successful measurement. (Linacre, 2012). In Rasch
analysis, the dimensionality of rating scales and subscales can

sions that need investigation (Linacre, 2012).

Results
Response Ordering
We examined response ordering for the six-category rating
scale used in the El-Jardali, Murray, et al. (2013) study (0 =
no response, 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = agree,
4 = strongly agree, 5 = not important to me). With responses
in the "not important to me category" rescored as 0s, response
categories for 23 of the 25 MMSS items were disordered.
The exceptions were Item 15 "The physicians you work
with" and Item 21 "Opportunities for career advancement."
Categories 0 and 1 were disordered for 21 of the 23 disor-
dered items. Categories 1 and 2 were disordered for Item 1
"Salary" and Item 11 "Maternity leave time." Response cat-
egory disordering was corrected by excluding null and not
important to me responses. All of the following results were
obtained using the four-category rating scale: 1 = strongly
disagree, 2 = disagree, 3= agree, and 4 = strongly agree.
Item Difficulty
The measurement characteristics of the MMSS-25 were
explored using the corrected four-category rating scale
described in the previous paragraph. Respondents' mean raw
satisfaction scores were in the range 2.01
(n = 830) for Item 12 "Child care facilities" to 3.05 (n =
1,162) for Item 14 "Your nursing peers." When measured
with the Rasch dimensioned latent satisfaction variable, the
mean measures ranged from -1.63 logits for Item 14 to 1.23
logits for Item 12, with higher logit values indicating more
difficulty in endorsing the satisfied and very satisfied rating
categories. Respondents expressed their relative dissatisfac-
tion with Item 3 "Benefit package" (M = 1.19 logits), Item 1
"Salary" (1.08 logits), and Item 10 "Compensation (pay) for
weekend work" (M = 1.01 logits). The nurses endorsed
higher categories of satisfaction for the items measuring per-
ceptions of their relationships with colleagues: Item 14 "Your
nursing peers" (M = -1.63 logits; Item 13 "Satisfaction with
your immediate supervisor (head nurse or facility manager)"
(M = -1.15 logits); and Item 15 "The physicians you work
with" (M = -1.05 logits). With respect to the Mueller and
McCloskey (1990) categorization of items, respondents
expressed least satisfaction "safety needs" items, somewhat
more satisfaction with "psychological needs" items, and
most satisfaction with "social needs" items (Figure 1).
Figure 1 shows the relationship between measured nurse
satisfaction and difficulty of endorsing MMSS items. The
numbers in the first column (bottom to top) from -1 to 3 are
measures of nurse satisfaction in logits. The distribution of
satisfaction measures for this sample is flatter than a normal
distribution and positively skewed. The difficulty of endors-
ing satisfaction with a MMSS item is shown in the column on
the right. Only nurses with satisfaction scores 1.3 standard
deviations above the sample mean were satisfied with Item 12
"Child care facilities" and Item 3 "Benefits package."
Nurses with satisfaction scores 1 standard deviation above
the mean measure for the sample expressed satisfaction with
Item 10 "Compensation (pay) for weekend work" and Item
11 "Salary." The easiest item for the nurses to express satis-
faction with was Item 14 "Your nursing peers." Nurses with
levels of satisfaction at or above -1.43 standard deviations
from the sample mean were able to express satisfaction with
this item. The hierarchy of item difficulty can be seen by
reading down the column on the right from the most difficult
items (Items 12 and 13) to the easiest item (Item 14). More
satisfaction with coworkers and interaction opportunities
was expressed than with scheduling or with professional
opportunities. Least satisfaction was expressed with the
extrinsic needs of child care and benefits.
Dimensionality
We examined the dimensionality of the MMSS-25.The
measures explained a relatively poor 39.5% of the raw vari-
ance (Fisher, 2009). MMSS-25 items explained 12.2% of the
raw variance, 1.62 times more than explained by the first
contrast. The eigenvalue of 3.1 for the first contrast sug-
gested the presence of a non-Rasch dimension with the
strength of approximately three items. Items 22, 21, 24, 25,
and 23 loaded .4 (.48-.40) at one pole of the secondary
dimension, in contrast to Items 8, 4, 6, 2, and 9 that loaded
-.47 to -.41 at the opposite pole.
The first contrast may differentiate responses by types of
need, with Items 22, 21, 24, 25, and 23 eliciting responses that
reflect psychological needs and Items 8, 4, 6, 2, and 9 reflect-
ing safety needs. We noted that Item 11 "Maternity leave
time," Item 12 "Child care for employees'children at facility,"
and Item 13 "Your head nurse or facility manager" had infit
and outfit MNSQ values that exceeded 1.3; our cutoff value
for under fitting items. None of the items had MNSQ values
less than 0.6, our cutoff value for overly predictable items.
Our analysis indicated the possible existence of a second
non-Rasch dimension with a strength of approximately two
items (eigenvalue = 2.0) that explained 5.0% of the unexplained
variance. Items 24, 22, and 25 loaded .4 (.58-.41) at one pole
of this dimension, in contrast to Items 18, 19, and 17 that loaded
-.54 to -.45 at the opposite pole. This dimension may distin-
guish items that measure satisfaction with self-esteem needs
from those that measure satisfaction with affiliation needs.
6 SAGE Open
Items that loaded positively and negatively on the contrasts
derived from the principal components analysis (PCA) of
residuals were used to estimate differential person functioning
using independent t tests. Since >5% of the t-test values (9.6%)
for the first contrast and 10.7% for the second contrast were
outside the range ±1.96 multidimensionality was confirmed.
Removing the three items with infit and outfit MNSQ val-
ues greater than 1.3, Items 11 (1.37, 1.38), 12 (1.45, 1.33),
and 13 (1.33, 1.39) increased the proportion of raw score
variance explained by the Rasch dimension to 39.8%. For all
practical purposes, the strengths of the first and second con-
trasts remained unchanged (eigenvalues = 3.0, 2.0).
Therefore, we retained Items 11 to 13.
Targeting
The MMSS-25 items were a very good fit for 85% of the
sample; person mean discrimination -0.14 logits, model root
mean square error (RMSE) 0.36 logits, item mean discrimi-
nation 0.00, model RMSE 0.05 logits (Figure 1). The nurses
ranged in satisfaction from -6.56 to 7.47 logits. The mean
difficulty of the items was slightly greater than the mean sat-
isfaction of the nurses -.14 logits. No items matched the
8.6% of the nurses with the highest levels of satisfaction or
the 6.4% of least satisfied nurses.
Person Separation and Reliability
The WINSTEPS person separation index indicates the sensitiv-
ity of a measure to distinguish between higher and lower mea-
sures among a study sample (Linacre, 2012). The MSS-25 was
sensitive enough to distinguish approximately four strata of
nurse satisfaction, person reliability index 0.87. The person raw
score test reliability (estimated traditional test­retest reliability
Cronbach's ) for the MMSS-25 was approximately .95.

of the same strength. We examined whether nurses in Qatar
(n = 427) and nurses in Lebanon (n = 786) with the same
Rasch measures for job satisfaction responded differently to
MMSS-25 items. None of the items was biased in favor of
nurses in either country, confirming that the MMSS items
were not biased irrespective of whether nurses responded in
Arabic or English, nor were items biased by nurses' country
of employment: middle income (Lebanon) or high income
(Qatar).
Discussion
Rating Scale Categories
Although the MMSS is a well-established and occupation
specific measure of nurses' job satisfaction, its psychometric
properties when used with samples outside Western coun-
tries have not been critically examined. Until now, no attempt
has been made to determine whether MMSS items adminis-
tered in English or Arabic in countries in the Middle East are
biased in favor of local or internationally educated nurses.
Furthermore, in the absence of studies conducted in middle-
income and high-income countries in the region, there has
been a gap in knowledge about whether the MMSS is uni-
formly productive of measurement when used outside North
America. Our results do not support Abu Ajamieh et al.'s
(1996) recommendation that a four-category rating scale
should be used when investigating nurses' job satisfaction in
the region. Reducing the rating categories to four for our
Rasch analyses contributed to the relatively small proportion
of variance explained by MMSS-25 items.
We recommend that investigators conducting future stud-
ies of nurses' job satisfaction in Middle Eastern countries
rely on the four-category scale (strongly disagree, disagree,
agree, and strongly agree) only when they have added items
that are easier and more difficult to endorse than those in the
MMSS-25, or remove items clustered around the center of
the distribution for item difficulty. These strategies are
required to increase the proportion of variance explained by
MMSS items, irrespective of whether the scale is adminis-
tered in English or Arabic.
DIF
Our results show that responses to MMSS items concerned
with salary and benefits are not biased in favor of nurses in
either high- or middle-income countries in the Middle East.
This finding is counterintuitive because nurses' salaries in
Qatar are significantly higher than the salaries paid to nurses
in Lebanon. The benefits available to nurses in Qatar are
similarly more generous than those available to nurses in
Lebanon. The reason we did not find the MMSS salary and
benefit items biased in favor of either Lebanese nurses or
internationally educated nurses in Qatar is because we
excluded nurses with extreme high and low satisfaction
scores from our DIF analyses. When we repeated our DIF
analyses with the deleted records reinstated, we found
medium to strong evidence of item bias. We found that Item
4 "Hours that you work" was significantly more difficult for
nurses in Lebanon to express satisfaction with compared
with those in Qatar (effect size = 1.25 logits, t = 12.6, df =
966, p < .01). A moderate to large DIF value was found for
Item 6 "Opportunities to work (consecutive) straight days"
(effect size = 0.72 logits, t = 7.23, df = 966, p < .001), which
was also more difficult for nurses in Lebanon to endorse.
Conversely, Item 7 "Opportunity for part-time work" (effect
size = -0.78 logits, t = 7.64, df = 740, p < .001); Item 13
"Satisfaction with your immediate supervisor (head nurse or
facility manager)" (effect size = -0.98 logits, t = 9.19, df inf.,
p < .001); Item 14 "Your nursing peers" (effect size = -0.70
logits, t = -6.9, df inf., p < .001); Item 15 "The physicians
you work with" (effect size = -0.79 logits, t = -7.44, df inf.,
p < .001); and item 15 "The physicians you work with"
(effect size = -0.63 logits, t = -6.71, df inf., p = .004) were
more difficult for nurses in Qatar to endorse. We suggest that
investigators measuring nurse job satisfaction in Middle
Eastern countries consider the possibility of bias in MMSS
items and consider either dropping seemingly biased items
from their data set or including additional satisfaction items
to offset the possibility of DIF.
Dimensionality
The literature we reviewed indicates that an eight-factor
model for the MMSS and a three sub-dimension model
(Mueller & McCloskey, 1990), a seven-factor model
(Tourangeau et al., 2006), a five-factor model (Al-Enezi
et al., 2009), and a four-factor model (Abu Ajamieh et al.,
1996) are plausible (Table 3).
We ran a CFA using PCA with varimax rotation to exam-
ine the fit of seven of (Mueller & McCloskey, 1990) eight-
factor models to our data. The analysis was restricted to data
on the 25 items common to the El-Jardali, Murray, et al.
(2013) study and the MMSS-31. We ran a second CFA analy-
sis to examine the fit of the three sub-dimensions under
which Mueller and McCloskey (1990) subsumed their eight-
factor model. We examined the fit of five of Tourangeau
et al.'s (2006) seven-factor model. This analysis was
restricted to the 13 MMSS items common to the El-Jardali,
Murray, et al. (2013) study and the Tourangeau et al. study.
We ran additional CFA analyses to examine the fit of the
five-factor model proposed by Al-Enezi et al. (2009) and the
four-factor model reported by Abu Ajamieh et al. (1996).
The results of our analyses are shown in Table 4. The
chi-square values can be ignored due to the large size of
our sample. Comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square
error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root
mean square residual (SRMSR) values indicate that a five-
factor model derived from the Tourangeau et al.'s (2006)
seven-factor model provided a close fit for 13 MMSS

items (MMSS-13). However, we could not investigate fac-
tor structure invariance across samples because we did not
have data on all 31 items included in Mueller and
McCloskey's (1990) eight-factor model. Neither could we
examine the fit of the full Tourangeau et al. (2006) seven-
factor model.
Clinton et al. 9
In light of these findings, we reexamined the item-person
map for the MMSS-25. Figure 1 shows that as many as 14
MMSS-25 items could be redundant. When we examined
item redundancy among MMSS-13 items, we identified five
potentially redundant items. The items for possible deletion
were Item 3 "Benefits package," Item 5 "Flexibility in sched-
uling your hours," Item 6 "Opportunities to work (consecu-
tive) straight days," Item 8 "Weekends off per month," Item
9 "Flexibility in scheduling time-off," and Item 19
"Professional interactions with other disciplines." We
retained all five items because they did not duplicate the
meaning of the items with which they shared similar Rasch
item measures. We suggest that investigators conducting
studies of nurse job satisfaction in Middle Eastern countries
consider using the MMSS-13 as a core set of items with
which to screen nurses for work satisfaction.
The MMSS-13 has acceptable psychometric characteris-
tics: model fit mean-square values range from 0.80 to 1.26,
with the exception of Item 13 "Satisfaction with your imme-
diate supervisor (head nurse or facility manager)," outfit
MNSQ 1.38, infit MNSQ 1.43; mean non-extreme person
measure -.27, model error 0.49; person reliability index .80,
estimated Cronbach's alpha .91; person index 2.03, sufficient
to distinguish among three strata of satisfaction (low satis-
faction, moderate satisfaction, higher satisfaction). However,
the ceiling effect of the MMSS-13 excluded 8.4% of the
most satisfied nurses in our sample. The floor effect of the
scale excluded a further 16% of our sample. Consequently,
our study supports (Mueller & McCloskey, 1990) suggestion
that investigators should add items independent of the
MMSS-31 according to their specific research objectives.
When we excluded the 12 non-MMSS-13 items, the pro-
portion of raw variance explained by the measures increased
from 39.5% to 42.5%, which falls short of the 50% required
(Fisher, 2007) to achieve more than a poor quality of mea-
surement. However, 42.5% of explained raw variance in
Rasch analysis is sufficient for such practical purpose as ini-
tial screening of respondents if the first contrast to the Rasch
dimension does not indicate an obvious non-Rasch dimen-
sion. The MMSS-13 items explained 12.6% of the raw vari-
ance in our data. The proportion of variance explained by the
measures can be improved by including participants with a
wider range of satisfaction measures, by sampling nurses in
a wider range of health care facilities, by conducting multi-
site studies or by including nurses with more diverse qualifi-
cations. In addition to including more items targeted at nurses
with lower and higher levels of satisfaction, the proportion of
raw variance explained can be increased by including items
known to be relevant to nurses in the sample rather than rely-
ing on items selected from the (Mueller & McCloskey, 1990)
31-item set.
The empirical usefulness of our shorter scale in Middle
Eastern countries needs to be established. Whether investiga-
tors should use the MMSS-31 or our shorter version depends
on the purpose of their studies. For initial assessment of
nurse job satisfaction and for collecting time series data, the
shorter scale may be preferred. However for more complex
studies, including those that involve causal analyses in which
hypotheses are tested about factors that influence nurses' job
satisfaction, the most productive approach would be to com-
bine the MMSS-13 scale with hypothesis-specific items.
More work needs to be done on the dimensionality of the
MMSS as a whole and on shorter versions because Maslow's
(1954) hierarchy of human needs does not provide a suffi-
ciently predictive theory for understanding occupation spe-
cific job satisfaction. Whereas the hierarchy of needs offers
a general framework for understanding human motivation,
the assumptions on which it is based, such as the discrete-
ness of levels of human needs, are untenable because it is
incapable of capturing situation-specific causal factors.
When considering the use of job satisfaction items in sam-
ples of local nurses working in Middle Eastern countries,
investigators should consider the possibility of item bias
among MMSS items. We found that Item 13 "Satisfaction
with your immediate supervisor (head nurse or facility man-
ager)" could be biased in favor of nurses working in cultur-
ally homogeneous work settings, such as Lebanese nurses
working in Lebanon (effect size = -1.16 logits, t = 10.6, df =
991, p < .001).
We readily acknowledge the limitations of our study. Our
Rasch and CFA analyses were conducted as a secondary
analysis of data on only 25 of Mueller and McCloskey's
(1990) 31 MMSS items. Furthermore, the response catego-
ries we used were different from those used by Mueller &
McCloskey (1990). Despite these limitations, we have estab-
lished that the MMSS-31 is not a suitable measure for inves-
tigating nurses' job satisfaction in Middle Eastern countries.
The scale explains a relatively low proportion of raw score
variance in nurses' job satisfaction scores, and up to 45% of
MMSS items may be redundant depending on the setting and
context. Whereas the MMSS is clearly not unidimensional,
further studies are required to establish its factor structure.
Four of five factor models tested were plausible but not a
close fit to our data. We have reported on a close fitting fac-
tor structure for MMSS-13 scale items, which are suitable
for administering inArabic or English to nurses in the region.
At the same time, we have confirmed that the MMSS-13 pro-
vides a psychometrically acceptable core set of items to ini-
tially screen nurses in the Middle Eastern countries for levels
of job satisfaction, irrespective of whether they work in mid-
dle- or high-income countries in the region.
