The rate of erroneous conviction of innocent criminal defendants
is often described as not merely unknown but unknowable. There
is no systematic method to determine the accuracy of a criminal
conviction; if there were, these errors would not occur in the first
place. As a result, very few false convictions are ever discovered,
and those that are discovered are not representative of the group
as a whole. In the United States, however, a high proportion of
false convictions that do come to light and produce exonerations
are concentrated among the tiny minority of cases in which
defendants are sentenced to death. This makes it possible to use
data on death row exonerations to estimate the overall rate of
false conviction among death sentences. The high rate of exoner-
ation among death-sentenced defendants appears to be driven by
the threat of execution, but most death-sentenced defendants are
removed from death row and resentenced to life imprisonment,
after which the likelihood of exoneration drops sharply. We use
survival analysis to model this effect, and estimate that if all
death-sentenced defendants remained under sentence of death
indefinitely, at least 4.1% would be exonerated. We conclude that
this is a conservative estimate of the proportion of false conviction
among death sentences in the United States.
capital punishment | criminal justice | wrongful conviction
In the past few decades a surge of hundreds of exonerations
of innocent criminal defendants has drawn attention to the
problem of erroneous conviction, and led to a spate of reforms in
criminal investigation and adjudication (1­3). All the same, the
most basic empirical question about false convictions remains
unanswered: How common are these miscarriages of justice?
False convictions, by definition, are unobserved when they
occur: If we know that a defendant is innocent, he is not con-
victed in the first place. They are also extremely difficult to de-
tect after the fact. As a result, the great majority of innocent
defendants remain undetected. The rate of such errors is often
described as a "dark figure" (4)--an important measure of the
performance of the criminal justice system that is not merely
unknown but unknowable.
However, there is no shortage of lawyers and judges who as-
sert confidently that the number of false convictions is negligible.
Judge Learned Hand said so in 1923: "Our [criminal] procedure
has always been haunted by the ghost of the innocent man
convicted. It is an unreal dream" (5, p. 649). And in 2007, Justice
Antonin Scalia wrote in a concurring opinion in the Supreme
Court that American criminal convictions have an "error rate of
[0].027 percent--or, to put it another way, a success rate of
99.973 percent" (6, p. 182). This would be comforting, if true. In
fact, the claim is silly. Scalia's ratio is derived by taking the
number of known exonerations at the time, which were limited
almost entirely to a small subset of murder and rape cases, using
it as a measure of all false convictions (known and unknown),
and dividing it by the number of all felony convictions for all
crimes, from drug possession and burglary to car theft and in-
come tax evasion.
To actually estimate the proportion of erroneous convictions
we need a well-defined group of criminal convictions within
which we identify all mistaken convictions, or at least most. It is
hard to imagine how that could be done for criminal convictions
generally, but it might be possible for capital murder.
The rate of exonerations among death sentences in the United
States is far higher than for any other category of criminal con-
victions. Death sentences represent less than one-tenth of 1% of
prison sentences in the United States (7), but they accounted for
about 12% of known exonerations of innocent defendants from
1989 through early 2012 (2), a disproportion of more than 130 to 1.
A major reason for this extraordinary exoneration rate is that far
more attention and resources are devoted to death penalty cases
than to other criminal prosecutions, before and after conviction.
The vast majority of criminal convictions are not candidates
for exoneration because no one makes any effort to reconsider
the guilt of the defendants. Approximately 95% of felony con-
victions in the United States are based on negotiated pleas of
guilty (plea bargains) that are entered in routine proceedings at
which no evidence is presented. Few are ever subject to any re-
view whatsoever. Most convicted defendants are never repre-
sented by an attorney after conviction, and the appeals that
do take place are usually perfunctory and unrelated to guilt
or innocence.
Death sentences are different. Almost all are based on con-
victions after jury trial, and even the handful of capital defend-
ants who plead guilty are then subject to trial-like-sentencing
hearings, usually before juries. All death sentences are reviewed
on appeal; almost all are reviewed repeatedly. With few excep-
tions, capital defendants have lawyers as long as they remain on
death row. Everyone, from the first officer on the scene of
a potentially capital crime to the Chief Justice of the United
States, takes capital cases more seriously than other criminal
prosecutions--and knows that everybody else will do so as well.
And everyone from defense lawyers to innocence projects to
governors and state and federal judges is likely to be particularly
careful to avoid the execution of innocent defendants.
This extraordinary difference in resources and attention gen-
erates two related effects. (i) Advocates for a defendant are
much more likely to pursue any plausible postconviction claim of
innocence if the defendant is under sentence of death. (ii) Courts
Significance
The rate of erroneous conviction of innocent criminal defend-
ants is often described as not merely unknown but unknow-
able. We use survival analysis to model this effect, and estimate
that if all death-sentenced defendants remained under sentence
of death indefinitely at least 4.1% would be exonerated. We
conclude that this is a conservative estimate of the proportion of
false conviction among death sentences in the United States.

(and other government actors) are much more likely to consider
and grant such a claim if the defendant is at risk for execution.
As a result, false convictions are far more likely to be detected
among those cases that end in death sentences than in any other
category of criminal convictions.
The high exoneration rate for death sentences suggests that
a substantial proportion of innocent defendants who are sen-
tenced to death are ultimately exonerated, perhaps a majority. If
so, we can use capital exonerations as a basis for estimating a
lower bound for the false conviction rate among death sentences.
Since 1973, when the first death penalty laws now in effect
in the United States were enacted (8), 143 death-sentenced
defendants have been exonerated, from 1 to 33 y after conviction
(mean = 10.1 y) (9). In a previous study we found that 2.3% of all
death sentences imposed from 1973 through 1989 resulted in
exoneration by the end of 2004 (7). A study by Risinger (10)
estimated that had biological samples been available for testing
in all cases, 3.3% of defendants sentenced to death between 1982
and 1989 for murders that included rape would have been ex-
onerated by DNA evidence through February 2006. That esti-
mate, however, is based on a small number of exonerations (n =
11) (10). Both studies were limited to convictions that occurred
15 y or more before the study date, and so include a high pro-
portion of all exonerations that will ever occur in the relevant
groups. Nonetheless both studies underestimate the false con-
viction rate for death-sentenced defendants because they do not
reflect exonerations that occur after the study period, and do not
include false convictions that are never detected at all.
Capital defendants who are removed from death row but not
exonerated--typically because their sentences are reduced to life
imprisonment--no longer receive the extraordinary level of at-
tention that is devoted to death row inmates. (This applies as
well to those who are executed or die on death row from other
causes.) If they are in fact innocent, they are much less likely to
be exonerated than if they had remained on death row. As a re-
sult, the proportion of death-sentenced inmates who are exon-
erated understates the rate of false convictions among death
sentences because the intensive search for possible errors is
largely abandoned once the threat of execution is removed.
In other words, the engine that produces an exoneration rate
that is a plausible proxy for the rate of false conviction among
death-sentenced prisoners is the process of reinvestigation and
reconsideration under threat of execution. Over time, most
death-sentenced inmates are removed from death row and
resentenced to life in prison--at which point their chances of
exoneration appear to drop back to the background rate for all
murders, or close to it. Thus, we will get a better estimate of the
rate of false capital convictions if are able to estimate "what the
rate of capital exonerations would be if all death sentences were
subject for an indefinite period to the level of scrutiny that
applies to those facing the prospect of execution" (7). This study
does just that.
Current Study
Data. We examine exonerations among defendants sentenced to
death from the beginning of the "modern" death penalty in the
United States in 1973, after the Supreme Court invalidated all
prior death sentencing laws (11), through the end of 2004. Our
data come from two sources. (i) Death sentences since 1973 are
tracked by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) of the De-
partment of Justice, which maintains data on the current status
of all death-sentenced defendants in that period (12). We know
that 7,482 defendants were sentenced to death in the United
States from January 1973 through December 2004, and we know
when (if ever) each defendant was removed from death row by
execution, death by other means, or legal action by courts or
executive officials. (ii) The Death Penalty Information Center
maintains a list of defendants who were sentenced to death in the
United States and exonerated since the beginning of 1973 (13),
including 117 who were sentenced to death after January 1, 1973
and exonerated by legal proceedings that began before the end
of 2004. We collected additional data on these cases from public
records and media sources, expanding on the dataset used by
Gross and O'Brien (7). We were able to match on several key
variables 108 of the 117 death sentence exonerations in this
period to specific cases in the BJS database to produce the da-
tabase we analyzed.
Table 1 displays the status of the 7,482 death-sentenced
defendants we studied as of December 31, 2004, the final day of
our study period. On that date, 12.6% of these defendants had
been executed, 1.6% were exonerated, 4% died of suicide or
natural causes while on death row, 46.1% remained on death
row, and 35.8% were removed from death row but remained in
prison after their capital sentences or the underlying convictions
were reversed or modified.
Table 1 is a snapshot of the status of these defendants at the
end of the study period. (It would look quite different if it dis-
played the status of death-sentenced defendants at the end of
1985, for example, or 2000.) It cannot be used directly to esti-
mate the rate of exoneration because exonerations are a function
of time. Many of the defendants on death row at the end of 2004
had only been there for a year or two, far less than the mean of
10.1 y from conviction to exoneration for all capital exonerations
since 1973.
Over time, many of those who remained on death row at the
end of 2004 will be removed (or already have been); most will
end up with sentences of life imprisonment. If the pattern for
death sentences from 1973 through 1995 holds, over two-thirds
of prisoners sentenced to death will have the judgments against
them overturned. The majority will remain in prison for life (14,
15), but some will be exonerated and released.
Threat of Execution. A central variable of interest is whether an
exoneration took place while the defendant was still under
threat of execution (for detailed information, see SI Materials and

Methods, section 1). The status of the defendant as under threat
is obvious when a defendant is exonerated and released directly
from death row. On the other side, a defendant is clearly not
under threat of execution when the exoneration is the product of
a process that began years after removal from death row.
In other cases, determining the threat status of the defendant
at the time of exoneration is more demanding. We identify
defendants who were under threat of execution to focus on
exonerations that benefited from the extraordinary levels of ef-
fort and scrutiny that are applied to defendants who might be put
to death. Many defendants who leave death row might be sent
back. Hence the under-threat-of-execution category includes
defendants who were removed from death row but remained
eligible for resentencing to death, and in whose cases the pros-
ecution was actively pursuing a new death sentence or consid-
ering whether to do so. For example, Ronald Williamson was
sentenced to death in Oklahoma in 1988, and awarded a new
trial in 1997 because of constitutionally inadequate representa-
tion by his trial lawyer (16). He was exonerated by DNA testing
2 y later, in 1999, while awaiting a retrial at which he might have
been sentenced to death again. His exoneration was under threat
of execution.
We also count an exoneration as under threat if the process
that ultimately led to the exoneration began while the defendant
was on death row, even if the final decision to release the de-
fendant was made after he left death row. This sort of delay is
common for defendants who are removed from death row when
their convictions are reversed by reviewing courts but not re-
leased until months or years later when the prosecution decides
to dismiss the charges. In some cases the process is more elab-
orate. For instance, John Thompson was sentenced to death in
Louisiana in 1985 (13). In 2001 he sought a new trial based on
newly discovered evidence, but received only a reduction in his
sentence to life imprisonment. Thompson successfully appealed
the denial of a new trial and was acquitted in 2003. Thus, al-
though his death sentence was vacated 2 y before his acquittal,
we treat him as exonerated under threat of execution because the
legal proceedings that led to exoneration began while he was on
death row and ran to their conclusion two years later.
We define an exoneration under threat of execution as an
exoneration that is the result of legal proceedings that were
initiated while the defendant was on death row. The date we
assign to an exoneration is the date of removal from death row,
the last date on which the exoneration can be initiated and still
count as under threat, not the date on which the process was
completed. Using these criteria, we determined that 107 of the
117 exonerations that occurred before the end of 2004 were
under threat of execution, and 10 exonerations were not under
that threat. The significance of this classification is apparent
from Table 1. Of defendants sentenced to death since 1973,
35.8% had been resentenced to a prison term by the end of 2004.
However, only 8.5% of capital exonerations (10 of 117) came
from this group even though these prisoners were, by definition,
at a later stage of their imprisonment than those who remained
on death row. (Except for those who are exonerated--and a very
small group who are resentenced to lesser penalties and even-
tually released--all prisoners who are sentenced to death do
ultimately die in prison. They all start out on death row, some
stay there until death by execution by other means, and the rest
eventually are moved to the general prison population where
they remain until they die.)
Our estimate of the rate of false convictions among death-
sentenced defendants is based on the hypothesis that death-
sentenced prisoners who remain under threat of execution are
far more likely to be exonerated than those who remain in prison
but no longer face that threat. We use a Cox proportional haz-
ards model with a time-dependent covariate to test that hypoth-
esis. We find, consistent with expectations, that death-sentenced
defendants who are no longer under threat of execution had
a rate of exoneration approximately one eighth of that for
defendants who remained on death row, 0.131 (P < 0.0001)
(with 95% confidence interval of 0.064­0.266) (SI Materials
and Methods, section 3).
Analysis. Our task is to estimate the cumulative probability over
time of the event of interest, exoneration, in the population of
death-sentenced defendants who remain under threat of execu-
tion. The temporal measure (t) is time from conviction. Esti-
mating this probability is complicated by the structure of the

population for two reasons. (i) Individual defendants joined this
population across a 32-y period. Their duration in the study
period varied from 1 to 32 y. (ii) All death-sentenced defendants
began, at conviction, under threat of execution, but for most that
threat, and their membership in the population of interest,
ended within several years, usually because they were resen-
tenced to life imprisonment. The net effect is that the number of
defendants under threat of execution is a decreasing function of
time from conviction, ranging from n = 7,482 at t = 0 y to n = 0 at
t = 30.7 y (Fig. 1).
To estimate this cumulative probability, we use survival anal-
ysis. This technique has been used in a related context, to esti-
mate the rate of all reversals of death sentences in the United
States (15). It is most commonly used, however, to evaluate the
efficacy of medical treatments when not all patients experience
the outcome of interest. The issue we address is analogous, but
the analogy is counterintuitive.
We use survival analysis to assess the prospects of members of
a population that is subject to a special risk. In the usual medical
context, the condition that defines the population is a pathology
such as Lyme disease or diabetes; for our study the defining
condition is "death sentence." As a result of this condition, every
member of this population is subject to the risk of a terminal
event that might remove him from the group that has survived
with this condition. In biomedical survival studies, that terminal
event that is studied is death from the pathology in question; for
our study it is exoneration. This is a counterintuitive equivalence:
For our purposes, remaining in prison following a death sentence
counts as "survival;" and exoneration, which removes the subject
from prison, is analogous to "death" in the common context in
which survival analysis is used.
Survival analysis is often used to evaluate the efficacy of
a medical treatment that may reduce mortality from a pathology.
In this study the "treatment" that lowers the probability of the
terminal event of interest (exoneration) is removal of the threat
of execution. (This too is a counterintuitive analogy. Exonerating
an innocent defendant is, of course, a good thing for that de-
fendant, but removal from death row is equivalent to a treatment
that reduces the "risk" of exoneration.) Our focus, however, is
not on the treated group (those removed from death row) but on
those who remain untreated (defendants who remain under
threat of execution and therefore at high risk of exoneration).
In this study, as in medical research, subjects may be removed
from the population of interest by means other than the terminal
event at issue. In survival analysis of a disease, the usual means of
exit by other means are death from a different cause or discon-
tinuation of participation in the study. In our study, all deaths
after capital sentencing (by execution, suicide, or natural causes)
remove the person from the population that is subject to the risk
of execution. However, most removals from the population by
means other than exoneration are by legal action that reduces
the defendant's sentence to life in prison and thereby eliminates
the threat of execution.
A primary difficulty in estimating the cumulative probability of
exoneration is that some defendants were censored, i.e., they did
not have an opportunity to be exonerated under threat of exe-
cution during the study period. Some defendants were removed
from that threat during the study period but would have been
exonerated had they remained under threat; others, who were
sentenced to death relatively recently, remained under threat
and had not been exonerated at the end of the study period but
would have been exonerated at some later point if the study
period were extended. As a result, a simple proportion of ex-
onerated defendants to all defendants is a biased estimate of the
cumulative probability of exoneration.
We therefore use the Kaplan­Meier estimator to calculate the
cumulative probability of exoneration under threat of execution
for death-sentenced defendants, by time from conviction through
2004. This estimator takes account of the censoring of observa-
tions caused by recency of incarceration on death row, death
from suicide or natural causes, or other removals from the threat
of execution. The Kaplan­Meier survival function estimates the
probability of being event-free (remaining on death row) up to
a given length of time from conviction. Its complement (1 minus
the estimator) estimates the cumulative incidence of the event
(exoneration) up to the given length of time from conviction.
Unlike a simple proportion, the Kaplan­Meier estimator is un-
biased in the presence of independent censoring (see further
discussions in Sensitivity Analysis), and is completely nonparametric;
it can be viewed as a censored data analog of the empirical dis-
tribution function. (17, 18) (SI Materials and Methods, section 2).
As Fig. 2 shows, the cumulative probability of exoneration for
death-sentenced defendants who remained under threat of exe-
cution for 21.4 y was 4.1% (with a 95% confidence interval of
2.8­5.2%). [We replicated the Kaplan­Meier estimate of the
cumulative probability of exoneration under threat of execution
using the Fleming­Harrington estimator. Both results are virtu-
ally indistinguishable (SI Materials and Methods, section 3).]
This 4.1% estimate may approach the underlying rate of false
convictions because it reflects the cumulative effect of a process
that is uniquely efficient at detecting such errors. To rely on this
estimate, however, two additional steps are necessary.
Sensitivity analysis. An important assumption for the validity of the
Kaplan­Meier estimator is that censoring events that remove
subjects from consideration are statistically independent of the
time to the event of interest if the subjects had not been re-
moved. In this context, that assumption is plausible with respect
to censoring by recency of conviction and by death from suicide
or natural causes while under threat of execution. On the other
hand, there are strong reasons to believe that both execution and
removal from death row by legal procedures without exoneration
are not independent of time-to-exoneration. Because the as-
sumption of independence may be violated, sensitivity analysis is
necessary.
Specifically, (i) 13% of death-sentenced inmates were re-
moved from death row by execution (943 of 7,482). Some exe-
cuted defendants may have been innocent, and, although none
has been exonerated after execution (9), they might have been
exonerated if they had remained alive and on death row. How-
ever, we expect that the proportion of innocent defendants is

lower among those who are executed than among those who
remain on death row (7) (SI Materials and Methods, section 4).
The threat of execution is the engine that drives the process of
exonerating innocent death row prisoners, and it is likely that this
process becomes more painstaking as inmates approach their
execution dates. This concern about executing innocent defend-
ants also drives a second bias: (ii) It increases the proportion of
innocent defendants among the 36% of death row inmates who
were removed from death row and resentenced to prison but not
exonerated (2,675 or 7,482). Courts and executive officials ex-
plicitly recognize that it is appropriate to take the possibility of
innocence into account in deciding whether to reverse a convic-
tion for procedural error or commute a death sentence to life
imprisonment, and a wealth of anecdotal evidence suggests that
this practice is widespread (SI Materials and Methods, section 4).
As a result, those who are resentenced to punishments less than
death are more likely to be innocent than those who remain on
death row.
In short, we believe that (i) executed defendants are less likely
to have been exonerated if they had remained on death row than
those who in fact remained on death row, and (ii) defendants
who were removed from death row but remained in prison are
more likely to have been exonerated if they had remained under
threat of execution.
These two biases are not equivalent in magnitude. Nearly
three times as many unexonerated death-sentenced defendants
were resentenced to prison (2,675) as were executed (943). Even
a modest increase in the proportion of innocent defendants
among death-sentenced prisoners resentenced to life imprison-
ment, compared with those who remain on death row, would
more than offset a complete absence of innocent defendants
among those who are executed.
We use competing risks methodology (18), along with explicit
assumptions about the counterfactual probability of exoneration
for those who were executed or resentenced to prison, to develop
a sensitivity analysis for the Kaplan­Meier estimate of the cu-
mulative exoneration rate. First, we estimate the cumulative
incidence of exoneration subject to the competing risks of ex-
ecution and resentencing by 21.4 y after conviction, on the as-
sumption that censoring by recency, suicide, or natural death
was independent of these three event processes. The estimates
of the probabilities of removal from risk of exoneration by
exoneration under threat of execution, by execution itself, or by
resentencing, are 2.2% (1.7%, 2.7%), 23.8% (22.3%, 25.3%),
and 48.3% (46.7%, 50.0%), respectively. Thus, a defendant
sentenced to death had an estimated 2.2% chance of being
exonerated while under threat of execution by 21.4 y after
conviction, assuming those executed or resentenced had zero
chance of being exonerated (i.e., allowing for the competing
risks of execution and resentencing) (SI Materials and Methods,
section 3).
Consider instead the assumption that, had they remained on
death row, (i) those who were executed would have had zero
chance of exoneration, and (ii) those who were resentenced
would have had twice the chance of exoneration as the entire
population of defendants sentenced to death. This yields the
following estimate of the cumulative probability of exoneration,
had those who were exonerated or resentenced instead remained
on death row: 2.2% + 0 (23.8%) + 2 (2.2%) (48.3%) = 4.4%.
Using the Delta method, the confidence interval for this estimate
is 3.41­5.28%, assuming that the cumulative incidences of ex-
oneration and resentencing have zero covariance.
A zero probability of exoneration for executed defendants had
they remained on death row is necessarily, for the purposes of
this estimate, a conservative assumption. We believe that the
assumed probability of exoneration for those who were removed
from death row and resentenced to prison, twice the mean for
the population, is reasonable. We conclude that the Kaplan­
Meier estimate we obtained is conservative. Indeed the same
result we would obtain if we assume that the probability
of exoneration for those resentenced to prison, had they
remained on death row, is equal to or greater than 1.77 times
the population average [2.2% + 0 (23.8%) + 1.77 (2.2%)
(48.3%) = 4.1%].
Estimating false convictions from exonerations. Because there is no
general method to accurately determine innocence in a criminal
case, we use a proxy, exoneration: an official determination that
a convicted defendant is no longer legally culpable for the crime
for which he was condemned. There will be misclassifications.
Some exonerated defendants are guilty of the crimes for which
they were sentenced to death. We expect that such errors are
rare, given the high barriers the American legal system imposes
on convicted defendants in persuading authorities to reconsider
their guilt (1­3, 7) (SI Materials and Methods, section 4). To date,
one such case has come to light, and has been reclassified (19).
Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the effect of such mis-
classifications on the cumulative rate of exoneration is linear: If
10% of exonerated defendants were in fact guilty, the mean
cumulative rate of innocence for death-sentenced defendants
would be 3.7% rather than 4.1% (95% confidence interval of
3.3­4.0%); if 20% were guilty, the mean rate would be 3.3%
(95% confidence interval of 2.8­3.7%) (SI Materials and Meth-
ods, section 3).
On the other side, some innocent defendants who remained
on death row for more than 21.4 y but were not exonerated are
misclassified as guilty. Some may still be exonerated; some may
be executed; and most will likely die in prison, on death row or
off, of natural causes or suicide. In the absence of better data we
assume that the probability of a legal campaign to exonerate any
prisoner under threat of death who has a plausible innocence
claim is 1, and we assume that the probability of success for an
innocent prisoner who remains under such threat for at least
21.4 y is also 1. These are necessarily conservative assumptions.
To the extent that these probabilities are in fact less than 1, our
estimate will understate the actual rate of false convictions.
The distribution of possible misclassifications is asymmetrical:
216 defendants remained on death row longer than 21.4 y, whereas
only 107 were exonerated under threat of execution. Unless the
process of death row exoneration is assumed to be unrealistically
thorough, it is likely that the number of innocent death-sentenced
defendants misclassified as guilty exceeds the number of guilty
defendants exonerated under threat of execution and misclassified
as innocent. [The proxy we use (the exoneration rate) is also im-
portant in its own right: It is a direct measure of the rate of death
sentencing of defendants later determined to be legally not guilty.]
Taken together, the sensitivity analysis and the likely net
effects of misclassification both point in the same direction and
suggest that our 4.1% estimate of the rate of false conviction
among death-sentenced defendants is conservative.
Discussion
We present a conservative estimate of the proportion of erro-
neous convictions of defendants sentenced to death in the
United States from 1973 through 2004, 4.1%. This is a unique
finding; there are no other reliable estimates of the rate of false
conviction in any context. The main source of potential bias is
the accuracy of our classification of cases as true or false con-
victions. On that issue it is likely that we have an undercount,
that there are more innocent death row defendants who have not
been identified and exonerated than guilty ones who have been
exonerated in error.
The most charged question in this area is different: How many
innocent defendants have been put to death (6)? We cannot
estimate that number directly but we believe it is comparatively
A reviewer of an earlier draft suggested an alternative analytic approach. The suggested
approach postulates a campaign process that gives some but not all death-sentenced
defendants the opportunity to be exonerated. Identification of the false conviction rate
is then based on independence assumptions between innocence and removal from
death row. With more complete data of the sort required for the best realization of
this insightful approach, we believe that it would offer a particularly valuable supple-
ment, and test of the robustness, of our findings and conclusions.

low. If the rate were the same as our estimate for false death
sentences, the number of innocents executed in the United
States in the past 35 y would be more than 50 (20). We do not
believe that has happened. Our data and the experience of
practitioners in the field both indicate that the criminal justice
system goes to far greater lengths to avoid executing innocent
defendants than to prevent them from remaining in prison in-
definitely. One way to do so is to disproportionately reverse
death sentences in capital cases in which the accuracy of the
defendants' convictions is in doubt and to resentence them to life
imprisonment, a practice that makes our estimate of the rate of
error conservative. However, no process of removing potentially
innocent defendants from the execution queue can be foolproof.
With an error rate at trial over 4%, it is all but certain that
several of the 1,320 defendants executed since 1977 were in-
nocent (21).
It is possible that the death-sentencing rate of innocent
defendants has changed over time. No specific evidence points in
that direction, but the number and the distribution of death
sentences have changed dramatically in the past 15 y (22). One
change, however, is unlikely to have much impact: the advent of
DNA identification technology. DNA evidence is useful pri-
marily in rape rather than homicide investigations. Only 13% of
death row exonerations since 1973 (18 of 142) resulted from
postconviction DNA testing (13), so the availability of pre-
conviction testing will have at most a modest effect on that rate.
Unfortunately, we cannot generalize from our findings on
death sentences to the rate of false convictions in any broader
category of crime. Capital prosecutions, and to a lesser extent
murder cases in general, are handled very differently from other
criminal cases. There are theoretical reasons to believe that the
rate of false conviction may be higher for murders in general,
and for capital murders in particular, than for other felony
convictions, primarily because the authorities are more likely to
pursue difficult cases with weak evidence of guilt if one or more
people have been killed (23). However, there are no data that
confirm or refute this hypothesis.
We do know that the rate of error among death sentences is
far greater than Justice Scalia's reassuring 0.027% (6). That
much is apparent directly from the number of death row exon-
erations that have already occurred. Our research adds the
disturbing news that most innocent defendants who have been
sentenced to death have not been exonerated, and many--
including the great majority of those who have been resen-
tenced to life in prison--probably never will be.
This is only part of a disturbing picture. Fewer than half of all
defendants who are convicted of capital murder are ever sen-
tenced to death in the first place (e.g., 49.1% in Missouri as in
ref. 24, 29% in Philadelphia as in ref. 25, and 31% in New Jersey
as in ref. 26). Sentencing juries, like other participants in the
process, worry about the execution of innocent defendants.
Interviews with jurors who participated in capital sentencing
proceedings indicate that lingering doubts about the defendant's
guilt is the strongest available predictor of a sentence of life
imprisonment rather than death (27). It follows that the rate of
innocence must be higher for convicted capital defendants who
are not sentenced to death than for those who are. The net result
is that the great majority of innocent defendants who are con-
victed of capital murder in the United States are neither exe-
cuted nor exonerated. They are sentenced, or resentenced to
prison for life, and then forgotten.
