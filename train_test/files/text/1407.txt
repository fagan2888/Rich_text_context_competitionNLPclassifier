OBJECTIVE -- To describe the distribution of HbA1c
levels among children and young adults
in the U.S. and to evaluate the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parental
history of diabetes, overweight, and serum glucose on HbA1c
levels.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed HbA1c
data from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988­1994, for 7,968 participants aged
5­24 years who had not been treated for diabetes. After adjusting for the complex sample design,
we compared the distributions of HbA1c
in subgroups and developed multiple linear regression
models to examine factors associated with HbA1c
.
RESULTS -- Mean HbA1c
level was 4.99% (SD 0.50%) and varied from 4.93% (95%
CI 0.04) in non-Hispanic whites to 5.05% (0.02) in Mexican-Americans to 5.17% (0.02)
in non-Hispanic blacks. There were very small differences among subgroups. Within each age-
group, among men and women, among overweight and nonoverweight subjects, and at any level
of education, mean HbA1c
levels were higher in non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic
whites. After adjusting for confounders, HbA1c
levels for non-Hispanic blacks (5.15%, 95% CI
0.04) and Mexican-Americans (5.01%, 0.04) were higher than those for non-Hispanic
whites (4.93%, 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS -- These data provide national reference levels for HbA1c
distributions
among Americans aged 5­24 years and show statistically significant racial/ethnic differences in
HbA1c
levels that are not completely explained by demographic and health-related variables.

Concentration of HbA1c
is an indica-
tor of average blood glucose concen-
tration over the preceding 2­3
months. HbA1c
is currently considered
the best index of metabolic control for di-
abetic patients in clinical settings (1,2)
and participants in epidemiological stud-
ies as well as a measure of risk for the
development of micro- and macrovascu-
lar complications (3,4). HbA1c
concentra-
tion is also related to prevalent coronary
disease or carotid intimal thickening in
nondiabetic individuals (5,6). It has been
suggested as a diagnostic and screening
tool for diabetes in the general population
(7­9). The use of this test and the distri-
bution of HbA1c
levels are also being used
increasingly by quality assurance pro-
grams to assess the quality of diabetes care
(10).
Although the normative distribution
for HbA1c
levels has been described and
standardized for adults (11), normal
ranges for children have not been estab-
lished. Diabetes in children and adoles-
cents is on the rise, perhaps due to the
increase in type 2 diabetes (12) and pos-
sibly type 1 diabetes (13). With the in-
crease in diabetes in children and the
accompanying increased use of HbA1c
concentration as a glycemic indicator, it is
important to develop reference levels and
standards for HbA1c
for this population.
Here, we describe the distribution of
HbA1c
levels in a nationally representative
sample of U.S. children, adolescents, and
young adults aged 5­24 years. We also
evaluate the effects of age, sex, ethnicity,
socioeconomic status (SES), parental his-
tory of diabetes, overweight, and blood
glucose on the distribution of HbA1c
.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) was conducted from 1988
to 1994 by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) to assess the
health and nutritional status of the U.S.
population (14). The NHANES III in-
cluded a nationally representative proba-
bility sample of the U.S. civilian
noninstitutionalized population, identi-
fied through a complex multistage cluster
sampling design, with oversampling of
young people, non-Hispanic blacks, and
Mexican-Americans. During a household
interview, participants or a proxy respon-
dent for children provided information
on participants' sociodemographics,
health status, and family medical history.
Physicians and health care technicians
conducted a standard examination on
sampled subjects in a mobile examination
center within 4 weeks of the household
interview.

The NHANES III collected several in-
dicators of SES: the educational attain-
ment of the head of household (defined as
the family member 17 years of age who
owned or rented the dwelling), income,
and occupation. We used education as a
proxy for SES because unlike income
data, education data in NHANES III were
relatively complete. We also used the
poverty income ratio so that we could an-
alyze across the 6 years of the survey in a
comparable manner (14).
For this analysis, we defined race/
ethnicity as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican-American, and
other race (including other Hispanics,
Asians, and Native Americans). For the
total U.S. estimates, all racial/ethnic
groups were combined. BMI was calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared. BMI percentiles
were calculated on the basis of the CDC
growth charts (15). We defined over-
weight as the age- and sex-specific BMI
exceeding the 95th percentile.
HbA1c
was measured on whole blood
from participants 4 years of age with an
ion-exchange high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) method (Bio-
Rad Diamat HPLC; interassay coefficient
of variation 2.0). Because the presence of
variant hemoglobins (hemoglobins C, D,
F, and S) interfere with the HPLC
method, NHANES III analysts used the
standardized affinity chromatographic
method when these hemoglobins were
present. Both methods were standardized
to the Diabetes Control and Complica-
tions Trial reference method. Serum glu-
cose levels of participants 12 years of
age were measured as part of a standard
battery of biochemical assessments (Hita-
chi Model 737 multichannel analyzer;
Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN)
(16).
Of the 9,401 NHANES III respon-
dents aged 5­24 years who were inter-
viewed and examined, 13% (n  1,218)
did not have their HbA1c
levels measured.
There were no major differences in HbA1c
completion rate by sex, overweight, or ed-
ucation level. The completion rate varied
with age (78% in the age group 5­9 years
and 95% in the age group 20­24 years;
P  0.01) and race/ethnicity (90% among
Mexican-Americans, 89% among non-
Hispanic whites, and 86% among non-
Hispanic blacks; P  0.01). Pregnant
women (n  185) and respondents who
reported current treatment for diabetes
(n  20) were excluded from analysis.
Statistical analysis
We performed analyses for this study us-
ing SAS for data management and
SUDAAN to account for unequal proba-
bilities of selection, planned oversam-
pling, differential nonresponse, and the
complex sample design (17,18). We used
pairwise comparisons to test for the sig-
nificant mean differences in HbA1c
levels
among different groups. We used multi-
ple linear regression models to describe
the relationship of HbA1c
levels with the
following independent variables: age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education level, and over-
weight. Separate regression models were
run for each age group due to the consis-
tent significant age and sex interaction.
Additional models that controlled for fast-
ing glucose levels included the 2,809 chil-
dren and young adults 12 years of age
who had fasting glucose levels measured
after fasting for 8 h.
RESULTS -- A total of 7,974 children,
adolescents, and young adults aged 5­24
years who were not treated for diabetes
had their HbA1c
levels measured. The
mean age was 15 years, 49% were men,
and 11% were overweight. Of subjects,
25% had not completed high school,
34% had completed high school only,
and 41% had 12 years of education.
White youths were more likely to be from
homes having higher levels of education
and higher income than youths of other
races. More than 40% of non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican-Americans lived be-
low the poverty level compared with only
15% of non-Hispanic whites. The preva-
lence of overweight was higher among
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-
Americans (15% for both) than among
non-Hispanic whites (10%).
The distribution of HbA1c
levels by
race/ethnicity is shown in Fig. 1. The dis-
tribution of HbA1c
levels was slightly
higher among non-Hispanic blacks than
among Mexican-Americans and non-
Hispanic whites.
Overall sex-related differences in
HbA1c
means levels (5.02% in men vs.
4.95% in women) were significant (P 
0.01) but very small. Participants 10­14
years of age, non-Hispanic blacks, over-
weight participants, those of low SES, and
those with a positive parent history of di-
abetes had a statistically higher mean
HbA1c
level than their counterparts (P 
0.01 for each) (Table 1). Among the 2,809
youths whose fasting serum glucose levels
were measured, those with fasting serum
glucose 126 mg/dl had a higher mean
HbA1c
level than those with fasting glu-
cose 110­125 mg/dl or those with fasting
glucose 110 mg/dl (6.9, 5.1, and 4.9%,
respectively). However, the magnitude of
these mean differences was generally
small (range 0.05­0.23%).
Mean HbA1c
levels were highest
among non-Hispanic blacks for both
sexes and in every age group (P  0.01).

Participants aged 10­14 years had the
highest mean HbA1c
levels compared
with other age groups, except for Mexi-
can-American males, among whom mean
HbA1c
levels continuously increased with
age (P  0.01), and non-Hispanic black
males, among whom HbA1c
levels were
higher in age groups 10­14 and 20­24
years (P  0.05) (Fig. 2). Mean HbA1c
levels were higher among overweight
than nonoverweight participants in all age
and race/ethnic groups (P  0.01). The
difference in mean HbA1c
levels between
overweight and nonoverweight study
participants was more pronounced
among non-Hispanic blacks (Fig. 3).
In our multiple linear regression anal-
ysis, the factors associated with a higher
HbA1c
level were age 10­14 years (P 
0.01), male sex (P  0.01), non-Hispanic
black race (P  0.001), Mexican-
American ethnicity (P  0.01), positive
parent history of diabetes (P  0.01), and
overweight (P  0.01). However, even
when all previously mentioned factors
were included in the model, the HbA1c
level was still poorly explained (R2 
0.06) by these variables. In a model addi-
tionally controlled for fasting glucose
(n  2,809, R2  0.1), non-Hispanic
blacks still had a higher HbA1c
level than
other racial/ethnic groups. Furthermore,
HbA1c
increased with increasing fasting
glucose (P  0.01).
When we fit separate models for each
age, male subjects had significantly higher
HbA1c
levels than female subjects only in
the age groups 15­19 (P  0.01) and
20­24 years (P  0.03). Non-Hispanic
blacks had higher HbA1c
levels than non-
Hispanic whites in all age groups (P 
0.01), and Mexican-Americans had
higher HbA1c
levels than non-Hispanic
whites in all age groups except 5­9 years
(P  0.01). Education less than or equal
to high school (P  0.01) was associated
with a high HbA1c
level among those aged
20­24 years only, whereas overweight
was a significant factor among the 10- to
14-year-old subjects only (P  0.01).
CONCLUSIONS -- This report pro-
vides national reference values for HbA1c
distribution among subjects aged 5­24
years in the U.S. who were evaluated by
age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, paren-
tal history of diabetes, overweight, and
glucose status. In general, HbA1c
levels
were higher in the 10- to 14-year-old age
group and higher among overweight par-
ticipants, those with lower levels of edu-
cation (among 20- to 24-year-old age
group), those with a positive parental his-

tory of diabetes, and those with serum
glucose 126 mg/dl than in others. We
also found consistent differences in
HbA1c
levels among the different racial/
ethnic groups studied, with non-Hispanic
blacks having the highest levels, followed
by Mexican-Americans and whites, and
these differences were not accounted for
by other demographic or clinical factors.
Such differences in HbA1c
levels, which
are modest and mostly within a normal
range, can be interpreted in several ways.
On one hand, such differences may reflect
physiological differences in HbA1c
metabo-
lism that could be related to genetic or other
factors. HbA1c
is actually influenced by
both the life span of the erythrocyte and its
permeability to glucose (19­21). On the
other hand, differences in HbA1c
may also
reflecthigheraverageglycemiaoverthepre-
ceding 2­3 months (which may also be
physiological and within normal limits), or
the differences may reflect some level of rel-
ative insulin resistance. Indeed, an elevated
HbA1c
level has been associated with excess
mortality risk in the general population
(22).
In this healthy U.S. population, non-
Hispanic black youths consistently had
higher HbA1c
levels than non-Hispanic
white youths, even after data were ad-
justed for age, sex, education, overweight,
and fasting glucose level. Considering the
disproportionate rise in type 2 diabetes in
minority children (23­27), these differ-
ences in HbA1c
are noteworthy. We also
described significant differences in HbA1c
levels associated with age, sex, weight,
and education. These differences were
significant in some specific subgroups
only. The effects of age on HbA1c
levels in
adults are controversial, as some studies
show age-related increases in HbA1c
lev-
els and others show little or no increase
(28, 29). Differences in results among the
studies are likely related to differences in
the selection of study subjects. In most
ethnic and sex groups, we found mean
HbA1c
levels highest in the group aged
10­14 years. This may reflect the demon-
strated transient increase in insulin resis-
tance experienced at the onset of puberty
and the return to near prepubertal insulin
sensitivity level by the end of puberty
(30). In NHANES III, low level of educa-
tion was associated with high HbA1c
lev-
els in the overall population; however,
when we fitted separated models by age-
group, the association persisted only
among the 20- to 24-year age group. The
absence of significant relationship in the
younger age groups may be because the
level of education was that of the head of
the household, most likely a parent,
whereas in the oldest group, the educa-
tion level was that of the youth.
Our study has several strengths and
limitations. The NHANES III is a nation-
ally representative sample that over-
sampled black and Mexican-American
children, the two largest racial/ethnic mi-
nority groups in the U.S. Some results
should, however, be interpreted with cau-
tion. The exclusion of youth with diabetes
was based on participant response to a
question about use of insulin or glucose
regulators; however, the validity of data
based on responses to such questions is
very high. More importantly, the survey
did not have compatible physical activity
questions for youths aged 8­16 years,
and physical activity is a major potential
confounder for insulin sensitivity and po-
tentially for glucose and HbA1c
levels.
These factors may well play a role in the
observed ethnic differences as well as
other differences in HbA1c
levels.
In conclusion, we have provided na-
tional reference values for HbA1c
distribu-
tion among individuals aged 5­24 years
in the U.S. The physiopathological mean-
ing of differences in HbA1c
levels within a
normal range, however, is not estab-
lished. Although we found small differ-

groups, we believe that these data may not
support the need for separate norms.
