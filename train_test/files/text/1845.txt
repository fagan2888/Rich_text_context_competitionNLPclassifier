Background--Updated guidelines from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III stratify
patients into 5 groups of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk that determine intensity of lipid-lowering therapy. The
present study assesses the distribution of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the United States across the 5
groups of CHD risk as defined in the updated guidelines.
Methods and Results--Subjects included 7399 individuals 20 to 79 years of age in the 1999 to 2002 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey representing 171 million individuals in the United States. CHD risk, LDL-C
levels, and goal achievement were determined per Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. CHD risk assessment
incorporated a medical condition review, risk factor summation, and Framingham Risk Score calculation.
Percentages were weighted to represent population estimates, and SEs were adjusted for the survey design. The
distribution of individuals by CHD risk included 61.1% at lower risk, 10.6% at high risk, and 5.7% at very high
risk. From Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, only 5.4% of the population was at "intermediate" risk. Two thirds
(66.3%) met their Adult Treatment Panel III­defined LDL-C goal. Of those at high and very high risk, 23% and
26%, respectively, met the goal of LDL-C 100 mg/dL, whereas only 3.1% and 4.6% had an LDL-C 70 mg/dL
(or non­high-density lipoprotein C 100 mg/dL).
Conclusions--Most adult US residents are at lower 10-year CHD risk and meet risk-adjusted LDL-C goals. However, large
portions of the high-risk population are undertreated. The commonly described population at intermediate risk is small.
A novel method of identifying patients who might benefit from additional testing to determine their treatment strategy
is provided. (Circulation. 2007;115:1363-1370.)
Key Words: cardiovascular diseases  cholesterol  guidelines  lipids  risk factors
The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treat-
ment Panel (ATP III) guidelines provided a detailed
process for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment
based on the presence of high-risk medical conditions, the
presence or absence of 5 risk factors (RFs), and the Framing-
ham Risk Score (FRS).1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) goals and appropriate therapy were individualized
for each of 4 risk groups. A recent update added a fifth "very
high-risk" group, decreased the LDL-C goal for the 3 highest-
risk groups, and increased its complexity.2 Previous studies
used older data and/or older guidelines to estimate the
distribution of cardiac risk3 and lipid levels in the United
States.4,5
Clinical Perspective p 1370
A recent study focused on the sizes of CHD risk groups and
achievement of LDL-C goals; however, it did not address an
important group of patients, those considered at "intermedi-
ate" risk.6 The size of this group is a matter of clinical and
economic importance. Without an accurate understanding of
the numbers of individuals in the United States at intermedi-
ate risk, policies for additional screening with new imaging or
blood tests7 cannot be assessed for their impact on clinical
practice and healthcare costs.

distribution of LDL-C across the 5 levels of CHD risk defined
in the updated ATP III guidelines. We evaluated the clinical
impact of each step in the risk assessment algorithm by
estimating the number of individuals for whom that step
defined a CHD risk level. We then substratified the 5 risk
groups by 6 LDL-C levels to create a 30-cell matrix. This
matrix allowed visual integration of cardiac risk and LDL-C
levels to identify the population most in need of further
evaluation for best treatment decisions.
Methods
Participants and Exclusions
NHANES is conducted in 2-year phases of health interviews,
physical examinations, and laboratory testing at a mobile exam-
ination center. Through the use of demographic and geographical
data, weights are assigned to each subject so that their sum
represents the entire civilian noninstitutionalized US population.
The present study uses data from all subjects 20 to 79 years of age
from 2 phases: 1999 to 2000 and 2001 to 2002. NHANES has
published a detailed account of its methods and protocols
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).
Subjects were excluded if they currently were pregnant, received
cancer chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the examination, or lacked
cholesterol or blood pressure data to allow risk assessment and
LDL-C stratification (Table 1).
High-Risk Diagnosis and RF Definitions
For the purposes of the present study, definitions of risk diagnoses
and RFs use available NHANES data fields (see the Appendix in the
online Data Supplement) and are described below. The 4 diagnoses
that classify a subject as high risk include the following:
 CHD: Subjects who reported being told by a healthcare profes-
sional that they had a myocardial infarction, heart attack, coronary
artery disease, or angina pectoris. Subjects were considered to
have "hard" CHD if they had CHD defined by a condition other
than angina pectoris alone.
 Diabetes mellitus (DM): Subjects who reported being told by a
healthcare professional that they had DM, reported taking insulin
or oral hypoglycemic medications, had a random blood glucose
200 mg/dL, or had a fasting (8 hours before venipuncture)
blood glucose 126 mg/dL.8
 Peripheral vascular disease: Ankle brachial index 0.9 in either
leg.
 Cerebrovascular disease: Subjects who reported history of a
stroke.
The 5 standard ATP III RFs used to risk stratify subjects include
the following:
 Advanced age: Men 45 years; women 55 years.
 Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C): 40 mg/dL
(60 mg/dL counts as a negative RF).
 Hypertension: Systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, diastolic
blood pressure 90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive
medication.
 Cigarette smoking: Currently smoking every day or some days and
reported having smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.5
 Family history: NHANES variable MCQ250G, family history of
premature CHD in subjects reporting a heart attack or angina in
grandparents, parents, or siblings 50 years of age.
Metabolic syndrome is used to subclassify those at very high risk
and was present if a subject met at least 3 of the following 5 criteria:
 Waist circumference 102 cm in men or 88 cm in women. If
waist circumference was not available, body mass index 30
kg/m2 was substituted for this diagnostic criterion.9,10
 Fasting triglycerides 150 mg/dL or random triglycerides 400
mg/dL.
 HDL-C 40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women.
 Blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive
medication.
 Fasting glucose 100 mg/dL.9,11
Framingham Risk Score
The FRS is a standard method to assess cardiovascular risk.1,12 Seven
components are used to estimate the 10-year risk of CHD events
(heart attack or CHD death). The mathematical functions used were
provided by the Framingham study by personal communication
(L.M. Sullivan, PhD, and R.B. D'Agostino, Sr, PhD, written com-
munication, 2002).
Definitions of Risk Levels
Subjects were classified into risk levels using the ATP III
guidelines2:
 Very high risk: Subjects with CHD and 1 of the following: DM,
cigarette smoking, the metabolic syndrome, and/or 3 ATP III
RFs.
 High risk: Subjects with CHD, peripheral vascular disease, cere-
brovascular disease, and/or DM or with 2 ATP III RFs and
10-year FRS 20%. This group excludes those with the combi-
nations above defined as very high risk.
 Moderately high risk: Subjects with no high-risk diagnoses, 2
ATP III RFs, and FRS of 10% to 20%. This group is commonly
referred to as intermediate risk.

LDL-C and Non­HDL-C Calculation and
Goal Assignment
For the subjects (n4560; population, 105.8 million; 61.9%) with a
fasting cholesterol panel and triglycerides 400 mg/dL, LDL-C was
calculated from the Friedewald equation.13 They were stratified by
LDL-C into 1 of 6 groups: 70, 70 to 99, 100 to 129, 130 to 159, 160
to 189, and 190 mg/dL (Figure 1). For subjects with laboratory
fasting times 8.5 hours (n2712),14 triglycerides 400 mg/dL
(n116), or missing fasting time (n10) or triglyceride data (n1),
the secondary goal of non­HDL-C was calculated. Subjects were
stratified into the same 6 groups by the use of thresholds correspond-
ing to the respective ATP III goals for non­HDL-C (30 mg/dL higher
than LDL-C goals).2
The ATP III update uses the risk levels to define LDL-C (or
non­HDL-C) values for use as goals and thresholds for initiating
therapy.2 These goals and thresholds match the cut points for the 6
LDL-C (or non­HDL-C) groups (Figure 1 and Table 2).
Because LDL-C levels are associated with some variation or
uncertainty in treatment recommendations, we developed a novel
method to clarify risk based on need for treatment change, For
example, among patients with CHD with LDL-C between 70 and 99
mg/dL, therapy is described as "optional"2 or "reasonable."15 To
address this ambiguity, for each risk level, LDL-C (and non­HDL-C)
levels are defined as "change unnecessary" if below the range of
recommendations, "change necessary" if above levels requiring drug
therapy, and "consider change" when between these 2 levels.
Category assignment for this method of stratification is denoted by
cell color in Figures 1 and 2.
Statistical Analysis
Subject data were downloaded from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes.htm and imported into Microsoft Excel (version 11.2 for
Macintosh, Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Wash). Separate fields were
developed for each data point and clinical decision to model a virtual
prevention clinic addressing each individual subject. Subjects were
stratified by risk level and substratified by LDL-C or non­HDL-C
levels, and total individuals were computed in each category.
Population totals and percentages were calculated from the full-
sample 4-year mobile-examination-center weight for each subject,
which represents unbiased population estimates.16
The entire NHANES 1999 to 2002 mobile-examination-center
data set includes 19 759 subjects with a combined weight represent-
ing 278.7 million individuals. Restricting analysis to individuals 20
to 79 years of age resulted in the selection of 8747 subjects
representing 190.4 million US residents. After all exclusions, 7399
subjects made up the study sample, with a population weight of
171.010.6 million individuals (Table 1). The data set then was
imported into SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to calculate
SEs adjusted for the complex survey design. Data are presented as
population weighthalf-width of the 95% confidence interval.
Percentages were calculated using the denominator of 171.0 million
(the study population after exclusions).

Results
Distribution of CHD Risk
Subject distribution across the 5 risk levels includes 61.1% at
lower risk and 17.2% at moderate risk. Only 5.4% are at
moderately high risk (often referred to as intermediate risk),
10.6% are at high risk, and the remaining 5.7% are at very
high risk (Figure 1, right column). Of the 171 million
individuals, 5.3% are in the lowest group (LDL-C 70
mg/dL or non­HDL-C 100 mg/dL), and 5.7% are in the
highest (LDL-C 190 mg/dL or non­HDL-C 220 mg/dL).
The largest stratum (32.3%) is LDL-C 100 to 129 mg/dL (or
non­HDL-C 130 to 159 mg/dL) (Figure 1).
At least 1 high-risk criterion is required for inclusion in the
high- and very high-risk categories. Table 3 presents both the
number of individuals who meet each criterion and the number
for whom that criterion is the only definition of high-risk status.
Of the 28.0 million US residents at high or very high risk, nearly
half (48.2%) have DM, and 33.7% have DM alone. CHD is
present in only 34.6% of the high- and very high-risk groups
(Table 3). Multiple RFs and an FRS 20% is present in 20.9%,
whereas peripheral vascular disease (13.8%) and cerebrovascu-
lar disease (12.4%) are less common.
CHD Risk and Cholesterol Goals
Stratifying the 5 risk categories by the 6 LDL-C and non­
HDL-C levels creates a 30-cell matrix (Figures 1 and 2). All
subjects fit into a cell. Applying the LDL-C goals from ATP
III (Table 2) shows that 66.31.9% (113.47.8 million) are
at or below goal, whereas 33.71.9% (57.65.1 million) are
above goal.
The population can be divided into 3 clinical groups based
on the necessity of LDL-C reduction as follows:
 Change unnecessary: This group (green in Figures 1 and 2)
includes 107.77.4 million (63.02.0%) who meet even
the most aggressive goals for their risk category.
 Change necessary: This group (red in Figures 1 and 2)
includes 37.33.8 million (21.81.6%) who require
change in their LDL-C (or non­HDL-C) levels because
they are above more conservative thresholds for lifestyle
changes and drug therapy.
Figure 2. Color scale represents clinical need to lower LDL-C. Red indicates subjects who require change in their LDL-C levels to
achieve goals; yellow, subjects who may be candidates for change and would be considered for noninvasive testing; and green, sub-
jects who meet their LDL-C goals.

 Consider change: This group (yellow in Figures 1 and 2)
has LDL-C between aggressive and conservative treatment
recommendations and numbers 26.02.8 million
(15.21.2%), a figure that includes 10.11.7 million from
the lower-risk group.
Discussion
The risk assessment process defined by ATP III includes
identification of high-risk medical conditions, enumeration of
major RFs, and calculation of the FRS when appropriate.
Cholesterol goals are linked to estimates of absolute CHD
risk.1,2 Therefore, making individualized LDL-C treatment
recommendations requires consideration of both CHD risk
and the LDL-C level. The matrix in Figure 1 provides several
insights into the risk assessment process.
High- and Very High-Risk Individuals
There are 18.1 million individuals at high risk and 9.8 million
at very high risk.2 Restricting to those with known CHD
(including angina) identifies only 35% (9.7 million) of the 2
highest-risk groups. Hard CHD alone would identify only
29% (8.0 of 28.0 million).
ATP III expanded the definition of high risk to include
"CHD-equivalent" conditions, nearly tripling its size. The
diagnosis of DM is made in 13.5 million, 34% of whom are
at high risk by this diagnosis alone. High risk is uniquely
defined in 3.4 million because of 2 RFs and an FRS 20%,
2.0 million because of a low ankle brachial index, and 1.4
million because of stroke history. These findings have im-
portant implications for clinics that assess cardiac risk.
Failure to routinely measure ankle brachial indices, calculate
FRS, or recognize patients in the very high-risk category may
lead clinicians to underestimate cardiac risk in up to 11.1 of
28.0 million high- and very high-risk individuals.
Current cholesterol treatment guidelines maintain the
LDL-C goal of 100 mg/dL and define LDL-C 70 mg/dL
as optional2 or reasonable,15 with particular emphasis on
those at very high risk. Only 4.6% of very high-risk and 3.1%
of high-risk individuals have LDL-C 70 mg/dL. For these 2
groups, 75.8% (21.1 million) have LDL-C 100 mg/dL and
are not meeting the more conservative cholesterol goals
(Figure 1).2,15
Not all authors or groups define the very high-risk group
similarly. A recent national survey observed that 75% of
patients with cardiovascular disease were at very high risk.17
They defined "multiple major RFs" as 2 compared with 3
in the present study. Repeating their analysis with a 3-RF
threshold, we find that 67.3% of US residents with known
cardiovascular disease are at very high risk. Defining "mul-
tiple RFs" as 2 RFs increases the same measure to 82.4%.
Better clarity of very high risk definition may be needed to
improve the utility of such comparisons.
Lower Risk
The next step in ATP III risk assessment is counting RFs and
assigning those with 2 to the lower-risk category. We found
that 61.1% (104.56.7 million) were at lower risk. These
individuals have an LDL-C goal of 160 mg/dL; 86%
(90.35.9 million) achieved it.
When the RF count establishes lower-risk status, clinicians
must not reflexively assume that lipid treatment remains
unnecessary. Of US residents, 4.10.8 million lower-risk
individuals have LDL-C 190 mg/dL (or non­HDL-C 220
mg/dL) for whom guidelines recommend medical therapy.
An additional 10.11.7 million are above the LDL-C goal of
160 mg/dL and are candidates for lifestyle modifications and
consideration of medical therapy. This combined group is
larger than the moderately high- or very high-risk groups.
Omitting HDL-C 60 mg/dL as a negative RF moves
8.01.0% (8.31.2 million) out of the lower-risk group,
7.21.2 million become moderate risk, and 1.10.3 million
become moderately high risk on the basis of the FRS.
Accordingly, 3.60.6 million (3.50.5% of the initial lower-
risk group) receive a new LDL-C goal with this omission.
A broader question about the lower-risk group is how to
assess the relative importance of RF counting versus the FRS.
Although ATP III does not require it, assessing the FRS in all
104.5 million individuals at lower risk by RFs identifies
9.41.6 million with an FRS 6% (a threshold some suggest
should trigger additional testing).7 A previous analysis dem-
onstrated that calculating the FRS before RF evaluation (an
option in ATP III) reclassified the risk of 6 million
individuals in the lower-risk group.18
Intermediate Risk and Use of the FRS
Without updated numbers that carefully apply guideline-
based risk stratification criteria, there have been widely
varying and potentially misleading estimates of the number of
individuals at intermediate risk, and guidelines recommend-
ing additional tests to assist with risk assessment have
incorporated these estimates. The ATP III guidelines do not
define an intermediate-risk group,1,2 but some have defined it
as subjects without high-risk conditions but with 2 RFs and
an FRS of 10% to 20%.7,19 This matches the ATP III
moderately high-risk group.2 Although 1 report20 estimated
that this group was 40% of the US population and others have
quoted this estimate,7 our study found just 5.4% at moder-
ately high risk. This finding suggests that previous reports
overestimated the number of patients considered to be at
intermediate risk. Low-risk patients were defined in 1 article
as having "a low-risk FRS [6%] and no major RFs outside
the desirable range."20 These authors estimated this group to
be 35% of the population. We applied these criteria to our
data set and found only 11.8 million subjects (6.9%) at low
risk by this definition.20 Subtracting the 17.9% of individuals
at high or very high risk would imply that the remaining
75.2% are at intermediate risk, 10-fold the size of the
moderately high-risk group in our analysis. Thus, the size of
this group is very sensitive to RF number and definitions.
For the purpose of considering additional testing, a recent
consensus conference expanded the definition of intermediate
risk to include an FRS of 6% to 20%.7 This definition change
alone approximately doubled the size of the intermediate-risk
group to 10.00.8% (17.12.0 million), which still is below
previous estimates.

After high-risk subjects have been assigned by medical
conditions and lower-risk subjects by RFs, ATP III recom-
mends assessment by the FRS. Although some recent re-
ports19,21 equate the entire risk assessment process with the
FRS by linking risk categories to the FRS, they are not the
same. In our study, after separating subjects with high-risk
conditions and those at lower risk by RFs, only 24.51.6%
(41.94.6 million) required FRS to determine their risk
status. Only 15.02.3% of the high-risk group and none of
the very high-risk group use the FRS for risk assignment.
This suggests that the FRS alone should not be considered a
substitute for the other components of the risk assessment
process.
Finding a Focused Group for Consideration of
Additional Testing
A growing body of literature addresses how new imaging and
blood tests may improve risk prediction.7,22,23 Subjects at
moderately high (intermediate) risk often are described as
those in greatest need of additional testing.7,22,23 However,
many in this risk group need no further evaluation to make
clear decisions about LDL-C treatment (Figure 1). Subjects
with LDL-C 130 mg/dL (70.54.4% of the moderately
high-risk group) exceed thresholds for both lifestyle changes
and drug therapy. Another 0.60.3 million (7.53.3% of
moderately high group) are below the more aggressive
threshold of 100 mg/dL and thus do not require further
LDL-C reduction. Only 2.10.5 million (22.04.3% of the
moderately high-risk group, 1.20.3% of the population)
have LDL-C of 100 to 129 mg/dL. Although this subset may
benefit from further diagnostic information, it is small.
Others who may benefit from additional evaluation include
high-risk patients with LDL-C 70 to 99 mg/dL who do not
receive clear treatment recommendations from the guidelines.
In addition, some lower- and moderate-risk patients have
thresholds for initiating drug therapy that are 30 mg/dL
higher than their LDL-C goals, creating a clinical scenario in
which the goal is not met but medications may not be clearly
indicated. For example, a 60-year-old woman with no other
RFs and an LDL-C of 185 mg/dL may pose a difficult
decision for the clinician because she is estimated to be at
lower risk but with a high LDL-C. This may not be a rare
clinical scenario because 10.11.7 million US residents fit
this narrow definition.
For additional testing, we suggest a novel method of
selection based on the following 3 categories:
 Change unnecessary: For these 107.7 million individuals
(63.2%), additional testing is unlikely to change treatment
recommendations (green in Figures 1 and 2).
 Consider change: This group of 26.0 million (15.2%) is
most likely to benefit from additional testing that might
reassign subjects into other risk groups (yellow in Figures
1 and 2).
 Change necessary: These 37.3 million individuals (21.8%)
should initiate therapeutic interventions without additional
testing (red in Figures 1 and 2). There may be situations in
which the initial therapy brings subjects into the "consider
change" level.
This categorization scheme combines the full risk assess-
ment process (medical condition review, RF summation, and
FRS calculation) with LDL-C levels and may provide better
guidance for individualized treatment and need for additional
testing.
Study Limitations
NHANES data are collected by examination, laboratory
testing, and interview and therefore are subject to sampling
and nonsampling errors. Interview data based on self-report
are subject to recall bias and misunderstanding of questions.
Additionally, NHANES does not include the incarcerated or
institutionalized populations of the United States.24
Some of the NHANES variables do not precisely match
those in the ATP III guidelines or clinical practice. For
instance, NHANES reports family history of CHD as a parent
or grandparent 50 years of age without gender distinction,
whereas ATP III recognizes family history as an RF if CHD
afflicts a male first-degree relative 55 years of age or a
female first-degree relative 65 years of age.1 We diagnosed
DM from a single glucose sample with different thresholds
based on the fasting time. A second sample and/or a glucose
tolerance test were not available. We included stroke as a
CHD risk equivalent. Some subjects with stroke match the
ATP III criteria of "symptomatic carotid disease," but others
likely experienced hemorrhagic or cardioembolic stokes with
less well-defined correlation to future cardiac risk. Thus, the
risk in the 1.40.5 million individuals (0.80.3%) desig-
nated high on the basis of a history of a stroke alone may be
overestimated. No test for aortic aneurysm or history of aortic
surgery is included in NHANES, so some CHD risk­equiva-
lent subjects may be unrecognized. Our definition of CHD
included 48 subjects representing 1.00.4 million individuals
(0.60.2%) for whom angina was the only high-risk diagno-
sis. Risk in this small subset may be overestimated by this
softer end point.
No data identifying recent acute coronary syndrome are
present, likely resulting in some subjects being classified as
high risk instead of very high risk. Furthermore, the definition
of the very high-risk group in ATP III is vague because it
includes, for example, "multiple" and "severe" RFs without
explicitly defining these terms.2
For subjects with short fasting times or triglycerides 400
mg/dL, we calculated non­HDL-C. Subjects then were as-
signed to the LDL-C level associated with the corresponding
non­HDL-C goal (30 mg/dL higher). This approach follows
the ATP III recommendation of using the non­HDL-C goal in
this situation.1 The NHANES data set does not provide
information on fibrate or niacin use, so some subjects might
not qualify for the latest metabolic syndrome criteria.25
Finally, the present study includes 4 years from NHANES,
which represent a sample of the country from a fixed range in
time. More recent data may be slightly different.
Despite these limitations, the estimates provided here are
similar to those independently published by a research group
from another institution.6 In addition to providing signifi-
cantly more detail on the number of Americans in the
different cardiovascular risk groups and their treatment status
by LDL-C goals, the present study adds unique information

describing how patients at high and very high risk qualified
for these designations. In addition, this discussion focuses
specifically on the number of patients at intermediate risk, the
implications of this designation for additional testing, and the
implications of errors in risk stratification.
Conclusions
The present study offers important information to policy
makers and those needing estimates of the size of the at-risk
population based on the presence of CHD, RFs, and LDL-C
levels. This study also provides 3 additions to the understand-
ing of cardiovascular risk assessment: (1) assessment of CHD
risk in the entire US population, (2) substratification of CHD
risk by levels of LDL-C, and (3) identification of clinical
groups oriented around the necessity of reducing LDL-C.
This study underscores the importance of a complete clinical
evaluation to accurately identify high-risk subjects rather than
using only the FRS.
The majority of the population (61%) is at lower risk as
defined by current guidelines. A significant percentage (34%)
of individuals from all risk levels has not met LDL-C goals.
The commonly described group of patients at intermediate
risk (5.4%) is much smaller than previously estimated and
contains few subjects for whom treatment recommendations
are not clear. A novel strategy for identifying patients who
may benefit most from additional testing is provided.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
The number of adult Americans who have achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals and are considered
at "intermediate" risk is a matter of clinical and economic importance. Without an accurate understanding of these
numbers, policies for new screening tests cannot be assessed for their impact on clinical practice and healthcare costs.
Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the present study shows that the majority of the
US population (61%) is at lower 10-year cardiac risk defined by current guidelines; however, a significant percentage
(34%) at all risk levels have not met LDL-C goals (57.65.1 million). Of those at high risk, only 23% had an LDL-C 100
mg/dL, and only 3.1% had an LDL-C 70 mg/dL. Of those at very high risk, only 26% had an LDL-C 100 mg/dL, and
only 4.6% had an LDL-C 70 mg/dL. The size of the commonly described group of patients at "intermediate risk" is much
lower than previous estimates (5.4% of the US population; 9.21.2 million) and contains only a small number of subjects
for whom treatment recommendations are not clear (2.10.5 million). The relative number of patients who may benefit
from additional testing is small (15%) but still represents 26 million Americans. A strategy for identifying patients who
may benefit most from additional testing to determine treatment recommendations is provided.
