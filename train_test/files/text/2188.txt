This article describes the design and phenotype and genotype data available for sibling pairs with varying
genetic relatedness in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is a
nationally representative longitudinal study of over 20,000 adolescents in the United States in 1994­1995
who have been followed for 15 years into adulthood. The Add Health design included oversamples of
more than 3,000 pairs of individuals with varying genetic resemblance, ranging from monozygotic twins,
dizygotic twins, full siblings, half siblings, and unrelated siblings who were raised in the same household.
Add Health sibling pairs are therefore nationally representative and followed longitudinally from early
adolescence into adulthood with four in-home interviews during the period 1994­2009. Add Health has
collected rich longitudinal social, behavioral, environmental, and biological data, as well as buccal cell DNA
from all sample members, including sibling pairs. Add Health has an enlightened dissemination policy
and to date has released phenotype and genotype data to more than 10,000 researchers in the scientific
community.
Keywords: Add Health, sibling pairs, genetic data, adolescence
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, or
Add Health, is an ongoing longitudinal study of a nation-
ally representative sample of more than 20,000 adolescents
in Grades 7­12 in the United States in 1994­1995 who
have been followed through adolescence and their transi-
tion to adulthood with four in-home interviews in 1995,
1996, 2001­2002, and most recently in 2008­2009 when
they were aged 24­32. Embedded within the design of Add
Health were oversamples of about 3,000 pairs of individu-
als with varying genetic relatedness, including monozygotic
(MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, full siblings, half siblings,
and adolescents with no biological relationship but who
were raised in the same household. Because all design fea-
tures of the Add Health Study (described below) relate to
the sibling pairs sub-sample, Add Health sibling pairs are
unique in that they are nationally representative, racially
and ethnically diverse, and have comprehensive social, en-
vironmental, behavioral, and biological longitudinal data
from early adolescence into adulthood.
AddHealthwasdevelopedinresponsetoamandatefrom
the United States Congress to fund a study of adolescent
health and was designed by a nation-wide team of multi-
disciplinary investigators from the social, behavioral, and
health sciences. The original purpose of Add Health was
to understand the causes of adolescent health and health
behavior, with special emphasis on the forces that reside in
the multiple contexts of adolescent life. Innovative features
of the research design facilitated this purpose by providing
independent measurements of the social environments of
adolescents, including contextual data on the family, neigh-
borhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and
romantic relationships. Data were gathered from adoles-
cents themselves, their parents, siblings, friends, romantic
partners, fellow students, and school administrators. Exist-
ing databases with information about the neighborhoods
and communities of the adolescents were merged with the
Add Health data.

The Add Health cohort was then followed through their
transitiontoadulthood,andresearchturnedtounderstand-
ing the determinants and consequences of developmental
and health trajectories from adolescence into adulthood.
Acrossallinterviewwaves,comprehensivelongitudinaldata
on health and health-related behavior were collected, in-
cluding life histories of physical activity, substance use,
sexual behavior, delinquency and violence, social and ro-
mantic relationships, cohabitation, marriage, childbearing,
civic engagement, education, and multiple indicators of
health status based on self-report (e.g., general health, men-
tal health, chronic illness), direct measurement (e.g., over-
weight status and obesity), and biological measures (e.g.,
from blood spots, urine, and saliva).
The study has been funded by three Program Projects
over the period 1994­2013 by the National Institutes of
Child Health and Human Development (P01 HD031921)
with co-funding from 23 other Federal agencies and na-
tional foundations. Add Health has become a national data
resource for over 10,000 Add Health researchers who have
obtained more than 500 independently funded research
grants and have produced thousands of peer-reviewed re-
search articles published in multiple disciplinary journals
and research outlets. Below we describe the design of Add
Health and its sibling pairs sub-sample, followed by the
types of data available, a summary of research findings, and
data access.
Add Health Design
Add Health used a school-based design that selected 80 high
schools and a paired feeder school from a stratified list of
all high schools in the United States in 1994. Schools were
stratified by region, urbanicity, school type (public, pri-
vate, parochial), ethnic mix, and size; 79% of the schools
contacted agreed to participate in the study. An in-school
questionnaire was administered to more than 90,000 stu-
dents in Grades 7­12 who attended these schools during
the 1994­1995 school year, and school administrators also
filled out a questionnaire about the school. The in-school
student questionnaire provided data on the school context,
friendship networks, school activities, future expectations,
and a variety of health conditions. An additional purpose
of the in-school questionnaire was to identify and select
special supplementary samples of individuals in rare but
theoretically crucial categories. It is this aspect of the design
that enabled Add Health to oversample twins and other sib-
ling pairs according to their genetic relatedness within this
nationally representative sampling frame.
Add Health obtained rosters of all enrolled students in
each school. From the union of students on school ros-
ters and students not on rosters who completed in-school
questionnaires, a gender- and grade-stratified core sample
of 200 adolescents was selected from each school pair for a
90-minute in-home interview as part of the Wave I inter-

view. The core in-home sample is essentially self-weighting,
and provides a nationally representative sample of 12,105
American adolescents in Grades 7­12. Twins and other sib-
ling pairs occur naturally in the core in-home sample pro-
portional to their representation in the general population
of adolescents in Grades 7­12 in the United States in 1995.
However, to increase the potential number of twins for
genetic analysis, twins and other sibling pairs were over-
sampled for the in-home sample, based on responses from
the in-school survey.
Sibling Pairs Recruitment
From answers provided in the in-school survey, Add Health
drew supplemental samples based on the genetic related-
ness of siblings in a household. If an adolescent indicated
that he or she was a twin in the in-school survey, they were
selected with certainty (e.g., 100%) for inclusion in the in-
home Wave I sample. Full siblings occur naturally in large
numbers in the core in-home sample, but half siblings and
unrelated adolescents (e.g., stepsiblings, foster and adopted
children, adolescents in group homes) who participated in
the in-school survey (i.e., were in Grades 7­12 in 1994­
1995) and lived in the same household were also oversam-
pled. Table 1 shows the number of pairs of adolescents in
the sibling pairs sub-sample who were interviewed in home
at Wave I. This sub-sample includes more than 3,000 pairs
of adolescents who have varying degrees of genetic relat-
edness and represent a fully articulated behavioral genetic
design. These pairs of adolescents took the same question-
naires, share the same home environment, and share, in
most cases, the same school and neighborhood environ-
ment. The embedded sibling pairs design in Add Health
and the data available for sibling pairs are unprecedented
for a US study of this magnitude. In all follow-up inter-
views, high priority has been placed on locating and re-
interviewing sibling pairs to maintain the integrity of this
sub-sample for longitudinal research purposes.
In addition to the sibling pairs sample, supplemental
samples were also drawn based on ethnicity (Cuban, Puerto
Rican, and Chinese) and physical disability. Add Health also
oversampled African American adolescents with highly ed-
ucated parents to provide sufficient cell sizes for analyses
broken down by race and socio-economic status. Finally,

Note: Response rates are based on the following denominator and numerator: a pair was considered eligible
if one member met the requirements for interview selection (note this eligibility changes over waves due
to death or overseas location); only one member of the pair needed to be interviewed for the pair to be
included in response category.
a special `saturated' sample was included in Wave I by se-
lecting all enrolled students from two large schools and 14
small schools for in-home interviews. Complete social net-
work data were collected in the saturated field-settings by
generating a large number of romantic and friendship pairs
forwhichbothmembersofthepairhadin-homeinterviews.
These data provide unbiased and complete coverage of the
social networks and romantic partnerships in which adoles-
cents are embedded. A parent, usually the resident mother,
also completed a 30-minute interviewer-assisted interview
at Wave I. The core sample plus the special samples pro-
duced a sample size of 20,745 adolescents interviewed in
the home at Wave I with a response rate of 78.9%. The
Wave I in-home sample represents the national cohort that
is followed prospectively through time, and thus this inno-
vative design remains a major strength of the longitudinal
data as well.
Longitudinal Design
The Wave I in-home adolescent cohort has been followed
up with three subsequent in-home interviews spanning 15
years. In 1996, all adolescents in Grades 7 through 11 in
Wave I and 12th graders who were part of the sibling pairs
sub-sample were re-interviewed for the Wave II in-home in-
terview (N = 14,738, 88.6% response rate), thereby main-
taining the integrity and size of the sibling pairs sample.
In addition, a follow-up school administrator interview
was conducted to measure change in school context from
1995 to 1996. The original Add Health cohort was followed
through their transition to adulthood with a Wave III in-
home interview in 2001­2002 when the sample was aged
18­26 years, and 15,197 original respondents from Wave I
werere-interviewedwitha77.4%responserate.Inaddition,
a sample of 1,507 partners of original respondents was also
interviewed, filling quota samples of 500 married, 500 co-
habiting, and 500 dating partners. Wave IV re-interviewed
the original Add Health cohort as they settled into adult-
hood in 2008­2009 when the cohort was aged 24­32 years
(N=15,701)witharesponserateof80.3%.Formoredetails
on the Add Health design see Harris (2010, 2011).
Response rates for the sibling pairs sub-sample have been
higher than for the overall Add Health cohort at each wave
because sibling pairs are easier to locate (i.e., with more
family contacts) and Add Health has placed priority on
maintaining this sample for longitudinal research. Table 2
shows the number of completed in-home interviews for
sibling pairs according to their genetic relatedness and their
response rates across waves. Response rates are based on
individuals in sibling pairs who were interviewed at Wave
I and who were eligible for inclusion in the Wave II, III,
and IV samples. Response rates for the sibling pairs sample
are quite high, especially at Wave II, only 1 year following
Wave I, when 95% of the siblings in the pairs sample were
re-interviewed. Even at Wave IV, almost 15 years after Wave
I, response rates are over 90% for all types of sibling pairs,
93% for both MZ and DZ twin samples.
Phenotype Data
Survey Data
Add Health is a multidisciplinary multidimensional study
that attempted to measure all the domains relevant to the
specific developmental stage of the Add Health cohort at the
time of the interview, with a particular focus on causes and
consequences of health and health behavior. Table 3 shows
the general topical areas covered by the survey instruments
across waves. The Waves I and II questionnaires collected
data relevant to adolescence, including relationships with
parents, siblings and friends, academics and school, ro-
mantic and sexual relationships, mental health, expecta-
tions for the future, and health risk behavior. At Wave III
during the transition to adulthood, survey attention shifted
toward early family formation, post-secondary education,
labor market activity and military service, mentoring,
civic participation, while maintaining the longitudinal in-
tegrity of previous data on family, friends, achievement,
romantic and sexual relationships, physical and men-
tal health, and health behavior. At Wave IV, when the

attention was devoted to career development, family for-

ers of future health risks or conditions. The complete set
of codebooks for all survey components in all waves of
interviews can be found on the Add Health Web site at
www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/codebooks.
Environmental Data
One of the innovations of the Add Health design was its
ability to obtain independent and direct measures of the
social environment of young people. The in-school and
Waves I and II in-home interviews contain unique data
that characterize the family, school, peer, relationship dyad,
neighborhood,community,andstatecontextsinwhichAdd
Health respondents lived. School context data come from
the in-school surveys based on the census of students in
each school, as well as from school administrator question-
naires. Peer network data were obtained in the in-school
questionnaire. Adolescents nominated their five best male
and five best female friends from the school roster (using a
unique identification number). Because nominated school
friends also took the in-school interview, characteristics of
respondents' peer networks can be constructed by linking
friends' data from the in-school questionnaire and con-
structing variables based on friends' actual responses. In
the in-home Wave I and Wave II interviews, respondents
nominated their best friend, as well as their romantic and
sexual partners. If their friend or partner was also a member
of the in-home sample, their data could be linked to con-
structfriendshipandpartnercontexts.Inthe16schoolsthat
were part of the `saturated' sample, all students in the school
werealsointerviewedinthehome.Completefriendshipand
sexual networks could therefore be constructed with these
data.
Respondents' home residences have been geocoded at
each interview wave and contextual data on the neighbor-
hood, community, and state have been merged to all in-
dividual records. More than 8,500 data elements on the
social and physical environment at multiple spatial lev-
els are available across waves, including such information
as race, ethnic, foreign-born, and religious denomination
composition, poverty rates, crime statistics, sexually trans-
mittedinfection(STI)prevalence,divorceandchildsupport
laws, welfare policies, cigarette taxes, and the proximity and
number of parks, sidewalks, recreation centers, fast food
restaurants, alcohol outlets, and other physical and social
characteristics of the environments in which young people
live.
Figure 1 shows the developmental stages and time pe-
riods during which the Add Health cohort was followed
from early adolescence into adulthood, and the types of en-
vironmental data (top panel) and biological data (bottom
panel) that are available across the waves of data collection.
The strength of Add Health, and thus the strength of the
Add Health sibling pairs data, is the multiple levels of data
that allow researchers to examine social, behavioral, envi-
ronmental, biological, and genetic linkages in health and
behavior across the life course from early adolescence into
young adulthood.
Biological Data
The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the biological mea-
sures available across waves. Height and weight have been
measured across waves and used to track the obesity epi-
demic within this cohort. At Wave III, samples of urine
and saliva were collected to test for STIs and human im-
munodeficiency virus, and buccal cell saliva was collected
from the twins and full siblings in the siblings pairs sub-
sample for DNA extraction (see Harris et al., 2006). An
expanded set of biological measures was collected at Wave
IV, including biomarkers of cardiovascular health (blood
pressure, pulse), metabolic processes (waist circumference,
HbA1c, blood glucose, lipids), immune function (EBV),

the focus of the remainder of this article, was collected
from the full sample at Wave IV, including from all sibling
pairs.
Genetic Data
Add Health provides numerous opportunities for genetic
research. During the Wave III (2001­2002) in-home
interview, buccal cell DNA samples were collected
from the twins and full sibs in the sibling pairs sample
(N  2,600) with high compliance rates (83%). These DNA
samples were genotyped for seven widely studied candidate
polymorphisms and the zygosity status of twins confirmed
by the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University
of Colorado Boulder. Additional information and docu-
mentation in `Biomarkers in Wave III of the Add Health
Study' are posted on the Add Health Web site (http://www.
cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/data/guides/biomark.pdf)
and available in Harris et al. (2006).
As twin zygosity status had been based on ratings of
twin resemblance during the Wave I interviews, zygos-
ity status of the twins was again determined at Wave
III using a panel of 11 highly polymorphic, unlinked
short tandem repeat (STR) markers. These markers in-
cluded D1S1679, D2S1384, D3S1766, D4S1627, D6S1277,
D7S1808, D8S1119, D9S301, D13S796, D15S652, and
D20S481 and the sex-determining locus, amelogenin (IBG-
Hvar1, see http://ibgwww.colorado.edu/genotyping lab/).
The criterion used to assign monozygosity to a twin pair
was 100% concordance of all genotypes at all 12 loci. A
total of 34 pairs (9%) were found to have been incorrectly
assigned based on questionnaire information, including 18
pairs for whom zygosity status could not be assigned from
questionnaire information.
At Wave IV (2008­2009), Add Health expanded its saliva
DNA collection to include the entire sample of Add Health
participants (N = 15,701), affording greater statistical
power for genetic analyses, especially gene x environment
interactions, and opportunities for replication. Saliva was
collected using the Oragene collection method (Oragene,
DNAgenotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) and genomic DNA
isolated from the Oragene solutions using ZymoResearch
(Irvine, CA, USA). Consent rates for Wave IV DNA collec-
tion were high; 96% of all sibling pairs consented to provide
saliva for DNA extraction, and there was little variation by
type of genetic relatedness (similar to the consent rate for
all Wave IV respondents, see `Add Health Wave IV Docu-
mentation: Candidate Genes' at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/
projects/addhealth/data/guides/DNA documentation.pdf).
The Wave IV Program Project was budgeted to genotype
10 candidate loci and a panel of short nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) in at least five of the following candidate
genes: the dopamine transporter (DAT1, locus symbol
SLC6A3); dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4); dopamine D2
receptor (DRD2); serotonin transporter (5HTT, locus
symbol SLC6A4); serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A);
Monoamine Oxidase A promoter (MAOA-uVNTR);
Monoamine Oxidase A STR (MAOA[GT]n); dopamine D5

Research Using the Genetic Pairs in Add
Health
Genetic research in Add Health has been published in a wide
range of social and biomedical science journals on topics
such as substance use and dependence (e.g., Daw et al.,
in press; Zeiger et al., 2008), depression (e.g., Fuemmeler
et al., 2009), sexual behavior (e.g., Ge et al., 2007; Halpern
et al., 2007; McHale et al., 2009), political participation
(e.g., Dawes & Fowler, 2009), subjective well being (e.g., De
Neve, 2011), body mass index and obesity (e.g., Haberstick
et al., 2010; North et al., 2010), crime and delinquency (e.g.,
Guo et al., 2008), education (e.g., Nielsen, 2006; Shanahan
et al., 2007), suicide (e.g., Cho et al., 2006), aggression (e.g.,
Hart & Marmorstein, 2009), friend selection (e.g., Board-
man et al., 2012; Guo, 2006), attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (e.g., Haberstick et al., 2008), conduct disorder and
self-control (e.g., Schulz-Heik et al., 2010), family and peer
relations (e.g., Cruz et al., 2012; Harden et al., 2008), and
methodology (e.g., Medland & Neale, 2010). More than
half of these publications examine the ways in which the
environment interacts with genetic markers to affect health
and behavior outcomes. Below we describe in more de-
tail some illustrative examples of genetic research in Add
Health.
Guo et al. (2010) examined how the dopamine trans-
porter gene (DAT1) interacts with age (or life course stage)
in relation to risk behavior (including delinquency, number
of sex partners, substance use, and seatbelt use) from ado-
lescence into young adulthood, using data on the siblings
pairs from Waves I, II, and III of Add Health. They reported
a protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype in the VNTR
of DAT1 on risky behavior; individuals with DAT19R/9R
compared to DAT1Any10R, reported lower levels of risky
behaviors. However, this protective effect varied according
to age/life course stage, such that genetic protection is evi-
dent when the risk behavior is illegal (e.g., alcohol use and
smoking in adolescence), but vanishes when the behaviors
are legal or more socially tolerated (e.g., alcohol use and
smoking in adulthood). This research is important because
it demonstrates how legal, as well as social, contexts can
enhance or diminish genetic associations with a spectrum
of risky behaviors.
Boardman et al. (2008) exploited the design of Add
Health to investigate peer and school environment interac-
tionswithgeneticfactorsassociatedwithsmokingcigarettes
among adolescents. In the Add Health in-school survey, re-
spondents nominated up to 10 of their friends who were
also in-school survey participants. Adolescents receiving
the most friendship nominations can be classified the `most
popular' students who shape smoking norms for the larger
school community because of their social status and so-
cial connections. Boardman and colleagues assessed the
smoking behavior of the most popular students and found
that school norms favoring smoking (i.e., prevalence of
daily smoking among the most popular students) enhanced
the associations between genetic factors and daily smoking
among all students. Thus, genetic contributions may not
emerge unless the environment actively engages individu-
als in behaviors and reinforces these behaviors. Because the
relative contribution of genetics to the daily use of cigarettes
is conditional upon school norms related to cigarette use,
there are policy opportunities to influence these norms to
curb smoking behavior during the critical stage of adoles-
cence, when initiation of smoking can set trajectories for
continued use into adulthood.
Shanahan et al. (2008) examined whether the DRD2
Taq1A single nucleotide polymorphism is related to school
continuation and whether social relationships compensate
the DRD2 genetic risk. How much parents and their chil-
dren talk about school projects, related issues, and grades
captured the student­parent relationship and parental in-
volvement in their school at Wave I (1995). School attain-
ment was measured at Wave III (2001­2002) when Add
Health participants in the sibling pairs sample were be-
tween the ages of 18 and 24 among Black and White males
and females. Tests of the gene-environment interplay in
this study revealed that two measures of parental involve-
ment and the quality of school mitigated the risk of not
continuing their schooling among carriers of the DRD2
Taq1A allele. These factors included a high parental socio-
economic status, high parental involvement in school, and
having attended a school where a large number of stu-
dents go on to attend college. These findings underscore
the salience of the student--parent relationship in enhanc-
ing the likelihood of continuing education beyond high
school.

project investigators had no proprietary period for analysis
prior to data release -- the scientific community was given
access to the data at the same time as project investigators;
(2) established a data security plan at the time of proposal
submission to the National Institutes of Health; and (3)
developed data sharing guidelines, policies, and procedures
before the data were ready for dissemination. Add Health
data sets have been distributed to researchers around the
world since the release of Wave I data in 1997 and cur-
rently there are over 10,000 Add Health researchers using
the released data.
Add Health releases all survey data across all waves of in-
terview, and releases assay and test results on biospecimens,
including STI test results, biomarkers, and the genotype
data described above. Due to the sensitive and confiden-
tial content, Add Health data sets are distributed according
to a tiered data disclosure plan designed to protect the data
from the risk of direct and indirect disclosure of respondent
identity. The tiered data disclosure plan consists of four ver-
sions of Add Health data that differ in the amount of detail
in confidential information included. Restricted data con-
tracts require users to take comprehensive precautions to
protect the data from non-authorized use and agreeing to
use the data solely for statistical reporting and analysis. Data
from all waves of the Add Health study are disseminated by
the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Re-
search as a part of their Data Sharing for Demographic Re-
search (DSDR) project. The DSDR Add Health Web page
contains the Add Health study description, publications
list, documentation files, and data sets for analysis: http://
www.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/DSDR/STUDY/21600.xml.
Researchers interested in obtaining archived biospeci-
men samples from Add Health, including urine, blood
spots, and saliva DNA, to conduct additional biospecimen
analysismustsubmitanAncillaryStudyproposaltotheAdd
Health Principal Investigator for internal and external re-
view. A decision to release archived samples is based on the
scientificmeritoftheproposedproject,contributiontoAdd
Health, and quantity of specimen requested. Researchers
planning a grant submission to fund Add Health specimen
analysis must include documentation of Add Health ap-
proval of specimen use in their grant application, and must
cover all costs associated with the provision of supplemental
data to Add Health. In addition, the investigator must agree
to the Add Health dissemination policy of no proprietary
period for analysis of new data produced and paid for by
the investigator.
In summary, Add Health provides unique longitu-
dinal data capturing biological, psychosocial, and envi-
ronmental data for nationally representative samples of
sibling pairs that have been followed from early ado-
lescence into adulthood. These data sets, and the abil-
ity to expand their coverage with ancillary studies, of-
fer unprecedented opportunities for multi-level genetic
research.
