Background. Numerous methods have been used to evaluate medication management quality in older adults; however,
their predictive validities are unknown. Major medication quality indicators include polypharmacy, drug­drug inter-
actions, and inappropriate medication use. To date, no study has attempted to evaluate the three approaches systematically
or the effect of each approach on mortality in a Hispanic population. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship
between polypharmacy, drug­drug interactions, and inappropriate medication use on the mortality of a community-based
population of Mexican American older adults.
Methods. We used a life table survival analysis of a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of 3050 older
Mexican Americans of whom 1823 were taking prescription and over-the-counter medications.
Results. After adjustment for relevant covariates, use of more than four different medications (polypharmacy) was
independently associated with mortality. The presence of major drug interactions and the use of inappropriate medications
were not significantly associated with mortality in our study sample.
Conclusion. Polypharmacy (.4 medications) is significantly associated with mortality in Mexican American older adults.
This community-basedstudy isthe firsttodemonstrate adirectassociation betweenpolypharmacyandmortality inthispopulation.
MEDICATION management represents one of the most
important health care issues for older adults in the
United States. Recently, medication management was identi-
fied as a ``priority area for national action'' by the Institute
of Medicine (1). Medication-related errors are common and
are estimated to account for more than 7000 deaths annually
(2,3). In 1994, adverse drug reactions were the sixth leading
cause of death in hospitalized patients (4). In the outpatient
setting, 25% of patients reported having an adverse drug
event, of which 13% were considered serious (5). In the year
2000, it was estimated that costs due to medication-related
problems exceeded $177 billion (6). Because adults aged
65 years and older consume more than 30% of prescription
medications (7), suboptimal medication management is a
major patient safety concern in older adults.
Although a number of methods have been used to evalu-
ate medication management quality in older adults, their
predictive validities are unknown. Also, there is no agree-
ment on a standard definition for the use of medications that
leads to unintended harm. Suboptimal medication manage-
ment has been defined as overuse, underuse, erratic use, or
contraindicated use of a prescribed or nonprescribed medi-
cation (8). Other terms commonly used are adverse drug
events, drug-related problems, and adverse drug reactions.
Medication outcomes most commonly studied in older adult
populations are those related to polypharmacy, drug­drug
interactions, and the use of inappropriate drugs. Therefore,
we use the term suboptimal medication use as defined by any
one of the following: (i) polypharmacy--use of more than
four medications, (ii) drug­drug interactions--presence of any
drug­drug interaction, or (iii) the presence of inappropri-
ate medication use as defined by the Beer's criteria (9).
Potential causes of poor outcomes due to medications are
numerous. Polypharmacy has been associated with a higher
risk of adverse events, poor patient compliance, higher health
care costs, and increased hospitalizations (1,10,11). Use of
more than a single medication also carries the potential of
drug­drug interactions. Drug­drug interactions are common
among older ambulatory adults, and more than 100,000
different drug­drug interactions have been identified as
potentially serious (12). Additionally, geriatric care experts
have developed an ``inappropriate'' medication list consisting
of medications considered unsuitable for older adult patients
due to the high risk of unintended harm (9,13). The prevalence
of inappropriate medication use in older adults has been
estimated to be as high as 40% (11). Each of these indicators
illustrates potential suboptimal medication management.
Studies have approached quality indicators for sub-
optimal medication management in various ways including
inappropriate medication use and potential drug­drug
interactions. Each approach has individually been shown
to be a significant factor in determining adverse outcomes
from medication use. To date, no study has attempted to
evaluate the effect of each quality indicator on mortality in

a community-based older adult population. This article
describes the impact of polypharmacy, drug-drug interac-
tions, and inappropriate medication use on the mortality of
a selected population of community-based Mexican Amer-
ican older adults living in the southwestern United States.
METHODS
Participants
The Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic
Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) is an ongoing longitudinal
study of Mexican American older adults between the ages
of 65 and 99. The study design and sampling have been
described previously (14). In brief, the sample was drawn
using area probability sampling procedures to represent the
Mexican American older adult population residing in Texas,
New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California. In 1993, the
study team completed in-home contacts with the participants
that included medication information. There were 3050
participants interviewed and evaluated in their own homes by
trained interviewers. Follow-up in-home evaluations were
done approximately 2 years apart with the most recent contact
being approximately 8 years after the original contact. Of the
3050 baseline interviewees, 1823 reported using medication
and 1227 did not. Eight-year mortality data were used in the
present study. There were 940 deaths (30.8%) since baseline.
For deceased persons, a brief proxy interview was obtained
that included information on the time and place of death,
causes of death, and any hospitalizations or nursing home
admissions. Validation of death was confirmed by a National
Death Index search. Research protocol was approved by the
UTHSCSA and UTMB institutional review boards, and all
participants gave informed oral consent.
Medication Definitions
We define suboptimal medication use as any of the
following:
Polypharmacy.--Polypharmacy is defined as the use of
more than four medications. This number was chosen for
clarity of presentation and to be consistent with prior
definitions of polypharmacy (15­18). The total number of
prescription and over-the-counter medications taken by each
participant were counted, and participants were categorized
into groups taking 1, 2, 3, 4, or .4 medications. Combi-
nation products were counted as more than one medication
by the total number of active ingredients.
Drug­drug interactions.--Potential adverse drug­drug
interactions were determined for each participant by use
of the Micromedex Intranet Knowledge Base System (19).
This system was selected because it is comprehensive,
widely available, and interactive. The Micromedex system,
part of the mobile Physicians Desk Reference, is designed
to assist the clinician in interpreting interaction data. The
Micromedex system used an expert panel to identify drug
interactions and classify them into three groups. Each
participant's medications were entered from the Hispanic
EPESE database into the Micromedex system: Drug interac-
tions were then categorized into major, moderate, or minor
drug­drug interactions by using the following criteria devel-
oped by the Micromedex system: (i) Major: The adverse
interaction may be any interaction that is contraindicated,
life-threatening, and/or requires medical intervention to
minimize or prevent serious adverse effects. Examples in-
clude the use of erythromycin with amiodarone or metopro-
lol with verapamil. (ii) Moderate: The interaction may result
in an exacerbation of the patient's condition and/or require
an alteration in therapy. (iii) Minor: The interaction would
have limited clinical effects. Manifestations may include
an increase in the frequency or severity of side effects but
generally would not require a major alteration in therapy.
``Inappropriate'' medication use.--Each participant's
medication list was evaluated for use of ``inappropriate''
medications by using the Beer's criteria for inappropriate
medication use (9), and participants were classified into
those using inappropriate medications and those not using
inappropriate medications. Beer's criteria include a list of
medications considered inappropriate by an expert panel
because they are either ineffective or present unnecessary
high risk. Examples include the use of carisoprodol, chlor-
propamide, ticlopidine, and flurazepam.
Other Variables
Age-adjusted mortality.--Mortality was evaluated at follow-
up visits every 2 years for a total of 8 years, and was validated
by using the National Death Index. Mortality rates for those
participants who met criteria for suboptimal medication use,
compared to those who did not, were age-adjusted using the
direct method of adjustment. The 1990 U.S. Census data,
as the Census time closest to the EPESE medication data
collection, was used as the standard population for age dis-
tribution of Mexican Americans age 65 years or older.
Sociodemographic variables.--Sociodemographic variables
collected included age, gender, date of birth, current household
income, current employment status, and acculturation. Accul-
turation was measured using Hazuda's algorithm (20).
Illness severity.--Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
(IADL) and self-reported health status were used to estimate
illness severity. IADLs were assessed using the modified
Older American Resource Scale (OARS) (21). For self-
reported health status, participants were asked to rate their
current health status as excellent, good, fair, or poor.
Disease states.--We assessed the presence of chronic
illnesses with a self-reported condition checklist used pre-
viously in the EPESE studies. The major disease states listed
were those defined by the National Center for Health
Statistics as the leading causes of death in the United States
(22). In order, these are: cardiovascular disease, neoplasms,
cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and diabetes mellitus. Hypertension was also in-
cluded due to its major impact on morbidity and medication
use in the Mexican American population. We exam-
ined each disease separately, as individual diseases have
differential impact on medication use and on mortality.
171
SUBOPTIMAL MEDICATION USE AND MORTALITY IN OLDER ADULTS
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was not included in
the EPESE baseline evaluation and was therefore excluded
from the analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Life table survival estimates were obtained using SAS
software (23). The survival function S(t) was calculated as
S(t) ¼ 1 À f(t), where f(t) indicates the death rate as a func-
tion of time. Homogeneity of the estimated survival curves
between the various medication usage groups were tested
using the Wilcoxon signed rank and log-rank test statistics
(24). These statistics test the null hypothesis that the rates of
decline in each group are not statistically different. Survival
distribution plots were drawn for visual inspection. In addi-
tion, Cox proportional hazards regression models (25) were
used to control for gender, age, educational level, illness
severity, and six chronic comorbid disease states.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
The demographic characteristics (Table 1) show that
40.2% (n ¼ 1227) of participants used no medications.
Those participants who used medications were more likely
to be female, have poor self-reported health, have ADL
limitations, and suffer differentially from the five chronic
diseases examined.
Unadjusted Survival Models
The unadjusted proportional hazards models for drug­drug
interactions, polypharmacy, and inappropriate medication
use are shown in Table 2. Participants who had the potential
of major drug­drug interactions relative to those with no
interactions had significantly poorer survival (43% increased
mortality risk). Also, those participants with a moderate drug
interaction potential had a marginally significant poorer
survival. Participants who used more than four medications
relative to those using one medication showed a 54%
decreased survival rate. Inappropriate medication use was
not significantly associated with increased mortality risk.
Drug­Drug Interactions
Figure 1A depicts survival by medication interaction
group. Significant differences in mortality were found over
time in those participants who had the potential for a major
drug­drug interaction only (p , .05).
Table 3 shows the results of the adjusted and unadjusted
proportional hazards model where a dichotomous drug
interaction variable (major or moderate ¼ 1; other ¼ 0) was
used to predict mortality. Relative to those with no drug
interactions, those participants with a major or moderate
drug interaction demonstrated a 27% increase in mortality
risk (Model 1 in top part of Table 3). After adjusting for age
and gender (Model 2), the increased risk remained signif-
icant. However, after adjustment for comorbid disease
(Model 3) and functional status (Model 4), the increased risk
for participants with a major or moderate drug interaction
was no longer significant. This finding indicates that the
association between drug interaction and mortality is ex-
plained by the significant comorbid factors.
Polypharmacy
Figure 1B depicts survival in the cohort by five poly-
pharmacy groups (use of 1, 2, 3, 4, or .4 medications).
Those participants taking more than four medications had
significantly higher mortality rates (p , .0002).
Table 3 also shows the adjusted and unadjusted pro-
portional hazards model in which a dichotomous poly-
pharmacy variable is used as a predictor of mortality (.4
drugs vs 4 drugs). In the unadjusted model (Model 1), the
risk of mortality was increased by 51% among those taking

more than four medications compared to those taking four or
fewer. After adjustment for demographics, comorbid illness,
and functional limitations (Models 2­4), the risk of mor-
tality associated with polypharmacy decreased to 27% but
remained statistically significant.
The interaction between time and the aforementioned
suboptimal medication use was not statistically significant
(p ¼ .40), demonstrating that the assumptions of pro-
portional hazards were not violated.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the
relationship of polypharmacy, drug­drug interactions, and
inappropriate medication use with mortality in a community-
based cohort of Hispanic older adults in the United States.
Polypharmacy was a predictor of mortality, independent of
age, socioeconomic status, or chronic disease status and/or
severity. It has been thought that polypharmacy is potentially
harmful because, in large part, it increases the probability of
adverse drug­drug interactions (26,27). Our results do not
appear to support this conclusion because polypharmacy
alone (not potential adverse drug­drug interactions) was
associated with mortality. It has been reported that adverse
drug events seem to be most commonly due to failure in
proper dosing (28). Rather than a direct toxicity due to
adverse drug­drug interactions, polypharmacy might have
a direct effect through the cumulative effects of multiple
medications on the renal or hepatic systems of older adults,
and cause the initiation of a ``cascade of interactions'' in these
older adults, who already suffer from multiple comorbidities
(29). Alternatively, polypharmacy increases the odds that the
addition of any single medication to a frail older adult's
regimen will cause a potentially adverse reaction in that
individual patient. Our results are of particular importance
given the mounting pressure for ``recommended'' polyphar-
macy--that is, current disease-specific treatment guidelines
that are uniformly being recommended as indications of
``quality'' care. The preponderance of evidence supporting
guidelines was primarily developed in younger participant
populations without multiple comorbidities. Whether the risk
of ``recommended polypharmacy'' outweighs the benefit is
not known. This study helps to provide some understanding
about the potential risk of polypharmacy. Finally, the
polypharmacy rate in Mexican Americans may be lower
than that expected for non-Hispanic whites because Mexican
Americans use fewer over-the-counter medications (7).
Potential ``inappropriate'' medication use did not appear to
have a mortality effect. Beer's criteria clearly state that many
of the medications that fit the criteria for inappropriateness
may, in fact, be indicated in certain situations. Higashi and
colleagues (30) found that, among an ambulatory older adult
population, pharmacologic management problems other than
inappropriate medication prescribing were more common
and potentially more important. Our results would seem to
support the argument that medication monitoring, documen-
tation, and continuity may be more important parameters to
monitor in older populations than reduction of inappropriate
medication use alone would be. More research is clearly
needed to more fully delineate these issues.
Interestingly, potential major or moderate drug­drug
interactions did not independently predict mortality in our
participant population. Perhaps significant drug­drug inter-
actions increase morbidity and subsequent detection leading
to discontinuation of the offending medications before the
drug combinations become lethal. An alternative explanation
may be that the potential for a drug­drug interaction does

not equal an actual interaction, and actual events may not
occur frequently enough to establish a relationship between
potential drug­drug interaction and mortality. Further study
is needed to better understand the role of adverse drug­drug
interactions in morbidity and mortality of older adults.
It is also possible that increasing comorbidity and/or
disease severity leads to polypharmacy and adverse drug
interactions and that the primary mortality risk might be
the severity of illness and not polypharmacy or increased
medication use. However, polypharmacy remained a signif-
icant independent predictor of mortality even when ADL
dependency and poor self-reported health, standard proxies
for illness severity, were added to our model. A limitation of
this study is the self-reported nature of the interviews. We
did not determine medication compliance. Furthermore, it is
possible that Mexican American elders might be differen-
tially predisposed to polypharmacy-related mortality when
compared to the general population, but this predisposition
would have to be an effect exclusive of demographic fac-
tors. We have previously found that Mexican American
older adults taking inappropriate medications tended to fit
the criteria for high vulnerability: unmarried, high physician
utilization, depressed, and Medicare/Medicaid recipients
(31). Another limitation was that underutilization was not
examined, which may in itself be an independent predictor
of mortality. Finally, although the Micromedex system is a
widely used drug­drug interaction clinical tool, to our knowl-
edge, it has not been tested for the validity or reliability of
the drug­drug interaction information provided.
Despite these limitations, polypharmacy was the key
suboptimal medication independent predictor for mortality
in the cohort of Mexican American older adults studied. Our
results indicate that increasing the number of medications
alone may pose a long-term mortality risk, at least in the
older Mexican American population. Further research is
needed to confirm our findings.
