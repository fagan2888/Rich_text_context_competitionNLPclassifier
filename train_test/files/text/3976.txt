Introduction
Do upper houses matter for cabinet formation? If so, does it
make a difference how powerful they are? Constitutional
designers of parliamentary systems would profit from robust
scientific answers to these questions. Some might embrace
upper houses in the hope of generating more diverse and
inclusive cabinets, thus fostering the `consensual' character
of democracy (Lijphart, 2012). Others might try to avoid
any effect of upper houses on cabinet formation, so that
lower house elections could be organized as choices between
clearly identifiable cabinet alternatives (Powell, 2000).
Whichever normative view one prefers, the practical conse-
quences of parliamentary design depend on empirical facts.
The most sophisticated study to give clear answers to
our questions is still that of Druckman, Martin and Thies
(2005) (hereafter DMT): the study argues that, yes, upper
houses matter for cabinet formation, and no, how powerful
they are does not make a difference. DMT use conditional
logit models to study cabinet formation in eight democra-
cies. They conclude, first, that cabinet alternatives that
control upper house majorities are more likely to form than
those that do not, everything else being equal. Second, they
argue that this is true regardless of how constitutionally
powerful upper houses are. Given the practical importance
of these two conclusions, it is useful to ask how theoreti-
cally plausible and empirically robust they are.
In this note we question DMT's findings. First, we argue
that the combination of answers proposed is theoretically
implausible (section 2). If rational coalition-builders make
special efforts to gain upper house majorities, despite the sig-
nificant costs of doing so, they can also be expected to care-
fully consider the constitutional powers of these chambers.
Second, we argue that DMT's data does not support their
conclusions (section 3). The results are driven exclusively by

Abstract
Do upper houses matter for cabinet formation? If so, does it make a difference how powerful they are? The most
sophisticated study to give clear answers to these questions is still that of Druckman, Martin and Thies (2005), which
argues that upper houses influence cabinet formation, regardless of their formal powers. We dispute these answers
theoretically and empirically. Since adjusting cabinet formation to second chamber composition is not necessary and
can be costly, we should expect that if upper houses matter at all, their formal powers should matter too. Replication
shows that the empirical results are driven exclusively by two countries with weak upper houses, one of which (Ireland)
is miscoded. If this case is recoded there is no statistically or substantially significant effect of upper houses, regardless of
their power. We conclude that the two questions cannot yet be answered: we need more research based on broader
samples in order to assess whether upper houses matter for cabinet formation and whether their formal powers make
a difference.

the two cases with weak upper houses, one of which (Ireland)
is coded misleadingly. If this case is recoded, there is no sta-
tistically or substantially significant effect of upper houses.
We conclude that further research should apply DMT's pio-
neering empirical approach to broader samples (section 4).
Theory
DMT rightly criticize many coalition-formation theories
for assuming parliaments to be `little more than loyal rub-
ber stamps of government initiatives' (p. 334). While this
assumption is reasonable in many contexts, it becomes
problematic for minority cabinets and bicameralism. For
the latter case, DMT argue that if upper houses can affect
the success of government policies, and possibly induce
their early termination, then coalition-builders have an
incentive to build coalitions that control a majority in the
upper house. DMT thus hypothesize that `of all the poten-
tial governments that might arise in a given formation epi-
sode, those with upper-house majorities are more likely to
form, everything else being equal' (p. 535). Moreover, they
suggest that this is true even if an upper house has only
weak legislative powers (p. 534).
The problem with this reasoning is that it neglects the
costs of achieving majorities in upper chambers. These
costs come mainly in the forms of a higher number of cabi-
net parties, greater ideological divisions or oversized cabi-
net status. If we consider these costs theoretically, we see
that they can provide coalition-builders with strong incen-
tives not to control a second chamber majority. As we know
from the literature on minority cabinets, cabinets do not
necessarily need a fixed legislative majority to secure the
passage of their programme. Indeed, avoiding a fixed
majority can have significant advantages, such as the free-
dom to form different coalitions on different issues, which
may greatly reduce the costs of coalition-building (Tsebelis,
2002: 111­114). Moreover, if the policy space is essentially
unidimensional, it would be sufficient to include the upper
house median into the cabinet rather than seeking upper
house majority status (Eppner, 2014).
Considering the costs of upper chamber majorities is
important, because rational coalition-builders that seek a
balance between costs and benefits will be very attentive to
the formal powers of upper houses. The more powerful a
house, the greater should be the incentive to secure majori-
ties within it (either by fixing this majority or by controlling
the median). DMT (p. 541) note research that shows how
even formally weak upper houses can influence legislation
under certain conditions (e.g. Tsebelis and Money, 1997).
This is true as far as it goes, but accepting that weak upper
houses have the potential for some influence some of the
time is very different from assuming that they have the
same average causal effect as strong upper houses. Indeed,
most of the empirically successful literature on the legisla-
tive effects of institutional `veto players' makes sharp
distinctions based on formal powers (Tsebelis, 2002). If
formal powers matter for the explanation of the legislative
effects of second chambers, however, it would be paradoxi-
cal if they did not matter for the explanation of cabinet
formation.
We believe that there is no paradox. Most of the qualita-
tive evidence on the effects of upper houses on cabinet
formation does focus on powerful veto players ­ as do
DMT themselves with their illustrative example of Japan
(pp. 531­532). And, as we show next, there is no robust
evidence in DMT's study for any causal effect of upper
houses. The study has not shown that the constitutional
powers of upper houses do not matter.
Replication
DMT use the dataset by Martin and Stevenson (2001), but
focus only on the 8 of 14 countries with upper chambers (p.
535). This is a small basis for drawing general conclusions,
but we stick to the sample for the sake of comparable
results.
DMT distinguish between countries with symmetric and
asymmetric bicameralism (Lijphart, 2012). Symmetric
bicameralism means that the upper house has absolute veto
power (on all or most important legislation) and sufficient
democratic legitimacy to use it. If the upper house pos-
sesses only suspensory veto power or lacks democratic
legitimacy, or both, bicameralism is asymmetric. Two
bicameral systems in the sample were asymmetric (Ireland
[1973­86] and Austria [1949­82]) and six were symmetric
(Belgium [1946­85], Denmark [1949­53], Germany
[1949­87], Italy [1949­87], the Netherlands [1948­86] and
Sweden [1945­70]).
DMT also follow Martin and Stevenson in excluding all
situations in which single parties won a majority (p. 544,
n. 9).1 DMT repeat the conditional logit analysis of Martin
and Stevenson for the reduced sample and add a dummy
variable for `Upper-Chamber Majority'.2 We were able to
replicate the results of their conditional logit analysis
(DMT's model 4),3 given in column (2) of Table 1.4 The
statistically significant coefficient of 1.11 implies an odds
ratio of 3.03, which means that majority status in the upper
house triples the chances for a potential government to
form.
To test for the relevance of upper house powers, DMT
also interact the majority status variable with an indicator
for whether or not the upper chamber has constitutionally
granted veto power. They do not present the results, but
report that they did not find any evidence for an interaction
effect. They conclude that `upper chambers matter for gov-
ernment coalition builders, even if they are possessed of
few formal powers' (p. 542).
DMT's interaction model is shown in column (1) of
Table 1 (model 1). Before we comment on the upper house
majority variable, note that several variables capture the
Eppner and Ganghof 3
costs of building inclusive cabinets and that the results are
in line with our theoretical reasoning. Increasing the num-
ber of cabinet parties and increasing the ideological
differences within the cabinet both reduce the likelihood
that a proto-coalition actually forms, everything else being
equal. The estimated negative effect of oversized coalitions

also underlines the costs of inclusiveness, but it is not sta-
tistically significant. This evidence is in line with rationalist
theories.
In contrast, DMT's findings on the impact of upper
houses seem to contradict these theories. In model 1 the
variable `upper house majority' is interacted with a dummy
that is 0 for all upper houses with absolute veto power, and
1 for those without.5 The results imply that symmetric upper
houses have no influence on government formation. The
overall estimated effect of upper houses estimated by the
authors is driven exclusively by the (two) weak upper houses
of Austria and Ireland.6 To show this more clearly, we esti-
mate DMT's main `model 4' (Table 1, column (2)) only for
the six countries with symmetric upper houses (column (3)).
We see that the coefficient is almost cut in half and not sta-
tistically significant. As argued above, if these results were
robust, they would contradict rationalist theories. Rational
coalition-builders should be more, rather than less, willing
to take upper houses into account, despite the potential costs
of doing so, when these houses are powerful.
Closer inspection of the data shows, however, that the
results are not robust. Instead, the evidence suggests that
upper houses do not matter at all, at least in DMT's sample.
The reason is that the Irish case adds only four government
formations to the analysis (1981, two in 1982, 1987), and
removing those four is sufficient for the coefficient to
become insignificant (column 4). This fact is highly prob-
lematic for two reasons. First, the idea that the Irish upper
house (Seanad) affects cabinet formation is not corrobo-
rated by in-depth case evidence (Coakley and Laver, 1997;
Gallagher, 2010; Manning, 2010).7 The composition of the
Irish Senate is not only similar to that of the first chamber,
but a newly elected prime minister has the right to nominate
11 out of the 60 upper house members to ensure a govern-
ment majority in the second chamber. Hence, `rather than
the Seanad having any impact on the composition of the
government, it is currently the government ... that has an
impact on the composition of the Seanad' (Coakley and
Laver, 1997: 61). Second, DMT's coding of this case
distorts this procedural reality. For each Irish formation
opportunity, they code the Senate composition after the
new prime minister's nominations have taken place. It is
thus hardly surprising that all actually formed governments
held upper chamber majorities, while few alternative proto-
coalitions could count on majorities in the Senate.
Column 5 shows DMT's `model 4' with more adequate
coding. We gathered data on upper house composition and
assigned each Irish proto-coalition its potential upper house
status (should it form a government and be able to nominate
members in the newly elected Senate). Simply re-coding
the four Irish cabinet formations in this way is sufficient for
the coefficient to be substantially reduced and lose statisti-
cal significance, even if all eight countries are included in
the analysis (compare columns (2) and (5)).
Conclusion
In sum, DMT provide no convincing evidence that upper
houses affect government formation. On the basis of their
sample, we would have to conclude that neither symmetric
nor asymmetric bicameralism affects cabinet formation. It
would clearly be premature to draw firm conclusions, how-
ever, as their analysis includes only eight bicameral sys-
tems. Other studies which cover larger sets of countries and
focus exclusively on symmetric bicameralism do report evi-
dence that upper houses affect cabinet formation (Ganghof,
2010; Volden and Carrubba, 2004), yet these studies do not
use conditional or mixed logit models. The literature simply
lacks robust answers to questions of whether upper houses
affect cabinet formation and how their formal powers and
democratic legitimacy mediate the relationship.
Future research should follow in DMT's footsteps and
apply conditional or mixed logit models to larger and more
diverse samples. Our theoretical expectation is that if upper
houses do matter for cabinet formation ­ and it is not theo-
retically obvious that they do ­ their formal powers (and
democratic legitimacy) must also matter, because rational
coalition-builders care about the costs of inclusiveness.
This reasoning also implies the possibility that coalition-
builders might content themselves with controlling the
upper house median rather than an upper house majority.
These different theoretical possibilities can only be arbi-
trated empirically. Despite DMT's pioneering effort, much
work remains to be done before we might be able to pro-
vide constitutional designers with reliable conclusions.

This research received no specific grant from any funding agency
in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
Notes
1. This is somewhat surprising, as in DMT's main qualitative
example to motivate their main hypothesis ­ a cabinet for-
mation in Japan ­ a single party controlled a majority in the
lower house (pp. 531­2).
2. Furthermore, they add a variable for `Lower-Chamber Seat
Share', which is interacted with the minority status of the
coalition (p. 538).
3. There is some debate about the adequacy of the conditional
logit model (Glasgow et al., 2012). Indeed, if we estimate a
mixed logit model using DMT's data set, there is no signifi-
cant effect of second chambers even ignoring the problems
we discuss in this note.
4. We downloaded the replication files from the authors'websites.
5. DMT also estimate an additional interaction model that
uses a slightly different indicator for the strengths of
upper houses. The alternative indicator treats the Dutch
Eppner and Ganghof 5
upper house as asymmetric because it cannot propose or
amend legislation. The results of this analysis do not differ
substantially.
6. The coefficient for coalitions controlling a majority in asym-
metric upper chambers is positive and significant (2.75,
z=2.58).
7. The same is true for Austria (Müller, 2000).
