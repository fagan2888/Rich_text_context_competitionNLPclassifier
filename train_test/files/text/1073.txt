Abstract:
In previous research, Rohli et al. (2005) identified long-term features of the northern hemispheric circumpolar vortex
(NHCPV) in January. This research provides a seasonal analysis using December and February to augment the previously
analyzed January data in representing winter, along with April, July, and October data to represent spring, summer, and
autumn, respectively. A representative 500 hPa geopotential height contour was selected to delineate the NHCPV in each
of the five months. The area, shape, and centroid of the monthly December, February, April, July, and October NHCPV
are computed for 1959­2001 to supplement the previously identified January properties. These geometrical features of
the NHCPV reveal relationships between hemispheric-scale circulation and temperature anomalies throughout the year. A
circularity ratio (Rohli et al., 2005) is used to characterize the shape of the hemispheric-scale circulation. Results suggest
that only October exhibit long-term trends in either area or circularity, with July being the most variable month in area
and October being the most variable month in circularity. Centroids tend to be skewed toward the Pacific basin, except in
spring, but few systematic temporal shifts in centroid position were noted for any month. The NHCPV is correlated with
atmospheric teleconnection patterns in several months. For example, as was the case for January (Rohli et al., 2005), the
Arctic Oscillation (AO) is associated with the area of the December, February, and April NHCPV, while in December the
circularity is positively correlated to the AO Index. Also, the Pacific-North American index is correlated with the area of
the December and February NHCPV and with the shape of the December and October NHCPV. Copyright  2006 Royal

INTRODUCTION
Variation in the hemispheric-scale, upper-level, prevail-
ing atmospheric circulation results from variations in the
input of energy across the earth's surface. One indi-
cator of this prevailing circulation is the circumpolar
vortex (CPV), a cyclonic circulation in the middle- to
upper-troposphere circumnavigating the poles in each
hemisphere. Because the CPV exists over the region of
strongest thermal gradients, variation in area, shape, and
position of the CPV characterizes the impacts of tem-
perature changes on circulation. Furthermore, the CPV
also may explain variation in other circulation-dependent
atmospheric features, such as humidity, precipitation, and
pollution advection.
Rohli et al. (2005) suggested that in Januaries from
1959 to 2001, the Northern Hemisphere's CPV (NHCPV)
exhibited no linear temporal trends in area or shape, and
that the mean centroid of the NHCPV is displaced from
the North Pole in the direction of the Pacific Ocean. Fur-
thermore, Rohli et al. (2005) linked the Arctic Oscillation
(AO) to variability in the area of the January NHCPV,
and the Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection to

the shape (but not area) of the January NHCPV over the
same period.
This research expands on previous research by exam-
ining variability and changes in the area, shape, and
position of the NHCPV, and linkages to atmospheric
teleconnections, throughout the year. Because the win-
ter season is the time of strongest pressure gradients, and
therefore, the most meaningful and identifiable NHCPV,
December and February analyzes were added to corrob-
orate the previous exploratory January results. Because
of the labor-intensive nature of representing the NHCPV
and calculating geometric features of it, April, July, and
October were selected to represent the spring, summer,
and autumn, respectively.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this research is to provide a more com-
plete history and better understanding of the NHCPV and
atmospheric circulation. The most fundamental question
addressed in both this research and in Rohli et al. (2005)
is whether the NHCPV exhibits long-term trends in geo-
metrical and spatial features over the 1959­2001 period.
Therefore, this research includes several objectives to
characterize the change in the NHCPV including:

· examining the long-term variability and changes in the
area,
· characterizing the temporal variability and changes in
circularity,
· determining whether the mean geographic position has
changed over time, and
· identifying correlations between the area and circular-
ity of the hemispheric-scale flow (represented by the
CPV) and sub-hemispheric-scale circulation features
(represented by atmospheric teleconnections).
First, it is important to document the change in area
of the NHCPV. The size of the CPV serves as a proxy
for the overall degree of equatorward displacement of
polar air and the polar front jet stream at its leading
edge. However, even if the NHCPV shows similar
area over time, it may force differing impacts. For
example, the NHCPV in two months may have the
same area, but in one of the months, the flow could
be characterized by intense ridges and troughs that give
the NHCPV an meridional shape, while the other month
could be characterized by a circular shape about the North
Pole (and therefore zonal, or westerly, upper-level flow
throughout the midlatitudes). Therefore it is important
to examine changes in the circularity, or shape, of the
NHCPV as well. This part of the analysis also addresses
whether any correlation exists between the area and
circularity.
It is hypothesized that the global warming signal
in surface temperatures would be associated with a
reduction in area in the NHCPV over time as the cold
pool of air over the poles shrinks. Furthermore, if the
area decreases over the period, the NHCPV may become
more meridional (i.e. less circular) because zonal winds
may decrease when the temperature increases at the poles.
However, because the January results failed to identify
linear decreases in area as hypothesized (Rohli et al.,
2005), further analysis of other months is needed to
supplement the previous January analysis.
A third component of the research analyzes whether
any change in position of the NHCPV is evident over
time. It is expected that the mean position of the NHCPV
would be located near the North Pole. However, a
shift from the pole to (say) a centroid over Siberia
would suggest that the cold pool has shifted equatorward
over Asia and concurrent surface environmental changes
would likely occur.
Furthermore, even if no changes in area, circularity,
or position are observed in the NHCPV, the NHCPV
could still show two very different patterns and have
varying impacts because the shape may simply have
rotated about the same centroid. Differentiation between
two such patterns is performed through correlation of
the NHCPV properties to atmospheric teleconnection
indices. The teleconnections represent pressure oscilla-
tions around fixed points around the world. This part of
the study is important because any association between
variability in the area and/or circularity of the NHCPV
and variability in teleconnection patterns would suggest
that the regional-scale teleconnections fluctuate as the
overall, holistic pattern varies. By contrast, the absence
of such a correlation would suggest that regional changes
could occur in the absence of (or independently of) varia-
tion in the overall holistic pattern. It is hypothesized that
the teleconnections studied correlate with the geometric
properties of the NHCPV.
DATA AND METHODS
Data
The same data set from Rohli et al. (2005) is employed
here. Specifically, mean monthly 500 hPa geopotential
height data from 1959 to 2001 were obtained from
the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR,
2003). This data set was selected so that results would
be comparable both to results from the January analysis
and from previous work (Burnett, 1993). The daily
observational data are projected to a 5° by 5° grid
including the entire Northern Hemisphere and are then
averaged to produce the monthly mean. Limitations of the
data set are described in Rohli et al. (2005). The analysis
of 5 months per year (February, April, July, October, and
December) to augment the previously analyzed January
climatology provides for analysis in the annual cycle,
with more detail in the winter season when the NHCPV
is most robust and influential on the hemispheric-scale
climatology.
To address the question of whether the geometrical
attributes of the NHCPV are associated with atmospheric
teleconnections, several standardized monthly indices
were examined. These indices were obtained from the
Climate Prediction Center (CPC, 2003) and the National
Climatic Data Center (NCDC, 2003). Specifically, data
were gathered for the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)
and Ni~
no 3.4 Index to represent the El Ni~
no/Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, along with indices rep-
resenting the AO, PNA pattern, North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (CPC,
2003; NCDC, 2003).
Methodology
The size of the data set permits statistical analysis of
the NHCPV properties by month (e.g. examination of
long-term changes in the January NHCPV, etc.). A
specific isohypse is selected to represent the NHCPV for
each month, as recommended by Frauenfeld and Davis,
2003, Table I. The 5460 hPa isohypse was selected to
delineate the December and February NHCPV. Because
the same isohypse was used for January, it is possible
that the NHCPV may be over-represented in the core
winter month of January compared with the more `fringe'
months of December and February. Nevertheless, we use
the months suggested by Frauenfeld and Davis (2003),
who studied geopotential height change by analyzing
both daily and monthly mean maps along a 5-degree
meridian to identify the isohypse that fell within the
primary baroclinic zone to best represent the NHCPV.

The area and circularity of the NHCPV were compared
within a month (e.g. Januaries can be compared against
Januaries) using the predefined isohypse to represent the
equatorward margin of the NHCPV.
For each of the 215 months (5 months ×43 years)
of the analysis, the corresponding height (Table I) was
contoured, the area and perimeter of the CPV in each
month were calculated using the `XTools' algorithm
(Delaune, 2000), and the centroid of each monthly
NHCPV was calculated using the `center of mass'
criterion (Ciudad, 2002). An example of the analysis
is shown in Figure 1. Regression analysis determined
whether the area of the NHCPV exhibits linear change
over time for each of the 5 months analyzed.
The map projection is of great importance to this
research, since results may vary depending on the projec-
tion used (Rohli et al., 2005). More specifically, a map
projection that preserves shape but distorts area would
portray the size of the CPV incorrectly. Likewise, if a pro-
jection that preserves area but distorts shape were used
to identify the centroid of the CPV, the results would
be incorrect. Therefore, this research uses the Lambert's
equal-area projection to address the research questions
that depend on equivalency (i.e. preservation of area) and
the conformal (i.e. shape-preserving) polar stereographic
projection when identifying the centroid (Robinson et al.,
1984).
Both projections were used to define the shape of
the CPV. The perimeter of a given CPV, projected
in the stereographic projection, was recorded and used
as the circumference of a reference circle. The radius
was then derived from that circumference and used to
determine the area of that reference circle. Then, the area
of a given CPV projected in the Lambert's equal-area
projection was divided by the area of the reference circle
to determine the circularity ratio (Rc, Rohli et al., 2005).
Therefore, Rc is directly proportional to the circularity

of the NHCPV, with small values of Rc suggestive of
amplified and/or more longwave ridges and troughs. Rc
was used to address the hypothesis regarding NHCPV
circularity. Regression analysis was again used to identify
linear temporal trends in Rc and Pearson correlations
were computed between area and Rc of the NHCPV.
To address the third hypothesis, visualization tech-
niques and CrimeStat II software (Levine, 2002) were
used to show temporal changes in the position of the cen-
troid of the NHCPV over the 1959­2001 period. Changes
in the centroid location would suggest that the CPV
shifted poleward over one area and simultaneously equa-
torward over another area, and may explain why some
places warmed and others cooled simultaneously dur-
ing the 1959­2001 period of overall warming. After the
centroid of each NHCPV was calculated and recorded,
several analyses were performed using CrimeStat II soft-
ware. These analyses included identifying nearest neigh-
bor indices (NNI) and `hotspots' using spatial clustering,
and computing the directional mean and circular vari-
ance, where 0 represents no variability and 1 represents
very high variability (Levine, 2002).
Next, Pearson correlations were used to determine
whether the NHCPV area and Rc correlate significantly
with any of the teleconnection indices. Each of the
months analyzed was included in this analysis, with one
exception. July was not correlated with the PNA pattern,
because the PNA index is not prominent in the summer
months (Barnston and Livezey, 1987).
RESULTS
The results for each of the months analyzed can be found

The NHCPV area, circularity, and position
Winter. Both December and February results corrobo-
rate the results found for January by Rohli et al. (2005).
The mean NHCPV tends to grow through the tradition-
ally defined winter season, with the December NHCPV
displaying a smaller mean area (7.036 × 107 km2) than
that for January, and February exhibiting the largest
mean area (8.544 × 107 km2) of the winter months. This
result coincides with what is expected given the delayed
onset of seasons over maritime areas such as the North
Pole. Figure 2 identifies the characteristics of the winter
NHCPV, with the smallest area occurring in Decem-
ber 1990 (6.381 × 107 km2), the largest area occurring

in February 1986 (8.544 × 107 km2), the `most circular'
NHCPV in February 1990 (0.786), and the `least circular'
in January 1963 (0.497, as in Figure 2(d) of Rohli et al.,
2005). Furthermore, the circularity of the NHCPV also
decreases throughout the winter, with December being
`most circular' on average, with a mean Rc of 0.706, and
February being `least circular' (mean Rc of 0.683).
Like January, December and February's NHCPV areas
were distributed normally around the mean, with no
significant skewness or kurtosis. However, the Decem-
ber Rc distribution was significantly negatively skewed
(zskewness
= -2.869, p-value = 0.003), suggesting that
most December NHCPVs were more circular than the
mean Rc. This result is consistent with that found for
the January Rc as reported by Rohli et al. (2005). Unlike
January, which showed a leptokurtic distribution of Rc
(Rohli et al., 2005), no kurtosis was identified for Rc in
December or February. Therefore, the January NHCPV
seems to be very consistent in circularity, while Decem-
bers and Februaries are more likely to have anomalously
large or small Rc.
The regression analysis did not identify any signifi-
cant linear temporal trends in the December (p-value =
0.901) or February (p-value = 0.122) NHCPV area.
Again, these results support those reported previously for
January (Rohli et al., 2005). Similarly, trends in Rc for
December (p-value = 0.091) and February (p-value =
0.105) were not statistically significant, similar to the
results from Rohli et al. (2005), which suggest no trend
in January circularity (p-value = 0.453). Therefore, no
statistically significant temporal changes in polar-tropical
exchange in energy are apparent, but because of the
implications of this result for global circulation changes
in winter, this phenomenon should be investigated fur-
ther. No significant correlation was identified between
area and Rc for December or February, corroborating the
previous results for January. Thus, it appears that changes
in the winter NHCPV area are independent of circularity.
To examine the position of the NHCPV, the cen-
troids for each December and (in a separate analy-
sis) February were plotted. This analysis resulted in
an almost identical pattern to that observed for Jan-
uary (Rohli et al., 2005). Figure 3(a) shows that most
December centroids fell in the western hemisphere, with
a directional mean at 85°12 53.88 N, 177°15 18.72 W,
and falling 532.7 km from the North Pole. Like-
wise, the February centroids showed a mean position
at 85°42 15.48 N, 175°41 21.12 W, 478.2 km from the
North Pole (Figure 3(b)). The position of the winter
NHCPV seems to be displaced toward northwestern
North America during most of the 1959­2001 period.
The circular variance for each winter month was low,
ranging from 0.09 in December to 0.11 in February.
Rose diagrams further depict this displacement, with
an average of 77% of the points falling at longitudes
between Alaska and Siberia in December (Figure 4(a))
and January (Figure 4(b)). However, the February rose
diagram shows a slight increase in variance over the
1959­2001 period (Figure 4(c)). Perhaps this result is not
unexpected as February may display more characteristics
of a transition month, with slightly higher interannual
variability.
Further examination for clusters in the overall point
pattern revealed significant NNIs for each of the winter
months, ranging from 0.534 in December to 0.618
in January (p-value < 0.001). Therefore, the overall
point pattern distribution for the NHCPV centroids was
more clustered than random in each winter month.
However, significant (p-value < 0.05) clusters, or hot
spots, were only found for the January and February
NHCPV (Figure 5), if the minimum number of points
required for a cluster is set to three.
April. April was chosen to represent spring and the
5580 hPa isohypse was selected to represent the April
NHCPV (Frauenfeld and Davis, 2003). The largest area
was found in 1978 (Figure 6(a)) and the smallest area
was in 1962 (Figure 6(b)). Likewise, the most circular
NHCPV occurred in 1985 (Figure 6(c)) and the most
meridional April was 1983 (Figure 6(d)). Furthermore,
the April NHCPV area data were evenly distributed
around a mean of 7.877 × 107 km2 (zskewness
= 1.834,

zkurtosis
= -0.372). Although no kurtosis was found in the
Rc data (zkurtosis
= 1.519), the Rc distribution was signifi-
cantly negatively skewed (zskewness
= -2.785, p-value =
0.005). Therefore, most April NHCPVs were more cir-
cular than the mean Rc of 0.698.
Examination for trends in the area and Rc of the April
NHCPV produced similar results to that of the winter
months. Regression analysis revealed no linear tempo-
ral trends in area (p-value = 0.604) or Rc (p-value =
0.769). The April NHCPV, like the winter months, found
only short and weak temporal changes over the period.
Finally, as for the winter months, no correlation between
the area and Rc was identified (r = -0.002, p-value =
0.992).
On the other hand, results for the April NHCPV did
display very different results than those found in winter
for centroid position throughout 1959­2001 (Figure 7).
The mean centroid was located over the Atlantic side
of the Arctic Ocean at 87°51 36.36 N, 36°14 25.08 W,
falling only 238.2 km from the North Pole, and the
circular variance was much greater at 0.69. The rose
diagram (Figure 8) shows the wide distribution of the
April centroids around the North Pole, with the majority
(16%) located between 60°W and 85°W. The distribution
was much wider in April than in any other month
analyzed.
The April results also identified a NNI of 1.02, or
a centroid distribution that is random. Not surprisingly,
the variability in the NHCPV movement precluded the
identification of clusters. Interestingly, April is the only
month with most of the centroids located near the North
Pole. These results are not surprising because of the
transitional nature of the spring hemispheric circulation.
July. The summer NHCPV is represented by July,
and the 5700 hPa isohypse (Frauenfeld and Davis, 2003)
was contoured and used for the analysis of the area,
circularity, and centroid. The largest NHCPV occurred in
1992 (Figure 9(a)), the smallest in 1998 (Figure 9(b)), the
most circular in 1995 (Figure 9(c)), and the least circular
in 2001 (Figure 9(d)). It should be noted that 2 years
(1965 and 1968) were eliminated because the data were
deemed to be spurious. Neither skewness (zskewness
=
-1.486 for area and zskewness
= 0.133 for Rc) nor kurtosis
(zkurtosis
= 0.145 for area and zkurtosis
= 0.076 for Rc) was
found in the area or Rc. Therefore, the data were normally
distributed around the mean area of 5.808 × 107 km2 and
around the mean Rc of 0.689.
Like the winter months, regression analysis did not
identify a significant decreasing linear temporal trend in
area (p-value = 0.083). Furthermore, no significant tem-
poral trend in Rc was observed (p-value = 0.925). A
significant positive relationship between the July NHCPV
area and circularity (Pearson r = 0.323, p-value =
0.039) was observed. Thus, a large (small) area of the
July NHCPV is associated with a more (less) circular
July NHCPV. This result suggests that Julies with anoma-
lously small NHCPVs may at least partially offset their
inability to advect cooler air southward by having more
and/or larger troughs. This result should be investigated
further.

The July pattern resumed the winter tendency to
have centroid displacement toward the Pacific Basin.
All except one of the centroids (July 1988) fell within
the western hemisphere (Figure 10). The directional
mean was located at 87°54 18.72 N, 112°45 12.60 W,
233.2 km from the North Pole. July displayed a very low
circular variance of 0.06 and was the least variable of
all the months analyzed. The variability is shown further
in the rose diagram (Figure 11). The July centroids iden-
tified a more persistent pattern, with a significant NNI
of 0.698 (p-value < 0.0001). One first-order cluster was
found at the 0.05 probability level, containing five points
(Figure 12). Compared to the clusters found in the win-
ter months (Figure 5), July's cluster position was closer
to the North Pole and centered north of Canada and
Greenland.
October. The October NHCPV was analyzed to
represent the autumn hemispheric-scale extratropical
circulation and was represented by the 5580 hPa (Frauen-
feld and Davis, 2003). The largest NHCPV occurred
in 1976 (Figure 13(a)), while the smallest area was
found in 1991 (Figure 13(b)). Similarly, the most cir-
cular NHCPV occurred in 1990 (Figure 13(c)) and the
most meridional was in 1967 (Figure 13(d)). The mean
NHCPV area of 6.286 × 107 km2 showed no signifi-
cant skewness (zskewness
= 1.578). However, the distri-
bution of areas was found to be significantly leptokurtic
(zkurtosis
= 2.530, p-value = 0.011), suggesting that the
data has smaller tails around the mean than that of a
normal distribution. Furthermore, the October NHCPV
Rc was found to be negatively skewed (zskewness
=
-7.711, p-value < 0.001) and leptokurtic (zkurtosis
=
16.947, p-value < 0.001), suggesting that most Octo-
ber NHCPVs were more circular than the mean Rc
of 0.724, with relatively few high- or low-circularity
anomalies.
Regression analysis did not identify a linear temporal
change in the October NHCPV area (p-value = 0.999),
but did suggest a significantly increasing linear trend in
Rc (p-value = 0.022). Therefore, the NHCPV became
more circular over the 1959­2001 period (Figure 14).
Whether this increasing circularity is a cause or an effect
of a global warming signal is a question for future
research. Visually, it seems that 1976 (the largest October
NHCPV) is an anomaly compared to the other October
areas, and 1967 (the least circular shape) is an anomaly
compared to the other October Rc values. Finally, Spear-
man correlations did not find a significant relationship
between the area and Rc (r = -0.083, p-value = 0.600),
suggesting that the two may not be influenced by the same
factor.

The October NHCPV centroid results resemble those
in the winter months and July (Figure 15). The centroids
were again displaced toward the Pacific with a mean
centroid located at 85°48 35.28 N, 168°4 30.72 W, about
466.5 km from the North Pole. The circular variance was
relatively small at 0.11. Furthermore, Figure 16 shows a
high percentage (77%) of the centroids located between
Alaska and Siberia.
The cluster analysis reveals a significant NNI of 0.609
(p-value < 0.001), suggesting that the overall distribu-
tion was significantly more clustered than random. Fur-
thermore, two first-order clusters were found at the
0.05 probability level, with the first cluster including
five points and the second cluster including four points
(Figure 12). Both clusters were located in the same area
as the clusters found in the winter months, leading to the
conclusion that the autumn NHCPV acts similar to the
winter NHCPV.
The NHCPV and regional and hemispheric flow patterns
To investigate the NHCPV further, associations between
the NHCPV area and monthly atmospheric teleconnec-
tion indices, and in separate analyses, between Rc and the
same atmospheric teleconnection indices, were examined
using Pearson correlation analysis. Any observed linkage
between the NHCPV and regional-scale teleconnections
would suggest that the geographical position of the long-
wave ridge­trough configuration of the NHCPV tends to
be `anchored' to certain locations. By contrast, an absence
of linkage may imply that the NHCPV can `rotate' about
a constant centroid (i.e. alter the ridge/trough configu-
ration, as represented by teleconnection indices) without
changing its area or shape.
The Pearson correlation results between the area (and
Rc) and each of the monthly atmospheric teleconnection
indices are shown in Table II. Five significant correla-
tions occur in December, more than any other month
analyzed. First, the December NHCPV area was sig-
nificantly positively correlated with the PNA pattern.
Therefore, as the PNA teleconnection goes into a pos-
itive phase, with an amplified ridge­trough pattern over
North America (Leathers and Palecki, 1992), the overall
area of the December NHCPV tends to increase.
The December NHCPV area also correlated signifi-
cantly with the AO, and actually had the strongest cor-
relation of all variable pairs analyzed. Thus, the negative
(positive) phase of the AO, with above- (below) normal
sea level pressure (SLP) over the Arctic and anomalously
low (high) SLP in lower latitudes and cold (warm) con-
ditions particularly in northern Europe, is linked to an
anomalously large (small) NHCPV. This result implies

that when the December NHCPV is anomalously large
(small), midlatitude temperatures in the Northern Hemi-
sphere are anomalously low (high). It is noteworthy that
Rohli et al. (2005) found a similar result for January.
Not surprisingly, because of the similarity between
the AO and its regional expression, the NAO (Marshall
et al., 2001; Rogers and McHugh, 2002), a significant
negative relationship also exists between the December
NHCPV area and NAO. A positive phase of the NAO is
associated with a strong Icelandic Low, strong westerlies
across the North Atlantic, and high-pressure along 40°N
(Wallace and Gutzler, 1981); during such periods, the
December NHCPV decreases in area. By contrast, a
large December NHCPV is linked to weakened westerlies
across the north Atlantic basin typical of negative NAO
Decembers.

The December NHCPV Rc correlated significantly
with two teleconnections. First, as was found for January
(Rohli et al., 2005) a significant negative relationship
was found between Rc and the PNA pattern. This result
suggests that a decrease (increase) in circularity (i.e. an
increase (decrease) in ridge and trough amplification over
North America) is coincident with increased (decreased)
ridging/troughing across the hemispheric Rossby wave-
train hemisphere as a whole. However, it should be
noted that because the PNA-related ridging/troughing is
a subset of the entire hemispheric NHCPV, a correlation
between these two variables should not be surprising.
Nevertheless, this result, when combined with results for
other winter months (discussed in the following text),
suggests that the winter PNA pattern appears to represent
a subset of the hemispheric-scale circulation variability
that is not offset by coincident opposite amplification
tendencies elsewhere.
The other significant December relationship is a posi-
tive association between the Rc and the AO. Thus, when
the AO was in a `warm' (cold), or positive (negative),
phase, the NHCPV was more (less) circular. It is interest-
ing that both the area and Rc are tied to the AO, with the
positive (negative) phase of the AO linked to a smaller
and less circular (larger and more circular) December
NHCPV.
No other significant correlations were found between
the December NHCPV area and Rc. Interestingly, as was
the case in January (Rohli et al., 2005) neither the SOI
nor Ni~
no 3.4 correlated significantly with either the area
or Rc of the NHCPV, suggesting that El Ni~
no creates
regional changes to the flow, but may not affect the
NHCPV acting as a whole. Furthermore, no significant
correlations between the latitude and longitude of the
centroid and either of the ENSO indices were identified,
for any of the months.
Three teleconnections were found to correlate signifi-
cantly with the area of the February NHCPV (Table II).
First, the PNA pattern was found to be positively cor-
related with the area. Thus, as the PNA teleconnec-
tion moved into a positive (negative) phase, the area
of the NHCPV increased (decreased). The correlation
was found for December. Furthermore, even though the
February pattern did not show a significant link between
Rc and the PNA pattern, the significant negative cor-
relations for the other two winter months between the
circularity and PNA teleconnection suggest that this tele-
connection may be an important winter `anchor' for both
the area and the circularity of the NHCPV. Only winter

months showed strong correlations between the PNA and
the NHCPV.
The AO and the NHCPV area are significantly neg-
atively related in February, as in the other two winter
months. Once again, the uniform response for the AO in
all the three winter months suggests that this pattern was
a dominant feature associated with variability in NHCPV
area. Finally, the area was also significantly negatively
correlated with the NAO. While the area of the February
NHCPV correlated significantly with three teleconnec-
tions, the Rc did not correlate significantly with any of
the teleconnections studied.
Two significant correlations were identified in April
(Table II). A significant negative relationship was found
between the area and AO, as was the case for all the three
winter months. According to Wallace and Gutzler (1981),
temperatures increase (decrease) around the North Pole
when the AO is in a positive (negative) phase. Likewise,
a significant negative relationship was found between
the area and the closely related NAO. Once again, this
tendency mimics the results found for most of the winter
months. No other significant correlations were found in
either the area or circularity.
Only one significant correlation was found for July:
a positive correlation between the area and Ni~
no 3.4
(Table II). The positive phase of the Ni~
no 3.4 index is
associated with anomalously high SSTs in the region
bounded by 5°N and 5°S and 170° ­120°W; when the
index is in its positive phase, the July NHCPV area
increases (Newman et al., 2003). July is the only month
in which the Ni~
no 3.4 or SOI seems to be an important
factor associated with NHCPV geometric properties.
This result is interesting because the effects of the
ENSO phenomenon have been regarded to be more
magnified in winter rather than summer (Newman et al.,
2003). Perhaps the great distance between the pressure
fluctuation and the NHCPV is associated with a greater
time lag in the effects of ENSO on the NHCPV than
in the tropics and midlatitudes. July also had the fewest
significant correlations of any month analyzed.
Two atmospheric teleconnections were found to be
related to the October NHCPV (Table II). First, a sig-
nificant negative relationship exists between Rc and the
PNA pattern. As the PNA index becomes positive (neg-
ative), the NHCPV becomes less (more) circular. This
result suggests that, as was the case for December and
January, the PNA-related ridge­trough configuration was
propagated around the hemisphere rather than compen-
sated by opposite anomalies of amplification upstream or
downstream. Perhaps the PNA pattern tends to become
established as a part of the hemispheric Rossby wave-
train in autumn and persists into the early part of the
winter.
In addition, October is the only month analyzed
to show significant (negative) correlations between the
NHCPV and the PDO. Specifically, the Rc became less

(more) circular as the northern Pacific SSTs demon-
strate a positive (negative) `warm' (`cold') phase of the
PDO (Newman et al., 2003). This result should be inter-
preted with caution, however, because the period of the
PDO is long ­ approximately 20 to 30 years (Newman
et al., 2003) ­ while the period studied only consisted of
43 years. Therefore, the true nature of the PDO-induced
variability may not appear to a sufficient degree dur-
ing the study period. No other correlations were found
between the teleconnections and either area or Rc.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
The geometric properties of the monthly averaged
NHCPV, including area, circularity, and centroid loca-
tion, were examined seasonally over the 1959­2001
period. Relationships between the area and circularity of
the NHCPV and several atmospheric circulation indices
were identified. For these analyses, the months of Decem-
ber and February were chosen to supplement the previ-
ously studied January to provide a clear picture of the
NHCPV's wintertime properties. April, July, and October
were chosen to represent spring, summer, and autumn,
respectively.
It was hypothesized that the area of the NHCPV would
decrease over the 1959­2001 period in association with
the concurrent general hemispheric warming trend. How-
ever, no significant linear trends in area were found
for any of the months analyzed over the period stud-
ied. Only October showed a significant linear temporal
trend in NHCPV circularity (Rc), and that trend was
toward increasing circularity over time. If global warm-
ing decreases the latitudinal temperature gradient, then
decreased NHCPV circularity might be expected, but the
presence of a linear trend in Rc only in October leaves
little convincing evidence for a global warming signal in
the monthly 500 hPa NHCPV area and circularity. Inter-
estingly, July was the only month to identify a correlation
between the area and Rc.
The third research question stated that the NHCPV
should be centered on the North Pole. However, April and
July were the only two months to support this hypothesis.
For most of the 215 months in the period (43 years,
5 months per year), the NHCPV position showed a strong
displacement toward the Pacific basin, north of Alaska
and Siberia. This result supports that which was found
previously for January. Only April displayed a tendency
for centroid displacement toward the Atlantic basin.
Perhaps the greater increase in sea ice accumulation
over the Atlantic as compared to the Pacific in late
winter causes the baroclinic zone and NHCPV to shift
equatorward over the Atlantic by April. By contrast, early
in the winter, sea ice is already accumulated over the
Pacific sector. Most of the months showed a low circular
variability for the centroid location, suggesting that the
position did not move drastically between 1959 and 2001.
In winter, the intense cooling of the landmasses may
possibly cause the zone of air mass contrast (and therefore
also the midlatitude westerlies, polar front jet stream, and
the NHCPV) to be displaced equatorward over this land-
dominated region. The PNA teleconnection pattern could
be causing a shift in the NHCPV. Therefore, when the
PNA teleconnection is in a positive or even in a `neutral'
phase, the trough in the Alaska to Siberia region may
cause the NHCPV centroid to migrate in that direction.
The NNI analysis suggested that the point pattern of
NHCPV centroid is random in April and October, while
the centroid tends to exhibit a more preferred location in
winter and summer. Identifiable spatial clusters of at least
a few months within the 1959­2001 period were found
in most of the monthly analyses, with no identifiable
spatial clusters in December and April. The winter and
autumn clusters were located north of Alaska and Siberia,
while the summer cluster was north of Greenland. The
research illustrated that the winter and autumn NHCPV
centroid seems to be positioned similarly, while the
spring NHCPV position seems to differ from the other
seasons, perhaps because of increases in accumulation of
sea ice in late winter in the Atlantic sector.
Relationships between teleconnections and NHCPV
variability throughout the year were also analyzed. It
was expected that correlations between the indices of
the teleconnections studied and the area and Rc of the
NHCPV would be found. Results showed that the SO (as
represented by the SOI) is the only teleconnection that
did not correlate with area or Rc in any of the months
analyzed. Another indicator of ENSO, the Ni~
no 3.4 index,
was significantly (negatively) correlated only with the
July area. By contrast, Pearson correlations identified
several significant relationships between the NHCPV
and the PNA pattern, including a positive correlation to
NHCPV area in December and February, and a negative
correlation with Rc in December and October (along
with the previously identified January). Likewise, the AO
shows a strong relationship to the NHCPV in several
months, including a negative correlation with the area
in December, February, and April (along with January)
and a positive correlation with the Rc in December. A
closely related teleconnection to the AO is the NAO, but
the NAO was negatively correlated with the area only
in December, February, and April. Finally, the PDO was
significantly negatively correlated with the October Rc.
Thus, this hypothesis was partially confirmed; some links
to the well-known modes of low-frequency variability in
atmospheric flow were found.
The results of this research provide further questions
that should be investigated. For example, more months
could be analyzed to represent the spring, summer,
and autumn seasons more comprehensively than in this
study. Also, daily analysis of the geometric properties
of the NHCPV would provide more insight into the
nature of spatial and temporal variability at submonthly
timescales. Likewise, the addition of more vertical levels
of analysis would provide further information about
the degree to which the NHCPV acts as a barotropic
system. Finally, additional analysis should be conducted

to investigate possible forcing mechanisms for the long-
term centroid migration of the NHCPV and associations
to teleconnections.
Because broad-scale atmospheric circulation impacts
environmental surface features such as temperature and
precipitation and a wide range of dependent environmen-
tal conditions, it is important to understand the charac-
teristics of the circulation (Davis and Benkovic, 1994).
Results from this research provide clues to understanding
the puzzle of long-term atmospheric circulation variabil-
ity. After the characteristics and processes behind broad-
scale atmospheric circulation are understood, the range
of possible impacts on social systems, and communi-
ties' impact on climate from macro- to local-scale, can
begin to be understood. Eventually, such knowledge of
this `cascade of linkages' (Terjung, 1976) can contribute
to the development of physical-human-process-response
systems ­ the highest level of scholarship in geographical
climatology (Terjung, 1976).
