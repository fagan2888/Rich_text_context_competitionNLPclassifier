Introduction
In a competitive market, the degree of an organization's ori-
entation becomes crucial for an organization to stay competi-
tive in the uncertain and competitive business environment
(Goldman & Grinstein, 2010). Among the various types of
sectors, the service sector has become one of the major con-
tributors to Malaysian economy. As seen, service sector con-
tributed approximately 50% of the nation's real gross
domestic product (GDP) over the past few years and in addi-
tion to that, the hotel industry is said to be one of the major
contributors to Malaysian economy (Khairil, Isyak, Radzi, &
Taha, 2008). Thus, to achieve Malaysia's 2020 vision of
making tourist industry the largest industry in Malaysia, the
hotel industry needs to improve on market orientation (MO)
and service quality (SQ) for better organizational perfor-
mance (OP; M. B. Lopez, 2010).
Past studies have shown the positive relationship between
MO and OP and further confirmed the importance of MO in
determining firm performance (Ahmad, 2011; Chao &
Spillan, 2010; Eris & Ozmen, 2012; Hoq & Chauhan, 2011;
Sullivan & Butler, 2009). On another note, SQ appeared to
be another critical measure of OP especially in service orga-
nizations (Voon, 2005). The influence of SQ to create
competitive advantage for organizations has been validated
by various studies (e.g., Hojati, Shahin, & Shirouyehzad,
2012; Gounaris, Stathakopoulos, & Athanassopoulos, 2003)
and generally bring effect on customer satisfaction as well
(Arasli, Katircioglu, & Mehtap-Smadi, 2005; Zeithaml &
Bitner, 2003) and subsequently better business performance
(Kersten & Koch, 2010). This paper is organized as follows.
First, discussion of past literatures and hypotheses, method-
ology, and analysis of the results are highlighted. Next, the
limitation of the study and directions for future research are
pointed out.
Despite the importance of MO and SQ in determining OP,
it is important to know how these variables are related to
each other. Based on the research by Aziz, Yassin, and
Ahmad (2010), they postulated that MO practices are posi-
tively associated with firm performance as well as service

Market Orientation and Organizational
Performance: The Moderating Role of
Service Quality
Chee-Hua Chin1, May-Chiun Lo1, and T. Ramayah2
Abstract
Orientation plays a vital role for organizations to compete to create sustainable competitive advantage. The objective of this
study is to examine the relationship between market orientation (MO) and organizational performance (OP) with service
quality (SQ) as a moderator in the context of the hotel industry in Malaysia. MO and OP were conceptualized as three- and
two-dimensional constructs, respectively, whereas SQ, which consists of two-dimensional constructs, namely, technical
quality and functional quality, was used as a moderator. Data were gathered through a survey using a structured questionnaire
with a sample of 187 executive-level employees employed in hotels rated three stars and above in Malaysia. SmartPLS 2.0
(M3) with path modeling and bootstrapping was used to examine the standard error of the estimate and t-values. The findings
suggest that only competitor orientation dimension of MO was significantly related to OP, whereas customer orientation and
inter-functional coordination were not related. Interestingly, SQ was found to have moderated the relationship between MO
and performance of the hotels in Malaysia. SQ exists to fill in the gap between customers' expectations and their perception
of the service providers' performance that further creates differentiation and competitive advantage, which enhance MO
practices and ultimately lead to improvements in the firm's performance. Implications of the findings, potential limitations of
the study, and directions for future research are highlighted.

organization in the context of Malaysia (Ramayah, Samat, &
Lo, 2011). Besides that, SQ was also found to have signifi-
cant impact on Malaysian universities'performance from the
perspective of international students (Shekarchizadeh, Rasli,
& Tat, 2011). In realizing the importance of OP, firms' pur-
sued to enhance their performance to obtain differentiation in
the market (Miguel, Silva, Chiosini, & Schutzer, 2009)
through MO practices (Rodrigues & Pinho, 2010) and SQ
concentration (Lasser, Manolis, & Winsor, 2000). In addi-
tion, better SQ provided by organizations would result in bet-
ter customer satisfaction and customers' loyalty, and further
resulted in increased customers' retention (Levesque &
McDougall, 1996). Hence, MO and SQ are posited to influ-
ence OP, but those studies did not look at the link between
MO, SQ, and OP. Thus, this paper tries to fill that gap by
conceptualizing SQ as a moderator in the relationship
between MO and OP. This paper examines the importance of
MO and SQ that may lead to superior OP in which OP is
taken as a dependent variable. Two major objectives devel-
oped for the present study are as follows:
1. to investigate the relationship between MO and OP
and
2. to examine the impact of SQ in moderating the rela-
tionship between MO and OP.
Conceptual Background and
Hypotheses Market Orientation and
Organizational Performance
MO
Kohli and Jaworski (1990) were the first practitioners who
started investigating MO with three major components,
namely, intelligence gathering, intelligence dissemination,
and responsiveness to market intelligence in their research
and defined MO as a firm implementing the marketing con-
cept to achieve firm superior performance. Later, this topic
was further examined by previous researchers (for example,
Narver and Slater (1990); Homburg and Pflesser (2000)) that
MO would lead to superior value for customers and subse-
quently resulted in better performances of the organizations
(Faryabi, Tajvidi, & Tajvidi, 2011; Ramayah et al., 2011).
Levitt (1960) posited that MO is needed in business man-
agement and administration to increase firm performance. As
stated by Parasuraman, Berry, and Zeithaml (1988), market-
ing skills as well as MO were needed in organization to fulfill
customers' needs and satisfaction. In addition, with the skills
available, the organizations can make use of MOs and convert
into marketing capabilities effectively to gain competitive
advantage (Liu & Wang, 2009). In addition to that, Caruana,
Money, and Berthon (2000) proposed that market-oriented
organizations would be able to deliver superior customer
value and satisfaction. Past studies have indicated that mar-
ket-oriented organizations use inter-functional capabilities to
create market-driven customer value (Day, 1994) and cus-
tomer orientation (CO) and inter-functional coordination
(IFC) were important criteria for service companies. Martin
and Grbac (2003) described MO as a strategy to create com-
petitive advantage to satisfy customers (Chao & Spillan,
2010; Kok & Biemans, 2009).
CO.Lafferty and Hult (2001) defined CO as a firm must
understand the potential customer needs, satisfy customer's
needs, and creating value to them in a continuous basis for
sustainable competitive advantage (Taleghani, Gilaninia, &
Talab, 2013). Kirca, Jayachandran, and Bearden (2005)
stated that the adoption of CO requires firms to collect infor-
mation about customers and act as an advantage to identify
and satisfy customer's needs and wants through the applica-
tion of customer data (Kok & Biemans, 2009). Thus, due to
the fluctuated of customer's demand, CO requires firms to
target customers in a strategic way to save cost (Zhou,
Brown, & Dev, 2009), and CO is also recognized as a firms'
co-creator for value creation (Lewrick, Omar, & Williams,
2011), which will further increase firm performance (Kai &
Fan, 2010).
Competitor orientation (CPO). CPO was defined as the ability
to understand the competitor's short term strengths and
weaknesses and its long term capabilities and strategies to
generate competitive advantage in the organizations (Zhou
et al., 2009). S. P. Lopez, Peon, and Ordas (2005) mentioned
that the collaborative organizational culture enables firms to
improve competitive performance. Hence, the importance
for firms to understand their current and predicted future
competitors was highlighted (Kai & Fan, 2010). However,
firms that overly focus on CPO might reduce their own inno-
vations (Lukas & Ferrell, 2000) because they tend to follow
their competitor's path by producing similar products to
compete in the market. Hence, it is important for organiza-
tions to find out their competitors'information and strategies
for the organization to plan and construct strategic strategies
and increase competitive advantage.
IFC. IFC was defined as the coordinated efforts of an organi-
zation's resources in creating superior value to customers
(Narver & Slater, 1990) and to generate the cooperation
among all departments in the organizations to create superior
value for customers (Wooldridge & Minsky, 2002). Porter
(1980) mentioned that each employee has to play his or her
own role effectively and efficiently in each department to
generate sustainable competitive advantage for the firm, and
each unit must clearly understand their job scope and specifi-
cation (Narver & Slater, 1990). Farzad, Nahavandi, and Caru-
ana (2008) postulated that employees are no longer people
who provide goods or services to customers, but they work as
a team that coordinated into functional area. A recent study
proposed that IFC be noted as an important determinant to
create the ability for employees to work around conflicting
Chin et al. 3
perspectives (Auh & Menguc, 2005) and different depart-
ments or functions in an organization cooperating to work
together to achieve certain objectives (Tay & Tay, 2007).
SQ
SQ is essentially important for firms or organizations, espe-
cially service organizations, to create competitive advantage
(C. A. Gronroos, 1988), and there is a need to improve the
SQ as supported by past researches (Camarero, 2007;
Hadikoemoro, 2002). Past researchers defined SQ as exist-
ing to fulfill customer's needs or expectations (Lewis &
Mitchell, 1990) and to satisfy their needs (Juran, 1999).
Cronin and Taylor (1994) defined SQ as a form of attitude
formed in long term throughout the overall evaluation of a
performance (Hoffman & Bateson, 2001).
Gronroos's SQ model had been widely used by recent
researchers (Lien & Kao, 2008; Llewellyn, 2005; Lundahl,
Vegholm, & Silver, 2009). C. A. Gronroos (1990) defined
SQ as a series of activities of intangible nature that take
place in interactions between physical resources (cus-
tomer and service employees) or goods or systems of the
service provider. In addition, the SQ model as proposed
by C. A. Gronroos (1984) consists of two major dimen-
sions that are technical quality (TQ) and functional qual-
ity (FQ). To date, SQ has been commonly used to measure
customer satisfaction by researchers (Cronin & Taylor,
1992; Greenberg, 1990; Konovsky, 2000). A recent stud-
ied that adopted C. A. Gronroos (1984) SQ model, namely,
FQ and TQ, and have show significant relationship
between both TQ and FQ on several variables of customer
satisfaction (Lien & Kao, 2008).
TQ.TQ was widely accepted and significantly affects cus-
tomer's perception toward the service provided (C. A. Gron-
roos, 1982; Rust & Oliver, 1994). C. A. Gronroos (1984)
defined TQ as the quality customers actually receive (result
dimension) and mostly hidden from the customers where
they have little awareness of it (Bopp, 1990). C. A. Gronroos
(2007) explained TQ as what is provided by the service.
FQ. C. A. Gronroos (1984) defined FQ as the way services
are delivered (how) to the customer (process dimension) and
"how" the product or service functions. In a recent publica-
tion by C. A. Gronroos (2007), FQ is defined as the charac-
teristics of service provider and its employees, and how the
customer perceives the service process. The related charac-
teristics include professionalism and skills, attitudes and
behavior, accessibility and flexibility, and reliability and
trustworthiness (C. A. Gronroos, 2007).
OP
Hamon (2003) defined OP as a variable used to measure the
degree of OP in achieving organizations' objectives,
efficiency, and effectiveness in achieving their goals
(Robbins & Coulter, 2002). In addition, Ho (2008) defined
OP as an indicator to measure the efficiency of an organiza-
tion to accomplish its objectives, in terms of achieving orga-
nization MO and financial goals (Li, Ragu-Nathan,
Ragu-Nathan, & Rao, 2006).
There are a number of indicators used to measure OP
since 1900; however, among the popular indicators in the
financial performance (FP) construct of OP were profit
growth rate, return on sales (ROS), return on assets (ROA),
and overall performance (Hancott, 2005). Furthermore,
Li et al. (2006) mentioned that OP can be measured in
terms of market performance (MP) and FP, which consists
of organization's profits, return on investments (ROI),
market share, and also growth of sales. Discussions in the
following sections are about two main dimensions of OP,
that is, FP and MP.
FP. FP is defined as the OP in relation to profitability such as
ROA, ROS, sales growth, and overall performance (Dimara,
Skuras, & Tsekouras, 2004; Ho, 2011). Boyd (1995) and
Ocasio (1994) proposed that FP indicators were more on
accounting-based financial indicators. However, some even
argue that FP indicator should be market-based (Hoskisson,
Johnson, & Moesel, 1994). Besides, firms' FP such as return
on equity (ROE) is found to be affected by MO (Tang &
Zhang, 2002) and often being used to evaluate the growth of
profit (Wolff & Pett, 2006).
MP.MP is related to OP in terms of market share growth,
profit ratio, sales growth, or customer satisfaction (Ho, 2011).
A firm's profitability ratios are used to determine how well
the firm performs in the market. If an organization is able to
perform well in terms of market share or profit ratio, it can be
concluded that the organization is doing well in MP. Besides
the numeric measures, the increase in customer satisfaction
can be related to an increase in MP. If customers are satisfied
with the services or products provided, customers' retention
rate will increase. Based on the above view, development of
hypotheses is described in the following section.
Development of Hypotheses
MO and OP
In the past decade, a number of past researches had provided
an empirical support about the positive relationships that
existed between MO and OP (Hanzaee, Nayabzadeh, &
Jalaly, 2012; Nayebzadeh, 2013; Osman, Rashid, Ahmad, &
Rajput, 2011; Slater & Narver, 1994). MO practice is also
found to be positively linked to firm performance in terms
of FP and MP (Chao & Spillan, 2010; Kenneth, Inman,
Brown, & Willis, 2005; Rapp, Beitelspacher, Schillewaert, &
Baker, 2012; Smiraova, Naude, Henneberg, Mouzas, &
Kouchtch, 2011) and the creation of organizational
4 SAGE Open
competencies that lead to superior performance of hotel
industry (Dev, Agarwal, & Erramilli, 2008; Sin, Tse, Yau,
Lee, & Chow, 2004; Subramanian, Kumar, & Strandholm,
2009). Martin and Grbac (2003) found that being competitor
oriented enable firms to respond to the market and fulfill cus-
tomer's needs and results in an increased firm profitability.
IFC is also noted to be positively related to firm performance
by promoting communication and information sharing
among department in a firm (Peters & Fletcher, 2004).
Matsuno, Mentzer, and Ozsomer (2002) argued that there
existed a positive relationship between MOs and market
share. Furthermore, past research also highlighted that MO
practices by focusing on customers centered will positively
link to firm performance, specifically to an increase of firm's
MP besides increased firm's FP (Kenneth et al., 2005). The
study by Zhou et al. (2009) indicated the importance of CO
and CPO in creating a hotel's competitive advantage for bet-
ter business performance. Therefore, the following hypothe-
ses are established:
Hypothesis 1: CO is positively related to OP.
Hypothesis 2: CPO is positively related to OP.
Hypothesis 3: IFC is positively related to OP.
SQ Moderates the Relationship Between MO and
OP
Previous studies highlighted the linkage and positive rela-
tionship between MO and a firm's FP (Camarero, 2007;
Chao & Spillan, 2010; Rapp et al., 2012; Shoham, Rose, &
Kropp, 2005), some even showing the relationship between
SQ and MO (Boo, 2006) and firm performance (Kersten &
Koch, 2010). SQ is also considered to be a critical measure
of OP in terms of FP or MP (Lasser et al., 2000). Moreover,
SQ is also regarded as an important indicator in determining
a firm's FP (Kersten & Koch, 2010). The positive linkage
between SQ and OP as well as MP has been established
(E. Anderson, Fornell, & Lehmann, 1994; Golhar &
Deshpande, 1999). For a firm to stay competitive in the mar-
ket, it should provide differentiation compared with its com-
petitors by developing better SQ (Gounaris et al., 2003) and
improving on MO practices (Ramayah et al., 2011).
Furthermore, a firm that provides superior SQ would increase
MP as well as enhance its corporate image (Arasli et al.,
2005; Baumann, Burton, Elliott, & Kehr, 2007). Researchers
in the past (e.g., Ramayah et al., 2011) highlighted that SQ
has a significant linkage to MO and has an impact on OP.
However, there are no known researches in the past to
have found SQ as a moderator in the relationship between
MO and OP. Hence, the following hypothesis is established:
Hypothesis 4: SQ moderates the relationship between
MO and OP.
Method
Prior to data collection, a pilot study was conducted with 20
randomly selected respondents among the hotels rated three
stars and above in Kuching to ensure the clarity and reliabil-
ity of the questionnaires. A total of 285 questionnaires were
sent out to executives employed at the top, middle, and lower
management level from 57 selected hotels rated three stars
and above in Malaysia. The selection of these hotels was
based on the simple random sampling method and a calcula-
tion of minimum sample size technique (Luck, Taylor, &
Robin, 1987) in which 57 hotels out of 443 registered three
stars and above with the Ministry of Tourism Malaysia
(2011) were selected. The targeted respondents were com-
prised of subordinates who were working executives and
their immediate supervisors who were lower and middle
level managers. Of the 285 questionnaires distributed, 209
(73%) were returned, and only 187 sets were usable. The
majority of the respondents were from lower level of man-
agement (40.61%), followed by middle level of management
(32.1%), and only 18.2% (34 respondents) were from top
level of management. The first section was used to collect
the demographic profile of the respondents. Next, in Section
B, the MKTOR scale developed by Narver and Slater (1990),
which consisted of 14 items, was used to measure the degree
of MO practices in the organizations. For Section C, 11 items
from C. A. Gronroos' (1984) SQ model was used to measure
SQ in their organization. Last, in Section D, 12 items of the
OP scale developed by Kohli and Jaworski (1990) were used
to measure OP. A 7-point Likert-type scale was used, with
1 (strongly disagree), 2 (disagree), 3 (somewhat disagree),
4 (neither agree or disagree), 5 (somewhat agree), 6 (agree),
and 7 (strongly agree; Vagias, 2006).
Findings
This section presents the results of the study. To assess the
research model developed in Figure 1, SmartPLS (M3) was
used to analyze the data collected. This included path model-
ing and then bootstrapping (Chin, 1998; Gudergan, Ringle,
Wende, & Will, 2008; Ringle, Wende, & Will, 2005). A total
of 500 re-samples were used to generate the standard error of
the estimate and t-values. As stated by Chin, Marcolin, and
Newsted (2003), PLS can give more accurate estimates of
moderator effects by accounting for the error that attenuates
the estimated relationships and improves the validation of
theories (Helm, Eggert, & Garnefeld, 2010; Henseler &
Fassott, 2010). First, we tested the convergent validity, which
is the degree to which multiple items to measure the same
concept are in agreement. Next, we proceeded to test the dis-
criminant validity in which the measures are not a reflection
of some other variables and it is indicated by the low correla-
tions between the measure of interest and the measures of
Chin et al. 5
other constructs (Cheung & Lee, 2010). Discriminant valid-
ity can be examined by comparing the squared correlations
between constructs and variance extracted for a construct
(Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Finally, we used the Cronbach's
alpha coefficient to assess the inter-item consistency of our
measurement items (J. C. Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994).
Assessment of the Measurement Model
First, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to
test the item reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant
validity of the measurements scales. As shown in Tables 1
and 2, all the items loading exceeded the minimum cut off
point of .50 (J. C.Anderson & Gerbing, 1988; Bagozzi, Yi, &
Philipps, 1991; Gefen & Straub, 2000); thus, the internal
consistency was achieved. In terms of convergent validity,
all the composite reliability (CR) values were above .70
(Chin, 2010; Hair, Anderson, & Tatham, 1998; Requelme &
Rios, 2010) and the average variance extracted (AVE) values
meet the minimum criteria of .50 (Henseler, Ringle, &
Sinkovics, 2009; Rodgers & Pavlou, 2003). In Table 3, all
the t-values exceeded 1.96 significant levels (statistically
significant at .05 levels), hence, all the measurements items
were significantly explaining the research construct. For dis-
criminant validity (see Table 4), the value of AVE was square
rooted and testified against the intercorrelations of the con-
struct with other constructs in the research model (Chin,
2010; Komiak & Benbasat, 2006) and all the values noted as
greater than each of the constructs correlations (Chin, 2010),
hence, the measurement model satisfactory achieved. In
order to testify the reliability of the variables, Cronbach's
alpha (see Table 5) was used to validate the reliability of the
variables and the minimum cut off point must above .70
(Cronbach, 1951). Thus, all the internal reliabilities of scales
were ranged from .786 to .876 which was clearly acceptable.
Hence, the measurement model was satisfactory and pro-
vided sufficient evidence in terms of reliability, convergent
validity, and discriminant validity.
Assessment of the Structural Model
Next, Figure 2 and Table 6 present the results of the hypoth-
eses testing. The results showed that SQ exists to be moder-
ating the relationship between MO and OP but negative
relationship between CO and IFC toward OP. However, CPO
positively related to OP. Two hypotheses were accepted,
namely, H2 and H4, whereas, H1 and H3 were rejected.
The researcher also conducted a global fit measure (GoF)
to examine the global validation of PLS model (Amato,
Esposito Vinzi, & Tenenhaus, 2004; Chin, 1998). The GoF
was calculated (see Equation 1), and results of .661 (R2 was
.612, average AVE was .714) exceeded the minimum large
value of .36 and indicated that the GoF value was large
enough to support the validation of PLS model globally
(Wetzels, Schroder, & Oppen, 2009). As seen, the model has
better explaining power in comparison with the baseline val-
ues (GoFsmall = .1, GoFmedium = .25, GoFlarge = .36;
Akter, D'Ambra, & Ray, 2011).

Discussion
Resource-based view theory (Barney, 1991; Drnevich &
Kriauciunas, 2011) highlighted that MO practice is essential
for the organization to gain additional resources for com-
petitive advantage and to be sustainable in the marketplace
(Rodrigues & Pinho, 2010). Besides, SQ is equally impor-
tant for an organization to achieve competitive advantage
(Au & Tse, 1995; Shekarchizadeh et al., 2011). This study
aims to examine the impact of MO practices on OP and the
Chin et al. 7
moderating factor of SQ in the relationship between MO
and OP.
Interestingly, the results have demonstrated that SQ influ-
enced the relationship between MO and OP such as FP and
MP. MO often relates to external practices of providing value
toward customers, and SQs are commonly used to influence
or enhance the market-oriented services in fulfilling custom-
ers' needs and wants (Lin, 2011). SQ is equally important
to OP, especially those of the service organizations
(C. Gronroos, 1998; Voon, 2005). The finding of this study
showed similar results from past researches in which SQ
positively affected MO and OP such as FP (Chang & Chen,
2004; Chao & Spillan, 2010; Shoham et al., 2005) and MP
(Camarero, 2007; Lin, 2011). The existence of SQ is vital to
fulfill customers' needs and wants (Lewis & Mitchell, 1990)
as SQ fills the gap between customers'expectations and their
perceptions with regard to the service providers' perfor-
mance (Carman, 1990; C. A. Gronroos, 1984). Hence, SQ
can influence MO practices that could lead to a better firm
performance such as FP.
In addition, past researchers (Gamage, Suwanabroma,
Ueyama, Hada, & Sekikawa, 2008; Reeves & Bednar, 1994)
had highlighted the importance of SQ to better serve their
customers by adopting the concept of MO to fulfill custom-
er's needs (Samat, Ramayah, & Mat Saad, 2006) and to
absorb competitors' strengths to gain competitive advantage
in the marketplace for better hotel's marketing and FP (Sin
et al., 2004). Apart from obtaining customer satisfaction, a
superior SQ would lead to customer loyalty (Heskett, 2002),
which would ultimately lead to improvements in a firm's
MP. Previous researches (Ahsan & Herath, 2006; Lainema &
Hilmola, 2006) showed that SQ has significant influence on
customers' purchase intention. As firms provide better SQ to
better serve their customers, this would increase the custom-
ers' purchase intention as well as attract more customers
through the positive word of mouth (WOM) generated by
satisfied customers. In the long term, this will create cus-
tomer loyalty, resulting in a larger base of customers who
prefer to purchase products and services from this organiza-
tion (Ahmadi & Bidarpoor, 2011). Providing good SQ would

not only increase customer satisfaction but will also result in
employee satisfaction (Lee, Chen, Chen, & Chen, 2010),
which leads to superior firm performance. For employees to
provide good quality of service to customers, the firm needs
to provide the appropriate training that will generate a good,
positive attitude that is equally important in service indus-
tries (Dennis, Chris, & Eli, 2005). In return, there will be an
increase in employee satisfaction, which leads to a better
implementation of IFC process and achievement of certain
objectives (Peng & George, 2011).
On the other hand, CPO was found to be significantly
related to OP such as FP and MP. This result is congruent
with the findings of past researchers (e.g., Kara, Spillan, &
DeShields, 2005; Salman & Zain, 2011), whereby competi-
tor-oriented organization is able to create competitive advan-
tage that leads to superior OP, specifically in hotel industry
(Sin, Tse, Heung, & Yim, 2005; Zhou et al., 2009). Firms that
successfully acquire competitor information are said to be
able to create differentiation and gain value for their com-
pany (Zhang & Edward, 2007), and in return for superior OP.
Thus, it is believed that competitor-oriented organizations
are able to generate certain advantages for a better firm
performance.
Surprisingly, the findings of this study showed that MO
such as CO and IFC has no positive impact on the OP. The
results are congruent with past studies whereby MO such as
CO and IFC has no positive impact on the financial aspect of
OP (Khamwon & Speece, 2005; Hult, Ketchen, & Slater,
2005; Langerak, Hultink, & Robben, 2000, 2004) and MP
(Piercy, Harris, & Lane, 2002; Qu & Ennew, 2006; Susan,
2009). Thus, it is believed that there exist some barriers to
MO practices on management behavior such as poor top
management skills (Tomaskova, 2009) and lack of compen-
sation and reward system (Hashim, 2011; Islam & Ismail,
2008) being in place, which point to the contrast in the find-
ings of the study. Nonetheless, some of the researchers even
highlighted that failure of MO practices is highly due to cul-
tural differences (Anantatmula & Kanungo, 2010), lack of
commitment (Trueman, 2004), and interdepartmental con-
flict (Kirca et al., 2005).
In short, the findings have noted that SQ is essentially
important in determining the success of MO practices that

lead to better OP. In contrast, the results revealed that there
was no direct relationship between MO dimensions such as
CO and IFC toward OP. However, CPO was found to be sig-
nificantly related to OP. Hence, the results have provided
evidence of SQ as an important key indicator in linking the
relationship between MO and OP.
Implications
The present research has a number of theoretical and practi-
cal implications for scholars and practitioners. First, this
study represented the theoretical study about MO, OP, and
impact of SQ on hotel industry. In the past, there were lim-
ited studies on SQ in moderating the relationship between
MO and OP. The present research offers a foundation for
researchers who are concerned in this field to further investi-
gate the use of SQ as a moderator in other industries. Second,
this study is also believed to be able to provide useful guide-
lines for scholars in the study of SQ as a moderator in the
relationship between MO and OP.
Certainly, the finding of this study can provide valuable
information to hotel managers by adopting a more system-
atized view of their SQ, MO practices, and future develop-
ment. Knowledge from this study can provide managers with
an enhanced ability to design their services much more effi-
ciently and can be used to shape their organizational opera-
tional strategy to create competitive advantage (C. A.
Gronroos, 2007) and gain superior return. Besides, this study
also increases managers' understanding of the importance of
MO practices and SQ orientation.At the organizational level,
top management should always emphasize and provide train-
ing to employees to ensure that employees always put their
customer first and satisfy customers' needs in the most
appropriate and efficient way. This is to ensure greater under-
standing among all employees and work together to achieve
superior performance. This finding has suggested that SQ be
incorporated as a tool to evaluate MO in the hotel industry.
Hence, this can be used in determining the service firm's
marketing strategy in achieving better performance.
Limitations and Direction for Future Research
There are some restrictions and limitations during the devel-
opment and implementation of this study as with any other
study. First, this study was cross-sectional in which the data
were collected in a limited time frame and this only offered a
static perspective on fit. Second, vast numbers of respon-
dents from middle and low level of management participated
in this study. The participation from the top level of manage-
ment may provide more accurate results for this study.
