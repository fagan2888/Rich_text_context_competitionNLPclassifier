Abstract
Background: Whether lying-flat improves blood flow in patients with acute ischemic stroke is unknown. Our aim was
to investigate if lying-flat ``changes'' cerebral blood flow velocities assessed by transcranial Doppler in acute ischemic
stroke patients.
Methods: In a multicenter cluster clinical trial, we randomly assigned patients within 12 h from onset of a neurological
deficit due to cerebral ischemia of the anterior circulation to lying-flat or upright head positioning. The primary outcome
was a change of 8 cm/s or more in mean cerebral blood flow velocities on transcranial Doppler to the middle cerebral
artery at 1 and 24 h post-randomization, adjusted for imbalance in baseline variables. Secondary outcomes included
serious adverse events and physical functioning at 90 days.
Results: Ninety-four of 304 patients screened were recruited. The primary outcome occurred in 11 (26%) of 43
patients in the lying-flat group and in 6 (12%) of 51 in the upright group at 1 h (adjusted odds ratio, 3.81; 95% CI,
1.07 to 13.54), and in 23 (53%) and 18 (36%) patients in these respective groups at 24 h (adjusted odds ratio, 3.04; 95%
CI, 1.08 to 8.53). There were no between-group differences in serious adverse events, including pneumonia, heart failure
or mortality, nor in functional outcome at 3 months (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI 0.64 to 3.00).
Conclusion: The lying-flat head position was associated with a significant increase in cerebral blood flow velocities at
one and 24 h within the ipsilateral hemisphere of anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke, without serious safety
concerns.

Introduction
Reperfusion therapy, medical with a lytic agent or
mechanical clot retrieval, is the only proven treatment
for acute ischemic stroke, but the approach is expensive
and poorly accessed by the majority of patients in the
world. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological
blood pressure (BP) augmentation therapies are pro-
mising new treatments for acute ischemic stroke
(AIS), which aim to improve cerebral blood flow to
the ischemic penumbra through mechanisms that
involve recruitment of collateral and leptomeningeal
vessels.1­4 A simple approach to increasing cerebral
blood flow might be through tilting the head of patients
with AIS into a ``lying-flat'' (0) head position as
opposed to the standard sitting-up (30) nursing care
that is used in many centers and countries, as recom-
mended in clinical guidelines.5­8 Several observational
studies suggest that lying-flat improves cerebral blood
flow velocity (CBFV) as measured by transcranial
Doppler (TCD),9 but these data are not conclusive10
and there is variability among clinicians over the best
strategy regarding head positioning in AIS.11 The aim
of this study was to determine whether the lying-flat
head position within 12 h of symptom onset, as com-
pared to upright head position, improves CBFV on
TCD to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in patients
with anterior cerebral circulation AIS.
Methods
Study design
This was an open, prospective, multicenter, inter-
national, cluster randomized, ``proof of concept''
phase IIb controlled trial, with masked outcome assess-
ment. Three centers from two countries participated.
All received local ethics approval. The full study proto-
col has been published in detail previously.12
Eligibility
Inclusion criteria were age !18 years, have a clinical
diagnosis of anterior circulation AIS by brain imaging
that excluded hemorrhage or other cause of neuro-
logical symptoms, could be safely positioned either
lying-flat (0) or upright (30) position before 12 h
from symptom onset, have some degree of neurological
impairment defined by a National Institutes of Health
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score !1 upon admission to hos-
pital, uncertainty of the balance of benefits and harms
of different head positioning within the first 24 h of
admission, and written informed consent obtained.
Exclusion criteria were having any contraindication to
the lying-flat head position (e.g. active vomiting,
pneumonia, uncontrolled heart failure), have a low
potential for benefit from either change in head pos-
ition, have a high probability of death within the next
48 h, have a concomitant medical illness that would
interfere with the outcome assessments and/or follow-
up, have decompressive craniectomy, carotid endarter-
ectomy or other early planned surgical procedure, and
absence of appropriate sonographic temporal bone
window for TCD.
Randomization and blinding
All eligible patients admitted during a given month
were randomly assigned to either lying-flat (interven-
tion) or upright (control) head position. Thus, clusters
were months, not centers, which allowed stroke care
teams to follow a monthly protocol without the need
for frequent changing of position for individual
patients. Randomization of head position by month
was generated using the online program QuickCalcs,13
balanced by center, and managed by the principal
investigator (VO) who had no involvement in TCD or
follow-up of patients; this permitted appropriate balan-
cing of the intervention among clusters and centers.
TCD results were assessed centrally by masked experi-
enced neurosonologists. Adjudication of serious
adverse events (SAEs) and endpoints were performed
centrally masking the intervention and following
detailed criteria. The 90-day assessment of modified
Rankin Scale (mRS) was conducted locally by trained
staff masked to the intervention and other clinical
information.
Procedures
Interventions were two nursing stroke care protocols:
(a) lying-flat head position or (b) upright head position.
In (a), patients were positioned to 0 as soon as possible
after the diagnosis of AIS was made by brain imaging,
and this position is then maintained for the next 24 h.
Side-lying was recommended for prevention of aspir-
ation. From 24 to 48 h, patients were allowed to have
their head raised slowly (to a maximum of 15) and to
ensure they did not have any alteration in their neuro-
logical condition (i.e. avoidance of a decline in Glasgow
coma scale (GCS) scores of >1 point or an increase in
NIHSS score of >4 points). After 48 h, patients may
have had their head elevated further to the standard 30
or more. In (b), patients were positioned with their
head up to 30 or more as soon as possible after the
diagnosis of AIS was confirmed on brain imaging and
maintained this position for at least the next 48 h. If
there was a clear neurological deterioration, defined
by a decline in GCS scores of 1 point or an increase
in NIHSS of >4 points, the patient's position could be

changed. In all patients, checks of their position were
made hourly during 48 h after the intervention. All par-
ticipants were managed by a dedicated stroke team in
an acute stroke unit, high dependency or intensive care
unit. Brain imaging (computerized tomography and/or
magnetic resonance imaging, and TCD) was conducted
according to standardized techniques at baseline and at
later stages, according to local protocols. The following
information was collected on admission: medical
history, medications at time of admission, BP, heart
rate (HR), and scores on the GCS and NIHSS, brain
imaging findings to rule out hemorrhagic, mean CBFV
and pulsatility indexes (pin) by baseline TCD on both
MCA with the patient in 30, according to a standard
protocol. Additionally, data were collected on arterial
obstruction/occlusion and presence of collaterals on the
baseline TCD, as well as aspects of AIS management,
including use of thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy
and routine laboratory tests. Patients were assessed
during the first 48 h with the primary goal of ensuring
adherence to the allocated head position. Accordingly,
head positions were recorded hourly for the first 48 h. If
the patient's position was changed (e.g. for rehabilita-
tion or visit to the bathroom), the reason(s) and time
spent off position were recorded. The following infor-
mation was collected: mean CBFV and pin on both
MCA by TCD at 1 (Æ30 min) and 24 h (Æ4 h); BP,
GCS, and NIHSS scores at 24 h; and dysphagia
screening test according to local protocols. NIHSS
scores, dependency assessed with the mRS, diagnosis
of pneumonia or heart failure (if occurred), and the
date of discharge from hospital (if this had occurred
on or prior to day 7, or day of discharge/transfer to
another hospital, if earlier). On 90 Æ 7 days, all surviv-
ing patients were evaluated, either through in-person or
telephone interview, where the following information
was recorded: dependency assessed with the mRS, use
of secondary prevention medications, and the occur-
rence of any SAE.14 For patients who had died prior
to any of the above scheduled assessments, the time and
documented cause of death were collected. All SAEs
were recorded and additional details were requested
for any supplementary information related to an SAE
and its outcome.
TCD insonation protocol
Three hand-held TCD examinations were performed by
experienced neurosonologists, initially at baseline
(TCD-0) immediately after the diagnosis was made,
with the participant positioned at 30 sitting-up, using
a standard diagnostic protocol (details of the insona-
tion protocol is outlined in the Supplementary
Appendix).15,16 Transtemporal TCD was repeated at
60 Æ 30 min (TCD-1) and at 24 Æ 4 h (TCD-2) after
allocation to the randomized head position. For TCD
1 and 2, measurements of the mean CBFV and pin were
obtained on the M1 segment of each MCA at a depth
of 50­60 mm, at the same time as measurements of BP
and HR. Ultrasonography results were adjudicated
centrally by two other experienced neurosonologists
(AB and PMV) who were masked to the intervention.
Outcomes
The main outcome was significant change in the mean
CBFV in the ipsilateral side of the AIS, as assessed by
TCD to the MCA at 1 and 24 h after head positioning.
Secondary outcomes were neurological status accord-
ing to a shift in scores on the NIHSS at 7 days (or
discharge if earlier), and functioning according to an
ordinal shift in the distribution of scores on the mRS
at 90 days. Safety outcomes were the proportion of
SAEs, including of pre-specific episodes of pneumonia
and congestive cardiac failure in the first 7 days, and
any intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or death by 90
days. Feasibility of the intervention was defined as the
proportion of patients who were able to maintain the
position for !24 h. Adjudication of SAEs was per-
formed centrally by clinicians who were blind to the
randomized intervention.
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 23 group clusters for each intervention
(total 46 clusters; each with an average of 2 patients),
assuming an intracluster correlation index of 0.037, was
estimated to provide 90% power with a 5% level of
significance to detect a clinically significant increase in
CBFV (mean difference 8.3 [11.4] cm/s) between the
lying-flat and upright groups.9 All analyses were per-
formed at the patient and cluster levels according to the
intention-to-treat principle. The primary analysis com-
pared the proportion of patients with a mean CBFV
``change'' of !8 cm/s in the ipsilateral side at 1 h and
at 24 h after positioning. We used 8 cm/s as the cut-off
point, based on the results of our previous systematic
review and meta-analysis quantifying the effect of head
position on CBFV measured with TCD in patients with
AIS. In this review, which included 57 patients from
four prospective observational studies, we found that
patients positioned lying-flat (0) had a mean increase
of 8.31 cm/s (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.34­11.28)
compared to CBFV in those in the upright position
(30)9. All analyses were adjusted for the following vari-
ables: baseline CBFV, age, NIHSS, use of thrombolysis
(or mechanical thrombectomy), and site of vessel
occlusion and presence of collateral flow identified on
TCD. A per-protocol analysis was also conducted.
Safety outcomes were analyzed without adjustment.

All analyses were performed using random effect mixed
models. Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary
outcome included an interaction test to determine
whether the effect of treatment differed significantly
across categories for each subgroup, expressed as a p
value for heterogeneity. The following pre-specified
subgroups were age < or !65 years; NIHSS scores
<10 or !10, <7 or !7, and below and above the overall
median; time from symptom onset to positioning of <6
versus !6 h; baseline systolic BP below and above the
overall mean; use of intravenous thrombolysis (or
mechanical thrombectomy); evidence of vessel occlu-
sion of collateral blood flow on TCD; and the time in
randomized head position of < or ! 24 h. The same
analyses for change in CBFV and across pre-specified
subgroups were performed for the contralateral side of
the AIS. A post hoc multivariate analysis adding atrial
fibrillation and congestive heart failure was performed.
Data are reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI.
Conventional two-sided levels of statistical significance
(a ¼ 0.05) were used. All analyses were undertaken
using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). More
details of the statistical analysis have been previously
published.17
Results
From 1 January 2013 through 31 July 2015, 94 patients
of 304 screened were recruited from three centers in two
countries (Figure 1), 43 allocated to the lying-flat and
51 to upright head positions. There were no significant
differences in baseline and clinical characteristics

between the groups, except for those in the upright pos-
ition having more congestive cardiac failure, atrial fib-
rillation, and occlusions of the terminal carotid and
those lying-flat having more MCA M1 segment occlu-
sions (Table 1). The mean (ÆSD) age of participants
was 72 (14) years and 28 (29.8%) were female; the
median (IQR) NIHSS was 6 (3­12) points.
There were similar times to the commencement and
duration of head positioning between groups: lying-flat,
mean 5.5 (3.3) from symptom onset and median 45
(IQR 40 to 45) h duration; upright, 5.0 (2.8) h from
symptom onset and median 44 (IQR 40 to 44) h
duration. Forty-one patients (95%) and 50 (98%)
maintained the allocated head position !24 h in the
lying-flat and upright positions, respectively (p ¼ 0.46).
Baseline CBFV and BP were similar between the
groups (Table 1 and Figure S1). There were no signifi-
cant differences in the management between groups in
hospital over the first seven days, except for there being
more use of antihypertensive drugs in those in the
upright group (Table 1).
In adjusted analysis of the primary outcome, a mean
change in CBFV of >8 cm/s in the ipsilateral side
occurred in 11 patients (26%) allocated to the lying-
flat head position and in six patients (12%) allocated
to the upright head position at 1 h (OR 3.81, 95% CI
1.07 to 13.54; p ¼ 0.04). At 24 h, the primary outcome
occurred 23 patients (53%) in the lying-flat position
and 18 patients (36%) in the upright head position
(OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.08 to 8.53; p ¼ 0.04). Overall
adjusted mean difference in CBFV between groups
was 6 cm/s (range 1.87­10.14; p ¼ 0.005) at 1 h and
10.34 cm/s (À1.7 to 22.38; p ¼ 0.09) at 24 h (Table 2,
Figure S2). Relative mean difference in CBFV in the
ipsilateral side was 19.1% (95% CI 10.1 to 28.6;
p < 0.001) at 1 h in the lying-flat compared to the
upright head positions, and 26.1% (95% CI 11.5 to
44.0; p ¼ 0.002) at 24 h (Table 2). Similar effects were
evident in the per-protocol analysis (Table S1). In a
post hoc multivariate analysis, which included variables
that could have produce selection bias due to orthop-
nea (CHF and AF) the results did not change (Table
S2). Pin increased significantly at 1 and 24 h in patients
lying-flat in the contralateral side but not in the ipsilat-
eral side, in the intention to treat population (Table S3).
There were no significant between-group differences
in an ordinal analyses of the NIHSS at 7 days (Figure
S2) and mRS at 90 days (adjusted common OR 1.38,
95% CI 0.64 to 3.0; p ¼ 0.42) (Figure 2).
There were no differences in the 90-day mortality
between groups: four (9%) patients in the lying-flat
and three (6%) in the upright positions (adjusted OR
5.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 50.2; p ¼ 0.12). There was no sig-
nificant difference in occurrence of SAEs, including
pneumonia and congestive cardiac failure between

including death or disability (mRS scores 3 to 6),
early neurological deterioration, length of hospitaliza-
tion, or ``change'' in CBFV in the contralateral side
(Table S5).
Discussion
This cluster clinical trial has shown that the lying-flat
head position within 12h of symptom onset produced a
significant large increase in CBFV as compared to the
upright head position, in patients with mild/moderate
AIS stroke involving the anterior circulation. These
effects occurred within 1 h of lying-flat but attenuated
by 24h, in part from a late increase in CBFV in patients
who adopted the upright position, as determined by serial
TCD. Lying-flat was not associated with an increase in
SAEs, although this position did produce some increase
in back pain/discomfort in patients. The change in
CBFV, however, did not translate into improved clinical
outcomes for those in the lying-flat position at 7 or 90
days but the study was not powered for this purpose.
Our results confirm findings from previous observa-
tional non-randomized studies of there being an
increase in CBFV in the ipsilateral but not contralateral
side, from lying-flat in patients with AIS involving the
territory of the MCA.9,10
One potential mechanism for the effect is gravita-
tional force acting on passively dilated vessels to
increase pressure gradients and residual blood flow in
the ischemic brain, which is supported by the lack of
change in pin in the ipsilateral side and increase in the
contralateral side in patients lying-flat. Other explan-
ations include improved collateral circulation to the
ischemic penumbra region and passive vasodilatation
of distal vessels from local perfusion pressure gradi-
ents.18­20 The absence of any increase in CBFV on
the contralateral side of cerebral infarction might
relate to there being greater impairment of vasomotor
reactivity in the region of ischemia/infarction.
There were low rates of aspiration pneumonia in our
study, which may relate to the careful assessment and
management of participants, including the use dyspha-
gia screening protocols and appropriate feeding
regimes, as well as the exclusion of high-risk patients
such as those requiring intubation. However, similar
low rates of pneumonia were recently reported in a
retrospective study of consecutive unselected patients
who were positioned in lying-flat after AIS.21
A key strength of this study was the use of cluster
randomization to reduce potential contamination of the
intervention between groups and improve fidelity of the
protocol among clinical staff caring for patients.
Another important strength of this study is the short
time from symptom onset to commencement of pos-
itioning, which is in line with the proposed mechanism
by which this intervention could have a clinically sig-
nificant benefit, that of increasing cerebral blood flow
to penumbral tissue. Other features were the blinded
evaluation of CBFV and clinical outcomes, and the
high agreement among neurosonologists performing
TCD.22
There are some limitations; however, in that most
participants were from a single center and there were
imbalances in some of the baseline clinical characteris-
tics related the overall small sample size. These aspects
may have introduced bias, although the results were
consistent in post hoc adjusted analyses. Moreover,
being a phase IIb clinical trial, these results may not
apply to a broader range of patients, including those
with posterior circulation or mild AIS, or with position-
ing introduced after 12 h from symptom onset.
In summary, this cluster clinical trial of patients with
anterior circulation AIS, showed that the lying-flat head
position within 12 h of symptom onset caused a signifi-
cant increase in CBFV in the ipsilateral side of the lesion,
without any serious safety concerns. Whether such head
positioning translates into any clinical benefit within
24 h of symptom onset in patients with stroke is being
assessed in the phase 3 HeadPoST main study.23
