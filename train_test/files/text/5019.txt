I'm just dumb. I had no doubts about that statement,
and everybody else knew it too. Although no one spe-
cifically said anything to me about my being Black, I
think my poor record reinforced my general impres-
sion that Black kids just were not as smart as White
ones. I shrugged, accepting the reality--that's just the
way things were supposed to be. . . . I could easily
have decided that life was cruel, that being Black
meant everything was stacked against me. And I might
have gone that way except for two things that hap-
pened during fifth grade to change my perception of
the whole world. (Carson & Murphey, 1990, pp.
29-31)
It is almost impossible to conceive that these were the initial
internalized beliefs of a 10-year-old child who would grow up
to receive a full scholarship from Yale University, graduate
from the University of Michigan School of Medicine, become
the director of pediatric neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins
University at the age of 32, and receive the Presidential Medal
of Freedom Award in 2008 (Carson & Murphey, 1990).
Dr. Carson's autobiographical memory, described above,
illustrates that for a period in his childhood, he believed in
society's master narrative of race and intelligence that casts
Black children as being less smart than White children. Two
critical life events in the fifth grade, however, led to a radical
shift in the way he viewed his intelligence and his social
environment. These experiences served as the catalyst in
preventing his maladaptive thoughts from becoming a destiny
hampered by limitations. As a result, Dr. Benjamin Carson
was able to conquer his beliefs of the intellectual inferiority
of Black students. Dr. Carson's narrative provides a clear
example of one of the ways in whichAfricanAmericans'con-
ceptions of intelligence may be shaped by the psychological
significance of the meaning of race. What is less clear from
Carson's narrative is whether he viewed his own intelligence
as an innate entity that is fixed or as one that is malleable and
can be altered by effort.
The concept of implicit intelligence that is examined in
this study refers to a person's beliefs about the nature of
intelligence. These beliefs can range from fixed to malleable.
Individuals with the fixed or "entity" view of intelligence
place the primary focus on their ability. They believe their
intelligence is innate, with little opportunity for change.
Conversely, individuals with the malleable or "incremental"

The Cultural Historical Complexity of
Human Personality Adaptation:What is the
Nature of African American Adolescents'
ImplicitTheories of Intelligence?
Melissa E.Wynn1, Cynthia E.Winston1,2, and Kimberley E. Freeman2
Abstract
Research on implicit intelligence has conceptualized students' beliefs about the nature of intelligence as either fixed or
malleable.This research has largely not included African American adolescents, a group for whom beliefs about intelligence
have a cultural historical complexity related to both scientific racism and master narratives of race and intelligence. The
purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of implicit theories of intelligence for 63 African American adolescents
who are seventh and eighth graders in a public charter school.The two-way ANOVA revealed that these adolescents held
a malleable view of intelligence, which did not vary by gender or grade. Exploratory correlation analysis showed some
consistent relationships with achievement motivation variables found in other studies.These findings may be explained by
AfricanAmerican cultural values and the personality characteristic adaptations that they make living within a racialized society.

view of intelligence believe that intelligence can be devel-
oped and that increasing their effort can boost their intelli-
gence (Dweck, 2000, 2006; Dweck & Leggett, 1988). This
belief system has contextual specificity as a result of an
individual's cognitive processing of information from life
experiences within his or her social environment (Dweck,
2000). In previous studies, implicit intelligence theory has
been used to explain why students adopt different types of
achievement goals that produce related patterns of achieve-
ment behavior (Dweck, 2000; Dweck & Molden, 2005).
To date, there has been a paucity of implicit intelligence
studies that have investigated the beliefs of non-White
American racial groups (Aronson, Fried, & Good, 2002;
Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007; Quihuis,
Bempechat, Jimenez, & Boulay, 2002). Furthermore, the
research that has been conducted with predominately African
American and Hispanic samples is too small to draw mean-
ingful generalizations. These studies do allow, however, some
theoretical propositions to be explored in the present study.
Quihuis et al. (2002) applied a mixed-method approach
to the examination of the implicit theories of intelligence for
a group of Mexican American adolescents. The survey
findings revealed that these high school students adopted
domain-specific (e.g., math, science) implicit views of intel-
ligence, while the qualitative interviews suggested that they
concurrently held characteristics of both views. Similar to
the Mexican American students in this study, the views of
African Americans and other students of color may be influ-
enced by cultural values that reflect their racialized experi-
ences within American culture as a result of having to
negotiate society's master narratives of race and intellectual
capacity that have evolved over time (see Winston &
Winston, 2012).
The studies that have been conducted with African
Americans did not seek to examine the nature of these stu-
dents' implicit intelligence theories. Instead, they focused
on manipulating the participants' views of intelligence to
promote malleability. The only experimental study that uti-
lized a predominately African American adolescent sample
was conducted by Blackwell et al. (2007). In this study, the
incremental theory of intelligence was taught to a group of
seventh graders over an 8-week period. This intervention
resulted in students' increased mathematics achievement
and classroom motivation. One of the limitations of this
study was that the data were not disaggregated by race, and
therefore, the specific nature of implicit theories of intelli-
gence for African American adolescents is still unknown.
Another experiment by Aronson et al. (2002) was conducted
with an equivalent number of African American and
Caucasian college students and investigated the impact that
promoting an incremental view of intelligence would have
in reducing stereotype threat and, subsequently, increasing
academic performance. The short-term effects of the manip-
ulation showed that the African American students' experi-
enced increased academic performance and more strongly
embraced the incremental view of intelligence over time.
There are several reasons why understanding the nature
of implicit intelligence theories of African American adoles-
cents is important. First, during the middle school transition,
there is a well-documented drop in students'grades, achieve-
ment motivation, and overall psychological well-being
(Eccles & Midgley, 1989; Good, Aronson, & Inzlicht,
2003). In addition to the change in academic environment,
adolescents are adapting to the numerous biological changes
that occur during puberty, cognitive shifts associated with
an increased capacity for abstract thinking, and increasingly
complex relationships with peers, parents, and teachers
(Wigfield & Wagner, 2005).
Given the link between implicit theories of intelligence
and achievement motivation found in previous studies
(Dweck, 2000, 2002; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Dweck &
Molden, 2005), it is important to examine the nature of
African American students' implicit theories of intelligence
and their relation to adaptive patterns of achievement moti-
vation during this critical developmental period. Research
on implicit theories of intelligence has shown that students'
theories about intelligence are related to their achievement
motivation and academic performance (Dweck, 2000). For
example, a malleable view of intelligence has been found to
be positively related to mastery goals, but negatively associ-
ated with both performance-approach and performance-
avoidance goals (Fonseca, Cury, Bailly, & Rufo, 2004).
An additional reason why studying the implicit theories
of intelligence among African American adolescents is
important is that there is very little research that focuses on
African Americans and intelligence (see Cokley, Caldwell,
Miller, & Muhammad, 2001). Furthermore, that which does
exist focuses almost exclusively on intelligence testing
(see Butler-Omololu, Doster, & Lahey, 1983; Graves &
Mitchell, 2011; Grubb, 1987; Hilliard, 1994; Kwate, 2001;
Price & Cutler, 2001; Schiele, 1991) despite the growing
awareness among scholars (Dweck, 2000, 2002; Dweck &
Leggett, 1988; Dweck & Molden, 2005) about the impor-
tance of students' beliefs about intelligence in shaping their
achievement motivation and success.
Finally, examining African American adolescents'
personal beliefs about intelligence is both interesting and
important due to the cultural historical debates, symbols, and
stereotyped expectations in American society about race and
the intellectual capacity of African Americans (see Winston
& Winston, 2012). For example, Robert Bennett Bean
(1906), a professor of anatomy at the University of Virginia
Medical School, asserted that the "Negro brain" developed
normally as far as perception, memory, and motor responses
were concerned, but logical critical thinking or the compre-
hension of abstract ideas were beyond its grasp because of
"arrested physiological development" (pp. 353-354). Almost
60 years later, Arthur Jensen's (1969) popular article, "How
Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?"
argued that genetic factors are more meaningful than envi-
ronmental factors in assessing IQ differences. More recently,
Herrnstein and Murray's (1994) book, The Bell Curve:
Wynn et al. 3
Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life, continued
this line of ideology, arguing that there were intellectual dif-
ferences across racial groups that resulted from the innate
genetic inferiority of Blacks and superiority of Whites.
This type of racist ideology is deeply entrenched in soci-
ety's master narratives of race and intelligence on the
one hand, but on the other hand, it is resisted and countered
in Black culturally responsive contexts (Burrell, Winston,
& Freeman, in press). Given that African American adoles-
cents' beliefs about intelligence develop in multiple racial-
ized societal contexts, their psychological development is
particularly complex. In sum, these dual contexts serve to
socialize African American adolescents' beliefs about the
general nature of intelligence. Schunk (1991) has empha-
sized the importance of context in shaping students' beliefs
about their ability and competence. Social contexts may
likely influence students' development of more specific
beliefs about intelligence as either malleable or fixed.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of
implicit theories of intelligence held by African American
adolescents. The study also examined within-group varia-
tions in the nature of these beliefs, as well as explored other
achievement motivation correlates that have been found to
be related to implicit theories of intelligence in other studies
(Aronson et al., 2002; Blackwell et al., 2007; Dweck, 2000;
Henderson & Dweck, 1990). The primary research question
addressed in this study was as follows:
What is the nature of African American adolescents'
implicit theories of intelligence?
Theoretical Framework
The theoretical framework for the present study is grounded
in several tenets of implicit intelligence theory. At its core,
implicit intelligence theory describes individual's beliefs
about intelligence as ranging between being fixed, innate,
static, trait-like, and relatively unchanging (the "entity"
view) or being malleable, dynamic, and developable
(the "incremental" view) such that an increase in effort can
promote intellectual growth (Dweck, 2000, 2006; Dweck
& Leggett, 1988).
One central tenet of implicit intelligence theory that is
directly explored in this study is that there is a relationship
between malleable views of intelligence and achievement
motivation. During adolescence, the transition from the more
mastery-oriented learning style taught in elementary school
to the more performance goal orientation that is promoted in
middle school has been found to be quite challenging for stu-
dents with an entity view of intelligence (Dweck, 2002).
Students with a malleable view of intelligence have more
adaptive achievement motivation, and challenges are viewed
as an opportunity for growth. Furthermore, setbacks are not
internalized as failures by students with a malleable view of
intelligence. Since the focused goal is on mastering the
information, there is not a concern about looking either
"smart" or "dumb" to others.
During middle school, students who view their intelli-
gence as being fixed feel that their intelligence is threatened
when they are faced with tasks that confront their professed
abilities and demonstrated success from elementary school
(Dweck, 2000). This opposition to their preconceived belief
system can lead to a decrease in self-esteem, motivation,
and the development of maladaptive behaviors such as task
avoidance, self-handicapping, and classroom disengage-
ment. Dweck (2000, 2006) asserts that sending messages
of praise to young children when they succeed at tasks
(especially simple ones) can promote an entity view of intel-
ligence and produce maladaptive effects at later stages in
their development. The present study adopted the theoreti-
cal view that the more malleable African American students'
views of intelligence, the more adaptive their achievement
motivation.
A second tenet of implicit intelligence theory is that there
is an intersection of individuals' beliefs and the classroom
setting. According to Blackwell et al. (2007), "children's
beliefs become the mental `baggage' that they bring to the
achievement situation" (p. 259). Unlike entity theorists,
persons holding an incremental view of intelligence are less
inclined to form judgments about the intelligence of others
based solely on their successes or failures; however, they are
more likely to apply their belief in change potential to other
individuals (Dweck, 2000). This can be very critical to aca-
demic achievement in a classroom setting when the teacher
holds an incremental view of intelligence and applies this
belief to the student. Dweck (2006) cites a personal example
of the detriment of having a sixth-grade teacher who
believed that people's IQ scores told the whole story
of who they were . . . we were seated around the room
in IQ order . . . she was creating a mindset in which
everyone in the class had one consuming goal--look
smart, don't look dumb. (p. 6)
In the present study, the theoretical view is adopted that
African American students whose learning is socialized
within a classroom setting and school context that empha-
sizes Black cultural values and beliefs will adopt a more
incremental view of intelligence. That is, this view of intel-
ligence is consistent with the African American cultural
value of persistence and adopting a strong work ethic to
achieve success. Previous research supports this view of
the importance of culture as shaping views of intelligence
and has found that cultural values of Mexican Americans
and Koreans influence these students' implicit intelligence
theories (Quihuis et al., 2002; Woong, Plucker, & Im,
2002).

The Present Study
In sum, the present study investigates the nature of African
American adolescents' implicit intelligence theories. As
with prior work, we adopt the perspective that these beliefs
are particularly important to examine during middle school
because of the myriad of psychological changes within the
individual and the transitional characteristics of students'
learning environments. In addition, this study aims to
explore the psychological correlates of these adolescents'
implicit intelligence theories as a mechanism to gain more
insight into the nature of these beliefs.
This is the first study of implicit intelligence to argue
that it is important to examine the nature of implicit intel-
ligence in African American adolescents, because
their intelligence beliefs develop in a racialized social and
cultural environment. Furthermore, it is within this social
environment that master narratives of race and intelligence
have been pervasive. Although this study does not examine
race meaning directly, it does extend knowledge about the
nature of intelligence for African American adolescents.
This is a group for whom master narratives of race and
intelligence, as inaccurate as they may be (see Winston &
Winston, 2012), can inform the psychological negotiation
that the individual must engage in when trying to develop
implicit intelligence beliefs.
Method
Participants
The participants in this study are part of a larger mixed-
methods study examining the role of students' achievement
motivation, identity, social relationships, and perceptions of
school culture in mathematics and science success. The
participants included 63 African American seventh and
eighth grade students enrolled in an urban, predominately
African American, public charter middle school with
an academic curriculum that is focused on science and
mathematics. The school is located in the Mid-Atlantic
region of the United States. In all, 51% of the participants
are female, with 48% of the sample in the seventh grade and
52% in the eighth grade.
Measures
The Middle School Experiences (ME) Survey (Freeman,
Winston, & Wynn, 2007) was administered to the partici-
pants. This survey included several well-established scales
measuring achievement motivation, identity, perceptions of
school culture, and social relationships. Dweck's (2000)
Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale for Children­Self
Form (For Age 10 and Older) was used in its entirety in this
study as a measurement of implicit intelligence views. This
is a six-item scale with a 6-point Likert-type response scale
ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 6 (strongly disagree). A
sample item is, "You can learn new things, but you can't
really change your basic intelligence" (see Appendix A). The
scale provided a mix of entity and incremental response
questions and the three entity items were reverse-coded for
analysis, thus higher scores indicate more malleable views
of intelligence. The reliability for this scale was .81.
The achievement motivation variables were measured
using the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS)
developed by Midgley et al. (2000). This study examined
correlations between implicit intelligence beliefs and per-
sonal achievement goals, classroom goal structures, and
achievement beliefs and strategies. Personal Achievement
Goal Orientations comprised four scales (task goal orienta-
tion, ability/approach goal orientation, ability/avoidance
goal orientation, and extrinsic goal orientation) for both
mathematics and science domains. Achievement goals are
the reason students engage in particular academic behaviors
and tasks. Different types of achievement goals elicit differ-
ent response patterns.
Students oriented toward task goals are focused on mas-
tering the information and aim to develop their competence
and understanding in a subject area. These four items
comprised a 5-point Likert-type response scale ranging
from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample item is,
"An important reason I do my math work is because I like to
learn new things." The reliability for this scale was .83 for
the mathematics domain and .86 for the science domain.
An ability/approach goal orientation involves engaging in
schoolwork to display competence. These five items had a
5-point Likert-type response scale ranging from 1 (not at all
true) to 5 (very true). A sample item is, "I would feel
successful in science if I did better than most of the other
students in the class." The reliability for this scale was .79
for the mathematics domain and .83 for the science domain.
An ability/avoidance goal orientation is focused on
performance and trying to avoid looking incompetent.
Research has found this type of goal orientation to be pri-
marily associated with maladaptive learning patterns. These
six items comprised a 5-point Likert-type response scale
ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample
item is, "An important reason I do my math work is so that
I won't embarrass myself." The reliability for this scale
was .84 for the mathematics domain and .81 for the science
domain.
Extrinsic goal orientation focuses on students' engage-
ment in schoolwork for the purpose of obtaining an outcome
or reward such as a good grade, passing a test or promotion
to the next grade level. These four items had a 5-point Likert-
type response scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (very
true).Asample item is, "I do my work in science so that I can
pass the class." The reliability for this scale was .68 for the
mathematics domain and .69 for the science domain.
Perception of classroom goal structure refers to the
students' perceptions of the teacher's specific emphasis on
Wynn et al. 5
different types of achievement goal structures. These types
of goals were measured using three scales (task-focused,
ability-focused, and extrinsic focused). Task-focused goals
of the teacher place emphasis on developing competence
and mastery in a particular subject area. These five items
had a 5-point Likert-type response scale ranging from 1
(not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample item is, "My math
teacher thinks mistakes are ok as long as we are learning."
The reliability for this scale was .84 for the mathematics
domain and .87 for the science domain. Ability-focused
goals differ from task goals because the student perceives
the teacher to be focusing on the students demonstrating
their competence and outperforming others. These six items
had a 5-point Likert-type response scale ranging from 1
(not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample item is, "My
science teacher tells us how we compare to other students."
The reliability for this scale was .69 for the mathematics
domain and .72 for the science domain. Extrinsic classroom
goal structures of the teacher focus on students' engagement
in schoolwork for the purpose of obtaining an outcome
or reward such as a good grade, passing a test, or promotion
to the next grade level. These three items had a 5-point
Likert-type response scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to
5 (very true). A sample item is, "My math teacher tells us we
need to learn our math work because we will be tested on
it." The reliability for this scale was .65 for the mathematics
domain and .79 for the science domain.
Academic-related perceptions, beliefs, and strategies
refer to students' perceptions of their competence to do their
class work and specific learning strategies. These types
of constructs were measured using self-efficacy and self-
regulation scales. Self-efficacy refers to students' judgment
perception of their ability to perform well in their class work.
These seven items had a 5-point Likert-type response scale
ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample
item is, "I'm certain I can master the skills taught in
math this year." The reliability for this scale was .83 for the
mathematics domain and .80 for the science domain. Self-
regulation refers to students' control and direction of their
engagement in academic work. It includes behavioral
(rechecking work, designating study space) and cognitive
(monitoring understanding, concentrating) dimensions
(Pintrich & De Groot, 1990). These six items had a 5-point
Likert-type response scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to
5 (very true). A sample item is, "When I notice that I haven't
been listening to my science teacher, I try to concentrate
harder." The reliability for this scale was .76 for the mathe-
matics domain and .81 for the science domain.
Procedure
All students in the middle school were invited to participate
in the study via informational letters and consent forms that
were sent home to parents to explain the purpose of the
study and to request written consent for their children's par-
ticipation. The present study uses data collected in spring of
2009. Participants were administered the ME Survey
(Freeman et al., 2007) in groups, during their regular school
day. Survey administration took approximately 45 min. The
survey questions were read aloud to the participants by a
survey administrator while additional survey administrators
walked around the room to answer questions and to ensure
that the participants stayed on course with the reader. When
students completed the survey, the research team leader
debriefed them as a group and gave them a 10-dollar gift
card for participation in the study.
Data Analysis
As the initial step in the data analytic approach, a reliability
analysis was conducted to test the consistency of the items
in the implicit intelligence scale. Second, descriptive analy-
sis was utilized to describe the implicit intelligence beliefs
of the study sample. Third, a two-way between-groups
ANOVA was performed to determine whether there were
any significant statistical differences in implicit intelligence
by gender and grade level, and to also test whether there was
a significant interaction between gender and grade level on
implicit intelligence. Finally, an exploratory correlation
analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between
implicit theories of intelligence and achievement motivation
variables.
Results
The research question that guided this study was, "What is
the nature of African American adolescents' implicit theories
of intelligence?" On average, adolescents in this sample held
a malleable view of intelligence. As shown in Figure 1, an
item response analysis specifically revealed that no student in
the sample strongly disagreed with the belief that intelligence
is malleable. The descriptive analysis in Table 1 illustrates
that students' average implicit intelligence theory score
during the fall was 4.37 on a 6-point scale, with an increase
to a 4.60 in the spring. This malleable view also increased
slightly over the academic year by both gender and grade
level, with both girls and eighth graders possessing higher
levels of malleability. The ANOVA showed that these views
did not vary significantly by adolescents' gender or grade
level (see Tables 2 and 3), and there was not a significant
interaction between gender and grade level.
The nature of implicit theories of intelligence was also
examined in terms of their bivariate relationships with other
achievement motivation variables. As shown in Tables 4, 5
and 6, two achievement motivation variables were signifi-
cantly correlated with a malleable view of intelligence.
Students with more malleable views of intelligence were
more likely to have higher science efficacy beliefs than
6 SAGE Open
students with more fixed intelligence beliefs. In addition,
students who perceived an ability focus in their science
classrooms held less malleable views of intelligence than
students who perceived less of an ability focus in their
science classrooms.
Discussion
The goal of this study was to gain insight into the nature of
implicit theories of intelligence for African American
adolescents utilizing a sample of African American seventh
and eighth grade students from an urban public
charter middle school. In general, the implicit theories of
intelligence for African American adolescents in this study
were malleable for both boys and girls, as well as seventh
and eighth graders. Consistent with extant research and
theory, students with more malleable views of intelligence
were more likely to have other positive motivational
characteristics than students with more fixed views of intel-
ligence. The motivation patterns among this sample are
consistent with other research findings on the achievement
motivation of African Americans. For example, other
studies have found that a classroom ability focus can be
especially negative for African American youth (Gutman,
2006), and in this study, it was associated with more fixed
views of intelligence. In addition, high academic efficacy
beliefs have been suggested to be a cultural strength of
African Americans (Anderson, Freeman, & Winston, 2011;
Graham, 1994; Nicolas et al., 2008), and in the present
study, science efficacy beliefs were positively correlated
with malleable views of intelligence. Similar to the findings
with positive efficacy beliefs, we posit that malleable views
of intelligence are also a cultural strength of African
Americans given omnipresent negative master narratives
and stereotype threats.
We suggest two possible interpretations for why these
adolescents held more malleable views of intelligence. One
explanation is that these adolescents may adopt the theory
that intelligence is malleable because of their cultural values
and racial socialization. It is well established that the cultural
values of African Americans include a strong achievement
orientation, as well as endorsement of effort and hard work,
as a means of upward mobility (Bowman & Howard, 1985;
Hill, 1972; Hughes, 2003; Hughes et al., 2006; Nobles &
Goddard, 1984). These values, like other Afrocultural values
(see Tyler et al., 2008) have been generationally transmitted
from parent to child through the process of racial socializa-
tion. This may shape an adolescent's view of intelligence as
varying with hard work, thus translating into socialization
around education. In addition, the middle school is located
on the campus of a Historically Black University. This may
be why many of the parents chose to send their children to
the school, and it could be that these students' families pro-
mote cultural pride socialization.

A second possible interpretation of these adolescents'
malleable views of intelligence may result from their
immersion in a unique learning environment. The school
that these students attend has a specialized focus on sci-
ence and mathematics and a mission of academic excel-
lence that includes promotion of the intellectual, social,
and emotional growth of its predominately African
American student body. Matriculation in a school where
students are exposed daily to a principal, and staff and
teachers who are predominantly African American and in
an atmosphere where academic excellence is not only
encouraged but also expected provides a unique context
for learning and positive psychological development.
These experiences may be guided by teachers who
encourage hard work and growth in their socialization
practices as a proactive method to counter society's mas-
ter narratives of race and intelligence. The teachers in
this school also engage in cultural pride socialization of
the students (Freeman, 2010).
One of the most important findings within existing
research on implicit theories of intelligence is the positive
relationship between malleable theories of intelligence and

achievement motivation variables. Within the present study,
the correlations found between self-efficacy and implicit
theories of intelligence suggest adaptive motivational char-
acteristics of these African American adolescents. Students
who are more self-efficacious are confident in their ability to
overcome challenges and to persist when faced with obsta-
cles, which would explain the positive relationship with a
malleable view of intelligence.
Limitations
There are a few limitations to the present study that are
important to consider. First, the quantitative method in
which implicit views of intelligence were measured in the
present study does not account for the possibility that per-
sons can hold both views simultaneously or have views of
intelligence that are domain specific. Second, the sample
may not be generalizable to the larger population of
African American adolescents due to the small sample size
and the unique learning environment of the sample.
Although there was a relationship found between some of
the achievement motivation variables and implicit views
of intelligence, a causal influence of these beliefs on
achievement motivation cannot be determined. In addi-
tion, these participants were enrolled at a school with a
commitment to success in the highly specialized domains
of science and mathematics. This specialized curriculum
may attract students who possess more growth-oriented
mindsets.
Future Directions
The present study was effective in capturing the nature of
implicit theories of intelligence for African American ado-
lescents, which had not been addressed in previous research.
Future research should investigate the way in which
implicit intelligence beliefs operate in different academic
domains to determine the contextual specificity for this
group. Employing a mixed-method research strategy that
includes interviews and focus groups could provide greater
knowledge of the underlying meaning-making process in
the development of implicit theories of intelligence.
Understanding the ways in which these students conceptu-
alize their academic identity may provide valuable insight
into the impact on subsequent behavior patterns that these
students adopt in challenging academic situations. It may
also provide insight into why differential relations were
found in the present study between students' view of intel-
ligence and different domains of achievement motivation.
To expand the generalizability of the findings from the pres-
ent study, future research on the nature of African American
adolescents' implicit views of intelligence should include
students from diverse academic and socioeconomic back-
grounds. In addition to increasing the sample size, it would
also be important to include sixth graders to explore
implicit theories of intelligence during adolescents' initial
transition from elementary school to middle/junior high
school.
Conclusion and Implications
It is not absolutely clear from this study whether these stu-
dents' malleable views of their intelligence mean that they
do not endorse the master narrative of race and intelligence
plotline that African Americans are inherently or innately
intellectually inferior. However, the findings from the pres-
ent study do strongly suggest that students in this sample
believed that intelligence can be developed. This may mean
that these adolescents were able to utilize their lived experi-
ences within a racialized society to create counter narratives
about race and intelligence that produce more adaptive
adolescent development.
This cultural historical complexity of the meaning of
master narratives of race and intelligence makes it challeng-
ing to make interpretations about the meaning-making pro-
cess an African American adolescent may engage in when
trying to develop a person theory of intelligence as either
fixed or malleable. Winston and Winston (2012) theorize
that when African Americans are asked to define what intel-
ligence means, the pervasiveness of master narratives of race
and intelligence within racialized societies cause most to
psychologically negotiate the racist ideology associated with
these master narratives of race to decide to what extent they
endorse or reject such beliefs as self-relevant. What is less
clear, however, is how specifically these master narratives of
race evolve and are responded to among African American
adolescents due to the relative immaturity of their cognitive
experience and the variable intensity of their exposure to
American culture's racist ideology. Nonetheless, because
these master narratives of race and intelligence are so theo-
retically pervasive within racialized cultures, it is likely that
by adolescence, African Americans have some exposure and
in some situations have to make sense of their meaning.
There is also some evidence from a study conducted by
Burrell et al. (in press) with students drawn from the same
sample as the present study, that these adolescents have
developed personal beliefs about intelligence in the form of
how intelligence characterizes what it means to act Black
and to act White.
For Dr. Benjamin Carson, his counter narrative con-
struction about race and intelligence was initiated by two
life-changing events in the fifth grade. First, unbeknownst
to him, a schoolwide vision examination revealed that his
eyesight was so abysmal that he almost qualified for handi-
capped status. Second, the engaged parenting approach of
his mother led to a more forceful hands-on intervention
regarding his education. Young Ben Carson was now liter-
ally seeing the world more clearly through his new glasses.
Also, due to an almost immediate improvement in grades,
he saw himself as a more capable learner who was able to
recognize the ongoing support of his teacher, as well as the
high expectation beliefs that his mother possessed for him.
Wynn et al. 9
Seeing that passing grade made me feel good. I
thought, I made a D in math. I'm improving. There's
hope for me. I'm not the dumbest kid in school. When
a kid like me who had been at the bottom of the class
for the first half of the year suddenly zoomed upward--
even if only from F to D--that experience gave birth
to hope. (Carson & Murphey, 1990, p. 33)
Dr. Carson had finally begun to develop his "adaptive"
lens, a counter internalized narrative of self about his intel-
ligence that would lead to one of the most successful careers
in American medicine.
