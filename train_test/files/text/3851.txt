Introduction
Adaptive metacognition as conceptualized by Brinol and
DeMarree (2012) plays important self-regulatory functions
in opposition to maladaptive metacognition (Wells &
Cartwright-Hatton, 2004). According to Beer and Moneta
(2010), "the adaptive use of object and metacognitive modes
requires metacognitive beliefs of an agentic type that support
identification of alternative pathways and flexible goal
restructuring" (p. 978). Moreover, the authors propose that
such adaptive metacognitive beliefs require meta-emotions
of interest and curiosity in an individual's own emotional
responses to challenging situations.
Beer and Moneta (2010) identified adaptive metacognitive
beliefs that foster success in facing challenging situations
among highly self-regulated and resilient individuals.
Thematic analysis revealed three main metacognitive factors
that helped them to manage challenges successfully: aware-
ness of the need to free attention resources and experience
positive emotions, confidence in interpreting emotions as cues
that help to solve the problem, and confidence in setting a
sequence of goals even in long-term hierarchies that make suc-
cess plausible. The latter means that a person is able to system-
atize the hierarchy of goals--from elementary to final ones.
Further analysis permitted constructing the Positive
Metacognitions and Positive Meta-Emotions Questionnaire
(PMCEQ; Beer & Moneta, 2010). Beer and Moneta clearly
support the three-factor structure of the PMCEQ in two
independent studies. Factor 1 is called the "Confidence in
Extinguishing Perseverative Thoughts and Emotions" with
items such as "I tend to overreact when things are really going
wrong" (reversed). Factor 2, named "Interpreting Own
Emotions as Cues, Restraining From Immediate Reaction, and
Mind Setting for Problem Solving" was assessed via items
such as "I can stop any `negative thinking spirals'and focus on
what I can do in the situation." Factor 3, called "Confidence in
Interpreting Own Emotions as Cues, Restraining From
Immediate Reaction, and Mind Setting for Problem Solving,"
was represented by items such as "If I were overwhelmed by a
big task, I would stop and take smaller steps."
Beer and Moneta (2010) not only produced the clear fac-
torial structure of the instrument but also provided an
assessment of the concurrent validity of the PMCEQ. Each
of the three factors of the PMCEQ was negatively corre-
lated with the five factors of the Maladaptive Metacognitions
Questionnaire (MCQ-30) developed by Wells and Cartwright-
Hatton (2004). Moreover the three factors of the PMCEQ
correlated positively with intrinsic motivation, but they cor-
related negatively with extrinsic motivation (Work Preference

Construct and Concurrent Validity of
the Positive Metacognitions and Positive
Meta-Emotions Questionnaire in the Polish
Population
Roman Konarski1 and Hanna Brycz1
Abstract
The Positive Metacognitions and Positive Meta-Emotions Questionnaire (PMCEQ) of Beer and Moneta measures adaptive
metacognitive beliefs when facing challenging situations. The psychometric properties of a Polish version of the PMCEQ
are reported. The cultural adaptation of the instrument was conducted in a representative sample of adult Poles (n = 600).
The original three-factor structure of the PMCEQ was corroborated by confirmatory factor analysis. Further psychometric
analyses indicated that the instrument produces valid and reliable measurements of adaptive metacognitive beliefs in the
Polish population.

self-determination theory, Deci & Ryan, 1985).
The objective of our study was to establish the construct
and concurrent validity of a Polish version of the PMCEQ
developed by Beer and Moneta (2010). To this end, we
examined the factor structure of the Polish version of the
PMCEQ, and we hypothesized the exact three-factor struc-
ture of the original PMCEQ (Beer & Moneta, 2010). We
extended our analysis of construct validity by establishing
convergent validity with a popular Big Five measure: the
International Personality Item Pool - Big Five Markers - 20
(IPIP-BFM-20; Strus, Cieciuch, & Rowiski, 2014, based
on Goldberg, 1992), and the Neuroticism-Extraversion-
Openess Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R; Costa
& McCrae, 1992).
We also aimed to examine the reliability and concurrent
validity of the instrument. This was done by correlating the
three factors of PMCEQ with another adaptive metacogni-
tive measure (Metacognitive Self Questionnaire [MSQ-24],
Brycz & Konarski, 2016) and another maladaptive metacog-
nitive measure (MCQ-30, Cartwright-Hatton & Wells, 1997,
Polish version--Dragan & Dragan, 2011).
The metacognitive-self pertains to accurate knowledge
about an individual's own biases and psychological regu-
larities that foster self-regulation, such as pathetic illusion
(Deutsch, 1960), positivity bias (Weinstein, 1980), rules of
social learning theory (Bandura, 1977), the perception of
nonverbal behavior (Argyle, 1991), and others. Each psy-
chological law, or bias, is presented in an episodic way, for
example, for positivity bias "I tend to judge other people
positively rather than negatively." The MSQ-24 measures
accurate self-insight in an individual's own biased behavior.
A person acquires this specific kind of insight while think-
ing about his or her own biased behavior and experiencing,
even at first glance, negative emotions. An individual with a
highly developed metacognitive-self accepts, over time,
biases or psychological regularities as immanent aspects of
human behavior. Thanks to a high degree of metacognitive
self-insight, an individual is more persistent in the face of
challenge, accepts uncontrollability (Brycz, Jurek, Pastwa-
Wojciechowska, Pepliska, & Bidzan, 2014), and exhibits
better self-regulatory functions (Brycz, Wyszomirska-Góra,
Bar-Tal, & Wisniewski, 2014). However, there is no correla-
tion between MSQ-24 and self-esteem (Rosenberg & Gara,
1985). We hypothesize either a negative correlation or a lack
thereof between PMCEQ Factor 1 and MCQ-24. If our sup-
positions are true, this might result from the necessity of
engaging in perseverative thoughts or negative emotions as
the first step of accurate self-insight knowledge acquisition.
MCQ-24 allows for better goal attainment and flexibility of
behavior in concordance with current affect, while current
affect is treated as a cue in concordance with the meaning of
PMCEQ Factor 2. Moreover, because we know that a higher
metacognitive-self fosters self-regulation and goal attain-
ment, we hypothesize a positive correlation between
PMCEQ Factors 2 and 3 (mind setting for problem solving)
and the MSQ-24.
Our further suppositions are related to correlations
between five factors of the MCQ-30 and the three of the
PMCEQ. The MCQ-30 (Cartwright-Hatton & Wells, 1997)
was created to measure maladaptive metacognition. Results
of numerous studies (Wells, 2009; Yilmaz, Gencoz, & Wells,
2011) indicate that negative beliefs about worry concerning
uncontrollability of thoughts and danger, and cognitive
resource limitations are crucial for Cognitive-Attentional
Syndrome (CAS). Moreover, the results of these studies
show that positive beliefs about worry and the need to con-
trol thoughts are strong predictors of both anxiety and
depression. The MCQ-30 consists of the five following fac-
tors: (a) cognitive confidence that measures confidence
regarding beliefs about the need to control attention and
memory, (b) positive beliefs about worry that measures the
tendency of a person to monitor his or her own thoughts and
focus attention inward, (c) cognitive self-consciousness that
measures the extent to which a person thinks that persevera-
tive thinking is useful, (d) negative beliefs about the uncon-
trollability of thoughts and danger that assesses the extent to
which a person thinks that perseverative thinking is uncon-
trollable and dangerous, and (e) beliefs about the need to
control thoughts that assesses the extent to which a person
believes that certain types of thoughts need to be suppressed.
In accordance with the results of Beer and Moneta (2010),
we expect the same negative correlations between MCQ-30
factors (MCQ-30, Cartwright-Hatton & Wells, 1997; Polish
version--Dragan & Dragan, 2011) and the three PMCEQ
factors in the Polish population.
Moreover, it is plausible to predict positive correlations
between the three PMCEQ factors and at least two of the
IPIP-BFM-20 factors of conscientiousness and emotional
stability, which are personality traits that favor personal and
professional success.
Method
Participants
A nationally representative sample of n = 600 adult Poles
between the ages of 17 and 85 participated in the study.
Among the participants, 312 were female (M age = 44.74
years, SD = 15.97 years) and 288 were male (M age = 46.69
years, SD = 17.10 years). The education structure of the sam-
ple matched that of the Polish population and comprised
20.5% participants with primary, 24.7% with basic voca-
tional, 35.7% with high school, and 19.1% with higher
education.
Procedure
The study was approved by the Polish Ethical Committee as
compliant with ethical principles. Participants were selected
Konarski and Brycz 3
randomly from the personal identity number registry and
approached individually at their places of residence. The par-
ticipants were informed about the scientific aims of the study,
and assured about anonymity. There was no reward for par-
ticipation in the study. Each participant completed the entire
battery of questionnaires that included the PMCEQ, the
MSQ-24, the MCQ-30, and the PIP-BFM-20 (described
below). Completion of the questionnaires took approxi-
mately 25 min. At the end of each interview, all participants
were thanked and fully debriefed.
Measures
The PMCEQ (Beer & Moneta, 2010) is an 18-item instru-
ment that assesses three factors of adaptive metacognitive
beliefs: (a) Confidence in Extinguishing Perseverative
Thoughts and Emotions; (b) Confidence in Interpreting Own
Emotions as Cues, Restraining From Immediate Reaction,
and Mind Setting for Problem Solving; and (c) Confidence in
Setting Flexible and Feasible Hierarchies of Goals. Each fac-
tor is measured by six items with a four-point response scale:
1 = do not agree, 2 = agree slightly, 3 = agree moderately, and
4 = agree strongly. The questionnaire was translated to Polish
and then back-translated into English by an individual not
previously involved in the translation process. Discrepancies
between original and back-translated items were discussed
and resolved through revision of the Polish translation. A
copy of the Polish version of the PMCEQ is presented in the
appendix.
The MSQ-24 (Brycz & Konarski, 2016) is a short version
of the MSQ-40 (Brycz & Karasiewicz, 2011). The MSQ-24
assesses a single metacognitive factor with 24 items in four
content domains (memory, attribution, great laws of psychol-
ogy and persuasion, and social influence). Each item pres-
ents a bias or psychological law in the form of episodic
behavior. For each item, individuals are asked to respond to
the following question: How much is each statement congru-
ent with your behavior, thoughts, and/or feelings. Responses
followed a six-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (defi-
nitely not) to 6 (definitely yes).
ThePolishversionoftheMetacognitionsQuestionnaire­30
(MCQ-30; Dragan & Dragan, 2011; Wells & Cartwright-
Hatton, 2004) is a 30-item version of the MCQ (Cartwright-
Hatton & Wells, 1997) developed to assess five correlated
metacognitive factors: (a) cognitive confidence, (b) positive
beliefs about worry, (c) cognitive self-consciousness, (d)
negative beliefs about uncontrollability of thoughts and dan-
ger, and (e) beliefs about need to control thoughts. Each fac-
tor is measured by six items with a four-point response scale
ranging from 1 (do not agree) to 4 (agree very much).
The short version of the Polish adaptation of the 50-item
Big Five Personality Traits (Goldberg, 1992) questionnaire
(Strus et al., 2014), IPIP-BFM-20 (Topolewska, Skimina,
Strus, Cieciuch, & Rowiski, 2014) is a 20-item version of
the 50-item Polish adaptation of the Big Five (IPIP-BFM-50;
Strus et al., 2014) that assesses five personality factors: (a)
extraversion, (b) agreeableness, (c) conscientiousness, (d)
emotional stability, and (e) intellect/imagination. Each factor
is measured by four items with a five-point response scale
ranging from 1 (completely inaccurate as a self-description)
to 5 (completely accurate as a self-description).
Results
Psychometric Analyses
The first task in the current study was to confirm the con-
struct validity of the PMCEQ in the Polish population. The
three-factor structure developed by Beer and Moneta (2010)
for the PMCEQ was evaluated by confirmatory factor analy-
sis (CFA) for discrete indicators using LISREL 8.8 (Jöreskog
& Sörbom, 2006). The CFA model was tested using the
robust (diagonally) weighted least squares estimator with a
polychoric correlation matrix. Because the value of the chi-
square model-fit test statistic is inflated by large sample size,
fit was also assessed using three widely used indices of fit:
the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the
comparative fit index (CFI), and the adjusted goodness of fit
index (AGFI).
Prior to the assessment of convergent validity, the reli-
ability of the measures was estimated. It is widely known
that traditional internal consistency reliability indices such as
Cronbach's alpha underestimate reliability when items are
not essentially tau equivalent (when they have unequal factor
loadings; Graham, 2006) or when the item response scale is
not continuous (Gadermann, Guhn, & Zumbo, 2012). As the
assumption of tau equivalence is unlikely to hold for our
measures and the item response scales are ordinal, we uti-
lized internal consistency reliability based on nonlinear CFA
utilizing polychoric correlations.
Concurrent validity was assessed by correlating the three
subscale scores of the PMCEQ with measures of related
metacognitive constructs (MSQ-24, MCQ-30), whereas con-
vergent validity was assessed by correlating the three sub-
scores of the PMCEQ with five personality factors
(IPIP-BFM-20).
Testing the PMCEQ Factor Structure in the
Polish Population
Prior to performing the statistical analyses of the PMCEQ,
the direction of the response scale of the six items of the first
factor (Item 1 to Item 6) was reversed to be congruent with
the remaining items. The chi-square test statistic of the
hypothesized three-factor model was statistically significant
( 
SB
2 = 276.89, df = 132, p < .001), indicating that the model
does not fit exactly. However alternative goodness-of-fit
measures indicated acceptable fit (RMSEA = 0.043, CFI =
0.976, AGFI = 0.953). Estimates of the factor loadings and
their standard errors are shown in Table 1, which indicates

that all factor loadings are statistically significant. Within
each factor, the estimated factor loadings range from 0.43 to
0.70 for Factor 1, from 0.40 to 0.65 for Factor 2, and from
0.47 to 0.73 for factor 3. The estimates of the factor correla-
tions were -.15 between PMCEQ-F1 and PMCEQ-F2, -.21
between PMCEQ-F1 and PMCEQ-F3, and .83 between
PMCEQ-F2 and PMCEQ-F3.
The relatively high correlation between PMCEQ-F2 and
PMCEQ-F3 led us to test the adequacy of a two-factor
model, in which the items of PMCEQ-F2 and PMCEQ-F3
were indicators of a single ("combined") factor.Although the
fit of the two-factor model was acceptable ( 
SB
2
= 317.09, df
= 134, RMSEA = 0.048, CFI = 0.970, AGFI = 0.950), it was
significantly worse than that of the three-factor model (scaled
2 = 36.46, df = 2, p < .001). Consequently, the hypothe-
sized three-factor model was retained as an adequate factor
structure for the PMCEQ items.
Reliability of the Measures
Reliability coefficients omega (McDonald, 1999), based on
polychoric correlations for the measures obtained with the
psych-package (Revelle, 2015) for the R system, are pre-
sented in Table 2.
Table 2 shows acceptable levels of measurement reliabil-
ity for all measures used in this study. The reliability indices
range from .75 to .93, while those for the three PMCEQ fac-
tors range from .79 to .86. Overall, the lowest levels of
reliability were obtained for the five personality factors
(IPIP-BFM-20-F1 to IPIP-BFM-20-F5), which can be
explained by the relatively short (four-item) subscales in the
IPIP-BFM-20.
Assessment of Concurrent and Convergent
Validity
Validity coefficients corrected for attenuation (McDonald,
1999) for the three factors of the PMCEQ are shown in Table
3. It shows that the pattern of validity coefficients is as
expected with negative coefficients between PMCEQ-F1 and
the MSQ-24 and the five factors of the MCQ-30 within a range
of -0.44 and -0.21. Moreover, as expected, the two remaining
factors of the PMCEQ--PMCEQ-F2 and PMCEQ-F3--show
relatively high positive correlations with MSQ-24 and the five
personality factors of IPIP-BFM-20-F1 to IPIP-BFM-20-F5.
Discussion
We demonstrated construct validity and acceptable measure-
ment reliability for the PMCEQ (Beer & Moneta, 2010) in a
nationally representative sample of Poles. The analyses of
the factor structure of the PMCEQ confirmed the three-factor
structure of the original English version of the instrument.
Moreover, the measurement reliability of the PMCEQ in the
Polish population was shown to be similar to that obtained
by Beer and Moneta (2010).
The results of the assessment of concurrent validity fol-
lowed those obtained by Beer and Moneta (2010). As can be
seen in Table 3, all five factors of the MCQ-30 negatively
correlated with the three factors of the PMCEQ, which indi-
cates the difference between maladaptive (MCQ-30) and
adaptive (PMCEQ) metacognition. The more participants
were immersed in positive meta-emotions and thoughts

(PMCEQ), the less they were prone to depression connected
with CAS (Wells, 2009).
Moreover, concurrent validity assessment revealed the
expected positive correlations between PMCEQ Factors 2
and 3 and the MSQ-24, which indicated that participants who
highly favored the hierarchy of goals (Factor 3, PMCEQ) and
valued mind setting for problem solving and treating emo-
tions as clues restraining from immediate reaction (Factor 2,
PMCEQ) were also high in the accurate assessment of their
biases. Both Factors 2 and 3 are more associated with cogni-
tion, social cognition, and rational thinking about self-regula-
tion and goal pursuit in the face of challenging circumstances.
The MSQ-24 is also a good indicator of the adaptive metacog-
nition. However, the MSQ-24 was not created to assess emo-
tions. Positive meta-emotions embedded in Factor 1 of the
PMCEQ correlated negatively with the MSQ-24. The
direction of the correlation obtained was as predicted. It is
evidence based that a person who tries to acquire accurate
knowledge about his or her own biases has to experience a
long process during which negative emotions about his or her
behavior are balanced by the acceptance of his or her social
behavior as typical behavior of human beings. However, once
a person possessed high metacognitive self-knowledge, she
or he has the self-regulation ability to foster goal pursuit and
to undertake challenges.
Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the
PMCEQ factors with the Big Five (IPIP-BFM-20) personality
factors. As predicted, the PMCEQ factors correlated positively
with the conscientiousness and emotional stability factors.
Emotional stability correlates highly with all three PMCEQ
factors. Conscientiousness correlates positively with PMCEQ
Factors 2 and 3. The positive correlations found between
PMCEQ Factors 2 and 3, and extraversion, agreeableness, and
intellect of the IPIP-BFM-20 seem very interesting. The IPIP-
BFM-20 recognizes extraversion as a trait in which cordiality
plays an important role (Ashton & Lee, 2001). A similar
approach to agreeableness saturates the trait in question more
with morality and modesty. Positive emotions embedded in
extraversion and agreeableness are in concordance with Beer
and Moneta's (2010) understanding of the adaptive and posi-
tive role of meta-emotions. Moreover, intellect/imagination
positively correlates with the three PMCEQ factors.
The results suggest that the Polish version of PMCEQ has
good psychometric properties, and it appears to be a valid
and reliable instrument for research in the area of adaptive
metacognition.
Hopefully, the Polish version of the PMCEQ will help
researchers in further inquiries on the role of metacognition
and adaptive positive meta-emotions in prohealth behavior
and goal attainment, and in general adaptive behavior.
Metacognition is one of the most studied psychological phe-
nomena, and it is crucial to distinguish the positive role of
metacognition (PMCEQ) from the maladaptive (MCQ-30).
