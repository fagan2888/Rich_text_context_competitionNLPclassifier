Abstract
Dietary supplement use has steadily increased over time since the 1970s; however, no current data exist for the U.S.
population. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to estimate dietary supplement use using the NHANES 2003­
2006, a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey. Dietary supplement use was analyzed for the U.S. population
($1 y of age) by the DRI age groupings. Supplement use was measured through a questionnaire and was reported by 49%
of the U.S. population (44% of males, 53% of females). Multivitamin-multimineral use was the most frequently reported
dietary supplement (33%). The majority of people reported taking only 1 dietary supplement and did so on a daily basis.
Dietary supplement use was lowest in obese adults and highest among non-Hispanic whites, older adults, and those with
more than a high-school education. Between 28 and 30% reported using dietary supplements containing vitamins B-6,
B-12, C, A, and E; 18­19% reported using iron, selenium, and chromium; and 26­27% reported using zinc- and
magnesium-containing supplements. Botanical supplement use was more common in older than in younger age groups
and was lowest in those aged 1­13 y but was reported by ;20% of adults. About one-half of the U.S. population and 70%
of adults $ 71 y use dietary supplements; one-third use multivitamin-multimineral dietary supplements. Given the
widespread use of supplements, data should be included with nutrient intakes from foods to correctly determine total
nutrient exposure. J. Nutr. 141: 261­266, 2011.
Introduction
The use of dietary supplements has increased over time in the
United States (1). The NHANES has been used to monitor the
use of dietary supplements since the 1970s. In NHANES I
(1971­1974), age-adjusted prevalence of dietary supplement use
was 28% and 38% among adult males and females, respectively;
in NHANES II (1976­1980), adult supplement prevalence rates
were 32% among males and 43% among females (ages $ 20 y)
(1). In NHANES III, (1988­1994) use of dietary supplements
was 35% for males and 43% among females (ages $ 2 mo) and
use increased with advancing age (2). Since 1999, NHANES
data have been collected continuously in 2-y cycles. NHANES
data have been used to describe the prevalence of supplement use
of children and adults in 1988­1994 (3,4), among adults in
1999­2000 (5), and among infants, children, and adolescents in
1999­2002 (6). The purpose of this analysis was to update the
prevalence estimates of dietary supplement use in the U.S.
population for all ages using the most recent data from
NHANES 2003­2006.
Methods
The NHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey that
samples noninstitutionalized, civilian U.S. residents using a complex,
stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling design (7). NHANES
participants are asked to complete an in-person household interview and
a follow-up health examination in a Mobile Examination Center. All
data presented in this report were collected during the household
interview. The unweighted interview response rate for all participants
was 79% for NHANES 2003­2004 and 80% NHANES 2005­2006.
Survey years 2003­2004 (n = 10,122) were combined with 2005­2006
(n = 10,348) for this analysis (n = 20,470). Individuals under the age of
1 y (n = 1003) were excluded. Pregnant females were also excluded (n =
674). Persons with unknown or missing data on the use of dietary
supplements were deleted (n = 35). Thus, the final analytic sample was
18,758. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants or
proxies and the survey protocol was approved by the Research Ethics
Review Board at the CDC/National Center for Health Statistics.
Demographic data, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, and level of
educational attainment, were collected through a computer-assisted
personal interview. Self-reported height and weight were collected using
the Weight History Questionnaire. Dietary supplement use information
was collected as part of the Dietary Supplement Questionnaire. The
Dietary Supplement Questionnaire is used to collect information on the

participant's use of vitamins, minerals, herbals, and other supplements
over the past 30 d. Detailed information about type, consumption
frequency, duration, and amount taken is also collected for each reported
dietary supplement use. Dietary supplement use was also examined in 3
major classes: multi-vitamin, multi-mineral (MVMM),5 botanicals, and
amino acids. For MVMM use, we constructed "use" as a product
containing 3 or more vitamins (DSDCNTV) and 1 or more mineral
counts (DSDCNTM) per supplement. Similarly, use of a botanical
ingredient product was determined by the botanical count variable
(DSDCNTB) and use of an amino acid-containing product was deter-
mined with the amino acid count variable (DSDCNTA).
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS
(version 9, SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 9,
Research Triangle Institute) software. Sample weights were used to
account for differential nonresponse, noncoverage, and to adjust for
planned over-sampling of some groups. SE for all statistics of interest
were approximated by Taylor Series Linearization. Data were analyzed
by the age groups specified in the DRI developed by the Food and
Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences (8).
Descriptive data are presented for the population, for adults only, and
by gender and DRI age group using proc descript in SAS-callable Sudaan.
For prevalence rates across age groups, we used Hsu's procedure (9) to
determine (for the population and within gender) which age groups had
the highest and lowest value(s) for dietary supplement use (10). Hsu's
procedure was employed once to find the largest and once to find the
smallest population prevalence(s); P-value was set at 0.025.
Adults ($20 y) were also analyzed separately from children to
examine relationships with BMI, race/ethnicity, and educational attain-
ment. BMI was defined as kg/m2 and the CDC BMI classifications were
used: obese (BMI $ 30), overweight (BMI 25­29.9, and normal-weight
individuals (BMI , 24.9). Education was divided into 3 groups: less than
high school (HS), HS diploma or equivalent, and those with more than a
HS education. Three race/ethnic groups are available in the NHANES
data: non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-
American. Group differences for the prevalence of daily supplement use
within BMI, education, and race/ethnic groups were analyzed using a
contrast statement in proc descript; significance was set at P # 0.025.
Results
Dietary supplement use was reported by 49% (44% of males,
53% of females) of the U.S. population aged 1 y and older (Table
1). In general, dietary supplement use in all categories increased
with age. Most people reported taking only 1 dietary supplement
(Fig. 1). The majority of users (79%) reported taking them every
day within the last 30 d, 12% reported use between 20 and 29 d,
9% between 10­19 d, and 9% reported use ,10 d (data not
shown). Across the 3 major categories of use, the prevalence of
MVMM use was highest (33%) followed by use of botanical
supplements (14%) and amino acids (4%; data not shown).
MVMM use was highest among those $ 51 y and was also high
among males 4­8 y. Use of botanical supplements was more
common in older than in younger age groups and was lowest in
those aged 1­13 y.
Among adults, 54% reported dietary supplement use. Obese
individuals took fewer dietary supplements (48%) than over-
weight (57%) or normal-weight individuals (56%) (Fig. 2).
Dietary supplement use was different among all education levels,
with the highest use in those with more than a HS education
(61%) and lowest use in those with less than a HS education
(37%). NHW whites had a higher use of dietary supplements
(59%) than non-Hispanic black (36%) or Mexican-American
(34%).
Between 28 and 31% of the U.S. population took supple-
ments containing 1 or more of the following vitamins: B-6, B-12,
C, A, and E; 17% took supplements containing vitamin K (Table
2). Use of vitamins B-6 and B-12 dietary supplements was most
common among adults $ 51 y and among children $ 8 y.
Vitamin C use was highest in those $ 51 y and among 4­8 y olds.

The use of selected minerals ranged from 18 to 27% in the
U.S. population (Table 3) and magnesium was the most used
mineral dietary supplement. Iron dietary supplement use was
highest among 4­8 y olds and lowest in 9­18 y olds. Among
males, 14­18 y olds had the lowest use of iron. Among females,
those aged 19­30 y and 31­50 y had the highest iron use at 23
and 26%, respectively. Use of zinc, magnesium, selenium, and
chromium was highest in those older than 51 y. Magnesium use
was lowest in those 1­3 y and 9­18 y. Selenium and chromium
use was low in those under the age of 13 y and highest in those
$ 51 y.
Discussion
In 2003­2006, dietary supplement use was reported by one-half
of all Americans, an increase of ~10 percentage points from
NHANES III (1988­1994) (2). The majority of people who used
dietary supplements used only one; however, ~10% of Ameri-
cans reported taking .5 dietary supplements. Among adults, use
was 54% in NHANES 2003­2006, an increase from the
NHANES 1999­2000 data that indicates 52% of adults use
dietary supplements. Dietary supplement use was associated
with weight status, education, and race/ethnicity. Similar to
other studies, overweight and obese individuals were less likely
to use dietary supplements, those with higher educational
attainments were more likely to use dietary supplements, and
NHW were more likely than other racial and ethnic groups to
use dietary supplements (11,12). Picciano et al. (6) reported
32% dietary supplement use in children from birth to 18 y in
NHANES 1999­2002, with the lowest use reported among
teenagers 14­18 y old (26%) and highest use among 4- to 8-y-
old children (49%). Our results show that "any" dietary
supplement use was similar in 14­18 y olds (26%) but was
43% among 4­8 y old children.
Among both adults and children, MVMM were the most
commonly reported dietary supplement, consistent with results
from previous studies (5,6,11,12). However, the definitions and
categorization of MVMM dietary supplements are not stan-
dardized (13). This lack of standardization makes it difficult to
compare prevalence estimates between populations and even
within populations. Radimer et al. (5) defined a MVMM as
containing 3 or more vitamins with or without minerals; 35% of
adults reported use of a MVMM by this definition in 1999­
2000. In the present analysis, we define a MVMM as containing
3 or more vitamins but required at least 1 mineral to be present
to call it a multimineral; 33% of the U.S. population reported
use of a MVMM by this definition. For comparison, we analyzed
2003­2006 data using the Radimer et al. (5). MVMM definition

and found that 40% of adults $ 20 y used MVMM (data not
shown). Thus, one clear pattern is that MVMM use is high and
has increased over time in adults and MVMM use increases with
age through adulthood.
Picciano et al. (6) reported MVMM use in the same age
categories and using the same MVMM definition as this present
analysis, permitting comparison of use over time in children
from NHANES 1999­2002 to 2003­2006 (change not statis-
tically evaluated between time periods). MVMM use among
1­3 y olds changed from 18 to 26%, from 25 to 32% among 4­8 y
olds, from 19 to 20% among 9­13 y olds, and among 14­18 y
olds from 14 to 16% between the time periods of 1999­2002
and 2003­2006. Thus, use of MVMM seemed to increase over
time in children 1­8 y and remained relatively stable in
adolescents 9­18 y olds when the time period 1999­2002 was
compared with 2003­2006.
This is the first report, to our knowledge, to characterize
botanical dietary supplement use in adults in NHANES since
NHANES III (1988­1994) (3). The 2003­2006 NHANES data
indicate ;20% of adults use a dietary supplement with at least
1 botanical ingredient, which could be in a combination product
(e.g. MVMM plus echinacea) or as a botanical dietary supple-
ment (e.g. a product exclusively containing echinacea). Data
from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey indicated that
;18% of adults and ;12% of children used "nonvitamin,
nonmineral natural products" (14). As with MVMM, classifi-
cation and definitions of nonvitamin, nonmineral, or botanical
dietary supplement is inconsistent (3). Current efforts at the
federal level to initiate a LanguaL classification system for
dietary supplements are being investigated. LanguaL is an
automated method for describing dietary supplements (15­17);
this type of system would harmonize reporting of dietary
supplements and allow for cross study comparison on dietary
supplement use.
Very little change occurred between 1999­2002 and 2003­
2006 among children and adolescents (age 1­18 y) for use of
dietary supplements containing calcium (10), vitamin A (6), or
folic acid (18,19). However, for iron-containing dietary supple-
ments, there was a 5 percentage point decrease in 1­3 and 9­13 y
olds, and a 7 percentage point decrease in 4­8 y olds from
NHANES 1999­2002 (6) to 2003­2006 (change not statistically
evaluated). This may be of concern given that toddlers are at
high risk for iron deficiency in the US (20,21).
The methods used in NHANES to accurately identify and
record the specific dietary supplements reported by participants
ensures high quality data. Although the dietary supplement data
are self-reported, 85% of the time, NHANES interviewers saw
the dietary supplement bottles and labels that participants
reported using to verify accuracy. We did not present data for
pregnant females and this information is virtually unknown
(22). The small sample size of pregnant females in NHANES has
been the primary challenge in ascertaining reliable estimates of
dietary supplement use in this population subgroup. Calcium,
vitamin D, and folic acid dietary supplement use has been
previously reported in NHANES 2003­2006 in adults and
children and is therefore not presented in this report (10,18,19).
In conclusion, dietary supplements are used by one-half of the
U.S. population and appears to have increased slightly in adults
since 1999­2000. MVMM are the most commonly reported
dietary supplement across all age groups. Botanical use is
reported by ~20% of adults. In children, more than one-third
report using supplements containing vitamins B-6, B-12, C, A,
and E. Dietary supplements may contain nutrients in amounts as
high as or higher than DRI recommendations and can contribute
substantially to total nutrient intake. Without consideration of
nutrient intakes from dietary supplements, there is a potential to
misclassify the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy and excess
(10,18,19,23). These data suggest a high prevalence of dietary
supplement use in the U.S. population.
