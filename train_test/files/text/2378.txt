Abstract
Introduction: Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of premature death and disability, and over 80% of the world's smokers
live in low- or middle-income countries. The objective of this study is to assess demographic and socioeconomic
determinants of current smoking in low- and middle-income countries.
Methods: We used data, from the World Health Survey in 48 low-income and middle-income countries, to explore the
impact of demographic and socioeconomic factors on the current smoking status of respondents. The data from these
surveys provided information on 213,807 respondents aged 18 years or above that were divided into 4 pooled datasets
according to their sex and country income group. The overall proportion of current smokers, as well as the proportion by
each relevant demographic and socioeconomic determinant, was calculated within each of the pooled datasets, and
multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between current smoking and these determinants.
Results: The odds of smoking were not equal in all demographic or socioeconomic groups. Some factors were fairly stable
across the four datasets studied: for example, individuals were more likely to smoke if they had little or no education,
regardless of if they were male or female, or lived in a low or a middle income country. Nevertheless, other factors, notably
age and wealth, showed a differential effect on smoking by sex or country income level. While women in the low-income
country group were twice as likely to smoke if they were in the lowest wealth quintile compared with the highest, the
association was absent in the middle-income country group.
Conclusion: Information on how smoking is distributed among low- or middle-income countries will allow policy makers to
tailor future policies, and target the most vulnerable populations.

Introduction
Tobacco use is a leading cause of premature death and
disability. Every year between five and six million deaths
worldwide are attributed to tobacco use and exposure to second
hand smoke [1,2]. Over five million of these deaths are attributed
directly to smoking, and about 600,000 to second hand smoke [3]
i.e., people who themselves do not smoke but breathe air polluted
by poisonous gases from those who smoke.
During the twentieth century, tobacco use rose to epidemic
proportions, mostly due to aggressive marketing by the tobacco
industry. Tobacco consumption is still rising globally, largely
because the industry is targeting young people and women in
many low- and middle-income countries [4­7]. In response to the
growing epidemic, the World Health Organization sponsored the
WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO
FCTC) that calls on Parties to develop scientifically-based research
evidence to assist in tobacco control efforts. Improving the global
knowledge base is an important step to understand the
epidemiology of smoking and in the planning, implementation
and evaluation of appropriate interventions targeted at vulnerable
populations.
For many low-income countries, data collected over the past
decade through the Global Tobacco Surveillance System [8], the
WHO STEPS program [9] and the WHO World Health Surveys
(WHS) [10] have formed the mainstay of tobacco surveillance
activities. Limited but very useful information has been drawn
from these surveys. For example the data have shown that tobacco
smoking is not equally distributed among or within countries. The
highest smoking rates are seen in Europe (particularly Eastern
Europe) and the Western Pacific region, while the lowest rates are
seen in Africa [11]. In general, men smoke more than women both
in overall consumption and in prevalence [5], although in a few
countries women smoke as much as men. Examples of these
countries include Brazil, Denmark and Norway [11]. In 2006,
globally, an estimated 41% of men over the age of 15 smoked
compared with almost nine percent of women [12]. Furthermore,
smoking rates are often highest among those with the lowest levels
of education and among the lowest income groups [13­16]. In the
poorest populations, purchasing tobacco uses already scarce

resources and may have important indirect effects on health. Poor
rural households in china are reported to spend over 10% of their
total household expenditures on cigarettes [17].
Whilst tobacco surveillance activities provide useful information
for the implementation of tobacco control efforts, the World
Health Surveys provide the opportunity to examine complex
patterns of tobacco use and to identify the social determinants of
smoking. The objective of this study is to assess demographic and
socioeconomic determinants of current smoking in low- and
middle-income countries. While there are some examples of
studies exploring the determinants of smoking at national level
[14,15,17,18], there are few large cross-national datasets that use a
common measurement system for smoking, as well as demo-
graphic and socioeconomic information. Such a cross-national
exploration of the demographic and socioeconomic determinants
of smoking can provide useful information for policy decisions,
especially when focusing on low- and middle-income countries,
where there is a gap in knowledge caused by limited information
systems.
Methods
Ethics statement
Face-to-face interviews were used in all 48 countries. Written
consent was obtained in all surveys. A standard consent form
approved by the ethics review committee was read to the
respondent in the respondent's language. Once the respondent
agreed to participate in the survey, if the respondent was literate
the form was provided to the respondent to read over and sign and
was countersigned by the interviewer. If the respondent was
illiterate and gave consent to participate, the interviewer
confirmed this consent and signed on the form that the respondent
had been read the form, had understood the study and agreed to
participate. This procedure was approved by the institutional
review boards. The full list of collaborating partners in the 48
countries where the ethical procedure is reviewed and approved is
provided in List S1.
Study population
The World Health Survey was conducted by the World Health
Organization in 2002­04 to provide valid, reliable, representative
and comparable population data on the health status of adults,
aged 18 years and older, in 70 countries from all regions of the
world [19]. All samples were probabilistically selected with every
individual being assigned a known non-zero probability of being
selected. The samples were nationally representative except in
China, Comoros, Congo, Co
^te d'Ivoire, India, and the Russian
Federation, where the survey was carried out in geographically
limited regions. The response rates were reported in two steps:
household level and individual level. The response rates at the
household level were over 70% in all 48 countries except for
Congo (63.6%), Swaziland (53.8%) and Czech Republic (23.9%).
Individual level response rates varied between 82.2 and 100% for
each country [10]. To adjust for the population distribution
represented by the UN Statistical Division (http://unstats.un.org/
unsd/default.htm) and also non-response, post-stratification cor-
rections were made to sampling weights [20].
There were only a couple of high-income countries where the
data for smoking were gathered in the World Health Survey,
hence the setting of this study was 48 low- and middle-income
countries, in which data for current smoking were available, as
well as the demographic and socioeconomic factors studied.
Initially 234,548 respondents were eligible but 20,741 (9%) were
excluded from the analyses due to missing data on one or more
variables of interest. Table S1 shows the study population and final
sample size by country.
Data
The data from 213,807 respondents aged 18 years or above
were divided into 4 pooled datasets according to their sex and
country income group. Country income group refers to the World
Bank's development categories as of 2005 which are based on the
per capita Gross National Incomes (GNI) from 2003 (the year the
survey was carried out) [21]. Countries from upper and lower
middle-income groups were combined for this analysis.
Current smoking was defined as a binary variable indicating
whether the respondent currently smoked any tobacco product
such as cigarettes, cigars or pipes. Current smokers included
both daily and occasional smokers. In four countries (India,
Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar) data were also collected on
the use of smokeless tobacco. For the purpose of this analysis,
individuals who only used smokeless tobacco were considered
non-smokers.
The following demographic and socioeconomic factors were
also included: age, (in 6 age groups: 18­29, 30­39, 40­49, 50­59,
60­69 and 70+ years), sex, marital status (in 3 groups: married or
cohabiting; never married and divorced, separated or widowed),
highest attained educational level (in 5 groups: no education, less
than primary, primary completed, secondary or high school
completed and college completed or above), whether the
respondent was employed, whether the respondent lived in a
rural or an urban area, and country of residence. Furthermore, a
binary variable showing whether the respondent was the main
economic provider for the household was also included. To
evaluate wealth, a dichotomous hierarchical ordered probit model
was used to develop an index of the long-running economic status
of households based on owning selected assets and/or using
certain service [22]. The index was divided into five quintiles
within each country, where quintile 1 represents the poorest
wealth quintile and quintile 5, the richest.
Methods of analysis
The overall proportion of current smokers, as well as the
proportion by each relevant demographic and socioeconomic
determinant, was calculated within each of the pooled datasets.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association
between current smoking and the potential demographic and
socioeconomic determinants according to sex and country income
group. All analyses were weighted accounting for the individual
survey sample designs. Specifically, each respondent in the country
datasets was given a post-stratification sampling weight. This
weight reflected each country's population, in such a way that if
the sample size for two given countries are the same (but the
population sizes of the countries are different), more weight is
given to the country with higher population when calculating the
pooled estimates. Stata11 was used in all analyses.
Results
125,416 men and women from 27 middle-income countries,
and 88,391 from 21 low-income countries were included in the
analyses. The crude weighted prevalence of smoking was higher in
the middle-income country group compared with the low-income
country group for both men and for women. While this difference
was only marginal in men (over 35% of men smoked in both
country income groups), the prevalence of smoking in women in
the middle-income country group was over double that of the low-
income country group (13% compared with 6%, table 1). The

crude prevalence of current smoking in each of the countries
included in the analysis can be found in Table S2.
The prevalence of smoking was not equal in all demographic or
socioeconomic groups of the population. The highest rate of
smoking was observed in men in the lowest wealth quintiles where
almost one in every two men smoked (table 1). On the other hand,
women in the low-income country group who were educated or
wealthy were among the least likely to smoke. Less than 3% of
women who had completed secondary or high school smoked, and
only 3% of women in the highest wealth quintile smoked (table 1).
This was strikingly different from the pattern seen in the middle-
income country group where more than 10% of women smoked in
all educational groups and in all wealth quintiles (table 1).
Unadjusted odds ratios for each of the demographic and
socioeconomic factor studied can be found in Table S3. It is clear
that prevalence of smoking varies across the 48 different countries
in this study and that demographic and socioeconomic character-
istics are often closely interlinked. For this reason we used
multivariable logistic regression to calculate odds ratios adjusted
for demographic and socioeconomic factors and for country of
residence. In the middle-income country group, the odds of
smoking increased with age until about 50 years old for both men
and women after which they began to decrease. For example, men
aged 40­49 were 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1­1.4) times more likely to smoke
compared with those aged 18­29 after controlling for factors such
as marital status, education, employment and wealth. Similarly,

women of this age group were 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1­1.4) times more
likely to smoke than their 18­29 year old counterpart (table 2).
While in the middle-income country group, the odds of smoking in
the oldest age groups for both men and women decreased to below
the levels of the reference category (18­29 years), this pattern was
markedly different for women in the low-income country group,
where the adjusted odds ratios were highest in the oldest age
groups. Women ages 50­59 were over 6 times more likely to
smoke compared with women ages 18­29 (table 2). The pattern
for men in the low-income country group was more similar to the
middle-income country group except the magnitude of the effect
was higher and although there was a reduction after age 50 years,
the odds of smoking was never smaller than in the reference
category (table 2).
Generally, divorced, separated or widowed individuals were
more likely to smoke than married or cohabiting individuals and
those who had never been married (table 2). This pattern was
observed in all but women in the low-income country group where
the differences in marital status groups were not significant. The
protective effect of education on smoking was apparent in men
and in women, in both middle-income and the low-income
country group. Individuals with no education were generally about
3 times more likely to smoke than those with a college education
on higher (table 2).
Smoking also appeared to be more prevalent in those
employed compared with those not working for pay, and this
was significant after controlling for age, education and wealth in
all settings except women of the low-income country group.
Furthermore, women of the middle-income country group were
more likely to smoke if they were the main economic provider of
the household (table 2). The effect of wealth was not equal in men
and women from the middle-income or the low-income country
groups. Examining the pattern in men, we found that the poorest
men were more likely to smoke even after controlling for
important factors such as age or education. This was apparent in
both the low- and the middle-income country groups. However,
the effect of wealth on the likelihood of women smoking was
apparently quite different in the middle-income country group
compared with the low-income country group. For example,
women in the poorest quintile were twice as likely to smoke
compared with women in the highest wealth quintile if they lived
in a low income country. Nevertheless, if they lived in a middle
income country, all wealth groups had similar rates of smoking
and the adjusted odds ratios actually showed a decreased likely
hood of smoking in poorer quintiles although this did not reach
statistical significance except for quintile 2 (table 2). Finally, in the
middle-income country group urban populations were more
likely to smoke, while in the low-income country group there was
no effect.
Discussion
This study used pooled data from 48 countries taking part in the
World Health Surveys to analyse the demographic and socioeco-
nomic determinants of current smoking in men and in women
living in low- or middle-income countries. We show that smoking
levels are not equal in all demographic and socioeconomic groups
of the population, and that the distribution of smoking among the
population is not always the same in low- and middle-income
countries. In our study, some factors were fairly stable across the
four datasets studied: for example, individuals were more likely to
smoke if they had little or no education, regardless of if they were
male or female, or lived in a low or a middle income country.
Nevertheless, other factors, notably age and wealth, showed a
differential effect on smoking by sex or country income group.
While the proportion of smokers decreased after age 50 in the
middle-income country group, it remained high in the older age
groups in the low-income country group. Furthermore, we found
that wealth was inversely associated with smoking in the low-
income country group but to a lesser extent, or not at all, in the
middle-income country group.
These findings suggest that tobacco control initiatives in low-
income countries must really be targeted at all age groups. The
large proportion of smokers in older age groups is worrisome
because it suggests smoking cessation is uncommon in these
populations and older persons are especially vulnerable to adverse
health conditions associated with smoking due to comorbidities
and weakened immune systems. That smoking was strongly
associated with wealth in the low-income country group was not
entirely unexpected as the association between smoking and
poverty has been widely observed [15­17]. Nevertheless it was
surprising that the effect was less pronounced or absent in the
middle-income country group. Our finding suggests in these
countries, education is a more important determinant of smoking
than poverty and that preventative efforts should aim at reducing
tobacco consumption in poorly educated groups.
In fact education was a key determinant of smoking after
controlling for age and socioeconomic factors regardless of the
country-income group. Historically, in developed nations the
tobacco epidemic began in elite and highly educated, and then
spread to lower socioeconomic groups [23]. This trend has been
shown to be quite different in developing countries where the more
educated have tended to avoid smoking initiation perhaps due to
the accessibility of information regarding the health risks [18].
Disparities in health behaviours are difficult to explain due to
complex and competing, underlying factors. Individuals in the
lowest education group may differ from individuals in the highest
education group in terms other than education, such as socio-
cultural characteristics, family background or current living
arrangement. For example, one study concluded that a substantial
portion of educational disparities seen in smoking rates can be
attributable to factors shared by siblings that contribute to
shortened educational careers [24].
It may seem surprising that employment was only marginally
associated with smoking, but this may reflect the categorization
used in this study. For example, our reference category ``not
working for pay'' is made up of people seeking employment, as
well as those who are not seeking employment because they are
maintained by their spouse and work in the home. Additionally,
we did not consider the type of employment and some studies have
shown a higher prevalence of smoking people with working class
jobs [15]. We also found that women in the middle-income
country group who were the main economic provider of the
household showed a moderate but significant increased risk of
smoking. Personal economic freedom to use ones earnings to
purchase cigarettes would be the most obvious reasoning behind
this association. However, it is also possible, at least in middle-
income countries, that the higher odds of smoking in women who
were the main economic provider may be linked to the idea that
tobacco smoking in women represents independence and
modernity. This gender perspective may tell us why a similar
effect was not seen in men in these middle-income countries.
Finally, we found that residence in urban areas was related to
increased likelihood of smoking in the middle-income country
group. Similarly, studies in high-income countries have shown that
individuals living in metropolitan areas are more likely to be
current smokers than rural inhabitants [25]. The lack of an effect
found in the low-income country group may reflect that the urban

areas themselves are less developed than in middle-income
countries.
Overall, whether or not a person chooses to smoke may be
determined by many factors, such as socioeconomic context, working
conditions, where one lives, availability of tobacco products, whether
one has peers or family members who smoke, or even the level of
cultural acceptance in smoking [26]. For example, women in
Southeast Asia traditionally have a very low level of smoking and in
this area it is not a social norm for women to smoke [6]. Furthermore,
low education smokers are more likely to live with other smokers and
less likely to seek assistance to quit smoking [27].
In this study we used pooled data from 27 middle-income
countries and 21 low-income countries. It is clear that the
distribution of smoking within each country in the pooled datasets
may not be identical and this variation could influence our effect
estimates. We did not explore the interaction effects of our study's
independent variables within each of the countries. It should be
noted, however, that we did include a country variable in our
multivariate model in order to control for any potential
confounding effect related to the individual countries. Our focus
is to provide estimates of how smoking is distributed in the low-
income and the middle-income country groups and what factors

influence the variations in patterns. It is these variations across
settings that will provide the nuanced evidence for policy and it is
in these settings that decision making is made difficult by the lack
of valid and appropriately detailed information.
It should be noted that we defined smoking as current smokers,
which included both daily and non-daily smokers. Some studies
suggest that non-daily smokers have distinct socio-demographic
characteristics [28] and thus their inclusion could have influenced
our estimations. However, when we restricted the analysis to daily
smokers the results were very similar. We included non-daily
smokers to be comparable with other studies and because their
exposure to tobacco smoke still gives them an increased risk of the
negative health consequences associated with smoking. However,
one limitation of this study is that we did not consider the
frequency and intensity of smoking.
Furthermore, we mainly considered individual level variables.
We did not evaluate potential contextual effects such as
neighbourhood, although living in the most disadvantaged areas
has been associated with higher odds of smoking even after
controlling for individual level socioeconomic factors [29]. That
being said, we did find an association between current smoking
and residence in urban areas in the middle-income country group.
This finding is in line with the idea that ones living environment
may play an important role in whether or not a person chooses to
smoke. Finally, we limited our analyses to the socioeconomic
conditions of the respondent at the time of survey without
considering early life conditions. One study has shown that the
socioeconomic conditions an individual experiences throughout
his/her life course may accumulate to produce increased rates of
smoking uptake and reduced rates of cessation [30].
It is possible that a selection bias may have occurred in the
sampling process especially in countries with lower response rate,
although we are not aware of evidence to suggest that this had
occurred. The main reason for household non-response was
inability to locate the selected households or the households
refusing to participate even before a roster could be obtained.
Given that these factors are unlikely to be associated with the
outcome of interest for this analysis (tobacco smoking) we do not
believe non-response will have influences the overall results.
Health levels vary across different groups of the population and
such differences can be determined socially, demographically,
economically or geographically. When differences are preventable
or reversible, they represent health inequity which is considered a
social injustice [31­33]. Differential exposure to known risk
factors, such as tobacco smoke, is clearly linked to inequity as the
burden of disease attributed to smoking is unfairly affecting the less
educated, less wealthy parts of society. Given that effective tobacco
control initiatives do exist, this excess morbidity and mortality is
reducible. Unless comprehensive tobacco prevention measures are
able to reach all areas of society the gaps will only continue to
grow. Here we provide composite estimations of the distribution of
tobacco smoking in low- and middle-income countries. The
findings will be informative for policy makers and other decision
makers, allowing them to tailor future policies, and target the most
vulnerable populations.
