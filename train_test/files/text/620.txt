OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between body mass index (BMI; kgam2) and mortality in a large nationally
representative sample of US adults over age 70 years.
DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort study, the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA). Subjects were all those 7260
black and white people (2769 men, 4491 women) initially interviewed in 1984 for whom height and weight were
available. These subjects were followed through to 1990.
MEASUREMENTS: Measurements included self-reported height and weight, date of death if subjects died, sex, age,
race, measures of socio-economic status, number of living ®rst degree relatives, and responses to questions asking
whether the subject had retired due to poor health, had dif®culty eating, worried about their health, and felt their
health was worse than during the prior year. Smoking status was not assessed.
RESULTS: When analyzed via Cox proportional hazard regression, the relationship between BMI and mortality,
represented by means of hazard ratio, was clearly U-shaped for both men and women. The base of the curves was
fairly wide suggesting that a broad range of BMIs are well tolerated by older adults. The minimum mortality
(estimated from the ®tted proportional hazard models) occurred at a BMI of approximately 31.7 for women and 28.8
for men. The results were essentially unchanged, if analyses were weighted, if various disease states were controlled
for, and if apparently unhealthy subjects were excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: The ®nding of the relatively high BMI (27±30 for men, 30±35 for women) associated with minimum
hazard in persons older than seventy years supports some previously documented ®ndings1 and opposes others2 and,
if con®rmed in future research, has implications for public health and clinical recommendations.
Keywords: body mass index (BMI); obesity; mortality; elderly; aged; Cox proportional hazard regression.
Introduction
In 1985 Andres1 published a re-analysis of the Metro-
politan Life Insurance Company data suggesting that
the relationship between mortality and body mass
index (BMI; kgam2) appeared to be U-shaped, the
BMI associated with minimum mortality appeared to
increase with age throughout adulthood, and the
optimal BMIs for older people were higher than
conventionally believed. Since then, each of these
issues has generated some controversy and debate.
One small scale (n  758) longitudinal study of
elderly subjects3 failed to observe any elevation in
mortality risk with increasing BMIs but most long-
itudinal studies have con®rmed the U-shaped
BMIamortality relationship in older men and
women.4±8 At least one widely cited study,2 that of
the Seventh Day Adventists, found a monotonic
increasing relation between mortality and BMI and
no increase in optimal BMIs with age. However,
a recent reanalysis9 strongly questions the conclu-
sions of the Adventist Study. The BMIs associated
with minimum mortality have generally been high4
in studies of older people, typically ranging from
approximately 25±32. 7,8 This is in contrast to younger
people, among whom optimal BMIs are generally
thought to be in the range of about 20±25. Finally, a
study involving in-hospital mortality found that mini-
mum mortality occurred in BMIs ranging from
approximately 32±40 among elderly individuals.10
This ®nal study is quite interesting but probably
estimates a very different effect than do studies of
the longer term effects of BMI on mortality.
The purpose of this study is to assess the BMI
mortality relationship in a large nationally represen-
tative sample of US adults. Advantages of the sample
to be employed include its representativeness, large
size, inclusion of both men and women, inclusion of
substantial numbers of blacks and whites, and rela-
tively advanced age (all subjects ! 70 y of age at
entry). Additionally, inclusion of baseline indicators
of poor health allow control for the effects of apparent
ill-health.

Methods
Description of the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA)
The LSOA is based on both the 1984 National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Supplement on
Aging (SOA). For details see References 11±13.
These surveys select subjects through multi-stage
probability sampling procedures designed to yield
unbiased estimates of population parameters for the
US noninstitutionalized civilian population. A total of
7541 people age 70 y and over were interviewed in
their homes during 1984. These subjects were then
surveyed again in 1986, 1988, and 1990. These latter
surveys used computer assisted telephone interviews
and mailed questionnaires. Information assessed
includes selected lifestyle and demographic informa-
tion, numerous questions about health and disease,
cause and date of death for any subjects dying during
the study (obtained by record matching to the National
Death Index), and height and weight at entry.
Subjects
The subjects in this study include all those persons
interviewed in 1984 for whom height and weight were
available, 7397 in total (2829 men, 4568 women).
However, only subjects who de®ned themselves as
black and white were used in this study, since there
were so relatively few subjects of the other race;
which resulted in the total sample size of 7260
(2769 men and 4491 women). Furthermore, the
actual sample size available for particular analyses
may be lower due to missing data on variables
included within these analyses. Within each analysis,
missing data were handled by listwise deletion.14
Descriptive statistics for the sample are provided in
Table 1.
Statistical analysis
The primary statistical analysis consisted of
(unweighted) Cox proportional hazard regression15
with time to death from the initial interview as the
end point. The unweighted analysis was chosen
because, as Harris et al16 suggest, when estimation
of effects rather than baseline characteristics is the
main goal, weighting is less obviously necessary and
in¯ates the variances of parameter estimates. The
independent variable (BMI) and potential confounders
were entered into the model as continuous variables or
dichotomous variables. Higher order power polyno-
mials of BMI were included to represent curved
effects if they were statistically signi®cant.
Although this was the primary analytic approach
taken, several alternatives were tried as a form of
sensitivity analysis to determine if the results were
essentially unchanged regardless of the method
chosen. This included: (1) categorizing BMI into
deciles and treating it as a categorical variable to
take into account the possibility of markedly nonlinear
relationships between this variable and the end
point;17 (2) transforming BMI to BMI71 to see if it
enhanced the model's ®t to the data; (3) repeating the
analysis using the sample weights; (4) repeating the
analysis on only those subjects that appeared to be in
good health, and (5) repeating the analyses without
subjects with BMIs less than 16 or greater than 40.
This last approach was adopted to account for the
possiblity that values outside the range of 16±40 were
likely to represent data codingatranscription errors or
high leverage points.
Because sex, age, and race are often found to be
associated with both BMI and longevity, they were
selected as potential covariates in the model. More-
over, interaction terms between BMI and age and sex
were incorporated to test for possible effect modi®ca-
tion by age and sex. Income and education were

included in order to control for socioeconomic status
(SES), which may be a marker for access to health
care or quality of living conditions. Number of living
®rst degree relatives was included because explora-
tory univariate analyses showed it to be related to both
BMI and mortality, (the correlation of number of
living relatives with BMI was 0.12 (P ` 0.001). The
point-biserial correlation between number of living
relatives and dying before the end of the study was
70.05 (P ` 0.001)). Finally, four variables that were
putative markers of prevalent disease or preexisting
poor health were included. These were af®rmative
responses to questions asking whether the subject had
retired due to poor health, had dif®culty eating,
worried about their health, and felt their health was
worse than during the prior year. We had hoped to
control for smoking but the necessary information was
not available.
In determining which variables to retain as covari-
ates, we used heuristic guidelines proposed by Green-
land.18 Speci®cally, we retained in the model any
covariates that were statistically signi®cant at the
two-sided 0.20a level or caused a 10% or greater
change in the estimated regression coef®cients for
BMI and its polynomials and associated interactions
when deleted.
In order to estimate the BMI associated with mini-
mum mortality, the ®rst derivative of the ®tted func-
tions was taken with respect to BMI. This derivative
was then set equal to zero and BMI was solved for.
Results
Preliminary analysis
The unadjusted relationship between BMI and all-
cause mortality is depicted in Figure 1 by means of
death rate in each of the BMI deciles. As can be seen,
the relationship appears hyperbolic with a slight
elevation in the highest decile for both men and
women, and the observed minimum mortalities are
in 9th decile of BMI, that is, 27.47±30.13 for both
men and women. However, this observation is based
only on BMI without any control for other covariates.
Main analyses
To determine a suitable model, all the covariates
under consideration, power polynomials of BMI up
to the third order and the interactions of these poly-
nomials with age and sex, were included in a full
model. Then the guidelines speci®ed above were
applied to select variables to retain. As a result,
power terms of BMI above the second-order were
excluded from the model. Race (Black or White) was
not statistically signi®cant either, and moreover, its
deletion did not affect the BMI and BMI2 coef®cients
by more than 10%, it was not retained. Interaction
terms between the BMI polynomials and sex and age
were examined: the age by BMI terms were not
signi®cant and their deletion did not affect the BMI
and BMI2 coef®cients by more than 10% and they
were therefore deleted. For the income and education
variables, only education met the criteria for being
retained in the model. Number of living relatives was
also tried as a predictor but did not meet criteria for
inclusion in the model. Indicators of pre-existing
health problems were all highly statistically signi®-
cant. Interaction terms between these health indicators
and BMI terms were tried but did not meet criteria for
entry in the model. We also tried models including
other indicators of preexisting disease as covariates.
These included af®rmative responses to the questions
`Have you had [disease] in the last two years?,' where
the disease categories were cancer, Alzheimer's,
osteoporosis, hip fracture, angina, hardening of the
arteries, hypertension, rheumatic fever, coronary heart
disease, myocardial infarction, other heart attack,
stroke, arthritis, diabetes, aneurysm, blood clot, and
varicose veins. Regardless of which covariates were
used, it did not appreciably affect the shape of the
mortalityaBMI curve or the BMI associated with
minimum mortality. Because there are concerns
about `over-control' in this context, we elected not
to include these covariates in the ®nal model. Finally,
we conducted analyses excluding subjects who died
during the ®rst few (for example 1, 2, or 3) years as
suggested by some authors,19 such exclusion made
little difference to the results. However, we do not
report these as part of our formal results as recent
work20 does not support the statistical validity of this
technique. Thus, the ®nal model retained is the ®rst
listed in Table 2, we refer to it as the `basic' model.
The estimated coef®cients and standard errors of this
basic model are presented in Table 3. The basic model
is also depicted by means of sex-speci®c hazard ratios
(to their corresponding minimum hazard with respect
to BMI) in Figure 2.
As can be seen, the relationship between BMI and
mortality, represented by the hazard ratios, is U-
shaped for both men and women. The base of the

curves is fairly wide suggesting that a broad range of
BMIs are well tolerated by older adults. The minimum
mortality rate occurred at a BMI of 31.7 for women
and 28.8 for men (Table 4).
Sensitivity analyses
Weighted analysis. The basic model was refit weight-
ing by the final sample weights provided for LSOA
subjects. This process increases the probability that
the results will be representative of the US population.
This model is displayed as model 2 in Table 2. As can
be seen, the parameter estimates are nearly identical to
those in the basic model and the weighted and
unweighted BMI mortality curves were observed to
be virtually indistinguishable. For reasons described
elsewhere,21 the standard errors of the statistics for
this weighted basic model are not perfectly accurate
and therefore the P-values from the observed w2 are
not accurate either. We do not, therefore, report the w2
and P-value for this analysis.
Excluding subjects in apparent ill health. In a further
effort to avoid any confounding effects of pre-existing
ill health, we repeated the final analysis excluding
subjects who provided affirmative responses to ques-
tions asking whether they had retired due to poor
health, had difficulty eating, worried about their
health, or felt their health was worse than during the
prior year. Three thousand, three hundred and five
such subjects were excluded. The model fitted in this
analysis is listed as model 3 in Table 2 and is
displayed graphically in Figure 3. As can be seen in
Figure 3, although the overall predicted hazard ratios

tend to be somewhat lower when apparently unhealthy
subjects are excluded, the shape of the BMI-mortality
curves (Figure 3) and their minima (Table 4) are
largely unchanged.
Analyzing BMI as a categorical variable. In the event
of marked nonlinearity, a categorized measure of
exposure may more easily capture the relationship
between death and exposure level. Therefore, we
repeated our analysis with BMI divided into deciles
as a categorical predictor rather than as a continuous
variable. However, following this exploration, it is
usually best to return to a model parameterized with
continuous predictors.22 Overall, the results were quite
similar to the prior analyses for the left side of the
BMI mortality curve. Moreover, the minimum morta-
ity was estimated in the 9th decile of BMI; which
reflects relationship between and BMI and mortality
depicted in Figure 1. However, in the highest decile,
the elevation in mortality was less dramatic than
Figures 2 and 3 might suggest. This appeared to be
due to the fact that the high-end portion of the BMI
curve associated with greater mortality appeared to
contain few subjects whose influence was `washed
out' in the highest decile aggregate effect.
Modeling BMI71: In an effort to determine whether
an alternative continuous parameterization might pre-
sent a different picture and attenuate the right side of
the U-shaped BMI-mortality curve, we refit the basic
model replacing BMI with BMI71 and BMI2 with
BMI72: Let us call this `BMI-inverse' model. These
inverses were chosen to model the potentially `hyper-
bolic' relationship. The overall model fit in was nearly
identical to the basic model in terms of observed
likelihoods. The resulting fitted model is listed as
model 4 in Table 2. In view of the BMI-mortality
curve of this model, it was observed that using the
inverse did indeed attenuate the apparently deleterious
effects of extremely high BMIs and, conversely,
accentuated the apparently deleterious effects of
extremely low BMIs. Because this model and the
basic model fit the data equally well (see w2 in
Table 2), we were unable to select one as the
`better' model. Nevertheless, we observe that the
two models provide nearly identical estimates of risk
for BMIs between 17 and 38 for women and 18 and 35
for men. These ranges encompass 95.8 and 96.8% of
the female and male samples, respectively. This BMI-
inverse model was refit by excluding ill subjects, and
the result is listed as model 5 in Table 2. The overall
shapes of hazard ratios in this model were seen to be
almost identical to those from the previous BMI-
inverse model with all subjects.
Excluding subjects with BMIs below 16 and above 40.
To evaluate the influence of the extreme BMIs on the
mortality relationship, the basic and BMI-inverse
models without ill subjects were fitted again with
further exclusion of subjects whose BMIs fell outside
the range of 16±40. The resulting equations are listed
as models 6 and 7 in Table 2, respectively. As can be
seen, this exclusion had some influence on the estima-
tion of coefficients. However, viewing the hazard ratio,
it was observed that the overall U-shaped pattern of
BMI-mortality relationship was little changed.

far, including the model with BMI as a categorical
variable. As can be observed, the variation of nadirs
across the models is small relative to the range
of BMI: 27±30 for men and 30±35 for women
(Table 4).
Discussion
The results of these analyses suggest that among
people aged seventy years and older, the lowest all-
cause mortality occurs at a BMI in the low 30s for
women and high 20s for men. The sample studied was
a nationally representative sample of US adults. The
®nding of a higher BMI (27±30 for men and 30±35 for
women) in relation to a lower all-cause mortality risk
in persons greater than seventy years supports most
previously documented ®ndings1 and opposes others.2
To some extent, the shape of the association of BMI
with mortality in this older group may be the result of
other in¯uences on mortality overshadowing or
`washing out' the effects of BMI among these older
adults or alternatively higher BMIs being protective
against diseases that primarily affect the aged. For
example, in a recent analysis of the LSOA data,
Wolinsky and Fitzgerald23 reported on the strongly
in¯uential effect of age and body mass interaction on
hip fracture risk in older women.
One interesting ®nding of this research is the lack
of differential association between BMI and mortality
by race. Some authors24 did not consistently ®nd an
association between BMI and mortality among Black
Americans, suggesting that the BMI mortality asso-
ciation may be different for Blacks and Whites.25
Although the total number of Blacks in this study
was relatively small, there was no evidence that BMI
affected their mortality differently than it did for
Whites.
A number of issues affect the interpretation of these
data. Firstly, there was no control for smoking as
information with regard to current smoking or `pack-
years' smoked was unavailable. To obtain some
estimate of the number of people over age 70 who
smoke and the relationship between smoking and BMI
in this age group, we tabulated data from the 1990
National Health Interview Survey. Of 2325 people
over age 70 who responded to a question about
smoking, 23% reported themselves to be current
smokers. These smokers had a mean BMI of 23.6
(s.d.  4.4) compared to a mean BMI of 25.1
(s.d.  4.2) for nonsmokers. Thus, it is plausible that
at least some of the increased mortality observed with
low BMIs in this study is due to confounding from
cigarette smoking. Similar issues apply to `ever'
smokers. However, although some studies do ®nd
that controlling for or eliminating smokers does sub-
stantially attenuate the elevated risk of all-cause
mortality associated with low BMI,26 the overwhelm-
ing majority show little to no effect of eliminating
ever smokers or controlling for smoking status (for
example see References 4±8, 24, 27, 28, 29). In other
words, the relationship between BMI and mortality is
not markedly different when controlling for (either
statistically or by strati®cation) smoking, suggesting
that the confounding effect of smoking on the BMI
mortality relationship may not be great. However, the
fact that other studies ®nd little confounding due to
smoking is hardly a guarantee that such confounding
did not exist in this study.
Secondly, the heights and weights were self-
reported. This is an issue shared with many other
studies5,26,30 evaluating the BMI mortality relation-
ship. Heyms®eld et al31 extensively tabulated
studies reporting the correlation between self-reported
height and weight. Among adults, eight studies
reported the correlation between BMI calculated
from measured height and weight and self-reported
height and weight. Seven observed correlations above
0.90. The eighth observed a correlation of 0.88. Thus,
BMIs based on self-report seem to be highly corre-
lated with BMIs based on measured values. However,
there are systematic errors such that women almost
universally underreport their weight and men tend to
underreport their weight when they are heavier than
average but overreport their weight when they are
lighter than average.31 In the case of women, this
underreporting would have no appreciable effect on
the shape of the curve if the underreporting were
roughly constant across the range of BMI. It would
only result in the nadir of the curve being moved
slightly to the left. However, the most obese women
tend to underreport their weight the most.32 It is not
immediately clear exactly how this differential report-
ing bias might effect results. Nor is it immediately
clear what the exact effect of men's misreporting
might be on the results.
Thirdly, although subjects with apparently ill health
were excluded in an attempt to reduce the potential
confounding effect of pre-existing ill health on survi-
val, it is always possible that some residual confound-
ing may have remained.
Fourthly, body weight was available at only one
time point. No information on weight change was
available thus precluding the estimation of the effects
of BMI in a dynamic versus static statistical model. In
other words, this study did not allow a differential
assessment of the effects of having a certain BMI as
opposed to changing one's BMI. Weight history as
suggested by Losonczy et al30 may be crucial to
understanding the relationships between weight and
mortality in old age. In a prospective study of
approximately 6000 community resident white men
and women age seventy years and older, there was a
signi®cantly increased risk of mortality associated
with weight loss from middle-to-old age. However,
after adjusting for weight change from middle-to-old
age, BMI in old age was a signi®cant predictor of
BMI among elderly people

mortality. This study30 highlights the value of asses-
sing weight change in addition to utilizing a single
weight time-point in understanding mortality out-
come.
There are obvious limitations associated with the
use of body mass as an index of fatness over more
thorough body composition measures. While BMI is
typically referred to as an indicator of fatness, it also
provides information on fat-free mass. As Baumgart-
ner et al33 discusses, the risk attached to higher or
indeed lower BMI's may be due to altered fat mass or
altered sizeacomposition of fat-free mass. Especially
in aged populations where the relationships between
fat and lean masses is likely altered,33 BMI may be a
poor indicator of risk. The differential association of
BMI with body composition may explain the change
in optimal BMIs across the age span.
Future research might pro®tably take several direc-
tions. These include similar prospective studies using
better measures of body composition than BMI, over-
sampling the extremes of BMI to get a better appraisal
of the effects of these extreme weights, assessing
weight and weight change simultaneously in dynamic
statistical models,34 and assessing cause speci®c mor-
tality.
