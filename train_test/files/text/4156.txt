Introduction
Cell phones are an integral part of college life and culture.
Even a casual observation of today's college students will
reveal cell phones being used, both overtly and covertly, in
every possible campus setting, including the classroom.
Research suggests that college students frequently use the
cell phone during class time despite rules against doing so
(Tindell & Bohlander, 2012). As cell phone technology con-
tinues its rapid development, the device appears capable of
contributing to student learning and improved academic per-
formance. For example, modern "smartphones" provide stu-
dents with immediate, portable access to many of the same
education-enhancing capabilities as an Internet-connected
computer, such as online information retrieval, file sharing,
and interacting with professors and fellow students (Bull &
McCormick, 2012; Tao & Yeh, 2013). Conversely, recent
research suggests that many college students perceive the
cell phone primarily as a leisure device, and most commonly
use cell phones for social networking, surfing the Internet,
watching videos, and playing games (Lepp, Li, & Barkley,
2015; Lepp, Barkley, Sanders, Rebold, & Gates, 2013). If
typically utilized for leisure rather than education, then cell
phones may disrupt learning within academic settings
(Levine, Waite, & Bowman, 2007). Thus, the potential rela-
tionship between cell phone use and academic performance
is not clear.
In support of the "cell phone as disrupter" hypothesis, a
recent study by our group (Lepp et al., 2013) found that cell
phone use was negatively associated with an objective mea-
sure of cardiorespiratory fitness in a sample of typical U.S.
college students. Interview data collected for the study
explained the negative relationship by suggesting that cell
phone use disrupts physical activity and encourages seden-
tary behavior. Unpublished interview data collected as part
of the same study suggest that cell phone use may also dis-
rupt behaviors conducive to academic success. For example,
when asked to describe cell phone use habits, one participant
stated, "I usually go on my phone if I'm bored sitting there in
class. Or during homework I'll take little Twitter breaks."
Another student said,
If I'm in class and I'm bored then I'll use my phone to look on
Facebook. I think it's just kind of a habit now that I have, which
probably isn't a good one. But, it's just that I always have it [the
phone] on me.

The Relationship Between Cell Phone Use
and Academic Performance in a Sample
of U.S. College Students
Andrew Lepp1, Jacob E. Barkley1, and Aryn C. Karpinski1
Abstract
The cell phone is ever-present on college campuses and is frequently used in settings where learning occurs. This study
assessed the relationship between cell phone use and actual college grade point average (GPA) after controlling for known
predictors. As such, 536 undergraduate students from 82 self-reported majors at a large, public university were sampled. A
hierarchical regression (R2 = .449) demonstrated that cell phone use was significantly (p < .001) and negatively ( = -.164)
related to actual college GPA after controlling for demographic variables, self-efficacy for self-regulated learning, self-efficacy
for academic achievement, and actual high school GPA, which were all significant predictors (p < .05). Thus, after controlling
for other established predictors, increased cell phone use was associated with decreased academic performance. Although
more research is needed to identify the underlying mechanisms, findings suggest a need to sensitize students and educators
about the potential academic risks associated with high-frequency cell phone use.

Across the interviews, such statements were more com-
mon among high-frequency cell phone users than among
low-frequency users. These statements suggest that some
students, particularly high-frequency users, may have diffi-
culty regulating their cell phone use during academic endeav-
ors such as class participation, homework, and studying.
Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the
relationship between cell phone use and academic perfor-
mance in a large sample of U.S. college students.
Literature Review
Although the cell phone is likely to be on hand while college
students are in class and studying, research investigating its
relationship to academic performance is limited. In an early
study of the phenomenon, Sánchez-Martínez and Otero
(2009) used a combination of self-reported monthly cell
phone expenses and frequency of use data to identify inten-
sive cell phone users in a large sample of Spanish high school
students. In the study, intensive cell phone use was related to
school failure as well as other negative behaviors such as
smoking and excessive alcohol use. More recent studies
operationalize cell phone use as calling and texting while uti-
lizing a variety of measures for academic performance. For
example, Jacobsen and Forste (2011) identified a negative
relationship between calling, texting, and self-reported grade
point average (GPA) among university students in the United
States. Similarly, Hong, Chiu, and Hong (2012) found that
calling and texting were positively correlated with a self-
reported measure of academic difficulty among a sample of
female, Taiwanese university students. While these studies
provide a starting point for understanding the relationship
between cell phone use and academic performance, they nei-
ther use objective measures of academic performance nor do
they take into account the cell phone's expanding capabili-
ties beyond calling and texting.
Modern cell phones enable users to access a variety of
electronic media at almost any time and any place. Popular
activities such as playing video games, surfing the Internet,
and monitoring social media sites are now all easily accom-
plished with most cell phones. Researchers have linked each
of these activities, independent of cell phone use, to aca-
demic performance. For example, heavy video game playing
has been associated with lower GPAs (Jackson, von Eye,
Fitzgerald, Witt, & Zhao, 2011; Jackson, von Eye, Witt,
Zhao, & Fitzgerald, 2011). Also, low levels of Internet use
have been associated with improved academic performance
(Chen & Peng, 2008). Chen and Tzeng (2010) found that
among heavy Internet users information seeking was associ-
ated with better academic performance, while video game
playing was associated with lower levels of academic perfor-
mance. Several recent studies have identified a negative rela-
tionship between social-networking site use (e.g., Facebook,
MySpace, Twitter) and academic performance (e.g., Rosen,
Carrier, & Cheever, 2013; Stollak, Vandenberg, Burklund, &
Weiss, 2011). In particular, Kirschner and Karpinski (2010)
demonstrated that Facebook users have a lower self-reported
GPA and spend fewer hours per week studying than nonus-
ers. Likewise, Junco (2012a, 2012b) found a strong, negative
relationship between time spent on Facebook and actual
cumulative GPA. These negative relationships have been
found in populations across the world, including North
America, Europe, and Asia (e.g., Chen & Tzeng, 2010;
Karpinski, Kirschner, Ozer, Mellott, & Ochwo, 2013).
Recently, multitasking has emerged as a possible explana-
tion for the negative relationship between electronic media
use (including cell phone use) and academic performance
(Jacobsen & Forste, 2011; Junco & Cotton, 2011; 2012;
Karpinski et al., 2013; Kirschner & Karpinski, 2010; Rosen
et al.,2013; Wood et al., 2012). Indeed, several studies reveal
that students frequently report using a variety of electronic
media including cell phones while in class, studying, and
doing homework (Jacobsen & Forste, 2011; Junco & Cotton,
2012;Sánchez-Martínez&Otero,2009;Tindell&Bohlander,
2012). Several recent studies, using a variety of methods,
identify a negative relationship between multitasking and
academic performance. First, Wood et al. (2012) measured
the influence of multitasking with an array of electronic
media on students' ability to learn from typical, university
classroom lectures. Emailing, MSN messaging, and
Facebook use via computer were all investigated as was cell
phone texting. Results showed that multitasking with any of
the technologies was associated with lower scores on follow-
up tests compared with students who did not multitask.
Second, Junco and Cotton (2012) used a hierarchical regres-
sion to determine the power of multitasking to predict actual
cumulative college GPA. Results showed that Facebook-
multitasking and texting-multitasking were significantly and
negatively related to college GPA after controlling for sex,
actual high school GPA, time preparing for class, and a stu-
dent's Internet skills. Finally, Rosen et al. (2013) observed
the study behaviors as well as study settings of a sample of
middle school, high school, and university students.
Participants were observed for 15 min with on-task and off-
task behavior recorded every minute. Results showed that
participants typically became distracted by media such as
Facebook and texting after less than 6 min of studying.
Furthermore, measurements of daily Facebook use and daily
texting behavior predicted off-task behavior during study
periods as well as self-reported GPA.
In review, emerging research suggests that texting,
Internet use, email, and social-networking sites such as
Facebook can potentially increase multitasking and task-
switching during academic activities and decrease academic
performance. Notably, all of these previously investigated
activities can now be accomplished with a single, Internet-
connected cell phone. Therefore, measurements of cell phone
use should not be limited to only texting and calling but
should take this wide array of activities into account.
Furthermore, and in consideration of the ubiquity of the cell
Lepp et al. 3
phone, the relationship between this expanded definition of
cell phone use and academic performance warrants
investigation.
Self-Efficacy Beliefs and Academic Performance
In addition to improving the way cell phone use is measured,
a better understanding of the relationship between cell phone
use and academic performance requires incorporating addi-
tional, well-established predictors into any statistical models
designed to assess this relationship. An abundance of
research suggests that self-efficacy beliefs are among the
strongest predictors of academic performance (for a compre-
hensive review, see Pajares, 1996). Generally speaking, self-
efficacy describes an individual's belief in his or her
capabilities to organize and execute the behaviors necessary
for success; as such, self-efficacy beliefs are a key mecha-
nism in human agency (Bandura, 1982). Self-efficacy beliefs
are domain specific; thus, research has identified self-effi-
cacy beliefs pertinent to academic performance (Pajares,
1996). The strength of academic self-efficacy constructs is
their influence over behavior. Students who report high aca-
demic self-efficacy apply greater effort to academic pursuits,
are more persistent in the face of obstacles, and exhibit a
greater interest in learning (Schunk, 1984, 1989). In addi-
tion, research illustrates that academic self-efficacy can
mediate the effects of academic ability (Pajares, 1996). As a
result, academic self-efficacy is positively correlated with
virtually all measures of academic performance, including
semester grades, cumulative GPA, homework, test scores,
and writing assignments (Multon, Brown, & Lent, 1991;
Pajares, 1996).
Research has demonstrated that efficacy beliefs are often
better predictors of academic performance than other com-
monly used social-psychological variables (e.g., Klomegah,
2007; Paulsen & Gentry, 1995; Pintrich & Schunk, 2002).
For example, self-efficacy proved to be the strongest predic-
tor of college student's academic performance in a model
including task value, goal orientations, metacognitive self-
regulation, self-regulation, and learning strategies (Al-Harthy
& Was, 2010). Two self-efficacy constructs in particular
have received much attention for their ability to predict aca-
demic performance (Pajares, 1996). These are self-efficacy
for self-regulated learning (SE:SRL) and self-efficacy for
academic achievement (SE:AA; Zimmerman, Bandura, &
Martinez-Pons, 1992). SE:SRL concerns an individual's
belief in his or her capabilities to proactively regulate his or
her learning on the path to academic achievement. This
includes belief in one's ability to resist distractions while
learning and to create study environments conducive to
learning. As such, it is an important variable to consider
when exploring the relationship between potential distractors
such as cell phones or other new media and academic perfor-
mance (LaRose & Eastin, 2004; LaRose, Lin, & Eastin,
2003; LaRose, Mastro, & Eastin, 2001; Odaci, 2011). A
related construct is SE:AA, which describes an individual's
belief in his or her capabilities to learn material from specific
content areas such as math, science, and history. As origi-
nally conceived and validated by Zimmerman et al. (1992),
SE:SRL influences SE:AA, which in turn influences final
academic achievement. As predicted by the original model
and subsequently verified, previous academic performance
can influence both SE:SRL and SE:AA (Caprara, Vecchione,
Alessandri, Gerbino, & Barbaranelli, 2011).
Research Question
Considering the existing research, as well as the unpublished
interview data presented in the introduction of this article, it
is hypothesized that cell phone use and academic perfor-
mance are related. However, in assessing this relationship,
there is a need to consider important statistical controls such
as SE:SRL, SE:AA, and previous academic performance
(i.e., high school GPA). Similarly, research suggests that
choice in academic major, as well as demographic and
behavioral factors, may also be predictive of academic per-
formance and should, therefore, be considered. This study
considered four such factors: sex, cigarette smoking, class
standing, and undergraduate major. Indeed, there are well-
established sex-related differences in college students' aca-
demic performance (Peter & Horn, 2005). Likewise, cigarette
smoking has been associated with problematic cell phone
use and poor academic performance (DeBerard, Spielmans,
& Julka, 2004; Sánchez-Martínez & Otero, 2009). Class
standing and undergraduate major may also be potential pre-
dictors (Kirschner & Karpinski, 2010; Sulaiman & Mohezar,
2006). In addition, there is a need to operationalize cell
phone use more broadly (i.e., assess total cell phone use) in
consideration of the device's increased functionality. Finally,
there is a need to use objective measures of academic perfor-
mance such as students' official cumulative GPA. This study
fulfills these many needs by answering the following ques-
tion: What is the relationship between total cell phone use
(i.e., calling, texting, video games, social networking, surf-
ing the Internet, software-based applications, etc.) and aca-
demic performance (i.e., actual college GPA) after controlling
for previously identified predictors of academic performance
(i.e., actual high school GPA, SE:SRL, SE:AA, sex, cigarette
use, class standing, and academic major)?
Method
The dependent variable for this study, academic perfor-
mance, was objectively assessed using participants' actual
cumulative college GPA. In addition, actual high school GPA
was used as a statistical control. Because these are sensitive
data, and collecting them involves accessing participants'
official academic records, participants were assured that data
collection, storage, and reporting would guarantee confiden-
tiality and anonymity. Participants were recruited during
4 SAGE Open
class time from courses that typically attract students from a
diversity of undergraduate majors. Representative courses
include introduction to sociology, general biology, American
politics, human nutrition, and world history. During class
time, the principal investigators explained the methods to all
students present, answered questions, addressed concerns,
and ensured that the informed consent document was read,
understood, and signed. After this, a survey was distributed
and completed during class by all students who consented to
participate in the study. On the survey, students provided
their university email address, which was later used to access
their academic records. If students did not consent to have
their GPAretrieved, they did not participate in the study. This
method produced an initial sample size of 536 undergraduate
students from 82 self-reported majors.
Measures
The survey took approximately 10 min to complete. Students
first provided basic demographic and lifestyle information.
Students completed the validated SE:SRL (Zimmerman et
al., 1992) and SE:AA scales (Zimmerman et al., 1992).
Participants also provided information regarding their cell
phone use as operationalized by Lepp et al. (2013) and,
finally, their email addresses. Email addresses were used to
access each student's official academic records from which
college and high school GPAs were collected.
SE:SRL is an 11-item scale that measures how well stu-
dents believe that they can use a variety of self-regulated
learning strategies such as finish homework assignments by
deadlines, study when there are other interesting things to do,
concentrate on school subjects, and arrange a place to study
without distractions (Zimmerman et al., 1992, p. 668).
SE:AA is a nine-item scale that measures how well students
believe that they can achieve success in important academic
domains such as reading, writing, English grammar, mathe-
matics, science, social studies, and computer use. For the
items in both self-efficacy measures, students used a seven-
point Likert-type scale to rate their perceived capability to do
well (i.e., 1 = not too well to 7 = very well). Responses for the
items in each scale were summed, thereby producing a total
score. Higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy. Both
scales have been previously validated and found to have
strong internal consistency (coefficient  = .87 and .70,
respectively; Zimmerman et al., 1992). Since their develop-
ment, both have been consistently shown to be reliable pre-
dictors of academic performance in variety settings (Pajares,
1996). Likewise, the SE:SRL and SE:AA scales demon-
strated strong internal consistency with this study's sample
of undergraduate students (coefficient  = .84 and .73,
respectively; N = 536).
Total daily cell phone use was measured using the follow-
ing item:
As accurately as possible, please estimate the total amount of
time you spend using your mobile phone each day. Please
consider all uses except listening to music. For example:
consider calling, texting, sending photos, gaming, surfing the
Internet, watching videos, Facebook, email, and all other uses
driven by "apps" and software.
Participants provided best estimates for hours of cell
phone use per day and minutes per day. Total use in minutes
was calculated for each participant as hours × 60 + minutes.
In developing this measure of total cell phone use, two focus
groups of undergraduate students reviewed the question for
content validity criteria, including (a) clarity in wording, (b)
relevance of the items, (c) use of standard English, (d)
absence of biased words and phrases, (e) formatting of items,
and (f) clarity of the instructions (Fowler, 2002). Most stu-
dents provided feedback from the criteria categories of (a),
(b), (c), and (f). Appropriate alterations were made to the sur-
vey based upon the responses and suggestions. In consider-
ation of this measure's construct validity, participants' daily
text messaging and daily calling were assessed as this is how
cell phone use has been operationalized in previous research
(e.g., Jacobsen & Forste, 2011). Total daily cell phone use
(calling, texting plus all other uses such as Internet browsing
and games) was positively correlated with daily texting (r =
.430, p < .001) and daily calling (r = .210, p < .001), suggest-
ing that the measures are related but not identical. In addi-
tion, we assessed construct validity in a small group (N = 21)
of undergraduate college students at the same university
from which the present sample was culled. Self-reported
total cell phone use (minutes) as assessed by this measure
had a large, significant correlation (r = .510, p = .018) to
objectively measured cell phone use (minutes) obtained by
accessing students' actual cell phone records (unpublished
data). Thus, this self-report measure was carefully developed
to assure content validity, while subsequent testing provided
evidence of construct and criterion validity.
Data Analysis
All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows
(Version 18.0, SPSS Inc, Evenston, Illinois). First, indepen-
dent samples t tests were used to examine differences in GPA
between males and females and smokers and nonsmokers.
Likewise, ANOVA was used to examine differences in GPA
between class (i.e., freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) and
a categorization of students based on the college that houses
their major (i.e., education, health, and human services; arts
and sciences; business and communications). Second,
Pearson's correlations were performed to examine the rela-
tionships between the following variables: college GPA,
SE:SRL, SE:AA, high school GPA, and total cell phone use.
Third, hierarchical regression was used to answer this study's
central research question:
Lepp et al. 5
Research Question 1: What is the relationship between
total cell phone use and academic performance after con-
trolling for known predictors? Toward this end, the fol-

The categorical variables of interest were assessed in the
first block of this model: sex, cigarette smoking, class, and
college. Blocks 2 to 4 in this model are identical to the model
developed by Zimmerman et al. (1992) and supported by
others (e.g., Caprara et al., 2011) to predict academic perfor-
mance. Block 5 added cell phone use to the model and
thereby tested whether or not daily cell phone use uniquely
predicted college academic performance (GPA) after con-
trolling for these other, previously established variables.
Finally, to further illustrate the relationship between cell
phone use and GPA, a tertile split for cell phone use was
performed. Students in this final sample (N = 518) were
divided into the following groups: low cell phone use group
(M = 94.6 min per day, SD = 41.0, n = 180), moderate use
group (M = 235.1 min per day, SD = 45.2, n = 173), and high
use group (M = 601.3 min per day, SD = 226.8, n = 164). An
ANOVA was then utilized to compare mean GPA across the
three cell phone use groups (high, moderate, low). Post hoc t
tests were performed for any significant main effect.
Results
Assumption Checking, Descriptive Statistics, and
Preliminary Analyses
Before conducting any descriptive or inferential statistics, an
examination of outliers (i.e., cell phone use, GPA, age,
SE:SRL, SE:AA) was conducted. Following the method of
Rosen et al. (2013), total cell phone use values that were
more than 3 standard deviations from the mean were trun-
cated to exactly 3 standard deviations from the mean. This
procedure was applied to measures of total cell phone use for
seven participants. Outliers on any of the remaining vari-
ables were removed from the study. This procedure resulted
in 18 cases being removed and yielded a final analysis sam-
ple of 518 students. The age range of the data set was 18 to
28, with a mean of 20.28 (SD = 1.78). The data set was
evenly distributed by class (freshmen = 132, sophomores =
139, juniors = 134, and seniors = 113). Females comprised
69% of the data set (n = 360), which is greater than the per-
centage of females (59%) in the overall undergraduate stu-
dent body of the University.
From this data set, the assumptions of regression were
examined, and a preliminary analysis was performed to
assess the linearity of the relationship between the study's
independent continuous variables (SE:SRL, SE:AA, high
school GPA, total cell phone use) and college GPA. Using a
Lack of Fit Test, the assumption of linearity was upheld (p =
.906). The assumptions of normality and homoskedasticity
were also met using residual scatterplots.
On average, students reported spending 300 min per day
using their cell phones (SD = 243). The sample's mean GPA
was 3.03 (SD = 0.60). Independent sample t tests demon-
strated significant differences between males and females
(p < .001) and smokers and nonsmokers (p < .001). Females'
GPA (M = 3.09, SD = 0.63) was significantly higher than
males' (M = 2.88, SD = 0.62), and nonsmokers' GPA (M =
3.07, SD = 0.64, n = 432) was significantly higher than
smokers' (M = 2.80, SD = 0.58, n = 85). An ANOVA demon-
strated significant differences in mean GPA between the four
classes (p < .001). Freshmen had a mean GPA of 3.21 (SD =
0.67), sophomores had a mean GPA of 2.93 (SD = 0.64),
juniors had a mean GPA of 3.02 (SD = 0.55), and seniors had
a mean GPA of 2.94 (SD = 0.48). Finally, the 82 self-reported
majors were categorized into three groups based on the col-
lege housing the major (education, health, and human ser-
vices; arts and sciences; business and communications). An
ANOVA found no significant difference in mean GPA
between these three groups (p = .081). Thus, this variable
was not included in further analysis.
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the continuous
variables used in this model. Table 2 illustrates the results of
Pearson's correlations. There are several significant correla-
tions worth noting. There was a significant, negative correla-
tion between cell phone use and college GPA(p < .001). There
was a significant, positive correlation between both measures
of self-efficacy (SE:SRL, SE:AA) and college GPA(p < .001).
There was a significant, negative correlation between both
measures of self-efficacy (SE:SRL, SE:AA) and cell phone
use (p  .041). Finally, high school GPA was significantly and
positively correlated with college GPA (p < .001).

Table 3 provides the model summary results for the hierar-
chical regression predicting college GPAwith total cell phone
use as the final block in the model. Each block significantly
added to the prediction of the criterion variable. In Block 1,
females had a significantly greater GPA than males ( = .120,
p = .007), nonsmokers had a significantly higher GPA than
nonsmokers ( = .155, p = .001), and class standing proved
significant as well ( = -.111, p = .013). In Block 2, there was
a significant, positive relationship between college GPA and
SE:AA ( = .210, p < .001). In Block 3, there was a signifi-
cant, positive relationship between college GPA and SE:SRL
( = .289, p < .001). In Block 4, there was a significant, posi-
tive relationship between college GPA and high school GPA
( = .553, p < .001). Finally, there was a significant, negative
relationship between total daily cell phone use and college
GPA ( = -.164, p < .001). This total model explained 44.9%
of the variance in college GPA (R2 = .449).
Finally, the ANOVA comparing GPA across the three cell
phone use groups (low, moderate, high) revealed a significant
main effect (F = 11.70, df = 2, p < .001). Specifically, the high
cell phone use group had a GPA (M = 2.84, SD = 0.61) that
was significantly lower (p < .001) than both the moderate use
group (M = 3.06, SD = .61) and the low use group (M = 3.15,
SD = 0.45). There was not a statistically significant difference
between the low use and moderate use groups (p = .175).
Discussion
This study was exploratory in nature. Therefore, the findings
are best understood as initial steps into a new line of inquiry.
The study's aim was to assess the relationship between cell
phone use and academic performance after controlling for
known predictors of academic performance. A hierarchical
regression was used for this purpose allowing for the devel-
opment of a model which used sex, cigarette smoking behav-
ior, class standing, SE:AA, SE:SRL, and high school GPA to
predict college GPA. Each of these variables were significant
predictors of college GPA. Females, as has been the recent
trend, had higher GPAs than males (Peter & Horn, 2005).
Smokers, as suggested in previous research, had lower GPAs
than nonsmokers (DeBerard et al., 2004; Sánchez-Martínez
& Otero, 2009). Class was a significant predictor as well,
with freshmen and juniors doing slightly better academically
than sophomores and seniors in this sample. As expected,
SE:SRL, SE:AA, and high school GPA were all positively
associated with GPA (Zimmerman et al., 1992). Finally, total
cell phone use (min/day) was added to the end of this regres-
sion model. After controlling for the previously established
predictors of academic performance, total cell phone use was
found to be a significant negative predictor of GPA. These
results suggest that given two college students from the same
university with the same class standing, same sex, same
smoking habits, same belief in their ability to self-regulate
their learning and do well academically, and same high
school GPA--the student who uses the cell phone more on a
daily basis is likely to have a lower GPAthan the student who
uses the cell phone less.
Previous research suggests that college students' cell
phone use may be a distraction in academic settings (Levine
et al., 2007). Two previous studies using large random sam-
ples of college students found that 89% (N = 302) and 83%
(N = 251) of the students surveyed perceived the cell phone
primarily as a leisure device rather than as an educational
tool (Barkley & Lepp, 2013; Lepp et al., 2013). Because the
cell phone is ever-present and commonly used for leisure, it
is likely that it occasionally distracts from learning in class,
in the library, in the dormitories, and in any other setting utilized
by students for academic purposes. In addition, there is a grow-
ing amount of research that suggests electronic media in any
form encourages multitasking (Jacobsen & Forste, 2011; Junco
& Cotton, 2011, 2012; Karpinski et al., 2013; Kirschner &
Karpinski, 2010; Wood et al., 2012) and task-switching

(Rosen et al., 2013), both of which are negatively related to
academic performance.
Considering these explanations, it is likely that the mod-
ern cell phone creates a temptation to surf the Internet, check
social media (e.g., Facebook), play video games, contact
friends, explore new applications, or engage with any num-
ber of cell-phone-based leisure activities, which some stu-
dents fail to resist when they should otherwise be focused on
academics. As such, the negative relationship between cell
phone use and academic performance identified here could
be attributed to students' decreased attention while studying
or a diminished amount of time dedicated to uninterrupted
studying. Indeed, a similar argument has been proffered to
explain the negative relationship between general social-
networking site use or Facebook use and academic perfor-
mance (Karpinski et al., 2013; Kirschner & Karpinski, 2010).
Future research should examine the many potential underly-
ing reasons for the negative relationship identified here,
including time spent studying and multitasking. Of course,
this line of research has demonstrated only relationships and
not causality. Thus, there is a need to explore these relation-
ships over time and with experimental designs.
There is also a need to better understand how specific cell
phone uses are related to academic performance. While this
study found that cell phone use as a whole was negatively
associated with academic performance, the relationship may
vary with particular uses. In other words, contrary to the
findings presented here, there may be specific uses that are
positively related to academic performance. For example,
Norris (1996) found that while TV watching as a whole was
negatively associated with political participation, watching
TV news and public affairs programming was positively
associated with political participation. Likewise, Chen and
Tzeng (2010) found that using the Internet for information
seeking was associated with better academic performance,
while using the Internet for video game playing was associ-
ated with lower levels of academic performance. Finally,
Junco (2012a) found that the total amount of time college
students spend on Facebook, as well as the total number of
times students check Facebook, were negatively associated
with campus engagement. However, some Facebook activi-
ties such as creating events and RSVPing for events were
positively associated with campus engagement. Thus, assess-
ing cell phone use as a whole is likely to provide only a par-
tial understanding of an undoubtedly complex relationship.
Additional research assessing time devoted to specific cell
phone uses such as gaming, social networking, information
search, and the use of educational software (apps) is needed.
While these findings build upon and extend previous
research in this area, there are limitations. First, cell phone
use was self-reported. Although the self-report measure used
in this study was carefully developed to assure content valid-
ity and a subsequent test provided evidence of criterion
validity, research by Boase and Ling (2013) illustrates that
continuous, open-ended self-report cell phone measures are
at risk of over reporting use. In lieu of objective data, future
studies may seek to further validate this measure.
Furthermore, future studies should assess the time devoted to
common specific uses such as social networking, gaming,
and information search, in addition to measuring overall use
as was done here. Second, the sample consisted of under-
graduate college students from a single, large, public univer-
sity in the Midwestern United States.Although the behavioral
norms governing cell phone use appear to be consistent
among today's college students (Anderson & Rainie, 2011;
Tindell & Bohlander, 2012), attempts to generalize these
results to other populations should be made with caution.
Therefore, future research should include college students
from different types of universities and from different geo-
graphic regions. In addition, high school and junior high
school students should be studied as recent research suggests
that the relationships identified here may be evident in
younger students as well (Rosen et al., 2013).
Conclusion
This research utilized a more holistic measure of cell phone
use than previous studies. The measure accounts for the cell
phone's expanded capabilities in the realm of social network-
ing, gaming, and Internet use. After controlling for SE:SRL,
SE:AA, and other important predictors such as actual high
school GPA, this measure of cell phone use was a significant
and negative predictor of college students' academic perfor-
mance, objectively measured as cumulative GPA. Presently,
cell phone use is a dominant and defining characteristic of
this generation of college students and often occurs during
class time, while completing homework, and while studying
(Smith, Raine, & Zickuhr, 2011; Tindell & Bohlander, 2012).
Therefore, more research is needed to better understand the
mechanisms underlying this relationship. Even so, educators
and administrators in higher education may wish to carefully
consider policies regarding cell phone use in the classroom,
laboratories, and other settings where learning occurs.
Undoubtedly, the capability of the cell phone to entertain,
connect, and inform will continue its rapid development. As
such, cell phones and related devices will only increase in
popularity and use. Therefore, there is a need to better under-
stand how this technology can be harnessed to make a genu-
ine contribution to student learning. We may discover
conditions where learning is enhanced by having the cell
phone on; likewise, we may discover conditions where learn-
ing is enhanced by having it off.
