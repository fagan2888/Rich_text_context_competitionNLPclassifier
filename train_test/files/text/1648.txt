ABSTRACT
This study investigates the relative contributions of socioeconomic status (SES), behavioral and clinical risk factors on mortality. The Third National
Health and Nutrition Survey Linked Mortality File was used to examine the association of SES (race, insurance, education, income), behavioral
(smoking, obesity, physical activity), and clinical (elevated blood pressure, triglyceride level, lipid levels, C-reactive protein (CRP)) risk factors with
6­12-year all-cause mortality. Respondents were stratified by known chronic diseases into one of the following categories: no chronic disease,
non-cardiovascular chronic disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The overall weighted mortality rate was 9.5% with the highest mortality
rate among diabetics. Race, insurance coverage, income, smoking status, inadequate physical activity, elevated blood pressure and elevated CRP
were independently associated with mortality in the overall population. When stratified by chronic disease, SES factors remained associated with
mortality, most strongly in the healthy population. Current smoking and inadequate physical activity were also associated with mortality across
disease groups while clinical risk factors were less consistent. SES factors, health behaviors and clinical risk factors were all associated with mor-
tality even when baseline health status and chronic diseases are taken into account. Efforts to reduce mortality will require a multi-faceted
approach incorporating healthy behaviors and accessible health care systems in addition to clinical advances

Background
A growing body of literature demonstrates that despite
marked progress in medical technology, reductions in USA
overall mortality rates have thus far been modest relative to
other industrialized countries.1,2 Advances in molecular
biology, genetics and computational biology have increased
our understanding of the biological precursors of disease that
may underlie mortality. Clinical risk factors can identify indi-
viduals who should be targeted for personalized risk
reduction strategies.3­5 At the same time, ongoing research
suggests that at least two other domains may be critical for
predicting morbidity and mortality. First, mortality is strongly
related to socioeconomic status (SES), as measured by
income, education or occupation, with lower SES associated
with higher mortality.1,6­8 Second, healthy behaviors have
also been shown to be modifiable risk factors for premature
mortality. McGinnis and Foege9 and Mokdad et al.10 identified
the major non-genetic modifiable risk factors that contributed
to mortality in the USA and this work was later updated with
2000 data. They estimated that approximately half of all
deaths could be attributed to risky health behaviors; the most
prevalent being smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity.
Despite the wealth of research showing that SES, health
behaviors and clinical risk factors individually contribute
toward mortality, these three domains are almost always
examined separately. Whereas studies of biochemical
markers and other clinical factors have predominantly
focused on high-risk populations who are receiving medical
care, research on SES and health behaviors have primarily
examined healthier, population-based samples. Few studies
have attempted to measure the relative contributions of each
of these risk factors on all-cause mortality in the same
sample.11 One study used county-level analyses in the USA
to identify regions with excess mortality due to chronic dis-
eases and injuries.8 Another study used a population-based
survey and registry to identify predictors of hospitalization.12
Behavioral, biological and SES risk factors from a 1998
survey were used to simultaneously predict time to first hos-
pitalization, demonstrating that risk factors from all three

domains were significantly associated with hospitalization.
The current study builds upon the previous work using a
nationally representative survey that includes clinical, SES
and health behavior data along with mortality follow-up to:
(1) investigate the relative contribution of SES, behavioral
and clinical factors on mortality at the individual level and
(2) investigate how the relative contributions of each of
these categories varies with the presence or absence of
known chronic disease.
Methods
This study uses data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Survey (NHANES III) Linked Mortality File, a
population-based survey and clinical assessment linked with
mortality follow-up. The NHANES III was conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in two
phases between 1988 and 1994. The survey was a multistage
cluster national probability sample of 33 994 civilian non-
institutionalized Americans that over sampled Hispanic,
African American and elderly populations, and consisted of
interviews, physical examinations and laboratory tests. The
sampling methods for NHANES III have been described
previously.13,14 The NHANES III Linked Mortality File
matched NHANES III participants aged 17 and older with
death records from the National Death Index (NDI)
through 2000. Because of the staggered interviews, the mor-
tality follow-up period ranges from 6 to 12 years post inter-
view. The linking of NHANES III and NDI records was
conducted by probabilistic matching and was completed in
2005.15 The study population was limited to adults aged 18
years and older with valid follow-up mortality information.
Sampling weights were incorporated in all analyses to
provide estimates that are representative of the entire US
adult population aged 18 years and older. Weights are also
used to account for the unequal selection probabilities that
result from the clustered design. Persons with a cancer diag-
nosis other than skin cancer were excluded from analysis.
Summary statistics were generated for continuous
measures as means (standard error) and for categorical or
dichotomized variables as frequencies (weighted percentage).
Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure the
primary outcome: all-cause mortality status as of 31
December 2000. Parameter estimates and odds ratios model
the likelihood of mortality. Analyses were performed on the
full population controlling for age (continuous), gender and
self-reported health status. Self-reported global health status
might be expected to be an important mediator or modera-
tor for the association between each of the three categories
of risk factors and mortality. The factors driving mortality
might also be different in respondents with particular clusters
of conditions. Respondents were thus categorized into one
of the four disease populations: diabetes, chronic cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) (high blood pressure, congestive heart
failure, previous heart attack, previous stroke), chronic
non-CVD (e.g. skin cancer, emphysema, bronchitis or lupus)
or healthy (reported no chronic diseases). Persons with more
than one self-reported disease were placed in the most severe
classification in the following order: diabetes, CVD and then
chronic non-CVD. SES risk factors selected for this study
included characteristics that have been shown in longitudinal
studies to be associated with mortality: race, income relative
to the federal poverty level and adjusted for household size,
health insurance coverage within the previous 12 months,
and level of education.2 Health behavior covariates included
characteristics shown to contribute to preventable mortality:
current smoking status, physical activity level and waist cir-
cumference as a measure of obesity.6,9 Waist circumference
was used because it has been shown to be a marker for
increased risk of diabetes, hypertension and CVD even in
normal weight participants.16 Separate models were run with
BMI entered in place of waist circumference as a measure of
obesity. There was no change in the main results, so only the
waist circumference findings are reported here. Clinical risk
factors included laboratory or physical findings available
from the NHANES survey that have been associated with
increased mortality in clinical trials and population-based
studies: blood pressure, lipid levels (triglyceride, total choles-
terol and HDL) and C-reactive protein (CRP), a measure of
systemic inflammation that has been associated with both
CVD and cardiovascular events.17 Analyses were also done
including calculated non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol ­
HDL cholesterol) and the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol
ratio without changes in the results reported here.
Category cut-off values and additional information on all
covariates included in our model are summarized in online
Supplementary material Appendix S1.
Logistic regression was used to determine P-values for
individual covariates, and odds ratios within the model
(outcome: mortality) were obtained using SUDAAN PROC
RLOGIST. The C-statistic was calculated for each model
across the disease states. The C-statistic is used to measure
the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve, measuring the ability of each model to discriminate
mortality outcomes (death/no death) and to evaluate the
model's practical ability for correctly discriminating a sub-
ject's outcome. Values vary between 0.5 and 1.0; an area of
0.5 indicates that the model performs as well as a coin toss.
All analyses were performed using SAS-Callable SUDAAN,
Version 9.0.0. All analyses incorporated sampling weights

based estimates.
Results
Limiting our sample to NHANES III participants aged 18
years and more (n ¼ 19 136) with valid strata, PSU, weight
and mortality responses yielded a sample size of 17 413,
which represented 91% of the eligible population. Our
disease subpopulation classifications showed 1241 (7.1%) sub-
jects in the diabetic population, 2281 (12.0%) in the CVD
population, 708 (4.7%) in the chronic non-CVD disease
population and 13 183 (78.6 %) in the no chronic disease or
healthy population. Subjects' demographic characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. The population was 52.3% female
with a mean age, at survey, of 45.3 (0.43) years. Responders
under the age of 25 represented 10% of our population while
another 10% of the population was 70 years or older. The
study sample was predominantly white and privately insured.
Over half of the sample had a waist circumference that met
the criteria for obesity and just under one-third were active
smokers at the initial interview. Most did not meet the CDC
recommendations for physical activity. The overall weighted
mortality rate was 9.5%. Self-reported global fair or poor
health was associated with higher mortality (OR ¼ 2.90; 95%
CI 2.45­3.42) relative to those in good or excellent health.
When stratified by self-reported diseases, the weighted mor-
tality was 33.5% for diabetics (OR ¼ 3.27; 95% CI 2.66­
4.02), 15.3% for those with CVD (OR ¼ 1.32; 95% CI
1.09­1.60), and 12.7% for those with non-CVD chronic dis-
eases (OR ¼ 1.44; 95% CI 1.15­1.80), when compared with
7.0% for those with no chronic diseases.
The results of individual analyses for each risk factor,
adjusted for age, gender and self-reported health status are
summarized in the first column of Table 2. Since the SES
variables have multiple classification levels, the overall
P-value for the variable, e.g. `race', is also shown. All of the
individual SES variables were significant predictors of mor-
tality at the overall level, with black race and public insurance
(either Medicare or Medicaid) associated with higher mor-
tality. Higher education levels and higher family incomes
were associated with lower mortality. In terms of health
behaviors, being a smoker or physically inactive was associ-
ated with higher mortality but waist circumference was not.
Among the clinical factors, elevated blood pressure, high tri-
glyceride levels and elevated CRP levels were associated with
higher mortality whereas total cholesterol and HDL levels
were not.
When all of the covariates were entered simultaneously
into a multivariable logistic regression for the full study
population, race, insurance coverage and income remained
statistically significant, but years of education did not
(Table 2). The model was tested for collinearity and over-
specification without evidence of either in the specifications
presented. Black race was not statistically associated with
mortality after controlling for the other covariates while
other race remained associated with lower mortality. Income
showed a graded response with higher incomes correlated
with lower mortality. Health behaviors remained significant

known chronic diseases (healthy). Stratifying the population
by the four chronic disease groups led to somewhat differ-
ent results. Table 3 shows the impact of SES risk factor for
respondents in each of the four health categories. The
overall P-values show the simultaneous impact of each indi-
vidual risk factor in a model adjusting for all other covari-
ates including behavioral and clinical risk factors. P-values
that were not significant at the 5% level are not shown.
Race is significant in two disease groups, driven by a lower
mortality rate for other race in each population. The impact
of insurance on mortality decreases across the populations,
having its strongest association in the healthy population.
The protective effect of income is seen in three of the
population groups but not in diabetics. Years of education
consistently do not predict subsequent mortality. For the
SES variables in general, there is a somewhat graded
response with the strongest effects seen in the healthy
group, intermediate effects in the chronic disease groups
and smallest effects in the diabetic group.
Table 4 shows the multivariable associations for behavioral
and clinical risk factors. As in Table 3, the values associated
with each risk factor are adjusted for all other covariates,
including SES. Smoking was associated with higher mortality
in all disease groups except diabetics. Waist circumference
was not significant except in the healthy population where it
was paradoxically associated with lower mortality. Low rates
of physical activity were associated with higher mortality in
diabetics and in chronic non-CVD subjects. Clinical risk
factors had a variable pattern across disease states. Both elev-
ated blood pressure and high CRP were associated with
higher mortality in the healthy population. Only elevated tri-
glycerides were associated with increased mortality in dia-
betics while elevated cholesterol was paradoxically associated
with lower mortality. High CRP was the only significant clini-
cal risk factor in the CVD population.
Logistic regression modeling was then used to evaluate the
additive impact of the three different categories (SES, beha-
viors, clinical) on predicting mortality in each of the disease
subpopulations. All models included age (continuous),
gender and self-reported health status and covariates were
added in a block by category, for example, SES variables. All
covariates within each category were added irrespective of
whether they had been shown to be statistically significant in
the bivariate or multivariable analysis. The models consist-
ently identified mortality more precisely in the healthy popu-
lation (C-statistic ¼ 0.862 for SES predictors) than in
diabetics (C-statistic ¼ 0.713 for SES predictors). However,
each of the three categories of risk factors correctly indicated
similar proportions of mortality within each disease state.
For example, in the diabetic population, the respective

C-statistics for SES, behaviors and clinical risk factors were
0.713, 0.707 and 0.695. The highest C-statistic in each
disease group was generated by the model containing all
possible covariate groups. The C-statistics for every model
are shown in online Supplementary material Appendix S2.
Finally, to address concerns that a portion of subjects who
were at high risk for mortality across all factors could be
driving the results, we investigated the degree of overlap
between SES, behavioral and clinical high-risk groups. On
the basis of the individual risk factors that were statistically
significant in the bivariate analysis, we considered `high-risk
SES' to be subjects in both the lowest income and education
level; `high-risk behavior' were subjects who were active
smokers with inadequate physical activity levels, and `high-
risk clinical' were subjects with abnormal triglycerides, CRP
and blood pressure. Only 0.11% of the overall population
fell simultaneously into all three high-risk groups. This pro-
portion ranged from a high of 0.42% in diabetics to a low of
0.06% in the healthy population. Using a less conservative
assumption, only 0.39% of the overall population fell into
the high-risk SES and one other high-risk group. This pro-
portion ranged from a low of 0.12% in the chronic disease
population to a high of 2.16% in the diabetic population.
Discussion
Main findings of this study
SES, health behaviors and clinical risk factors were each sig-
nificantly associated with mortality in the overall population
even when simultaneously adjusting for all of the other risk
factors. Race, insurance coverage and income were associated
with mortality even when controlling for age, health status
and behavioral and clinical risk factors. Smoking and low
levels of physical activity were also significantly associated
with mortality. Of the clinical risk factors, elevated blood
pressure and CRP were independently associated with mor-
tality. In multivariable models stratified by disease state, the
effect of SES and behavioral risk factors remained strong
across disease groups. SES risk factors (race, insurance and
income) were most strongly associated with mortality in the
healthy population but did affect mortality in populations with
chronic disease. Smoking was the strongest behavioral risk
factor associated with mortality across the disease groups
while inadequate physical activity was associated with mor-
tality in chronic disease populations. Clinical risk factors had a
less consistent pattern across disease groups. Elevated blood
pressure and CRP were associated with mortality in the
healthy population while only elevated triglycerides were
associated with higher mortality in the diabetic population.
Although each group of individual risk factors (SES, beha-
vioral, clinical) was statistically significantly associated with
mortality, when added together, they improved little upon the
ability of each separate category to predict overall mortality.
What is already known on this topic
A wealth of research has shown that SES, health behaviors and
clinical risk factors individually contribute toward mortality. In
the majority of the literature, however, these three domains
have been examined separately. Whereas studies of biochemical
markers and other clinical factors have predominantly focused

236 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
on high-risk populations receiving medical care, research on
SES and health behaviors have primarily examined healthier,
population-based samples. Few studies have attempted to
measure the relative contributions of each of these risk factors
on all-cause mortality in the same sample.
What this study adds
This study's findings corroborate previous longitudinal studies,
showing that SES is a powerful predictor of future mortality.
The relationship between SES factors and mortality is
complex, with many studies showing a higher burden of
disease, impaired functional status and risky health behaviors
in many low SES populations.6,18­20 However, in this study,
the relationship between measures of SES and mortality
remained the same after controlling for self-reported global
health, known clinical risk factors, pre-existing disease and
health behaviors. Of note, controlling for other factors elimi-
nated the higher mortality associated with black race in the
bivariate analysis while a lower mortality rate for those of
other ethnicity remained the same. Previous studies have
found that SES differences do explain some of the ethnic dis-
parities in health outcomes. A study of stroke risk factors
found that ethnic disparities in stroke prevalence persisted
after accounting for clinical risk factors, but the disparity dis-
appeared after controlling for income.21 A lower mortality rate
for Hispanics has been noted before and referred to by some
investigators as the `Hispanic paradox' or the `healthy immi-
grant effect'.20 The protective effect of higher incomes on
mortality was consistent across all population groups except
diabetics. This is consistent with previous studies showing that
income has a protective effect on mortality that is independent
of educational attainment.22 Other studies have explored the
education­health and income­health interactions in the USA,
demonstrating that investments in education and poverty relief
programs could have profound impacts on the health of the
nation.1,6 In diabetic respondents, the marginal effect of
income may be dwarfed by the impact of the disease itself on
mortality. In terms of predictive ability, it is interesting that
SES characteristics were at least as strong as the behavioral
and clinical risk factors included in this study even among
respondents with known CVD or diabetes. This argues that
SES factors remain powerful determinants of individual mor-
tality and should not be ignored as scientific advances identify
new and promising biologic predictors of clinical disease. The
ability to realize the benefits of early detection and treatment
are critically dependent upon knowledge about, access to and
the affordability of health care.
Despite statistical significance, there was only modest
improvement in discriminative ability as measured by the
C-statistic when additional risk factors were added to the
multivariable model. This is likely because a risk factor that
performs well as a prognostic test for an individual patient
must have a cutoff value that will discriminate between
those who will and those who will not develop the disease
with high sensitivity and specificity. One estimate is that a
risk factor must be so strongly associated with a disease that
the relative risk approaches 200 in order for it to be worth-
while for use as a screening test.23 Few available biomarkers
and none of the predictors included in this study perform at
that level.3,4 In cross-sectional population studies, the pro-
portion of variance in mortality that can be explained is
likely to be limited, and the ability to predict mortality will
quickly reach an asymptote.
Waist circumference and cholesterol measures (HDL and
total cholesterol) were generally not significantly associated
with mortality. This may be in part due to what is referred
to as the `Obesity paradox',24 which suggests that obese
patients tend to receive better medical treatment and man-
agement because their health risks seem more obvious.
Previous studies have shown occasional inconsistencies in
the association of both obesity and cholesterol measures
with cardiovascular events or mortality.25 ­ 28
Limitations of this study
These analyses have several limitations that must be noted.
The main outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The
large number of missing causes of death precluded sub-
group analyses by cause of death. Second, only a limited
number of SES, behavioral and clinical variables were avail-
able for analysis in each of the domains. Simultaneous ana-
lyses of variables across domains are a unique contribution
of this project, but further studies with more detailed vari-
ables and specifications are needed to explore causality and
the mediating aspects of each of these domains on risk
factors and outcomes. Third, ascertainment of SES, clinical
factors and health behaviors was cross-sectional at the time
of initial interview. These characteristics may change over
time and thus our results may underestimate the impact of
any of these factors on mortality. Future studies should
address the impact of risk factor trajectories and their
impact on mortality completely.18,29 Finally, only 6­12 years
of mortality follow-up was available for this study. Longer
follow-up might offer additional insights.
Conclusions
The results suggest that SES factors, behaviors and known
clinical risk factors all contribute significantly to subsequent
PREDICTING MORTALITY 237
mortality even when baseline health status and known chronic
diseases are taken into account. Despite accelerating scientific
advances, our ability to identify clinical risk factors and trans-
late that knowledge into improved health is likely to remain
dependent in part on successful maintenance of healthy beha-
viors as well as the accessibility of appropriate health care.
