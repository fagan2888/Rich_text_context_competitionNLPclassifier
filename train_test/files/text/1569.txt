water in the adult US population--nutritional, meal pattern, and body
weight correlates: National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys

ABSTRACT
Background: There is a surprising paucity of studies that have
systematically examined the correlates of water intake in the US
population.
Objective: The objective was to examine the association of con-
tributors of water intake with dietary characteristics, meal consump-
tion, and body weight in the US population.
Design: We used 24-h dietary recall data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004 (n =
12,283) and the NHANES 2005­2006 (n = 4112) to examine the
independent association of intakes of plain water, beverage mois-
ture, food moisture, and total water with sociodemographic factors,
dietary characteristics (energy, nutrients, diet quality, and energy
density), and meal patterns (number of eating episodes, mention
of breakfast or snack) by using multiple regression methods.
Results: In 2005­2006, American adults reported consuming
3.18 L of total water within the previous 24 h (in 1999­2004, esti-
mated total water intake was 3.35 L), with plain water and bever-
ages contributing 33% and 48% of the total, respectively. Plain
water intake was unrelated to the intake of energy and body mass
index but was positively related to dietary fiber and inversely related
to beverages, sugars, and the energy density of foods; these associ-
ations were in the opposite direction for beverage moisture intake.
Total water intake was inversely related to energy from fat and energy
density but positively related to dietary fiber, caffeine, alcohol, and
diet quality. The number of eating episodes predicted higher bever-
age and food moisture and total water intakes. A higher body mass
index predicted higher intakes of beverage moisture and total water.
Conclusion: Various contributors of total water intake differed in
their association with dietary characteristics and body weight in the
adult US population. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;90:655­63.
INTRODUCTION
Water, an essential nutrient, has well-recognized metabolic
and functional sequelae with even short-term deprivation; ad-
verse consequences from excessive water intake also are a pos-
sibility (1). The panel on Dietary Reference Intakes for
Electrolytes and Water in its 2004 report established the first
reference intake (ie, for Adequate Intake) for total water on the
basis of self-reported dietary data from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994) (1). In its report,
the expert panel also identified several gaps in the published
information about water intake, including the association of
water intake profiles with diet and meal patterns (1).
As reviewed by Valtin (2), despite popular beliefs about the
importance of drinking 8 cups of water a day and the supposed
benefits of water intake in body weight management, there is
a surprising paucity of systematic studies in this area. A number
of individual characteristics--eg, age, dietary sodium and protein
intake, and physical activity--are known to affect water
requirements (1), yet little is known about whether self-reported
water intake is related to variations in these factors. Given the
interest in understanding the association (if any) of water intake
with a variety of health outcomes, including various cancers and
coronary heart disease (1), understanding correlates of water
intake in a free-living population can help in the identification of
population subgroups that may benefit from interventions.
Although a number of studies have examined the nutritional
correlates of the consumption of beverages, especially sweetened
beverages(3­7),similarinformationinrelationtoplainwaterortotal
water intake is scarce (8­10). In an attempt to fill in these gaps in
knowledge, we used recent nationally representative data to ex-
amine: 1) the sociodemographic and lifestyle correlates of intakes
of plain water, moisture in foods and beverages, and total water and
2) the association of plain water and moisture intake with reported
dietary characteristics and meal patterns of US adults.

2002, 2003­2004, and 2005­2006, which were conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (11­14). Each survey was
a stratified, multistage, national probability sample of the civilian
noninstitutionalized population of the United States (11­14). The
survey procedures consisted of a household interview and
a health examination of the subject in the mobile examination
center. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, etc) and
an in-person interview to collect 24-h dietary recall were obtained
in the mobile examination center. All surveys used a computer-
assisted dietary interview for obtaining a multiple-pass dietary
recall. Beginning with the NHANES 2002, the dietary recall was
collected by using the automated multiple-pass method, which
was developed and validated by the US Department of Agri-
culture (12). Survey response rates for the individuals examined
at the mobile examination center for the c-NHANES 1999­2000,
2001­2002, 2003­2004, and 2005­2006 were 76%, 80%, 76%,
and 77%, respectively (11­14).
Plain water and moisture intake
In the 1999­2004 surveys, respondents were asked "How
much plain water did you drink yesterday?" after collection of the
24-h dietary recall (11­13). Information about the intake of plain
carbonated water was obtained as part of the 24-h recall in 1999­
2001 (11, 12); in 2002­2004, this information was obtained by
asking a separate question after the recall (12, 13). However, the
water intake (plain or carbonated) information in the 2005­2006
survey was collected by integrating water questions within the
24-h recall rather than after recall (14). (The reasons for changes
in the methodology for collection of plain water intake data
beginning in the 2005­2006 survey are not described in the
documentation.) Because of these methodologic differences in
how plain water information was collected beginning with the
2005­2006 survey, we combine data for 1999­2004, but present
2005­2006 data separately.
The public release data for the c-NHANES 1999­2006 include
variables for plain water and moisture content of all foods and
beverages reported in the recall. For each 24-h recall, we ex-
amined 4 different types of water variables for this study: 1)
intake of plain water (defined by the NCHS to include tap water,
water from a water cooler or drinking fountain, spring water, and
noncarbonated bottled water); 2) moisture in foods reported in
the 24-h recall; 3) moisture in beverages reported in the 24-h
recall; and 4) total water intake (the sum of plain water and
moisture in foods and beverages). We considered all types of
liquid milk, shakes, fruit or vegetable juices, juice drinks, car-
bonated and noncarbonated sweetened or unsweetened drinks,
coffee, tea, hot chocolate, all alcoholic drinks, and carbonated
water as beverages. For the 1999­2004 surveys, we created the
total moisture variable as described above; for the 2005­2006
survey, we used the equivalent variable created by the NCHS
and available in the public release data set. In all surveys, we
included plain carbonated water in the beverages category.
Analytic sample
c-NHANES 1999­2004
All respondents aged 20 y with a dietary recall considered
complete and reliable by the NCHS were eligible for inclusion
in this study (n = 13,431). We excluded recalls of pregnant and
lactating women (n = 843), recalls from proxies (n = 270), re-
ports of 0 calories (n = 2), and recalls of those missing in-
formation on water intake in the previous 24 h (n = 33) from the
eligible sample. With these exclusions, the final analytic sample
included 12,283 men and women.
c-NHANES 2005­2006
In this survey, there were 4520 respondents aged 20 y with
a reliable recall. After exclusions for pregnancy/lactating state
(n = 353), recall from proxies (n = 54), and reports of 0 calories
(n = 1), the final analytic sample included 4112 men and
women.
Dietary and meal pattern variables examined
We examined the self-reported 24-h intakes of dietary energy,
fat, carbohydrate, total sugars, added sugars, as well as dietary
variables identified as determinants of water requirements in the
Institute of Medicine report (protein, fiber, sodium, caffeine, and
24-h alcohol) in relation to all water and moisture intake variables
operationalized in this study. The "added sugars" variable was
created by merging the NHANES 1999­2004 data with the
MyPyramid Equivalents Database of the US Department of
Agriculture (15, 16). We also assessed the energy density of foods
only (plain water or beverages reported in the recall were not
included in this estimation) as kilocalories per gram of reported
foods. By using the methods described previously (17), we
created variables to assess meal patterns; these variables included
the number of eating episodes, mention of breakfast and any
snack in the recall, and the percentage of recalled intake re-
portedly consumed after 1700 h. In addition, we assessed the
association of all water intake variables with a simple measure of
overall diet quality, which assessed the diet for variety among
food groups (mention of at least one food from each of the major
5 food groups--dairy, fruit, vegetable, grain, and meat or al-
ternative in the recall). We have previously used this simple
indicator of diet quality in relation to dietary nutrient intake and
mortality as outcome (18, 19). Finally, where available
(NHANES 1999­2002), we examined the association of water
intake variables with the Healthy Eating Index (20). The Healthy
Eating Index is a complex measure of diet quality created by the
US Department of Agriculture to assess concurrence with the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans (21).
Analytic methods
We used multiple linear regression methods to compute
covariate adjusted means (ie, predicted margins) of all water
intake variables separately for the c-NHANES 1999­2004 and
2005­2006. The covariates included sex, age, race-ethnicity,
body mass index, poverty-income ratio, years of education,
smoking status, day of diet recall, leisure-time physical activity,
average daily physical activity, any self-reported chronic disease,
and survey wave (in analyses that included combined
c-NHANES 1999­2004). The adjusted means were computed
from covariate adjusted regression models by direct standardi-
zation of the means to the distribution of the covariates for the
combined US populations represented by the weighted NHANES
samples (22). We examined the association of dietary, meal

pattern, and body-weight-related variables with each contributor
of water intake as a dependent variable by adding the relevant
nutritional or meal pattern variable to the multiple linear re-
gression models. For dietary variables such as energy or nutrient
intake, we present the regression coefficient and its SE to reflect
the predicted change in reported water and moisture intakes for
a given change in energy or nutrient intakes as independent
variables. Similarly, for associations of meal patterns with water
and moisture intake, we present the associated regression co-
efficient, its SE, and the P value. We present these associations
by using regression models with and without energy adjustment.
Low-energy reporting has been reported as a problem in national
surveys including the NHANES (23). Low-energy reporting
may affect the ability to detect associations of dietary intake
exposures with weight-related outcomes. We examined low-
energy reporting in the present study by computing the ratio of
reported energy intake to the estimated basal energy expenditure
by using the sex-specific equation recommended by the Dietary
Reference Intake committee (24). For weight-related outcomes,
we present estimates of association that include the ratio of
energy intake to basal energy expenditure as an independent
variable. Respondents with complete information on all co-
variates were included in multivariate regression models.
All statistical analyses were performed by using SAS (version
9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and software designed for the
analysis of complex survey data (SAS-callable SUDAAN, ver-
sion 9) (25). SUDAAN software computes variance estimates
that are corrected for the multistage, stratified, cluster probability
design of complex surveys. Sample weights provided by the
NCHS to account for differential probabilities of selection,
noncoverage, and nonresponse were used in all analyses to obtain
point estimates. All reported P values for testing for significant
association from regression models used the F-statistic with
a Satterthwaite correction for the df (26).
RESULTS
This article presents results from the c-NHANES 2005­2006
and notes the different associations between the combined 1999­
2004 surveys and the 2005­2006 survey. Results from the c-
NHANES 1999­2004 are available under "Supplemental data" in
the online supplement.
Sociodemographic and lifestyle correlates of contributors
of water intake in 2005­2006
Men reported higher adjusted amounts of moisture in bev-
erages, foods, and total water (but not plain water) (P , 0.0001)
(Table 1). The reported plain water intakes did not differ among
race-ethnic groups; however, race-ethnicity was a significant
correlate of reported intakes of moisture in foods and beverages
and total water. The self-reported plain water, beverage mois-
ture, and total water declined with increasing age (P  0.003).
Higher education was associated with higher self-reported plain
water and food moisture intakes (P  0.003). Current smokers
had a lower intake of moisture in foods (P = 0.0002), but
a higher intake of beverages and total water (P  0.0003). Any
leisure-time physical activity was associated with higher intakes
of plain and total water; higher average activity on a typical day
was a correlate of a higher amount of moisture from beverages
and total water. Body mass index (BMI) showed positive asso-
ciations with beverage moisture and total water (P  0.01).
Reported food moisture was higher on weekdays than on
weekends (P = 0.006).
In the c-NHANES 1999­2004, higher plain water intake was
reported by men, those with a higher BMI, and in association with
higher average daily physical activity (see Supplement Table 1
under "Supplemental data" in the online issue). Years of edu-
cation were unrelated to plain water intake.
Association of contributors of water intake with intake of
dietary nutrients and other dietary components reported in
the 24-h recall in 2005­2006
The plain water intake was positively associated with the
reported intake of moisture in foods but inversely associated with
beverage moisture intake (P , 0.0001) (Table 2). However, the
intakes of moisture in beverages and foods were unrelated (P .
0.05). Dietary energy intake was unrelated to plain water intake,
but was a positive correlate of the moisture content of foods,
beverages, and total water (P , 0.0001). Dietary protein (as
percentage of energy) was unrelated to total water and related
positively to plain water and food moisture intake but inversely
related to beverage moisture (P , 0.0001). Intakes of dietary fat
and carbohydrate (as percentage of energy) were inversely re-
lated to total water intake (P  0.007). Energy density (kilo-
calories per gram) of foods was an inverse correlate of plain
water, food moisture, and total water, but a positive correlate of
beverage moisture (P , 0.0001). Dietary fiber and sodium in-
takes were positively associated with all components of water
intake. The moisture content of beverages and total water were
positive correlates of 24-h caffeine and alcohol intakes. Total
sugars were inversely related to plain water intake (P = 0.04),
but positively related to moisture in foods and beverages and
total water (P  0.0001). With adjustment for energy intake, the
associations of these dietary variables with components of fluid
intake were generally attenuated, and sodium and total sugar
were not related to total water intake.
In the combined data from 1999 to 2004, the following as-
sociation differed from those mentioned above: food moisture
was unrelated to dietary fat, carbohydrate, and caffeine intake
(Supplemenetal Table 2 under "Supplemental data" in the online
issue). Intake of added sugar was inversely related to plain water,
but positively related to other water variables.
Meal pattern correlates of contributors of water intake
reported in the 24-h recall in 2005­2006
The number and amount of nonbeverage foods were positively
associated with all water variables except beverage moisture
(Table 3). The reported number of eating episodes, mention of
breakfast or a snack, and the percentage of 24-h energy con-
sumed after 1700 were not related to plain water intake (P .
0.05). The number of eating episodes and mention of a snack
were positive correlates of moisture in foods and beverages and
total water. Those who reported breakfast or a snack reported
higher moisture content of foods (P , 0.0001). Mention of all
5 food groups in the recall was associated with higher intake of
moisture in foods and total water (P  0.0003), but not with
plain water or beverage moisture. With energy adjustment, most

only for the number of eating episodes.
In the combined data from the c-NHANES 1999­2004, the
number and amount of nonbeverage foods showed a positive
association with beverage moisture, the percentage of energy
reported after 1700 h was a positive correlate of food moisture,
and mention of 5 food groups in the recall was a positive correlate
of plain water intake (see Supplemental Table 3 under "Sup-
plemental data" in the online issue). The Healthy Eating Index
was unrelated to plain water intake but predicted higher food
moisture and total water intake.

desire for weighing more, less, or the same was a weak correlate
of differences in intakes of plain water, beverage moisture, and
total water (P  0.03).
In the c-NHANES 1999­2004, with a few exceptions, nearly
all components of fluid intake were significant correlates of body-
weight-related variables (see Supplemental Table 4 under
"Supplemental data" in the online issue). Those who considered
themselves as overweight, had attempted weight loss in the
previous year, and expressed a desire to weigh less reported the
highest beverage moisture and total water intakes relative to
other categories of these variables.
DISCUSSION
In 2005­2006, of the 3.18 L (13.4 cups) total water (the sum of
plain water and moisture in foods and beverages) reported by
adult Americans over the previous 24 h, '33% was consumed as
plain water, 48% as beverages, and the remaining 18% as food.
The Dietary Reference Intake report on Water and Electrolytes
also estimated that 81% of the total water reported in the
NHANES III was contributed by plain water and beverages (1).
Relative to 2005­2006, the mean estimates of total water intake
in the c-NHANES 1999­2004 were higher by '177 mL. This
difference is largely because of a higher mean plain water intake
reported in 1999­2004. In 1999­2004, although the combined
intakes of plain water and beverages equaled '82%, the plain
water comprised a higher proportion of the total ('37%). The
extent to which these differences reflect different methods for
collecting plain water intake data in these surveys (integrated in
the 24-h recall in 2005­2006 and a separate question after recall
in 1999­2004) is not known.
Our results suggest that population characteristics (age, edu-
cation, and leisure physical activity) that usually correlate with
better dietary outcomes were related to plain water intake in the

expected direction. Relative to other smoking categories, current
smokers had the highest total water intake, largely because of
higher beverage moisture, given that the plain water and food
water intakes among smokers were lower. De Castro and Taylor
(10) have also reported higher beverage intake in smokers.
Notably, both leisure and average daily physical activity were
associated with total water intake; however, the association
reflected higher plain water intake by those reporting any leisure
activity, but higher beverage intake by those reporting higher
average daily activity. Because fruits and vegetables are dietary
constituents with the highest water content, higher food moisture
intake (noted in association with higher education, never/former
smokers, and recalls on weekdays) may be interpreted as in-
dicating diets with likely contributions of these desirable food
groups. Arguably, higher food moisture intake may also reflect
higher food quantity intake; however, the observed associations
remained unchanged by adjustment for energy intake (related to
amount of food). (Energy-adjusted estimates are not shown in
Table 1 but are available from the authors.)
The inverse association of plain water intake with beverage
moisture but positive association with moisture in foods suggests
some substitution effect of plain water intake on beverage
consumption and possibly higher fruit and vegetable intake.
Although these associations may be expected to affect energy
intake, we found plain water and energy intake to be unrelated in
all surveys. Popkin et al (8) have reported lower energy intake in
association with plain water intake. We caution that these
comparisons are problematic because the analysis in the above
study used a different definition of water and compared plain
water reporters and nonreporters, and the reported findings ap-
pear to be unadjusted for confounding due to factors related to
energy and water intake. Nevertheless, the associations of the
intake of plain water with dietary fiber intake (positive), energy
density of foods, and total and added sugars (inverse) do suggest
different dietary selections in relation to plain water intake. Other
dietary characteristics examined in this study (intakes of protein,
dietary fiber, sodium, caffeine, and alcohol) were discussed in the
Institute of Medicine report as possible determinants of water
requirements (1). All of these variables (except dietary protein
intake and sodium intakes) showed positive associations with
total water intake with and without adjustment for energy intake
in our study. To our knowledge, there is no published information
on these associations to allow comparisons.
Surprisingly, few studies have examined the association of
dietary sodium intake with components of water intake (27, 28).
A recent study has suggested that the association of sodium intake
with the intake of sweetened beverages may be a mechanism for
inducing positive energy balance with consequent weight gain
in children (29). However, in the present study, with adjustment
for energy intake--although sodium intake remained a positive
correlate of food moisture--the association with beverage
moisture became inverse, and the overall association with
total water intake was no longer significant. These observa-
tions suggest that sodium and total water intake association
may largely reflect the association of food quantity and sodium
intake.
The associations of reported meal patterns (number of eating
episodes, mention of breakfast or snack in the recall, and extent of
energy consumed in the evening) with plain water intake were
generally unremarkable. Other significant associations of meal

patterns with food, beverage, and total water were not observed
after adjustment for energy intake.
Although the possibility and extent of water-induced ther-
mogenesis and its potential importance in weight management
remains controversial (30, 31), consumption of plain water is
promoted in most sensible weight management plans. In the
present study, beverage moisture and total water intake increased
with increasing BMI in all surveys; however, the association of
plain water intake with BMI and weight-related variables (history
of attempted weight loss in the previous year and desire to weigh
less) were noted in 1999­2004 but not in 2005­2006. Whether
these differences reflect different methods for collection of plain
water information in 1999­2004 compared with 2005­2006 is not
known.
Increasing consumption of sweetened beverages has been
suggested as a potential contributor to higher energy intake with
consequent weight gain in the US population (5, 32). Moreover,
there is evidence that the satiating effect of beverages is lower
than that of solid foods with possibly poor regulation of the
resulting liquid energy intake (33). As expected, we observed an
inverse association of food moisture with the energy density of
foods (34). However, our results indicate that plain water and
beverage consumption had a divergent association with the en-
ergy density of foods reported in the recall with plain water
predicting lower energy density and beverage intake predicting
higher energy density of foods, which suggests that another
mechanism for higher energy intakes (beverage consumption)
operates in association with high-energy density diets.
Because of within-person variability in food intake, a single
24-h dietary recall is not suitable for determining usual intake
distributions (24); therefore, we do not attempt to describe usual
intake distributions of various contributors of daily water intake.
We present population means and standard errors (for which
a 24-h recall provides an unbiased estimate) for the various water
variables and, when we examine associations, they are within the
context of the 24-h recall. Measurement error, especially the
misreporting of energy intake, is an acknowledged problem in all
dietary assessment methods (24). Although the use of automated
multiple-pass methods to obtain the 24-h dietary recall is an
improvement over older methods of collecting recalls, under-
reporting of energy intake, especially in association with body
weight, remains a problem (35). In a study of the sources of
reporting errors in the automated multiple-pass method, bev-
erages and vegetables were the largest contributors to energy
reporting bias in highly educated lean men (36). Although our
analyses were adjusted for subject characteristics (such as body
weight, level of education, and income) with known associations
with reporting errors, we acknowledge that it is likely that
beverage moisture, food moisture, and total water intake may be
underestimated in our study. Finally, although our study provides
estimates of various contributors to total water intake adjusted for
multiple covariates, the NHANES public release data do not
include information on geographic location and season of exam.
We expect geographic location and season of exam to be highly
correlated in the NHANES data. We note that an analysis of the
Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals 1994­1996
data found relatively little seasonal variation in water intake
among adults (37).
In conclusion, our results suggest that contributors of total
water vary with respect to the sociodemographic and lifestyle
characteristics of the US population and in association with
selected dietary characteristics. Given the divergent associations
of plain water compared with beverage moisture intakes with
dietary energy, fiber, sugars, and energy density, the study pro-
vides evidence to encourage water intake over beverages and
attests to the need to examine contributors of water along with
total water intake.
