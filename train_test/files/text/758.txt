Information from pension providers was examined to investigate gender differences in
pension wealth at midlife. For full-time wage and salary workers approaching retirement
age who had pension coverage, median pension wealth on the current job was 76% greater
for men than women. Differences in wages, years of job tenure, and industry between men
and women accounted for most of the gender gap in pension wealth on the current job.
Less than one third of the wealth difference could not be explained by gender differences in
education, demographics, or job characteristics. The less-advantaged employment situation
of working women currently in midlife carries over into worse retirement income
prospects. However, the gender gap in pensions is likely to narrow in the future as married
women's employment experiences increasingly resemble those of men.

Gender Differences in Pension Wealth:
Estimates Using Provider Data
Richard W. Johnson, PhD,1 Usha Sambamoorthi, PhD,2 and Stephen Crystal,
Pension benefits from past employers are an im-
portant source of retirement income. In 1994, annual
private pension income averaged $4,330 among eld-
erly pension recipients, accounting for 24% of their
household income (Grad, 1996). For persons nearing
retirement in 1992, pension wealth, defined as the
present value of the stream of future expected pen-
sion benefits, equaled 23% of total household wealth,
almost as large as the share of total wealth attribut-
able to future Social Security benefits (Custman, Mit-
chell, Samwick, & Steinmeier, 1997). Pensions have
also been growing in importance over time. For ex-
ample, in 1990, 30% of elderly couples and single
persons received income from private pensions, com-
pared to only 20% in 1976 (Reno, 1993). If the in-
crease in private pension receipt continues, and if bud-
getary pressures on the Social Security system limit the
generosity of public pensions, then private pensions
are likely to become an even more significant source
of income for upcoming generations of retirees.
An important concern for pension policy is the un-
equal distribution of benefits. In 1993, for example,
only 56% of full-time wage and salary workers were
covered by a pension plan on their current job (U.S.
Department of Labor, 1994). Workers with pension
coverage tend to be economically advantaged in other

ways as well. For example, covered workers are pre-
dominantly White and well educated, work for large,
unionized firms, and earn high wages (e.g, Turner &
Beller, 1992; U.S. Department of Labor, 1994; Woods,
1989). Gustman and colleagues (1997) concluded that
accumulated pension wealth among persons aged 51
to 61 was more unequally distributed than overall
household wealth, which itself is known to follow a
very skewed distribution. The unequal distribution of
pension income may be responsible in part for the
greater inequality in income observed in later life than
at younger ages (Crystal & Shea, 1990; Crystal &
Waehrer, 1996).
Differences in pension wealth are especially pro-
nounced between men and women. Among full-time
private sector workers, only 43% of women had pen-
sion coverage on their current job in 1988, compared
with 50% of men (Korczyk, 1992). Gender differences
appear to be even larger among retirees and persons
nearing retirement. For example, within a sample of
new Social Security beneficiaries in 1982 who had
some work experience since 1950, 66% of men but
only 36% of women received private pension income;
among pension recipients, the mean pension benefit
for women was only 55% as large as the mean ben-
efit for men (Even & Macpherson, 1994). McGarry
and Davenport (1998) found that 82% of men be-
tween the ages of 51 and 61 in 1992 were either
receiving pension income or expected to receive
benefits in the future from a current or past job, com-
pared with only 52% of women. Moreover, for indi-
viduals with current or expected pension benefits, they
estimated that pension wealth was 40% greater for
men than for women. McGarry and Davenport's esti-
mates were based on self-reports of expected future
benefits, which may not be very accurate because
many people have only limited knowledge of the de-
tails of their pension plans (Mitchell, 1988). Gustman
320 The Gerontologist
and colleagues (1997) analyzed detailed pension plan
information collected from pension providers and
reached similar conclusions: Among married persons
aged 51 to 61 in 1992, women's mean pension wealth
was only one fourth as large as men's.
Although the existence of gender differences in pen-
sion wealth is well established, the underlying causes
of the differential are less well understood. Women
may accumulate less pension wealth than men for a
number of different reasons. In virtually all pension
plans, benefits are based on past earnings and time
spent on the job. In traditional defined benefit plans,
pension income is generally computed as a specified
fraction of some measure of final earnings times years
of job tenure. In defined contribution plans, where
future benefits are determined by the amount of
funds that have accumulated in the worker's individual
account, account balances typically increase over time
while plan contributions from both employers and em-
ployees generally increase with wages. Thus in both
types of plans, men with higher earnings and more
years of job experience would receive higher benefits
than women with lower earnings and fewer years of
seniority.
Women may also be sorted into jobs that offer low
pension benefits. Defined benefit plans often impose
financial penalties for leaving employment before re-
tirement, because benefits are generally based on
a nominal measure of final earnings, which erodes
in value with inflation. Firms may backload compen-
sation in this way until the end of the career as a
means of reducing turnover and the hiring and train-
ing costs associated with it (Allen, Clark, & McDermed,
1993; Gustman & Steinmeier, 1993; Johnson, 1996;
see Appendix, Note 1). Firms may also offer pensions
as a means of eliciting effort from workers when
monitoring performance is difficult, because workers
who are caught shirking and are fired would forfeit
the generous pension benefits they would have other-
wise earned near the end of the career (Lazear, 1979).
Women, however, may avoid jobs that backload
compensation with defined benefit plans if they
anticipate that child-rearing responsibilities will leaa
to intermittent work histories. Similarly, firms may
avoid hiring women for jobs with substantial specific
training requirements, which often offer generous
pension plans (Johnson, 1996), because women tend
to have higher turnover rates than men (see Appen-
dix, Note 2).
Previous studies have highlighted the importance
of earnings differences between men and women in
explaining the gender gap in pensions. Even and Mac-
pherson (1994) found that about one half of the
differential in pension benefits, among pension recipi-
ents, was attributable to the relatively low earnings
of women on their longest career job. Differences in
job tenure, total labor market experience, full-time
status, education, industry, and occupation explained
little of the gender gap. However, since Even and
Macpherson's (1994) findings were based on a sample
of persons who retired in 1982, it is unclear how well
they describe pension differences among workers
currently in the labor force. The patterns of pension
income received by women who retired 15 years ago
may differ substantially from the patterns that will be
observed for the next cohort of retirees, because of
the dramatic changes in the labor market experiences
of married women that have occurred over the past
30 years. In addition, to compare the level of pension
benefits that men and women earn in the labor mar-
ket, it may be preferable to study a sample of current
workers approaching retirement rather than a sample
of retirees. Although information on pension income
received by retirees can offer insights into questions
about the adequacy of pension income, it does not
necessarily offer the best data to investigate how the
labor market compensates workers in the form of pen-
sion benefits. Gender differences in pension income
received during retirement do not always reflect dif-
ferences in pension wealth earned on the job. For
example, retirement income depends in part on a num-
ber of factors that do not affect expected pension
wealth earned on the current job, including the age
at which persons choose to begin receiving pension
income, the way in which they choose to receive
pensions (as a single annuity instead of a joint life
annuity, for instance), and the amount of benefits re-
ceived earlier in the life course as lump sum distribu-
tions from retirement plans.
This article investigates gender differences in pen-
sion coverage and pension wealth on the current job
for a sample of workers approaching retirement and
the factors responsible for the differentials between
men and women. The gender gap in pension wealth
has important policy significance, because it may con-
tribute to the very high rates of poverty among di-
vorced and widowed women at older ages (Hurd &
Wise, 1989). Large differences in pension wealth
between men and women may also exacerbate the
well-known gender inequalities in wages (Blau, 1998).
To improve the accuracy of our estimates of pension
wealth, we utilized data collected from pension pro-
viders, which include detailed information about plan
provisions. We found that differences between men
and women in pension coverage on the current job
were small but significant in a sample of full-time workers
approaching retirement. However, gender differences
in pension wealth conditional on coverage were quite
large. Among full-time workers with coverage, median
pension wealth on the current job was 76% greater
for men than women. We found that most of the gen-
der gap in pension wealth could be attributed to
differences in wages, industry, and job experience be-
tween men and women.
Data
The data for our study came from the first wave of
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which is an
especially rich source of information on pension wealth
for a large sample of persons nearing retirement. Con-
ducted by the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the
University of Michigan, in 1992 the HRS interviewed
a nationally representative sample of men and women
aged 51 to 61 and their spouses (regardless of age)
Vol. 39, No. 3, 1999 321
and resurveyed them every two years. The baseline
survey gathered data on 12,652 persons in 7,702 house-
holds, including oversamples of Blacks, Hispanics, and
Florida residents. Information was collected on the in-
come, assets, employment history, health, demographics,
and family structure and financial transfers of the re-
spondents (see Juster & Suzman, 1995, for additional
information about the HRS).
HRS respondents were asked a detailed series of
questions about-their entitlements to future pension
benefits. Persons who reported being part of pension
or retirement plans sponsored by their employers or
unions were questioned about the number of plans
in which they were included, and for each plan they
were asked about plan type (defined benefit, defined
contribution, or some combination of the two), the
number of years they had participated in the plan,
the age at which they expected to begin receiving
benefits, and the amount they expected to receive at
that age. In addition, respondents with defined con-
tribution plans were asked about the balance in their
pension accounts and the amounts they and their em-
ployers each contribute to the plan. These data are
likely to provide reliable information on pension cov-
erage, because persons approaching retirement gen-
erally know whether they belong to pension plans.
However, it is less clear that respondents are able to
report accurately their future expected pension ben-
efits. For example, Mitchell (1988) found that many
persons do not have detailed knowledge of their pen-
sion plans.
Instead of basing our estimates of pension wealth
on questionable self-reported data, we used more re-
liable information collected from pension providers (see
Appendix, Note 3). Respondents who reported par-
ticipating in pension plans were asked to supply the
names and addresses of the employers (or unions) who
sponsored the plans. Summary plan descriptions, which
provide information about retirement ages, vesting re-
quirements, employee and employer contributions to
trie plan, cost of living adjustments, Social Security off-
sets, and the formulas with which pension benefits are
based, were then collected from the plan administra-
tors. Some descriptions were also gathered from records
at the U.S. Department of Labor when HRS staff were
unable to obtain information from employers.
Detailed pension information was collected for
3,834 persons, or about two thirds of the respondents
who reported pension coverage at Wave 1. An im-
portant limitation of the provider data is that HRS re-
spondents who were successfully linked with summary
plan descriptions do not represent a random sample
of respondents with pension coverage. Table 1 reports
the percentage of full-time workers in the HRS who
were linked to provider data among those who self-
reported pension coverage on the current job. We
found little variation in overall match rates by gender,
with 68% of covered male workers and 67% of cov-
ered female workers linked to provider data at Wave
1. However, the proportion of covered workers linked
to provider data varied substantially by plan type, firm
size, industry, wage, and education. For example, only
about 30% of respondents who participated only in

(aged 51-61) who were current full-time wage and salary workers
with pension coverage on the current job. Members of the Armed
Forces were excluded. The superscript w denotes statistically sig-

defined contribution plans and worked in firms with
fewer than 100 employees were successfully matched
with summary plan descriptions, compared to about
77% of respondents who participated only in defined
benefit plans and worked in firms with 500 or more
employees. Match rates were also quite high among
workers in public administration and the professional
services industry and among well-educated and high-
wage workers. For example, 95% of covered men and
92% of covered women working in public administra-
tion were linked to summary plan descriptions pro-
vided by their employers. Within subgroups, however,
gender differences in match rates were generally in-
significant.
322 The Gerontologist
We accounted for the overrepresentation of par-
ticular subgroups of covered workers in the pension
provider sample in two ways. First, we reweighted the
provider data so that the distribution of full-time
workers by firm size and plan type was consistent with
the observed distribution among full-time workers with
pension coverage in the full HRS sample. The weights
were computed as the ratio of the proportion of ob-
servations in the full HRS sample with a given plan
type and firm size to the proportion of observations
in the pension provider sample with the same pen-
sion plan and firm size. In both samples, the frequency
computations were restricted to full-time wage and
salary workers with pension coverage on the current
job. The largest sample weights were assigned to
workers in firms with fewer than 100 employees and
in defined contribution plans, who were assigned
weights of 2.15. The smallest weights, equal to 0.74,
were assigned to workers in firms with 500 or more
employees and in defined benefit plans. In the
weighted provider sample, the distribution of workers
by key characteristics, such as gender, education, race,
plan type, firm size, industry, occupation, job tenure,
and wage, was similar to the distribution of workers
who self-reported pension coverage in the first wave
of the HRS. Second, we accounted for the over-
representation of particular subgroups of covered
workers in the provider sample by applying standard
selection correction techniques to our multivariate
estimates, as described in the Methods section.
We restricted our sample to age-eligible respon-
dents who were employed full-time as wage and sal-
ary workers at the time of the survey. We eliminated
respondents younger than age 51 or older than age
61 because they were included in the survey only
because they were married to an age-eligible respon-
dent, and thus do not represent a random sample of
persons in their age group. We considered only full-
time workers because part-time workers in their fifties
may have already retired from their career jobs (Doe-
ringer, 1990), on which they earned the bulk of their
pension wealth. We also eliminated self-employed
workers because the determinants of compensation
may be quite different for them than for wage and
salary workers. Members of the Armed Forces were
dropped because we were concerned only with the
civilian labor market. Our final sample consisted of
2,483 men and 1,947 women, representing 55% of
the age-eligible men in the full HRS sample and 38%
of the age-eligible women. Our sample of respondents
with matched pension plan data, who were further
restricted to workers with pension plans on the cur-
rent job, included 1,230 men and 902 women.
Methods
To investigate gender differences in pensions earned
on the current job, we estimated probit models of
pension coverage and, for covered workers, linear re-
gression models of pension wealth. We also decom-
posed the gender gap in pension coverage and wealth
into the portions attributable to different worker and
job characteristics.
Computation of Pension Wealth
Software recently developed by ISR was used to
estimate pension wealth by combining information on
wages, years of service, and age with pension param-
eters (see Appendix, Note 4). For defined benefit plans,
real pension wealth was defined by Equation 1:
PW = [T x W x X - + /)-"?-a)
(1)
where T is completed years of job tenure at retire-
ment, W is the final wage base at retirement, expressed
in 1992 dollars, X is the plan-specific percentage fac-
tor, <
|
) is the reduction in pension benefits due to
Social Security integration, R is the retirement age, / is
the real interest rate, a is age in 1992, and aR
is a
function converting a one-dollar lifetime annuity into
its present value as of the retirement age.
The term in brackets in Equation 1 is the value of
nominal pension benefits that a worker participating
in the plan can expect to receive during the initial
year of retirement. Years of expected joo tenure T
was computed by taking the self-reported value of
tenure on the current job in 1992 and assuming that
workers remained with the employer until the assumed
retirement age. The definition of the final wage base
W varies by plan, and is specified in the summary
plan description. In some cases it may be defined as
the worker's average annual earnings over the entire
career, whereas in other cases it is defined as annual
earnings in the final year of employment; typically,
however, it is defined as average earnings over the
past three to five years. To compute the final wage
base at the time of retirement, the ISR program pro-
jected the current 1992 wage as reported by the re-
spondent forward to the assumed retirement age. Be-
cause real wages do not generally increase over time
for workers approaching retirement age (Custman &
Steinmeier, 1985; Johnson & Neumark, 1996), we as-
sumed that the rate of real increase for current earn-
ings was equal to the economy-wide growth in wages
and that real earnings did not change because of the
respondent's progression through the life course. The
percentage factor X, which was also taken from the
summary plan descriptions, is sometimes a step func-
tion of years of service or of earnings. For cases in
which the pension plan sets benefits equal to a fixed
amount per year of service, independent of earnings,
W in Equation 1 is set equal to unity and X is set
equal to the dollar amount per year of service. The
reduction factor <
|
> also takes different forms in differ-
ent plans. In some plans, it is equal to the total amount
of Social Security benefits the worker is expected to
receive at age 65, whereas in other £Jans it may be a
given fraction of the Social Security taxable wage base
times years of service, for example. Pension benefits,
and hence pension wealth, were zero when T was
less than the required number of years for vesting.
The nominal benefits calculated for the first year
of retirement are received annually for the remainder
of the retiree's life, although the size of the payment
may be subject to cost-of-living adjustments. The
annual benefit is converted into its annuity value
by the function aR
, shown in Equation 2.

where kt
is the COLA at age t, sRt
is the probability
of surviving from the retirement age to age t, n is the
change in the Consumer Price Index from period
t - 1 to t, and / is again the real interest rate. Survival
probabilities after retirement were tabulated sep-
arately for men and women. (All respondents were
assumed to survive with certainty until retirement.) The
value of kt
depends upon the inflationary environ-
ment and the COLA provisions of the specific pen-
sion plan, which were available from the summary plan
description. Real retirement benefits were further
discounted from the assumed retirement age to the
current age in 1992 by the real interest rate.
For defined contribution plans, pension wealth was
defined as the projected balance in the plan account
at the time individuals expect to retire, discounted to
1992 (the time of the survey). The account balance
depends upon the level of contributions to the plan
and the amount of interest earned on past contribu-
tions. Mandatory contributions, by both employers and
employees, were specified in the summary plan de-
scriptions. Information about additional voluntary con-
tributions by employees was reported by respondents
at the time of survey, and the level of voluntary con-
tributions was assumed to remain constant while the
respondent remained in the plan. Past contributions
were assumed to grow at the nominal rate of interest
for both men and women. Because there is some evi-
dence that women invest more conservatively and hence
earn lower returns than men (Bajtelsmit & Bernasek,
1996; Hinz, McCarthy, & Turner, 1997), our assump-
tion that past contributions grow at the same rate for
men and women may lead us to underestimate gen-
der differences in pension wealth.
The macroeconomic assumptions incorporated
into our estimates of pension wealth correspond to
the intermediate assumptions used by the Social Se-
curity Administration in 1996 for their assessment of
the financial condition of the Social Security trust fund
(U.S. Social Security Administration, 1996). The an-
nual inflation rate was assumed to equal 4.0%, the
real interest rate was assumed to equal 2.3%, and
wages were assumed to grow at a real annual rate of
1.0%. In addition, all workers were assumed to retire
and to begin receiving pension benefits at age 65.
Multivariate Estimates of Pension
Coverage and Pension Wealth
To identify the effects of worker and job charac-
teristics on pensions for men and women, we esti-
mated multivariate models of pension coverage and
pension wealth separately for men and women. The
pension coverage estimates were generated from probit
equations, in which the dependent variable was set
equal to one if the respondent reported being included
in a pension or retirement plan on the current job
sponsored by an employer or union, zero otherwise.
The pension wealth estimates were generated from
linear regression models, in which the dependent variable
was the natural log of pension wealth.
We attempted to correct our estimates of pension
wealth for the nonrandomness of the provider matches
by using standard sample selection adjustments (Heck-
man, 1979). We first estimated probit equations of
the probability of being linked to provider data, con-
ditional on self-reporting pension coverage, from which
we derived the inverse of Mills' Ratio. We then in-
cluded the inverse of Mills' Ratio as a regressor in the
pension wealth equations. (We included the same set
of regressors in the probit selection equations as in
the pension wealth regressions.) If unooservable fac-
tors affecting the probability of being linked to pro-
vider data are correlated with unobservable factors
affecting the level of pension wealth, then omitting
the inverse of Mills' Ratio from the pension wealth
regression could bias our estimated parameters in the
wealth equation. A drawback of this selection adjust-
ment is that it is quite sensitive to the way in which
the selection equation is specified. This lack of ro-
bustness suggests that the corrected estimates may not
be superior to the uncorrected estimates, and we re-
port both sets of estimates below.
In both the pension coverage and wealth models,
the covariates consisted of measures of education,
demographic characteristics, job experience, industry,
occupation, union membership, firm size, and wages,
plus an intercept term. Education was measured by a
series of dichotomous variables, indicating whether the
worker did not attend high school, attended some high
school but fewer than four years, completed exactly
four years of high school, or attended some college
but fewer than four years; college graduates were
the reference group. The models included an indica-
tor for race (non-White, with White as the reference
group) and two indicators for marital status (widowed,
divorced, or separated, and never married, with cur-
rently married as the reference group). Job tenure was
measured by a series of variables indicating 1 year or
less, more than 1 but no more than 5 years, more
than 5 but no more than 10 years, more than 10 but
no more than 15 years, and more than 15 but no
more than 20; the reference group was more than 20
years of job tenure. The model included six industry
controls, with manufacturing as the reference group,
five occupational controls, with managers as the refer-
ence group, and an indicator for being covered by a
union or employee-association contract. The effects
of firm size were captured by a series of variables in-
dicating the number of employees at all locations (un-
der 100 and 100-499, with 500 or more employees
as the reference group). The hourly wage entered the
model through indicator variables for earning $6 or
less, more than $6 but no more than $10, and more
than $10 but no more than $15; the reference group
was employees earning more than $15 per hour. Be-
cause all regressors in the model were binary, the mar-
ginal effect of a given covariate on pension coverage
was estimated by taking the difference between the
predicted probability of coverage when the factor
was present and the predicted probability when not

means. For the wealth regressions, marginal effects were
computed as eB - 1, where B is the estimated regres-
sion coefficient.
Decomposition of Gender Differences
We also decomposed gender differences in pen-
sions into the portions that could be explained by ob-
servable characteristics of men and women in order
to assess the impact of different variables on the
gender gap. As Oaxaca (1973) has pointed out, the
difference in some mean outcome, say pension
wealth, for two groups, say men and women, can be
expressed as:
or
(3)
(4)
where X-, is the vector of mean explanatory variables
for gender / (/' = males and females) and (3, is the
vector of regression coefficients for gender /. The first
term in Equations 3 and 4 represents the portion of
the difference in outcomes that can be attributed to
group differences in observed characteristics, which is
often referred to as the explained portion of the dif-
ference. The second term, often referred to as the
unexplained portion of the difference, is the fraction
attributable to the difference in regression coeffi-
cients, or the returns to particular characteristics. Be-
cause the portion of the gender gap that can be ex-
plained by differences in observable characteristics
can vary sharply depending upon whether male coef-
ficients or female coefficients are used as weights and
neither estimate is preferred a priori, we reported re-
sults from both Equations 3 and 4.
Although the approach described above cannot be
applied directly to probit equations, we used a similar
technique, employed by Even and Macpherson (1990,
1994), to decompose the gender gap in pension
coverage. The fraction of the gender difference in
coverage that can be attributable to characteristic j can
be expressed as:
or
(3 X -
(5)
(6)
where x,y is the mean value of characteristic j for gen-
der /, P(
y is the estimated regression coefficient for
characteristic j, and X, and (3, are defined above. As
with the linear decomposition, we estimated the por-
tion of the gender gap attributable to given character-
istics by computing both Equations 5 and 6, because
results can vary depending upon whether male coeffi-
cients or female coefficients are used as weights.
Results
Pension Coverage
Table 2 compares worker characteristics and pen-
sion coverage for men and women. (Percentages were
weighted by the inverse of the sampling probability
to reflect the oversampling of Blacks and Hispanics in
the HRS.) There were strong gender differences in
personal and job characteristics for full-time wage and
salary workers. Chi-square tests indicated that all of
these differences, with the exception of firm size, were
statistically significant at the 5% level. Women in the
sample were slightly more likely than men to have
completed high school (81% vs 78%) but were slightly
less likely to have completed college. Female workers
were substantially more likely than men to belong to
a racial minority; 17% of women, versus only 12% of
men, were not White. Women in the sample were
also much less likely than men to be married and more
likely than men to be widowed, divorced, or sepa-
rated. For example, 10% of the women in the sample
but only 1% of men were widowed.
The job characteristics of full-time workers approach-
ing retirement also differed sharply by gender. Men
had longer job tenure and were substantially more
likely than women to have worked for their current
employer for more than 20 years. Men were more
likely than women to work in the manufacturing in-
dustry, whereas women were clustered in the profes-
sional services industry. In terms of occupation, women
were more likely than men to work in clerical jobs,
whereas construction, precision production, mechanic
and repair services, operators, and agriculture, forestry,
and fishing (which are included in the "other" occu-
pational category in Table 2) were predominantly male
occupations. Men were also more likely than women
to be covered by union contracts. Finally, men earned
substantially higher salaries and wages than women.
For example, 47% of men earned more than $15 per
hour, compared with only 17% of women.
The last two columns of Table 2 report the per-
centage of full-time wage and salary workers with
pension coverage, by gender and worker characteris-
tics. Overall, men were significantly more likely than
women to participate in pension plans on the current
job. Fully 75% of men belonged to a plan, compared
with only 68% of women. The entire gender differ-
ence arose from differences in combination coverage,
defined as having more than one plan from the cur-
rent job (generally a combination of defined benefit
and defined contribution plans). Only 16% of women
had combination coverage on the current job, com-
pared with 24% of men. "*"
For workers with a particular characteristic, cover-
age rates forjnen and women were generally similar,
although some important gender differences were
evident in our sample. Whereas rates of pension cov-
erage were virtually identical for male and female
college graduates, men had significantly higher cover-
age rates than women among workers with only some
high school, among high school graduates, and among
workers with less than four years of college. Pension

coverage rates were also significantly higher for men
than for women among Whites and married individu-
als. Rates of pension coverage were similar for men
and women with limited job tenure, but men had a
substantial advantage among workers with more than
20 years of experience with the current employer.
Men had significantly higher rates of coverage than
women among workers in the manufacturing, trade,
and professional services industries and among work-
ers in the professional, clerical, and services occupa-
tions. Among unionized workers and workers in large
firms, rates of coverage were also higher for men than
women. The only group for which women had sig-
nificantly higher rates of coverage than men was low-
wage workers. Whereas rates of coverage were virtu-
ally identical for workers earning more than $15 per
hour, women enjoyed a clear advantage over men
in terms of pension coverage for workers earning less
than $15 per hour. For example, 63% of women in
the sample earning between $6 and $10 per hour
had pension coverage on the current job, compared
with only 56% of men.
Table 3 reports the marginal effects of worker and
job characteristics on pension coverage, based on probit
equations that were estimated separately for men and
women. Our results were similar for men and women.
Controlling for other observable characteristics, pen-
sion coverage rates were significantly lower among full-
time workers who had only limited education, who
were not White, and who were not covered by union
contracts. Workers who were employed by the cur-
rent firm for fewer than five years were also less likely
to participate in pension plans on the current job than
more senior workers, but additional years of service
beyond five years had only small and generally insig-
nificant effects on pension coverage. Coverage rates
were especially low for workers in small firms. Hold-
ing other observable factors constant, women in firms
with fewer than 100 employees were 33 percentage
points less likely to have pension coverage than women
employed by firms with 500 or more workers. The
wage level also had large effects on pension cover-
age. For women, workers earning less than $6 per
hour were 25 percentage points less likely to partici-
pate in pension plans on the current job than workers
earning more than $15 per hour. The effect of low
wage on coverage was even larger for men. In addi-
tion, we found some significant differences in pension
coverage by industry and occupation, with coverage
rates especially low in the nonprofessional services
industry for both men and women and in the trade
industry and services occupation for women. Marital
status had significant effects on coverage for men but
not for women. Men who were widowed or divorced
were significantly less likely to have pension coverage
on the current job than married men.
The shortfall in pension coverage observed for
women relative to men may arise because women are
less likely than men to possess particular characteris-
tics associated with pension coverage or because par-
ticular characteristics are associated with lower rates
of coverage for women than for men. Table 4 de-
composes the gender gap in pension coverage into

Notes: Table entries indicate the percentage of the gender dif-

is based on Equation 6 in the text. The sample was restricted to

the percentage that can be attributed to gender dif-
ferences in each of the variables in our models. The
decompositions reported in the table were estimated
first using male coefficients as weights (corresponding
to Equation 5) and then using female coefficients as
weights (corresponding to Equation 6). Weighting by
male coefficients, our model predicted that 78% of
the gender gap in pension coverage would be elimi-
nated if men and women had identical characteris-
tics. The wage gap between men and women ac-
counted for most of the gender gap in pension cover-
age. Equalizing job tenure, marital status, and union
membership for men and women would also have
large effects on narrowing the coverage gap. However,
when weighting by female coefficients from the probit
equation, observable differences between men and
women accounted for only 27% of the gender gap in
pension coverage. The decomposition was quite sen-
sitive to the choice of weights because the probability
of pension coverage was found to be substantially less
responsive to job tenure, union membership, marital
status, and wage levels for women than for men. The
actual distribution of industry and occupation favored
pension coverage for women, so that equalizing the
distribution for men and women would increase the
gender gap in coverage, regardless of the choice of
weights.
Pension Wealth
Observed differences in pension wealth between
men and women may arise from both the gender gap
in pension coverage and from the gender gap in
pension wealth conditional on coverage. To explore
differences in wealth conditional on coverage, we ex-
amined data from the pension provider supplement
to the HRS. Table 5 reports worker characteristics and
median pension wealth for the sample of full-time
wage and salary workers for whom information from
pension providers was available and who had pen-
sion coverage on the current job. The data were weighted
to account for the underrepresentation of workers in
small firms and workers in defined contribution plans
in the pension provider sample and to account for
the oversampling of Blacks and Hispanics in the HRS.
As we noted earlier in this article, we believe that
estimates of pension wealth for this sample of work-
ers will be more accurate than estimates based on
self-reports of expected future benefits. Characteris-
tics of the sample of covered workers differed from
the full sample of workers in ways that reflected the
patterns of pension coverage observed in Table 2. For
example, the sample of workers with matched infor-
mation from pension providers was better educated,
earned higher wages, had longer job tenure, was more
likely to belong to unions, and was more likely to be
employed by large firms than the full sample of work-
ers. However, the patterns of gender differences in
personal and job characteristics were quite similar for
the two samples. For example, in the sample of full-
time workers linked to pension provider information,
higher percentages of men than women had long job
tenure, earned high wages, and belonged to FaDor
unions. These same patterns were also observed in
the full sample of workers described in Table 2.
Gender differences in pension wealth on the cur-
rent job among covered full-time workers were much
larger than the observed differences in pension cov-
erage. As reported in columns 3 and 4 of Table 5,
median pension wealth on the current job for cov-
ered men was $120,193, compared to only $68,118
for covered women, representing a 76% advantage
for men. Men had higher pension wealth than women
among virtually all groups within the sample. How-
ever, gender differences were especially large among
workers with defined contribution plans only, who
represented about 30% of the sample. Median pen-
sion wealth was 170% higher for men with defined
contribution plans only than for women. In contrast,
gender differences were fairly modest among workers
with a single defined benefit plan, where men held
only a 30% advantage over women in terms of
median pension wealth. Median pension wealth was
also substantially higher for men than women among
workers in the trade and finance, insurance, and real
estate industries and in sales and clerical occupations.
Somewhat surprisingly, gender differences in pension
wealth were small and statistically insignificant within
wage groups. In fact, among workers with positive pen-
sion wealth earning between $10 and $15 per hour,
median pension wealth was slightly higher for women
than for men. Gender differences were also small and
insignificant among workers in nonprofessional ser-
vices industries, non-White workers, unmarried work-
ers, and workers with tenure between 10 and 15 years
or one year or less with the current employer.
Table 6 reports the results of linear regressions of
the natural log of pension wealth on worker and job
characteristics. Columns 1 and 2 present marginal ef-
fects for men and women when the models were
estimated using ordinary least squares, and columns 3
and 4 present marginal effects for models that were
corrected for the nonrandomness of the provider

Notes: The marginal effects are estimated from linear regressions of the natural log of pension wealth. The regressions in columns 3
and 4 include a selection correction term derived from a probit model of the probability of being linked to provider data. All regressions
also include an intercept term. Asterisks and daggers indicate the statistical significance of estimated effects, relative to the omitted
reference category (** = p < .01; * = .01 < p < .05; + = .05 < p < .10; * = .10 < p < .15). The sample was restricted to current full-
time wage and salary workers who were age-eligible respondents (aged 51-61) and self-report pension coverage on the current job.

matches, as described earlier. Both sets of models in-
dicated that wage level and job tenure have large
effects on pension wealth for both men and women,
conditional on having pension coverage. In the un-
adjusted model, pension wealth was 92% lower for
covered men earning $6 per hour or less than for
covered men earning more than $15 per hour, hold-
ing other factors constant. The wage effects were
smaller but still substantial for women. Pension wealth
for both men and women also steadily increased with
job tenure. For example, in the unadjusted model,
covered women with only 5 to 10 years of experi-
ence on the job had accumulated only 64% as much
pension wealth as women who had spent more than
20 years with the employer, all else equal. Demo-
graphic variables did not generally have significant ef-
fects in the unadjusted models.
Attempts to correct for the nonrandomness of the
provider matches had some substantial effects on the
pension wealth models. However, because the selec-
tion corrections were not very stable and were quite
sensitive to the way in which the selection model was
specified, the corrected estimates may not be supe-
rior to the unadjusted estimates. The unadjusted
model predicted tnat women in public administration
and in finance, insurance, and real estate industries
had more than twice as much pension wealth as
women working in manufacturing, all else equal. How-
ever, after correcting for selection, the models revealed
no significant differences by industry for women. The
adjusted model indicated that men in professional ser-
vices industries and in public administration had sig-
nificantly less pension wealth than men in manufac-
turing, whereas there were no significant differences
by industry in the unadjusted models for covered male
workers. The estimated effects of firm size on pension
wealth changed sign after correcting for selection. In
the unadjusted model, men and women with pen-
sions in small firms had significantly less pension wealth
on the current job than workers in large firms. The
corrected model, however, indicated that covered workers
in small firms had significantly more pension wealth
than workers in large firms. These differences notwith-
standing, the adjusted and unadjusted models were
consistent in revealing large, significant effects of wages
and job tenure on pension wealth.
To understand better how different personal and
job characteristics contributed to the observed differ-
ences in pension wealth between men and women,
Table 7 decomposes the gender gap in pension wealth
into the percentages that could oe attributed to gen-
der differences in each of the variables in our mod-
els. The decompositions reported in Table 7 were es-
timated first using male coefficients as weights and then
using female coefficients as weights and were based
on linear regression models with and without the se-
lection correction. Differences in observable charac-
teristics--particularly those related to the current job--
between men and women accounted for almost the
entire gender gap in pension wealth. When weighting
by male coefficients, differences in observable char-
acteristics explained 111% of the total gender gap be-
fore correcting for selection, and 138% of the gap

Notes: Table entries indicate the percentage of the gender dif-
ference in pension wealth that can be explained by each factor.
Columns 1 and 3 are based on Equation 3 in the text, and col-
umns 2 and 4 are based on Equation 4 in the text. The sample
was restricted to current full-time wage and salary workers who
were age-eligible respondents (aged 51-61) and were covered by
a pension on the current job. Members of the Armed Forces were

after correcting for selection. In other words, when
weighting by the male coefficients, the model pre-
dicted that gender differences in the returns to per-
sonal and job characteristics in terms of pension wealth
actually favored women over men among full-time
covered workers at midlife. Differences in wages had
the largest effect on the gap in pension wealth, ac-
counting for between 64% and 70% of the pension
wealth gap. Differences in job tenure were also very
important, accounting for between 22% and 36% of
the gap in pension wealth. Correcting for nonrandom-
ness of the provider matches substantially increased
the portion of the gap in pension wealth attributable
to gender differences in industry, because match rates
varied significantly by industry. When weighting by male
coefficients, adjusting for selection increased the pro-
portion of the gap that could be explained by gender
differences in industry from 17% to 44%. Other per-
sonal and job characteristics accounted for only small
portions of the gender gap in pension wealth.
Decompositions weighted by coefficients from the
female pension wealth equations indicate that differ-
ences in observable characteristics between men and
women accounted for most, but not all, of the gender
gap in pension wealth. When weighting by female co-
efficients, the explained portion of the total gender
gap in pension wealth ranged from 70% to 96%. Most
of the discrepancy between the decompositions based
on male coefficients and female coefficients arose from
the smaller portion of the gender gap that could be
explained by wage differences when using the female
rather than male coefficients. The wage gap explained
only 20%-35% of the pension wealth gap with female

coefficients because the wage level was found to have
weaker effects on pension wealth for women than for
men, as reported in Table 6. Despite discrepancies in
the precise magnitude of the estimated effects, how-
ever, each of the decompositions predicted that al-
most all of the gender gap in pension wealth could
be explained by differences in observable characteris-
tics between men and women, and that eliminating
gender differences in wages and job tenure would
dramatically reduce the gap in pension wealth.
Discussion
Evidence from pension provider data in the HRS
indicated that the gender gap in pension wealth on
the current job was substantial among full-time wage
and salary workers. For full-time workers with pen-
sion coverage, median pension wealth on the current
job was 76% greater for men than women, and the
gender gap was even larger among workers who had
only defined contribution plans on the current job.
The gender differential in pension coverage was much
smaller than the differential in wealth, however. Cov-
erage rates were high for both male and female full-
time workers approaching retirement. Fully 75% of men
and 68% of women had some type of pension cover-
age on the current job, although men were substan-
tially more likely than women to participate in more
than one plan on the current job.
Differences in wages and years of job tenure be-
tween men and women accounted for most of the
gender gap in pension wealth on the current job. We
Found that equalizing the number of years of job ten-
ure for men and women could eliminate up to 39%
of the gender gap in pension wealth. Eliminating gen-
der differences in the wage earned on the current job
could eliminate between 20% and 70% of the wealth
gap. We also found that, at most, one third of the
gender gap in pension wealth could not be explained
by gender differences in education, demographics, or
job characteristics. Thus, labor market discrimination
against women, differences in tastes for pension in-
come between men and women, and other unob-
servable factors affecting pension income appeared to
account for only a small part of the gender difference
in pension wealth. Our findings differed from the re-
sults of Even and Macpherson (1994), who concluded
that except for income earned on the longest job, per-
sonal and job characteristics could not explain much
of the gender gap in pension benefits. However, Even
and Macpherson (1994) examined gender differences
in pension income received by recently retired per-
sons with some past work experience, whereas we
examined differences in pension wealth on the cur-
rent job for a sample of full-time workers. Observed
patterns in pensions based upon benefits received
from all past jobs may not be comparable to patterns
based on pension wealth earned on the current job.
Restricting our sample to full-time workers also led us
to estimate smaller gender differences in pensions
than Even and Macpherson (1994), because part-time
workers have much lower pension benefits on the cur-
rent job than full-time workers, and women are more
likely than men to work part time. In addition, mem-
bers of our sample were born about 15 years later
than the members of the sample examined by Even
and Macpherson (1994), and pension benefits may
have changed substantially during that period.
For a number of different reasons, the results de-
scribed here may present an overly optimistic picture
of women's experiences in the labor market and un-
derstate the gender differences in pension benefits.
First, we have compared pension wealth for men and
women only on the current job, but retirement in-
come includes pension benefits from all past jobs. A
recent study found that a large portion of the pen-
sion wealth held by workers approaching retirement
was earned on past jobs, not the current job (McCarry
& Davenport, 1998). Gender differences in total pen-
sion wealth may be more pronounced than differences
observed only on the current job. Second, by focus-
ing only on full-time workers we did not consider part-
time workers and persons not in the labor force, who
are likely to have low pension wealth and are pre-
dominantly female (see Appendix, Note 5). Third, part
of the gender difference in future annual pension
benefits among current workers is masked by gender
differences in life expectancy, which favor women. Be-
cause women live longer than men on average, gen-
der differences in annual pension benefits received
during retirement from defined benefit plans will be
larger than the estimated gap in wealth. Fourth, evi-
dence that women invest more conservatively than men
and earn lower returns than men do may lead to larger
gender differences in pension wealth than we have
estimated, because we assumed that men and women
earned equal returns on their defined contribution plan
accounts. Differences in investment behavior may have
larger effects on the gender gap in pension wealth for
future cohorts, who will hold much of their pension
wealth in defined contribution plans. Finally, although
our results indicate that most of the gender gap in
pension wealth can be explained by differences in ob-
servable job characteristics between men and women,
and in particular by gender differences in wages, they
do not explain why women earn less than men in the
first place. Recent research indicates that about 10%
of the gender gap in wages remains unexplained after
controlling for differences in observable characteristics
between men and women and may result from dis-
crimination against women in the labor market (Blau
& Kahn, 1997). Although discriminatory behavior may
not directly affect women's pension wealth in a sub-
stantial way, it may play an important indirect role by
reducing the wages earned by women.
Despite these caveats, our results are reason for op-
timism about the economic security of future cohorts
of retiring women. The dramatic reduction over the
past 30 years in gender differences in employment
characteristics, which account for most of the pension
gender gap among workers currently approaching
retirement, suggests that the gap in pension wealth
between men and women will narrow over the
coming decades. Women's labor force participation,
years of work experience, and earnings have all been
increasing, both in absolute terms and relative to men,
332 The Gerontologist
since members of the baby boom cohort began reaching
adulthood in 1970. From 1970 to 1995, labor force
participation rates increased 26% for women aged 35-
44 while declining 6% for men at the same ages. Dur-
ing the same period, real weekly wages among full-
time workers aged 35-44 increased 20% for women
and fell 13% for men (Blau, 1998). Although young
women are still less likely to work than men and con-
tinue to earn less than men when they do work, the
likely result of these trends will be greater pension
wealth for women, leading to more equitable labor
outcomes for working women and improved economic
security for elderly women in the next century.

Notes
1. Gustman and Steinmeier (1993) found that the
workers in defined contribution plans were no more
likely to quit their jobs than workers in defined ben-
efits plans. Because defined contribution plans do not
generally backload compensation, their finding sug-
gests that the low turnover rates exhibited by workers
with pensions are driven not by potential capital losses
but by the compensation premia earned by covered
workers.
2. An important advantage of pensions for most
workers is that they offer tax-advantaged opportuni-
ties to save for retirement, because contributions to
the plan and interest they earn are not taxed until
pension benefits are received. Even and Macpherson
(1994) argue that women will benefit less from the
tax advantages of pensions because they earn less than
men, and thus will be less likely to choose jobs that
offer generous pensions. However, most married couples
file joint tax returns, so the tax savings offered by
pension plans should be equally advantageous to most
married men and married women.
3. Self-reported HRS data have been used by other
researchers to estimate pension wealth; see, for ex-
ample, Smith (1995) and McGarry-and Davenport
(1998).
4. The ISR software for estimating pension wealth
was written by Richard Curtin and updated by Robert
Peticolas and Jody Lamkin.
5. In the HRS, 47% of the women ages 51-61 were
not working at wave 1 and 13% were working part
time, compared to 39% of men who were not work-
ing and 4% of men who were working part time.
