Volunteering and Mortality Among Older Adults:
Findings From a National Sample

Objectives. Although a number of authors have proposed that older volunteers should benefit in terms of better health and
well-being, few researchers have examined the issue empirically to see whether this is true. The purpose of this article is to
build on this literature by empirically examining the association between volunteering and mortality among older adults.
Methods. Using data from a nationally representative sample, we use Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the
effects of volunteering on the rate of mortality among persons aged 65 and older.
Results. We find that volunteering has a protective effect on mortality among those who volunteered for one organization or
for forty hours or less over the past year. We further find that the protective effects of volunteering are strongest for respondents
who report low levels of informal social interaction and who do not live alone.
Discussion. We discuss the possibility that the curvilinear relationship we observe between volunteering and mortality is
due to a combination of factors, including self-identity, role strain, and meaningfulness. Other research using more precise data
is needed to determine whether these ideas are supportable.
A DVANCES over the past century in health and longevity have
A \ left many older adults with a number of years of life follow-
ing retirement Although there is a great deal of heterogeneity in
how older adults spend their post-retirement years, several authors
(e.g., Chambre, 1993; Herzog, Kahn, Morgan, Jackson, &
Antonucci, 1989; Herzog & Morgan, 1993; Hodgkinson &
Weitzman, 1988) have noted that many engage in volunteering or
work for voluntary organizations. If it is true that many older
adults spend some of their time volunteering, then it may be the
case that the upcoming surge in the elderly population due to the
baby boomers hitting retirement age will yield a vast new crop of
volunteers. If federal and state governments continue to cut back
on spending for social welfare programs, this pool of volunteers
may become increasingly important to the overall maintenance of
our society.
In addition to the societal benefits that accrue through volun-
teering, such behavior might also have positive health effects
for volunteers. For instance, it has been suggested that elderly
volunteers should benefit from volunteering through increased
levels of life satisfaction and self-esteem, feelings of usefulness,
and through the betterment of health (Hunter & Linn, 1980-81).
Moreover, given that many older adults have exited the work
role through retirement, volunteering and other helping behav-
iors may act as a way to fill in for lost roles (Chambre, 1987;
Hunter & Linn, 1980-81; Ward, 1979). Fischer and Schaffer
(1993) have termed this overall perspective "inoculation." In
explaining the perspective, they state, "volunteer work can in-
oculate, or protect, the older person from the hazards of retire-
ment, physical decline and inactivity" (pp. 9-10).
However, little research has examined whether voluntary ac-
tivity actually promotes better health and well-being (Fischer &
Schaffer, 1993; Monk, 1995). The few studies done have largely
supported the notion that volunteering is beneficial (e.g., Krause,
Herzog, & Baker, 1992; Luks & Payne, 1992; Mclntosh &
Danigelis, 1995; Sabin, 1993; Ward, 1979; Young & Glasgow,
1998), but data and analytical limitations of these studies have
compromised their ability to make statements about the relation-
ship between volunteering and well-being. One common prob-
lem cited by multiple scholars (e.g., Chambre, 1987; Fischer &
Schaffer, 1993; Okun, Stock, Haring, & Witter, 1984) is disen-
tangling causality. That is, because good health and availability
of social resources lead to volunteering, it is difficult to deter-
mine the causal ordering between well-being and that activity.
Thus, more research is needed to determine whether volunteer-
ing does indeed affect the lives of elderly adults in beneficial
ways (Herzog & House, 1991; Monk, 1995).
The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship be-
tween volunteering and mortality using data from a prospective,
nationally representative data set. Our research expands upon ex-
tant research that has linked various forms of social participation
and integration to mortality (e.g., Berkman & Syme, 1979; Bryant
& Rakowski, 1992; House, Robbins, & Metzner, 1982; Rushing,
Ritter, & Burton, 1992; Strawbridge, Cohen, Shema, & Kaplan,
1997). By adjusting for several possible confounding factors, such
a prospective analysis of mortality overcomes the problems of po-
tential reverse or reciprocal causation encountered in earlier stud-
ies of volunteering and well-being. Finally, based on the role con-
text perspective, we test hypotheses that the relationship between
volunteering and mortality is moderated by other measures of so-
cial integration.
Theoretical Overview
Why might volunteering affect the mortality rates of older
adults? The most plausible explanation involves the utility of
roles. It has been suggested that for older adults who have mostly
or fully disengaged from the formal work sphere, volunteering
can become an important social role (Chambre, 1987). Evidence
not directly related to volunteering has indicated that engaging in
S173
S174 MUSICKETAL
multiple roles can reduce the risk of mortality. In their study of
roles and longevity among women, Moen, Dempster-McClain,
and Williams (1992) used 30-year mortality follow-up data to
show that the number of roles engaged in byrespondentswas in-
verselyrelatedto risk of mortality. Moreover, they found that the
role that had the strongest protective effect on mortality was that
of being a member of a club or organization; consequently, they
argued that "while roles generally may contribute both stress and
support to women's lives, participation in voluntary associations
may produce more benefits than costs" (p. 642).
Moen and colleagues (1992) delineate three commonly held
perspectives on the nature of roles. Role enhancement argues that
accumulated roles serve to enhance or increase power and status,
which in turn translates into better health. Role strain claims that
too many roles can place a burden on the individual, which in turn
results in worse health outcomes (see also Pearlin, 1983). Finally,
they cite the role context viewpoint, which takes into account the
number ofroles as well as the setting and content of those roles.
These three perspectives can be applied profitably to the study
of volunteering and well-being. It is generally believed that volun-
teering provides role enhancement. That is, the additional volun-
teer role should serve to increase feelings of power and status, and
of meaning to oneself and to others. It might also be the case,
however, that for older adults who suffer declines in function and
ability, the additional volunteer role could become a burden.
Indeed, one might expect that those who volunteer in great
amounts or for numerous groups will not receive the potential
health benefits of volunteering. In short, it is volunteering in mod-
eration that should be valuable for health and mortality outcomes.
The third role perspective discussed by Moen and colleagues
(1992), role context, suggests that the effects of volunteering
may not be equally evident for all older adults. Given the impor-
tance of social integration for mortality as described in previous
studies (e.g., Berkman & Syme, 1979; House et al., 1982), indi-
viduals who are less well integrated into society (e.g., via mar-
riage or contact with friends and family) might benefit most
from volunteering. Likewise, persons who otherwise enjoy high
amounts of social integration may not receive many benefits
frdm volunteering in that they already receive through other
means any benefits that may come from volunteering.
Hypotheses andModel Specification
Given the theoretical issues outlined above, we offer the fol-
lowing hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1 Volunteering in modest amounts is associ-
ated with lower risk of mortality.
Hypothesis 2 Volunteering in large amounts is associated
with no differential risk or higher risk of
mortality.
Hypothesis 3 The effect of volunteering on the risk of
mortality is strongest among those who dis-
play low levels of social integration.
The central part of these hypotheses is tested by regressing
mortality on volunteering and other control variables. We use
two measures of the volunteering: range and amount. The other
control variables consist of a number of variables related to
mortality and volunteering, including measures of physical ac-
tivity, physical health, socioeconomic status, social integration,
and demographic characteristics.
METHODS
Data
Data for this study come from the American's Changing
Lives (ACL; House, 1995) data set. The data are a multistage
stratified area sample representative of the noninstitutionalized
U.S. population aged 25 and older with aresponserate of 67%
of sampled individuals and 68% for sampled households. The
data were collected over three waves in 1986 (N = 3,617), 1989
(N = 2,867), and 1994 (N = 2,348) through face-to-face inter-
views conducted in the respondents' homes. In order to facilitate
subgroup analyses by age and race, the data set contains an
oversample of Blacks and adults aged 60 and older. All the anal-
yses reported here use weighted data in order to adjust for the
oversamples and biases due to nonresponse. The present analy-
ses focus on respondents aged 65 and older and use data col-
lected in thefirstwave and the follow-up mortality data, yielding
a total unweighted sample size of 1,211. Because the ACL data
were collected using a complex sampling design, the variances
of the estimates in theregressionmodels may be understated if
one assumes a simple random sample, as is done in most tests of
statistical significance. As such, we adjust for the sampling de-
sign effects using SUDAAN (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1997),
which makes the necessary adjustments to the variances using
Taylor series linearization procedures. There are very few cases
with missing data on the variables; for those with missing data,
values were imputed based on other available information in the
data, or via substituting a modal, mean, or median value if such
relevant information was not available.
Measures
Mortality.--Deaths were ascertained through tracking and
interviewing processes and via the National Death Index from
mid-1986 through March 1994, yielding an average follow-up
of 7.5 years. To date, the vast majority of the 403 deaths
(90.3%) have also been confirmed through death certificates.
Reviews of reported deaths not yet confirmed by death certifi-
cates suggest that all of these are almost certainly dead.
Volunteering.--Respondents were asked whether they had
volunteered in the past year for any of the following groups: (a)
church, synagogue or otherreligiousorganization; (b) school or
educational organization; (c) political group or labor union; (d)
senior citizen group or related organization; and (e) other organi-
zations. Respondents could have acknowledged volunteering for
more than one of these groups. We calculated the volunteering
range measure by summing the number of groups mentioned.
Because we are interested in how much volunteering respon-
dents did rather than what type they did, we did not include in-
formation about the type of groups for which people volun-
teered. Respondents who said they had volunteered were also
asked about how much time they had spent volunteering across
all groups during the past year. Response categories for this
question included less than 20 hours, 20-39 hours, 40-79 hours,
80-159 hours, and 160 hours or more. Midpoint values are as-
signed to represent each category in the volunteering range mea-
sure. For the top category, a value of 200 was assigned.
From our hypotheses we expect the greatest benefits of vol-
unteering to come from modest amounts of that activity. Hence,
VOLUNTEERINGAND MORTALITY S175
we coded the volunteering variables as dichotomous dummy
variable classifications. For range, the variables indicate volun-
teering for (1) one group and (2) two or more groups. For
amount, the variables indicate volunteering (1) less man 40
hours and (2) 40 or more hours. The reference category for
both sets of variables is no volunteering. It is important to note
that volunteering amount and range are highly correlated (r =
.66) and, for that reason, are subject to multicollinearity prob-
lems when assessing their effects in a multiple regression
framework. To overcome this problem, we estimated the effects
of each set of dummy variables in its own series of models.
Social integration.--Our first measure of integration, informal
social interaction, is an index constructed by taking the standard-
ized mean of two items: (a) how often respondents talk on the
phone with friends, neighbors, or relatives in the typical week; and
(b) how often they get together with friends or relatives. The re-
sponse categories for the first item range from (1) never to (6)
more than once a day, and for the second item they range from (1)
never to (6) more than once a week. Our second measure of social
integration indicates whether respondents lived alone. Such a
measure is a better indicator of integration than marital status in
that it reflects the possibility that an older adult is married but that
the spouse lives in another setting and also the residential social
integration of unmarried persons. Respondents were coded one on
this variable if they reported living alone and zero otherwise.
Physical activity.--Our measure of physical activity is derived
from three variables that measure how often (from [1] never to
[4] often) respondents engage in (a) active sports or exercise, (b)
gardening or yard work, and (c) taking walks. The index was cre-
ated by taking the standardized mean of the three items. For these
analyses, we have split the index into quintiles of roughly equal
size to accommodate the possibility of a nonlinear relationship.
Health.--Physical health status was measured using two vari-
ables. The first {functional impairment) is a functional health
index with a four-level Gutman-type scale that reflects the severity
of physical impairment. Categories include (1) no limitation; (2)
difficulty walking a few blocks or climbing a fewflightsof stairs;
(3) difficulty doing heavy work around the house (such as shovel-
ing snow or washing walls); and (4) being confined to a bed or
chair. We dichotomized the scale such that respondents who re-
port any impairment are coded one whereas those with no impair-
ment are coded zero. The second measure {potentiallyfatal condi-
tions) is a tally of the number of possibly fatal health problems
experienced by respondents over the past year. Conditions include
lung disease, heart attack, diabetes, cancer, and stroke.
Controls.--Other control variables include sex (female: 0 =
male, 1 = female), race (Black: 0 = non-Black [95.1% of whom
are White], 1 = Black), age (age: in years, range 65-96), educa-
tion (education: in years, range 0-17), and household income
(income: coded as midpoints, 10 categories ranging from less
than $5,000 to $80,000 or more, with a Pareto estimate for the
highest category). In earlier forms of the analyses we included
controls for employment, formal social interaction, and self-
rated heath. To simplify the models, we did not include them in
thefinalanalyses. Doing so had no effect on the association be-
tween volunteering and mortality.
Analyses
To assess the effects of volunteering and the other factors on
mortality, we use hierarchical Cox proportional hazards models
(Allison, 1995). First, we entered only the volunteering vari-
ables. Next, we controlled for demographic characteristics and
then for socioeconomic status. In the fourth model, we included
measures of health and physical activity. In the final model we
added indicators of social integration. By regressing mortality
on the variables in this fashion, we can determine what factors,
if any, tended to erode an otherwise significant zero-order rela-
tionship between volunteering and mortality.
To test the interaction effects, we created cross-product terms
between the volunteering variables and each of the social inte-
gration measures, rendering two sets of two cross-product
terms for each volunteering measure (i.e., range or amount).
Each set of terms is entered into the full main effects model to
test the moderating effects in question. Following those tests,
we divide the sample by levels of social integration then regress
mortality on volunteering and the other covariates. Such a strat-
egy allows us to determine the effects of volunteering at spe-
cific levels of integration.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the independent
variables and zero-order correlations between those variables,
volunteering, and mortality. In the first two columns of the
table, we display the range and mean for each of the variables.
Note that for the dichotomous variables, the mean indicates the
proportion of people in the category coded one. For example,
18% of the sample volunteered for one organization. Adding
the totals for the volunteering dummies, we see that about 35%
of the total sample volunteered in the past year. This level of
volunteering among older adults is similar to that found by
Hodgkinson and Weitzman (1988). The mean number of hours
volunteered in the past year is somewhat low (27.7 hours) but
reflects the high number of people who did not volunteer. In
terms of the demographic and socioeconomic variables, a ma-
jority of the sample was female (60%) and non-Black (91%),
the mean age of the sample was about 73, the mean level of ed-
ucation was less than high school, and the mean income was
about $18,000. In terms of health, the mean number of fatal
conditions was less than one, and a minority of respondents
(40%) reported some functional impairment. Finally, a minority
of the sample (29%) reported living alone.
The latter three columns of the table report the zero-order
correlations between the independent variables and mortality
and volunteering. In terms of volunteering, being Black and
older were associated with less volunteering. Consistent with
other studies of volunteering (e.g., Wilson & Musick, 1997),
education and income were positively related to both volunteer-
ing range and amount. Respondents who reported better health
and more physical activity also volunteered more. Similarly,
people who were more socially integrated volunteered more
than those who were not.
Looking at the correlations with mortality, respondents who
volunteered over the past year were less likely to die over the
follow-up period; however, the pattern is curvilinear. That is,
the protective effects of volunteering were strongest among
those volunteering for one organization or for less than forty
hours. The other associations with mortality in this table are not

surprising: being female, younger, of higher socioeconomic sta-
tus, more integrated, more active, and more healthy were asso-
ciated with survival over the follow-up period.
Table 2 presents the models in which mortality was regressed
on the volunteering range dummy variables and controls. It is im-
portant to note that the figures shown in this table are hazard rate
ratios; as such, coefficients greater than one indicate a greater haz-
ard rate for death whereas those less than one indicate a smaller
hazard rate. Model 1 includes only the volunteering range vari-
ables. It shows that respondents who volunteered were at a re-
duced risk for mortality. The strongest effect (i.e., the lowest haz-
ard rate ratio for mortality) occurred for those volunteering for
only one organization, again reflecting a curvilinear pattern.
In Model 2 we adjusted for the demographic factors. It is
readily apparent that the beneficial effects of volunteering de-
creased (i.e., hazard rate ratios became closer to 1.0) upon in-
clusion of these variables, but the curvilinearity of the effect be-
came more clear: though the effect of volunteering for one
group was still significant, the effect of volunteering for two or
more groups became insignificant. Age and sex both had strong
effects in the usual directions. Separate analyses (not shown
here) indicated that although both age and gender decreased the
effect of volunteering, the inclusion of age resulted in the
largest decrease.
In the third model, we included the socioeconomic variables.
Recall from Table 1 that levels of volunteering activity were
sharply graded by socioeconomic status. Consequently, we
would expect that the inclusion of these variables would also
curtail the volunteering effects. It was the case that the effect of
volunteering for one organization decreased, but this reduction
was small, with the effects of the other volunteering variable de-
creasing more. After incorporating measures of health and phys-
ical activity in Model 4, the effect of volunteering for one orga-
nization decreased a small amount but still remained significant
whereas higher levels of volunteering produced a higher (i.e.,
>1.0) hazard rate ratio for mortality. In terms of the other vari-
ables, higher levels of physical activity were associated with a
lower mortality rate, and reporting more fatal conditions or
some functional impairment was associated with a higher rate.
In the final model, we included two measures of social inte-
gration; the inclusion of these variables did little to affect the
association between volunteering and mortality. It is surprising
that we found no significant effect for social integration given
mortality studies done by other researchers that showed such an
effect (e.g., Berkman & Syme, 1979; Blazer, 1982; House et
al., 1982). Note, however, that these studies were generally ge-
ographically limited, dealt mostly with younger populations,
and did not include a measure of volunteering.
Table 3 shows the mortality hazard rate ratios for volunteering
amount and the other control variables. The effects for volunteer-
ing amount were very similar to those for volunteering range:
volunteering in modest amounts (less than forty hours) had a pro-
tective effect on mortality whereas volunteering for forty or more
hours had no effect. However, the effect of volunteering for a
modest number of hours was not as strong as the effect of volun-
teering for one organization. Indeed, although the effect of volun-
teering less than forty hours remained significant throughout the
models, it only remained marginally so in the last model.
The final part of our analyses tested our third hypothesis.
Basically stated, we expected that the effect of volunteering on

mortality would be strongest among older adults who reported
lower levels of social integration, measured either by living ar-
rangements or by informal social interaction. To test this hypoth-
esis, we entered all of the variables in the full main effects mod-
els and then included cross-product terms between the
volunteering variables and one of the social integration vari-
ables. Consequently, each of four models contained one set of
volunteering variables, control variables, and cross-product
terms between volunteering and one social integration variable.
In order to save space, we do not report these results in tabular
form in this article; they are, however, available from the authors
upon request.
For informal social interaction, we found a significant mod-
erating effect for volunteering for one organization. In line with
our expectations, the coefficient revealed that the protective ef-
fect of volunteering for one organization was strongest among
individuals who engaged in little informal social interaction (b
= .63, p < .05). We further found that living alone had slight
moderating effects for volunteering for one organization (b =
.67, p < .10) and volunteering for less than forty hours (b = .59,
p < 10). However, the direction of the effect was not expected:
the signs of the coefficients indicated that the effects of volun-
teering were strongest among people who did not live alone.
Finally, to determine whether the addition of the cross-product
terms added to the overall fit of the models, we computed chi-
square difference tests between the final additive effects models
shown in Tables 2 and 3 and the models with the cross-product
terms. Only the chi-square difference for the model for infor-
mal social interaction and volunteering range cross-product
terms was significant (x2, df = 9.43, 2; p < .05). As such, this is
the only effect we will discuss further.
Because cross-product terms can often be difficult to inter-
pret, we divided the sample at the mean level of informal social
interaction and computed the effects of volunteering within
each of those subgroups, adjusted for all of the control vari-
ables. Table 4 displays the results of these analyses. According
to the hazard rate ratios shown in the table, the effects of volun-
teering for one organization are strongest among respondents
who engage in low levels of informal social interaction. This re-
sult is consistent with thefindingsfor the cross-product terms.

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is
evidence to support the notion that volunteering has protective
mortality effects for older adults. Our results lend support to
this idea in that volunteers had a lower adjusted mortality haz-
ard than nonvolunteers. However, such a statement must be
qualified in several ways.
Not all volunteers were protected by that activity. Rather, vol-
unteering only in moderate amounts produced a lower risk of
mortality. These effects were strong in bivariate analyses but were
attenuated upon the inclusion of demographic characteristics,
such as age and gender. This curvilinear effect for volunteering
supports both the role enhancement and role strain perspectives.
In terms of the former, the findings indicated that simply adding
the volunteering role was protective of mortality. To gain the pro-
tective effect, one did not have to volunteer to a great extent.
Indeed, volunteering at higher levels provided no protective effect
This finding is consonant with the role strain hypothesis, which
would argue that for older adults, taking on too much volunteering
activity incurs just enough detriments to offset the potential bene-
ficial effects of the activity. We cannot, however, directly test with
VOLUNTEERING AND MORTALITY S179
our data the major assumption of the role strain hypothesis: volun-
teering for more than one group or for more than 40 hours during
the past year--which in most cases is between 40 and 80 hours--
actually results in increased role conflict or additional work that
constitutes a burden. Future analyses should attempt to resolve
this issue with more specific data on the nature and experience of
volunteer work and other forms of productive activity.
The role context perspective also receives some support. That
is, we found that the effect of volunteering on mortality differed
depending on the level of social integration of the respondent. We
expected that the protective effect of volunteering would be
strongest among those with lower levels of social integration.
That expectation was met for informal social interaction but not
for living arrangements. In the latter case, the protective effects of
volunteering were marginally strongest among respondents who
were living with others. In an effort to resolve this counterintu-
itive finding, we computed several sets of analyses using alterna-
tive interaction effects (e.g., with gender) to determine whether
some other factor was driving this pattern. We found no evidence
that other factors were responsible for the effect. Pending addi-
tional and stronger replication of the result, we do not believe it
should be interpreted further.
Given that the effects of volunteering for one group were some-
what stronger than those for volunteering for a few hours, we are
led to ask several questions. First, are respondents who volun-
teered for one organization different in some way than respon-
dents who volunteered for more than one organization? To answer
this question, we computed mean levels of the other variables (i.e.,
demographics, socioeconomic status, health, social interaction) by
the number of organizations volunteered for. In these analyses
(not shown here), we did not uncover any clear pattern of differ-
ences between respondents who volunteered for one organization
and those who voluteered for more groups. It could be the case
that respondents who only volunteered for a single organization
were different from others in some way, but we are unable to tap
those differences here. It may also be the case that respondents
who volunteered for one organization had a stronger intrinsic in-
terest in that organization than did respondents who volunteered
for multiple organizations. Given that we have partly rested our
belief that volunteering will be protective on Chambre's (1987)
notion that volunteering can provide meaningful social roles for
older adults, it may be the case that older adults who volunteered
for one group derived a more meaningful experience from that ac-
tivity than multiple-group volunteers. Further, it might be the case
that simply being able to take on the identity of a volunteer is ben-
eficial for survival. If having the volunteer identity itself is impor-
tant, but actually doing volunteer work is not as important, then
we would expect that the strongest effects of volunteering would
be in the lowest volunteering category. We cannot directly test the
validity of these claims using the data available to us. Future re-
search, however, should consider these possibilities.
The second question we must ask is whether respondents
who volunteered for one group actually performed different
types of activity than did respondents who volunteered for mul-
tiple groups. For example, it may be the case that single-group
volunteers were more likely to volunteer in ways that bring
higher prestige than were volunteers who worked for multiple
organizations. The data available in the ACL provide measures
of the types of organizations for which respondents could volun-
teer; however, the data do not contain information on the types
of work that were actually performed. Future research should
take the type of work into consideration when examining the ef-
fects of volunteering on health. We did test whether the type of
organization volunteered for had an effect on mortality, but we
found no evidence to support this idea.
It should be noted that many individuals in our sample who re-
ported volunteering did so for a religious organization (about
69%). This distribution of volunteers raises the possibility that
what may actually be responsible for the effects of volunteering
on mortality is association with a religious group. There is evi-
dence that attending religious services is associated with mortal-
ity such that persons who attend more frequently derive protec-
tive benefits from that activity (e.g., Hummer, Rogers, Nam, &
Ellison, in press; Strawbridge et al., 1997). In analyses not shown
here, we tested the possibility that the volunteering-mortality re-
lationship was due to religion by recomputing the final main ef-
fects model with a measure of religious service attendance. The
effect of volunteering in this model was unchanged, indicating
that religious activity was not responsible for the effect
hi sum, we found support for the idea that volunteering is
beneficial for older adults in terms of mortality. By using na-
tionally representative data that contain measures of both vol-
unteering and other important constructs, we were able to over-
come many of the limitations that hindered previous research.
Moreover, because we focused prospectively on mortality as
our outcome of interest, we avoided the problem of causal or-
dering that has plagued many of the previous cross-sectional
studies in this area. Although our work is certainly not defini-
tive, due in part to several of the limitations listed above, it does
provide more evidence that social participation in later life may
contribute to successful aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1998).
