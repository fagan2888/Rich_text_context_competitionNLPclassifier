ABSTRACT
This study investigates the role of glycogenolysis in stimu-
lated release of ATP as a transmitter from astrocytes. Within
the last 20 years our understanding of brain glycogenolysis
has changed from it being a relatively uninteresting pro-
cess to being a driving force for essential brain functions
like production of transmitter glutamate and homoeosta-
sis of potassium ions (K+ ) after their release from excited
neurons. Simultaneously, the importance of astrocytic han-
dling of adenosine, its phosphorylation to ATP and release
of some astrocytic ATP, located in vesicles, as an important
transmitter has also become to be realized. Among the proce-
dures stimulating Ca2 + -dependent release of vesicular ATP
are exposure to such transmitters as glutamate and adeno-
sine, which raise intra-astrocytic Ca2 + concentration, or in-
crease of extracellular K+ to a depolarizing level that opens
astrocytic L-channels for Ca2 + and thereby also increase
intra-astrocytic Ca2 + concentration, a prerequisite for
glycogenolysis. The present study has confirmed and quan-
titated stimulated ATP release from well differentiated
astrocyte cultures by glutamate, adenosine or elevated ex-
tracellular K+ concentrations, measured by a luciferin/
luciferase reaction. It has also shown that this release is
virtually abolished by an inhibitor of glycogenolysis as well
as by inhibitors of transmitter-mediated signaling or of
L-channel opening by elevated K+ concentrations.

INTRODUCTION
Stimulated release of ATP from astrocytes has repeatedly
been shown. (i) Caciagli et al. (1988) found that elec-
trical stimulation of cultured astrocytes pre-loaded with
[3H]adenosine released approximately equal amounts of nu-
cleosides and nucleotides to the medium in a Ca2 + - and
K+ -dependent manner. (ii) Release of ATP from cultured as-
trocytes by glutamate, or by NMDA, AMPA or kainate-specific
agonists was described by Queiroz et al. (1997). With addi-
tion of 100 M glutamate they found an average ATP release
of 0.3­0.4 pmol/min per mg of protein, but higher gluta-
mate concentrations raised this value. (iii) Maienschein et al.
(1999) confirmed release of ATP from cultured astrocytes
by receptor-mediated mechanisms and suggested vesicular
exocytosis as a potential mechanism of the release. These
observations are important for astrocytic function, since one
mechanism for the propagation of Ca2 + waves in astrocytes
is by release of ATP (Leybaert and Sanderson, 2012), which
subsequently activates purinergic receptors on adjacent cells
(Cotrina et al., 2000). (iv) ATP release from cultured astro-
cytes was again found to be Ca2 + -dependent by Bal-Price
et al. (2002), who also described that a portion of astro-
cytic ATP is packaged in secretory granules. (v) Pangsric et al.
(2007) showed punctate expression in cultured astrocytes of
ATP-containing vesicles, which after glutamate stimulation
fused with the plasma membrane in a Ca2 + -dependent man-
ner, leading to release of ATP. (vi) Pryazhnikov and Khi-
roug (2008) showed that exocytosis of ATP from cultured
astrocytes was triggered by receptor stimulation or Ca2 +

uncaging, but occurred after a delay, with only approximately
4% of the release during the first 30 s. (vii) In intact brain
slices the time interval is even longer (Heinrich et al., 2012)
suggesting activation of Ca2 + -dependent signaling. (vii) Re-
lease of ATP from astrocytes gently isolated from brain slices
(Lalo et al., 2006) has been demonstrated (Lalo et al., 2011).
For studies of the role of glycogen in ATP release from brain
slices or astrocytes obtained from brain slices it is important
to remember that glycogen content may become drastically
reduced when the animal is killed and only recover in the
slices after at least 2 h of incubation (LeBaron, 1955).
Glycogenolysis is Ca2 + -dependent, not only in muscle
(Ozawa, 1972, 2011) but also in brain slices (Ververken et al.,
1982) and leukocytes (Herlin et al., 1978). Glycogenolysis is
an astrocyte-specific process (Gibbs et al., 2006), which is
important for brain function both on account of its require-
ment for formation of transmitter glutamate (Gibbs et al.,
2006) and because Na+ ,K+ -ATPase-mediated K+ uptake
in cultured astrocytes require glycogenolysis-dependent sig-
naling (Xu et al., 2013). An intense K+ uptake triggered by
extracellular K+ concentrations above 15 mM, which is me-
diated by activation of the Na+ , K+ , Cl- and water trans-
porter NKCC1, and is secondary to depolarization-mediated
opening of L-channels for Ca2 + (Yan et al., 2013), also re-
quires glycogenolysis. We therefore wondered whether K+ -
stimulated and perhaps also transmitter-stimulated ATP re-
lease might require glycogenolysis.
In the present paper this was studied by measuring ATP
release from cultured astrocytes by a luciferin/luciferase
method in the presence and absence of the glycogenoly-
sis inhibitor 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB), with
and without stimulation. In addition to testing the generally
used but pathologically high K+ concentration of 45 mM we
also tested whether a smaller effect could be obtained after
addition of 10 mM K+ , reaching a less pathological extra-
cellular K+ concentration of 15 mM, and whether this effect
might be increased by -aminobutyric acid (GABA) which is
depolarizing in astrocytes and causes an increase in [Ca2 + ]i
(Bekar and Walz, 2002; Meier et al., 2008; Young et al., 2010;
Ma et al., 2012; Egawa et al., 2013). GABA was also tested
alone, as were the two other transmitters glutamate and
adenosine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Chemicals for preparation of medium and most other chem-
icals, including DAB, adenosine, glutamate, the glutamate
receptor antagonist MPEP [2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-
pyridine], GABA and the ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL67156
were purchased from Sigma. The inhibitor of MEK [MAPK
(mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-
regulated kinase) kinase] U0126 was obtained from Cal-
biochem.
Cell culture
Primary cultures of astrocytes were prepared from the
neopallia of the cerebral hemispheres as previously described
(Juurlink and Hertz, 1992) with minor modifications (Xu et al.,
2013) and planted in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's Minimum
Essential Medium (DMEM) with 7.5 mM glucose (to allow
some decline between feedings) and the 5.4 mM K+ tra-
ditionally used in our cultures. After the age of 2 weeks,
0.25 mM dibutyryl cAMP (dBcAMP) was included in the
medium. Such cultures are highly enriched in astrocytes
(>95% purity of glial fibrillary protein- (GFAP-) and glu-
tamine synthetase-expressing astrocytes (Hertz et al., 1985).
The addition of dBcAMP at this specific stage of culturing
is a crucial component of our culture preparation. It leads
to a morphological and functional differentiation, as evi-
denced by the extension of cell processes, increases in sev-
eral metabolic activities and expression of voltage sensitive
L-channels for calcium (Ca2 + ), features which are charac-
teristic of astrocytes in situ (Hertz, 1990; Meier et al., 1991,
Yan et al., 2013). Use of astrocyte cultures has recently been
authoritatively reviewed (Lange et al., 2012), and in our own
cultures drug-induced changes in gene expression and edit-
ing have recently been confirmed in freshly isolated cells
from mice treated with the same drugs (Li et al., 2012b; Song
et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2013). Moreover the development of
the glutamate/aspartate exchanger component aralar shows
similar developmental patterns in the two preparations, with
an increase in the cultured cells after dBcAMP administration
(Li et al., 2012a).
Luciferin/luciferase ATP assay
For determination of the extracellular ATP, a lu-
ciferin/luciferase assay (ENLITEN ATP Assay System Biolumi-
nesecence Detection Kit, Promega) and a Tecan infinite M200
Microplate Analyzer were used to record relative light units
(RLU) as described by Liu et al., (2008). Firefly luciferase cat-
alyzes the oxidation of luciferin in the presence of ATP to
produce light. For determination of ATP release the culture
medium in 24-well plates was replaced with 180 l of DMEM
without pH indicator and serum but retaining its normal glu-
cose content. To most of the incubation media an inhibitor
of ecto-ATPase (ARL67156) was added at the beginning of
the incubation. At the same time the glycogenolysis inhibitor
(DAB) was added to some cultures. Fifteen minutes later a 60
min-incubation with drugs or excess K+ was begun by gen-
tly adding 20 l of glutamate (1 mM in DMEM, to achieve
a final concentration of 100 M), of adenosine (1 mM in
DMEM, to achieve a final concentration of 100 M), of GABA
(1 mM in DMEM, to achieve a final concentration of 100 M),
or of KCl (either 450 mM in DMEM to achieve a final K+

Role of glycogenolysis in stimulation of ATP release from cultured mouse astrocytes
concentration of 50 mM or 100 mM in DMEM to achieve a
final K+ concentration of 15 mM).
At the end of the 60-min experimental period a 100 l
aliquot of the incubation medium was quickly removed and
its temperature reduced to 37C for the ATP assay. It was
mixed with a 100 l aliquot of luciferin/luciferase reagent
dissolved in dilution buffer provided with the assay kit, and
chemiluminescence values (RLU) were recorded. Ionic salt
sensitivity of the luciferase reaction was negligible, and it
was not sensitive to DAB or other drugs employed in the
present study (J. Xu, L. Hertz and L. Peng, unpublished work).
However, even in the absence of any known ATP, consider-
able relative high RLU readings were caused by the medium
and/or cultures (ATP is found in many compounds), and this
varied slightly between experiments. A correction for RLUs
that were independent of ATP release was introduced by
adjusting the baseline of each figure, assuming that the rel-
atively small ATP release under control conditions remained
constant. This procedure ensures that relative changes are
measured reasonably accurately. For calculation of absolute
ATP levels, sample RLU readings were in some cases compared
with RLU values obtained from standard solutions of ATP.
Statistics
The statistical values of the differences between individ-
ual groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by
Fisher's LSD test. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS
Effects of DAB
Without any tissue the incubation medium caused RLU values
between 1200 and 1600 (J. Xu, L. Hertz and L. Peng, unpub-
lished work) for the reasons discussed above. In Figure 1 all
values are therefore indicated from a baseline of 1500. Un-
der control conditions, without any ecto-ATPase inhibitor,
there is virtually no visible increase in RLU (Figure 1). How-
ever, in the presence of the ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL 67156
there is an increase of 300 units, suggesting that a nor-
mally occurring small ATP release is obscured by ecto-ATPase
action. An effect similar to that of ARL 67156 was caused by
DAB, which might suggest that ecto-ATPase action requires
glycogenolysis. This possibility was not further investigated,
except by showing that the effects of ARL 67156 and DAB
were not additive. In all remaining results of Figure 1 ARL
67156 was present. They illustrate the effects of 100 M
glutamate, 100 M adenosine or an elevation of the extra-
cellular K+ concentration by 45 mM (to a total of 50 mM). In
the absence of DAB either agent increased RLU by up to 1000
RLU units, and this effect was almost completely inhibited by
DAB.
Figure 1 Glycogenolysis is required for the increase of ATP release from
well differentiated astrocyte cultures induced by the addition of
glutamate to a final concentration of 100 M, adenosine to a final
concentration of 100 M or elevation of the extracellular K+
concentration by 45 mM
The presence of any of these stimuli during incubation for 60 min in
glucose-containing (7.5 mM) DMEM supplemented with the ecto-ATPase
inhibitor ARL67156 increased the content of ATP, measured as RLU by a lu-
ciferin/luciferase technique. This increase was almost abolished in the addi-
tional presence of the glycogenolysis inhibitor (DAB). Results are the averages
of RLU values from three to five individual cultures. S.E.M. values are indicated
by vertical bars. *Statistically significant (P < 0.05) difference from all other
groups, but not from each other.
A standard curve (not shown) was used to estimate the
corresponding amounts of ATP. It showed that 300 RLU units
under control conditions corresponds 0.3 nM and that a
further increase of 1000 units under stimulated conditions
equals 5 nM. Since this value was obtained after a 1:1 di-
lution and the total volume of incubation was 200 l, the
total amount of ATP in the incubation medium must have
increased by about 2 pmol. With a protein content of 35 g
per culture the amount of ATP released in response to glu-
tamate during 60 min would thus amount to 60 pmol or
1.0 pmol/min per mg of protein. In the following two fig-
ures, ARL 67156 was present in all experiments to prevent
ecto-ATPase activity. The ATP release shown in Figure 2 in re-
sponse to glutamate was somewhat smaller than in Figure 1,
perhaps reflecting differences in protein content in the cul-
tures. However, it was still at least as high as the release
found by Queiroz et al. (1997) in response to 100 M gluta-
mate. Addition of either the glutamate receptor antagonist
MPEP or U0126 completely inhibited the glutamate-evoked
increase in extracellular ATP. We have previously shown that
MPEP inhibits glutamatergic signaling in astrocytes (Peng
et al., 2012), and U0126 is a MEK inhibitor, which prevents
phosphorylation of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 phosphorylation must ac-
cordingly constitute an important part of the glutamate-
stimulated pathway leading to ATP release.
Figure 3 shows that addition of 10 mM K+ caused a
smaller release of ATP (about 300 RLU or 0.3 pmol ATP/min
per mg of protein) than exposure to higher K+ concentra-
tions, and it made little difference whether or not GABA was
also present. This release of ATP was abolished by nifedipine

Figure 2 Glutamate-stimulated ATP release from astrocytes requires
GluK2 activation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
The cells were treated as described in Figure 1 with the addition of glutamate to
a final concentration of 100 M glutamate, and the inhibitor of ecto-ATPase,
ARL67156, present in all experiments. Some experiments were performed in
the additional presence of either 25 M MPEP, an antagonist of mGluR5 and
GluK2 receptors, or 10 M U0126, a specific inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation
(by inhibition of MEK). For undetermined reasons the ATP release in response
to glutamate was smaller than in Figure 1, but the main result is that it was
completely prevented by either inhibitor. Literature data indicate that mGluR5
is not functioning in differentiated cells. Results are averages of RLU values
from three individual cultures. S.E.M. values are indicated by vertical bars.

(Figure 3), a dihydropyridine inhibitor of L-channels for
Ca2 + , opened by depolarization and leading to an increase
in free cytosolic Ca2 + concentration (Ca2 + ) (Yan et al.,
2013). GABA alone seemed to cause a very small increase in
ATP release, but it was far from being statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
Abrogation of K+ -stimulated release of ATP by inhibition
of glycogenolysis could have been expected, since the L-
channel-mediated pathway opened by the addition of 45 mM
K+ (Cai et al., 2011) is inhibited when glycogenolysis is pre-
vented (Xu et al., 2013). L-channel function is also known to
be dependent on energy metabolism (Kostyuk, 1984). Eleva-
tion of extracellular K+ concentrations cause an increase in
glycogenolysis both in intact brain tissue (Hof et al., 1988) and
in cell cultures that have been treated with dBcAMP (Sub-
barao et al., 1995). The present study showed that also K+
addition resulting in a more physiologically relevant K+ con-
centration (10 mM) caused a significant release of ATP, which
was completely inhibited by nifedipine. GABA alone had no
significant effect and only slightly and non-significantly in-
creased that of elevated extracellular K+ concentrations. The
relatively small depolarization it causes seems insufficient to
evoke ATP release.
The glycogenolysis-dependent pathways activated by glu-
tamate and adenosine in astrocytes are unknown. The present
study showed inhibition by the glutamate antagonist MPEP
and by an ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor. MPEP is gener-
ally known as an inhibitor of mGluR5, a metabotropic glu-
Figure 3 The cells were treated as described in Figure 2 but instead of
adding glutamate the extracellular K+ concentration was increased by
10 mM, in some experiments together with the addition of GABA to a
final concentration of 100 M
Either the addition of 10 mM K+ alone or the combined addition of K+ and
GABA increased ATP release, although to a smaller degree than the higher,
more depolarizing K+ concentration used in Figure 1. The response required
L-Ca2 + channel activation, as indicated by its inhibition by 100 nM nifedip-
ine, a dihydropyridine inhibitor of depolarization-opened L-channels for Ca2 +
leading to increase in Ca2 + . Results are averages of RLU values from three

tamate receptor, but this receptor is only functioning in as-
trocytes during very early development (Sun et al., 2013).
MPEP appears also to inhibit the kainate receptor GluK2,
present in mature astrocytes in vivo (Li et al., 2012a) and
active in culture (Li et al., 2011). GluK2 is equally distributed
in freshly isolated neurons and astrocytes (Li et al., 2012a).
The signaling pathway for the GluK2 receptor in astrocytes
has not been determined, but glutamate increases [Ca2 + ]i
in the presently used astrocytes (Li et al., 2011). However, in
astrocytic transmitter pathways examined so far ERK1/2
phosphorylation is downstream of an increase in [Ca2 + ]i
and subsequent transactivation of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) (Peng, 2004; Peng et al., 2010). An
inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation abolished glutamate-
induced release of ATP, and we have evidence that inhi-
bition of post-transamination signaling does not interfere
with pre-transactivation signaling (J. Xu, L. Hertz and L.
Peng, unpublished work). Accordingly, it can be concluded
that increase in [Ca2 + ]i
is necessary, but not sufficient, for
GluK2-mediated ATP release. Precise identification of the
glycogenolysis-dependent step is therefore a major under-
taking, beyond the scope of the present study.
Glutamate has been reported not to cause glycogenol-
ysis in cultured astrocytes (Sorg and Magistretti, 1991).
Consistent with this observation, 100 M glutamate (the
concentration used in this study) causes relatively little
glycogenolysis also in our cultures, although it had a pro-
nounced glycogenolytic effect at 1 mM (J. Xu, L. Hertz
and L. Peng, unpublished work), perhaps due to massive
glycogenolysis-requiring extrusion of K+ accumulated to-
gether with glutamate. In this context it is of interest that

Role of glycogenolysis in stimulation of ATP release from cultured mouse astrocytes
Queiroz et al. (1997) noted increased release of ATP when the
glutamate concentration was raised beyond 100 M.
Adenosine causes a stimulation of glycogenolysis in cul-
tured astrocytes and brain slices, and at least in the cul-
tured cells the stimulation is dependent upon cAMP signaling
(Magistretti et al., 1986; Sorg and Magistretti, 1991), i.e. stim-
ulation of an A2
receptor (van Calker et al., 1979). Both an A2A
and an A2B
receptor are now known to exist. A2A
adenosine
receptors mediate their effects predominantly through cou-
pling to adenylyl cyclase, but at least in some cells their acti-
vation might also induce formation of inositol phosphates, a
rise in [Ca2 + ]i
and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (Of-
fermanns and Simon, 1995). This is important because cAMP
as previously described can not induce glycogenolysis in the
absence of an increase in [Ca2 + ]i
(Ozawa, 1972; 2011; Her-
lin et al., 1978; Ververken et al., 1982). However, Ca2 + can
also enter the cell through receptors (Neary et al., 1988).
Such a mechanism might perhaps explain why Kanno and
Nisizaki (2012) found the release of glutamate and increase
in [Ca2 + ]i
in cultured astrocytes in response to adenosine to
require protein kinase A function but not Ca2 + release from
either InsP3
or ryanodine receptors. Whether this applies also
for the present release of ATP is unknown.
