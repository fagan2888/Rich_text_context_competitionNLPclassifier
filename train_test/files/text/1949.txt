"The only thing we have in common is our obedience to
certain fundamental biologic laws which govern all men [sic]."
Hans Selye, The Stress of Life, 1976, p. 454.
HANS Selye was correct in his observation that all peo-
ple face similar biological changes across the life span,
and nowhere is this more evident than in later adulthood.
Hair grays, walking slows, faces wrinkle, and rates of ill-
nesses increase. Yet, there is variability in these seemingly
inevitable changes. Understanding why this variability
exists and attempting to identify the factors that determine
why some people age well and others do not has demanded
innovation from aging researchers interested in psychophys-
iology. For years, self-reported measures of physical health
dominated biopsychosocial data collection, and such mea-
sures continue to garner important information regarding
the association between psychological and physical health
across adulthood. Certain questions, however, cannot be
answered with self-reported measures alone and, instead,
require the collection of physiological data. To this end,
biomarkers that reflect underlying physiological processes
are being utilized in several research laboratories that focus
on stress, health, and aging.
A biomarker is defined as a biological indicator--such as
blood or saliva--that reflects underlying physiological pro-
cesses, including both normative processes and pathogenic
states (Baum & Grunberg, 1997). For example, elevated
blood pressure is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease,
elevated proinflammatory cytokines are biomarkers of
inflammation, and elevated body temperature is a biomarker
of infection. Biomarker assessments have become increas-
ingly popular among behavioral and social aging research-
ers as a way to connect behavioral, environmental, and
social factors to an individual's health and well-being
(Gruenewald & Kemeny, 2007). In fact, the National Institutes
of Health encourages research that assesses multiple behav-
ioral and psychosocial pathways to health and well-being--
a task that requires an integration of biological and social
science (Singer & Ryff, 2001). Biomarkers play a pivotal
role in this journey, and the goal of this article is to provide
researchers with an understanding of how biomarkers in-
form research on stress, health, and aging.
This article is divided into three broad sections. In the
first section, we discuss how stressors of different domains
may affect physical health. In the second section, we review
three systems closely implicated in stress functioning (i.e.,
the sympathetic­adrenal­medullary [SAM] axis, the hypo-
thalamic­pituitary­adrenal [HPA] axis, and the immune
system) and discuss normative age-related changes that
occur in each system. Page restrictions prohibit an exhaus-
tive review of the literature, so we provide tables that describe
the function and age-related changes of specific biomarkers
and refer the reader to resources mentioned in text for more
detailed information. In this section, we also address the
impact psychological stress has on these systems and how it
may accelerate age-related physical health declines. In the
last section, we discuss the future of biomarkers and pro-
pose that researchers studying stress, health, and aging take
a multivariate and dynamic approach.
Stressor Domains: Life Events, Chronic
Stressors, and Daily Hassles
There are two major approaches to examining the inter-
relationships between stress, health, and aging. The first
approach focuses on major life events that are relatively rare
in their occurrence and that require significant life adjust-
ments, such as divorce or the death of a spouse (e.g., Dohren-
wend, 2006; Holmes & Rahe, 1967; Wheaton, 1997).
The second approach focuses on everyday events, or quo-
tidian stressors (Almeida, 2005; Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli,
2003; Pearlin, 1999), which are divided into two types:
chronic stressors and daily hassles. Whereas chronic stressors

Assessment of biomarkers that reflect objective indicators of physiological processes has become increasingly
popular in psychological research on stress and aging. The current article reviews biomarkers of the neuroendocrine
and immune systems, including issues related to measurement and normative age-related changes. We also discuss
how exposure to stressors can provoke changes in these biomarkers and propose that stressful experiences may
accelerate age-related declines in these systems. We recommend that future research examining physical health
and aging incorporate dynamic and multivariate methods for assessing links between stressors and biomarkers.

refer to ongoing persistent situations, such as caregiving for
an ill spouse, daily stressors refer to minor events that arise
from day-to-day living, such as meeting work deadlines
(see review by Almeida, Piazza, Stawski, & Klein, in press).
The mechanisms through which different types of stressors
exert an effect on health vary, with life events associated
with prolonged arousal and daily stressors associated with
spikes in arousal (Almeida et al.). Not surprisingly, how-
ever, these constructs overlap. Take, for instance, the ex-
ample of spousal caregiving. In this situation, a life
event--that is, one's spouse being diagnosed with an ill-
ness--leads to the chronic stress of caregiving, which, in
turn, results in increased exposure to daily stressors related
to caregiving responsibilities. Indeed, many researchers
suggest that it is the interaction and accumulation of stres-
sors that lead to poor health outcomes over time (e.g.,
Almeida & Wong, 2009; Chiriboga, 1997; Pearlin, Menag-
han, Lieberman, & Mullan, 1981).
In and of itself, the stress response does not lead to ad-
verse health outcomes; rather, it protects an organism from
harm by increasing alertness, mobilizing energy, and pro-
tecting against pathogens. Each time the stress response is
activated, however, physiological adjustments must be
made, and over time, these adjustments may lead to cumu-
lative wear and tear (McEwen, 1998). Exposure to stressors
may, therefore, accelerate the aging process, particularly
when this exposure occurs in later adulthood, as physiolog-
ical systems are already compromised. In the following sec-
tion, we discuss this view in greater detail and also provide
an overview of the biomarkers implicated in the stress
response.
The SAM Axis, the HPA Axis, and the Immune
System: A Brief Review
SAM Axis
Cannon (1914) was the first to describe hormones as bio-
markers of stress when he detailed the physiological "fight-
or-flight" response (Cannon, 1932; Cannon, Britton, Lewis, &
Groeneveld, 1927). The fight-or-flight response begins
with the activation of the sympathetic (SNS) branch of the
autonomic nervous system (see Figure 1), which stimulates
the release of the catecholamines, epinephrine (EPI) and
norepinephrine (NE), from sympathetic neurons and the
adrenal medulla (for review, see Klein & Corwin, 2007);
this SNS-stimulated release of EPI and NE from the adrenal
medulla is also known as the SAM axis. Effects of EPI and
NE include decreased blood flow to the organs of the gas-
trointestinal tract, the skin, and the kidneys, which ensures
maximum blood flow to the brain, heart, and skeletal
muscles when a stressor is encountered.
Table 1 provides a description of several biomarkers of
the SAM axis. Circulating or excreted levels of EPI and
NE are the primary biomarkers of SAM axis activity
(Baum & Grunberg, 1997) and can be measured reliably in
urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid samples. Circulating
catecholamines are metabolized quickly (within 1­3 min)
and indicate immediate changes in SAM axis activation.
The invasive nature of blood sampling, as well as the short
half-life and high frequency of pulse-like fluctuations in
catecholamines, make it challenging to track circulating
catecholamines outside of the laboratory. Analysis of urine
provides a relatively noninvasive measure of catecholamine
levels, and home collection of urine by participants has
been used successfully in many field studies of chronic
stress (e.g., Baum, Gatchel, & Schaeffer, 1983; Cohen,
Doyle, & Baum, 2006; Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,
1999). Because catecholamines are secreted slowly (over
hours) while the bladder fills, however, urinary cate-
cholamine assessments provide a relatively static index of
SAM axis activity, which makes it difficult to examine the
impact of stressor onset and cessation (Baum & Grunberg;
Mason, 1968).
A rapidly growing literature suggests that the salivary en-
zyme a-amylase (sAA) can serve as a minimally invasive
surrogate marker of SNS activity (for reviews, see Granger,
Kivlighan, El-Sheikh, Gordis, & Stroud, 2007; Nater &
Rohleder, 2009). The rationale is that catecholamine release
in response to SNS activation stimulates salivary gland re-
ceptors that, in turn, alter activity of these glands (Nederfors
& Dahlof, 1992). Although the main function of sAA is the
enzymatic digestion of carbohydrates (Rohleder & Nater,
2009), sAA appears to be a viable surrogate marker of SAM
axis activation, as it parallels stress-related increases in NE
5­10 min after NE release (Rohleder, Nater, Wolf, Ehlert, &
Kirschbaum, 2004). With regard to diurnal patterns, sAA
exhibits moderately low levels upon awakening, drops
briefly at 30-min post-awakening and increases gradually
throughout the day (Nater, Rohleder, Schlotz, Ehlert, &
Kirschbaum, 2007).
Age Differences and Changes in SAM Axis Functioning
A number of normative age-related changes occur in the
cardiovascular and sympathetic nervous systems, partly
due to changes in SAM axis functioning (for reviews, see
Crimmins, Vasunilashorn, Kim, & Alley, 2008; Uchino,
Birmingham, & Berg, 2010). Systolic and diastolic blood
pressure gradually increases across the adult life span until
approximately age 70 years, at which time the increase ap-
pears to cease. Resting heart rate remains relatively stable
across adulthood, whereas maximum heart rate gradually
decreases (Uchino et al.). In response to acute psychosocial
stressors, older age is associated with increased systolic
blood pressure and modest increases in diastolic blood
pressure (Uchino, Holt-Lunstad, Bloor, & Campo, 2005;
Uchino et al.). In contrast, heart rate response to physical
exercise and psychosocial stressors is attenuated in older
age (for review, see Ferrari, Radaelli, & Centola, 2003).

Fewer studies have examined age-related changes in
baseline catecholamine levels and in catecholamine reactiv-
ity to stressors. Of those that have, age appears to be associ-
ated with higher average NE levels (e.g., Barnes, Raskind,
Gumbrecht, & Halter, 1982; Blandini et al., 1992), an
increase that may occur due to age-related increases in
basal sympathetic NE activity and reduced metabolic clear-
ance (i.e., neuronal reuptake) of NE among older adults
(Seals & Esler, 2000). In contrast, basal EPI activity is
reduced in older age (e.g., Esler et al., 1995), but lower

levels are not always evident because of reduced clearance
of EPI in later adulthood (Seals & Esler). Older age is gen-
erally associated with higher NE reactivity to stressors
(Barnes et al.; Palmer, Ziegler, & Lake, 1978) and possibly
lower EPI reactivity to stressors (e.g., Esler et al.). Not all
studies illustrate these patterns, however (e.g., Lindheim et
al., 1992), and an examination of individual differences may
help to elucidate these results. In addition, the diurnal in-
crease and deceleration of the diurnal increase of sAA are
attenuated from young adulthood to midlife (Nater et al.,
2007), though recent studies suggest no age differences in
basal sAA levels (for review, see Rohleder & Nater, 2009).
Psychological Stress and the SAM Axis
As previously described, the SAM axis is the body's
primary physiological response to acute stressors (for
review, see Klein & Corwin, 2007). Following the experience
of a stressor, NE slows digestion and gastrointestinal motility,
increases plasma glucose levels, and dilates pupils, whereas
EPI increases heart rate and cardiac contractility, relaxes
smooth muscle, and increases blood pressure and glucose re-
lease. The rise in catecholamine levels depends on stressor
severity, doubling in their resting levels during daily activi-
ties, and rising to three to five times their resting levels during
moderately severe stressors (for review, see Frankenhaeuser,
1971). Other important determinants of SAM axis reactivity
are various stressor characteristics, such as stressor control-
lability, pleasantness, uncertainty, and elicitation of fear or
anger (e.g., Frankenhaeuser & Rissler, 1970; Patkai, 1971).
As stressors increase in chronicity, the frequency and length
of sympathetic activation also increases, possibly resulting in
tissue damage. Several studies indicate that the effect of
chronic stressors on the SAM axis resembles age-related
changes, as evidenced by higher diastolic blood pressure
(Jeckel et al., 2010), higher blood pressure reactivity (Chida
& Hamer, 2008), higher sAA reactivity (Bosch et al., 1998),
and blunted diurnal profiles of NE (Fujiwara et al., 2004;
Hawk, Dougall, Ursano, & Baum, 2000), EPI (Hawk et al.),
and sAA (Nater et al., 2007; Rohleder, Marin, Ma, & Miller,
2009) among people experiencing elevated levels of chronic
or perceived stress.
HPA Axis
Whereas SAM axis activation is designed for an immedi-
ate response to threat, HPA axis activation is a longer-term
hormonal response that is observed approximately 15­20
min following stressor onset (see review by Dickerson &
Kemeny, 2004). Once a stressor is perceived by the cerebral
cortex, it alerts the neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of
the hypothalamus to release corticotrophin-releasing hor-
mone (CRH) into the hypothalamic­pituitary portal blood
flow system. CRH travels to the pituitary gland, where it
stimulates the release of the adrenocorticotropin hormone
(ACTH), as well as arginine vasopressin (AVP). Although
AVP acts centrally to support the fight-or-flight response,
ACTH circulates to the cortex of the adrenal glands to stim-
ulate glucocorticoid release, including corticosteroids (e.g.,
cortisol) (for reviews, see Klein & Corwin, 2007; Taylor
et al., 2000). Corticosteroids themselves regulate contin-
ued HPA axis function through a negative feedback loop
by dampening further CRH release from the hypothala-
mus and ACTH release from the anterior pituitary gland.
Ultimately, cortisol mobilizes energy stores, serves as an
anti-inflammatory hormone, and communicates with the
immune system (Chrousos & Gold, 1992; for review, see
Dickerson & Kemeny).
The primary biomarkers of the HPA axis include CRH,
ACTH,cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate(DHEA-S)
and its unsulfated form DHEA, andAVP (see Table 2). CRH
is measured in cerebrospinal fluid, which means that this
biomarker must be measured in controlled clinical settings.
In contrast, ACTH, cortisol, and AVP can be assessed in
blood, and unbound levels of cortisol can be measured in
saliva. The ease of the salivary collection, in conjunction
with cortisol's predictable diurnal pattern--peaking 30­45
min after awakening and gradually decreasing throughout
the day (e.g., Van Cauter, Leproult, & Kupfer, 1996)--have
made it possible for researchers to include this hormone as
a biomarker across a number of laboratory (for reviews,
see Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004; Hellhammer, Wüst, &
Kudielka, 2009) and field studies (e.g., Almeida, Piazza &
Stawski, 2009; Seltzer et al., 2009; Smyth et al., 1997).
Whereas cortisol is a catabolic hormone, DHEA-S is an
anabolic hormone that is thought to be coreleased with cor-
tisol (Granger & Kivlighan, 2003). DHEA-S and its unsul-
fated form, DHEA, are bioactive, work similarly in the body
(Montanini et al., 1988), and can be assayed in cerebrospi-
nal fluid, blood, urine, or saliva. Secreted primarily from the
adrenal cortex in women and men, as well as from the testes
in men, DHEA-S/DHEA is similar to cortisol in that it is
released in response to ACTH stimulation as part of the
HPA axis, making it a potential moderator of the HPA axis
response to stress (Roberts, 1999). Similar to cortisol,
DHEA-S levels are highest in the morning and decline
throughout the day (Hucklebridge, Hussain, Evans, & Clow,
2005; Klein et al., 2008).
Age Differences and Changes in HPA Axis Functioning
Table 2 lists some of the age-associated changes that
occur in the HPA axis. Increasing age is associated with
higher mean cortisol levels, a disruption of the negative
feedback loop, and a relatively flat diurnal pattern (for re-
views, see Chahal & Drake, 2007; Epel, Burke, & Wolkowitz,
2007). With age, cortisol appears to exhibit an attenuated
awakening response (e.g., Kudielka & Kirschbaum, 2003;Van
Cauter et al., 1996; but see Almeida et al., 2009, Wust et al.,
2000) and a less steep decline in the evening hours, resulting
in a higher nadir (Deuschle et al., 1997; Van Cauter et al.).
BIOMARKERS OF HEALTH 517
Several studies also suggest that age is associated with
greater HPA axis reactivity to stressors (e.g., Otte et al.,
2005; Peskind et al., 1995), although this is not always the
case (e.g., Kudielka, Schmidt-Reinwald, Hellhammer,
Schurmeyer, & Kirschbaum, 2000; Nicolson, Storms,
Ponds, & Sulon, 1996). More research is needed to ascer-
tain age differences in DHEA-S/DHEA, but some studies
suggest that levels steadily decline from early (i.e., 20­30
years old) to later adulthood (i.e., 70­80 years old) (Labrie,
Belanger, Cusan, Gomez, & Candas, 1997).
Psychological Stress and the HPA Axis
HPA axis activation is adaptive in the short term, but
repeated or prolonged activation can have detrimental ef-
fects on health, and lead to a dysregulation of the nega-
tive feedback loop. Specifically, prolonged exposure to
stressors appears to uncouple cortisol from its ability to
inhibit further CRH and ACTH secretion, which leads to
an overproduction of cortisol (Dickerson & Kemeny,
2004). Elevations in cortisol, in turn, are associated with
chronic health problems, psychological disorders, and
problems with memory, learning, and attention (Sapolsky,
1996, 2000).
The changes that occur in the HPA axis as a result of ex-
posure to chronic stressors appear to be similar to the
changes that occur during the aging process. For example,
the experience of trauma, persistent or chronic stressors, or
stressors of high magnitude are associated with greater
cortisol and ACTH reactivity (Rasmusson et al., 2004), a
blunted diurnal rhythm of salivary cortisol (Adam &
Gunnar, 2001; Bergman, Ahmad, & Stewart, 2008; Miller,
Chen, & Zhou, 2007; Ranjit, Young, & Kaplan, 2005;
Seltzer et al., 2009), lower evening DHEA levels (van
Niekerk, Huppert, & Herbert, 2001), and lower overall
DHEA-S levels (Jeckel et al., 2010), although there are
exceptions to these findings (e.g., Miller et al., 2009;
Rohleder et al., 2009; Young & Breslau, 2004).
The Immune System
Just as the SAM and HPA axes are essential to the stress
response, so too is the immune system. The immune system
protects the body from a variety of internal (e.g., defective
cells) and external threats (e.g., bacteria) by destroying
pathogens. It comprises two interrelated branches referred
to as innate and adaptive immunity. The innate branch of the
immune system provides the first line of defense against in-
fection and includes cells and proteins that are nonspecific
to particular antigens and include--but are not limited to--
natural killer (NK) cells, phagocytes, and complement.
Because of their nonspecificity, these cells and proteins are
the first to mount a defense against pathogens. They also
trigger a response by the adaptive branch of the immune
system via cytokine communication. The adaptive branch
creates antigen-specific immunity; therefore, it responds to

threats more slowly. During initial antigen exposure, this
branch responds by developing lymphocytes with a high de-
gree of specificity and "memory" for the challenge, so that
if the pathogen returns, a subset of lymphocytes can respond
more rapidly. The adaptive branch consists of two major
groups of cells: lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells.
The two major populations of lymphocytes are T lympho-
cytes, which are responsible for the antigen-specific killing
of infected cells, and B lymphocytes, which are responsible
for the mass production of antigen-specific antibodies. Be-
cause the innate and adaptive branches work in tandem,
decrements in one branch can compromise the efficacy of
the other (for reviews, see Bauer, Jeckel, & Luz, 2009;
Graham, Christian, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2006; Segerstrom &

system have been identified, Table 3 lists and describes
those that have received the most attention in the stress and
aging literature.
Age Differences and Changes in the Immune System
The immune system is highly efficient for the first 40
years of life, at which time certain aspects begin to show
functional declines (i.e., immunosenescence; Aw, Silva, &
Palmer, 2006). Had life expectancy remained unchanged
from the turn of the 20th century--when people could
expect to live an average of 50 years--understanding why
and how the immune system changes with age would be

unnecessary. Yet, over the last century, life expectancy has
nearly doubled (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
National Center for Health Statistics, 2007), and the result-
ing health implications of a less than optimal immune sys-
tem are apparent. Consequences of immunosenescence
include higher rates of most illnesses, including cancer
(Huang, Patel, & Manton, 2005), osteoporosis and arthritis
(Aw et al.), increased susceptibility to infectious disease
(Weiskopf, Weinberger, & Grubeck-Loebenstein, 2009),
and less efficacious responses to vaccinations (Kovaiou,
Herndler-Brandstetter, & Grubeck-Loebenstein, 2007).
Despite the known health consequences of immunosenes-
cence, the study of immune biomarkers in aging research
has developed relatively recently (see review by Graham
et al., 2006) and suggests that there are certain biomarkers
implicated in immunosenescence.
In terms of the innate branch, research indicates that with
age, cells involved in phagocytosis (e.g., macrophages) be-
come less effective, levels of complement decrease, and
although there are increases in the number of NK cells,
there is also a decrease in their functionality (Kovaiou et al.,
2007). The adaptive branch also undergoes age-related
changes. The thymus gland shrinks with age, and as a result,
fewer naive T cells are produced. Although the percentage
of T cells does not decrease with age, the proportion of
memory T cells (i.e., those cells that are only activated by a
previously encountered antigen) and naive T cells (i.e.,
those cells that respond to novel pathogens) is altered, such
that the number of memory T cells is greater than the num-
ber of naive T cells. A similar pattern occurs among the
B lymphocytes, which also become less able to produce an-
tibodies (for reviews, see Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2004;
Kiecolt-Glaser & Glaser, 2001; Kovaiou et al.; Pfister &
Savino, 2008). With fewer lymphocytes able to respond to
newly introduced pathogens, an individual becomes less
able to fend off new immunologic threats, resulting in
increased morbidity and mortality (Weiskopf et al., 2009).
In contrast to the declines that occur in some components
of the immune system, those aspects that promote inflam-
mation, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis
factor-
, and C-reactive protein (CRP), typically increase
with age (Graham et al., 2006), resulting in concomitant
age-related diseases associated with inflammation, such as
osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and atherosclerosis (Huang et al.,
2005).
Psychological Stress and the Immune System
Psychological stressors activate a number of changes in
the immune system, and these alterations vary according to
stressor duration, with short-term stressors provoking tran-
sient changes in the immune system, and progressively
longer lasting stressors triggering greater changes (for review,
see Segerstrom & Miller, 2004). In the face of an acute chal-
lenge, the immune system readies itself for possible exposure
to pathogens, resulting in an upregulation of some aspects
of innate immunity and a decrease in lymphocyte prolifera-
tion. These transient changes downregulate approximately
1 hr after the threat ceases and are evolutionarily adaptive,
as they protect an organism from impending threat (Kiecolt-
Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser, 2002). As the duration
of stressors increases, however, such as during examination
periods or when undergoing residential relocation, more ro-
bust changes in immune biomarkers occur, including low-
ered B-lymphocyte concentrations (McGregor, Antoni,
Ceballos, & Blomberg, 2008), weaker vaccine responses
(Glaser et al., 1992), slower wound healing (e.g., Marucha,
Kiecolt-Glaser, & Favagehi, 1998), and decreased func-
tioning of NK cell activity (Lutgendorf, Vitaliano, Tripp-
Reimer, Harvey, & Lubaroff, 1999). As stressors become
more chronic, the adaptiveness of the stress response begins
to wane. Changes similar to those seen in aging start to
occur, with decreases in adaptive immunity (for review, see
Graham et al., 2006; Segerstrom & Miller), increases in
inflammatory markers, such as proinflammatory cytokines and
CRP (Koster et al., 2006), and decrements in several aspects
of innate immunity (Gomez, Boehmer, & Kovacs, 2005).
Does Chronic Stress Accelerate Aging?
If chronic stress activates biomarker changes that are akin
to those seen in aging, does it also have the potential to exac-
erbate normative age-related changes? Surprisingly, rela-
tively few studies have examined this question, but of those
that have, several suggest that stress does, indeed, exacerbate
the aging process. For example, in their seminal study, Epel,
Burke, and Woskowitz (2004) found that women reporting
higher levels of perceived stress showed accelerated cellular
aging compared to their lower-stressed peers. One intriguing
question that was not explicitly examined in this study, how-
ever, is how age may influence this association. Studies that
have examined the impact of age on the relationship between
stress and health indicate that stress may actually be more
harmful for older as compared to younger adults. For exam-
ple, high job demands appear to be more detrimental to the
health of older employees than to the health of younger em-
ployees (Schnorpfeil et al., 2003). Older adults may also
take longer to physiologically recover from high-stress work
weeks than their younger counterparts (Ritvanen, Louhevaara,
Helin,Vaisanen, & Hanninen, 2006), a finding that coincides
with the self-ratings of older adults who indicate needing
more "recovery time" after work compared with younger
adults (Kiss, De Meester, & Braeckman, 2008). Similarly, in
a study of stressed individuals, age was linearly related to
cortisol levels, indicating that among people exposed to
stressors, older adults were affected to a greater extent than
were their middle-aged counterparts (Jacobs, Mason, Kosten,
Brown, & Ostfeld, 1984).
Studies also suggest that chronic stress may exacerbate
normative aging processes of the immune system (see reviews
PIAZZA ET AL.

by Gruenewald & Kemeny, 2009; Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2004;
Schneiderman, Ironson, & Siegel, 2005; but see Pedersen,
Zechariae, & Bovbjerg, 2009). In one study, for example, the
influenza vaccine was given to caregivers of spouses with
dementia and noncaregiver controls. Noncaregivers were
better able to mount a response to the vaccine than were care-
givers, and among the caregivers, those younger than 70 years
had a stronger response than did those older than 70 years
(Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1996). In contrast, nonelderly caregivers
of relatives with multiple sclerosis did not appear to differ in
their ability to mount a vaccine response than did noncaregiv-
ers (Vedhara et al., 2002). More postsurgery complications
have also been noted among anxious older men when com-
pared with nonanxious older men and both anxious and
nonanxious younger men (Linn, Linn, & Jensen, 1983). Over a
6-year period, Kiecolt-Glaser and colleagues (2003) also found
that spousal caregivers had a fourfold increase in levels of IL-6
compared with noncaregivers. Given that aging is positively
associated with levels of IL-6, this additional increase may
result in even greater health repercussions. Indeed, in a meta-
analysis of over 300 studies examining stress and the immune
system, Segerstrom and Miller (2004) concluded that "aging
likely makes people more susceptible to negative immunologi-
cal effects of stress" (p. 619).
Current research hints at the possibility of chronic stress
exacerbating normative age-related changes in the neuroen-
docrine and immune systems. Not all studies show this
pattern(e.g.,Dijkstra,Charness,Yordon,&Fox,2009;Strahler,
Berndt, Kirschbaum, & Rohleder, 2010), however, so
more work is needed before definitive conclusions can be
drawn. Fortunately, there has been an increase in the
number of large-scale longitudinal studies that collect
both biological and psychological data, which will make
it possible to assess the impact stressor type and duration
have on aging.
Future Directions
Taking a Multivariate View: Allostasis and Allostatic Load
Our review thus far has highlighted how aging, stress,
and the interaction between the two may affect biomarkers
of the SAM axis, the HPA axis, and the immune system.
Rather than operating independently, these systems
interact, leading to dynamic, synergistic effects on the
body. Examining how only one biomarker is related to one
physiological system may provide an unacceptably narrow
understanding of aging and stress. The concepts of allosta-
sis and allostatic load (McEwen, 1998; Sterling & Eyer,
1988) were introduced in recognition of the need to inte-
grate the effects of stress on the entire body and have moved
researchers away from a univariate approach (i.e., use of
one biomarker) of understanding the effects of stress on the
body toward a multivariate approach (i.e., use of multiple
biomarkers).
When faced with external challenges, such as stressful
situations, the human body adapts by altering internal
physiological processes. This process of adjustment and
adaptation to meet external demands is referred to as
allostasis (Sterling & Eyer, 1988). Allostasis is adaptive in
the short term; continual accommodation of physiological
systems in response to stressors, however, may result in
allostatic load or a wearing down of bodily systems due to
constant activity (McEwen, 1998). Operationalization of
allostatic load varies from study to study, but one common
way to measure it is through a summary score that repre-
sents the total number of biomarkers for which an indi-
vidual scores in the uppermost or lowermost extreme (e.g.,
Crimmins, Kim, & Seeman, 2009; Seeman, Singer, Rowe,
Horwitz, & McEwen, 1997). Studies using this method
have shown that the more biomarkers for which a person
scores in the highest risk quartiles, the greater is one's
risk of cognitive and physiological declines, as well as
mortality (e.g., Seeman et al.).
Statistical techniques, such as canonical correlation and
recursive partitioning, have been used to more accurately
account for the multidimensional and complex nature of
allostatic load (e.g., Gruenewald, Seeman, Ryff, Karlamangla,
& Singer, 2006; Karlamangla, Singer, McEwen, Rowe, &
Seeman, 2002). Such methods allow researchers to identify
the biomarkers that are most predictive of the outcome of
interest. In general, however, much of the research on allo-
static load has taken a fairly static view of aging, stressor
exposure, and biomarkers. Because biological processes are
labile and responsive to recent experiences and challenges,
the understanding of aging, stressor exposure, biomarkers,
and allostatic load may benefit from daily diary methods.
Taking a Dynamic View: Daily Stressors, Biomarkers, and
Diary Designs
There are several virtues to daily diary studies (Bolger et al.,
2003), one of the most notable being increased ecological
validity, which oftentimes limits the generalizability of
laboratory research. Given their relatively short-time
frames, daily diary studies also address concerns regard-
ing potential memory biases that may be an issue for ret-
rospective studies with longer time frames. Perhaps most
relevant to the study of stress, health, and aging, however,
is the ability of daily diary studies to assess "within-person
stressor reactivity."
"Stressor reactivity" refers to how people react either
emotionally or physically to daily stressors, and is opera-
tionalized as the within-person association between stres-
sors and a particular outcome--in this case biomarkers
(Almeida, 2005; Cacioppo, 1998). In this sense, stressor re-
activity does not refer to the average level of a given bio-
marker, but rather how biomarkers change as a function of
stressor exposure. For example, prior research demonstrates
that people who are less reactive to daily stressors are also
BIOMARKERS OF HEALTH 521
less susceptible to physical illness than are people who are
more reactive to daily stressors (Cacioppo).A more dynamic
way to approach the study of daily stressor reactivity, how-
ever, is to compare an individual's biomarker levels on stres-
sor days versus stressor-free days. For example, rather than
ask whether caregivers have higher salivary cortisol levels
than do non-caregivers, researchers can examine whether
caregivers' cortisol levels are higher on days when they ex-
perience stressors related to caregiving versus days when
they do not experience caregiving-related stressors (e.g.,
Seltzer et al., 2009). This within-person approach makes it
possible to rule out third variable explanations for the asso-
ciation between stressors and biomarkers, and permits a
temporal examination of these two variables (for review, see
Almeida, McGonagle, & King, 2009).
The next step in this daily approach is to embed inten-
sive repeated measurements in traditional longitudinal de-
signs to tease apart the pathways through which economic,
social, and psychological factors affect daily stressor ex-
posure and reactivity and how they may influence bio-
markers (Almeida et al., 2009). Using data collected over
an extended period of time would allow researchers to ex-
amine how preexisting circumstances may be associated
with daily stress processes and biomarker changes. More-
over, examining the full life course would make it possible
to explore how life cycle variation, in conjunction with
economic and social factors, may alter these pathways
(Almeida & Wong, 2009).
The use of daily diary data may also help researchers
determine the physiological responses that are most adap-
tive to different types of stressors. Some researchers, for
example, suggest that an adaptive response to stress consists
of moderate activity within the SAM and HPA axes, with
either moderate­moderate or high­low activation of the two
systems, in contrast to the less adaptive high­high or low­
low balance (Bauer, Quas, & Boyce, 2002). By collecting
daily diary and biomarker data from the same individuals
over time, it is possible to not only determine the responses
that are most adaptive for people of different ages but
also which biomarker combinations are most predictive
of morbidity and mortality.
A Word of Caution
Clearly, the use of biomarkers in stress, health, and aging
research provides a wealth of information. Yet, researchers
must be well informed of the potential limitations that
accompany this type of data collection. Biomarker assays
tend to be costly, may require specialized training or a
skilled technician, and--in isolation--are not always
indicative of meaningful underlying processes (Mayeux,
2004). In addition, many biomarkers can only be collected
in laboratory settings, thereby limiting the types of phenom-
ena researchers may study. When biomarkers are collected
in the field, however, questions arise regarding participant
compliance and sample integrity. Researchers, therefore,
must decide whether reduced control is outweighed by the
benefit of capturing stress processes as they occur in daily
life. Regardless of where data are collected, proper collec-
tion procedures cannot be overemphasized.Arm movement,
for example, can make blood pressure readings unreliable
(Mourad et al., 2003); saliva collection method (e.g.,
cotton swab vs. passive drool) can affect DHEA-S/DHEA
(Gallagher, Leitch, Massey, McAllister-Williams, &Young,
2006); and caffeine consumption can affect salivary cortisol
levels (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). Finally, it is important
to realize that not all research on stress, health, and aging
requires biomarker data. In many situations, self-reported
health information is not only acceptable but is ideally
suited for the question at hand. Indeed, biomarkers are not a
panacea to all research on stress, health, and aging. Instead,
the use of biomarker data simply allows skilled researchers
a chance to ask questions they may not otherwise be able to
answer.
Summary and Conclusions
The study of stress and biological aging has a rich history.
Over 50 years ago, Selye (1956) wrote in the final pages
of The Stress of Life: "Stress is the sum of all of the
wear and tear caused by any kind of vital reaction through-
out the body at any one time. That is why it can act as a
common denominator of all of the biologic changes which
go on in the body; it is a kind of `speedometer of life'"
(p. 274). The frontier for research on stress and aging is to
assess this speedometer within naturalistic settings across
multiple time frames. Only by examining multiple daily
stressors, in conjunction with individual differences and
biological measures, can researchers determine the ways
specific types of stressors, as well as their duration, are re-
lated to physiological processes across the life span.
