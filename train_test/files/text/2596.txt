Patient-Centered Medical Home
Processes
ABSTRACT The patient-centered medical home has become a prominent
model for reforming the way health care is delivered to patients. The
model offers a robust system of primary care combined with practice
innovations and new payment methods. But scant information exists
about the extent to which typical US physician practices have
implemented this model and its processes of care, or about the factors
associated with implementation. In this article we provide the first
national data on the use of medical home processes such as chronic
disease registries, nurse care managers, and systems to incorporate
patient feedback, among 1,325 small and medium-size physician practices.
We found that on average, practices used just one-fifth of the patient-
centered medical home processes measured as part of this study. We also
identify internal capabilities and external incentives associated with the
greater use of medical home processes.
The patient-centered medical home
model of health care delivery sys-
tem reform was featured promi-
nently in the Affordable Care Act
of 2010. The model was developed
by the primary care specialty societies in 2007.
It has been endorsed by a broad coalition of
purchasers, payers, providers, consumers, and
other health care stakeholders. It emphasizes
a robust system of primary care combined
with practice innovations and new payment
models.1,2
The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Inno-
vation, created under the Affordable Care Act, is
implementing a series of demonstration projects
to test the medical home model in eight states. In
addition, the model is being demonstrated and
implemented in a variety of other settings across
the country.3­6 Early evidence from a small num-
ber of demonstration projects suggests that the
model is having positive effects on both quality
and costs of care.7­11
Joint Principles
The patient-centered medical home is defined
by seven fundamental principles. The first two
principles--that each patient have a personal
physician, and that the model reflect a whole-
person orientation in terms of the care pro-
vided--anticipate that each patient will have an
ongoing relationship with a personal health care
provider who focuses on the whole person, not
on just one disease or body system.
Our study addressed the next four principles,
which emphasize the use of improved care proc-
esses within the physician practice. One princi-
ple is that the personal physician lead a team of
individuals at the practice level who collectively
take responsibility for the ongoing care of pa-
tients.
A second principle is that care be coordinated
and integrated across all elements of the health
care system and the community, facilitated by
the use of patient registries and health informa-
tion technology, such as electronic health rec-

ords. The goal is to make care seamless and well
coordinated among physicians, hospitals, and
other parts of the health system.
A third principle is that the medical practice
focus on quality and safety. According to this
principle, practices will use evidence-based de-
cision support to help health care providers and
patients arrive at optimal care decisions; infor-
mation technology, such as electronic health rec-
ords and e-prescribing; performance feedback to
physicians; active engagement of the practice in
quality improvement activities; patient educa-
tion; and the incorporation of feedback from
patients into providers' decision making.
A fourth principle is that access increase. This
feature includes timely access to care and im-
proved methods of communication, including
e-mail and telephone communication between
patients and physicians.
The final principle, payment reform, encapsu-
lates changes in health care financing and physi-
cian payment systems to support the other com-
ponents of the model. These changes are largely
beyond the control of the individual physician
practice.
Adoption Of Medical Home
Processes
Despite widespread efforts to move forward rap-
idly with pilot projects and implementation of
the patient-centered medical home, there are no
systematic data on the extent to which physi-
cians have or have not incorporated the model
into their practices. In 2008 we published na-
tional data on large primary care and multispeci-
alty medical groups with twenty or more physi-
cians and their use of "medical home processes"
that corresponded to four of the medical home
principles: physician-directed medical practice;
coordinated and integrated care; quality and
safety; and enhanced access. Examples of medi-
cal home processes included the use of electronic
medical records,use of nurse care managers,and
active engagement in quality improvement
activities.12
We found that the use of medical home
processes was low overall: The mean across
all organizations was 35 percent of possible
processes. Adoption was greatest for the largest
medical groups--those with more than 140
physicians--and for those owned by large enti-
ties such as hospitals that are most likely to have
greater resources.
However, most US physicians do not practice
in large medical groups. In fact, 35.1 percent of
visits to US office-based physicians are to solo
practitioners, and 88 percent are to practices
with nine or fewer physicians.13 Implementing
the principles of the patient-centered medical
home in these smaller practices may be particu-
larly challenging because there are fewer staff
and less resources to support implementation.14
Published studies on the adoption of medical
home processes in smaller practices are limited
to just two states, Virginia and Massachusetts. In
Virginia, most family medicine practices exhib-
ited some elements of the medical home model,
but few practices incorporated the full suite of
medical home characteristics.15 In Massachu-
setts, the prevalence of medical home capabil-
ities varied widely among 412 primary care prac-
tices, and increased adoption was associated
with large practice size and affiliation with a
larger network of practices.16
Study Data And Methods
The data for this article come from a large na-
tional survey, the National Study of Small and
Medium-Sized Physician Practices, which pro-
vides the first national data on the use of medical
home processes in practices that have 1­19 physi-
cians.We examined processes that correspond to
four joint principles of the patient-centered
medical home: physician-directed medical prac-
tice; care coordination and integration; quality
and safety; and enhanced access. These national
data do not include measures of the other three
fundamental principles--personal physician,
whole-person orientation, or payment reform--
but they do provide the most comprehensive
perspective on the adoption of medical home
processes to date.
In addition, building on our previous work
with large medical groups, we used multivariate
regression analysis to identify internal capabil-
ities and external incentives that are associated
with greater use of medical home processes in
these smaller practices.12,17,18 We expected that
greater use of medical home processes would
be associated with having more internal resourc-
es, such as a larger practice size or being owned
by a hospital, and more external performance
incentives, such as payments for higher-
quality care.
The National Study of Small and Medium-
Sized Physician Practices was a forty-minute
cross-sectional telephone survey conducted be-
tween July 2007 and March 2009 with the lead
physician or lead administrator of a national
sample of physician practices that had 1­19
physicians. Respondents were paid $175 for their
time.
Survey Sample No publicly available data-
base of US physician practices exists. We used
a comprehensive private database, the IMS
Healthcare Organization Services database,19

to create the population from which we sampled
practices. This national database includes
793,235 US physicians linked to the practices
in which they work. The database is updated
daily using a combination of primary and secon-
dary sources. IMS data are widely accepted and
have been used in dozens of studies published in
peer-reviewed journals.20,21
Practices were eligible for the survey if they
had 1­19 physicians of whom at least 60 percent
were some combination of adult primary care
providers (family physicians, general internists,
and general practitioners), cardiologists, endo-
crinologists, and pulmonologists. We included
only practices with these specialties because
the survey focused on care management proc-
esses for preventive care and for four major
chronic illnesses: asthma, congestive heart fail-
ure, diabetes, and depression. We included hos-
pital-owned practices but not academic faculty
practices.
The National Study of Small and Medium-
Sized Physician Practices was intended to pro-
vide data that would be as nationally rep-
resentative as possible and that would also be
useful for program evaluation purposes in each
of the fourteen sites (typically metropolitan
areas) involved in the Aligning Forces for Quality
initiative sponsored by the Robert Wood John-
son Foundation.22
Using the IMS database and the eligibility cri-
teria described above, we drew a random sample
of practices, stratifying by practice size (1­2, 3­
8, 9­12, and 13­19 physicians), each of the four
specialty types listed above, and location (each of
the fourteen Aligning Forces for Quality sites
and the remainder of the United States). We
oversampled the strata that had relatively few
practices, such as pulmonology practices with
13­19 physicians. We also oversampled within
each of the Aligning Forces for Quality sites,
to ensure an adequate sample for evaluation.
The number of practices that responded to the
survey was 1,745 (1,201 from the fourteen Align-
ing Forces for Quality communities and 544
from the national sample). The overall adjusted
response rate was 63.2 percent (64.3 percent for
the Aligning Forces for Quality communities and
61.3 percent for the national sample).23
For this article we restricted the analytic sam-
ple to a subset of 1,325 practices in which pri-
mary care physicians were at least 33 percent of
the physicians in the practice. We used a re-
stricted sample for two reasons. First, nearly
all policy and research attention to date has been
on primary care-based medical homes. Second,
data indicate that at this time very few specialty
practices provide "primary care" to a sizable per-
centage of their patients.24
Measurement Of Medical Home Processes
To measure physician-directed medical practice,
we asked about use of primary care teams, de-
fined in the survey as "a group of physicians and
other staff who meet with each other regularly to
discuss the care of a defined group of patients
and who share responsibility for their care."
To measure care coordination and integration,
quality and safety, and enhanced access, we used
multiple survey questions. Care coordination
and integration comprised five domains or sub-
categories, including the use of an electronic
medical record, electronic access to clinical in-
formation from specialists and hospitals, elec-
tronic prescribing, the use of chronic disease
registries, and the use of nurse care managers
for severely ill patients.
Quality and safety included questions span-
ning nine domains. Some domains emphasized
the use of clinical information technology,
others emphasized specially trained staff, while
others focused on the use of particular quality-
improvement strategies. Quality and safety proc-
ess measures encompassed a range of primary
care services including chronic care, clinical pre-
ventive services, and health promotion. We in-
cluded measures oriented toward both providers
and patients: guideline-based reminders at the
point of care and routine reminders for chronic
illness care, and the incorporation of patient
feedback.
Enhanced access encompassed two domains
including the use of group visits and the use of
e-mail for communication between physicians
and patients.
Each practice was assigned one point per do-
main if it passed a minimum threshold of 66 per-
cent for that domain. Consistent with our previ-
ously published research, we chose the
66 percent threshold in an effort to be rigorous
in our definition--that is, conservative in esti-
mating the extent of use of medical home
processes.
A summary medical home score was created
for each practice by adding the points across all
seventeen domains. A mean value for use of proc-
esses was also calculated for each of the four
practice-size categories. Practices with one to
two physicians were not asked about primary
care teams, so the possible medical home points
ranged from 0­16 for those practices, compared
to 0­17 for all other size categories. For compa-
rability across size categories, the final medical
home index for each practice was calculated as a
percentage of the total possible points for that
practice.
Practice Capabilities And External Incen-
tives Based on previous work and on a review of
the literature, we identified a number of factors

broadly defined as practice capabilities and ex-
ternal incentives that may be associated with the
use of medical home processes. Practice capabil-
ities included practice size, ownership, specialty
composition, and patient demographics. Each of
these capabilities may affect the amount of re-
sources available to a practice to invest in imple-
menting medical home processes.17,18 Four prac-
tice-size categories were created based on
number of physicians, with the expectation that
larger practices are more likely than smaller
practices to use medical home processes.15,16
Ownership by a larger entity has also been asso-
ciated with greater use of medical home proc-
esses.12,16 We created two ownership categories:
owned by physicians or owned by a larger entity
such as a hospital or a health maintenance
organization.
Because the medical home model requires co-
ordination between primary care and specialist
physicians, we included specialty composition of
the practice (multispecialty or primary care
only) as an independent variable. Finally, we
included two measures of patient demographics:
percentage of patients who are African American
and percentage of patients with limited English
proficiency, because practices caring for large
numbers of minority patients have reported
lower payment levels and increased challenges
delivering high-quality care.25­28
External incentives thought to increase use of
medical home processes by physician practices
included public reporting of practice data; pay-
for-performance; acceptance of some financial
risk for hospitalization costs incurred by the
practice's patients; payer mix (having fewer
Medicaid and uninsured patients); and care
management processes such as patient remind-
ers provided by health insurance plans.17,18,29­32 A
public reporting index (range: 0­2) was created
for each practice based on whether health plans
publicly report practice data on patient satisfac-
tion and clinical quality. A pay-for-performance
index (range: 0­3) was created based on whether
the practice had the opportunity to receive addi-
tional income from external entities based on
clinical quality scores, use of information tech-
nology, and the efficient use of resources.
To measure payer mix, we included the per-
centage of annual revenues for patient care from
Medicaid and low-income patients without in-
surance. Acceptance of financial risk for hospital
expenses was measured by multiplying the per-
centage of annual revenue from health mainte-
nance organizations (including point-of-service,
Medicaid managed care, and Medicare managed
care) by the percentage of patients for whom the
practice accepted some financial risk for hospi-
tal costs.
In our previous study of large medical groups,
use of care management processes for chronic
illness was associated with use of similar proc-
esses by health plans, which suggests that these
efforts complement, rather than substitute for,
one another.20 In this study we asked partici-
pants whether the major health plans that in-
sured their patients provided their practice with
any of the following care management tools and
resources for chronic illness: a list of patients,
performance data, patient reminders, patient ed-
ucators, and care managers. A single "health
plan activities index" was created for each prac-
tice (one point for each process used by health
plans; range: 0­5).
Analysis We first examined the prevalence of
each medical home process for the entire sample
and calculated the mean value for the medical
home index, adding the points across all seven-
teen categories.33,34 We then conducted bivariate
analyses by practice size, using chi-square tests.
The relationship between the overall medical
home index and practice capabilities and exter-
nal incentives was then analyzed using linear
regression.35 All analyses were weighted to re-
flect the national population of practices pro-
vided by IMS Health, adjusted for clustering in
the survey sample and the probability of selec-
tion and nonresponse.
Limitations Our unique national data set al-
lowed for measurement of processes that corre-
spond to four of the seven medical home princi-
ples. Our list of variables was extensive but not
exhaustive. For example, our measures of en-
hanced access did not include after-hours or
weekend accessibility, use of advanced access
principles, or electronic visits.
In addition, three joint principles were not
covered by our data: personal physician, whole-
person orientation, and payment reform. The
personal physician principle emphasizes the im-
portance of continuous healing relationships.
This is a fundamental aspect of the medical home
model, and the quality of these relationships
could differ by practice size. It is possible, for
On average, practices
earned 21.7 percent of
the possible points for
use of medical home
processes.

example, that continuity is better in smaller
practices, although there is little evidence on this
subject.36
We did not provide measures of whole-person
orientation, although we limited our analyses to
practices with a strong primary care focus. The
final joint principle, payment reform, addresses
issues largely beyond the control of the individ-
ual practice. We did include payment incentives
as independent variables in our regression
models.
Our study had other limitations. First, the ad-
justed response rate for our national survey was
63.2 percent. There was no statistically signifi-
cant difference between respondents and non-
respondents according to practice size (the only
variable on which we could make comparisons).
A higher response rate would be desirable, but
this rate is comparable to that in recently pub-
lished physician surveys.
Second, the responses came from a single
knowledgeable person within each practice
and are self-reported. It is possible that the re-
sults would differ if more people within the prac-
tice had been queried or if use of the processes
were independently audited. Respondents may
have consciously or unconsciously overreported
their use of medical home processes, so our re-
sults shouldbeconsideredas theupperbound on
the extent of use.
Third, the cross-sectional study design allows
for inferences of association but not causation.
Fourth, the IMS database is very large, is con-
tinuously updated, and has no obvious bias. It
contains 793,235 physicians linked to their prac-
tices (the American Medical Association states
that there are 813,560 active physicians in the
United States).37 There is no "gold standard" cen-
sus of US practices to which the IMS Health data-
base can be compared. Our results should be
considered broadly representative of the United
States, but we cannot claim that they are pre-
cisely nationally representative.
Finally, despite including a relatively extensive
set of independent variables in our regression
model, the R2 of 0.17 suggests that some varia-
tion in the adoption of medical home processes
is explained by factors not measured in our
study, such as physician leadership.
Results
Use Of Medical Home Processes On average,
practices earned 21.7 percent of the possible
points for use of medical home processes
(Exhibit 1). Solo and two-physician practices
used significantly fewer processes, compared
to practices in larger size categories. These
smaller practices were also significantly less
likely to use processes facilitated by clinical in-
formation technology, such as use of electronic
medical records, electronic prescribing, chronic
illness registries, electronic records to collect
data for quality measures, and the use of clinical
decision support (Exhibits 2 and 3; see Appendix
Exhibits 1 and 2 for additional detail).38 They
were also significantly less likely to use the
rapid-cycle quality improvement strategy and
to participate in any quality improvement collab-
oratives.
However, solo and two-physician practices
were significantly more likely to report that they
incorporate feedback from patients and that
their physicians communicate with patients via
e-mail.
The prevalence of use of processes varied
widely by type of process, ranging from 73.3 per-
cent for having electronic access to emergency
department notes to 2.4 percent for use of de-
pression care managers (Appendix Exhibits 1
and 2).38 In general, the use of nurse care man-
agers was low. Although one-quarter of practices
used electronic medical records for progress
notes, only 9.5 percent regularly used electronic
chronic disease registries, and only 8.7 percent
reported that a majority of their physicians com-
municated with patients via e-mail (Exhibit 2).
Practice Capabilities And External Incen-
tives Most practices were small, comprised only
primary care physicians, and were owned by
physicians, although larger practices were more
likely to be multispecialty and to be owned by a
hospital or health maintenance organization
(Exhibit 4). The largest practices were more

likely to be subject to public reporting and pay-
for-performance initiatives.
Factors Associated With Use Of Processes
In multivariate analysis, practices likely to have
more resources--such as larger practices and
those owned by a hospital or health maintenance
organization--were significantly more likely to
use more medical home processes (Exhibit 5).
For example, when other variables were held
constant, practices with 13­19 physicians scored
8.86 percentage points higher on the medical
home index compared to practices with 1­2
physicians. This represents a substantial in-
crease over the mean medical home score of
21.7 percent. Practices owned by a hospital
or health maintenance organization scored
2.23 percentage points higher compared to prac-
tices owned by physicians or other entities.
Practices exposed to external incentives--such
as pay-for-performance; public reporting; and,
to a much lesser extent, the assignment of some
financial risk to the practice for the cost of its
patients' hospital care--were also significantly
more likely to use more medical home processes.
For example, when other variables were held
constant, practices that had the opportunity to
receive extra income based on clinical quality,
use of information technology, and measures of
efficiency scored 9.72 percentage points higher
on the medical home index compared to practic-
es that had none of these pay-for-performance
incentives.
Patient demographics, payer mix, and use of
chronic care management processes by health
plans were not statistically significantly associ-
ated with the use of medical home processes.
Discussion
These are the first national data on the use of
medical home processes by small to medium-size
physician practices. We found that practices do
use these processes, but to a relatively limited
extent.We also found that greater use of medical
home processes was independently associated
with measures of internal capabilities and also
external incentives.
Our findings that larger practices and those
owned by hospitals or health maintenance or-
ganizations use more medical home processes
are consistent with those of our previous na-
tional study of large medical groups (twenty or
more physicians)15 and with studies in Massa-
chusetts and Virginia.18,19 The external incentive
measures used in this study are not directly com-
parable to those in our previous studies of large

medical groups, but those studies also suggested
that external incentives for quality are associated
with the use of more medical home processes.18,39
Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find
that practices that care for higher proportions of
patients who are low-income, are African Ameri-
can, or have low English literacy use fewer medi-
cal home processes; this finding is consistent
with a recent study in Massachusetts.28
Policy Implications
The patient-centered medical home is a widely
endorsed model of health reform that requires
fundamental changes in physician practice, in-
cluding the adoption of new care processes. This
study provides the first national data on the use
of an important subset of medical home proc-
esses by small and medium-size physician prac-
tices--by far the most common size of practice in
the United States.
Although no list of medical home processes is
definitive, we measured a broad spectrum of rec-
ommended care processes targeting multiple as-
pects of the medical home model and found that
on average, one-fifth of these processes were in
use. Medical home advocates may view our find-
ings as a glass one-fifth full, or four-fifths empty.
The more optimistic will appreciate that these
smaller practices, typically situated in frag-
mented care systems across the United States,
have already implemented some components of
the patient-centered medical home. Others will
focus on the low mean level of adoption of the
medical home processes measured here, placed
in context of the complete practice transforma-
tion required to realize the full vision of the
patient-centered medical home. From this per-
spective, widespread implementation appears
daunting.
Either way, it appears that major changes will
be required if the patient-centered medical home
is to be widely adopted. One response to the
association between use of medical home proc-
esses and size and ownership is to envision con-
solidation of smaller practices into larger enti-
ties. There is some evidence that the percentage
of physicians working in larger practices and for
hospitals is increasing.40 Yet small "cottage in-
dustry" practices continue to play a major role in
US health care delivery. It is therefore incumbent
upon health care leaders to identify and test

potential strategies to accelerate reforms in
these settings.
One strategy is to facilitate implementation at
the practice level by providing, for example, as-
sistance with leadership development, health in-
formation technology, data collection and re-
porting, effective team-based care, and other
aspects of practice redesign.41 Assistance could
come from a variety of sources external to the
practice, including, for example, multipayer ini-
tiatives,42 federal extension centers,43,44 or
accountable care organizations--all of which
are outlined in the Affordable Care Act.45­48
Another potential strategy would be for small
practices to share resources, such as care man-
agers, through an independent physician asso-
ciation or with help from a health plan or
government payer, such as Medicaid.49
A third potential strategy would be to increase
external incentives to help motivate practice
redesign.We found that exposure to pay-for-per-
formance, public reporting of practice data, and
acceptance of financial risk for hospital care
were each independently associated with greater
use of medical home processes by small and
medium-size practices. There is widespread
agreement that payment reforms are integral
to the success of the patient-centered medical
home, but little is known about the best method
of payment or the optimal size of financial in-
centives.29,30 Multiple pilots and demonstrations
are under way to determine the role of market
incentives in driving practice change.
A final strategy focuses on preparing the next
generation of health care providers to practice
in new care models. Although transforming
existing practices is not easy, transforming the
traditions of health professional education
presents its own challenges. The American Asso-
ciation of Medical Colleges and numerous pro-
fessional societies are providing leadership in
this area.
The patient-centered medical home is her-
alded by a broad coalition of policy makers, pur-
chasers, payers, providers, and consumer
groups as one particularly important element
of reforming the US health care system.50 The
implementation of medical home processes by
physician practices will be essential to the suc-
cess of the model. Also essential is the role of
other stakeholders in overcoming the substan-
tial financial, political, and professional barriers
to delivering and receiving care that is easily
accessible, focused on the whole patient over
time, coordinated across the care continuum,
facilitated by information technology and organ-
ized careprocesses, and informedby population-
based data on health outcomes and health care
costs.
