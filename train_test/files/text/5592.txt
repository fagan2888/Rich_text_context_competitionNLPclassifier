Abstract
This study explores the recruitment and retention conditions influencing primary health care (PHC) human resources for health
(HRH) in Qatar and suggests strategies for their improvement. A qualitative design employing semistructured key informant
interviews with PHC stakeholders in Qatar was utilized. Key interviewees were originally recognized, and snowball sampling
was used to identify additional interviewees until reaching saturation point. Interview scripts were transcribed and then
analyzed thematically using the Nvivo software package. Thematic analysis precipitated a number of themes. Under recruitment,
the centrality of enhancing collaboration with academic institutions, enhancing extrinsic benefits, and strengthening human
resources recruitment and management practices. Dedicated support needs to be provided to expatriate HRH especially in
regard to housing services, children schooling, and streamlining administrative processes for relocation. Findings revealed that
job security, continuous professional development, objective performance appraisal systems, enhanced job transparency, and
remuneration are key retention concerns. The study provides a number of recommendations for the proper recruitment and
retention of HRH. Health planners and decision makers must take these recommendations into consideration to ensure the
presence of a competent and sustainable HRH in the PHC sector in the future.

Original Research
Introduction
For years, primary health care (PHC) has been recognized as
a key, cost-effective health care component for enhancing
public health through preventing the spread of infections and
attenuating noncommunicable diseases (NCD).1-4 Literature
reports multiple population health benefits for increased
availability of PHC services, including reduced child mortal-
ity rates; decreased low birth weight; decreased mortality
due to strokes, cancer, and heart illnesses; increased life
expectancy; and decreased predicted potential years of life
lost.2,5-7 From a health systems'perspective, PHC is regarded
as the optimal vehicle for delivering equitable health ser-
vices, ultimately resulting in improved health outcomes with
decreased health expenditure.6
Human resources for health (HRH) are a critical compo-
nent of any effective health care system.8 An indispensable
prerequisite to establishing a robust PHC system is the
recruitment and retention of an adequate number of well-
educated and qualified HRH. The need for effective PHC
delivery complemented by a sustainable and competent sup-
ply of HRH is more heavily pronounced in the Eastern
Mediterranean Region (EMR). In fact, the EMR ranked sec-
ond to last in HRH densities, despite the established associa-
tion between nurse and physician densities and better life
expectancy with reduced overall mortality rates.9
PHC Context in the State of Qatar
Supporting the growth of a sustainable PHC system along
with required human resources is of particular concern to the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.10,11 Qatar is one

GCC country that has expressed interest in and launched
various initiatives aimed at improving its PHC system's
capacity to enhance the health of the public and address
growing population health needs.12
In fulfillment of the above, "Amiri Decree No. 15" came
into effect on February 20, 2012, and bestowed the Primary
Health Care Corporation (PHCC) complete administrative
and financial autonomy to oversee public PHC in Qatar.13
PHCC runs 21 PHC centers with the majority located in
Doha, Qatar's capital (n = 13).13,14
To meet the growing health demands and achieve set
goals of having PHC as the principal mode of care, Qatari
authorities have acknowledged the need for diligent efforts
to ensure an adequate supply of qualified primary care HRH,
with particular attention to strengthening recruitment and
retention strategies.15
Objective and Significance
This study aims at soliciting the feedback of PHC stakehold-
ers on the current HRH recruitment and retention strategies
and the means to strengthening them to enhance HRH avail-
ability and tenure in the PHC sector. To the knowledge of the
authors, this study presents the first systematic examination
of the HRH recruitment and retention strategies in the ever
expanding and strategically important PHC sector in the
state of Qatar.
Methodology
Ethical Approval
The study obtained ethical approval from the Joint Institutional
Review Board (IRB) in Qatar (IRB Number 13-00066), the
PHCC's Research Committee (Reference No: PHCC/
RC/13/002, PHCC/RC/14/04/009), and the Social and
Behavioral Studies IRB committee at theAmerican University
of Beirut (Protocol Number FHS.MA.05).
Study Design
The study utilized a qualitative study design involving a
series of semistructured key informant interviews with PHC
stakeholders in the state of Qatar.
Study Tool
A semistructured interview schedule, consisting of 13 open-
ended questions, was used for interviewing stakeholders.
Questions aimed at collecting information on stakeholders'
perception of PHC in the country and the existing recruit-
ment and retention strategies. The interview schedule and
subsequent interviews encouraged stakeholders to express
additional thoughts and to recommend additional stakehold-
ers relevant to the study utilizing snowball sampling. The
original version of the interview schedule was developed in
English and later translated into Arabic by a professional
translator. Back-translation was carried out to ensure accu-
rate translation of questions.
Stakeholder Selection and Data Collection
Stakeholders included coordinators, managers, academi-
cians, researchers, primary care providers, health authorities,
and parastatal organizations. This diversity in stakeholders
offered a multifaceted description and understanding of
HRH recruitment and retention.
The authors sought the advice of experienced Qatar-
residing medical and public health experts, carried out an
online review of PHC providers and authorities, and a review
of the PHC context and players in Qatar to identify 5 key
stakeholders who were invited to participate in this study .
The initial 5 stakeholders included an academic institution
dean, a medical college lecturer and educational program
director, a semiprivate organization health center manager, a
medical residency program director, and a program coordina-
tor at a local health authority. Snowball sampling was utilized
to identify additional key informants. Interviewing continued
until the saturation point was reached. This was determined
when additional interviewed stakeholders were neither pro-
viding new information nor suggesting any new key infor-
mants. In total, the study involved 11 key informants.
Stakeholders were invited through a package delivered to
their offices containing an invitation letter and an informed
consent. Out of 18 invited stakeholders, 11 accepted to par-
ticipate in the interview. The reasons provided for nonpar-
ticipation were busy schedule and lack of authority to speak
to research entities.
The majority of stakeholders were incumbents of more
than 1 influential position, and in many cases at different
institutions in the country. Table 1 offers a summary of the
positions held by the interviewed stakeholders along with the
type of institution they are employed at (the total does not
equal to the total number of interviewees as reference is
being made to the position rather than individual). Note that
for confidentiality purposes, and due to the small size of the
country and small number of institutions, the type instead of
the name of the institution was included in Table 1. Only one
of the stakeholders interviewed was of Qatari origin. All
other stakeholders were expatriates of different nationalities
(Western and Middle Eastern) working in Qatar. Although
only 1 Qatari was included in the study, we believe the
study's findings are representative of the Qatari context,
because expatriates constitute the great majority of the Qatari
workforce and are the main working segments affected by
recruitment and retention strategies and initiatives.
Over the course of 2 to 3 weeks after initial contact, stake-
holders were followed up with 2 additional e-mails and a
phone call to confirm their reception of the invitation and
decision to participate. A favorable decision to participate
Alameddine et al 3
was followed by arranging a time and place that met the
stakeholder's preferences and ensured their privacy and con-
fidentiality. Interviews ranged between 30 and 60 minutes in
duration. Upon receiving consent, interviews were audio-
taped for a more detailed and accurate account and analysis
of information. When stakeholders did not consent to audio-
taping, interviews were conducted by 2 members of the
research team; one led the interview while the other was
engaged in meticulous note taking. All research members
were fluent in both Arabic and English to accommodate for
stakeholders' preferences. Questions were supplemented by
detailed probing, catered specifically to stakeholders with an
academic and nonacademic background or profession.
Data Analysis
Audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim with spe-
cial attention to accurately translating all Arabic phrases and/
or answers into English. All interviews underwent extensive
thematic analysis to identify the main themes generated by
the study, the corresponding recruitment and retention rec-
ommendations, and the parties that are targeted by these
recommendations.
The thematic analysis yielded a comprehensive, well-orga-
nized document of all responses, relevant quotes, and key rec-
ommendations. The document was further analyzed, and the
answers were categorized into key themes and associated sub-
themes (Table 2). Two members of the research team, who later
compared results, separately reviewed the final document and
shared professional opinions to focus responses into agreed-
upon themes, subthemes, and the findings associated with each.
Note that, unless otherwise stated, each direct quote is
attributed to one source/stakeholder.
Results
Thematic analysis unearthed 3 major themes: (1) perception
and role of PHC in health care delivery, (2) recruitment prac-
tices, and (3) retention schemes. Each of these themes was
associated with a number of subthemes relevant to the objec-
tives of the study (Table 2). Discussion of each themes and
subthemes is presented below.
Perception and Role of PHC in Health Care
Delivery
This theme sets the context of how PHC settings, personnel,
and patient care are regarded, approached, and provided in
Qatar. In regard to PHC definition, analysis revealed a vari-
ety of opinions as to what primary care is in the state of
Qatar. A number of stakeholders described PHC by level of
care and duration of treatment, as well as the extent of com-
munity involvement and participation. It was acknowledged
as care throughout the cycle of life. Using the words of one
of the interviewed stakeholders, PHC is defined as follows:
"PHC is care from birth to neonates to pediatrics to adolescent
to adults to senior and geriatrics . . . " and "effectively total care
for the patient from cradle to grave." (Family physician, medical
lecturer, and program director at a primary health center and
academic institution)
Other stakeholders defined PHC by the range of health care
professionals delivering health care services, with a particular

emphasis on family medicine (FM), internal medicine, obstet-
rics and gynecology (OBGYN), and pediatrics. In terms of
role of the provider, suggestions were made that qualified
nurses can attend to minor cases, which, aside from yielding
cost and time-savings, enhances equitable access to care.
Related to this subtheme was the definition of PHC care as the
system that has a "gatekeeper for health services" (department
head and lecturer at a secondary care institution and medical
college). This was deemed by most interviewees as a cost-
effective and time-efficient system for care delivery.
The third subtheme focused on boasting more compre-
hensive PHC services, for example, mental health services
and screening, rehabilitation care, and family planning ser-
vices. Shortcomings in the provision of such services were
attributed to physicians lacking the time needed to perform a
full screening and care procedures, as well as mental health
illnesses being a cultural taboo. Furthermore, more emphasis
on OBGYN preventive services was recommended. Such
shortcomings are delineated in the following statement:
The only service available is screening for cervical and breast
cancer. Other services for women . . . osteoporosis . . . obesity or
wellness and health promotion services are not there. (Lecturer
and coordinator at a health authority)
Greater efforts were also recommended to strengthen
health promotion activities targeting children, parents, and
students, as well as improved public acceptance of "taboo"
diseases such as autism. Overall, more action at the commu-
nity level was advised with PHC to encompass palliative and
long-term care for NCDs.
Recruitment Practices
Although strategic recruitment measures are currently
employed across PHC organizations in Qatar, many opportu-
nities to strengthen capacities for meeting growing HRH
demands were identified by interviewed stakeholders.
With respect to existing recruitment strategies, academic
stakeholders described curricular restructuring in nursing
and medical programs aiming at boosting future recruitment
in the PHC sector, for example, holding more clinical prac-
tices and core rotations in community settings for medical
and nursing students. Sponsorship of students by health care
organizations was also recognized as a key approach to
increasing the enrollment in specialties that would feed into
the PHC system of care. Other recruitment strategies men-
tioned by the stakeholders included a plethora of benefits to
attract professionals to the PHC sector, such as generous
salaries, tax-free employment, health and dental coverage,
and generous family benefits.
Present impediments. Interviewed stakeholders identified a
number of impediments undermining effective HRH
recruitment efforts. Such limitations were classified as
those that fall under the control of the PHC sector and those
that go beyond that control. With respect to the former, a
number of impediments were identified including having
no HRH recruitment strategy, inadequate recruitment skills,
poor job descriptions, poor recruitment practices, and inef-
fective outsourcing of human resources recruitment ser-
vices. Of particular concern for the stakeholders were the
bureaucratic strains that delay or hinder the recruitment
process. The quote below clearly highlights the magnitude
of this problem:
After I applied, I took almost a year and half to join . . . from the
beginning of submitting my CV until I got a final acceptance
and joined . . . (Health care manager and primary care provider
at a semiprivate organization)
However, certain limitations go beyond the control of
the PHC sector. These include market shortages in HRH,
specifically nurses and female physicians; strong competi-
tion for competent HRH within Qatar and among GCC
states; and lack of competent HRH that can speak Arabic.
Another issue that emerged relates to fresh graduates, spe-
cifically Qataris, seeking only managerial positions. The
following stakeholder's quote documents the intricacies of
such hindrances:
. . . Graduates want to directly go into director positions even
before gaining experience. (Chief officer at secondary care
institution)
Means to boost recruitment. Stakeholders proposed multiple
contextualized strategies to boost HRH recruitment (Table
3). A key recommendation entailed strengthening the degree
of coordination among academic institutions to better satisfy
market needs. This would entail Qatari universities and other
academic institutions to collaborate on planning and imple-
menting medical and health care education programs. Such
collaboration could help fine-tune the HRH supply to the
needs of the country (recommendation for recruitment) and
ensure the offering of proper continuous education programs
to in-service HRH (recommendation for retention). Further-
more, stakeholders suggested enhancing the sponsorship of
students in health and medical majors that could feed into the
PHC sector.
At the level of human resources departments, recommen-
dations focused on improving the capacity of human
resources departments both by recruiting additional officers
and by training existing ones on recruitment techniques.
One key suggested strategy to boost recruitment, specifi-
cally for expatriate HRH, included offering better support for
relocating HRH, such as ensuring appropriate accommoda-
tion and reserving places in educational institutions for chil-
dren. These recommendations emanate from the difficulties
experienced by some HRH regarding matters such as the one
described in the quote below:

Note. HRH = human resources for health; PHC = primary health care.
Expanded definition of certain recommendations:
aUnified definition: Adopt a universal theoretical and working definition for PHC that would help providers set specific roles and differentiate between primary and more advanced levels of care and assist patients to better understand
the level of care they need to seek based on the type and extent of their health issue.
bEnhanced role for HRH: Nurses may assume certain responsibilities currently under the delegation of physicians as one means to improve efficiency.
cExpanded services: Add services to PHC centers, such as initial mental health diagnosis and care services.
6 INQUIRY
When I first came to Qatar, I went around for schools and I said
I've got three children, they all just laughed at me and said "well
you'll never get places." And that's what happened. It took us 18
months to get all our kids into school. (Health care manager and
primary care provider at a semiprivate organization)
Retention Schemes
Interviewees shared experiences in regard to existing reten-
tion schemes and offered advice on how they could be
strengthened.
Current schemes.Stakeholders described existing retention
schemes including a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic
rewards. Intrinsic rewards suggested by stakeholders
included professional development and continuing medical
education (CME) opportunities, promotion and training, and
conference participation.
Despite the importance of intrinsic recognition strategies,
the majority of retention schemes identified fall under extrin-
sic rewards. The provision of housing, travel and transporta-
tion allowances, and bonuses are well-recognized and
prevalent HRH retention strategies.
Present challenges. Stakeholders elaborated on an assortment
of challenges that jeopardize employee retention in the PHC
sector. Such challenges include lack of clear job description,
heavy workloads, skyrocketing cost of living, and lack of a
standardized salary scale. Lack of job stability and subopti-
mal retention strategies were affecting turnover rates, with a
stakeholder commenting,
. . . People come and go and come and go. They don't settle
down, and . . . when they find a better offer they leave. (Program
director at secondary care institution)
In addition, the shortage of intrinsic rewards and the sub-
jectivity of some HRH performance management systems
pose additional strains on the length of HRH employment.
One stakeholder reflects on this by stating,
Intrinsic awards are available . . .yet are not supported by
adequate budget . . . and programs are not consistent across
centers. (Health care manager and primary care provider at
primary health care center)
Recommendations. Interviewed stakeholders offered an assort-
ment of suggestions and recommendations that may lead to
better employee retention (Table 3). Recommendations
included implementing a career ladder that allows for the rec-
ognition and growth of HRH based on their performance; pro-
viding childcare assistance, maternity and parental leave, and
retirement plans; and allowing for continuous professional
development through participation in national and interna-
tional conferences. The importance of professional develop-
ment for retention is highlighted in the following quote:
If you don't make an effort to make job professionally satisfying,
then you're definitely going to have some people say, "I've been
doing this for too long, it's same old thing, and it's just become
so routine . . . my heart is not in it" . . . . and then you lose people.
(Primary care provider, program director, and lecturer at primary
health care center and academic institution)
In terms of working conditions, flexible hours and work-
place gender equality, as well as improving job security and
stability, were highly recommended initiatives.
Furthermore, stakeholders recommended that the man-
agement of PHC institutions implement initiatives that would
identify current and future HRH needs, oversee activities of
CME committees, and conduct "exit interviews" to gather
feedback from leaving HRH.
Discussion
Qatar has recently established a profound commitment to
boosting the public health of its people through realizing "a
comprehensive world-class health care system" with a par-
ticular emphasis on PHC.12,16-18 Successful outcomes of this
initiative are already being realized with PHCC receiving
platinum-level accreditation from Accreditation Canada
International, among other manifestations.19 Local authori-
ties have identified PHC as the optimal solution and HRH as
the core component for improved PHC delivery.17 This study
highlighted several existing PHC recruitment and retention
practices and delineated additional strategic and operational
initiatives for a sustainable supply of HRH and continued
PHC performance development. Analyses of stakeholders'
responses revealed that Qatar's PHC sector currently lacks
satisfactory mental health, family planning, and overall
screening services. These concerns are well founded with
mental illnesses having a prevalence rate of 20% and
accounting for 3 out of the 5 factors leading to disability in
the country.20
The need for advanced PHC screening and services is fur-
ther marked as studies reveal that consanguineous marriages
constitute half of all marriages among Qataris. The preva-
lence of marriage between relatives adds to the country's
need for qualified HRH stationed at PHC centers to provide
premarital education on the health implications of marriage
between relatives. In addition, proper dietary and weight
monitoring care is available in only 5 of PHCC's health cen-
ters, while services assisting smokers to quit are provided in
a single center.15,17,21,22 Initiatives to address such shortcom-
ings are underway with ongoing efforts aiming to include
mental health as a regular PHC service. Yet, such a strategic
expansion of services needs to be well supported by an ade-
quate number of properly trained mental health HRH should
the 5-year national mental health strategy be successfully
unfolded.17
One interim solution to address the mental health needs of
PHC patients is to train currently employed physicians on
Alameddine et al 7
caring for mental health issues. Such a measure, while neces-
sary on the short run, is suboptimal taking into consideration
the limited role of practitioners in attending to mental health
cases and their already busy schedule that prevents them
from delivering proper screening services, including mental
health.23 While it is expected that excessive reliance on expa-
triate human resources will continue for the next few years,
it is essential to work on building local training capacity to
boost local supply of HRH and ensure that service providers
are culturally savvy.
Offering HRH employed in the PHC sector an assortment
of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards would enhance recruitment
and contribute to prolonged employee tenure.24 The central-
ity of these rewards is underscored in existing national strate-
gies; nonetheless, they need to be properly operationalized
by provider organizations, such as PHCC. Such a task is
daunting taking into consideration that, to satisfy national
health objectives, PHCC needs to add 1900 HRH by 2017. In
addition, PHCC reports that only 27% of its workforce is
Qatari.17 Therefore, it is imperative for any successful
recruitment and retention strategy to consider that the major-
ity of PHC providers are expatriates. Such strategies need to
devote attention to the needs and aspirations of expatriate
HRH, including offering support with housing, facilitating
children schooling requirements, and streamlining the
administrative processes so that the relocation and settlement
would be possible within a reasonable time frame.
One key reward that was expressed by virtually all public,
academic, and parastatal stakeholders was the availability
and fairness in the selection of candidates to participate in
CME and professional development activities. Access to
such opportunities is pivotal because they are a prerequisite
for job promotion and career advancement, as well as a
requirement to maintain licensure with professional colleges,
orders, and syndicates. The outcomes of CME activities may
also exceed the organizational level to influence community
health outcomes.25 PHCC, in its national PHC strategy, has
committed to continuously advancing and training its HRH.17
The current study has a number of shortcomings that are
worth mentioning. First, the interviewed stakeholders may
not be representative of all PHC employers in the state of
Qatar. Second, the research team could not ascertain whether
the identified interviewees who declined the request for
interview held views different from those who accepted to be
interviewed. Third, it cannot be confirmed whether the inter-
viewed stakeholders were biased in their responses in fear of
disclosure.
Conclusion
Multiple internal and external factors currently influence
Qatar's sustainable supply of PHC professionals.
Encouragingly enough, Qatar's PHC strategy recognizes and
commits to addressing the majority of the discussed HRH
concerns. The study provided guiding mechanisms to assist
PHC decision makers in translating knowledge by imple-
menting recruitment and retention strategies. PHC authori-
ties are advised to approach developments from a
consultative, bottom-up approach, with HRH feedback as the
initial and main input for improvement. Future investigations
would focus on evaluating the impact of implemented strate-
gies and identifying areas for improvement. Studies on spe-
cific determinants of HRH retention are also recommended
for more targeted efforts.
