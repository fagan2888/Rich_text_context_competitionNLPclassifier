Abstract
The objectives of this study were to assess the factors which contribute to individuals' health motivation to address hearing
loss and to gather baseline data that could then be used to measure the impact of an awareness campaign. An online
questionnaire with 13 closed set questions was completed by 100 subjects in each country including Austria, Germany,
France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The questionnaire was based around the Health Belief Model, which describes
how, in order to take action to address a medical problem, the individual must perceive that the condition presents a
threat to their well-being that exceeds any barriers to treatment. Good hearing was regarded as being important in all
countries. There was agreement that the main sign of hearing loss was turning up the TV or radio. In most countries,
hearing aids were thought to be not particularly visible, not require much maintenance, a hindrance while doing sport,
and must be removed before bed. Perceptions of hearing implants were that they were permanently fitted, not externally
visible, and do not need to be removed before bed. Medical issues were mostly researched through a doctor and then via
the Internet. In this sample, there was a good understanding of the consequences and signs of hearing loss, but although
hearing implants were viewed as being different to hearing aids, there was little understanding that the external speech
processor was similar to a hearing aid in its physical characteristics. When actions were taken, the key professionals consulted
about hearing problems were the general practitioner and ear, nose, and throat specialist.

Original Research
Introduction
In the developed world, cochlear implantation has become a
standard treatment option for adults and children with bilat-
eral severe to profound hearing loss when powerful hearing
aids no longer provide sufficient benefit. Estimates for the
prevalence of hearing loss in the United States indicate that
3.4% of the total hearing impaired population have a severe
or profound hearing loss (>70 dB HL). In the United
Kingdom, this percentage was estimated as higher, with
6.7% of the clinical population having a bilateral pure tone
average hearing loss greater than 70 dB HL.1,2 Taking
population figures from 2013 and applying these prevalence
figures, based on hearing loss, gives an estimate of 2 million
children and adults who could potentially benefit from
implantation in the these countries3 alone. However, as of
December 2012, only approximately 324,200 people world-
wide had received a cochlear implant (CI).4 A proportion of
this discrepancy may be due to differences between the defi-
nition of severe to profound hearing loss in the prevalence
studies and the specific CI criteria applied by the clinics, but
this still represents a fraction of those who could benefit
from this technology. This has led researches to look more
closely at the penetration rates for this treatment.
Utilization rates for CI, in both adults and children with
severe to profound loss, were reported in Sorkin and
Buchman5 for Germany, Austria, Sweden, United Kingdom,
Australia, and the United States. These were based on the
known implanted population and prevalence data collected
in the respective countries. Pediatric utilization rates ranged

from 97% in Australia to 50% in the United States and were
considerably higher than adult utilization in all regions.
Adult penetration was less than 10%, regardless of geo-
graphic region. This is surprising given that utilization rates
for adult hearing aid use in people with a severe or profound
hearing loss are high, at 70% to 90% and leads us to question
why the uptake of CI in the adult population is so poor.6
Lack of funding has the potential to restrict the number of
suitable adults who are implanted. However, CIs have been
shown to be highly cost-effective, with low complication
rates, and in most developed economies, funding is provided
by national health programs, employer-based insurance, or
private insurance schemes.7,8 A contributing factor to the low
numbers of adults receiving implants is the low numbers of
suitable candidates presenting for assessment. We know that
some adults decide against being referred for or having a CI,
even after being assessed as a suitable candidate, due to con-
cerns around surgery, worries about losing residual hearing,
rehabilitation requirements, and the hope that another tech-
nology will come onto the market. Poor referral rates may
also be due to poor awareness and knowledge of the treat-
ment among professionals and patients, or even a negative
perception of implants in the general population, due to the
political issues around the impact implantation has on deaf
culture and the deaf community.6 Adults over the age of 65
years have a greater prevalence of hearing loss but an even
lower utilization rate for CI than younger adults with acquired
loss9; for example, in Australia utilization in this group is
0.3%.5 The perception of hearing loss as a natural conse-
quence of the aging process, by both patient and profes-
sional, acts as an additional barrier to treatment for this
group, and people who regarded hearing loss as being incon-
sequential and accept it passively are less likely to seek
treatment.10
Theories of learning use models to explain and modify
behavior patterns. The Health Belief model provides a frame-
work to describe how people can be influenced to change
their health-related behavior.11 The model states that 3 condi-
tions are required to change behavior: (1) the existence of
sufficient motivation (or health concern) to make health
issues salient or relevant; (2) the belief that one is susceptible
or vulnerable to a serious health problem or to the sequelae
of that illness or condition (often termed "perceived threat");
and (3) the belief that following a particular health recom-
mendation, at a subjectively acceptable cost, would be ben-
eficial to reducing the perceived threat. Cost refers to the
perceived barriers that must be overcome to follow the health
recommendation; it includes, but is not restricted to, finan-
cial outlays. When this is translated into the area of hearing
loss, we can state that people will take action to seek treat-
ment for hearing loss if they view hearing loss as a serious
problem, they feel sufficiently concerned about the severity
of their hearing loss, and that there are more benefits than
barriers to amplification.12
One way of improving the awareness of hearing loss in
the general population, its impact and the treatments avail-
able, is to put in place an education campaign. The purpose
of any campaign would be to improve individuals' motiva-
tion to take action and seek treatment. The aim of this study
was to assess the factors that contribute to individuals'health
motivation to take action and address their hearing loss. The
older adult population was targeted as the prevalence of
hearing loss is higher in this group. The objective was to
gather baseline data, in a range of countries, which would
then be used to measure the impact of any future interven-
tions put in place to improve awareness.
Method
An online questionnaire, designed by the authors, to assess
subjects'current health motivation to seek treatment for their
hearing loss was provided by a professional market research
company (Karmasin Motivforschung, Vienna, Austria).
Subjects were asked to complete the online questionnaire at
home. Data were collected from Austria, Germany, France,
Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
The questions were based around the Health Belief model,
as shown in Figure 1 and looked at subject's perceived sus-
ceptibility to hearing loss, its severity (the perceived threat
that hearing loss presents), and the barriers to action. Fifteen
closed set questions were presented to assess subject's per-
ceptions in 3 areas: (1) their susceptibility to hearing loss, its
importance to them and its impact (the threat); (2) the barri-
ers that may prevent them from seeking treatment; (3) the
actions that subjects currently take to address any hearing
concerns.
Potential barriers to treatment were selected based on the
personal experience of the authors, gained from focus groups
and talking to existing CI users and CI clinicians. These were
identified as being the visibility of the device or cosmetics,
convenience of use for all situations, including sports or
going to bed, and management of the device. Questions were
designed to assess the perception of both implants and hear-
ing aids, as a hearing aid is the alternative treatment option.
Respondents were also asked if they thought there was any
difference between a hearing aid and a hearing implant and
in hearing sensitivity between hearing aids and implants.
This was to assess if lack of perceived benefit or differences
between implants compared with hearing aids was acting as
a barrier to implantation.
The questionnaire was translated from English into the
required languages both forward and backward, to check for
any translation errors. A pilot study was conducted to ensure
the clarity of the questions, with a group of normally hearing
subjects; any questions which were felt to be unclear or
ambiguous were reworded or deleted. The full questionnaire
is provided in the appendix. The questions are grouped
according to their relevance to the Heath Belief model.

Subjects
Subjects were recruited from a sample of individuals who
were held on the database belonging to the Karmasin
Motivforschung market research company and received no
reward for taking part. The subjects held on the database had
given their informed consent to the company for their data
to be used anonymously in studies and publications relating
to any questionnaires completed. A subset of individuals
were selected from the database to participate in this study
to provide a broad sample, representative of the general
population of adults in each country. Factors taken into con-
sideration were age and geographic region. Subjects were
recruited in 2 age brackets: 50-60 years and 61-70 years.
The proportions of subjects in each group, by country, are
given in Table 1. There was an equal split between men and
women. Subjects were recruited during a period from June
1, 2013, to July 31, 2013, and recruitment continued in each
country until 100 fully completed questionnaires were col-
lected. Incomplete questionnaires were discarded. The
exclusion criteria were having no access to the Internet and
not being able to complete the questionnaire online.
No ethics approval was required for the study, which was
conducted according to the principles laid out in the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Statistics
As the purpose of the study was provide baseline data, only
descriptive statistics are provided for the percentage of
respondents selecting each option for the closet set ques-
tions. Where a Likert rating scale has been used, mean values
and ranges are given, but statistical comparisons are not
made between values.
Results
The first 100 fully completed questionnaires for each coun-
try were included.
Perceived Susceptibility to Hearing Loss and Its
Impact or Threat Perception
These questions sought to establish how relevant informa-
tion about hearing implants and hearing loss was to the sub-
jects, as well as the impact of hearing loss.
Question 3.In 4 out of 5 countries, over 40% of respondents
thought that hearing implants benefited all age groups equally
(Table 2).
Question 4. Hearing loss was most commonly viewed as the
reduction in the ability to hear in all countries. Percentages of
respondents ticking this box ranged from 80% in the United
Kingdom to 43% in Sweden. In Germany and Austria, only
60% and 63% of people selected this box, but 28% and 37%
of people, respectively, also selected "hearing loss is the
complete loss of the ability to hear." Between 33% and 18%
of people thought hearing loss could be halted (Table 3).

Question 5.The majority of subjects (range, 85%-59%)
viewed the terms hearing loss and hearing impairment as
being different from each other. The next most common
answer was "don't know" and over 80% of respondents
ticked either one or other of these boxes.
Question 10.All countries listed having the volume of TVs
and radios turned up very high as the main sign of possible
hearing loss. Percentages ranged from 80% of subjects
selecting this option in the United Kingdom to 51% in Swe-
den. The top 4 other indicators in all regions were difficulties
hearing high-pitched sounds, problems and difficulties in
using a telephone, an inability to locate background sounds,
and constant ringing or buzzing in the ears. A much lower
percentage of people selected problems using the telephone
in Sweden and France than in other countries (30% and 29%
vs 50%-62%).
Question 12.The top 4 consequences of hearing loss were
restricted communication (when face-to-face and when using
the telephone), impaired quality of life, social isolation, and
frustration. Four countries listed restricted communication as
the top consequence, with percentages ranging from 95% to
73%.
Question 13. When asked "How important is it for you per-
sonally to have a good sense of hearing, to be able to hear
well?" the mean rating and mode on a Likert scale was 1 for
all countries, where 1 represents "completely agree" and 5
"do not agree at all" (Table 4).
Actions Taken
Question 6. Across all countries, people primarily found out
about medical issues from their doctor, followed by the
Internet. Percentages ranged from 71% to 80% for the doctor
and 56% to 77% for the Internet. Less than 10% of people
did not inform themselves about medical issues at all.
Question 7. Again, the medical doctor and the Internet were
the most common sources of information for finding out
about hearing impairment. Percentages were generally lower
than for general health issues, but similar across countries,
and ranged from 50% to 65% for the doctor to 33% to51%
for the Internet (France and the United Kingdom). In Ger-
many, France and Austria a high percentage of respondents
(26%, 31%, and 23%) did not inform themselves at all about
hearing impairment.
Question 8.The general practitioner (GP) and dentist were
the most common doctors to visit just as a precaution, and
percentages were similar across countries, ranging from 68%
to 54% for the dentist and 47% to 68% for the GP, with
France being the lowest figure. A low percentage of people
visited the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist with
percentages ranging from 9% to 10% in Sweden and the
United Kingdom to 21% to 28% for Germany France and
Austria.
Question 9.When those who had indicated in the previous
question that they do not visit an ENT specialist as a precau-
tion were asked why not, the reasons indicated were either
never had problems in that area (37%-43%) or, for 4 coun-
tries, never thought to do so (32%-39%). The exception was
France, where the second reason indicated was "I do not
think it's necessary" (34%) and "never thought of doing so"
was the fifth reason given (15%).
Question 11.If suffering from a hearing loss over 96% of
people living in Germany would visit an ENT specialist and
40% of them would visit a hearing aid acoustician. The fig-
ures are similar in Austria at 91% and 38%, respectively.
France and Sweden would visit the ENT specialist (82% and
63%) followed by the GP (31% and 46%) and third a hearing
aid acoustician (26% and 36%). The United Kingdom fol-
lowed a very different pattern with the GP being the first
medical specialist to consult (83%), an ENT specialist sec-
ond (45%), and the hearing aid acoustician fourth at 20%.
Barriers to Treatment
Question 2. When asked if there was a difference between a
hearing aid and a hearing implant, the majority answered
"yes" (72% UK to 40% France) or "don't know" (24% UK
to 56% France).
The other barriers were addressed with 1 question where
respondents were required to rate each statement (shown in
Table 5) on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 represents
"completely agree" and 5 "do not agree at all." Ratings of 1
and 2 are grouped as "agree" and 4 and 5, "disagree."
The lowest Likert ratings and therefore highest agreement
ratings for Sweden, Germany, Austria, and the United
Kingdom were for "hearing implants are permanently fitted
and do not need to be removed before bed," "hearing implants
are not externally visible," and "hearing aids must be
removed before bed at night." Weaker agree ratings were
given for "hearing implants require regular maintenance"
and "hearing aids can be a hindrance when doing sport."
The strongest disagree ratings for these 4 countries were
given for "qualitatively there is no difference between hear-
ing aids and hearing implants" and "hearing implants can be
a nuisance during physical activity" followed by "hearing
aids require a great deal of maintenance" and "it is usually
possible to immediately identify people wearing hearing
aids."
France has a slightly different pattern of responses; strong
agreement ratings are given for "hearing aids must be
removed before bed" but also "hearing implants require reg-
ular maintenance and adjustments." Agreement ratings are
also given for "hearing implants can be a nuisance during
D'Haese et al 5
physical activity." A strong disagreement rating is given for
"hearing implants are permanently fitted and do not need to
be removed before bed" as well as "qualitatively there is no
difference between hearing aids" and "it is usually possible
to immediately identify people wearing hearing aids."
Discussion
The results of the survey provide an insight into the current
opinions on hearing loss of the older adult population. The
Health Belief model was used as a framework to interpret the
data, and the questions were divided into categories to
address the 3 key areas. The model describes how, to take
action to address a medical problem, the individual must per-
ceive that the condition presents a sufficient threat to their
well-being that exceeds any barriers. If utilization of CIs is to
increase, awareness of the impact of hearing loss and the
treatments available must be improved. To reduce the barri-
ers to cochlear implantation as an effective treatment, knowl-
edge of its benefits and limitations must also be improved
and any misconceptions corrected. The data gathered in this
survey enabled the authors to assess how individuals per-
ceived their susceptibility to hearing loss, its impact on their
lives, and some of the barriers which might be preventing
them from seeking a CI as a treatment. It also showed what
actions people were taking once they had decided to seek
help and provided a baseline to measure the impact of a
planned awareness campaign.
When looking at the perceived threat, as expected, good
hearing was regarded as being important in all countries.
However, the wording of this question lead respondents
toward a positive response and a more open format might
have produced different results. Hearing loss was viewed as
either a reduction in the ability to hear or, to a lesser extent,
the total loss of all hearing. This ambiguity in the definition
of hearing loss was highlighted when subjects were asked if
there was a difference in the terms hearing loss and hearing
impairment; most answered either "yes" or "don't know."
The World Health Organization uses the term hearing loss to
cover all levels of hearing impairment and the terms are used
interchangeably by many professionals across all the coun-
tries surveyed. On reflection, this question was confusing for
many respondents, reflected in the high number of don't
knows and should have been removed after the pilot stage.
When asked which age groups would benefit most from a
hearing implant, most respondents identified all groups
equally. In Sweden, more respondents selected the under 20s
compared with the other countries, but over 50% still selected
"all groups equally." However, in France the pattern was dif-
ferent. The older age groups were selected as being the most
likely to benefit, with low percentages for the under 20s and
"all groups equally." It is not know why the data were so dif-
ferent in this country. The age categories were set to keep
consistency across countries; however, if different age cate-
gory boundaries were chosen or the age bands given names,
then the results could have been different. Prevalence data
have shown that hearing loss increases with age, but the pro-
vision of implants in the over 65s is lower than in younger
people, despite there being no clinical barriers to older adults
receiving a CI.5,9,13-15 It was encouraging that in general,
respondents identified that older adults could benefit from an
implant. However, the lack of access in this group to appro-
priate treatment is concerning, particularly as recent studies
have highlighted the relationship between untreated hearing
loss, general health, and dementia.16,17
There was agreement across all countries that the main
sign of hearing loss was turning the TV or radio up high and
the next 4 most frequent responses were also common to all

countries (difficulties hearing high-pitched sounds, problems
and difficulties using a telephone, an inability to locate back-
ground sounds, and constant ringing or buzzing in the ears).
There was also a good understanding across all countries of
the consequences of hearing loss, although the exact order of
the responses varied slightly.
When addressing the barriers to treatment, the questions
focused on the visibility of the device, the convenience of
use for all situations, specifically sports or going to bed, and
general management of the device. As not all barriers to
treatment were explored, the conclusions relating to this area
of the survey can only be drawn based on the questions
asked. Barriers such as fear of surgery, losing residual hear-
ing, and identity considerations were not considered as they
were not identified by the focus groups as key areas of con-
cern at the time. Since the study was conducted, there is more
awareness among professionals of some of these barriers to
implantation, and if the study were to be repeated, they
should be included.
In general, subjects knew that there was a difference between
hearing aids and hearing implants (72% to 40%) and when
asked if there was no qualitative difference (in terms of hearing
sensitivity) between them, median scores tended toward dis-
agree, indicating that a difference is perceived. However, we do
not know if the respondents understood what the differences
were. For the questions about hearing aids, there was general
agreement across countries that hearing aids are not seen as
being particularly visible and can be a hindrance while doing
sport and must be removed before bed. They were also thought
not to require much maintenance, except in France where a
slightly higher agreement rating was given for this statement.
Perceptions of implants were the opposite. Four out of 5 coun-
tries thought implants do not have to be removed before bed, are
not externally visible, need little maintenance, and are not a hin-
drance for physical activities. Only in France were implants cor-
rectly viewed as externally visible, needing to be removed
before bed, a hindrance for physical activities, and requiring
regular maintenance and adjustment. Interpretation of these
results is complicated using the word "implant" when referring
to a CI. The implanted part of the device cannot be removed and
is not visible. However, to work the implanted device must be
connected to an externally worn microphone and speech proces-
sor resembling a hearing aid, which can be removed. Although
the respondents may not know what a cochlear implant is, an
implant of any kind is not normally removed and only someone
knowledgeable about CIs would know that the external speech
processor can be removed. If some respondents in the sample
were aware of this distinction, they might still have answered,
correctly, that the implant cannot be removed. When initial dis-
cussions about hearing implants are taking place, the realization
by patients that the external parts of a hearing implant are not
very different practically from a hearing aid and retain the same
perceived stigma may deter patients from even agreeing to be
referred for an assessment.
Medical issues were mostly researched through a doctor
and then via the Internet, including those relating to hearing.
This would support the use of an Internet-based awareness
campaign, although, because it was an Internet based survey,
the sample selected was clearly already comfortable with
Internet use. Internet use among older adults is known to
decline over the age of 75 years; nevertheless, survey data
have shown that around 70% of people in their early 70s go
online.18 In Germany, France, and Austria, a high percentage
of respondents (26%, 31%, and 23%) did not inform them-
selves at all about hearing impairment.
The current precautionary health actions taken were most
commonly visits to the GP. Not many subjects said they
would visit an ENT specialist as a precautionary measure,
with the reasons given as never having had problems in this
area or never thought to do so.
When asked who they would visit if suffering from a hearing
loss, patterns of behavior were dictated by country specific
guidelines. In the United Kingdom, for example, the National
Health Service Web site advises people to visit the GP as the
first person to consult for hearing issues and it is mandatory to
consult a GP before going to see an ENT specialist.19 In
Germany and Austria, over 90% of people would visit an ENT
specialist and then a hearing aid acoustician. In France and
Sweden, people would first visit the ENT specialist followed by
the GPand third a hearing aid acoustician. In research looking at
hearing aid uptake in the moderate to severely hearing impaired
group, the GP's management of age-related hearing impairment
was found to be a barrier to seeking help for hearing impair-
ment, and this would be a factor against initially consulting a
GP.12 In practice, those people within the audiometric criteria
for implantation are likely to be fitted with a hearing aid and

already under the care of an audiologist or hearing aid acousti-
cian, who are often best placed to make an appropriate referral
to a CI program. It was decided not to distinguish between audi-
ologists and hearing aid acousticians in the survey. Hearing aid
acousticians are present in all countries included in the study
and are more numerous than audiologists. Training for audiol-
ogy varies widely in level and availability in the different coun-
tries. There are hardly any audiology training programs in
Austria and France and a few in Germany and Sweden; thus,
access to audiologists in these regions is limited, and hearing aid
acousticians are the most likely professionals to be consulted.
The authors have made every attempt to control for bias in
the study results. However, bias may still be present in the study
sample selected. The subjects who completed the questionnaire
were clearly technically competent enough to fill out a question-
naire online and were sufficiently interested in the topic to take
part in the survey. There was no information provided on
whether subjects had an existing hearing loss or wore a hearing
aid, and this may have had a large impact on the levels of knowl-
edge of the sample. There was also no data gathered on the edu-
cation levels or socioeconomic group of the participants. The
questions asked were closed set and did not provide an opportu-
nity for comment; this may be particularly relevant for the bar-
riers to treatment suggested.
Future research will focus on the use of online, media based
advertising campaigns designed to raise awareness. The use of
the Internet as a source of medical information is becoming
commonplace, and the results of this survey support this find-
ing, even in the older age groups. The advertising will direct
users via a click through, to a Web site providing comprehen-
sive information on implantable hearing devices. From this
point, the individual is free to access as much or as little infor-
mation as they choose. The media outlets chosen will cover
both mainstream media and publications aimed at health care
professionals and related to hearing. There is currently more
awareness within the CI community that more training need to
be provided to hearing professionals and that hearing aids
users need to be made aware that a CI may be a suitable treat-
ment for them. This has resulted in some regional awareness
activities and other media campaigns funded by implant man-
ufacturers. The intention of this activity is to increase aware-
ness of cochlear implantation, and thus, it will be difficult to
establish the impact of this individual campaign on behavior.
However, all of these activities are welcome and necessary as
without action to improve awareness of this treatment, many
individuals who could have benefited from a CI will not
receive one.
Conclusions
In this sample of 50 to 70 years old, taken from multiple
countries, hearing loss was perceived as a problem. There
was a good understanding of the consequences and signs of
hearing loss, but knowledge was limited. Cochlear implants
were viewed as being different to hearing aids, but not
always in the correct way, and there was little understand-
ing that the external speech processor was similar to a hear-
ing aid in its physical characteristics. Medical issues,
including those relating to hearing, were mostly researched
through a doctor and then via the Internet. It was encourag-
ing that when motivated to do so, people sought informa-
tion from medical professionals, mostly GPs and ENT
specialists, about their hearing problems. The data collected
in this first phase of the awareness campaign will be used as
a baseline to measure changes in the data, using the same
sample population and questionnaire, following an Internet
awareness campaign aimed at referring ENT clinicians and
older adults.

It is usually possible to immediately identify people wearing
hearing aids
3.6 (22) 3.0 (34) 3.4 (23) 3.3 (28) 3.4 (20)
Hearing implants are not externally visible 2.2 (49) 2.5 (38) 3.0 (29) 2.0 (65) 2.1 (53)
Hearing aids must be removed when the wearer goes to bed,
for example
2.3 (35) 2.2 (47) 1.7 (46) 1.9 (53) 2.3 (43)
Hearing implants are permanently fitted and so do not need to
be removed before going to bed at night
2.1 (40) 2.4 (39) 3.6 (14) 2.1 (45) 1.9 (51)
Hearing aids can be a hindrance when doing sports (they slip,
got lost, etc.)
2.8 (33) 2.5 (39) 2.7 (35) 2.8 (31) 2.7 (32)
Hearing implants can be a nuisance during physical activity 3.8 (7) 3.5 (10) 2.8 (32) 3.9 (6) 3.4 (6)
Hearing aids require a great deal of maintenance 3.3 (14) 3.4 (14) 2.8 (28) 3.2 (20) 3.0 (19)
Hearing implants require regular maintenance and adjustment 2.6 (36) 2.9 (11) 1.8 (55) 2.4 (36) 2.8 (15)
Qualitatively (in terms of hearing sensitivity) there is no
difference between hearing aids and hearing implants
3.5 (12) 3.7 (4) 3.8 (5) 3.6 (13) 3.5 (4)
Note. 1 = agree completely, 5 = do not agree at all. The mean rating is given, with the percent of time this answer was given a score of "1" or "2"
