In 2007, we published a paper in the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology describing PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB serum
concentration data collected for the 2001­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Since publication of this paper, several of the 1998
World Health Organization Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs), which were used to calculate the summary statistics we presented, have been changed. In
this addendum, we publish new reference statistics using the WHO2006
TEFs in addition to assessing the effect of these new TEFs on total TEQ
concentrations for the general US population. We also examined the effect of the limits of detection (LODs) on the calculated TEQ summary statistics for
the top seven contributing congeners and completed a missing data analysis to determine whether our estimates were biased by excluding individuals
without complete congener profiles. Similar to our previous results, 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD; 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-PeCDD; 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8-HxCDD; 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-PeCDF;
and PCB 126 contributed the most to total TEQ. However, both PCB 156 and 157 were no longer significant contributors, instead being displaced by 1,
2, 3, 4, 7, 8-HxCDF, and PCB 169. In general, the decrease in TEFs for the mono-ortho-substituted PCBs decreased their contribution to total TEQ
appreciably, causing TEQ17-9
to approximately equal TEQ17-3
. The effect of LODs for five of the top seven contributing congeners was negligible;
however, the LODs for 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD and 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-PeCDD were noticeably higher and may impact TEQ estimates primarily for individuals aged
20­29 years. Results from the missing data analysis provide compelling evidence that the summary statistics we reported previously, as well as those
described here, were not greatly influenced due to censoring data.

Introduction
The availability of serum concentration reference values has
become essential as biomonitoring data are being used more
often to determine if individuals have been exposed to specific
chemicals (NRC, 2006; Paustenbach and Galbraith, 2006a, b).
In our original paper (Ferriby et al., 2007), we described serum
reference concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins
(PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and diox-
in-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) for the general US
population using the 1998 World Health Organization (WHO)
Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs) and dioxin-like serum
concentration data from the 2001­2002 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). TEFs, initially
developed in the mid-1980s to facilitate the evaluation of
potential health risks associated with exposure to complex
mixtures of PCDD/Fs and PCBs, have been revised multiple
times over the past 20 years based on advances in the state of
the science (Haws et al., 2006). Prior to publication of our
original report, a WHO International Programme on Chemical
Safety (IPCS) expert panel was convened to re-evaluate the
contemporaneous TEFs. In July 2006, Van den Berg et al.
published revised TEFs for 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-pentachlorodibenzo-
furan; 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-pentachlorodibenzofuran; octachlorodiben-
zo-p-dioxin; octachlorodibenzofuran; and PCBs 81 and 169,
along with all mono-ortho substituted PCBs.
In accordance with these changes, we reanalyzed the 2001­
2002 NHANES serum concentration data for PCDDs,
PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs, and, using the revised
WHO2006
TEFs, calculated reference statistics for the general
population. In this addendum, we present the updated
summary statistics for several demographic subgroups,
along with an assessment of the contribution of individual

congeners to the total TEQ. For completeness, we evaluated
the effect the revised TEFs had on total TEQ serum
concentrations, in addition to the effect of the limits of
detection (LODs) on the calculated TEQ summary statistics
for the top seven congeners. Additionally, we conducted a
missing-data analysis to assess whether excluding individuals
without complete congener data impacted our estimates.
Methods
Data Source
Data collection and laboratory analytical techniques have
been described formerly (NCHS, 2005a; Ferriby et al.,
2007). Further details regarding the NHANES procedures,
survey components, questionnaires, and examination are
available at the CDC National Center for Health Statistics
website, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm. Serum con-
centrations of all 2, 3, 7, 8-substituted PCDD/Fs, as well as
PCBs 81, 105, 118, 126, 156, 157, 167, 169, and 189, were
quantified in this study. Analytes were measured using
high-resolution gas chromatography and/or isotope-dilution
high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGS/ID-HRMS) as
described in the Third National Report on Human Exposure
to Environmental Chemicals (NCHS, 2005b). All samples
with concentrations below the LOD were assumed to have a
concentration equivalent to the proxy value assigned by the
CDC, which is equal to the sample-specific LOD divided by
the square root of 2 (CND
¼LOD/O2).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis methods used in this study have
been described previously by Ferriby et al. (2007). Briefly,
lipid-adjusted PCDD, PCDF, and PCB serum concentration
data from the NHANES 2001­2002 survey were linked to
gender, race, smoking status, and age demographics
using the unique survey participant identifier assigned to
each subject. Only data from participants with complete
PCDD/F and PCB profiles were selected for analysis.
PCDD/F and PCB TEQs for individual subjects were
calculated by summing the product of each congener's
concentration and the associated WHO2006
TEF (Van den
Berg et al., 2006).
Total TCDD TEQs were calculated for four different data
subsets. The first two, TEQPCDD/F
and TEQPCB
, were
determined using only the contributions from the 17 PCDD/
F or nine PCB congeners that the CDC measured,
respectively. The third, TEQ17-9
, was calculated using
contributions from all 17 PCDD/F congeners plus all nine
PCB congeners, whereas the fourth, TEQ17-3
, used contribu-
tions from all 17 PCDD/F congeners plus the three coplanar
PCB congeners (PCBs 81, 126, and 169). TEQ concentra-
tions were characterized by gender, race, smoking status, and
age. In accordance with the guidelines provided by the
National Research Council's Committee on Human Bio-
monitoring for Environmental Toxicants (NRC, 2006),
weighted summary statistics, including mean, geometric
mean, and 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles, were calculated
using the dioxin subset-specific 2-year weights included in the
NHANES dioxin data file (NCHS, 2005a) and using
SYSTAT 11.0. Ninety-five percent (95%) confidence inter-
vals for weighted mean TEQ levels and standard errors for
geometric means were calculated using SUDAAN 9.0. The
average percent contribution of each congener to the total
TEQ was calculated by averaging the percent contribution of
that congener to the total TEQ across all subjects.
Missing-Data Analysis
We tested the robustness of various estimates using both
WHO1998
and WHO2006
TEFs to assess whether excluding
individuals without complete congener profiles biased results
we reported previously (Ferriby et al., 2007) as well as the
summary statistics presented here. Of the 1693 adult (i.e., 20
years and older) NHANES participants for whom serum
data were analyzed, 1081 had complete congener profiles,
163 had data for one to nine congeners, 305 individuals had
missing data for all 17 PCDD/F congeners, and 144
individuals had missing data for all 26 dioxin-like congeners.
The latter two groups were excluded from this analysis
because these individuals had missing data (due to laboratory
QA/QC problems) for the majority of congeners (between
65% and 100%), making it difficult to accurately impute
values. Using data from individuals with complete congener
profiles, the average percent contributions for the TEQPCDD/F
and TEQ17-9
sums were calculated with both WHO1998
and
WHO2006
TEFs. Total TEQ concentrations for the 163
individuals missing between one and nine congeners
were subsequently imputed using Eq. (1), and the TEQ of
individual missing congeners was determined using Eq. (2).

SYSTAT software was then used to calculate mean and 95th
percentile TEQ concentrations for individuals 20 years and
older (n ¼ 1244), and for certain subpopulations listed in
Tables 1 and 2. Percent difference for each statistic (i.e.,
mean, 95th percentile) was calculated as (New Stat.ÀOld
Stat.)/Old Stat., and averages were calculated for each
statistic by TEQ sum (i.e., TEQPCDD/F
and TEQ17-9
).

Results
Descriptive Statistics
Summary statistics for the four data subsets, TEQPCDD/F
,
TEQPCB
, TEQ17-9
, and TEQ17-3
, are presented by gender,
age, race, and smoking status in Table 1a­d. Consistent with
the results of our first study (Ferriby et al., 2007), an
increasing trend in mean total TEQ was observed with
increasing age such that individuals 20­29 years had average
levels that were approximately one-third of those for the
oldest group. As before, higher total TEQ body burdens
were also noticed for non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites
relative to individuals of Hispanic origin and those categor-
ized as ``Other Race''.
Table 2a­d presents the results for gender stratified by age
and smoking status, and for smoking status stratified by age.
Even after adjusting for gender and smoking status, the
increasing trend with age was very evident, again suggesting
age as a dominant predictor of body burden. However, as
observed in our previous study (Ferriby et al., 2007), both
smoking status and gender influenced concentrations in the
oldest individuals. Indeed, whereas non-smokers 60 years
and older had three times the concentration of non-smokers
of 20­29 years, those individuals 60 years and older who
were smokers had only twice the body burden as smokers
20­29 years old. Collectively, these results confirm the
existence of a complex interaction between age, smoking
status, gender, and total TEQ serum levels.
Percent Contribution to Total TEQ
The percent contribution of the four main classes of
congeners, PCDDs, PCDFs, coplanar PCBs, and mono-
ortho PCBs, to the total TEQ17-9
was 59%, 18%, 18%, and
5%, respectively. Similar to results in our previous study
(Ferriby et al., 2007), 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD; 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-PeCDD;
1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8-HxCDD; 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-PeCDF; and PCB 126
still contributed the most to total TEQ, accounting for 68%
of the total TEQ17-9
(Figure 1). However, both PCBs 156
and 157 were no longer significant contributors, instead being
displaced by 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-HxCDF and PCB 169, which
accounted for another 6% of the total TEQ (Figure 1).
Overall, these results demonstrate that the effects the
WHO2006
TEFs had on total body burden are consistent
with the change in scale of the TEF approach. For example,
the decrease in TEFs for the mono-ortho-substituted PCBs
has appreciably decreased their contribution to total TEQ
from 28% to 5%, whereas the increase in the TEF for PCB
169 amplified the contribution of this congener from 0.8% to
3%. The changes in contribution observed with WHO2006
TEFs are also apparent when comparing results presented in
Table 1c and d in our original paper (Ferriby et al., 2007)
with those in Table 1c and d of this report. Using WHO2006
TEFs, TEQ17-9
was approximately equal to TEQ17-3
, which
was further evidenced by the finding that, on average, mean
total TEQ17-9
and mean total TEQ17-3
were 31% and 25%
higher than mean total TEQPCDD/F
, respectively. This is in
contrast to the findings presented in our previous publication
where we reported that mean total TEQ17-9
was 64% higher
than mean total TEQPCDD/F
, whereas mean total TEQ17-3
was only 21% higher (Ferriby et al., 2007). Differences in
TEQs resulting from changes to the TEFs were also observed
within groups; however, these differences were more evident
in groups with higher serum levels than in groups with lower
levels. For example, serum TEQ17-9
concentrations for
individuals 60 years and older were reduced from 50.9 to
38.9 p.p.t., whereas those for individuals 20­29 years old
dropped from 18.5 to 13.5 p.p.t.
Impact of LODs on Reference Values
As illustrated in Figure 2, five of the top seven congeners, 1,
2, 3, 6, 7, 8-HxCDD; 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-PeCDF; 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-
HxCDF; and PCBs 126 and 169, had greater than 65% of
samples with concentrations above the LOD, thus reducing
the impact these congeners' detection limits had on the total
calculated TEQ. Additionally, these five congeners also had
low average LODs (Figure 2), thereby further minimizing the
impact of the LOD for these congeners on the total TEQ. In
contrast, both 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD and 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-PeCDD had
low percentages of samples, 13% and 35%, respectively, with
concentrations above the LOD. Because these congeners
contributed appreciably to total TEQ and their average
LODs were higher than the other congeners (2.7 and 2.8 pg/g

lipid, respectively), they are more likely to impact TEQ
estimates, primarily for younger individuals (i.e., less than 30
years of age), as they have the highest percentage of non-
detected results (Ferriby et al., 2007). Although it is doubtful
that these LODs would result in considerable overestimation
of total TEQ17-9
levels for individuals 20­29 years old, the
application of the descriptive statistics presented here for
interpreting biomonitoring results of younger individuals
should be conducted with discretion and these limitations
acknowledged.

Impact of Excluding Individuals without Complete
Congener Profiles
A total of 1693 NHANES participants 20 years and older
were included in the dioxin subsample, with 449 individuals
missing all 17 PCDD/F congeners. Of these 449 participants,
144 individuals had missing data for all 26 congeners (17
PCDD/Fs and 9 PCBs) and 305 individuals had missing data
for all 17 PCDD/Fs but had serum data for the nine PCBs.
Separately, a total of 163 individuals had missing data for
one or more congeners, with the number of congeners
missing ranging from one to nine. Specifically, there were 74
individuals missing data for one congener, 36 missing data
for two, 14 missing data for three, 6 missing data for four, 11
missing data for five, 11 missing data for six, 5 missing data
for seven, 3 missing data for eight, and 3 individuals missing
data for nine congeners.
When data were reanalyzed to include the 163 individuals
who had data missing for between one and nine congeners
(n ¼ 1244), the average percent difference in the mean
and 95th percentile TEQPCDD/F
was 3.4% and 3.3%,
respectively, using WHO1998
TEFs, and 3.2% and 3.5%,
respectively, using WHO2006
TEFs (Figure 3a). For TEQ17-
9
, the average percent difference in mean and 95th percentile
estimates was 2.6% and 3.0% (WHO1998
TEFs),
respectively, and 2.4% and 1.9% (WHO2006
TEFs),
respectively (Figure 3b).
Evaluation of differences in estimates for specific sub-
groups revealed that only 95th percentile values were
noticeably impacted by including the 163 participants with
imputed concentrations. In particular, 95th percentile
TEQPCDD/F
and TEQ17-9
values (WHO1998
and WHO2006
TEFs) for males aged 20­29 years were underestimated by
between 12.3% and 26.6%, whereas TEQPCDD/F
estimates
(WHO1998
TEFs) for males aged 60 þ years and females
aged 30­44 years, and TEQ17-9
estimates (WHO2006
TEFs)
for males 44­59 years, were underestimated by B11%. In
spite of this, 95th percentile TEQPCDD/F
and TEQ17-9
estimates presented both here and by Ferriby et al. (2007)
never varied, on average, by more than 1.3 and 1.2 p.p.t.,
respectively (Figures 3a and b).
Overall, the results of our missing-data analysis suggest
that the TEQ estimates presented by Ferriby et al. (2007) and
in this paper may have been (e.g., estimates would only be

these congeners had on total TEQ concentrations. In contrast, 2, 3, 7,
8-TCDD and 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-PeCDD may slightly affect total TEQ
estimates for younger individuals (i.e., 20­29 years) because these

fractions of samples with concentrations greater than the LOD, and
(3) had higher average LODs. *WHO 2006 TEFs.

underestimated if there were no other underlying analytical
problems with the individuals that have missing data) slightly
underestimated, but not considerably biased, by excluding
individuals without complete congener profiles. Indeed, in
underestimating 95th percentile concentrations, we have, to
some extent, provided reasonably conservative reference
values for assessing exposure to the dioxin-like compounds.
Discussion
Over the past several decades, biomonitoring has been
increasingly utilized by a variety of industrial and manufac-
turing businesses, as well as governmental agencies, to assist
in evaluating the potential exposure of particular populations
to a wide range of chemicals. The benefits of biomonitoring,
nonetheless, are severely limited if data cannot be interpreted.
Certainly, interpretation of biomonitoring data and use of
these data as an exposure-assessment tool involve under-
standing how the concentration of a particular chemical in an
exposed individual compares with its concentration in
the general population (NRC, 2006). To that extent, the
descriptive statistics provided by our analyses of
the NHANES data will prove useful when evaluating the
PCDD/F and PCB serum concentrations of individuals or
populations potentially exposed to these compounds. Indeed,
the National Research Council's Committee on Human
Biomonitoring for Environmental Toxicants recently re-
ported that data may be interpreted by a descriptive
approach in which a statistical review of the data is presented
to relate the results of a study population with those of a
comparable or reference population (NRC, 2006). Following
this paradigm, we believe we have adequately described the
NHANES PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB serum data for the
purposes outlined by the NRC. While the importance of
presenting biomonitoring results for PCDD/Fs and dioxin-
like PCBs is apparent, it is imperative to note that the results
presented here are not intended for use in interpreting health
risks or the potential health status of groups or individuals
exposed to these chemicals.

(b) when including the 163 subjects
with imputed congener concentrations in the data analysis. Overall, the percent difference in mean and 95th percentile estimates indicated that the
results presented by Ferriby et al. (2007) and here were not considerably biased.
