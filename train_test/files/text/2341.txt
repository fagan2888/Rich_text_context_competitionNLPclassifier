Abstract This paper uses data on daily activities from the American Time Use
Survey and the associated Eating & Health Module to analyze the relationships
between time poverty and specific energy-balance behaviors. The authors estimate
a simultaneous model to jointly analyze the relationships between time poverty
and the probability of a fast food purchase, the number of eating and drinking
occurrences, minutes spent engaging in sports and exercise, and the probability of
engaging in active travel (walking or cycling). Time-poor individuals were found
to have different eating and physical activity patterns than non-time-poor individ-
uals; those who were time-poor were less likely to purchase fast food and also less
likely to engage in active travel.

Introduction
Time poverty is defined as not having enough discretionary time.
Discretionary time is important for restorative purposes and for invest-
ment in one's health and human capital; it is also important for avoiding
social exclusion (Bittman 2002). This study defines an individual's daily
discretionary minutes by subtracting minutes of necessary and committed
time from 1,440 (total daily minutes) as done in Kalenkoski, Hamrick, and
Andrews (2011). Necessary activities are those activities that must be per-
formed by an individual for him- or herself (sleep, grooming, health-
related self-care, and other personal and/or private activities). Committed
activities are those that must be performed due to previous life choices
such as whether to marry, to divorce, to have and raise children, and to be
employed (time spent in household work, time spent in child care, time

spent caring for household adults, and time spent in employment or
related activities).1 Although an individual has the ability to make mar-
riage, divorce, fertility, and employment choices over time, on a given day
these choices have already been made, and their associated time commit-
ments are thus essentially fixed. Therefore, although each individual tech-
nically has 24 hours in a day, different people face different discretionary
time constraints depending on their life circumstances.
This study hypothesizes that time-poor individuals may not be able to
prepare and eat healthy meals or to exercise. These hypotheses are tested
by estimating a simultaneous model that jointly analyzes the relations
between time poverty and fast food purchases, the number of eating and
drinking occurrences, minutes spent engaging in sports and exercise, and
engaging in active travel (walking or biking twenty minutes or more).
Better understanding of Americans' eating and activity behaviors can
provide insight into policies and programs that address obesity issues.
Theory
In the standard labor-leisure model, discretionary time, T, is divided
into two categories, labor and leisure. Paid work would fall under the cat-
egory of labor, while preparing and eating healthy meals and exercising
would fall under the category of leisure. While predictions from the
model based on T can be made, most analyses assume that T is fixed and
is the same for all individuals. However, due to people's differing com-
mitments, for example, due to a minimum amount of child care that must
be performed, people do indeed have different levels of discretionary
time. In figure 1, individual 1 has more discretionary time, T1
, than indi-
vidual 2, T2
. Because the individuals' discretionary time is different, the
maximum hours that they work and the maximum income from their
work are different, even if their wage rates are the same. Consequently,
individual 1, with greater discretionary time, will be able to attain a
labor-leisure choice on a higher indifference curve with greater utility (U1
)
than individual 2 (U2
). Labor-leisure choice A on U1
allows for more
hours worked and more income (I1
), but also more discretionary hours
(D1
) than individual 2's choice B with less income (I2
) and less discretion-
ary time (D2
).
Literature Review
The concept of time poverty is not new. Vickery (1977), Douthitt (2000),
and Davis and You (2011) modified existing income poverty thresholds to
account for time constraints. Gershuny (2011) developed the "triangle of
daily activities," which includes leisure, unpaid work, and paid work to
represent work-life balance when measuring national well-being. Other
authors defined time poverty and calculated time poverty thresholds for
various countries: Bardasi and Wodon (2006) for Guinea; Harvey and
Mukhopadhyay (2007) for Canada; McGinnity and Russell (2007) for
Ireland; Burchardt (2008) for the United Kingdom; Spinney and Millward

(2010) for Canada; and Kalenkoski, Hamrick, and Andrews (2011) for the
United States. Zacharias (2011) compared alternative approaches to defin-
ing time and income poverty and discussed their potential role in anti-
poverty policies.
Fewer studies, however, have investigated the associations of time
poverty and individuals' behavior. Mothersbaugh, Hermann, and Warland
(1993) examined the relationship between perceived time pressure and
people's adherence to recommended dietary practices (RDPs), and found
that perceptions of time pressure do indeed have adverse effects on indi-
viduals' eating habits and RDPs. Although he did not directly measure
time poverty, Christian (2009) found that longer commutes were associated
with less time spent in exercise and other health-related activities, and were
also associated with substitution into lower-intensity exercise. In addition,
he found that longer commutes increase the likelihood of non-grocery food
purchases. Spinney and Millward examined the associations between time
and income poverty and participation in moderate or higher intensity phys-
ical activities, and concluded that " . . . time poverty may be more important
than income poverty as a barrier to regular physical activity," (Spinney and
Millward 2010).
Eating patterns have been found to matter for health outcomes. By
using the Seasonal Variation of Blood Cholesterol Study data, Ma et al.
(2003) found that a greater number of eating episodes per day was associ-
ated with a lower risk of obesity. Using the American Time Use Survey
(ATUS) Eating and Health (EH) Module data, Hamermesh (2010) found a
similar result, that the frequency of eating meals (primary eating occur-
rences) and grazing (secondary eating occurrences) were associated with
lower BMI and better self-reported health. Kolodinsky and Goldstein
(2011) also used the ATUS and EH Module data to investigate the relation-
ships between time use and food patterns and obesity, and found that

increases in time spent in meal preparation and cleanup are associated
with decreases in BMI.
Eating food away from home (FAFH) also has been found to matter for
health outcomes. Binkley, Eales, and Jekanowski used the 1994-96
Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII) and found a pos-
itive relationship between respondents' BMI and FAFH consumed in the
previous 24 hours. They concluded that "FAFH, and particularly fast food
consumption, are likely to be contributing factors to increased obesity,"
(Binkley, Eales, and Jekanowski 2000). Todd, Mancino, and Lin, using the
1994-96 CSFII and the 2003-04 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) data, concluded that FAFH " . . . is a contributing factor
to poor diet quality and that concern about FAFH's effect on obesity is
warranted," (Todd, Mancino, and Lin 2010). These authors also found that
one additional meal eaten away from home increases daily caloric intact
by about 134 calories, and lowers diet quality by two points on the
Healthy Eating Index.
Looking specifically at fast food, the literature is mixed on the effects of
fast food on obesity. Binkley et al. (2000) and Jeffery et al. (2006) found
that fast food consumption was positively associated with BMI. Mehta
and Chang (2008) studied food environment and found that a higher ratio
of fast food to full-service restaurants was associated with higher BMIs.
Bowman and Vinyard (2004) found an association between fast food con-
sumption and overweight status, but characterized that relationship as
being weak. However, Cutler et al. (2003) found that Americans' increased
caloric intake is from more snacks, whereas the increase in fast food con-
sumption is a result of reduced home consumption. Thus, fast food calo-
ries are offsetting fewer calories eaten at home. Despite this mixed
evidence, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies report
(2012) categorizes fast food restaurants as "unhealthy food venues" (p. 3).
Physical activity also affects health outcomes. Hemmingsson and
Ekelund (2007) collected their own data measuring physical activity with
accelerometry, and tested the generally-accepted inverse relationship
between physical activity and BMI. They found that physical activity and
BMI are only weakly associated for non-obese individuals, but are highly
significantly associated for obese individuals. Stamatakis, Hirani, and
Rennie (2009) investigated the relationships of physical activity types--
from inactive to sufficiently active for obesity prevention--and sedentary
behavior with BMI using the 2003 Scottish Health Survey. These authors
concluded that physical activity and sedentary behavior are both strongly
and independently related to obesity, for obesity defined as BMI 30 kg/
m2 and waist circumference (WC) 88 cm in women and 102 cm in
men. Dunton et al. used the 2006 ATUS and EH Module data to examine
the interaction between time spent in physical activity and in sedentary
behavior on BMI. They concluded that "sedentary behaviors and physical
activity interact with each other in relation to BMI in adults," (Dunton
et al. 2009).
Long-run trends in obesity have also been studied (Cutler et al. 2003;
Variyam 2005), and a variety of environmental factors have been identified
as contributing to these long-run trends. Powell and Chaloupka (2009)
point to the decline in food prices and the increase in the availability of fast

food and restaurant meals, and Chou et al. (2004) point to the increased
price of cigarettes and the reduction in smoking. Another important con-
tributor to the increase in Americans' body size has been the changing
nature of work. Both technological advances and industrial restructuring in
the United States have resulted in the decline in physical exertion required
for performing paid work. Philipson and Posner stated this trend concisely
by noting that in an agricultural or industrial society, "work is strenuous;
in effect, the worker is paid to exercise," whereas in a post-industrial
society, "people must pay for undertaking--rather than be paid to under-
take--physical activity" (Philipson and Posner 2003). As a result, individu-
als then pay for exercise by budgeting their recreational time. "The full
price of physical activity is the opportunity cost of allotted time--the value
of the most preferable alternative given up by allotting time for a walk in
the neighborhood or a run in the park" (Variyam 2005).
The contribution of the present study is to utilize the very detailed and
comprehensive ATUS data to examine both sides of the energy-balance
equationÂ­both input and expenditure of energy. As such, it analyzes how
time poverty is associated with fast food purchases, the number of eating
and drinking occurrences, the number of minutes engaged in sports and
other exercise, and time engaged in active travel.
Data
The Bureau of Labor Statistics' American Time Use Survey data were
used for this study. One individual aged 15 or older from each sampled
household was interviewed about his or her activities for the 24-hour
period from 4 A.M. the day before the interview to 4 A.M. the day of the
interview. Survey respondents were asked to identify their primary activ-
ity if they were engaged in more than one activity at a time. They were
also asked to report where they were and who else was present for each
activity. In addition to the time-diary data, demographic, labor force par-
ticipation, and household information was collected from the respondents.
This study used the Respondent, Activity, Activity Summary, and
Methodology (Case History) files from the ATUS, as well as the EH
Module Respondent, Activity, and Replicate Weights files. The analysis
was limited to the years 2006-2008 because the EH files were available for
this period only.2 From 2006-08, the ATUS and EH Module resulted in
37,832 completed interviews of individuals aged 15 or over. The replicate
weights from the EH Module produce nationally-representative estimates
for an average day over this period. Excluding those with bad diaries,3

3After each ATUS interview is completed, the Census interviewer answers two data quality questions:
"Is there any reason the information from this interview should NOT be used?" and "Why do you
think the data should not be used?" In 275 cases of the 37,832 completed interviews, the Census inter-
viewer thought that the respondent's time diary was not of good quality, as indicated by the variable
TUDQUAL2 from ATUS Case History data file. We defined a poor-quality time diary as one where
TUDQUAL2 had a value of 1 (intentionally wrong), 2 (could not remember), 3 (deliberately long
durations), or 4 (other reason).

those under age 20, and those that are underweight,4 the resulting sample
size is 32,392.5
One potential drawback of the ATUS diary data is that information on
only one time-diary day per person was collected. There may be concern
that some activities, such as eating fast food or engaging in sports and
exercise, are not daily activities and thus that a one-day diary such as the
ATUS lacks intrapersonal variability. However, some activities, such as
eating patterns, have a large degree of persistency, meaning that
day-to-day variation is minimal; Wansink's (2007) Mindless Eating dis-
cusses the myriad external influences that result in eating habits. Exercise
is also considered to be a habit, and researchers have studied what con-
tributes to habitual exercise (Aarts et al. 1997; Finlay et al. 2002). Indeed,
much of an individual's daily activities can be classified as habitual repeti-
tion (Neal et. al. 2006).
Nevertheless, food intake surveys are typically multiday surveys. For
example, the NHANES includes two 1-day food recall interviews.6
However, because the second-day diaries have a higher rate of non-
response, and because respondents' consistent reports of less food con-
sumption on the second day suggest under-reporting, some researchers
elect to use only the first diary day (Gregory et al. 2012).
Indeed, existing research supports using a one-day diary to analyze
individuals' activity patterns. Lambe et al. (2000) examined food consump-
tion using 14-day diaries in five locations in the European Union. Among
their findings was that the quality of the diaries declined over the 14 days,
with the best information and most variation obtained in the first three
days. However, they found that mean intakes of a given food item were
not affected by survey duration. More recently, Raux et al. (2011) studied
seven-day travel diaries for individuals in Ghent, Belgium, and concluded
that while there is a large amount of interpersonal variability (differences
across individuals in their travel patterns), there is small intrapersonal var-
iability (variation across an individual's seven days of time diaries).
Likewise, Schmidt (2011) studied seven-day diaries of Germans' payments
(consumer expenditures), both cash and noncash, with a focus on cash
payments, and found that survey fatigue is apparent and that more cash
payments were recorded on day one. However, the distribution of pay-
ments during diary days 2Â­7 is similar, leading Schmidt to conclude "that
additional diary days only increase the sample size, rather than provide
additional information" Schmidt (2011).
4We exclude those under 20 years old because the Centers for Disease Control adult BMI interpreta-
tion is for persons aged 20 and over. Body Mass Index is calculated as: weight (lb) / [height (in)]2 Ã
703. Adult BMI groups are underweight (BMI ,18.5), normal weight (18.5  BMI , 25), overweight
(25  BMI , 30), and obese (30 BMI). See CDC for more information on adult BMI: http://
www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html. We exclude those who are underweight because
of the small number of respondents. Those who have a BMI less than 18.5 comprise 1.4% of respond-
ents aged 20 and over with a BMI value. It is the authors' experience that because of the small cell
size, this group's characteristics and patterns can be dominated by a small number of respondents who
engage in activities for a long duration. Having a small number of respondents dominate an estimate,
in some cases as few as 2 respondents, is an indicator that the cell size is not large enough for
analysis.

formed using STATA 12.

Variables
Two measures of eating patterns are available using the ATUS data, an
indicator variable for whether or not fast food was purchased on the diary
day, and the number of eating and drinking occurrences on the diary day
(both primary and secondary).7 Two measures of physical activity can be
created using the ATUS data, minutes spent on sports and exercise (ATUS
activities 1301xx) on the diary day, and an indicator variable for whether
or not the respondent engaged in active travel (walked or biked twenty
minutes or more on the diary day (ATUS activities 18xxxx and
TEWHERE Â¼ 14 or TEWHERE Â¼ 17). Twenty minutes of daily exercise is
a federal guideline for weight management.8
Eating and drinking is a daily activity for almost everyone, and food
consumption away from home takes place several times a week, on
average.9 Active travel is likely to be a daily activity for those who engage
in it, especially if they walk or cycle for all or part of a commute to work.
Therefore, the only measure that is likely to be underestimated by using
one-day diary data is sports and exercise, which is typically not a daily
activity, although it can be considered a habitual activity.
The key explanatory variable in this analysis is an indicator for whether
or not individuals are time-poor. This indicator takes a value of one if
total daily discretionary time is less than 289.8 minutes (4.83 hours), and a
value of zero otherwise. The cutoff of 60% of the median discretionary
time as calculated by Kalenkoski, Hamrick, and Andrews (2011) was
used.10 Discretionary time is defined as total daily minutes (i.e., 1440)
minus time spent on personal care, market work, household work, child
care, and adult care.
Other explanatory variables available in the ATUS are an indicator vari-
able for whether or not the diary day that was a holiday or weekend day;
an indicator variable for whether or not the respondent is female; age
measured in number of years; an indicator variable for whether or not the
respondent is married; the number of children in the household; an
7We defined a fast-food purchase as one where travel (180782) was followed by food purchase (070103)
at a restaurant (TEWHERE Â¼ 4). We included both respondents who ate the food at the restaurant
and those who carried out the food. By including only the 070103 cases with TEWHERE Â¼ 4, we
excluded purchasing food at TEWHERE Â¼ 7 (other store, mall) and TEWHERE Â¼ 11 (other place).
The U.S. Census Bureau has identified that secondary eating at these "other place" locations is usually
at an entertainment venue such as a stadium or movie theater (e-mail correspondence from BLS to
Karen S. Hamrick dated February 29, 2008). By selecting those who pay first, that is, those who pur-
chase at a counter-service restaurant, we excluded those who were at sit-down restaurants and reported
talking with waiters and waitresses or interacting with restaurant cashiers at the end of the meal,
which are also coded as 070103. Including these individuals did not qualitatively change the results.
Also note that selecting those cases where the individual paid first will include both fast food or
quick service restaurants (e.g., McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin' Donuts) and fast
casual restaurants (e.g., Panera Bread, Cosi, Corner Bakery), which tend to have fresher, lighter fare
than fast food restaurants.

9The National Restaurant Association's 2000 survey found that Americans aged 8 and older consume
an average of 4.2 commercially prepared meals per week (National Restaurant Association 2000). Men
are more likely to consume commercially prepared meals. About 22% of men's meals, and about 18%
of women's meals are commercially prepared. Because restaurant sales have increased in real dollars by
about two-thirds from 2000Â­2012 (projected), the frequency of consumption of commercially-prepared
meals is likely to have increased since the 2000 survey (National Restaurant Association 2012).
10Kalenkoski, Hamrick, and Andrews (2011) performed an extensive sensitivity analysis using alterna-
tive definitions of time poverty. The results of those sensitivity analyses are discussed in that paper.

where F* is a latent variable representing a fast food purchase; F is an
indicator variable equal to 1 if fast food was purchased and 0 otherwise;
A* is a latent variable representing active travel; A is an indicator variable
equal to 1 if the respondent engaged in active travel on the diary day and
0 otherwise; TP* is an indicator variable representing non-discretionary
time; TP is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the respondent was time-
poor and 0 otherwise; N is the number of eating occurrences on the diary
day; and S is the number of minutes spent on sports and exercise on the
diary day.
Note that TP is the key explanatory variable in each of the time-use
equations. Because it is a potentially endogenous regressor, it is modeled
jointly with these uses of time. The variable X is a vector of demographic
and other characteristics of the respondent and his/her household, while
Y is a vector of additional variables in the time poverty probit that may
help identify time poverty in the other equations. The B's are estimated
coefficients on the explanatory variables, and the E's are the error terms.
Subscripts for the individual are suppressed for clarity. Because all of the
activities we analyze were engaged in by the same individual, and
because they were all subject to the same time constraint, we allow the
error terms to be correlated across models.
11The EH Module asks respondents whether their household income is greater or less than the dollar
amount of 185% of the poverty threshold, which corresponds with the income eligibility thresholds for
reduced-price school meals and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC). We use the 185% poverty threshold level to define individuals in low-income
households.

Results
Table 1 presents weighted descriptive statistics for the full sample
(those aged 20 and over who participated in the EH module and also pro-
vided good time diaries), and for the time-poor and not time-poor sub-
samples. These descriptive statistics reflect an average day for the years
2006Â­08. There are 6,571 persons (20%) in the sample categorized as time-
poor, and 25,821 persons (80%) are categorized as not time-poor. Eight
percent of Americans aged 20 and older purchased fast food on an
average day. Seven percent of those who were time-poor purchased fast
food, while 9% of those who were not time-poor purchased fast food. The
average number of eating and drinking occurrences12 per day was just
under three, with time-poor individuals having fewer eating and drinking
occurrences (2.7) than not time-poor individuals (2.9). Nineteen minutes
was the daily average number of minutes spent on sports and exercise,
but there was a dramatic difference between the average number of
minutes spent on these activities by those who were time-poor (6 minutes)
and those who were not time-poor (22 minutes). Five percent of respond-
ents were engaged in active travel; 4% of the time-poor and just over 5%
of the not time-poor.
Men were more likely to be time-poor, perhaps because of their greater
labor force participation. Younger individuals were more likely to be time-
poor than older individuals, while married people and people living with
more children in their households were also more likely to be time-poor.
Higher-income individuals were more likely to be time-poor, as were
more highly educated individuals.
Table 2 presents results from a maximum likelihood model that jointly
estimates the fast food and active travel probits and the continuous regres-
sions representing the number of eating and drinking occurrences and the
number of minutes spent on sports and exercise. This model accounts for
correlations in the errors of the activity equations but treats time poverty
as exogenous (i.e., excludes the time poverty equation from the model).
Time-poor individuals have different eating patterns than not-time-poor
individuals. Being time-poor is associated with a reduction in the likeli-
hood of a fast food purchase on an average day by 3%, perhaps due to the
time needed to travel to a fast food establishment and to wait in line; that
is, fast food may not in fact be fast to those with limited time. If fast food
is indeed unhealthy food, this is good news for time-poor individuals.
Time poverty is also associated with a reduction in the number of eating
and drinking occurrences on an average day by 0.27. This is a substantial
effect, given that the average number of eating and drinking occurrences
for the full sample is 2.9. According to Ma et al. (2003) and Hamermesh
(2010), this means a greater risk of obesity for time-poor individuals.
Time-poor individuals also have different activity patterns than do
not-time-poor individuals. Time-poor individuals spend almost 18
minutes less on sports and exercise on a given day than do not-time-poor
individuals, a large effect given that the average time spent by all individ-
uals is almost 19 minutes. Similarly, time-poor individuals are 1% less
likely to engage in active travel than not-time-poor individuals. Thus,
12Eating and drinking occurrences include both primary eating and drinking (eating and drinking
beverages as a main activity) and secondary eating and secondary drinking (eating and/or drink-
ing beverages as a secondary activity while doing something else as the primary activity).

unobserved factor, perhaps a time constraint, that limits long periods for
meals and thus leads to a greater probability of a fast food purchase and
more short eating occurrences throughout the day. RhoFS is the estimated
error correlation between a fast food purchase and the number of minutes
spent on sports and exercise; it is negative and statistically significant, sug-
gesting that an unobserved factor, such as a preference for a healthy life-
style, leads to a lower likelihood of a fast food purchase and more minutes
spent on sports and exercise. RhoNA, the estimated error correlation
between the number of eating and drinking occurrences and active travel,
is positive and statistically significant, perhaps also reflecting an unob-
served preference for healthy living. Finally, RhoSA is the estimated error
correlation between the number of minutes spent on sports and exercise,
and the probability of active travel; it is positive and statistically signifi-
cant, again suggesting that a person's desire to have a healthy lifestyle
leads to more time spent on sports and exercise and a greater likelihood of
walking or biking more than 20 minutes on an average day.
Table 3 presents results that control for the possibility that time poverty
is endogenous13 (i.e., a time poverty probit is added to the previous simul-
taneous equations model). Time poverty may be endogenous because it
depends on time spent in other activities such as personal care, market
work, and household work. Although we have argued that these daily
activities are largely fixed given prior commitments to work and family,
there may be discretionary time spent on these activities that was jointly
chosen with time spent eating and engaging in physical activity.
Once the potential endogeneity of time poverty is controlled for, time
poverty is no longer a statistically significant determinant of the number
of eating and drinking occurrences, or the number of minutes spent on
sports and exercise. However, time-poor individuals are still significantly
less likely to purchase fast food, with time-poor individuals 4% less likely
to make a fast food purchase than not-time-poor individuals. They are
also 2% less likely to engage in active travel. These effects are only slightly
larger in magnitude than those from the model that did not account for

13The results in tables 2 and 3 are presented differently. In table 2, marginal effects and standard
errors of the marginal effects are presented for the probit models. However, the complexity of the model
in table 3 renders calculation of the standard errors of the marginal effects of the probit models inap-
propriate. Indeed, STATA SE 12 refuses to compute them. Thus, in table 3, for the probit outcomes,
coefficient estimates, standard errors of the coefficient estimates, and marginal effects are presented.

endogeneity. Most of the other explanatory variables retain similar effects
across models. Thus, controlling for endogeneity appears only to eliminate
the associations of time poverty with the number of eating and drinking
occurrences and minutes spent on sports and exercise.
It should be noted that no "instruments" are included in the time
poverty equation to identify time poverty in the other equations. Metro
status, the state-level monthly unemployment rate, and the state-level cost
of child care as a percentage of income were all tried as possible instru-
ments, as each could potentially affect an individual's discretionary time.
However, none of these was a significant correlate of time poverty. It is
likely that this lack of significance is due to the limited geographic infor-
mation available in the ATUS, which provides information on the state in
which a respondent lives, but these variables are likely more relevant at
the county or local level. Nevertheless, our model is identified by non-
linearities (Roodman 2011).
Conclusion
Understanding the complexities of Americans' eating and activity
behaviors is important for addressing America's high obesity rate. These
findings on the relationships between time poverty and fast food pur-
chases, the number of eating and drinking occurrences, time spent
engaged in sports and exercise, and active travel shed light on this issue.
To their benefit, time-poor individuals are less likely to purchase fast
food, which is considered by some to be generally unhealthy. This finding
presents the possibility that time-poor individuals are purchasing pre-
pared food from grocery stores or other venues. Research is needed to
better understand convenience foods and their sources. To their detriment,
time-poor individuals are also less likely to engage in active travel. One
possible policy implication of this finding is that policy-makers could con-
sider the development of sidewalks and bike paths to encourage individu-
als to walk or cycle more frequently. Employers could also implement
programs to encourage active travel to work, such as taking steps to earn
the designation of "Bicycle Friendly Business."
