According to Kabat-Zinn (2003) mindfulness is "the aware-
ness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the
present moment, and not judgmentally to the unfolding of
experience moment by moment" (p. 145). Although defini-
tions and perspectives on mindfulness range from its Eastern
origin in Buddhism to its practice in Western behavioral sci-
ence, mindfulness pertains to particular qualities of attention
and awareness. In the West, mindfulness has been growing as
a psychological approach to cultivate positive mental health,
and is often viewed as a technique or collection of techniques
to produce psychological outcomes (Grossman, 2011; Hayes
& Wilson, 2003). Whereas in the East, the practice of mind-
fulness has existed for more than 2,500 years and is consid-
ered "the heart" of spiritual meditation (Thera, 1962). Yet,
Kabat-Zinn (2003) has argued that we are all mindful to a
certain degree, that "it is an inherent human capacity," while
the role of Buddhism in mindfulness is "to emphasize simple
and effective ways to cultivate and refine this capacity and
bring it to all aspects of life" (p. 146).
Mindfulness training in clinical settings increases aware-
ness of automatic reactions to sensations, thoughts, and emo-
tions that increase emotional distress and attempts to reduce
the vulnerability to these mind states. For example, mindful-
ness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been utilized to
reduce the inclination toward negative thinking patterns that
lead to depressive episodes. Patients are taught to "disiden-
tify with or `decenter'from negative self-evaluative, rumina-
tive thinking patterns" and interrupt the automatic habit of
negative thinking patterns and negative emotion (Hick &
Chan, 2010; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002; Teasdale,
1999). Mindfulness interventions may also be an effective
treatment for chronic pain (Green & Bieling, 2012; Kabat-
Zinn, Lipworth, & Burney, 1985), stress (Shapiro, Schwartz,
& Bonner, 1998), panic disorder (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992),
eating disorders (Kristeller & Hallett, 1999), bipolar disorder
(Weber et al., 2010), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD;
Evans et al., 2008).
Many studies of cognitive processing and mindfulness
theory argue that our typical mode of operating is dominated
by automatic processes that reduce our quality of experience

Social Judgments as a Measure
of Right Mindfulness
Robert Lindsay Hakan1, Julia M. Neal1, and John Lothes1
Abstract
Mindfulness should be associated with decreased automatic responding and with increased empathy and compassion.
Therefore, given an opportunity to express judgments about other people, a highly mindful person should be less inclined
to express negative and unnecessary judgments. The present study provided participants the opportunity to express
judgments about photographs of other people in a procedure that attempted to control for potential demand characteristics
associated with self-report measures of mindfulness. Expressed judgments were panel rated, and the derived judgment
scores were regressed with participant scores on the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and the Five Facets of
Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Results demonstrated no overall significant relationship between judgments and MAAS
or FFMQ total scores. However, a significant relationship between judgment scores and the "act with awareness" and the
"non-judgment" facets of the FFMQ was observed. Judgment scores were also related to self-reported involvement in
mindfulness activities such as meditation and yoga. These results suggest that self-reported mindfulness may not completely
align with behaviors that logically reflect right mindfulness. Moreover, social judgment may be a useful overt measure
related to mindfulness. The results also provide empirical evidence of the very strong social tendency to negatively and
often derogatorily judge other people.

1995;). Automatic processes arise without awareness, inten-
tion, or interference from other ongoing mental activity
(Posner & Snyder, 1975; Winter, Uleman, & Cunniff, 1985).
According to Usoof-Thowfeek, Janoff-Bulman, and
Tavernini (2011), automatic reactions even in deliberative
processes become particularly evident when the deliberative
response is associated with emotionally potent negative
reactions (particularly disgust; Rozin, Lowery, Imada, &
Haidt, 1999). Practicing mindfulness requires that one not
only observe their moment-to-moment experiences but also
completely let go of (i.e., nonreact, to) such moments, par-
ticularly negative automatic reactions (Bishop et al., 2004;
Frewen, Evans, Maraj, Dozois, & Partridge, 2008 Martin,
2002; O'Driscoll, 2009). According to Kabat-Zinn et al.
(1992), there is potential for disconnection between oneself
and one's own thoughts (i.e., "the insight that one is not
one's thoughts") that allows an individual to realize they
have "a potential range of responses to a given thought" (p.
942). This range allows the individual to choose a response
that is deliberate, as opposed to automatic, resulting in more
volition of control.
To date, the investigation of mindfulness has almost exclu-
sively utilized self-report as its primary measure. Many differ-
ent self-report scales have been created in efforts to measure
mindfulness. The MindfulAttentionAwareness Scale (MAAS;
formulated by Brown & Ryan, 2003), the Five Facets of
Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer, Smith, Hopkins,
Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006), the Cognitive and Affective
Mindfulness Scale (CAMS; Feldman, Hayes, Kumar, Greeson,
& Laurenceau, 2007).), the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness
Skills (KIMS; Baer, Smith, &Allen, 2004), the South Hampton
Mindfulness Questionnaire ("MQ"; Chadwick, Hember, Mead,
Lilley, & Dagnan, 2005), the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory
(FMI; Buchheld, Grossman, & Walach, 2001), the Toronto
Mindfulness Scale (TMS; Lau, Bishop, Segal, Buis, Anderson,
Carlson & Devins, (2006)), and the Philadelphia Mindfulness
Scale (PHLMS; Cardaciotto, Herbert, Forman, Moitra, &
Farrow, 2008) are some of the self-report measures that have
been developed.
The MAAS, created by Brown and Ryan in 2003, consid-
ers mindfulness as "an enhanced attention to and awareness
of current experience or present reality".(p. 822). It consists
of 15 items with a 6-point Likert-type response scale with
possible responses ranging from almost always to almost
never (Baer et al., 2006). Although the MAAS is among the
most commonly used form of mindfulness assessment, it
provides only one overall mindfulness score (much like the
MQ); most other measures delineate multiple elements of
mindfulness. Perhaps the most popular of these measures,
the FFMQ, divides mindfulness into five facets (mindful
observation, mindful describing, acting with awareness, non-
reactivity, and nonjudgment), each with their own point
value. In general, although mindfulness scales vary in differ-
ent ways, they all are self-report measures.
The self-report measure of mindfulness is likely to be
problematic (Grossman, 2011; Lindahl, 2015; Quickel,
Johnson, & David, 2014; Sauer et al., 2013). Although the
results from several studies have supported the validity of
the MAAS and FFMQ (e.g., Brown, Ryan, Loverich, Biegel,
& West, 2011), there is still debate about the overall validity
of such measures (Grossman, 2011; Quickel et al., 2014;
Sauer et al., 2013). One problem may be that the adaptation
of mindfulness to accommodate Western ideals may be dis-
torting (Buddhadasa, 1988; Rosch, 2007). Moreover, it is
very clear that self-report measures have common problems
that can lead to misinterpretations. Perhaps, most notably,
self-report measures are associated with demand character-
istics that may lead to biased responses (Vartanian &
Powlishta, 2001). The term demand characteristic refers to
"task-orienting cues" that may produce subject bias
(Rosnow, 2002). For example, people often have a tendency
to present themselves in a "brighter light" (social desirabil-
ity response sets) than they truly are . Vartanian and
Powlishta (2001) performed a series of studies using the
concept of an imaginary audience to manipulate subject
response. Subject's responses changed when they felt they
were being critically evaluated by the audience. Likewise,
Nichols and Maner (2008) found that having foreknowledge
about the nature of a study would affect the way that partici-
pants responded. Despite that psychologists are quite sensi-
tive to the potential problem presented by demand
characteristics, Nichols and Maner (2008) reported that few
researchers actually attempt to control for demand charac-
teristics. Moreover, demand characteristics appear more
influential when people are asked to rate themselves
(Luchins, 2011). Thus, reporting about one's own "mindful-
ness" may be particularly vulnerable to such biases. Hipol
and Deacon (2012) mentioned that "Demand characteristics
may have artificially inflated respondents' endorsement of
techniques widely considered to be effective, such as those
associated with CBT" (p. 184). We performed a review and
meta-analysis of published studies related to mindfulness
for inclusion of control procedures to decrease demand
characteristics and potential subject bias. We conducted a
search in the PsycINFO database (including only linked full
text publications) published between the years 2012 and
2013. "Mindfulness" was entered as the search title, which
resulted in 141 text-link studies. Each study was examined
for control procedures and/or the use of blinding or disguise
techniques, which would reflect concern for subject bias and
demand characteristics. None of the studies appeared to
have included any relevant control procedures, and only 12
studies described any concern for subject bias or demand
characteristics. Therefore, self-report studies of mindfulness
would be served by the inclusion of control procedures for
demand characteristics and subject bias. Alternatively,
exploration of alternative methods to measure mindfulness
should be explored (Feldman, Hayes, Kumar, Greeson, &
Hakan et al. 3
Laurenceau, 2007; Grossman, 2011; Quickel et al., 2014;
Sauer et al., 2013).
Mindfulness should reduce vulnerability to automatic
responses (Frewen, Evans, Maraj, Dozois, & Partridge,
2008). Although emphasis has been placed on reducing vul-
nerability to automatic self-ruminations, Grossman (2010)
has pointed out that automatic judgments of all kinds are sus-
pended by the mindful one (Bodhi, 1984). Apparently, auto-
matic responses are ubiquitous and include automatic
attitudes toward the self, activation of social stereotypes
(Brewer, 1988; Devine, 1989; Perdue & Gurtman, 1990;
Pratto & Bargh, 1991), social judgment (Murphy & Zajonc,
1993), and social comparison (Devine, 1989; Devine,
Monteith, Zuwerink, & Elliot, 1991). Negative information
appears to be especially prone to automatic processing
(Anderson, 1974; Fiske, 1980; Hamilton & Zanna, 1972;
Lazarus, 1982; Pratto & John, 1991), and social prejudice
and bigotry are likely to involve automatic processes
(Devine, 1989; Devine et al., 1991). For example, over-
weight people are often automatically disliked, ridiculed,
and judged to be lower in intelligence and many other social
characteristics (e.g., DeJong, 1980; Grover, Keel, & Mitchel,
2003; Hebl & Mannix, 2003; Polivy & Herman, 2004).
The current study measures the relationship of mindful-
ness to social judgments. We did this by simply asking peo-
ple their opinions about both famous and nonfamous people
pictured in a survey. The survey was described to partici-
pants as a public opinion survey to disguise its true nature
and reduce potential reactivity. Pilot investigations indicated
that not only are people frequently willing to give such judg-
ments about people they generally know little about (whether
they are famous or not), they are also often negative and
derogatory in those judgments. Participants' responses to the
"public opinion survey" were then correlated with responses
to the MAAS and to the FFMQ, which were both presented
as "self-reflection" surveys. We argue here that negative
judgments about people who are not directly known are
likely to arise from automatic processes and should be related
to at least some components of common self-report mindful-
ness measures. Moreover, the mindful individual should be
less inclined to express such judgments, automatic or not,
because mindfulness is related to compassionate ethics
(Greenberg & Mitra, 2015) and mindfulness training has
been found to increase compassion, empathy, and "perspec-
tive taking" (Kingsbury, 2009; Shapiro, Astin, Bishop, &
Cordova, 2005; Shapiro, Brown, & Biegel, 2007).
Method
Participants
Roughly half of the subjects (n = 48/99) were randomly
encountered at different school buildings around the campus
of the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW).
Researchers approached participants who appeared to be
alone and uninvolved in any consuming activities, such as
homework or eating. The participants were asked whether
they had 15 to 20 min to participate in a survey. If the partici-
pants agreed, a script was read aloud informing them that the
first of three surveys was a "public opinion survey" about
public figures. The script explained that the survey responses
were anonymous and encouraged participants to answer the
questions as honestly as possible. Other participants (n = 51)
were recruited via a recruitment website and were offered
credit to participate in a scheduled laboratory assessment.
These participants were administered the same surveys in the
same way. The participants as a whole (n = 99) included 36
males and 63 females who were of an average age of 22 years
(SD = 7.9 years). The education status of the sample included
three individuals with high school diplomas, 25 college fresh-
man, 17 college sophomores, 20 college juniors, 24 college
seniors, seven graduate students, and three individuals with
post graduate degrees. The sample consisted of people identi-
fying as Caucasian (n = 85), Asian (n = 5), and Hispanic (n =
9). All procedures were approved by the UNCW Institutional
Review Board (IRB) for human subjects and researchers fol-
lowed all ethical guidelines created by the IRB for studying
human subjects. All subjects read and signed an informed
consent agreement describing their rights as participants.
Materials
The materials for this study included three surveys: the
"Public Opinion Survey" (the Judgment survey; Appendix I),
the FFMQ (Baer et al., 2008), and the MASS (K. Brown &
Ryan, 2003). The researchers constructed the Judgment sur-
vey, which was disguised as a "public opinion survey" when
presented to the participants. The covert nature of the public
opinion survey was intended to reduce demand characteris-
tics and allow or entice expression of social judgments and
opinions from the participant if they were prone to do so. The
logic utilized in the construction of the Judgment survey was
that a more mindful individual would be less likely to express
judgments (particularly negative, unnecessary judgments),
because the automatic nature of negative judgment and ste-
reotyping is contrary to the practice of mindfulness. The
Judgment survey began with a demographics page that col-
lected specific information from participants including age,
gender, current educational status, race, religious affiliation,
and religious devoutness. The next five pages of the survey
included pictures of five different individuals, of which three
were famous (to add credibility to the public opinion survey
disguise). Pictures were chosen with the following criteria:
All were of roughly the same size and image quality, and
based on research panel assessment, all pictures were pre-
dicted to elicit negative judgments in many participants (how-
ever, pilot investigations suggested strongly that almost any
individual presented in the photographs would be effective).
Two of the pictures were of anonymous individuals who were
found on the Internet by the researchers. The celebrity photos

were of pop singer, Justin Bieber; reality TV star, Snooki
Pollizi; and heavyweight boxing champion, Mike Tyson. The
two anonymous pictures included one female and one male.
The female was shown in a suggestively provocative pose,
whereas the male was frequently described as being "nerdy."
Beneath each picture, the survey asked, "Do you know who
this is? Who?" and "What do you think about this person?" If
participants did not know who the individual was, they were
still asked to give their opinion of the individual. Each photo
was followed by scales, where participants rated the individ-
ual on intelligence, style, and morality. The scales were
included to reduce attention to the primary dependent vari-
able (their open-response judgments). The final section of the
survey was constructed to examine regressions between their
expressed judgments, and their involvement in yoga, medita-
tion, or martial arts as well as other (disguise) activities
(working out, watching TV, reading, listening to music, out-
door recreations, shopping, and crafts). Participants were
asked to rate how often they participated in each activity on a
scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very frequently).
The FFMQ and MAAS were administered on computers
through the "Select Surveys" website (http://appserv01.uncw.
edu/selectsurveynet/SurveyList.aspx). The FFMQ is a
39-item survey that was developed from the KIMS. The
FFMQ measures five specific facets of mindfulness: observ-
ing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging of inner
experience, and nonreactivity to inner experience. Items
related to these five facets are rated on a 5-point Likert-type
scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very
often or always true). Higher scores are argued to reflect more
mindfulness (Baer et al., 2008). The MAAS is a 15-item sur-
vey that is also commonly used to assess the mindfulness of
an individual. The specific purpose of the MAAS is to mea-
sure the presence or absence of attention to, and awareness of,
the present moment. Each question describes an event, and
respondents indicate on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging
from 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never) how often they
recall experiencing that event (K. Brown & Ryan, 2003).
Procedure
The participants were read a script that explained that three
surveys would be presented. The surveys were given in a spe-
cific sequence with the Judgment survey presented first so
that the mindfulness surveys could not potentially prime par-
ticipants to respond more mindfully than they otherwise
would. The first pictured page of the Judgment survey (Justin
Bieber) was completed in an interview process with the
researcher to insure that they understood the nature of the
questions. The participants completed the rest of the survey
independently. Researchers were careful to avoid any discus-
sion of the concept of mindfulness; and to further reduce
demand characteristics, the FFMQ and the MAAS were pre-
sented as self-reflection surveys. The subset of participants
who were recruited around campus (n = 48) used researchers'
laptops to access the surveys. Participants in the lab (n = 51)
utilized the lab computers.
Results
Three participants were excluded from the data analysis: Two
people did not finish the survey and another participant was
deemed to have provided inauthentic responses. The remain-
ing participants' (n = 99) average FFMQ score was 126.15
(SD = 16.23). The means and standard deviations for each of
the FFMQ subscales, respectively, were FFMQ observe,
27.4/4.9; FFMQ describe, 27.15/5.3; FFMQ act with aware-
ness, 25.03/5.57; and FFMQ nonjudge, 25.56/5.53. The mean
MAAS score was 49.265 (SD = 11.04). A frequency analysis
indicated that the scores on these mindfulness measures were
normally distributed (see Figures 1 and 2).

The Public Opinion Surveys (Judgments)
The researchers rated Judgment survey comments for each
photo (n = 5) on a 7-point Likert-type scale where 1 was
extremely positive, 7 was extremely negative, and 4 was
neutral. Scoring of expressed judgments differentiated
between description, preferences, and outright derogatory
judgments. Higher total judgment scores, therefore, were
associated with more negative and derogatory judgments.
Each comment was read and rated independently (n = 4
researchers) and the average of the ratings was taken if
there was disagreement. The average total judgment score
was 23.13 (SD = 2.93). A total "judgment score" was calcu-
lated for each participant by adding five averaged ratings of
the participant's comments on the Judgment survey. A fre-
quency analysis demonstrated relatively normal distribu-
tion for "total judgment scores" (see Figure 3); many
comments were positive or neutral, but a significant pro-
portion of the comments were negative (n = 68; mean judg-
ment scores above 4) or very negative (n = 20; mean above
5). For example, derogatory comments such as "Slut" or
"Whore" in reference to the anonymous female, and com-
ments such as "lesbian fag" in reference to Justin Bieber
were frequently encountered.
To conduct a simple regression between FFMQ, MAAS,
and judgment scores, the judgment scores were first normal-
ized. Total judgment scores for each subject were divided by
5 (the number of comments made by each participant) to pro-
duce an average judgment score. The difference between the
average judgment score and 4 (the neutral point of our rating
scale) was calculated. It was found that the normalized judg-
ment scores did not have a significant regression relationship
with the FFMQ total score, or the MAAS scores (see Table 1).
A similar regression was assessed between the normalized
judgment scores and each of the five facets of the FFMQ.
Significant relationships between normalized judgment
scores and FFMQ subscales were found for only two of the
five facets, "act with awareness" (Figure 4) and "non-judg-
ment of inner experience" (Figure 5).
The relationship between normalized judgment scores
and self-reported mindfulness activities such as, yoga, medi-
tation, and martial arts was assessed (Figure 6). Because of
relatively low representation of any individual mindfulness
activity, self-reported involvement in yoga, meditation, and
martial arts were summed. The relationship of "normalized
judgment scores" to reported mindfulness involvement was
found to be significant, F(1, 96) = 4.17, p = .04. Normalized
judgment scores were not significantly related to any other
self-reported activities (TV watching, listening to music,
shopping, working out, reading, outdoor recreation, and
crafts). Researchers then analyzed whether the MAAS or the
FFMQ predicted participation in any of the listed activities.
A significant relationship was indicated between the FFMQ
and total mindfulness activity scores (mean mindfulness
activities score = 5.39/std 2.55), F(1, 98) = 5.36, p = 0.02, but
was not observed between the MAAS and the total mindful-
ness activities score. The FFMQ or the MAAS did not pre-
dict participation in any of the self-reported nonmindfulness
activities.
Although positive judgments might be considered auto-
matic social responses, we considered the idea that positive
judgments, in some way, differed from automatic negative
judgments. Simple regressions were conducted in which sub-
jects who had positive judgment scores (generally made
positive judgments about pictured individuals) were elimi-
nated from analysis (n = 12). A regression of this data subset
(the remaining normalized judgment scores that excluded the
positive subjects) revealed significant regressions between
these judgment scores and the FFMQ total (r = .211), F(1,
86) = 3.95, p = .05, and between the FFMQ subscale for act
with awareness (r = .308), df(1, 75), F = 7.7, p = .006, and a
trend relationship with FFMQ nonjudgment scores (r =
.204), df(1, 75), F = 3.22, p = .07. Regression analysis of the
normalized data, without participants who demonstrated
positive judgment scores with total mindfulness activities
was also significant (r = .304), F(1, 86) = 8.6, p = .004. A
trend relationship between the negative scores with MAAS
scores (r = .202), F(1, 84) = 3.97, p = .057, was also observed.
Additional simple regressions were run to assess the rela-
tionship between self-reported mindfulness scores and
"judgment scores" for celebrity versus anonymous photos.
The results were not significant; participants judged people
similarly regardless of whether the pictured individual was
known or unknown. In addition, gender and age (though our
age range was fairly truncated) did not appear to play a role
in these effects.
Each photograph was accompanied by rating scales for
participants to provide further evaluations of the pictured
individuals.Although they were meant to be part of the exper-
imental disguise, these ratings were assessed. The total rat-
ings across intelligence, style, and morality were summed,
and a regression was conducted between summed ratings and

the judgment scores derived from their open-ended com-
ments. The relationship between these ratings and judgment
scores demonstrated a strong positive relationship (Table 2
and Figure 8); as FFMQ total scores increased, so did positive
ratings on these scales. Likewise, there was a significant
regression relationship between scaled responses and FFMQ
total (see figure 7), but not between these scaled response rat-
ings and other FFMQ subscales or MAAS scores (Table 2).
Discussion
The hypothesis of the present study was that mindfulness
should be inversely related to negative social judgments
because mindfulness training reduces vulnerability to auto-
matic responses (Bodhi, 1984; Grossman, 2010; Kabat-Zinn,
Massion, Kristeller, Peterson, Fletcher, Pbert, Santorelli,
1992 ; Winter et al., 1985) and has been related to increased
empathy and compassion. Negative social judgments about
people who are not directly known to us are likely to reflect
automatic emotional reactions (e.g., Devine, 1989; Murphy &
Zajonc, 1993;). We recognize that one might refrain from
judging for reasons unrelated to mindfulness, but we contend
that in general, the mindfully disposed individual should be
less likely to express such judgment. We found meaningful
regressions between "judgment scores" and two subcompo-
nents of the FFMQ ("act with awareness" and "non-judgment

of inner experiences"). These two facets of the FFMQ do
seem most logically related to automatic social judgment. We
also found that the tendency to judge negatively was inversely
correlated with self-reported involvement in mindfulness
activities (meditation, yoga, and martial arts). This strength-
ens our confidence that social judgment measures are mean-
ingfully related to mindfulness (the same relationship was
observed between FFMQ total scores and mindfulness activi-
ties, but not for the MAAS). Yet, mindfulness practice did not
assure lower judgment scores. Therefore, we may question
the validity of self-reported mindfulness involvement, or we
may question the notion that practice in, and of, itself guaran-
tees actual mindfulness.
The fact that we did not see a significant relationship
between MAAS scores or FFMQ total scores and our social
judgment scores suggests possible issues in the self-report of
mindfulness (Quickel et al., 2014, and see Grossman, 2011;
particularly that mindfulness surveys do not directly measure
automatic response tendencies or judgment of other people).
In addition to issues of bias, mindfulness surveys also require
accurate self-knowledge and memory. This requirement may
be especially difficult given that we may recall inaccurately
and that mindfulness is likely to vary across time and con-
text. A wider issue may exist in the debated connections
between mindfulness as exercised and measured in our
Western culture versus "right mindfulness" that arises from
Buddhist ethical traditions (Greenberg & Mitra, 2015).
Greenberg and Mitra (2015) among others argue that mind-
fulness without ethicality essentially is not mindfulness.
We were concerned in the present study about the poten-
tial subjectivity associated with quantifying open-ended
judgments. To address this concern, we utilized an indepen-
dent panel rating process. Although this does not eliminate
concerns, we did find that our raters had very high inter-rater
reliability (r = .87). Furthermore, the regression between our
ratings of judgment and the participants summed intelli-
gence, style, and morality ratings were very strong. This can
be taken as support for the validity of our panel ratings.
If one accepts the logic that mindfulness should decrease
automatic social judgments, then the failure to find a signifi-
cant relationship between judgment scores and either the
FFMQ total, other FFMQ subscales, or the MAAS scores
further suggests difficulties with these widely used self-
report measures of mindfulness. Self-report measures of per-
sonal, internal, and subjective attributes are particularly
vulnerable to the influence of demand characteristics and
subject bias (Luchins, 2011; Vartanian & Powlishta, 2001),
yet, it appears that the use of mindfulness surveys is rarely, if
ever, accompanied by procedures to reduce this potential
issue. Many studies of mindfulness are likely to have unin-
tentionally included demand characteristics by studying peo-
ple who are engaged in certain mindfulness activities or by

their open-ended comments (judgment scores) and FFMQ total score

context in clinical settings, or by administering surveys with
a description that they are about mindfulness (we have not
found any study where the nature of the surveys has been
disguised). The present study used simple disguise and care-
ful dialogue to reduce subjects' knowledge about the nature
of the surveys and to eliminate any information that might
lead subjects to recognize our ultimate interest in their opin-
ions about "public figures." Although we cannot say whether
subject bias influenced survey responding or not, we do
argue that procedures to minimize subject bias should be a
standard in studies of mindfulness.
The present study provided participants the opportunity
to express their opinions about selected famous and nonfa-
mous individuals pictured in a paper survey. A potential
concern may be that the present results were specific to the
photos that were selected. The pictures were selected by a
panel of researchers with the aim of including individuals
who would likely garner controversial opinions. However,
pilot investigations using a variety of different photo-
graphed individuals produced results that were entirely
consistent with the work reported here. The only apparent
criterion that seems necessary to elicit such judgments is
that the photo be at least slightly provocative. Although a
survey was used, the responses to the survey are argued to
be an overt behavioral manifestation of relative mindful-
ness, because mindfulness training tends to reduce auto-
matic judgments (especially negative ones) and to increase
empathy and compassion. The participants may have had
some knowledge of the famous individuals in the public
opinion survey, based on media accounts of their behavior.
We argue that in reality, even famous people are only indi-
rectly known by most of us, and that the media can greatly
distort their public representation. Nonetheless, there was
no general difference in our participants' tendency to judge
pictures of famous versus nonfamous individuals. We do
not argue that mindful people are free from the tendency to
judge or are immune from harsh judgment of others, rather
that there should be a lower tendency for this kind of
expression. Therefore, even if we had selected pictures of
outrageous public personas, we believe that the mindful
individual will still be less inclined to judge. Perhaps, in
practical terms, it is not possible for any human being to
be completely free of judgment. However it is better that
our judgments are discerning ones, free of automatic,
unchecked, emotionally generated, and potentially counter-
productive impulsive outcomes.
A surprising proportion of judgments were generally
negative and a meaningful percentage (20%) expressed
derogatory evaluations. Although it was not a primary issue
for our study, we think it is important to emphasize the fre-
quency with which highly derogatory comments were
encountered. Although we may all recognize that expression
of negative derogatory opinions are often encountered
within our culture, we may not realize the extent to which
they are occurring.
Conclusion
We have constructed a new measure that we argue represents
one overt reflection of right mindfulness. Automatic social
judgments are easily elicited from participants in a way that
disguises purpose and, therefore, avoids some of the poten-
tial pitfalls of self-report approaches to measuring mindful-
ness. Our results indicate that automatic social judgments are
not related to FFMQ total scores or to MAAS scores but are
related to the FFMQ subscales "act with awareness" and
"non-judge." Social judgment scores did meaningfully pre-
dict involvement in mindfulness type activities such as yoga.
