Introduction
The OpenOrbiter Small Spacecraft Development Initiative at
the University of North Dakota provides a project-based
experiential learning experience for students involved with
the program. Participants have included the full range of uni-
versity students: from freshmen to PhD students. These stu-
dents have served in a variety of roles and have performed
work spanning numerous disciplines of study. Many students
worked on topics related to their major; a few pursued topics
of interest that did not align with their field of academic
study. Numerous teams were instantiated; each was led by a
student team leader and mentored by a faculty member. In
some disciplines (e.g., computer science and electrical engi-
neering), student group leaders managed the interaction
between multiple teams (each of which had its own team
lead). Participants were able to learn new skills and apply
existing skills to a real-world challenge. They also gained
skills related to working with students in different disci-
plines: They learned the vernacular of these different fields
as well as the working styles of their practitioners.
Some students participated in the project to satisfy a proj-
ect component of a course or for independent or directed
study credit. Many, however, participated as volunteers to
gain experience in this real-world project which operated, in
many ways, like an industry project. While the project had
established learning goals (and delivered, based on partici-
pant feedback, some unanticipated learning benefits), it did
not incorporate formal test-based assessment techniques, as
the learning experience and topics varied by individual areas
of participation. Student participants, instead, were asked to
respond to an experience assessment survey, which asked
them to characterize their competence in key learning focus
areas prior to and after program participation. This article
presents and analyzes the responses from a limited number
of undergraduate participants in the program.
Background
The OpenOrbiter program draws on several different areas of
prior work. It is working to design, build, and validate a
CubeSat-class spacecraft, drawing (as would be expected)
heavily on prior work in small spacecraft design. As an expe-
riential or project-based research experience, it also draws on
prior work in the design and operation of these techniques.
Both these topics are now expanded upon.
CubeSat Spacecraft
CubeSats were developed as an educational tool by Robert
Twiggs and Jordi Puig Suari (Deepak & Twiggs, 2012).

Assessing the Value of the OpenOrbiter
Program's Research Experience for
Undergraduates
Jeremy Straub1, David Whalen2, and Ronald Marsh1
Abstract
This article presents an assessment of the benefits gained by undergraduate students who participated in the OpenOrbiter
Small Spacecraft Development Initiative. It provides an overview of the program and its learning objectives, as they apply
to undergraduate students. It compares the learning impact between students who participated and those who assumed
leadership roles. Qualitative assessment with regard to benefits is also discussed. The article extrapolates from these results
to identify program elements that were particularly instrumental in delivering the positive benefits discussed. Finally, future
work is discussed.

use of the spacecraft in educational settings, allowing stu-
dents to, prospectively, be involved in the complete space-
craft design, construction, and validation process during
their academic career. CubeSats have been successfully
developed by numerous institutions (Klofas, 2011; Klofas,
Anderson, & Leveque, 2008; M. Swartwout, 2012; M. A.
Swartwout, 2011). Many (M. Swartwout, 2004; M.
Swartwout, 2011) served educational purposes; more
recently, CubeSats have been used for bona fide research,
communications, and other mission types. CubeSats were
designed to cost a fraction of the price of larger spacecraft
(Straub, 2012); recent work (Berk, Straub, & Whalen, 2013)
has demonstrated that this cost can be driven lower through
the use of publically available design documents and low-
cost, readily available parts.
Experiential Learning for Undergraduates
Experiential learning (also commonly known as problem-
based or project-based learning) has been demonstrated to be
effective at all levels of the educational continuum (Brodeur,
Young, & Blair, 2002; Fevig, Casler, & Straub, 2012; Hall,
Waitz, Brodeur, Soderholm, & Nasr, 2002; Mathers,
Goktogen, Rankin, & Anderson, 2012; Mountrakis &
Triantakonstantis, 2012; Straub, Berk, Nervold, & Whalen,
2013) and across numerous disciplines (Correll, Wing, &
Coleman, 2013; Qidwai, 2011; Reynolds & Vince, 2004;
Robson, Dalmis, & Trenev, 2012; Saunders-Smits, Roling,
Brügemann, Timmer, & Melkert, 2012; Siegel, 2000).
Breiter, Cargill, and Fried-Kline (2013), in the context of
undergraduate hospitality management education, surveyed
industry perception of the value of experiential education
and found that industry perceptions of value included student
learning of technical and management skills as well as learn-
ing related to intangible aspects of the field. In the context of
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
undergraduate education, work (Simons et al., 2012) at
Widener University demonstrated how student participation
in an in-the-field experiential learning exercise increased
student understanding (as both self-assessed by students and
assessed by their field supervisors) of subject material and its
real-world application; it also caused the student participants
to gain a better understanding of the needs and intricacies of
the populations that they were serving. Students also indi-
cated that participation increased their interest in careers in
the field and caused them to learn relevant terminology and
time management skills. They also indicated that they gained
an appreciation of the duties of a professional job in the field
and assessed themselves as "better prepared" for workforce
entry or to pursue graduate studies. Bauerle and Park (2012)
conducted work that demonstrated the value of an experien-
tial exercise in increasing knowledge retention. They found
that students who participated in the experiential exercise
increased homework scores by 12% and the scores of those
who fully participated (including participating in a tree
climbing exercise) increased by 19%. The impact of this
work was the greatest for students outside of the STEM dis-
ciplines participating in the STEM plant science course.
Edwards, Jones, Wapstra, and Richardson (2012) demon-
strated that experiential learning techniques increased stu-
dent engagement. In response to declining honors level (an
optional 4th year program for undergraduate students com-
mon to many institutions outside of the United States) enroll-
ment, they incorporated experiential elements into all 3 years
of their base undergraduate program. While demonstrating
correlation only anecdotally (and failing to account for
Hawthorne effect attributable changes, though the magnitude
of the Hawthorne effect is an open research question; Cook,
1967; Jones, 1992; McCarney et al., 2007), the presented
data suggests that the experiential inclusions stemmed the
significant decline in enrollment experienced in 2002-2006,
with 2007 enrollment at nearly three times the 2006 levels
and 30% to 40% higher than enrollment in 2002-2005. Dym,
Gilkeson, and Phillips (2012) describe the role of experien-
tial elements in the Harvey Mudd College Engineering pro-
gram. They show a significantly significant (at p < .05)
positive difference in the performance of Harvey Mudd
College students as compared with students at 30 other engi-
neering schools. Perhaps more significantly, they demon-
strate the efficacy of and ability of first-year students to
effectively participate in design projects.
OpenOrbiter Program
The OpenOrbiter program is a student-conceptualized, stu-
dent-led program that aims to provide opportunities for stu-
dent research and experience related to spacecraft design and
engineering, software design and practical experience in
many supporting areas. Student team members defined the
project's scope, starting from a loosely defined concept of
building a CubeSat, as well as specific program objectives,
work areas, and timelines. The name, logo, and other project
branding elements were also developed by student partici-
pants. The following sections provide an overview of the
program and its progress, highlight key learning objectives,
and discuss undergraduate participation to date.
Overview
The OpenOrbiter initiative aims to create design materials
for the Open Prototype for Educational NanoSats (OPEN)
concept and to develop a 1-U (10 cm × 10 cm × 11 cm, 1.33
kg) CubeSat-class spacecraft based on these designs. OPEN
is poised to have a positive impact on aerospace engineering,
mission critical system software development, and other
fields through making a complete set of CubeSat designs,
fabrication instructions, testing plans, and other materials
freely available. The OPEN designs target a materials cost of
no more than US$5,000 (Berk et al., 2013; Straub,Korvald et
al., 2013). This places the cost of the spacecraft at a level that
Straub et al. 3
could, in many institutions, potentially be supported by
teaching or institutional funds (as opposed to requiring extra-
mural funding). This reduced cost level also acts to enable
research projects that may not be able to attain the levels of
funding required for more expensive approaches. The
reduced cost level also decreases the impact of failure, allow-
ing more freedom to take risks and allow, in the case of edu-
cational projects, student leadership and decision making.
The OPEN design is different from traditional CubeSats
in that it utilizes vertical insertion of the printed circuit
boards instead of physical stacking of horizontal boards.
Each of the four sides of the spacecraft, shown in Figure 1, is
comprised of a board, which is held in place by corner posts
with a retaining track. Electronic connectors are included in
both the top and bottom plates, which allow electrical stack-
ing of the boards without requiring physical stacking. This
configuration also makes it very apparent if a board is not
completely or properly seated, as the top plate cannot be
locked in place.
The software that will accompany the OPEN design will
run on top of a customized Linux kernel. It has been sepa-
rated into three primary development efforts: operating soft-
ware, payload software, and ground station software. A
verification and validation group assesses the software cre-
ated by the other groups to ensure flight-readiness. The oper-
ating software controls the moment-by-moment operations
of the spacecraft, commanding all sensors, actuators, and
subsystems. The payload software plans payload objective
performance tasks and processes the data collected during
these tasks. The ground station software communicates with
the onboard operating software to convey controller instruc-
tions in the form of new tasks, task cancellations, and task
modifications.
Learning Objectives
A number of learning objectives were set at the beginning of
the OpenOrbiter program. These objectives were identified
based on a combination of the identification of areas where
traditional curriculum was lacking and prospective learning
benefits that could be conveyed by a small spacecraft pro-
gram. These objectives fall into several large categories:
technical skills, communications skills, teamwork skills,
spacecraft design skills, and time/project management skills.
The project also sought to increase student excitement about
their field of technical participation and about space in
general.
The technical skills category is defined as being com-
prised of all elements of the team's work which are not
spacecraft-specific. These categories should have a loose
correlation with a subfield of an academic discipline, based
on how teams were divided. Some teams' work covered a
few related subfields; in a few limited cases, teams were
themselves interdisciplinary due to the nature of the work
they were performing.
The communications skills category covered both work-
place communications and presentation skills.
Communications skills were deemed to be an important
focus, as they are enumerated as a required component of
various discipline-specific accreditation programs. The lack
of interdisciplinary communication skills by graduates was
also identified as a prospective problem (as employers would
be required, in the absence of its correction in academia, to
bear the cost of this reduced productivity and training).
Learning related to these interdisciplinary communications
skills was deemed to be a benefit that could only be produced
by a project, such as OpenOrbiter, with significant interdisci-
plinary participation.
The category of teamwork skills was comprised of the
skills required to participate effectively in a large team.
Unlike many class projects where students self-select a group
of peers with whom (in many cases) they may already be
friends with, OpenOrbiter placed students together based on
their thematic interest. While, certainly, many students knew
one another, the broad promotion of the project campus-wide
resulted in many groups being composed of collections of
individuals who were not previously well acquainted. This
included the pairing of undergraduate and graduate students,
individuals from different disciplines and across multiple
year levels. For this reason, the project was an exercise in
teamwork skills closely resembling the workplace, where
one may be required to work with individuals not previously
known or liked by them.
Spacecraft design skills were comprised of spacecraft
design-specific technical skills. These included skills and the
associated knowledge about the spacecraft design process as
well as knowledge and abilities related to designing for the
harsh and different environment of space. The validation

designs and their implementation for the space environment
was also a critical element of this category.
Time and project management were identified as impor-
tant skills that were also lacking in other areas of the tradi-
tional curriculum. While students might have an
appreciation for managing their own efforts (though for
some, this may be the cram-at-the-last-moment mentality),
working with others in a large interdependent project
requires a significantly more robust skillset. It necessitates
an understanding of what areas represent dependencies for
others (and which do not) to facilitate decision making and
prioritization in a time-resource-constrained environment.
Team and group leaders, in addition to managing their own
time relative to project, academic and other commitments,
also had to learn the skills required to manage the efforts of
others.
While all of these areas were deemed to be important (and
covered by the program in some way), assessment during
this initial period was limited to a subset. Future work will
focus on assessing additional learning objectives.
Undergraduate Participation
Undergraduate participation is ubiquitous throughout the
program. Undergraduates have participated in every team
and have served as team leaders for several teams. One
undergraduate served as a group leader (leading other under-
graduate and one graduate student team leaders).
Undergraduate participation has included individuals who
volunteered, one individual who was funded to work on the
program through a competitive internal (to the university)
undergraduate researcher support program, and individuals
who have participated as part of a class project or indepen-
dent study. There is at least one instance of an individual who
started working on the project as an undergraduate continu-
ing to participate as a graduate student; more transitions of
this type appear imminent.
Undergraduate participants have expressed several gen-
eral classes of reasons for participating. Some partici-pate
because the project and the chance to launch something into
space at the end excite them. Many participate to improve
technical skills in a particular area or to learn a new technical
skill. Others have indicated that their reason for participating
is to gain experience in working on a team project that is
much larger than anything they have been exposed to in
classes. Still others are participating to satisfy a specific
degree or a course objective.
The undergraduates who have participated have expressed
general pleasure with the results so far. Anecdotally, several
examples of the program being discussed in an interview
(and helping the participant secure an internship or position)
have been mentioned to the authors. The following sections
present a more formal assessment of program performance in
undergraduate students.
Results
An assessment survey was distributed to student participants
in the OpenOrbiter program in April 2013 during regular
team meetings. Both graduate and undergraduate students
responded to this survey; however, only the responses of
undergraduates are presented and analyzed in this article.
These students spanned all four undergraduate class levels
(see Table 1) and three disciplines (see Table 2). They ranged
in grade point average (GPA) from 3.0 to 4.0 (see Table 3).
The group surveyed included both individuals who partici-
pated in a team lead role and who participated as team mem-
bers (see Table 4). The average amount of time spent by
participants was also collected; this is presented in Table 5.
Quantitative Results
Improvement in five of the key educational goal areas was
assessed. Reported status by undergraduate students prior to
and after program participation is presented in Figure 2. As

shown in this figure, undergraduates reported improvement
in all five areas. The most significant growth was reported in
spacecraft design skills; the second most was reported in
focus-specific technical skill growth. Figure 3 depicts the
average level of improvement, by category. Figure 4 shows
the average level of improvement enjoyed by those who
showed improvement in a given category. Note that, for the
purposes of calculation, three anomalous prior/post score
combinations (indicating an effective decline) have been
removed. These data points appear to be clerical errors, as
the related attribution levels reported were not negative (as
one would expect if an actual decline had occurred).
Student respondents were then asked to characterize the
program's impact on creating the changes described. They
were asked to rate, on a 9-point scale (ranging from 1 =
strongly disagree to 9 = strongly agree), whether they agreed
with statements indicating the project had improved the skill
category in question. Technical skill improvement is attributed
to this with a 6.9 average response (just below the 7-agree
mark); improvement in space interest received a 6.3 response
(also near the agree threshold). The response with regard to
presentation skills was less positive: a 4.8 response just below
the no-preference level. Figure 5 shows the distribution of
responses for each category. For technical skills, 84.6% of
responses were in the positive (program was impactful) range.
For space interest, 76.9% were in the positive (impactful)
range. For presentation skills, only 15.4% were in the positive
(impactful) range, whereas 53.8% were in the indifferent cat-
egory and 30.8% were in the negative (non-impactful) range.

The impact of serving as a team lead was also considered.
Four team leads were included among the 13 respondents.
All four team leads reported spending between 4 and 7.99 hr
per week on the project; only one non-lead participant spent
this much time (all of the rest spent between 1 and 3.99 hr per
week on the project). The average duration of involvement in
the project, for team leads, was slightly longer (0.8 year as
opposed to 0.7 year), the average GPA was marginally lower.
Team leads were either juniors or seniors (while non-lead
participants spanned all four undergraduate years).
Team leads, as shown in Figure 6, attributed technical skill
gains to project participation to a greater extent (7.3 vs. 6.8
average) than non-lead participants. They attributed increase
in space excitement to the project significantly less (5 vs. 7
average) and improvement in presentation skills marginally
less. As shown in Figure 7, they significantly outperformed
non-lead participants in all five categories. The most signifi-
cant outperformance was in improvement in spacecraft design
(1.0 greater average improvement), followed by presentation
comfort (0.78 average improvement) and technical skills
(0.75 average improvement). They outperformed in excite-
ment about space by 0.4 and in presentation skills by 0.3. The
level of improvement, for those showing improvement, also
was greater for team leads in each category (as shown in
Figure 7).
In addition to showing greater improvement across the
board, team leads had a greater percentage of respondents
showing improvement in four of the five categories (techni-
cal skills, design skills, presentation skills, and presentation
comfort). Non-lead participants reported a greater number of
individuals showing improvement in space excitement. This
is depicted in Figure 8.
Qualitative Results
In addition to program assessment conducted through cate-
gorical and scale-response questions, an open-ended ques-
tion was also provided to allow respondents to highlight
other areas of value to them. Of the 13 undergraduate respon-
dents, 6 included comments in response to this question. The
question was phrased as follows:
Please share with us: (a) any areas where you believe the project
may have provided you with particular benefit and/or (b) any
comments on any of the above questions and/or (c) any other
areas of benefit that you enjoyed that were not discussed.
The first highlighted leadership skills, presumably as an
area of particular benefit or an area not discussed. The sec-
ond indicated that the largest benefit that they received was
involvement in a large project and the opportunity that this
provided for them gaining experience working in teams. This
was mirrored by another respondent who also indicated a
benefit from group work. The fourth indicated that the proj-
ect was useful in "introducing" the respondent to "group-
based computer science work"; they also benefited from
learning about validation and testing activities. The fifth
indicated that the project had "opened" his or her "eyes" to

the diversity of computer science applications. This individ-
ual also commented on his or her ability to gain experience
in a particular technical skill that he or she otherwise would
not have had an opportunity to learn. Finally, the sixth
respondent indicated that the program had allowed the direct
application of material learned in his or her classes and also
expanded his or her knowledge in both these related and
other areas.
Analysis of Results
The results presented in the preceding section indicate that the
majority of the surveyed participants were upper-level under-
graduates with good GPAs (3.0 and higher). Most spent less
than 4 hr per week on the project, whereas a few spent between
4 and 8 hr per week on the project. Roughly a third of those
surveyed were team leads (there is a high level of correlation
between the 4-8 category and being a team lead). Respondents
were largely computer science majors (approximately 75%),
though electrical engineering and the non-STEM entrepre-
neurship major were also represented. This distribution was
not representative of overall participation in the project.As the
students self-selected for participation and the project occurred
largely at a single institution, the ability to generalize these
results to other projects and other institutions is limited. This
being said, the results serve to demonstrate initial successes
that serve to justify future work and assessment.
The results demonstrate improvement across all measured
categories (and anecdotally, based on free-response com-
ments, across some categories not specifically assessed).
This improvement was particularly centered in the technical
skills and spacecraft design categories, with an average
improvement of 20% of the scale in these two categories.
Strong attribution (nearly 7-agree) also existed for the tech-
nical skill category. Space excitement and presentation skills
and comfort also showed improvement (between 10% and
15% of the scale range); however, the attribution for the pre-
sentation skills category was not strong. The level of benefit
enjoyed by team leads was shown to be significantly greater
than for non-lead participants: In two categories, the average
level of improvement shown for those who improved was
double (or greater than double) that of non-lead participants.
In other categories, it was also significantly greater.
Conclusions and Future Work
This article has demonstrated the efficacy of using a small
spacecraft development program to facilitate undergraduate
education, for a limited number of undergraduate student
participants in the OpenOrbiter program. The results pre-
sented cover the first academic year of OpenOrbiter opera-
tions, following a thematically related predecessor program
(which operated for approximately 6 months). It has been
shown that participation in this program is generally effec-
tive and that team leads enjoy greater levels of benefit than
non-lead participants. The extrapolation to other small space-
craft programs is limited due to programmatic differences
and the small number of individuals sampled in this work.
Future work will include the completion of the OPEN designs
and their implementation. Assessment activities are planned
to continue (and be augmented) during this time and be
extended to assess the benefits to students in multiple small
spacecraft development programs.
