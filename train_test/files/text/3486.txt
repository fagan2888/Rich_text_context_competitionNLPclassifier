Beyond journalism: Theorizing
the transformation of
journalism

Abstract
Journalism has enjoyed a rich and relatively stable history of professionalization.
Scholars coming from a variety of disciplines have theorized this history, forming a
consistent body of knowledge codified in national and international handbooks and
canonical readers. However, recent work and analysis suggest that the supposed core
of journalism and the assumed consistency of the inner workings of news organizations
are problematic starting points for journalism studies. In this article, we challenge the
consensual (self-)presentation of journalism ­ in terms of its occupational ideology, its
professional culture, and its sedimentation in routines and organizational structures (cf.
the newsroom) in the context of its reconfiguration as a post-industrial, entrepreneurial,
and atypical way of working and of being at work. We outline a way beyond individualist
or institutional approaches to do justice to the current complex transformation of
the profession. We propose a framework to bring together these approaches in a
dialectic attempt to move through and beyond journalism as it has traditionally been
conceptualized and practiced, allowing for a broader definition and understanding of the
myriad of practices that make up journalism.

Introducing journalism and journalism studies
Journalism, as a profession, has enjoyed a long and stable development in most countries
around the world. Whether working under conditions of censorship, pressures of nation
building, or with expectations of providing a society with social cement, journalism is
widely recognized and seen as a set of values, principles, and practices enacted in differ-
ent ways and settings with a `sense of wholenessness and seamlessness' (Hallin, 1992:
14) around the world. Similarly, the field of journalism studies ­ the scholarly pursuit of
knowledge about journalism ­ developed alongside its object into an increasingly sophis-
ticated and consensual body of knowledge, range of research methodologies, and theo-
retical developments.
This modernist dream of coherence and consensus is a fallacy. In the late or, with
Zygmunt Bauman (Deuze, 2007a), liquid modern era, the field of journalism studies and
education recognizes how journalism is more than a neat sum of its parts, instead accom-
modating a more dynamic and indeed unruly consideration of the profession. Journalism is
transitioning from a more or less coherent industry to a highly varied and diverse range of
practices.AsAnderson et al. (2012) write in a review of the profession at the start of the 21st
century, `the journalism industry is dead but ... journalism exists in many places'(p. 76).
Scholars and educators tend to respond to this shift in two ways. One is to rally the
troops, close ranks, and put significant effort in bringing coherence and stability (back)
to the field. This gets established by producing impressive handbooks, canonical anthol-
ogies, readers, and companion volumes (and corresponding special issues of scholarly
journals and conferences). Empirical approaches in this tradition center on comprehen-
sive surveys and content analyses of journalists and journalism based on narrow defini-
tions of the news industry offering conclusions about what journalism does and who
journalists are (see Hanitzsch et al., 2011; Hellmueller and Mellado, 2015; Willnat et al.,
2013).1
A second trend in the field is to dive, head first, into the chaos. This proves to be an
often exciting and bewildering experience, leading to a wide variety of studies and con-
ceptualizations of journalism in a post-industrial era, often featuring particularistic work
on emerging genres, formats, and types of journalism. Theoretically, journalism research
in this context enthusiastically explores the boundaries of the field (Carlson and Lewis,
2015) or shows through a surge in ethnographic fieldwork how even the traditional
`inside' of the profession ­ the newsroom ­ is not as coherent as it is generally made out
to be (Domingo and Paterson, 2011).
In this intervention, we bring together these approaches in a dialectic attempt to move
beyond journalism, allowing for a broader definition and understanding of the field. We
critically interrogate first the normative expectations of what journalism should be and
do according to dominant conceptualizations of the profession. Next, epistemologically
we follow up on the newsroom-centricity of journalism studies (section `Toward a
dynamic definition of journalism') while recognizing that newsrooms continue to be
important anchoring points for newswork (section `Understanding news as work').
However, the newsroom is not necessarily a solid or coherent entity in today's post-
industrial journalism (section `Considering the organization of post-industrial journal-
ism'), nor is newswork outside of the newsroom necessarily free of the constraints and
Deuze and Witschge 167
structures traditionally provided by the institutional arrangement of journalism (section
`Enter entrepreneurialism'). Newsrooms and newswork are part of a profession that can
best be seen as a self-organizing social system through which shifting coalitions of par-
ticipants are linked, and that is interdependent on a variety of other systems (such as
sales, marketing, design, programming and coding, publishing, and distribution ser-
vices). It is also a field with a distinct materiality of praxis (Sartre, 1976: 79) ­ as what
journalism is and what journalists do cannot be meaningfully separated from their mate-
rial context (cf. technologies, work environments). We discuss how, in this context, we
can understand the role of the media professional as an enterprising individual beyond
the limited conceptualization of entrepreneurship as a strictly economic endeavor (sec-
tion `Beyond journalism'). In the concluding section, we push for an ontology of journal-
ism beyond individuals and institutions.
Defining journalism: Beyond the core­periphery dichotomy
Students and scholars coming from a wide variety of disciplines have researched and
theorized journalism, resulting in a more or less coherent conceptualization of what jour-
nalism is (Zelizer, 2004). The general approach to understanding, studying, teaching, and
practicing journalism articulates the profession with a specific occupational ideology and
culture. Journalists tend to benchmark their actions and attitudes self-referentially using
ideal-typical standards, seeing themselves as providing a public service; being objective,
fair, and (therefore) trustworthy; working autonomously, committed to an operational
logic of actuality and speed (preeminent in concepts such as reporting on breaking news,
getting the story first); and having a social responsibility and ethical sensibility (Deuze,
2005). This conceptualization is still strong within the field today and seems to endure
even in the midst of profound changes and challenges to the profession.
Through the occupational ideology of journalism, we can define the field from the
inside out, helping us to understand how the profession makes sense of itself. External
definitions of journalism tend to be more functional and instrumental, where the profes-
sion is considered to provide a particular function for (democratic) society, `informing
citizens in a way that enables them to act as citizens' (Costera Meijer, 2001: 13). Seen
from such a function-specific perspective, journalism gets identified distinct from other
media professions (such as public relations) `as a societal system providing society with
fact-based, relevant and current information' (Görke and Scholl, 2007: 651). Beyond sys-
tems theory ­ with its reluctance to be normative about what journalism could or should
be ­ democratic theories of the profession attribute it a seminal status, as Michael
Schudson (2003), for example, defines `journalism [a]s the business or practice of produc-
ing and disseminating information about contemporary affairs of general public interest
and importance' (p. 11). Schudson (2008) sees journalism in terms of what it `can do for
democracy'(p. 11), where journalism informs, investigates, analyzes, mobilizes, provides
multiple perspectives and a public forum, and publicizes representative democracy.
From this point of departure, the literature diverges, one strand embracing universalist
notions of journalism, showing how it gives meaning to itself in its culture ­ where cul-
ture is seen as the way in which a particular group (i.e. journalists working at a specific
project or within a particular context, such as a newsroom, a medium, a country or
168 Journalism 19(2)
region) works and how group members make sense of this. Thomas Hanitzsch (2007)
defines this `universal' culture of journalism as constituted by its institutional role in
society, its epistemology, and its ethical ideology. Surveys of (and interviews with) jour-
nalists, almost always sampled from within legacy news organizations, fuel such claims
by asking journalists a set of standardized questions about role perceptions and profes-
sional values. They suggest consensus and add coherence to a `global' journalism that is
as aspirational as it is universal among working journalists (Löffelholz and Weaver,
2008; Weaver and Willnat, 2012).
While popular, there is also much critical debate both among newsworkers and jour-
nalism students and scholars about an assumed homogeneity of the profession. The dis-
cussion on the elements of journalism (Kovach and Rosenstiel, 2014) tends to assume a
more or less stable core of news values and professional standards. This is a problematic
assumption in the case of journalism, as the reference to a consensual core (of `ele-
ments') excludes marginalized and minority voices, practices, and forms of journalism.
Generally lacking formal boundaries and therefore relying on communication about
itself to define and validate its privileged position in society, journalism recently has
been reconceptualized in terms of its continuous boundary work, consisting of `efforts to
establish and enlarge the limits of one domain's institutional authority relative to outsid-
ers, thus creating social boundaries that yield greater cultural and material resources for
insiders' (Lewis, 2012: 841). Research among journalists working for organizations,
companies, or units both within mainstream news media and those on the sidelines shows
how they engage repeatedly in boundary work, intensely debating what journalism is and
who can be considered to be a (`real') journalist ­ and that such discussions have always
been intrinsic to the profession and its associated praxis (Carlson and Lewis, 2015).
Even journalism's assumed significance for the functioning of democracies has come
under serious scrutiny. Beate Josephi (2013) argues that such a corollary is `too limiting
and distorting a lens through which journalism can be viewed in the 21st century' (p.
445). The consolidation of journalism studies in the literature mainly serves the modern
project of bringing an inherently unruly object under control (Steensen and Ahva, 2015:
3). It is crucial to recognize that the supposed core of journalism as well as the assumed
consistency of the inner workings of news organizations is anything but consensual, nor
is it necessarily the norm. At the same time, it would be a mistake to assume that the
types of journalism emerging outside and alongside legacy news organizations are nec-
essarily different or oppositional to the core values, ideals, and practices of the profes-
sion.Weproposeto widenjournalisticconceptualizationsbeyondthefalsecore­periphery
dichotomy, understanding that the core is no more homogeneous than the so-called
periphery, while neither necessarily represents the other's antithesis.
We have to revisit the question of what journalism is for conceptual considerations ­
the normative construction of journalism through ideology and culture as reinforced in
both scholarly work and professional publications ­ and practical propriety ­ given the
increasingly fragmented, networked, and atypical nature of the labor market for news-
work. When answering this question, theory needs to move beyond the limitations fram-
ing this discussion: An overreliance on journalism as an inherently stable institution,
distinct from other social systems, and beyond its validation as uniquely necessary for
democracy. These notions, however important, have over-extended their shelf life
Deuze and Witschge 169
(Zelizer, 2013). We argue for theorizing journalism from the ground up ­ focusing on
where, how, by whom, and why `the lost labour of reporting' (Compton and Benedetti,
2010: 487) is done.
Toward a dynamic definition of journalism
Until recently, the participation of journalists in the discursive construction of journalism
was governed by being employed in (or as a student, intern, or scholar: Observing) a
newsroom. The newsroom was the dominant form of employment and organization of
work in journalism throughout the 20th century. This arrangement served to stabilize the
industry, going hand in hand with the shaping of consensual practices in journalism stud-
ies and education. The newsroom was the site to be a journalist, to be recognized as such,
and scholars validated this process by pursuing empirical approaches dedicated to news-
rooms and the newswork therein. Throughout the history of journalism studies, high-
profile and much-cited newsroom studies have appeared, from David Manning-White's
(1950) work on the gatekeeping selections at a metropolitan newspaper via seminal work
by Jeremy Tunstall (1971) and Gaye Tuchman (1978) to more recent newsroom studies
by David Ryfe (2012) and Nikki Usher (2014), to name but a few.
Even though these studies have been important in shedding light onto newsrooms,
they focus on `problematic sites of fieldwork as well', as Anderson (2011: 152) notes.
Anderson points out that the traditional newsrooms `cannot serve as our only model for
fieldwork' as `the very definition of journalism is being contested on a daily basis'
(Anderson, 2011). This is not simply an operational problem in the current climate of
newswork destabilization. Our critique is more fundamental: Throughout its history,
scholars of journalism and the news have supported the dominance of certain interpreta-
tions of (the role of) journalism by focusing on specific institutional arrangements within
particular privileged settings. As Karin Wahl-Jorgensen (2009) puts it, the newsroom-
centricity in journalism studies has meant that
scholars have tended to focus on journalists' culture as it emerges within the limited areas of
newsrooms and other centralized sites for news production, usually paying scant attention to
places, spaces, practices and people at the margins of this spatially delimited news production
universe. (p. 23)
Such newsroom-centricity has implications beyond the mere privileging of some
actors and exclusion of others: It has also led to an emphasis on `routinized and con-
trolled forms and aspects of newswork'(Karin Wahl-Jorgensen, 2009: 25). The scholarly
consensus on professional routines that make up newswork in newsrooms has been con-
solidated in journalism education where such routines become fixed elements in the
coursework for print, broadcast, and online sequences. Cottle (2007) notes how such a
focus on `organizational functionalism' (p. 10) privileges routines and patterned ways of
doing newswork over differentiation and divergence. What is more, even within news-
room-centered research, scholars have privileged print over other media, further limiting
the range of understanding and definition of journalism. Moreover, the scholarly focus
on elite, prestige, and glamorous institutions located in large cities of the capitalist
170 Journalism 19(2)
Western world serves to solidify such places as the only ones deemed worthy of a voice
to articulate what is journalism and who counts as a journalist (Nerone, 2013).
As much of newsgathering, editing, and packaging take place elsewhere, outside of
the newsroom, and with organizations virtualizing their workflow delegating work to
stringers and correspondents on the road, Wahl-Jorgensen (2009) notes how the news-
room is disappearing. Anderson (2011) advocates `blowing up the newsroom'when con-
ducting contemporary newswork studies, proposing an approach that would consider
news production as a network that transcends organizational boundaries. And yet,
Anderson (2011) concludes, `The newsroom is not extinct. In many ways, it is more
important than ever, for it remains, even now, a central locus in which a variety of frag-
mented actor-networks find themselves tied together to create an occupation' (p. 160).
It is a challenge to consider journalism as a networked practice (Russell, 2015)
involving a distributed variety of actors and actants (including co-creating audiences as
well as robots producing news), including an emerging global startup scene of news-
work (Küng, 2015) while recognizing the permanence of meaning-giving structures,
such as the newsroom. The more or less formal (and professional) arrangement of jour-
nalism requires an awareness of the inhabited nature (Hallett and Ventresca, 2006) of
the spaces where newswork takes place. The newsroom as an inhabited institution, on
one hand, provides the raw materials and guidelines for the way people work, and on the
other hand, the various people moving in and out of the newsroom through their interac-
tions produce the institution, putting it into motion. The focus in this conceptualization
of newswork is on `institutional complexity' (Delbridge and Edwards, 2013: 927) and
heterogeneous understandings of occupational membership (Bechky, 2011: 1157). The
point is not to say that contemporary news institutions are inhabited, and those in the
past were not. As Matt Carlson suggests, journalism has always already been `a varied
cultural practice embedded within a complicated social landscape. Journalism is not a
solid, stable thing to point to, but a constantly shifting denotation applied differently
depending on context' (Carlson, 2015: 2).
The roles of institutions in newswork are dynamic and changing, opening our eyes to
movement rather than stability, to what journalism becomes rather than what journalism
is (Deuze and Witschge, 2016).
Understanding news as work
If we assume for a moment that in some ways the newsroom is still important and key to
understanding what contemporary journalism is, what would we in fact see inside one
located in a legacy media organization? For one, we would observe a lot of empty chairs.
The number of layoffs in journalism ­ especially in print ­ has been nothing but astound-
ing over the last decade. Reports of journalism unions and associations, such as the
Media, Entertainment &ArtsAlliance inAustralia, the Society of Professional Journalists
in the United States, the National Association of Journalists in The Netherlands, and the
National Union of Journalists in the United Kingdom in recent years, suggest their mem-
bers see their colleagues being fired and not replaced, as journalists working in news-
rooms consistently report having to do more with fewer colleagues and less resources.
Long-term planning and `moving up the ladder' have been replaced by job-hopping and
Deuze and Witschge 171
a portfolio work life as news professionals increasingly have contracts, not careers in
journalism. As a consequence, stress and burnout are on the rise among newsworkers,
with many journalists considering to leave the profession altogether (O'Donnell et al.,
2015; Reinardy, 2011). Precarity and a `culture of job insecurity' (Ekdale et al., 2015)
have come to define the lived experience for many inside the contemporary newsroom.
Of the people who are left in the newsroom proper, some still enjoy permanent
employment (including benefits and protections). These, generally senior, staffers
work side by side with a host of colleagues in part-time, contract, freelance, temporary,
casual, and at times underpaid or unpaid roles: Practitioners who come in irregularly
to file stories, produce segments, push stories online, or provide other editorial ser-
vices (Cohen, 2015: 515). Not only are these contractual working arrangements of
newsroom colleagues under-represented in discussions of the profession (about itself)
and, subsequently, in surveys and ethnographies of news organizations, but also the
myriad of additional functions in the newsroom ranging from technical support staff,
copy editors, ombudsmen and reader representatives, designers, producers, and pro-
grammers are often left out of the conversation. In recent years, however, such func-
tions have multiplied in the newsroom with the emergence of new roles and positions,
and they are increasingly important in shaping the practice, output, and distribution of
journalism (Bakker, 2014).
Permanent jobs are scarce, and generally unpaid internships and other forms of free or
underpaid labor now determine access ­ as in other cultural industries (Hesmondhalgh
and Baker, 2011). All this is accompanied by rising cost of entry into journalism: A trade
school diploma is a bare minimum ­ for jobs in the (national) quality news media, in
practice a high-level university education is required. Student grants have been cut, their
duration shortened, or they have been converted into loans. The majority of newcomers
in the profession start as a self-employed journalist. Tariffs for freelancer journalists
have declined over the past decade. To use The Netherlands as a particular example, not
only has freelance remuneration declined (up to 50% for news photographers), but also
almost half of Dutch freelance journalists today depend on the income of their partner,
and 60
percent have monthly earnings well below the minimum wage (Vinken and
IJdens, 2013). Given the stable market and state-subsidized media system of The
Netherlands, we would venture that this situation is the same, if not more precarious for
professionals in other developed nations.
We need to consider how changes in the way in which newswork is organized do not
only affect news as an institution but also impact individual careers. Peterson and Anand
(2004) suggested that careers in this fragmenting and flexibilizing industry tend to fol-
low two different paths. The first is a top-down career, largely established through life-
long participation in vertically structured institutions, where seniority, experience, and a
transparent system of salaries guide the professional toward higher positions in the office
hierarchy, resulting in more or less permanent positions within the newsroom. In more
competitive environments where the organization of work is tailored toward flexible
production, `careers tend to be chaotic and foster cultural innovation, and career-building
market-sensing entrepreneurs enact careers from the "bottom up" by starting from the
margins of existing professions and conventions' (p. 317). Today, a third trajectory can
be added: The `patchwork-career' (Michel, 2000) of the atypically employed individual
172 Journalism 19(2)
finding his or her permanence in impermanence, forever flexibilized on the outside as
well as on the inside of news institutions.
Newsrooms are still creating positions, yet often these are temporary structures
designed as more or less informal internships, often with little or no pay. Moreover, the
new jobs that are available in journalism tend to be in the digital area and in numbers do
not make up for layoffs elsewhere in organizations (Deuze and Fortunati, 2010). With the
accelerating dynamic of reorganizations and reshuffling, buyouts and layoffs, new own-
ers and managers, new work arrangements and budget cuts, journalism has become more
precarious and less accessible to everyone. In fact, if we put it provocatively, it increas-
ingly seems to be the playing field of only those who can afford to work for years or even
for the majority of their careers below or around the minimum wage in the largest and
therefore most expensive cities, as that is where the main news outfits (as well as most
hyperlocal companies and news startups) are generally located.
Although exclusivity of industry access is not new, it tends to be overlooked. This
critique of journalism studies'tendency to overlook the dimensions of labor and working
conditions as these influence the news is not particular to journalism studies but can be
made about most media studies. In fact, only in recent years has labor enjoyed a surge in
scholarly attention across media, cultural, and creative industries (Banks et al., 2013;
Deuze, 2007b; Hesmondhalgh and Baker, 2011). Incorporating work into media studies
allows us to address the diversity in roles, functions, and people's backgrounds that
exists in media work generally and newswork in particular (Siegelbaum and Thomas,
2016), providing insight into how professional journalism has diversified into many dif-
ferent forms of reporting and newsgathering, production, and distribution.
Considering the organization of post-industrial journalism
According to Anderson et al. (2012), journalism is evolving toward a `post-industrial'
model of news. They argue that in order for journalism to adapt to the new media envi-
ronment (with its attendant social, economic, and cultural implications), the profession
needs new tactics, a new self-conception, and new organizational structures. What their
report alludes to is a trend benchmarked by developments across the creative industries
more generally: A gradual shift from centralized and hierarchical modes of industrial
production to what Castells (2010) coined as a `network enterprise' form of production.
The relationships of capital and labor in our at once global and local network society,
argues Castells, are increasingly individualized. This type of post-industrial mode of
production integrates the work process globally through digital telecommunications,
transportation, and client­customer networks. Workers find themselves collaborating or
coordinating their activities with professionals elsewhere, sometimes located in different
parts of the world. Furthermore, newswork increasingly takes place with the formal or
informal collaboration of the public, who participate on a co-creative continuum ranging
from sharing real-time information all the way to authoring autonomous news stories,
shaping an emerging type of networked journalism (Beckett, 2010).
Considering the role of journalism in an always online environment, Van Der Haak
et al. (2012) see the emergence of a new professional figure: The `networked journalist',
whose work is `driven by a networked practice dependent on sources, commentaries, and
Deuze and Witschge 173
feedback, some of which are constantly accessible online' (p. 2927). They consider this
new role for journalists `not a threat to the independence and quality of professional
journalism, but a liberation from strict corporate control' (Van Der Haak et al., 2012:
2935). The networked character of newswork gets amplified by a particular feature of the
corporate character of the global news industry: The often translocalized nature of the
media production process, as media industries cross-finance, offshore, subcontract, and
outsource various elements in the production process to save costs and redistribute risks.
In journalism, outsourcing is called `remote control journalism' as news organizations
move specializations or entire divisions to another part of the world (Compton and
Benedetti, 2010: 495; Mosco, 2009: 350­351), while `journalism-by-remote-control'
refers to the increased reliance of legacy news organizations on local contacts, handlers,
stringers, and correspondents in (conflict) areas around the world (rather than sending
contracted employees).2
Like media work elsewhere, post-industrial newswork still tends to take place not
only in the offices and on the work floors of specific institutions ­ including newsrooms
­ but also at home, the atelier-style offices of editorial collectives and journalism start-
ups, and in free Wi-Fi café environments as the landscape of urban media production
(Hartmann, 2009). As much of this work is contingent, freelance, and temporary, people
constantly move in and out of such environments, continuously reconstituting the pro-
duction process. Furthermore, under conditions of a changing media culture that is more
interactive and co-creative (Jenkins, 2006), media professionals as well as their audi-
ences are increasingly (expected to be) working together, to converse and co-create. This
process accelerates the flow of people, processes, and ideas through the networked enter-
prise that journalism becomes (Heinrich, 2011).
Considering the individualized precarious and networked context of newswork, it
becomes imperative to critically interrogate the notion of `organization' as the opera-
tional framework for analyzing what it is like to do journalism and be a journalist. The
emphasis in studies of contemporary organizations has been shifting from explaining the
behavior of the organization as a macro-structural entity to embracing organizations as
open systems of interdependent activities, linking shifting coalitions of participants in
intra- and interorganizational networks (Baker and Faulkner, 2005). In this light, Gernot
Grabher (2002) suggests we shift our focus from the media firm as a generally unprob-
lematized coherent and unitary economic actor to organizational practices that are built
around projects, involving a project ecology of shifting alliances (or teams) of people
from inside and outside the company.
Looking at temporary projects and collaborations enables us to focus on organizations
as loosely integrated units of individuals working together ­ possibly including partici-
pants from different disciplines, with different working arrangements, and with different
professional identities, along with collaborating publics. This allows for the equally nec-
essary acknowledgment that still much of the work in the media gets done within the
context of observable organizational structures and arrangements. Developments in
online production and digital communication, production, and distribution technologies
have facilitated the proliferation of many smaller companies and networks able to pro-
vide specialized and niche services to the generally more rigid and bureaucratically
structured regional, national, and multinational media businesses (Deuze, 2007b:
174 Journalism 19(2)
87­88). In order to make the transition toward a more flexible type of production, media
companies in recent years have tended to reorganize themselves into multiple smaller
units or have shifted toward a more decentralized, team-based managerial and working
style ­ attempting to flatten existing hierarchies in the company or to bypass journalism's
obduracy ­ a general resistance to change produced by `routines, practices, and values,
developed over time' (Borger et al., 2013: 50).
A specific example of a new managerial style in the organization of newswork is the
introduction of agile development sequences in renowned news companies, such as the
Washington Post, NPR, Politiken, and the BBC (Marshall, 2012). `Agile' refers to a set
of management principles commonly used in software development, and in the context
of news production stipulates fast-paced projects with short design cycles, working in
temporary teams based on the integration of people from different parts of the company
­ reporters, assignment editors, designers, developers, market research, and manage-
ment. We have little empirical knowledge of these types of work in the field of journal-
ism studies, but findings from organization studies (within creative industries generally)
suggest that within many of these conglomerates, the sharing of knowledge or cross-
fertilization of ideas and projects is in fact quite minimal and tends not so much to
depend on structural intra-firm relationships (in business jargon, `synergies'), but rather
on personal, informal, and affective personal networks (Grabher and Ibert, 2006). Such
networks stretch both across and outside of institutional boundaries, consisting of profes-
sionals in different fields of work and working under different contractual (if contracted
at all) arrangements.
A second key example of the diversified managerial strategy deployed inside news
organizations correlates with the signaled emergence of a global startup culture in jour-
nalism, as venerable news companies create separate divisions or units to act and func-
tion as startups (Küng, 2015). These project units tend to have separate budgets, often
consist of members from across (and outside of) the company, and are generally encour-
aged to adopt a unique, more or less independent work style. Their function is as much
to inspire the news company as a whole to adopt more flexible ways of working as it is
to develop new sources of revenue and audience attention.
Enter entrepreneurialism
This picture of increasingly networked and precarious working conditions for journalists
and media workers corresponds with trends in the labor market as a whole, showing a
continuous growth of independent businesses and freelance entrepreneurship.3 At the
same time, news organizations have seen major budget cuts, reorganizations, and consid-
erable downsizing. Responding to technological disruption (Witschge, 2012b) and
changing audience behaviors (Witschge, 2012a), production practices change. Managers
and employers have come to stress the importance of `enterprise' as an individual rather
than organizational or firm-based attribute (Du Gay, 1996), in effect forcing entrepre-
neurialism on employees and freelancers alike (Oakley, 2014). The notion of the enter-
prising or entrepreneurial individual extends beyond the creative industries, but the
emergence of the enterprising professional in journalism is a relatively recent phenom-
enon, coinciding with a gradual breakdown of the wall between the commercial and
Deuze and Witschge 175
editorial sides of the news organization, following `a process of further commodification
of a commercialized media workplace where market pressures are increasingly dominat-
ing content decisions' (Von Rimscha, 2015).
Faced with difficult and disruptive challenges on many fronts, the news business
demands its workers to increasingly shoulder the responsibility of the company (or com-
panies, in the case of those with patchwork careers, carrying a portfolio of multiple cli-
ents; see Platman, 2004). Trends such as the integration of the business and editorial
sides of the news organization; the ongoing convergence of print, broadcasting, and
online news divisions into digital-first and mobile-first journalism enterprises; and the
introduction of projectized work styles (such as agile development) show that such
hybridized working practices are not particular to freelance journalists (Compton and
Benedetti, 2010).
Shifting the notion of enterprise ­ with its connotations of efficiency, productivity,
empowerment, and autonomy ­ from the company to the individual, it is suggested to be
part of the professional identity of each and every worker, contingently employed or not.
This shift reconstitutes `workers as more adaptable, flexible, and willing to move
between activities and assignments and to take responsibility for their own actions and
their successes and failures' (Storey et al., 2005: 1036). In this enterprising economy,
entrepreneurial journalists increasingly start their own companies ­ somewhat similar to
their colleagues elsewhere in the creative sector starting boutique advertising agencies or
independent record labels, forming editorial or reportorial collectives as well as business
startups. The emergence of a startup culture is indeed global: Since the early years of the
21st century, new independent (and generally small-scale and online-only) journalism
companies have formed around the world (Bruno and Kleis Nielsen, 2012; Coates Nee,
2014; Küng, 2015; Simons, 2013).4
This shift in focus to entrepreneurialism has not only taken place within the industry.
Researchers and educators have matched this attention with scholarly work and curricular
innovation, which further urges journalists to take on entrepreneurialism as a core element
in their identity (for a critical take, see Anderson, 2014). Courses and degrees in entrepre-
neurial journalism have been developed in countries as varied as the United States, the
United Kingdom, Canada, France, Colombia, Mexico, and The Netherlands (Mensing
and Ryfe, 2013; Van Der Kamp et al., 2014; Vazquez Schaich and Klein, 2013).
Emphasizing individual traits, skills, attitude, and mindset, this curriculum further envis-
ages the future of journalism in the form of journalists who (alone or in collaboration) are
able to monetize content in innovative ways, connect to publics in interactive new for-
mats, grasp opportunities, and respond to (and shape) its environment (Briggs, 2012).
There are a number of issues with this conceptualization of entrepreneurialism. First,
even though we can find some optimism among the independently employed, several
studies (Ertel et al., 2005; Gregg, 2011; Hesmondhalgh and Baker, 2011) consistently
show adverse psychosocial effects, rising levels of stress, and overall poor subjective
health among freelance media workers. The real or perceived freedom of working as an
`independent' comes at a cost to many. In presenting the entrepreneur as a `savior'
(Sørensen, 2008), there is too little attention for those costs.
A second, conceptual issue regarding entrepreneurship in journalism is the fact that it
is generally presented as an individual-level attribute, which tends to reinforce a `you are
176 Journalism 19(2)
on your own' credo of individualized patchwork career trajectories. Entrepreneurship is
thus presented as micro-level agency to make something happen, while the structural,
unequal, and often arbitrary conditions underlying production processes do not get
addressed (Görling and Rehn, 2008). As Landström and Johannisson (2001) explicate,
`entrepreneurship [is] a phenomenon that lies beyond individual attributes and abilities.
Entrepreneurship encompasses ... the organising of resources and collaborators in new
patterns according to perceived opportunities' (p. 228). It is imperative to understand
entrepreneurial journalism in terms of both formal and informal networks, teams, and
associations that tend to transcend the boundaries of news organizations large and small.
Beyond journalism
In this precarious setting ­ where newsrooms become networks of loosely affiliated
competitor-colleagues, news organizations retool toward an enterprising mode of pro-
duction, access to the profession is increasingly exclusive, and individual journalists are
held responsible for market success (and failure)­ to be a professional, working journal-
ist means having to go and perform beyond journalism.5 Working in this environment
demands journalists today to be committed well beyond what any profession could ask
for ­ without most of the securities, comforts, and benefits enjoyed by being a member
of a profession. Journalists are expected to reskill, deskill, and upskill their practices and
working routines, generally without any direct say in the way the organizations they
engage with operate. In doing so, they vulnerably move inside and outside of newsrooms
and news organizations large and small, trying to both make a difference and to make
ends meet in an exceedingly competitive market. In this context, understanding journal-
ism means to appreciate journalists' personal drive beyond the institutional protections
and privileges of the profession. In today's post-industrial journalism, the affective and
at times passionate engagement with newswork is expected in a profoundly precarious
context and as such asks for rearticulation. However, there is a remarkable lack of atten-
tion for the affective and social dimensions of newswork in journalism studies and edu-
cation (Beckett and Deuze, 2016).
Under conditions of technology and the market, the practice of journalism is (and
always has been) often something quite different than its biased self-presentation and the
way dominant conceptualizations of the field get articulated in journalism education and
research. Conceptually as well as practically, journalism ­ seen as the process and prod-
uct of the work of journalists ­ requires an ontology of becoming rather than of being
(Chia, 1995). Following Robert Chia (1995), we propose a perspective on journalism as
a profession, a set of institutional practices, a system of education, as well as a theoretical
concept which privileges `reality as a processual, heterogeneous and emergent configu-
ration of relations' (p. 594).
As a growing number of scholars in various fields argue, in order to understand what
a media profession such as journalism is becoming and what working as a journalist is
like, we need to broaden the focus of journalism studies. Widening our view is not just a
mere expansion of our sample: We need to reconsider our understanding of the role of
both organizations (beyond the stable news institutions) and individuals (beyond the
entrepreneur as savior of journalism), as well as the notion of the audience (beyond the
Deuze and Witschge 177
more or less avid consumer of news). Journalism takes place in increasingly networked
settings, in formal as well as informal contexts, involving a wide range of actors and act-
ants in various instances of both paid and free labor (Fast et al., 2016), covering news in
real-time across multiplying platforms, often in competition or collaboration with pub-
lics (Witschge, 2012b). Such an `ambient' (Hermida, 2010) and `liquid' (Deuze, 2008)
conception of journalism requires a toolkit that looks at the field as a moving object and
as a dynamic set of practices and expectations ­ a profession in a permanent process of
becoming.
`Beyond journalism'is an approach to journalism that considers it as a dynamic object
of study. It points at the permanent instability inside the news industry as well as the
structural and structured nature of people committing acts of journalism outside of it.
Beyond journalism does not only exclude a `hard' definition of the profession as a rela-
tively contained entity with distinct boundaries but also a `soft' definition of a range of
practices by a multitude of actors that in various ways contribute to its social relevance.
Beyond journalism is, as we have hoped to have shown in this article, not a new concep-
tualization of the field ­ it is also not simply advocating scholars and students alike to
denounce existing definitions of what we understand newswork to be. Rather, it has
argued that going beyond boundaries is what is productive in this time of flux. In recog-
nizing this theoretical point, we would in fact ground our work more solidly in the lived
experience of journalists and doing journalism.
