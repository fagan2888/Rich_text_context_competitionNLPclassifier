Abstract: Male height is associated with high mate value. In particular, tall men are
perceived as more attractive, dominant and of a higher status than shorter rivals, resulting
in a greater lifetime reproductive success. Female infidelity and relationship dissolution
may therefore present a greater risk to short men. It was predicted that tall men would
report greater relationship satisfaction and lower jealousy and mate retention behavior than
short men. Ninety eight heterosexual men in a current romantic relationship completed a
questionnaire. Both linear and quadratic relationships were found between male height and
relationship satisfaction, cognitive and behavioral jealousy. Tall men reported greater
relationship satisfaction and lower levels of cognitive or behavioral jealousy than short
men. In addition, linear and quadratic relationships were found between male height and a
number of mate retention behaviors. Tall and short men engaged in different mate retention
behaviors. These findings are consistent with previous research conducted in this area
detailing the greater attractiveness of tall men.

Introduction
Previous research has outlined the female preference for tall partners and the extent
to which this impacts on a range of mating behavior. We will examine whether tall men are
more satisfied with their relationship, less prone to jealousy and whether male height is
associated with the use of mate retention behaviors.
Male height, quality, and attractiveness
Male height provides a clear indication of mate quality and health (Silventoinen,
Lahelma, and Rahkonen, 1999), with only high quality men able to allocate the resources
required to develop their stature. In addition, research has demonstrated that male height is
associated with established indicators of genetic quality such as fluctuating asymmetry
Height, satisfaction, jealousy, retention
(Manning, 1995) and self-reported physical health (Samaras and Elrick, 1999). Height may
also indicate a man's status relative to other men, for example tall men are perceived as
more dominant and assertive than shorter men (Melamed, 1992). In part, this perception
may reflect the fact that the higher levels of testosterone associated with male height (Heald
et al., 2003) also results in other observable features associated with dominance such as a
prominent jaw and brow ridge (Enlow, 1990). Male stature may also signal the possession
of desirable non physical qualities. For example, male height is associated with
socioeconomic status and access to resources (Judge and Cable, 2004; Peck and Lundberg,
1995; Silventoinen et al., 1999).
As a consequence of the physical and non-physical qualities associated with male
stature, tall men experience a number of reproductive advantages. Stature is an important
element of male attractiveness (Pawlowski and Koziel, 2002) and women are most
attracted to tall men (Kurzban and Weeden, 2002; Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005). In fact
both men and women (at least in Western post-industrial societies) report a desire for
relationships in which the man is taller (Gillis and Avis, 1980). Consequently, tall men
receive more responses to `lonely hearts' column advertisements (Lynn and Shurgot, 1984)
and women report dating tall men more frequently than short men (Shepperd and
Strathman, 1989). The average number of dates for men one standard deviation above the
mean was twice that of men one standard deviation below the mean. Tall men also obtain
more attractive partners (Feingold, 1982) are less likely to be childless (Nettle, 2002) and
have a greater number of children (Mueller and Mazur, 2001) than their shorter rivals. The
increased reproductive success of tall men may reflect the greater likelihood that tall men
obtain a second or subsequent wife. As height can be a cue to a man's ability to provide
protection and resources or a cue to heritable fitness (Silventoinen, Kapiro, Lahelma,
Viken, and Rose 2001; Schousboe et al., 2004) there are a number of reproductive
advantages afforded to women that select tall mates.
Cuckoldry and reproductive success
The female preference for tall partners may present an increased risk of desertion or
cuckoldry (paternity by another male) to shorter men. The mixed mating or dual strategy
hypothesis (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000) suggests that women may cuckold their long
term partner by mating with a man that has a high genetic quality (in order to produce high
quality offspring) whilst retaining the resources of their primary (lower quality) partner.
Whilst cuckoldry represents a substantial problem for all men (Baker and Bellis, 1995;
Platek and Shackelford, 2006), it may be of greater concern for short men. Women unable
to secure the most desirable (i.e. tall) partner for a long term relationship could adopt a dual
strategy, retaining the investment of a less attractive (i.e. short) man whilst engaging in
extra pair copulations with a more desirable (i.e. tall) man.
Extra pair copulations with tall men would be less beneficial for women in a long
term relationship with a tall as opposed to a short man. The relative difference between the
attractiveness of the long term and extra pair partners would be lower for these women and
the quality of the partner lost (if the extra pair copulation were discovered and
abandonment followed) would be greater. The suggestion that short men may are at most
risk of cuckoldry is supported by the finding that the female preference for tall men is
heightened when selecting a man for a short term relationship or during the fertile phase of
the menstrual cycle (Pawlowski and Koziel, 2002) and the greater jealousy of less attractive

men when their partner is most fertile (Haselton and Gangestad, 2006). This is also
consistent with other research indicating that women paired to low quality males are most
likely to seek extra-pair relationships with higher quality men (Waynforth, 1998).
In addition, short men may have greater difficulty increasing their reproductive
success through short term or extra pair matings than tall men and be most likely to restrict
their reproductive output to the level of their long term partner. The greater reliance on the
success of a long term relationship for lifetime reproductive success further highlights the
threat that cuckoldry or relationship dissolution poses for short men. This may be further
exacerbated by a greater difficulty attracting a new partner as suggested by the female
preference for tall mates (Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005). Consequently, being sensitive to
the threat that cuckoldry and desertion presents and investing in mate retention may be of
most benefit to short men.
Jealousy and mate retention
Jealousy is often perceived as a negative emotion (Buunk and Bringle, 1987) and
has been related to a range of destructive events or behaviors such as domestic violence and
marital problems (Aronson and Pines, 1980; Barnett, Martinez, and Bluestein, 1995).
Jealousy however, may serve a number of adaptive functions (Buss, 2000). The elicitation
of jealousy allows an individual to identify those individuals or circumstances that present
the greatest threat to their relationship. Importantly, the identification of a specific threat
may promote the use of mate retention behaviors intended to strengthen the pair bond or
deter rivals (Buunk, Massar, and Dijkstra, 2007). Jealousy therefore has the potential to
reduce desertion or cuckoldry and promote reproductive success if elicited by an
appropriate threat. In addition, it has been suggested that jealousy protects and promotes
love in other ways (Dugosh, 2000; Mathes, 1986; Mathes and Severa, 1981). For example,
a partner's jealousy could be interpreted as a sign of caring, promoting a belief that the
partner is committed and ready to invest in a long term relationship. Alternatively,
individuals that believe their partner is desired by others (and respond jealously to a
potential rival) may raise their perceptions of the partner's mate value or attractiveness,
increasing their attraction to their partner. The level of jealousy experienced may reflect the
level of threat. For example, men that are concerned with their partner's jealousy
experience more jealousy when the rival is attractive (Maner, Miller, Rouby, and Gailliot,
2009).
In this context, Buunk, Park, Zurriaga, Klavina and Massar (2008) demonstrate that
tall men are less jealous than short men. Specifically, tall men are less jealous than short
men when faced with the prospect of a physically attractive and dominant rival. This
research made an important contribution to the field, demonstrating that male height is
related to romantic jealousy and that these responses can be elicited in response to
hypothetical scenarios. The present study investigates the relationship between height and
jealousy further, and considers the manner in which male height is related to three jealousy
dimensions. Pfeiffer and Wong (1989) identify three jealousy dimensions: emotional
jealousy which concerns how a person responds to potentially provoking situations;
cognitive jealousy which comprises of the individual's appraisal of a situation and
behavioral jealousy which includes a range of behaviors intended to reduce a specific
threat.

Height, satisfaction, jealousy, retention
The current study and predictions
We predicted that the potential threats to lifetime reproductive success experienced
by short men (outlined above) would result in greater suspicion or concern (cognitive
jealousy), efforts to minimize the threat (behavioral jealousy) and reaction to events that
threaten the relationship (emotional jealousy). Based on their relatively high attractiveness,
increased ability to obtain high quality mates and hypothesized lower risk of cuckoldry or
desertion, we also predicted that tall men would report higher levels of relationship
satisfaction than shorter men. To explore the relationship between height and behaviors that
may minimize the risk of cuckoldry or desertion further, we considered a range of mate
retention behaviors (Buss, Shackelford and McKibbin, 2008). These included behaviors
intended to deter potential rivals and those expected to increase a partner's desire to remain
in the current relationship.
Therefore, the current study extends previous research in this area beyond initial
attraction (e.g. Pawlowski and Koziel, 2002) or reproductive success (e.g. Mueller and
Mazur, 2001) to the dynamics within a relationship. In particular, the research explores the
extent to which male height is associated with relationship satisfaction, jealousy and mate
retention.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Ninety-eight heterosexual men aged between 19 and 72 years (mean = 27.3, SD =
11.09) participated. Men were recruited from the local community (i.e. local business)
through opportunity sampling. All participants were in a romantic relationship at the time
of the study. Men's height ranged from 155cm to 196cm (mean = 178.4, SD = 8.14) and
was comparable with the UK average (Mean 175.3cm, Health Survey for England, 2007,
2009).
Procedure
Participants were presented with a questionnaire which asked a range of
autobiographical questions (age, own height). The use of self-report rather than directly
measured height is consistent with previous research (e.g. Pawlowski, 2003) and the
reliability of this method is well documented (Himes and Roche, 1982). Participants were
then asked to rate their relationship satisfaction on a 7 point Likert scale. Participants were
also asked to complete the 24 item Multidimensional Jealousy Scale (Pfeiffer and Wong,
1989), assessing cognitive (8 items), emotional (8 items) and behavioral jealousy (8 items).
Example items include `How would you emotionally react to X flirting with someone of
the opposite sex?' and `How often do you call X unexpectedly, just to see if he or she is
there?' Each subscale proved to be reliable (Cronbach's alpha: cognitive: .92; emotional:
.86 and behavioral: .90). All items relating to jealousy were completed on a 7 point Likert
scale.
Finally, participants completed the Mate Retention Inventory-Short Form (Buss,
Shackelford, and McKibbin, 2008), consisting of 38 items. Example items include "Called
to make sure my partner was where she said she would be" and "Perform sexual favors to
keep my partner around." The scale proved to be reliable (Cronbach's alpha: .88). Each
subscale of the questionnaire was also largely reliable (Cronbach's alpha: vigilance: .77;

Results
Consistent with previous research (e.g. Buunk et al., 2008), regression analyses
were used to test for linear and quadratic effects. The analyses controlled for participant
age. As shown in Table 1, significant linear and quadratic relationships were identified
between men's height and relationship satisfaction, cognitive jealousy and behavioral
jealousy. An inspection of the residuals suggests that the linear regressions provided a
closer approximation of the data. As shown in Figures 1-3, tall men reported greater
relationship satisfaction and reported lower levels of jealous cognitions or jealous behavior.
However, neither significant linear nor quadratic relationships were revealed between
men's height and emotional jealousy or overall use of mate retention strategies.

Discussion
The results indicate that male height predicts relationship satisfaction, cognitive and
behavioral jealousy and the use of various mate retention behaviors. The greater
relationship satisfaction reported by tall men is consistent with research finding that tall
men are more attractive to women (Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005) and that women would
rather be in a relationship in which the man is taller (Gillis and Avis, 1980). In order to
guard against infidelity or desertion and promote mate retention, women partnered with a
high quality mate may use a range of behaviors such as improving physical appearance to
increase their mate's satisfaction with the existing relationship (Buss, 1988). Therefore tall
men may report greater satisfaction with their relationship because their partner is more
attentive. In addition, the greater desirability of tall men is expected to provide greater

Height, satisfaction, jealousy, retention
access to attractive women. Consequently, tall men may report greater satisfaction with
their relationship because they are partnered to highly desirable women. Future research is
recommended to investigate the relative desirability and behavior of women partnered to
tall and short men.
The current study revealed that tall men are less likely to report jealousy with
respect to jealous cognitions (i.e. suspicion or concern) or behaviors (intended to minimize
the threat). This is consistent with previous research indicating that high quality men
experience the least mate oriented jealousy (Brown and Moore, 2003). Both tall and short
men are at risk of cuckoldry (Baker and Bellis, 1995; Platek and Shackelford, 2006),
however the greater desire for tall partners and heightened female preference for tall men
during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle or when selecting short term partners
(Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005) suggest that shorter men should be more alert to the risk
of their partner's infidelity or the presence of male rivals than tall men. An increased
propensity to experience jealous cognitions (suspicion) or to act on these concerns (jealous
behaviors) may be adaptive for short men, reducing the risk posed by specific threats.
These cognitions and behaviors may be less advantageous for tall men, for whom the risk
(of cuckoldry or desertion) may be lower and for whom an increased physical
attractiveness could increase the likelihood that a desirable alternative mate could be
obtained. These findings further demonstrate the manner in which evolved psychological
mechanisms (i.e. jealousy) may interact with functionally relevant individual differences
(i.e. height) to affect the expression of behavior (Schaller, Park, and Mueller, 2003).
The relationship between male height and mate retention was less uniform than
other findings which may explain the lack of association between male height and the
overall use of mate retention behaviors. The results suggest that tall men engage in
different mate retention behaviors and adopt different approaches to short men. Tall men
were more likely than short men to engage in mate retention behaviors such as vigilance or
monopolization of time. This tendency could reflect an ability to adopt undesirable
behaviors without lowering their overall mate quality. In contrast, we suggest that short
men may be reluctant to adopt these behaviors which could further reduce the
attractiveness of the relationship, already compromised by a lower mate quality. The extent
to which women's reactions to mate retention behavior is influenced by their partner's
height has not been investigated and additional research is required to explore this issue.
Shorter men were not more likely to engage in competitive behaviors such as
violence against rivals. This is perhaps understandable as tall rivals are expected to be of a
high quality (Manning, 1995; Samaras, 2007) and dominance (Melamed, 1992). Short men
consequently risk retaliation and unfavorable comparisons with a higher quality rival if
they decide to pursue these mate retention behaviors. As height is related to testosterone
levels (Heald, et al., 2003), this finding is consistent with the finding that men with a high
(2D:4D) digit ratio (indicating lower prenatal testosterone) are less likely to threaten
competitors or use threats or aggression against their partner (Cousins, Fugere, and
Franklin, 2009). In the current study, short men were most likely to adopt mate retention
behaviors such as increasing the love and care that they show their partner. In this manner
short men demonstrate that they are aware of the risk of cuckoldry but attempt to increase
the desirability of a woman's current relationship rather than adopting more risky strategies
that encourage comparisons with a rival or appear aggressive.
Male height was not related to emotional jealousy (reactions to events that threaten

Height, satisfaction, jealousy, retention
the relationship). At first, the lack of association between height and emotional jealousy
appears inconsistent with the greater cognitive and behavioral jealousy reported by short
men or the more generalized relationship between height and jealousy revealed by Buunk,
et al. (2008). Differences may reflect the focus of each subscale. The cognitive and
behavioral jealousy subscales measure the propensity to interpret situations suspiciously or
respond to that suspicion. In contrast, the emotional jealousy subscale asks participants to
consider how they would feel in a range of situations such as a partner hugging and kissing
someone of the opposite sex. In these less ambiguous situations, height does not influence
men's emotional reactions. Although there may be less incentive for tall men to interpret
ambiguous situations jealously (for example a lower likelihood that their partner would
attract a higher quality mate than for short men), when unambiguous situations occur, men
experience an emotional reaction, regardless of height. Alternatively, the results may reflect
the relatively high level of emotional (compared to cognitive or behavioral) jealousy
reported. Mean emotional jealousy was 38.26 (SD = 8.64) compared to 16.47 (SD = 9.94)
and 14.65 (SD = 7.84) for cognitive and behavioral jealousy respectively, suggesting that
men may report high levels of emotional jealousy regardless of the scenario or personal
characteristics such as height.
Future Research and Limitations
Self reported male height was obtained rather than direct measurements. The
reliability of self reported height is well documented (Himes and Roche, 1982) and the use
of self reported height is now standard practice (e.g. Pawlowski, 2003) in research of this
type. We acknowledge the limitations of this method however, and the greater accuracy
afforded by direct measurements. In particular, the positive association between male
height, attractiveness and socioeconomic status suggest that data may be systematically
biased with men artificially inflating their self reported height. Additional research
exploring this issue and establishing the reliability of self report measures is recommended.
Relationship experience was also assessed through self report questionnaires. Future
research could obtain a more detailed retrospective or longitudinal account of an
individual's relationship history including length of each relationship, relationship conflict
and termination. This description would also provide important information about the
relationship between male height and relationship behavior. The relative ease with which
high quality men can obtain extra pair partners (Waynforth, 1998) suggests that
relationships outside the primary pair bond and their impact on the pair bond should also be
considered. For example, it may be predicted that women are more likely to forgive a taller
(higher quality) partner when they are unfaithful than a lower quality short mate.
The current study focused on absolute male height. The relative height of men and
women is also important however and both men and women adjust their preference for
partner height in relation to their own height (Fink, Neave, Brewer, and Pawlowski, 2007;
Pawlowski, 2003). The relative height of a man, in relation to his partner, operationalized
as sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS: male height / female height) should also therefore be
considered in relation to relationship satisfaction, jealousy and mate retention. As with
much of the research conducted in this area, the current study investigated height in a
Western post-industrial society. Sear and Marlowe (2009) find no evidence for the male
taller norm or a relationship between male height and reproductive success in the more
traditional Hadza community. Therefore the extent to which these results can be

Height, satisfaction, jealousy, retention
generalized to non-Western cultures remains speculative and extensive cross-cultural
research is required assessing both partner preference and mating behavior.
Conclusion
To conclude, the current study finds that tall men report greater satisfaction with
their romantic relationship and are less likely to report cognitive or behavioral jealousy.
The relationship between height and mate retention is less uniform with tall and short men
reporting engaging in different mate retention behaviors. These results indicate that male
height influences not just a man's ability to acquire a suitable mate, but his behavior whilst
in the relationship and approach to mate retention. These findings compliment existing
results and suggest new areas of research such as investment in a partner and extra-pair
relationships.
