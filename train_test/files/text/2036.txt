and diabetes status are associated with arterial
pulse pressure

Abstract
Background: Diabetes is a global epidemic. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most prevalent
consequences of diabetes. Nutrition is considered a modifiable risk factor for CVD, particularly for individuals with
diabetes; albeit, there is little consensus on the role of carbohydrates, proteins and fats for arterial health for
persons with or without diabetes. In this study, we examined the association of macronutrients with arterial pulse
pressure (APP), a surrogate measure of arterial health by diabetes status and race.
Methods: Participants were 892 Mexican Americans (MA), 1059 Black, non-Hispanics (BNH) and 2473 White, non-
Hispanics (WNH) with and without diabetes of a weighted sample from the National Nutrition and Health
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008. The cross-sectional analysis was performed with IBM-SPSS version 18 with
the complex sample analysis module. The two-year sample weight for the sub-sample with laboratory values was
applied to reduce bias and approximate a nationally, representative sample. Arterial stiffness was assessed by
arterial pulse pressure (APP).
Results: APP was higher for MA [B = 0.063 (95% CI 0.015 to 0.111), p = 0.013] and BNH [B = 0.044 (95% CI 0.006 to
0.082), p = 0.018] than WNH, controlling for diabetes, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), fiber intake, energy
intake (Kcal) and smoking. A two-way interaction of diabetes by carbohydrate intake (grams) was inversely
associated with APP [B = -1.18 (95% CI -0.178 to -0.058), p = 0.001], controlling for race, age, gender, BMI, Kcal and
smoking. BNH with diabetes who consumed more mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) than WNH with diabetes
had lower APP [B = -0.112 (95%CI-0.179 to -0.045), p = 0.003] adjusting for saturated fatty acids, Kcal, age, gender,
BMI and smoking.
Conclusion: Higher MUFA and carbohydrate intake for persons with diabetes reflecting lower APP may be due to
replacement of saturated fats with CHO and MUFA. The associations of APP with diabetes, race and dietary intake
need to be confirmed with intervention and prospective studies. Confirmation of these results would suggest that
dietary interventions for minorities with diabetes may improve arterial health.
Background
The prevalence of diabetes and its health consequences
has been growing disproportionately in the U.S. and
throughout the world. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is
the most prevalent and detrimental complication of dia-
betes accounting for about 65% of deaths from heart
disease and stroke [1-3]. Death rates among adults with
diabetes were 2-4 times higher from heart disease and
about 2.8 times greater from stroke, when compared to
individuals without diabetes [4,5].
Arterial stiffening which leads to CVD is consistently
observed across all age groups for individuals with dia-
betes [6]. A complex series of structural, cellular and
hormonal changes contribute to the lack of resilience of
the vascular wall, promoting arterial stiffening [6]. A
possible link between diabetes and CVD could be due to
the pathological changes in the endothelium, at the
microvascular level that leads to the stiffening of arteries
in persons with diabetes. This stiffening reduces the

artery's ability to expand and recoil leading to a progres-
sive rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and decrease in
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [7,8]. The difference
between SBP and DBP is referred to as arterial pulse
pressure (APP). A high APP is indicative of increased
arterial stiffness that promotes further stiffening of the
arteries, and has been associated with CVD morbidity
and mortality [6,9]. Arterial pulse pressure is easily cal-
culated by the difference between systolic and diastolic
blood pressure and is a non-invasive, convenient, surro-
gate measure of arterial stiffness [10].
For epidemiological studies and clinical trials invasive
methods or the use of expensive instruments (such as
those measuring pulse wave velocity) may not be feasi-
ble; yet, measures of arterial stiffness for participants by
disease state and social characteristics serve public
health interests. Particularly since CVD is a leading
cause of death and cardiovascular risk factors such as
age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterole-
mia and smoking have been associated with increased
arterial stiffness and systemic endothelial dysfunction
[11]. Arterial pulse pressure has been correlated to
endothelial function in hypertensive patients [12] and
with pulse wave velocity and endothelial function in
healthy participants [11]. Therefore, APP may be a feasi-
ble method for screening endothelial function and arter-
ial health for epidemiological studies.
While it has been established that diet and dietary pat-
tern play a role in the prevention of hypertension, the
role of diet on APP has not been determined. The pro-
portion and type of macronutrients (carbohydrate
(CHO), protein and fat) may be associated with arterial
health. Current dietary guidelines regarding the type and
proportion of macronutrient for persons with diabetes
by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have not
been consistently supported by the literature. While
ADA advocates a high fiber, high CHO diet, studies
have found beneficial diabetes outcomes with high pro-
tein, low CHO diets. Several clinical trials have reported
dietary composition, mainly proportion of calories from
CHO, have an effect on blood pressure for normo- and
hypertensive adults [13-16]; however, few studies com-
pare these effects for persons with type 2 diabetes. The
highest dietary type and source of monounsaturated
fatty acid (MUFA), is from oleic acid found primarily in
unrefined (virgin) olive oil, followed by high oleic-sun-
flower and safflower oil and canola oil [17]. A random-
effect model of ten studies found diets high in CHO
and low in MUFA were associated with a higher SBP
{2.6 (0.4, 4.7) mm Hg; p = 0.002} and DBP {1.8 (0.01,
3.6) mm Hg; p = 0.05} [18]. However, a review of epide-
miological studies assessing the effect of MUFA for nor-
mal populations on blood pressure revealed conflicting
results [17]. Even though there were few epidemiological
studies from Mediterranean countries, the results all
indicated that MUFA intake was inversely associated
with blood pressure [17]. Patients with type 2 diabetes
(N = 15) from a 3-week, crossover diet intervention
were found to have reduced blood pressure with a 30%
MUFA/30% CHO diet as compared to a 10%MUFA/
50% CHO diet [19]. Current analysis in our laboratory
of Hispanics by diabetes status reported an inverse rela-
tionship between carbohydrate intake and APP for indi-
viduals with diabetes; while protein intake was inversely
associated with APP for persons without diabetes. Based
on these finding, our objective was to assess APP and
its association with macronutrient by diabetes status for
a multiethnic sample. We hypothesized that CHO, with
respect to total calories and fiber, would be positively
associated with higher APP in individuals with diabetes
regardless of gender and ethnicity. We further hypothe-
sized that MUFA would be inversely associated with
APP for individuals regardless of diabetes status, gender
and ethnicity.
Methods
This study was a cross-sectional, secondary analysis of
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
NHANES 2007-2008 [20] adults'  21 with and without
diabetes from three ethnicities: Mexican American (MA);
Black, non-Hispanic (BNH); and White, non-Hispanic
(WNH). NHANES has 5 categories for ethnicity, the sam-
ple size for individuals with diabetes in 2 categories:
"Other Hispanic" and "Other" was insufficient for multiple
comparisons and were not used in the analysis. Partici-
pants were (N = 4766) adults with (n = 622) and without
diabetes (n = 4144) and for whom dietary and anthropo-
metric data were available. The two-year sample weight
for laboratory analyses was used to achieve a non-biased,
representative sample of the United States population.
Data collection
Raw data were extracted from datasets collected from
the NHANES 2007-2008 [20] available for public use.
Data were available for use without additional informed
consent, since informed consent was obtained by
NHANES and this was a secondary analysis of unrest-
ricted data. This survey contains data for 10,149 indivi-
duals of all ages. The NHANES survey design is a
stratified, multistage probability sample of the civilian
non-institutionalized U.S. population. The stages of
sample selection are as follows: 1) Primary Sampling
Units (PSUs), which are counties or small groups of
contiguous counties; 2) segments within PSUs (a block
or group of blocks containing a cluster of households);
3) households within segments; and 4) one or more par-
ticipants within households. A total of 15 PSUs were
visited during a 12-month period.

For the household interview, participants were those
who understood, agreed to and signed an interview con-
sent for the household interview portion of the survey.
After the household interview was completed, all inter-
viewed persons were asked to complete the health exami-
nation component. Those who agreed to participate were
asked to sign additional consent forms for the NHANES
health examination component. Informed consent was
obtained from each subject in the study. The health
examinations were conducted in mobile examination
centers (MECs); the MECs provide a standardized envir-
onment for the collection of high quality data.
The nutrition assessment was conducted in a private
room in the MEC, by trained dietary interviewers fluent
in Spanish and English. A standard set of measuring
guides were used to help participants estimate food por-
tions that they consumed. The first day face-to face
interview was used rather than the second day 24-hour
recall since the second day interview was conducted by
telephone and values were not available for all partici-
pants. In addition, the telephone interview process may
introduce subject bias since the conditions were not the
same for all subjects telephoned. Finally, comparing sub-
jects telephoned to those interviewed introduces an
extraneous variable when combining both 24-hour
recalls for analysis.
Diabetes status variable
Participants who answered "yes" to the question `have
you ever been told by a doctor or health professional
that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes' were classified
as having diabetes and those who answered "no" were
classified as not having diabetes.
Ethnicity and adult status
Filters were applied to select individuals of age 21 years
or more and belonging to either MA, BNH or WNH
ethnicities.
Demographic and anthropometric variables
There were insufficient numbers of persons at the high-
est education level by ethnicity (based on the estimated
marginal means) so the education variable was collapsed
from 5 to 4 categories. An obesity variable was con-
structed for body mass index (BMI) where BMI  30
kg/m2 and was transformed by natural logarithm to
achieve linearity.
Dietary variables
The first day 24 hour recall were used to construct all
dietary variables. The first day 24 hour recall was chosen
since it was administered in person; whereas the second
day 24 hour recall was conducted by telephone. Mono-
unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and saturated fatty acid
(SFA) intakes were transformed by the square root to
achieve linearity. Carbohydrate and protein were trans-
formed by natural-logarithm.
Major outcome variable
The dependent variable, APP was calculated by subtract-
ing the first SBP and DBP readings for all participants.
The first reading was chosen rather than subsequent
reading since values for all participants were available.
Since a true difference between systolic and diastolic
pressure was sought, actual readings were subtracted
rather than the average.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics and frequencies were run by com-
plex sample analysis for participant characteristics. Sepa-
rate regression models for dietary analysis: fats, protein,
carbohydrate by diabetes status, ethnicity and gender
were performed for APP by complex sample analysis
(weighted samples) using the General Linear Model.
Continuous variables were tested by Q-Q plots and
transformed if necessary to achieve linearity. Known
confounders such as age, gender, smoking, BMI and
Kcal were used for adjustment in all models. Possible
confounders such as poly-unsaturated fatty acids
(PUFA), blood pressure medication, physical activity,
dietary sodium and dietary potassium were included in
the full model and eliminated in the final model since
they were not significant. Statistical analyses were con-
ducted with IBM-SPSS version 18 by the complex sam-
ple module. It has been suggested by the National
Center for Health Statistics [21] to select the sample
weight with the smallest sub-sample based on the major
variables. The sample weight from the mobile examina-
tion center (MEC) for laboratory was used since it con-
tained the smallest sample size than demographics and
dietary sub-samples. Since the dietary sub-sample was
close in size to the laboratory sub-sample, analysis were
also conducted with the dietary sample weight for com-
parison. The direction of all relationships was the same
and magnitudes were not significantly different with
either method. Sample weights were used to achieve an
unbiased, nationally representative sample of non-insti-
tutionalized citizens of the U.S. The group WNH was
use as a reference for race so that BNH and MA were
compared to WNH. For all analyses, p-value of < 0.05
was considered significant.
Results
Descriptive characteristics of the weighted sample are
presented by race in Table 1. Statistical analyses by the
complex GLM, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for
the weighted proportion, were conducted to determine
significant differences for each continuous variable. The
following variables were significantly different by race:
APP, age, diabetes and smoking status, intakes of dietary
fiber and saturated fat. Carbohydrate and MUFA intakes
did not vary by race. The MA group consisted of a

higher percentage of males; while, BNH and WNH were
composed of a higher percentage of females. Black, non-
Hispanics had the highest percentage of reported cases
of diabetes.
Race and diabetes status, were independent predictors
of APP, adjusting for age, gender, BMI, Kcal and smok-
ing (Table 2). Having diabetes and being BNH was asso-
ciated with a lower APP than for WNH with diabetes.
Next a series of models for protein, carbohydrate and
fat intakes were conducted with APP as the dependent
variable. The final macronutrient models indicated that
the dietary variables of CHO and MUFA interacted with
diabetes status in determining APP. Protein was not a
significant predictor of APP; however, CHO and MUFA
were associated with APP. The reduced models for APP
regressed on CHO (Model 1) and MUFA (Model 2) are
shown in Table 3. For Model 1, the simple-sugars-group
was not significantly different by diabetes status or race
and was eliminated for the reduced model. Controlling
for CHO, fiber, age, gender, smoking, BMI and Kcal,
race by itself no longer predicted APP in the CHO or in
the MUFA models. Instead, the 2-way interaction of dia-
betes with race was significant for APP (Model 1, p =
0.006; Model 2, p = 0.007). Specifically, BNH with dia-
betes had lower APP than WNH with diabetes (Models
1 and 2, p = 0.003); whereas MA with diabetes did not
have significantly different APP compared to WNH
(Model 1, p = 0.171, Model 2, p = 0.088). The effect of
CHO and MUFA were modified by diabetes status for
determining an association with APP and was indepen-
dent of race. Having diabetes and consuming lower
CHO was associated with higher APP, adjusting for
fiber, calories, race, BMI, smoking, gender, and age (p =
0.001). Similarly, having diabetes and consuming lower
MUFA was associated with higher APP (p = 0.011).
Discussion
This study examined a non-invasive, surrogate indicator
of arterial health, APP and its relationship to diet for
individuals with and without diabetes. To address the

gap in the literature concerning diet and arterial health,
APP was assessed with respect to diet for a nationally
representative sample of persons with and without dia-
betes. Although several studies and a meta-analysis indi-
cate higher protein, lower CHO diets have a more
favorable effect on blood pressure, there are contradic-
tory findings regarding the proportion of dietary carbo-
hydrate with respect to daily caloric consumption for
persons with diabetes. There are limited studies of
MUFA and blood pressure and no known studies of
MUFA and APP.
Our study found differences in APP by diabetes status
with MUFA and CHO. Specifically, lower intake of
CHO and MUFA were associated with higher APP for
persons with diabetes as compared to persons without
diabetes, independent of race. These associations may
be due, in part, to the replacement of SFA and/or trans-
fatty acids (TFA) with CHO and/or MUFA. The effect
of SFA on CVD has been well-established in the litera-
ture. In the last decade, TFA have been implicated as a
CVD risk factor. Although rare in nature, TFA, ubiqui-
tous in margarines, baked goods, shortenings, fried and
packaged foods, are partially hydrogenated vegetable oils
where approximately 30-60% of the naturally occurring
cis unsaturated double bonds are converted into trans-
unsaturated double bonds [22]. TFA adversely affecting
lipid profile in several randomized clinical trials and
may promote endothelial dysfunction [[22] and
references therein]. Our findings that PUFA was not
associated with MUFA and APP were in accordance
with a 14 year follow-up study of coronary heart disease
(CHD) in men (N = 45,722) initially free of known CVD
[23]. The authors found MUFA intake and CHD were
independent of PUFA intake [23].
Diets high in CHO and low in MUFA were associated
with a higher SBP for a random-effect model of ten stu-
dies [18]. This meta-analysis combined one pre-hyper-
tensive, one hyperlipidemic, four normotensive and four
type 2 diabetes studies. Although the investigators used
the random-effect model which controlled for disease
state, they did not compare individuals with to those
without type 2 diabetes. Rasmussen et al [19] reported a
reduction in SBP and DBP with no change in lipids for
a high fat, a high MUFA diet as compared to an isocalo-
ric and high CHO diet for individuals with type 2 dia-
betes. High protein/low CHO composition diets were
associated with improved glycemic index, blood pressure
and weight loss in persons with diabetes in several stu-
dies [13-16]. Yet, high protein/low CHO diets may not
prove to be beneficial for arterial health for individuals
with certain metabolic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes
or metabolic syndrome) since the long-term effect of
these diets are not known [24]. Glycemic improvement
was most likely a result of weight loss rather than the
particular diet. Isocaloric diets that promote weight
maintenance as opposed to weight loss may be more

indicative of macronutrient consumption, blood pressure
and arterial health.
While there are limited studies with respect to arterial
health and carbohydrate intake, numerous studies have
been conducted comparing fatty acid type with endothe-
lial functioning. However, few studies of fat-type have
been conducted in individuals with diabetes. It has been
shown that endothelial function is affected by fatty acid
content in blood [25] and ratio of polyunsaturated to
saturated (P/S) fatty acids [26]. The mechanisms invol-
ving MUFA on blood pressure and arterial health are
less clear. There is evidence that endothelial products
responsible for thrombogenesis were diminished by a
diet high in MUFA with (22%) MUFA/6% PUFA/10%

 MA and BNH are compared to WNH regarding APP and have higher APP than WNH (positive coefficient).
 MA and BNH with diabetes are compared to WNH with diabetes and have lower APP (negative coefficients, significant for MA, only)
 All participants with diabetes that consume higher CHO and higher MUFA have lower APP than those without diabetes.

SFA as compared to a low fat diet composed of 12%
MUFA/6% PUFA/10% SFA for healthy males [27].
Endothelial function, assessed by flow-mediated dilation,
for men and women with diabetes was not significantly
altered by a MUFA-rich meal; but, was impaired by a
meal high in SFA [28]. These results suggest that
MUFA, in the form of olive oil, may have a protective
effect on endothelial function in individuals with type 2
diabetes [28]. Olive oil, in addition to oleic acid, con-
tains many polyphenols in different amounts and types
from other MUFA oils and these polyphenols may play
a role in enhancing endothelial function by promoting
the formation of nitric oxide and suppressed the forma-
tion of adhesion molecules [23-29]. One reason why
there are conflicting results concerning MUFA intake
and blood pressure may be attributed to the type of
MUFA [17]. Oleic acid may be responsible for the
mechanism promoting blood pressure regulation [17] as
well as endothelial function.
A limitation of this study was its cross-sectional nat-
ure; and therefore, causality cannot be inferred. Diabetes
diagnosis was by self-report and not by medical records;
albeit, the American Diabetes Association[30] and the
World Health Organization [31] endorses the determi-
nation of diabetes hyperglycemia and/or self-reported
diabetes. Although the results were from data weighted
to a nationally representative sample, this comparison
was for three major ethnic groups and did not include
Asians and Hispanics other than Mexican Americans.
Mexican Americans constitute a larger proportion of
non-U.S. citizens and undiagnosed cased of diabetes
than BNH and WHN; therefore, the weighted sample
might not have take into account these differences. We
were not able to assess TFA intake and it may have
been a confounder with CHO and APP. Finally, the
sources of MUFA were not quantified in this study and
variations in antioxidant properties may have been a
confounder in the association of MUFA with APP.
Conclusion
This is the first study that demonstrated relationships
among CHO and MUFA intakes by diabetes status and
race with APP. Arterial stiffness is a major surrogate
indicator of CVD that is associated with complications
of diabetes. This study suggests the balance between
macronutrients for arterial health may differ by diabetes
status and race. Both MA and BNH had higher APP
than WNH, controlling for current smoking and age.
Clinical trials and prospective studies are needed to
determine if dietary CHO and MUFA intakes may be
beneficial for APP for persons with diabetes or if the
replacement of SFA and TF with CHO and MUFA is
protective of arterial health. The inverse relationship of
MUFA intake and APP was observed for Blacks with
diabetes, a population who are disproportionately
affected by elevated BP and diabetes complications.
Identifying the role of macronutrients in arterial health
for individuals with diabetes, would address an impor-
tant public health issue since compromised arterial
health may be prevented by dietary modifications of
macronutrient balance.
