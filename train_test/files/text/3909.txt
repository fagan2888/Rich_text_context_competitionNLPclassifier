Introduction
The morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases
in Lithuania is one of the highest among the European
Union member states. Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and
acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) comprise the largest
portion of cardiovascular diseases.1,2 Epidemiological
studies have confirmed that age, smoking, diabetes, dys-
lipidaemia, hypertension, obesity and gender are inde-
pendent risk factors for atherosclerosis.3,4 The early
detection of patients having a high risk of ACSs is a prior-
ity. Different ACS types such as ST elevation myocardial

Abstract
Introduction: To evaluate the influence of traditional risk factors of ischaemic heart disease and genetic factors to
predict different types of acute coronary syndromes.
Materials and methods: Five hundred and twenty-three patients with acute coronary syndromes (393 with ST
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 130 with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)) comprised the
study group. The control group consisted of 645 subjects free from symptoms of ischaemic heart disease and stroke.
Genetic polymorphisms of MMP-2 (­735) C/T, MMP-2 (­1306) C/T, MMP-3 (­1171) 5A/6A, MMP-9 (­1562) C/T and ACE
I/D were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction.
Results: Patients with acute coronary syndromes more often had ID or II genotype than DD genotype of ACE (P =
0.04) and 5A5A or 5A6A genotype than 6A6A genotype of MMP-3 (P = 0.02) in comparison to the control group. The
genotypes of other matrix metalloproteinase genes did not differ between the groups. 5A5A and 5A6A genotypes of
MMP-3 (odds ratio (OR) 1.5; P = 0.021), II and ID genotypes of ACE (OR 1.7; P = 0.006) along with traditional ischaemic
heart disease risk factors such as smoking (OR 4.9; P = 0.001), hypertension (OR 2.0; P = 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR
2.9; P = 0.001) and dyslipidaemia (OR 2.1; P = 0.001) increased the risk of STEMI. However, the polymorphism of MMP-3
5A/6A and ACE I/D was not associated with the occurrence of NSTEMI.
Conclusions: Genetic polymorphisms of MMP-3 5A/6A and ACE I/D along with conventional ischaemic heart disease risk
factors increase the risk of the occurrence of STEMI, while having no influence on the pathogenesis of NSTEMI.

infarction (STEMI) and non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI) lead to a different clinical course of
ACSs and outcomes and require different treatments.5,6 So
far, there are no data on whether risk factors are different
in particular ACS types. Also, great attention has been
devoted to the evaluation of genetic variation of certain
enzymatic systems, as a potential risk factor in the devel-
opment of different ACS types. The renin­angiotensin­
aldosterone system (RAAS) and the matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a significant role in the
pathogenesis of ACSs and the genetic polymorphism of
enzymes of RAAS and various MMPs may affect the
occurrence ofACSs.7­10 The activation of MMPand RAAS
components is also regulated by genetic predisposition.7,8
This suggests that individuals carrying a higher activity
allele of the certain gene have increased concentrations of
the particular enzymes that play a crucial role in the ath-
erosclerotic plaque instability and rupture, with conse-
quent thrombus formation and the development of a
greater extent of myocardial damage.
The aim of this study was to investigate genetic poly-
morphisms of several MMPs and angiotensin-converting
enzymes (ACEs) mostly expected to play a significant role
in the pathogenesis of ACSs if hypothesising that the dif-
ferent pathogenesis of the two conditions could be under
the influence of the genotype along with traditional IHD
risk factors.
Study population and methods
Subjects
Five hundred and twenty-three patients with ACS (393
with STEMI and 130 with NSTEMI) were enrolled into
the study. All of them were admitted to the Department of
Cardiology of the Lithuanian University of Health
Sciences Hospital between 2007 and 2011.All the patients
underwent coronary angiography, following percutaneous
intervention of the culprit artery and conventional
echocardiography.
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was defined accord-
ing to the standard criteria based on clinical symptoms,
ECG findings and cardiac enzyme abnormalities.11 Family
history, cardiovascular risk factors and current treatment
were obtained from each patient using a standard question-
naire. Hypertension was defined as the presence of ele-
vated systolic ( 140 mmHg) and/or diastolic ( 90 mmHg)
blood pressure or the current use of antihypertensive drugs.
A patient was considered as a smoker if he was smoking at
the current time or had been a smoker in the past. Diabetes
mellitus was identified when dietary treatment and/or
medical therapy was required to control blood glucose lev-
els. Dyslipidaemia was defined as serum total cholesterol
levels of 5.2 mmol/L or more, low density cholesterol
more than 2.6 mmol/L, and/or triglycerides equal to or
more than 1.7 mmol/L or the use of statin medication.12
The control group consisted of 645 subjects free from
symptoms of IHD and stroke matching the study group
design according to their age and gender. The control
group consisted of subjects from a random sample of the
Kaunas population screened within the international
Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern
Europe (HAPPIE) project, the Countrywide Integrated
Non-communicable Disease Intervention (CINDI) pro-
ject and an international study, the Kaunas Healthy
Ageing Study.
Written informed consent was obtained from all the
patients, and the study protocol was approved by the
Kaunas region ethics committee.
Genetic analysis
The DNA was extracted from the venous blood of patients
using the Genomic DNA Purification Kit, according to the
recommendations of the manufacturer. Aliquots of puri-
fied DNA were stored at ­20°C until use in real time quan-
titative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis.
ACE gene I/D polymorphism (NCBI SNP identification
number rs4340) was performed according to Mayer et al.13
To minimise errors introduced by the possibility of mis-
reading, the second independent qPCR amplification with
a primer pair that recognises the insertion-specific
sequence (I allele) was performed in each sample from
patients with the DD genotype. The qPCR products were
separated on a 2% agarose gel that was stained with 1 l
(10 mg/mL) ethidium bromide. An O'GeneRuler 100 bp
DNA Ladder (#SM1143; Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Lithuania) was used to evaluate fragment length. Digested
qPCR products were evaluated under UV light illumina-
tion with the Biometra TI 1 and BioDocAnalyze 2.0 (serial
number: 41290-0; 2.26.11.4 BNA U-536) gel documenta-
tion system. ACE genotypes were determined from
electrophoregrams.
The determination of MMP-2 (­735) C/T (rs2285053)
and MMP-2 (­1306) C/T (rs243865) genotype was per-
formed using commercially available genotyping kits:
C_26734093 20 and C_3225943_10 (Applied Biosystems,
USA). For MMP-3 (­1171) 5A/6A polymorphism geno-
typing primers and fluorescently labelled probes
(Metabion, Germany) listed as follows, were used: for-
ward 5­GTGGCCAAATATTTTCCCTGTATTT­3 and

primers and fluorescently labelled probes (Metabion,
Germany), listed as follows, were used: forward

Genotyping was performed using a real time qPCR HT
7900 Applied Biosystems instrument, USA.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using the Software
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA).
Continuous variables were expressed as means ± stand-
ard deviations (SD) when normally distributed, and as
medians (25th, 75th percentiles) when not normally dis-
tributed. Continuous variables were assessed using the
unpaired Student's t-test and Mann­Whitney U test, as
appropriate. Categorical variables are presented as abso-
lute numbers and percentages, and are compared using the
2 test. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were analysed
with the 2 test. In order to predict ACS in an individual
patient, clinical and genetic variables were put into logistic
regression analysis. Variables with statistical significance
at univariate analysis were further analysed at multivariate
analysis. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Patients with ACS more frequently had arterial hyperten-
sion (P = 0.001), diabetes (P = 0.002), dyslipidaemia (P =
0.001) and were more often smokers (P = 0.001). The
patients with ACS did not differ from the control group
subjects according to weight and family history of IHD
(Table 1).
The distribution by gender, mean age and frequency of
IHD risk factors, cholesterol level did not differ between
the patients with STEMI and NSTEMI (Table 2). Heart
rate (P = 0.001), troponin I (P = 0.001), level of glucose
(P = 0.03) and white blood cell count (P = 0.001) were
higher in STEMI patients when compared to NSTEMI
patients. The left circumflex coronary artery had a ten-
dency to be a culprit artery more often in NSTEMI
patients in comparison to STEMI patients. The frequency
of left anterior descending artery and right coronary
artery as a culprit artery was similar between both groups.
STEMI patients had significantly decreased left ventricu-
lar ejection fraction and more increased wall motion
score index (P = 0.001) as compared to NSTEMI patients.
Patients with ACS (STEMI or NSTEMI) had a higher
frequency of ID genotype and lower frequency of DD gen-
otype of ACE I/D than the control group patients (Table 3).
Lower activity genotypes (ID and II) were more frequent
in the ACS patient group and STEMI patients than in the
control group overall (respectively, 83.6% vs. 78.1%, P =
0.03 and 83.3% vs. 78.1%, P = 0.03).
The genotypes of the MMPs are also presented in
Table 3. The genotype distribution was in Hardy­
Weinberg equilibrium. There were no differences in fre-
quencies of MMP-2 (­735) C/T, MMP-2 (­1306) C/T and
MMP-9 C/T genotypes among the control group, STEMI
and NSTEMI patients. Higher enzymatic activity of
5A5A and 5A6A genotypes of MMP-3 were more fre-
quent in STEMI patients than in the NSTEMI group
(81.5% vs. 72.3%, P = 0.027) or in the control group
(81.5% vs. 73.6%, P = 0.009).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that
smoking (P = 0.001), arterial hypertension (P = 0.001),
diabetes (P = 0.001), dyslipidaemia (P = 0.001), 5A5A and
5A6A genotypes of MMP-3 and ID and II genotypes of
ACE are independent predictors of STEMI (Table 4).
Independent predictors of NSTEMI development were
as follows: smoking (P = 0.001), arterial hypertension (P =
0.002) and dyslipidaemia (P = 0.005) (Table 5).
Discussion
The results of our study revealed that genetic polymor-
phisms of MMP-3 5A/6A and ACE I/D along with conven-
tional IHD risk factors such as diabetes, dyslipidaemia,
hypertension and smoking increase the risk of the occur-
rence of STEMI, while genetic factors have no influence

on NSTEMI development. The state of knowledge about
IHD and its relation to the inflammation process and
genetic predisposition are established.14­16 However, the
manifestation of IHD remains very complicated, unex-
pected and is not so far completely explained. Furthermore,
there are not many data analysing the association of tradi-
tional IHD risk factors with the different ACS forms such
as STEMI and NSTEMI. To our knowledge, genetic
factors were not evaluated between the different ACS
types at all.
The epidemiological studies revealed unquestionable
risk factors of atherosclerosis and IHD such as smoking,
diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension
and physical inactivity.2­5 The exposure to different risk
factors disrupts the endothelial function of a blood vessel,

The results of our research confirm the influence of
traditional risk factors on ACS occurrence. Patients with
ACS more frequently were smokers and more frequently
had arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipi-
daemia. Our study revealed that smoking, diabetes, dys-
lipidaemia and arterial hypertension increase the risk of
STEMI development. However, diabetes mellitus has no
associations with NSTEMI development while smoking,
arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia may be impor-
tant in NSTEMI occurrence. The results of other research-
ers are quite contradictory. According to the data of
Montalescot et al., patients with STEMI more frequently
had arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus than
patients with NSTEMI while the patients with NSTEMI
more frequently were smokers.19 On the contrary, the
results of Di Stefano et al. demonstrated that patients
with STEMI more frequently have been smoking, and
arterial hypertension has been more frequent for those
who had NSTEMI.20 Research by Ino et al. did not reveal
any differences in IHD risk factors between the STEMI
and NSTEMI patients at all.21
The present study also demonstrated the differences in
the basic clinical and biochemical parameters between
STEMI and NSTEMI patients. Patients with STEMI had a
higher heart rate and white blood cell count, higher levels
of troponin I and glucose, as well as more severe heart
dysfunction assessed than in patients with NSTEMI. This
indicates that a higher activity of inflammation, more
extensive myocardial necrosis and disbalance of glucose
metabolism are more common in STEMI patients. Our
results confirm the data of other studies reporting that the
pathogenesis of STEMI is associated with a more active
inflammation process and STEMI may lead to more
extensive myocardial damage and necrosis.22­24 The
research data of Di Stefano et al. demonstrated obvious
differences in inflammation markers between patients
with STEMI and NSTEMI. Patients with STEMI had a
higher concentration of leukocytes and a higher activity
of other markers of inflammation such as high sensitivity
C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and serum amyloid A.20
The patients with NSTEMI had a lower concentration of
leukocytes, and other inflammation markers were not
increased at all.20
Furthermore, in STEMI patients a more severe distur-
bance of glucose metabolism is present. According to our
data, patients with STEMI had a higher level of glycaemia
as compared to patients with NSTEMI at baseline and
patients with STEMI also more frequently had diabetes in
the past. Hyperglycaemia is a predictor of adverse out-
comes in STEMI patients25 as hyperglycaemia increases
the amount of free fatty acids which may reduce vasodila-
tion of small blood vessels, stimulate leukocyte adhesion
and increase procoagulant action of thrombocytes,26 and
worsen myocardial perfusion and contractility.27
Our results demonstrate that the concentration of tro-
ponin I at baseline is higher in STEMI patients than in
NSTEMI patients. As we know, troponin I is the main
marker of necrosis and death of myocytes during AMI and
its level is an important predictor of a bad prognosis after
AMI.28 The results of other authors also show that a higher
concentration of troponin I is detected in STEMI patients.
An increased concentration of troponin I at the acute
period of AMI not only reflects the size of the area of myo-
cardial necrosis, but also demonstrates a higher probability
of repeated ischaemic cardiac events and repeated hospi-
talisation because of ACS or a greater probability of
death.29,30 According to the data of Di Stefano et al. the
troponin I concentration correlates with the level of
C-reactive protein in patients with STEMI suggesting that
activation of the inflammatory system is closely related to
the size of necrotic area of myocardium after MI.20
According to the pathophysiological mechanisms of
STEMI and NSTEMI that we ascribed earlier, we had a
hypothesis that some genetic factors can also be important
in the process of atherosclerosis and may cause the devel-
opment of ACS. The results of our previous study con-
firmed that genetic polymorphism of the AGT gene is
associated with left ventricular remodelling after AMI,

suggesting that genes of the RAAS definitely play a role
in the pathogenesis of ACS.31 Experiments from genetic
studies with engineered mice suggest that the expression
of MMPs influences atherosclerotic burden in animal
models. In in vivo studies, genetic polymorphism has an
influence on the differential expression of MMPs.32 More
than a few polymorphisms of MMPs seem to be associ-
ated with atherosclerosis and the onset of AMI. The com-
ponents of the RAAS may also be important in ACS
development as they have an influence on the function of
the endothelium disturbing the balance between vasodila-
tion and vasoconstriction. Angiotensin II increases oxida-
tive stress and apoptosis of the endothelial cells, affects
the migration of adhesion molecules, chemotactic and
anti-inflammatory cytokines causing the formation of
myocardial fibrosis and production of extracellular
matrix. In certain conditions, angiotensin II can cause
acute rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque and a hyper-
thrombotic condition.33­35 Moreover, the elements of
MMPs and RAAS systems interact and may influence the
activity of each other.36,37
Our results demonstrate that 5A5A and 5A6A geno-
types of MMP-3 are associated with STEMI development
while they have no importance in NSTEMI development.
This may be explained by the higher enzymatic activity of
the 5A allele if compared to the 6A allele.38 Patients with a
more active genotype (5A5A or 5A6A) of MMP-3 have a
higher expression of MMP-3 in the serum and tissues,
have smaller atherosclerotic plaques with a small amount
of connective tissue and a thin fibrous cap which is more
frequently prone to rupture.17,18 The results of other
research confirm that MMP-3 5A5A genotype is important
in AMI development,39­41 especially for people from the
Asian population. However, the value of the 5A allele in
AMI occurrence is not so important in the European popu-
lation.42­44 The research data from the Germans and
Italians did not show any associations between the MMP-3
5A/6A polymorphism and IHD.
ACE I/D definitely takes part in the pathogenesis of
some cardiovascular diseases such as arterial hyperten-
sion, cardiomyopathies and aortic pathology. The associa-
tion of this gene with AMI development is disputable. Our
study shows that ID and II genotypes of ACE are associ-
ated with STEMI development. However, other research-
ers provide quite conflicting data. Some scientists declare
that particularly the D allele of ACE may be important in
ACS occurrence, while others demonstrate that ACE poly-
morphism does not account for ACS development at all.45­
47 Functionally the D allele of ACE is more active and
determines a higher enzymatic expression of ACE in tis-
sues and blood causing its deleterious effects as described
earlier. It is difficult to explain the data of our research as
we have found that genotypes II and ID of ACE with lower
activity are more valuable in the prediction of STEMI. It
may be explained by that fact that polymorphism of ACE
I/D influences the development of STEMI indirectly
through the other enzymatic systems (MMPs, etc.) or
affecting the pharmacokinetics of the medication used.
In conclusion, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and
arterial hypertension are undoubted risk factors for IHD
and can cause STEMI and NSTEMI in which the metabo-
lism of glucose is more important in STEMI pathogenesis
rather than NSTEMI. Pathogenetic differences between
STEMI and NSTEMI, different morphology of the athero-
sclerotic plaque and its rupture can be determined by
genetic predisposition. The polymorphism of MMP-3 and
ACE may be important in STEMI development. According
to our data these genotypes are not valuable in association
with NSTEMI development. However, traditional IHD
factors have a superior role over the genetic factors in
STEMI prediction.
