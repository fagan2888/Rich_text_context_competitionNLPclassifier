Abstract
This article uses a 36-million word corpus of news reporting on Hurricane Katrina in the
United States to explore how computer-based methods can help researchers to investigate the
construction of newsworthiness. It makes use of Bednarek and Caple's discursive approach to the
analysis of news values, and is both exploratory and evaluative in nature. One aim is to test and
evaluate the integration of corpus techniques in applying discursive news values analysis (DNVA).
We employ and evaluate corpus techniques that have not been tested previously in relation to the
large-scale analysis of news values. These techniques include tagged lemma frequencies, collocation,
key part-of-speech tags (POStags) and key semantic tags. A secondary aim is to gain insights into
how a specific happening ­ Hurricane Katrina ­ was linguistically constructed as newsworthy in
major American news media outlets, thus also making a contribution to ecolinguistics.

Introduction
This article is concerned with analysing news values (Galtung and Ruge, 1965) with
corpus linguistic techniques. It does so through a case study on one culturally important
event: Hurricane Katrina, one of the costliest and deadliest storms in American history.
Instrumental in how Hurricane Katrina has been conceptualised as a natural disaster is
the vast amount of news reporting that has been published in the American news media.
This is because the news media have traditionally been viewed as providing a `window
on the world' (Tuchman, 1978: 1), and as a result, we may say that news `defines and
shapes' events (Tuchman, 1978: 184). In addition, Bednarek and Caple (2014) suggest
that linguistic analysis can reveal how an event is established as newsworthy.
This article therefore aims to make two contributions: first and foremost, it contrib-
utes to the study of newsworthiness/news values and the evaluation of corpus linguistic
techniques. Second, by using a case study that focuses on an important environmental
event, this article also makes a contribution to ecolinguistics, which is concerned with
the relation between language and the environment (see Bednarek and Caple, 2010; Fill
and Mühlhäusler, 2001, for overviews). From an ecolinguistic perspective, there is not
much work on the reporting of environmental matters in the media (Mühlhäusler, 2003),
although climate change news has seen some attention (e.g. Bell, 1991; Carvalho, 2007;
Grundmann and Krishnamurthy, 2010), and Johnson et al. (2010) have analysed
American television news on Hurricane Katrina from a critical discourse analysis (CDA)
perspective. With respect to environmental disaster reporting, Cottle (2009) argues that
we `need to better understand how the news media variously enter into their constitution
and forms of response' (p. 70).
A discursive approach to news values
The body of research on news values is vast and diverse, existing mostly within the dis-
cipline of journalism and communications studies (see Caple and Bednarek, 2013, for a
review). By and large, news values are said to drive what makes the news, and the focus
of this discipline is on answering the question why events make it into the news media.
Within linguistics, news values are mainly discussed in passing, with only some excep-
tions, such as Bell (1991), Bednarek (2006) and Cotter (2010). Bell (1991: 76) proposes
that language can be used to maximise news value, and Bednarek (2006) takes up Bell's
suggestion with a focus on evaluative language, whereas Cotter (2010) is concerned with
ethnographic newsroom analysis. Caple and Bednarek (2013) and Bednarek and Caple
(2014) provide further discussion of linguistic approaches to news values.
From the `discursive' perspective that we are taking here, we are concerned with how
an event is constructed as newsworthy through semiotic resources such as language, as
summarised in Table 1 (for comprehensive discussion see Bednarek and Caple, 2012a,
2012b, 2014).1
One aim of such an approach is to analyse news reporting around an event to identify
what values are emphasised and how each news value is constructed linguistically. To
clarify, we will undertake a brief example analysis. The following text is from the front-
page story of the Times-Picayune (New Orleans), published on Tuesday, 30August 2005,
the day after Katrina made landfall in Louisiana:

Headline: CATASTROPHIC
Sub-head 1: STORM SURGE SWAMPS 9TH WARD, ST. BERNARD
Sub-head 2: LAKEVIEW LEVEE BREACH THREATENS TO INUNDATE CITY
Lead paragraph:
Hurricane Katrina struck metropolitan New Orleans on Monday with a staggering blow, far
surpassing Hurricane Betsy, the landmark disaster of an earlier generation. The storm flooded
huge swaths of the city, as well as Slidell on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, in a process
that appeared to be spreading even as night fell.
The headline, CATASTROPHIC, is an example of maximally intensified negative
lexis, and simultaneously constructs Negativity and Superlativeness. The effects of the
event (Impact) and its scale (Superlativeness) are emphasised through expressions such
as swamps, threatens to inundate, with a staggering blow, far surpassing, flooded huge
swaths and spreading even as night fell. The event is also established as highly relevant
through references to places that would be well known to the local target audience of The
Times-Picayune, constructing Proximity (e.g. 9th ward, St Bernard, Lakeview Levee, New
Orleans, Slidell, Lake Pontchartrain). Timeliness is also established, as the event is iden-
tified as recent (e.g. on Monday) and ongoing (appears to be spreading as night fell),
with the use of the present tense in the sub-headlines a conventionalised device of estab-
lishing a sense of immediacy (swamps, threatens).
This brief analysis demonstrates how the Times-Picayune emphasises the event's high
negative and ongoing impact for its local target audience. Methodologically, we have
proceeded via manual discourse analysis. But, as Hunston (2011) notes, `ways have to be
found to translate research questions prompted by discourse analysis into corpus

interrogation questions' (p. 167). In this article, we will test whether discursive news
values analysis (DNVA) can be applied on a much larger scale through corpus linguistic
techniques.
Corpus design and techniques
The Katrina corpus
This study is based on a specialised corpus of newspaper texts from an online news aggre-
gator (Potts, 2013). The sampling unit is a single article (containing headline, byline,
dateline, source name, publication date and publication section, where available), and the
sampling frame consists of all database articles meeting the following parameters:
1. originally published in a major American print publication;
2. published between 25 August 2005 and 31 August 2006 ;
3. containing search terms Katrina AND (hurricane OR storm OR flood OR
disaster).
This resulted in a corpus of 36,736,679 words in 41,964 texts from 24 publications.
As texts were gathered from an online database, metadata pertaining to the original sec-
tion and page number of texts is erratically included and often unreliable. Therefore,
texts from various subgenres of reporting (e.g. letters to the editor, obituaries) are
included in the corpus. Although the overwhelming majority of data is news, it is not
possible to identify the exact proportion of other newspaper matter without manually
checking metadata in 41,964 texts. However, by focusing on high-frequency items we
may be able to limit the influence of non-news and the influence of special topic news
(e.g. business, sports).
For corpus analysis, we used the web-based corpus analysis system CQPweb (Hardie,
2012), which annotated the data using the seventh version of the Unit for Computer
Research on the English Language (UCREL) Constituent Likelihood Automatic Word-
tagging System (CLAWS), and the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS), assigning
part-of-speech (POS) and semantic tags (semtags) to each text. CLAWS has an error rate
of approximately 1.5%, with around 3.3% of ambiguities (such as multiple tags assigned to
words that may belong to two classes) left unresolved (Leech et al., 1994: 625). Using the
same corpus as in this article, Potts (2013) found that in approximately 90% of cases,
USAS provided the most appropriate semtag for a word in its given context (in 85% of
cases this was listed first in the string of candidates and deemed `most likely' by the tag-
ger). This leaves approximately 10% of (mostly low-frequency) types incorrectly matched
or unmatched. These were deemed acceptable confidence thresholds for this study.
Using corpus linguistic techniques to analyse news values
In this section, we briefly explain the corpus techniques that have so far been employed
in DNVA. Bednarek and Caple (2012b) use frequency lists and concordancing for analy-
sis of news values in one environmental news story, complementing this with manual
multimodal discourse analysis. Bednarek and Caple (2014) suggest that various corpus
154 Discourse & Communication 9(2)
linguistic techniques can be used to study newsworthiness. However, for reasons of
scope, they focus only on word/bigram frequency and keywords, applying two different
methods to a small corpus (approximately 70,000 words).
The first method is to manually identify, from frequency/keywords lists, those forms
that seem to have the potential to construct news values. These are called `pointers'
(Bednarek and Caple, 2014: 145) to newsworthiness and examples include yesterday
(Timeliness), chief executive (Eliteness), the most (Superlativeness), England (Proximity
for a British target audience), attack (Negativity) and the first (Novelty). Concordance
analysis allows for qualitative examination of these forms, while range analysis can help
to identify in how many different texts they occur.
The second method is to investigate topic-associated words using concordancing to
gain insights into which news values are associated with particular concepts or entities.
For example, the word car, which has no apparent potential to construct news value, is
frequent in Bednarek and Caple's corpus, and concordances can show what news values
are discursively associated with it.
In this article, we provide a first case study on a large newspaper corpus, including
both synchronic and diachronic aspects of analysis. The main aim of this case study is to
apply and test the integration of corpus techniques in DNVA. We evaluate corpus tech-
niques that were not tested previously, in particular tagged lemma frequencies, colloca-
tion, key part-of-speech tags (POStags) and key semantic tags.
The main statistic employed here is log likelihood (LL). We use the LL ratio for ranking
keyness and identifying statistically significant collocates by measuring the confidence
that results are not due to chance (Rayson et al., 2004). This tends to favour higher-
frequency words, and is preferred here for this reason to avoid a potential skewing by low
frequency and therefore less-dispersed collocates, which might occur in special topic news,
obituaries or letters to the editor (cf. section `The Katrina corpus'). For this reason, we also
set a minimum of five for frequency of node, collocate and collocation. We mainly use a
window span of four words to the left to four words to the right (4L-4R), as this is the most
commonly used in corpus linguistic studies on English, although a window of five is also
common in computational linguistics (McEnery and Hardie, 2012: 129). We recognise that
choice of statistic is not unproblematic. Ranking keywords by LL has recently been prob-
lematised (e.g. Gabrielatos and Marchi, 2012), but it remains the most widely used keyness
statistic, and as a result, no other option has been offered to date in CQPweb and Wmatrix,
the concordancers utilised here. Furthermore, since different collocation measures mean
different results, this is an area where future experimentation could be undertaken ­ which
collocation measures work best for identifying news values?
Although the main objective of this study is an investigation into the use of corpus-based
techniques to explore newsworthiness, we are also working with discourses. Therefore, as a
side effect, we will also gain insights into how a specific happening ­ Hurricane Katrina ­
was linguistically constructed as newsworthy in major American newspapers.
Findings
Sections `The tagged lemma frequency list' and `Collocation' focus on tagged lemma
frequencies and collocation analysis, using a subset of the Katrina corpus, comprising
Potts et al. 155
the months August and September 2005. The storm touched down in the last week of
August, which makes the data from this month potentially the richest. The subsequent
month includes the largest amount of Katrina material. This subcorpus (9.65 million
words) hence focuses on the earlier stages of the event and news cycle. Analyses will be
synchronic.
In sections `Key parts-of-speech'and `Key semantic tags', we perform keyness analy-
sis of POS and semantic tags across a short-term diachrony, to test whether key linguistic
devices indicate changed news values in Hurricane Katrina reporting over time. For this
section, we compare three subcorpora: August 2005 (608,985 words in 684 texts),
September 2005 (9,043,083 words in 10,219 texts) and October 2005 (4,557,231 words
in 5360 texts). The August subcorpus contains texts published as the event unfolded,
whereas the September subcorpus reflects the immediate aftermath, and the October
subcorpus encompasses coverage of the continuing fallout.
The tagged lemma frequency list
Table 2 shows a list of the top 200 most frequent lemmas used as a particular POS, cat-
egorised according to perceived potential to construct a specific news value and exclud-
ing punctuation (the tags are explained at http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/URG/codes.
html#klettpos, accessed 12 June 2014).2 This categorisation is based on hypothesis ­ no
concordancing or collocation analysis was undertaken at this stage, because of the high
raw frequencies of these top 200 (ranging from 4939 to 467,450), unless specifically
mentioned below. Where specific examples are provided, they come from the corpus. We
have avoided multiple categorisations, but do note occasionally when an item could also
be placed in a different category.
As expected, there are many function words that are not clearly identifiable as point-
ers to a specific news value. This is not to say that they cannot be used to construct
newsworthiness, depending on the co-text (Bednarek and Caple, 2014: 147). The table
also includes nouns, verbs and adjectives that tell us little in and of themselves about
newsworthiness, although in a specific co-text they might construct news values. To give
just one example, lemmas like company, business, school and center may be used with
proper nouns which establish the local (Proximity) or elite (Eliteness) nature of the
respective entity.
There is also a considerable amount of high-frequency verbs that do not clearly point
to a specific news value, including reporting expressions (e.g. say, tell). As hypothe-
sised by Bednarek and Caple (2014: 147), reporting verbs are nevertheless useful as a
starting point, because we can analyse the speakers associated with such verbs in terms
of constructed status: ordinary affected people/eye witnesses (Personalisation) versus
authorities (Eliteness). Collocation analysis may be helpful here, especially when deal-
ing with a large corpus. Table 3 shows the top 50 collocates, excluding punctuation, for
the lemma say, which is the most frequent reporting verb at rank 10 with 86,700 instances.
Table 3 suggests that elite sources are often cited, as indicated through the high-status
or authority role labels such as officials, analysts or executive, and proper nouns referring
to leading politicians (President George Bush, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana
Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco). Concordancing shows that Maestri also refers to

two less well-known news actors constructed as authority: Walter Maestri (Jefferson
Parish Emergency Management Director) and William Maestri (superintendent of
schools for the Archdiocese of New Orleans). Other collocates are not easily classifiable,
either because they are pronouns or general terms of address or because they are com-
mon surnames (Smith, Williams, Davis, Brown) or first names (John, Mike, Robert, Jim,
Michael), which can be used with both elite and ordinary news actors. Concordancing
could be used to establish proportions of `ordinary' versus `elite' speakers here.
Nevertheless, this very brief collocation analysis confirms the hypothesis that reporting
verbs can be a useful starting point for investigating news values.
To return to the broader discussion of Table 2, it may appear surprising that the
positive lemma good is so frequent, occurring 7769 times in the corpus. After all,
Negativity is more commonly recognised as a news value than Positivity (though see
Harcup and O'Neill, 2001: 279 and Schulz, 1982: 152 on positive news); indeed,
Negativity has been called `the basic news value' (Bell, 1991: 156). However, the
adjective good (comprising the word forms good, better, best) may not necessarily
refer to positive happenings and events around Katrina (collocates of best include
way, thing, interests, friends, worst) and may also be negated (e.g. not/n't occur 309
times to the left of the word form good) or used for comparison (e.g. than is the most
significant 4L/4R collocate of better). Nevertheless, this is an intriguing finding and
an example where a frequency list can come up with unexpected results, which can
then be explored further.
We now move on to those lemmas that can be classified as potential pointers to a
specific news value (based on Table 1). For Eliteness, this includes the proper noun bush
and his title president, as well as adjectives and nouns pointing to authorities or official
services such as official, federal, red (as in Red Cross), government, service, team and
agency. For Personalisation, this includes lemmas pointing to ordinary people: people,
family, resident, child ­ to this we can add evacuee and victim (from the Negativity and
Impact row). From the perspective of news values analysis, the latter nouns construct

ordinary people as negatively affected by the hurricane, simultaneously establishing
Personalisation, Negativity and Impact. More detailed analysis of attributes and naming
strategies for human referents in the Katrina corpus is provided in Potts (2013).
For Proximity and Timeliness, we have included as `pointers' all potential indicators
of place and time, including expressions that may anaphorically, cataphorically or exo-
phorically point to a place (there, here) or time (then), for example,
We know the devastation is worse there [the coast] than it is here [Lucedale]. (Atlanta Journal
­ Constitution)
We must emphasise, however, that not all place and time references establish
Proximity and Timeliness. The question is whether or not a particular place reference
constructs the event as geographically or culturally near the target audience and whether
or not a particular temporal reference constructs the event as recent, ongoing, about to
happen or seasonal. Thus, lemmas like after, when, before, while may more often sim-
ply construct temporal relations between happenings, rather than constructing news
value, as in this example:
The water and sewage pumps in the coastal refinery city of Baytown malfunctioned during the
hurricane, and residents were asked to conserve water Saturday while the city worked on the
problem. (Washington Post)
A word like there can simply be used in existential constructions, too, rather than
constructing Proximity:
The deaths were declared storm-related because there was some physical evidence the person
made an effort to survive after the storm, Eckert said. (Times-Picayune)
For Proximity, pointers further include the first person plural lemmas we and our.
When used in a way that includes the target audience, these can establish Proximity.
However, since there are 38,710 instances of we and 9941 instances of our, extrapola-
tions from small samples might be the only way of establishing the extent of inclusive
usage here.
To continue with our discussion of Table 2, pointers to Novelty comprise indications
of `newness' (new, first), which emphasise the various ways in which aspects of events
are new or `a first'.3 This is very common in news discourse in general, but collocation
or concordance analysis could tell us more about the specific entities constructed as
`novel' in Katrina reporting.
Pointers to Superlativeness include quantification and intensification. Even small
numbers (one, two, three) may intensify on occasion (e.g. one billion), as may the lem-
mas some (e.g. some of the toughest times) and any (e.g. we don't have any insurance.
None. Not a dime). like can be used in a simile to intensify (e.g. Home . . . looks like a
`war zone'; it looks like a bomb went off), which is why it is included here, but it is mul-
tifunctional and not all of its 7800 instances are likely used to intensify. than is included
in this category because we assume it occurs in intensifying constructions such as more
. . . than, or ADJ-er than. just, even, only construct Superlativeness in expressions like
Potts et al. 159
prices tripled in just weeks; even metro Atlanta could feel some effects of the storm; in
only four hours Saturday, the Salvation Army raised $10,922.
Finally, the last row in Table 2 includes pointers to both Negativity and Impact. They
are included in the same category here because impact tends to be constructed as nega-
tive in disaster reporting. This category includes words which construct cause­effect
relations (because, leave; e.g. more than 1
million people could be left stranded) and
hurricane-related labels (hurricane, storm), including its name (katrina), since hurri-
canes are likely to be culturally evaluated as negative. Also included are words that
construct the event as a problem (disaster, emergency) and words we hypothesise refer
to needing or providing help (help, relief, effort) or to the hurricane's negative effects,
including on people (damage, evacuee, victim).
Perhaps slightly more problematically, we have also included the lemmas oil, gas,
food, price, money and move. We have included these here because we hypothesise that
they refer to negative effects in terms of prices and availability of oil, gas, food and the
movement of people after disasters (non-causative leave may also be used here). This
hypothesis is grounded in previous research on the event, as well as an understanding of
the corpus and its sociocultural context. Potts (2013: 124) shows that adjectival collo-
cates from the semantic category `movement, location, travel and transport' co-occur
with naming strategies resident, victim and survivor in the Katrina corpus. News
worthiness is socially negotiated, and so it is critical that any analysis of newsworthiness
is buttressed by research into and awareness of the sociocultural context. Although it is
impossible to read each text in this corpus in depth, we know that the gulf region is a
known industrial hub, so oil, gas, price, money are likely to refer to the hurricane's nega-
tive impact. Some instances may result from the business news stories in the corpus, as
explained earlier.
It is now time to evaluate the technique of using a tagged lemma list to explore news
values. Where it appears superior to a pure frequency list is in its power to disambiguate.
For example, the use of new tagged as substantive shows instances where it is used as
part of a location name (New Orleans ­ Proximity), whereas its use as an adjective may
construct Novelty. It also allows the identification of high-frequency lemmas such as say
as well as the frequency of its individual word forms. However, the tagged lemma list
does share some of the problems of the frequency list. Word forms and lemmas are mul-
tifunctional. Some have a range of different meanings, so that they may construct differ-
ent news values or no news value depending on their usage and meaning in a given
stretch of text. Others construct several news values at the same time (e.g. victim,
disaster, damage), making multiple classification a messy necessity. These issues mean
that such a list can only be used as a starting point, to formulate a range of hypotheses
which need to be confirmed through additional qualitative analysis.
Collocation
As noted earlier, Bednarek and Caple (2014) use concordancing of topic-associated con-
tent words to find out what news values are constructed around a given entity. However,
when using a large corpus, concordancing may not be viable, and other methods of
exposing `non-obvious' meaning ­ or `meaning which might not be readily available to
160 Discourse & Communication 9(2)
naked-eye perusal'(Partington et al., 2013: 11) ­ in discourse might be employed to better
effect. Here, we explore whether collocation analysis could be used for the same purpose.
To do so, we will focus on the top 100 right-hand collocates of hurricane (Table 4).
Table 4 shows that the top 100 right-hand collocates of hurricane include the names of
various hurricanes and other proper nouns, the latter potentially constructing Proximity
(Gulf, Florida, Miami). Furthermore, most of the noun collocates establish Negativity,
Superlativeness and/or Impact, through reference to providing help (relief, efforts, fund,
recovery, effort, benefit, protection, concert, Lemon-Aid), to the negative effects and
power of the hurricane (aftermath, winds, devastation, damage, impact, disaster, flood-
ing, havoc, strength, rampage, surge, fury), and to affected people (victims, evacuees,
survivors). The latter also constructs Personalisation, as argued previously. Only some
nouns appear unrelated to news values, referring to the stages/actions associated with hur-
ricanes: season, landfall, zone, path, strike, activity. Similar to the nouns, most of the verb
collocates construct Negativity (e.g. threatened), Superlativeness (e.g. slammed) or
Impact (e.g. caused). Often all three news values are established simultaneously: for
instance, devastated and ravaged construct the hurricane as high in negative impact. Only
some verbs refer to the stages/actions of hurricanes, for example, approached, passed.
The adjective collocate subsequent primarily co-occurs with word forms referring to
the negative impact of the hurricane (evacuation, flood, flooding, floodwaters, levee
break, closing, damage, relief efforts), hence clearly constructing Negativity and Impact
(Figure 1).
The year collocates (1992, 1965, 1900, 1969) indicate the importance of historical
comparisons, which are sometimes used for Superlativeness and/or Novelty, and which
may also explain the collocating hurricane names:
The magnitude of the disaster in St. Bernard has surpassed Hurricane Betsy in 1965.
(Times-Picayune)
Katrina would also be the nation's deadliest hurricane since 1900. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)

Table 4 also indicates that 's is a collocate, and follow-up analysis can be undertaken
to investigate specific frames such as the hurricane's * or Hurricane Katrina's *. For
instance, nouns that occur to the right (R1­R4) of hurricane's include aftermath, path,
impact, eye, winds, victims, devastation, wake, fury, wrath, effect, surge, effects, damage,
destruction.Again, the news values of Negativity, Impact and Superlativeness are clearly
visible.
We will conclude this section by briefly evaluating the use of collocation in DNVA.
Overall, this method does show some promise, as it can be used with a large corpus and
allows identification of those news values that are co-textually associated with a particu-
lar word. To explore news values constructed around the entity `Katrina' more fully, we
also need to consider the left-hand co-text as well as collocates for additional referential
devices (storm, Katrina). Around the word form hurricane, repeatedly constructed news
values are Negativity, Superlativeness and Impact. This is an unsurprising result, since
we would expect disaster reporting to emphasise an environmental event's high negative
impact on the community. Since collocation analysis uncovers what we would expect it
to uncover, rather than any counter-intuitive results, it may in fact be a useful technique
for news values analysis: `"uncovering the obvious"... gives more credibility to other
non-obvious findings' (Baker et al., 2013: 30). This suggests that collocation analysis
can indeed pinpoint repeated constellations of specific news values constructed around
entities. However, since it focuses on the immediate co-text, rather than the whole news
article, it can only provide a partial view of news values constructed around a particular
issue. But there is also merit in showing how news values are constructed and collocation
analysis has the power to identify recurring phraseologies (e.g. the co-occurrence of
Figure 1. Concordances for hurricane + subsequent.
162 Discourse & Communication 9(2)
hurricane with high-intensity verb forms such as slammed, ripped, blasted), figurative
devices such as metaphor/personification (e.g. roar, fury, wrath) and rhetorical strategies
(e.g. historical comparison). It thus aids the identification of common conventions and
clichés of hurricane news reporting.
Key parts-of-speech
Can corpus linguistic techniques help us to understand changes in the construction of
newsworthiness over time? To test this, we now discuss a key POStag analysis on three
subcorpora; these comprise August 2005, September 2005 and October 2005.
Key POStags from each of these subcorpora were generated using the other two sub-
corpora as reference. Keyness was calculated using LL with a significance cut-off point
of 0.001%.4 For reasons of scope, only the three items with the highest confidence scores
in each category are explored here at greater length. To do so, we identified the specific
lexical items making up the greatest proportion of each key POS category, and used col-
location analysis to gain a broad understanding of meaning in use, through the lens of
common context. When deeper analysis was needed (e.g. to disambiguate instances of
polysemous words), we took randomly thinned samples of 50 instances and observed
patterns at the concordance level. The first subcorpus to be discussed is August 2005
(Table 5).
The POStag with the highest LL score in August 2005 is `Past tense of lexical
verb', which is somewhat surprising, given that this is the `breaking news' subcorpus.
While the past tense can construct events as recent (the news value of Timeliness),
this depends on specific explicit or implied temporal reference (e.g. yesterday vs last
year). A single item ­ said ­ accounts for over 30% of this result, and occurs with
government officials and spokespeople (Eliteness), and, less frequently, `ordinary'
eyewitnesses (Personalisation); top collocates (span ±3, minimum frequency: 5,
LL>15.13) include he, she, officials, Mr., Blanco, Nagin, spokesman (see also section
`The tagged lemma frequency list' earlier). Other, dramatically less frequent, past
tense lexical verbs (lost, killed, struck, died, warned, caused, canceled, urged)
indicate Negativity and Impact.

Potts et al. 163
`Singular noun[s] of direction'(e.g. north, south, east, west) are pointers to Proximity,
although top collocates highlight a multitude of contexts: the nouns of direction collocate
with proper and common nouns of place (Florida, shore), and measurement nouns and
adverbs (miles, farther). All of these may indicate Proximity, but this relies on the dis-
tance between the location of its target audience and the mentioned locations. US loca-
tions (such as Florida) are culturally/geographically near a US audience (national
Proximity), whereas references to local places construct Proximity for the target audi-
ence of local newspapers (local Proximity). Nouns of direction are good indicators of
local Proximity when capitalised (e.g. `South Carrollton Avenue'), indicating proper
names of places in a given (known) context.
Finally, instances of `Singular weekday noun' underscore Timeliness; in 49 out of
50 random concordance lines, these refer to instances in the (very near) past, report-
ing on the movements, statements, and impacts upon people in the previous week.
`Singular weekday noun' also appears as a key POStag in the September 2005 subcor-
pus, and is the only repeated key tag across the subcorpora (Table 6). Concordancing
shows that these nouns refer to dates that are not recent in relation to the date of
publication and hence do not construct Timeliness. Rather, they temporally situate
events, such as the hurricane's strike, in relation to the present, and contribute to
establishing one of the `"five W's and an H" ­ who, when, where, what, how, why' ­
(Bell, 1991: 175) of news reporting.
One key September POStag indicates clear shifts in comparison to August reportage:
overuse of the `Infinitive' in contrast to previous overuse of the past tense lexical verb.
The infinitive in English is so flexible ­ taking its tense from auxiliaries ­ that it is not a
reliable indicator of Timeliness (though it tends to be present-focused and forward-look-
ing in concordance lines). Frequent items in this POS group favour mental/behavioural
processes (see, know, want, think), including (pro)social activities (e.g. help). While the
infinitive itself does not point to a news value, these lexical items convey both personal
and national Impact. Mental/behavioural processes are individual, and help to convey
personal accounts of speakers in their `own voices', as eyewitnesses, offering Person-
alisation. Many of these mental/behavioural processes (in the infinitive) are incorporated
through inclusion of quotations:

`It's the worst situation you can think of',Wooley told state lawmakers last week, when describing
his visit. `It will make you cry to see it. It's horrible'. (Times-Picayune)
`I have two guest rooms in my home that are sitting completely empty', posted one Atlanta
resident. `I would like to think that if this were me, someone would help and offer me a place
to at least gather my thoughts for a bit of time'. (Atlanta Journal ­ Constitution)
While quotations from high-status professionals generally construct Eliteness, in the
first example above, Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Wooley constructs himself as
an eyewitness, with reference to his particular experience and emotions, thus also per-
sonalising the event. In the second example, an ordinary citizen is offering help through
personally identifying with the affected residents.
What emerges from Table 6 as characteristic of September 2005 compared to the
months before and after is overuse of third personal plural personal pronoun (they). In
only 5 out of 50 sample concordance lines are they named individually in the extended
context; they refers to generalised evacuees, government officials and employees of aid
organisations. This indicates a weaker form of Personalisation, as people are incorpo-
rated as generalised referents rather than individualised actors who are associated with
processes or quotations (see e.g. concordance below). Rather than hearing from indi-
viduals themselves about their experiences, we now hear about groups of individuals,
some of whom are Elite. This is similar to the distancing and objectification in Hurricane
Katrina reporting observed by Potts (2013):
`The result is that many of our citizens simply are not getting the help they need, especially in
New Orleans' he said. (New York Times)
We move on now to discussion of the final subcorpus, representing the continuing
aftermath of the storm. Compared to August and September, October 2005 features a
high amount of measurements and numbers, two of its key POS (unit of measurement,
cardinal number) contributing to this preference (Table 7).
Cardinal numbers do not reliably indicate newsworthiness here, as these include dates
(of varying distance from the present), counts (from small to great) and radio stations.

However, units of measurement (over 20% of which comprises percent itself) construct
elements of Impact and Negativity, conveying either financial cost or enumerating more
emotional responses:
The quantity of debris was daunting: Pieces of roofs, trees, signs, awnings, fences, billboards,
and pool screens were scattered across several counties. Damage estimates ranged up to $10
billion. (Boston Globe)
In a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll released today, 72% said they are somewhat or very
worried about the effects of the hurricanes on the future of the United States. (USA Today)
In the first example, $10 (unit of measurement) billion (numeral noun) in damages are
estimated; in the second example, 72% of poll respondents say they are `worried' about
effects (Personalisation, Negativity, Impact), with the high unit of measurement (72%)
adding Superlativeness. A total of 40 of the top 50 lexical items contained within `Unit
of measurement' are amounts in US dollars, highlighting the continuing negative impact
on financial stability after the storm.
This subcorpus stands apart from the others in one final way: singular month nouns are
key in October as opposed to singular weekday nouns, which were key in August and
September. Events are no longer conveyed in terms of distance within a week, but in terms
of months (i.e. maximally within a year from the present). The most frequent items within
this POStag are Oct. (18.2%), Sept. (12.13%), September (10.48%), Nov. (8.94%) and
August (7.38%), which still convey a degree of Timeliness, as they refer backwards and
forwards in time only one (or, rarely, two) months into the past or future. It must be noted,
though, that Timeliness is usually measured in terms of days rather than months, and one
could argue that the use of month nouns in this subcorpus simply situates events in time.
In this section, we tested whether key POStags are useful for investigating the gram-
matical construction of newsworthiness across a diachrony. We suggested that key POS
categories in August, September and October 2005 could be linked to differing empha-
ses upon various aspects of newsworthiness. However, some key POStags are more
easily linked to newsworthiness than others. On the whole, key POStags serve as good
indicators of differences between various reporting periods, but involve many levels of
analysis to uncover the relationships that may (or may not) exist between these occur-
rences and news values. This includes viewing the constituents of each POStag to gain
a better understanding of prominent patterns contributing to keyness as well as colloca-
tion and concordance analysis of randomly thinned samples.
Key semantic tags
Using USAS, each corpus item was assigned a tag denoting its correspondence to 1 of 21
major discourse fields and 232 subdivisions. The semantic tags `show semantic fields
which group together word senses that are related by virtue of their being connected at
some level of generality with the same mental concept' (Archer et al., 2002: 1). Items
sharing semantic tags (e.g. say and claim) might not be frequent enough in isolation to
make it to the top of a frequency list (as in section `The tagged lemma frequency list'),
166 Discourse & Communication 9(2)
but in combination, may be a useful pointer for broader meanings. In this section, we
consider key semantic tags in August 2005, September 2005 and October 2005 by com-
paring the corpora, as described above. We consider the categories in the first instance,
then describe the most frequent constituents, and finally make use of collocation or
concordance line analysis to illuminate patterns.
The most key semantic subcategories in August 2005, as Hurricane Katrina was trav-
elling across the Gulf Coast, directly relate to the event: `Weather', `Liquid' and
`Damaging and destroying' all convey the Impact of the storm to varying degrees. Items
from the `Weather' category convey Negativity, and are additionally intensified by their
collocates, which construct Superlativeness: Both hurricane and storm collocate with
devastating, major, powerful, deadly and catastrophic; winds collocates with high,
strong, heavy, fierce and powerful; flooding is frequently described as worst, severe,
widespread and extensive (±3 span, LL >15.13 minimum frequency: 5).
Items tagged `Damaging and destroying' (e.g. damage, damaged, broken, broke,
ripped, harm) describe the immediate aftermath of the storm in terms of negative impact
(most prominently), but also in terms of Superlativeness (e.g. with intensified lexical
items devastation, destroyed, destruction, collapsed, ravaged). In an interrelated pattern,
words semantically tagged as `Liquids' describe Impact in terms of direct and indirect
consequences: the category contains 42.61% water and 5.11% waters, contrasting to
29.53% oil, 9.09% gasoline and 4.29% crude. These describe environmental/architec-
tural Impact (flooding, oil spills), but also financial Impact (the rising cost of gasoline).
Impact of both of these types is accompanied by Superlativeness; collocates include
measurements (`27 feet of water') and comparative descriptors (`pushed ... gasoline
prices sharply higher').
In comparison to the key semtags of August 2005 in Table 8, the key semtags of
September 2005 (in Table 9) appear at first glance markedly more `personal'. However,
deeper examination uncovers patterns previously explored. The most key semtag in this
month (`Evaluation: Good/bad') is made up of 60.35% disaster, 13.9% disasters, 6.91%
catastrophe and 1.38% catastrophes. Less frequent are adjectives from the same word
family (e.g. catastrophic, 4.22%; disastrous, 0.98%) and the negative evaluative adjective
worst (1056 occurrences, 10.59% of semtags). This semantic tag thus incorporates both
negative lexis and evaluative language (Table 1), but both types of resources construct the

news values of Negativity and Superlativeness: with the word families `disaster' and
`catastrophe', we are dealing with intensified negative lexis (used in the corpus to refer to
environmental happenings or levels of destruction that are socially or scientifically
defined, such as `was declared a federal disaster area'or `catastrophic damage/failure'),
whereas worst is a negative evaluative adjective in its superlative form.
The next key semtag, `Happy', seems a counter-intuitive concept in disaster report-
ing, but closer inspection reveals that 60% of this category comprises a single type:
(disaster) relief. `Getting and giving; possession' contributes to the same overall ten-
dency: this category contains tokens such as supplies and donations, which, together
with disaster relief, convey Impact, upon both the citizens and organisations providing
aid, and the victims in need of it.
Key semtags from October 2005 (Table 10) also show a distinct semantic field prefer-
ence. Patterns that were uncovered during key POStag analysis also hold strong in the
focus on the monetary Impact of Hurricane Katrina: all three of the semantic subcatego-
ries are concerned with money and business.
Items from `Money: Affluence' (e.g. fund, earnings, income, profit, capital) and
`Business: Generally' (business, businesses, economy, inc. contracts, contract, corp)
emphasise this financial Impact, as well as convey Eliteness (of large, powerful corpora-
tions and funds). Impact and Eliteness are also conveyed through the items belonging to
the `Business: Selling' semtag (e.g. sales, market, buy, trade, sold, sell, sale, markets),
although Timeliness is also integrated, often through predictions of sales/markets futures
(sales of building products are expected to climb substantially). Comparison to previous
market events and circumstances, such as 11 September 2001, also occur:
But investors believe that the hurricanes have made third-quarter results somewhat irrelevant in
terms of predicting what's to come ­ not unlike the situation that faced the market after the
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)
Such a comparison with 9/11 arguably constructs the hurricane's impact both as
severe, and as in line with expectations (Impact/Superlativeness/Consonance).
In this section, we devoted some time to exploratory analyses using key semantic
tags. In contrast to key POStag analysis, which exposed grammatical features that

`pointed' to areas for deeper corpus-assisted investigation (e.g. through the use of fre-
quency breakdowns, collocation, and concordance analysis), key semtag analysis pro-
vided results that were much more easily accessible, either from first glance, or once
frequency lists of the constituent lexis were viewed. This is because semantic fields have
much more in common cognitively than items sharing a word class. Items from a seman-
tic field may share, for instance, specific negative meanings (as was the case with the
negative impact category `Damaging and destroying'), or attract a set of (grammatically
similar) collocates which establish a particular news value (as was the case with intensi-
fying adjectival collocates of hurricane and storm from the `Weather' key semtag). For
an initial overview of key areas that may contribute to constructing newsworthiness in a
given corpus, we recommend key semantic tag analysis over key POStag analysis for
transparency and rapidity.
Conclusion
There are a number of reasons why it is challenging to analyse the construction of news
values using corpus linguistic techniques.5 First, there is no closed list of news value
devices ­ news values can be constructed by an open-ended range of lexical or gram-
matical resources (word forms, lemmas, phrases, whole clauses or sentences). This
means that we cannot search the corpus for a defined set of devices. However, as news
discourse is conventionalised, we could search for selected devices that are known to be
commonly used in news reporting to construct news values (e.g. temporal markers such
as last, yesterday, common emotion nouns such as fear, hope, concern or semantically
related adjectives such as unexpected, astonishing, shocking). Additionally, as we argue
in this study, collocation analysis can be used to identify news values established in the
immediate co-text of topic-associated content words (e.g. hurricane).
Second, if we consider newsworthiness as a property of texts rather than individual
items, we also need to look at how it is constructed intra-textually. For this, we need to
consider the text as a coherent communicative event ­ reading it horizontally and as a
whole ­ which is not a recognised strength of corpus approaches (Tognini-Bonelli, 2001:
19). But where corpus linguistic methods excel is in the identification of inter-textual
patterns in datasets. In so doing, these methods can help to quantify and identify repeated
sequences, uncovering common practices and conventions in news reporting. As our

study has illustrated, corpus techniques can help reveal how phraseologies, figurative
devices and rhetorical strategies construct news value. For instance, in the Katrina cor-
pus a cause­effect relation (Impact) is set up by event (e.g. hurricane) + (the) subsequent
impact (e.g. flooding); Superlativeness is constructed through metaphors and personifi-
cation (hurricane + roared; the hurricane's fury, wrath), and historical comparison (com-
parable in intensity to hurricane Camille of 1969 . . . only larger).
Third, the construction of news values is heavily co-text-dependent, because language
is multifunctional. In Hunston's (2011) words, `the meaning of any word cannot be identi-
fied reliably if the word is encountered in isolation' (p. 14). Frequency lists and keyness
measures, which calculate occurrences without co-text, can be used as input for hypoth-
eses, but concordancing or collocation analysis needs to be undertaken to identify mean-
ings. With a small corpus, this can be more easily achieved; the corpus allows qualitative
investigation of all or most instances of a given lemma, POS or constituent of semantic
domain. It would be possible, for example, to closely examine all indicators of place and
time using automatic tagging with follow-up concordancing. When exploring a large cor-
pus (such as the one used in this study), collocation analysis is helpful, but concordancing
is restricted to randomly thinned samples. There is also the possibility of focusing on just
one news value, as concordancing of more samples is then more manageable.
What are some of the next steps to be taken? More case studies on different topics and
different types of news corpora are needed, and there are at least two additional methods
that need to be tested on large datasets for DNVA: n-grams and p-frames, where word
forms are not listed in isolation but rather with repeated co-textual patterns.6 On a more
theoretical level, the notion of (de)emphasis needs to be investigated in depth. While one
approach would assume that (de)emphasis correlates with frequency of occurrence (rep-
etition), another approach would be positional. From this perspective, news values that
are constructed in the summary (Van Dijk, 1988), abstract (Bell, 1991) or nucleus (Feez
et al., 2008) ­ headline and opening paragraph ­ may be considered as the most empha-
sised, because this part of the news story arguably comprises the `most important news
element of the story in addition to the choice of angle or "hook", or approach to the
subject'(Cotter, 2010: 162). Mahlberg and O'Donnell (2008) and Mahlberg (2009) show
that news story structure can be usefully investigated from a corpus perspective.
This study suggests that all tested methods could provide useful insights into the con-
struction of newsworthiness in a large corpus. While POStagged lemmas and POStags
require comprehensive follow-up qualitative analysis, semtags appear the most insightful
in themselves for providing an overview of newsworthiness, and collocation analysis may
be useful for identifying news values established in the co-text of topic-associated words.

Notes
1. In this article we focus on language, although the discursive approach incorporates other
semiotic resources (see Caple, 2013).

2. No clear pointers to Consonance were identified in the top 200. This might be because it is
rarely individual word forms that establish this news value, with the exception of certain
expressions (e.g. expected, familiar). More research is needed to investigate how Consonance
is constructed linguistically.
3. The word novelty is ambiguous, indicating `newness' or `unusuality'. It would be possible to
re-name Novelty as Unexpectedness and to include newness as a sub-category of Timeliness.
Expressions such as not, just, no, only, but, while, even may need to be added as resources
for Novelty, as negation and contrast/concession are linked to expectations (Bednarek, 2006:
48­49). On the other hand, these expressions would be frequent in any corpus, are multifunc-
tional, and may not necessarily construct newsworthiness.
4. As the corpus has been tagged using CLAWS7, each instance of punctuation has been tagged
as itself (e.g. ;_;). These are not collapsible into meaningful units of investigation, and have
been disregarded. Likewise, only unambiguous POStags and semtags have been considered
for keyness.
5. Some of these points also apply to other phenomena, such as evaluation (see Hunston, 2011).
6. N-grams are `recurring sequences of n words'(McEnery and Hardie, 2012: 41); with p-frames
one slot is variable (e.g. the * of ).
