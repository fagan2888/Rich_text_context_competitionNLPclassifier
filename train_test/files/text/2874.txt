Abstract:
We analyse stylised facts for Germany's business cycle at the firm level. Based on
longitudinal firm-level data from the Bundesbank's balance sheet statistics covering, on
average, 55,000 firms per year from 1971 to 1998, we estimate transition probabilities
of a firm in a certain real sales growth regime switching to another regime in the next
period, e.g. whether a firm that has witnessed a high growth rate is likely to stay in a
regime of high growth or is bound to switch in a regime of low growth in the
subsequent period. We find that these probabilities depend on the business cycle
position.

Non-technical summary
Recently, several papers have tried to follow Schumpeter's (1951) advice and to
establish stylised facts of the business cycle at the firm level. According to these facts,
the distribution of real sales growth depends on the stance of the business cycle. In
particular, the skewness of the distribution of real sales growth has been found to be
markedly counter-cyclical. These papers also found that firms in the extreme percentiles
(i.e. firms with very sharp increases or deceases in real sales) reacted less strongly to
business cycle conditions than firms with moderate changes in real sales.
However, the insights that may be obtained from this line of research appear to be
limited since only results for the whole distribution of firm's real sales growth have
been considered. This is the motivation for the present paper. It investigates stylised
facts for Germany's business cycle based on firm-level data from the Bundesbank's
balance sheet statistics covering, on average, 55000 firms per year from 1971 to 1998.
To trace the dynamics of individual firms over the cycle, we estimate the transition
probabilities of a firm being in a regime of a certain real sales growth switching to
another regime in the next period and found that they depend on the business cycle
position. Furthermore, we argue that extreme states (i.e. very large increases or
decreases of real sales) are prone to extreme movements across the states. In other
words, firms with high rates of absolute growth are more volatile than firms with
medium growth rates.
Moreover, the results confirm that it is the change in real aggregated GDP growth,
rather than its level, which influences firms' within-distribution dynamics. Firms with
low growth rates have a higher chance of improving their position during an
acceleration of real GDP growth, whereas firms with high growth rates face an
increased risk of lower growth in the next period. These results are interesting, since
previous analyses concentrated on changes in the distribution rather then on the
dynamics of individual firms' real sales growth.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Eine Reihe von aktuellen Papieren hat versucht, einen Ratschlag Schumpeters
aufzugreifen und stilisierte Fakten des Konjunkturzyklus auf der Ebene einzelner
Firmen zu untersuchen. Nach den gefundenen stilisierten Fakten hängt die Querschnitt-
Verteilung der realen Umsatzveränderungen vom Konjunkturzyklus ab. Insbesondere
die Schiefe der Verteilung der Umsatzveränderungen erwies sich als ausgeprägt anti-
zyklisch. Darüber hinaus zeigte sich, dass die die extremen Perzentile der Verteilung,
d.h. die Unternehmen mit sehr großen Umsatzveränderungen, stärker auf konjunkturelle
Schwankungen reagieren, als solche mit moderaten Umsatzveränderungen.
Allerdings scheinen die Erkenntnisgewinne aus dieser Art von Forschung insoweit
begrenzt, als dass jeweils die Veränderung der gesamten Verteilung der
Umsatzveränderungen betrachtet wird. Diese Begrenzung motiviert das vorliegende
Papier. Es untersucht stilisierte Fakten des Konjunkturzyklus auf der Firmenebene auf
Basis der Bilanzstatistik der Deutschen Bundesbank. Der Datensatz umfasst im
Durchschnitt 55 000 Unternehmen pro Jahr für den Zeitraum von 1971 bis 1998. Um
die Dynamik der Umsatzveränderungen einzelner Unternehmen zu betrachten, werden
so genannte Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten geschätzt. Diese geben an, wie hoch die
Wahrscheinlichkeit etwa eines Unternehmens mit einem bestimmten Umsatzwachstum
ist, sich in der nächsten Periode in diesem oder einem anderen Regime zu befinden. Es
zeigt sich, dass diese Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten vom Konjunkturzyklus abhängig
sind. Weiterhin zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass Unternehmen in extremen Zuständen (also
mit besonders starken Umsatzveränderungen) zu besonders kräftigen Veränderungen
der Zustände neigen. Firmen mit sehr hohen Umsatzzuwächsen oder
Umsatzrückgängern sind also im Hinblick auf die nächste Periode im Durchschnitt
volatiler also Unternehmen mit nur moderaten Veränderungen.
Weiterhin zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass die Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten stärker von
der Veränderung der Wachstumsrate des Bruttoinlandsprodukts abhängen als von deren
Niveau. Firmen mit aktuell niedrigem Wachstum haben bei einem beschleunigten
gesamtwirtschaftlichen Wachstum eine höhere Chance, ihre relative Position zu
verbessern, wohingegen Firmen mit sehr hohem Wachstum ein erhöhtes Risiko haben,
in der nächsten Periode ­ gemessen an den anderen Unternehmen - ein geringeres
Umsatzwachstum aufzuweisen.

The within-distribution business cycle dynamics of
German firms*
1. Introduction
Schumpeter's (1942: 83 ff.) interpretation of capitalism as a process of
"creative destruction", formulated almost half a century ago, has recently been
drawn to attention by modern economists again (see, e.g., the work of Aghion and
Howitt, 1992, 1998). By stating that firms are the main driving factor in his
theory of cycles and growth, Schumpeter (1951) emphasised that empirical
research should be directed towards the business cycle behaviour of individual
firms. As is well known, macroeconomics took a different approach. The
representative firm became the workhorse in macroeconomic theory, and
empirical research concentrated on the behaviour of aggregates. The assumption
of a representative firm has been viewed with increasing criticism (see e.g.
Kirman, 1992). Models with heterogeneous agents are gaining in popularity (see,
e.g., Delli Gatti et al., 2003 or Ghironi and Melitz 2005).
On the empirical side, Higson et al. (2002, 2004) and Döpke et al. (2005)
try to follow Schumpeter's suggestion and established stylised facts at the firm
level. In particular, these papers document stylised facts for the cross-section
distribution of real sales growth rates. According to these facts, the distribution of
real sales growth depends on the business cycle position: anti-cyclical skewness
is a pervasive finding in all three papers. Another key result of those analyses was

that the extreme percentiles (i.e. the rim percentiles) reacted less sharply to
business cycle conditions than the middle percentiles. Conclusions from this fact
with regard to the behaviour of single firms may be misleading to some extend
since only results for the percentiles themselves were obtained. This is the
motivation for the present paper.
Figure 1: Focus on individual firms rather than on distribution
In the aforementioned literature, the analysis was centred on the overall
distribution of real sales growth rates. In the present paper, we take a closer look
at the within-distribution dynamics of real sale growth rates, i.e. at the behaviour
of individual firms, taking the movement of the distribution as given (as in Figure
1). The aim is to augment the already-established stylised facts with new ones in
the vein of Schumpeter. The analysis will be conducted by using non-
homogenous Markov chains and estimating the respective transition matrices.
Our main results may be summarised as follows. We analyse stylised facts
for Germany's business cycle at the firm level. Based on longitudinal firm-level
data from the Bundesbank's balance sheet statistics covering, on average, 55,000
firms per year from 1971 to 1998, we estimate transition probabilities of a firm in
a regime of a certain real sales growth switching to another regime in the next

period. We find that these probabilities depend on the position in the business
cycle.
The remainder of the paper is as follows. In the next section we will briefly
explain Markov chains and estimation techniques. Section 3 discusses the data
set. Some descriptive results with regard to the cross section of transition matrices
are presented in section 4. Section 5 then deals with the impact of business cycle
fluctuations on transition probabilities. Section 6 concludes.

The variable t
x is a state, to be defined later, in which an object is at time t.
All m possible states are elements of the vector m

then states that the probability of being in a state at time t+1, i.e. 1
t
x  , depends
only on the state which the object belonged to in the last period, i.e.

probabilities are summarised in a transition matrix P of dimension m

chain is said to be homogenous if, for every t, the transition matrix   P

this paper we necessarily assume that the Markov chain is non-homogenous,
otherwise the change from one state to another would be purely random and, thus,
a business cycle interpretation would be pointless. Therefore we will only
consider the non-homogenous case. In this case

2 In earlier discussion this was termed stationary or non-stationary.
Since nowadays these labels are associated with unit-root processes in time series
analysis, for clarity the terms homogenous or non-homogenous are preferable,
despite sometimes being used in a different context.

2.2 Multinomial logit model
To gain further insights into the mechanisms that drive the transitions, one
can subdivide the population into groups according to characteristics which
supposedly influence the process. For each group the transition matrix can be
estimated. The different matrices can then be compared. This is only possible with
a limited number of discrete characteristics and without inference. A more
promising approach therefore is to use regression analysis. The appropriate model
for the present context is the multinomial logit model (McFadden 1974).
In this model, the data are divided into subsamples according to the state the
observations were in at time t. Let us define a variable

 for the k-th observation. The state j the k-th

This is the multinomial logit model. Unfortunately, this model is
indeterminate, since adding a constant to the E vector results in the same
probabilities. Therefore, the model is normalised by setting 0

The parameters are calculated by maximising the log-likelihood function for
(6). The estimates then show the change in the probability of being in a state in
t+1 relative to some base state in t.
Another method to model changes across regimes was suggested by
Spilerman (1972). The sample is again divided into subsamples according to the
state the observation is in at time t. A binary dependent variable is created with
the properties

The definition means that a subset of the population is created consisting of
all observations that are in a specific state at the start of the period. In this subset,
every observation is coded as 1 if it moves from state i to j and zero for all other
movements. Spilerman suggested using OLS regressions; however, as we know,
standard OLS regression leads to heteroscedastic standard errors and to values
greater than one or less than zero for binary dependent variables. These problems
can be avoided by using a logit regression. The elements of the transition matrix
then consist of logistic functions

This means that the average of the predicted probabilities from the
regression is equal to the predicted transition probability for the whole population.
As is clear, all probabilities of moving from one state to another have to add up to
one for each starting state. Therefore, if we use a regression technique for each
possible movement on its own, we are not taking this dependency into account
explicitly. Thus, we estimate both the logit regressions as well as the multinomial
logit regressions which, in turn, only give us the relative change in probabilities.
2.3 Stochastic kernel densities
In the previous discussion of the empirical approach, we assumed that the
possible outcomes are discrete. For a continuous variable, any division into
discrete states is necessarily arbitrary (Bulli 2001). In this case stochastic kernels
can be used for evaluating the transition probabilities (Quah 1997). The stochastic
kernel is a conditional kernel density estimate resulting in the conditional density
function

f  . This function can be calculated, as usual, by
dividing the bivariate kernel density estimate for xt+1 and xt by the kernel density

 (Quah 2006, p 35).
The result is a three-dimensional plot showing the conditional probabilities of
being in a state in t+1 conditional on being in a certain state in t.

After describing our methodological set-up, we now turn to the empirical
part of the paper. It proceeds as follows. After describing the data at hand (Section
3), we estimate the transition probabilities for discrete states (Section 4) and then
use logit regression methodology to examine the business cycle impact (Section
5.1). Since the logit regression is statistically inaccurate, we check these results
with the multinomial logit model in section 5.2. The results we will have attained
by then are checked in section 5.3 by inspecting some of the stochastic kernel
density estimates.
3. The data
For the following analysis we use the Bundesbank's corporate balance
sheets statistics database (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik).3 This is the largest
database for non-financial firms in Germany. Its data were collected by the
Bundesbank in the course of its rediscounting and lending operations. Credit
institutions presented bills of exchange issued by non-financial firms to the
Bundesbank. To verify the creditworthiness of a firm, the Bundesbank bills of
exchange issued by non-financial firms were frequently presented to the
Bundesbank by credit institutions. When a bill was presented for discounting, the
creditworthiness of the issuing firm and all other firms that previously held this
bill needed to be determined. In the case of default, liability for payment of the
bill fell on any firm that had held the bill. By law, the Bundesbank could only
accept bills backed by three parties known to be creditworthy. This procedure
allowed the Bundesbank to collect a unique dataset of information stemming from
the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of firms. Up to 60,000 annual
accounts have been collected by the Bundesbank. Because of the creditworthiness
requirements, the sample is not a random sample of German firms. This is
illustrated by the fact that only 4% of the total number of enterprises in Germany
is covered by the data set but about 60% of the total turnover of the corporate
sector, resulting in underrepresentation of small firms (Stoess 2001). The latter
fact also means that although the sample is non-random, it yet comprises firms

analysis in various directions. For more details regarding the data set, see Stoess
(1998) and Deutsche Bundesbank (1998).

that are very important for the evolution of German GDP.4 It is noteworthy that all
mandatory data collected for this data base have been subject to double-checking
by the Bundesbank's staff. Hence, for a micro-data set, the data at hand should
contain unusually few errors.
Unlike previous studies, we were able to use data from 1971 to 1998 for
most of the analysis. In 1999, the introduction of the euro and the new refinancing
framework made the deals underlying the dataset less relevant. Therefore, we
have substantially fewer observations after 1998, and, thus, we omit this time
period in our analysis. Due to changes in the sector definitions, the dataset had to
be confined to the years 1971 to 1995 whenever industry dummies were used.
Since we are interested mainly in the pattern of real sales, we have relatively few
losses of data due to incomplete and inconsistent reporting. Real sales growth is
calculated for each firm by deflating the firms' sales with the deflator of real
GDP.5 To take outliers into account we have employed a cut-off rate, i.e. a
fraction of +/- 50% growth rate is truncated from the data to take into account
mergers, for instance.6
The next thing to consider is how to define the states for the firms according
to their real sales growth rate. One might choose an absolute criterion for the
states since we have restricted the range of possible values to the interval ­50 to
50%. States such as ­50 to ­40%, ­40 to ­30% and so on might be defined. The
problem with this definition is that distributional and within-distribution effects
are mixed. During a recession, the whole distribution moves to the "left". This
means that many firms move from their original state to a lower state when the
4 This view is supported by the fact that the correlation coefficient
between the GDP growth rate and the mean growth rate of the firms covered in
the sample is about 0.89. Therefore, the following analysis should be interesting
despite the underrepresentation of small firms. Caution is warranted with respect
to extending the results beyond the enterprises covered in the sample.
5 One might argue that each sector should be deflated with its
respective deflator. With the exception of only some sectors, e.g. computer
manufacturing, the sectoral deflators all move closely together; the GDP deflator
hence appears to be a good approximation.
6 The results also hold without any cut-off; we present the results with
cut-off to show that they are not due to outliers. For a discussion of the cut-off
with the present dataset see Döpke et al. (2005).

states are defined as absolute values. The transition probabilities then would show
a lot of movement that is not within-distribution movement but a shift of the
distribution itself. Therefore states that move during recessions together with the
distribution have to be defined. Quantiles are natural candidates. By using
quantiles, we can disentangle the distributional shift (changing quantiles) from the
within-distribution movement (transition probabilities). Since the growth rate of
real sales is a continuous variable, the choice of the quantiles is somewhat
arbitrary. As a baseline scenario, we choose deciles as states. Choosing smaller
quantiles would lead to a large number of results in the subsequent analysis,
making interpretations difficult. To check for robustness we have performed the
same analysis for quintiles as well. The results are confirmed by this definition of
states.7
4. Descriptive cross-sectional results
Using a 50% cut-off, i.e. dropping all observations with absolute real sales
growth rates above 50%, the deciles were calculated for each year. Figure 2 shows
the evolution of the real growth rate of sales deciles over time.
Not surprisingly, the deciles move during business cycles, having lower
values during recessions, examples being 1975, 1982 and 1993. As was explained
in the last section, each decile is regarded as a possible state for each firm. For
every year each firm is assigned a state and from these assignments the transition
probabilities are calculated for all year pairs. Conditional on the present state, we
obtain probabilities of being in one of the ten possible states in the next year.
7 The definition of states also makes the analysis more robust. This
would explain why using no cut-off does not change the results, as mentioned
earlier.

Note: The 10th decile denotes the firms with the largest increase in real sales.
In Figure 3 these conditional probabilities are plotted. Each single graph
shows the transition probabilities conditional on the present state. In other words,
if the graph is named 1.decile the present state is the first decile, the x-axis shows
all ten possible states next period. Furthermore, the y-axis measures the
probability for moving from the first decile to another next year or staying in the
same decile, i.e. each curve represents one row of the transition matrix for a given
year.
A clear pattern emerges. For the lowest and highest deciles a u-shaped curve
emerges irrespective of the year under review. The less extreme middle deciles
show a clear hump-shaped pattern. Those patterns mean that firms with extreme
growth rates are more volatile than firms with "normal" growth rates.
A look at the first decile graph in figure 3 shows us that the probabilities of
staying in the first decile and moving to the tenth decile are the largest. This
means that either the firm stays in the first decile, i.e. the firm will shrink also in
the next period, or it will make a big jump and grow at an exceptionally fast rate.

The latter fact alone is not that surprising. When a firm is hit by a large negative
idiosyncratic shock, it will experience a large negative real sales growth. Once it
manages to return to old real sales levels, in the next period it will necessarily grow at a
faster absolute rate than the rate by which it shrank the period before just by reaching
the pre-shock level of real sales.

Note: "1" denotes the state of the firms with the lowest growth rate of real sales while
"10" denotes the state of the firms with the highest growth rate of real sales.
The pattern for the first decile could therefore just be a statistical artefact.
Interestingly, the pattern of either staying in the same state or making a big adjustment
is also present in the tenth decile graph. Normally, one would expect firms entering a
new market with exceptional growth potential to display high growth rates. After some
time, the market becomes mature and the growth rates drop back to "normal" levels. In
other words, one would expect a regression to the mean process. The transition
probabilities for the first and tenth decile suggest a different story. Firms with extreme
13
growth rates are extremely volatile, having high probabilities of staying in their extreme
state or making a turnaround to the other extreme. Together with the hump-shaped
pattern for the middle deciles, this suggests a two-class firm society. Firms with
medium growth rates have high probabilities of staying in their respective state or
making medium shifts to neighbouring states. The other class of firm has extreme
growth rates and highly volatile shifts of growth rates from one extreme to the other.
Figure 4 additionally considers whether there is a link between the sizes of the
firm and the states, i.e. the average growth rates of the firms. The figure shows the
average size of firms in each state measured by the level of real sales. We see that the
average size is hump-shaped, i.e. highest for the middle states, peaking at the sixth and
seventh states. In Figure 1, those are the deciles with "normal" growth rates between 0
and 10%. The extreme and volatile deciles have lower average sizes than the middle
decile firms. This finding is in line with several analyses in the industrial organisation
literature where an inverse relationship is found between the growth rate and the size of
the firm as well as between the standard deviation of the growth rates of firms and the
firm size (Sutton, 1997).

What is also apparent from Figure 5 is that the transition probabilities vary widely
over the years. A 10
10u transition matrix contains 100 elements and is therefore not
easy to interpret, especially when comparing matrices from different years. One method
is to use mobility indices to condense the information obtained from a transition matrix.
One index, proposed by Shorrocks (1978, p. 1017), is

The index is one for perfect mobility and zero for no mobility at all. The result
together with the growth rate of real GDP is shown in Figure 5.
The mobility index (red line, cross as a symbol) is very high and fluctuates around
0.95-0.96, indicating high mobility. During the first half of the respective time period,
the mobility index is pro-cyclical, while for the second half a counter-cyclical pattern
emerges. The simple mobility index therefore shows no clear pattern for business cycle
implications of the transition probabilities. In the next section we take a closer look at
the single probabilities.
5. Business cycle impact on transition probabilities
5.1 Results from transition probabilities and Markov chains
To gain insight into the behaviour of firms during business cycles, we use the
logit regression method introduced in part 2. We are interested in how business cycle
conditions influence the behaviour of transition probabilities and therefore include, as a
first step, the present and the lagged growth rate of GDP as regressors. From the
industrial organisation literature, it is well known that the size and age of firms affect
their growth rate. We therefore include the absolute value of real sales as a measure of
firm size as regressor. Unfortunately, the data set does not include the age of firms. The
discussion in the preceding section showed that the behaviour of firms with extreme
15
growth rates differs markedly from that of firms with medium growth rates. This might
be due to some sectors being more volatile than other sectors. For this reason, we
included a set of sectoral dummies as independent variables. The regression equation
therefore looks like this:

Y is the binary dependent variable stating that a firm i at time t is in a certain

' is the growth rate of real GDP at time t, it
z is the value of real sales
of firm i at time t. t
D is the sectoral dummy taking the value one if firm i belongs to
sector j and zero otherwise.
The estimation is conducted by a logit regression, as explained in section 2. Since
both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation were present in the data, we calculated
consistent standard errors.8 The regressions were run for every possible dependent
variable, i.e. one regression was run for the variable staying in state one, another for the
variable moving from state one to state two, and so on. The results for the coefficients
of the independent variables are shown in Figures 6 and 7. Each single graph shows the
value of the coefficient moving to the state indicated on the x-axis depending on the
present state, which is indicated by the title of each graph. The lines around the dots
represent a two-standard-error band around the coefficients.
Figure 6 shows the coefficient of the contemporary GDP growth rate. The pattern
that emerges is not easy to see. For the firms in the first three states, i.e. firms with low
growth rates, a boom increases the probability of moving to a higher state, i.e. to a state
with higher growth rate, and reduces the probability of staying in the original state. For
the other states, this effect is less clear but still present. Either the probability of staying
in the original state is not affected (as indicated by the two-standard-error bands), or it is
negatively influenced by the growth rate of real GDP. What is interesting is that, for the
middle states, the probability of moving to higher states as well as to lower states is

OLS, Fixed Effects, Population-Averaged Logit with robust standard errors, etc. The
results were all robust with respect to the different model specifications and are

increased, meaning that a boom phase is not necessarily a phase of improvement for
firms with medium growth rates but might, in fact, lead to worse performance. This is
particularly the case for firms in higher states where the probability of moving to lower
states, especially for moving to state one, is positively affected by business cycle
conditions.

This shows that booms increase the volatility of firms offering both opportunities
for improvement as well as risks for performance. The reverse is true for recessions, of
course.9
The behaviour of the coefficient of lagged GDP growth is clearer than the
behaviour of the coefficient of contemporaneous GDP. A boom in the last period
increases the probability for all states of staying in the same state or moving only to a
neighbouring state while reducing the probabilities of extreme changes, as can be seen
from Figure 7. A past recession will then decrease the probability of staying and
increase the probabilities of moving.
This suggests an interesting pattern for the behaviour of firms during business
cycles. Consider an economy that enters a recession after a boom phase last year. Last
year's boom increases the probability of staying in the same decile for all states. This
effect is strengthened by this year's recession. This means that a recession is a period of
less movement within the distribution of firm growth rates.
Since recessions on average last for about two or three quarters, the next year
would normally be a boom phase. During a post-recession boom phase, the probability
of moving to other states increases dramatically both because of both this year's boom
and last year's recession. If the economy stays in a boom phase for another year, the
influence on the probabilities will be counteracted by this year's and last year's boom,
resulting in a kind of settling-down effect for the distribution of firms. One must bear in
mind, as was shown in Figure 1, that the deciles of growth rates themselves move in
accordance with business cycle conditions. This means that, during a recession, the
whole distribution of the growth rates of real sales shifts to the left. The movement
within the distribution is reduced. During the upswing the distribution shifts to the right
and within movement is higher than during the recession.
9 Since the coefficients are significant for most movements, it is clear that the
transition probabilities are indeed time-varying. This justifies our assumption of non-
homogeneity.

To underline the result, equation (10) was re-estimated using the first difference
of GDP growth as the regressor instead of GDP growth and lagged GDP growth. The
result is presented in Figure 8. As we can see, it is indeed the changing business cycle
conditions that lead to the aforementioned within-distribution pattern.
In Figure 9 the coefficients of the impact of the firms' size (measured in terms of
the level of real sales) on transition probabilities are shown. A general pattern of
convergence emerges: the larger the firm, the more likely it is to be and stay in a
medium decile. This result is a standard result in industrial organisation literature
showing that the discretisation of the continuous real sales growth at least can replicate
other findings.10
5.2 Results from multinomial logit regressions
As mentioned in section 2, the results presented above do not ensure that the
probabilities are summing up to one and are, therefore, just approximations.
Additionally, we therefore present in Figure 10 a regression analysis with the
multinomial logit model. The same set of regressors, with differenced GDP growth, was
used, and again consistent standard errors were calculated. The graph is like the
previous ones except for one feature: the number of states in t+1 excludes the base state
(the state in t) since we only have results for the relative but not absolute change in the
probabilities.
Comparing Figure 10 with Figure 8, we see that the general pattern for the
coefficient is the same for all graphs except for the 10th decile. Here, we have the
problem that the multinomial logit model only shows relative changes. Since we know
that the probabilities of a relative decline in all states in Figure 10 all have to add up to
one, the 10th decile graph means that the absolute probability of staying in state 10 must
have increased (contradicting the result in Figure 8). This absolute rise in the probability
of staying in state 10 means that we cannot say whether the probability of moving to
state 1 increases or decreases absolutely while declining relative to state 10.
10 To take into account a possible endogeneity of real sales we have checked, whether taking into account
the lagged value alters the results qualitatively, which is not the case. Details are available upon
request fro the authors.
22
The result for the 10th decile in Figure 8 therefore is not robust, while the "right" result
is not interpretable in terms of absolute change. The rest of the graphs are consistent,
which leads us to the conclusion that the results in the previous section show us the
right development with respect to their absolute change.

5.3 Results from stochastic Kernel densities
As a last check of robustness, the results for the stochastic kernel density
estimates11 are presented in Figure 11. The upper part of the graph shows the 3D plot of
transition probabilities and the corresponding contour plot for the boom year of 1991. In
the lower part, the respective graphs for the recession year of 1993 can be seen. Both
graphs indicate that the extreme growth rates are indeed more volatile than the middle
growth rates. Comparing both graphs, we see that the extreme positive growth rates
have a higher probability during recessions of moving to negative growth rates while
the opposite holds for the extreme negative growth rates.

according to the Silverman bandwidth selection criterion (Silverman 1986).

6. Conclusions
We analyse stylised facts for Germany's business cycle at the firm level. Based on
longitudinal firm-level data from the Bundesbank's balance sheet statistics covering, on
average, 55,000 firms per year from 1971 to 1998, we estimate transition probabilities
of a firm in a regime of a given real sales growth switching to another regime in the next
period. We find that these probabilities depend on the business cycle position.
Two findings emerge from our analysis. Firstly, extreme states are prone to
extreme movements across the states, i.e. firms with high absolute growth rates are
more volatile than firms with medium growth rates; this result is confirmed by standard
industrial organisation literature. Secondly, the change of business cycle and not the
business cycle condition itself has a marked influence on the firms' within-distribution
dynamics. Firms with low growth rates have a better chance of improving their position
during changed business cycle conditions, while firms with high growth rates face an
increased risk of degradation. Firms with medium growth rates face both risks as well as
chances.
These results are important improvements over the previous analysis (Döpke et al.
2005), which concentrated on the movement of percentiles rather then on the movement
of firms themselves. Two important questions for further research emerge. The first
question is that of causality.12 The pattern of movements across states could be the
result of a macroeconomic shock affecting firms in a different way. According to this
interpretation, the movement of firms is the result of the movement of GDP. The other
possible explanation would reverse the causality. In this case, idiosyncratic shocks,
through some sort of spillover effect (e. g. credit rationing due to bad debts for the
banking sector, as proposed in Delli Gatti et al. 2003), would cause a movement of
GDP. In this case, it is the differing movements of firms which drive the GDP. A third
explanation might be a non-linear combination of both approaches. The distributional
position of the firms is more persistent during downturns and more volatile during
upturns. One might reason that the downturn is then due to a traditional macroeconomic
12 We estimated Granger causality tests for the transition probabilities and the
differenced GDP growth rates but did not obtain a significant result. Progress towards
answering this question is possible using quarterly data, which were not available for
the present analysis.
25
shock while the upswing is driven by idiosyncratic shocks since firms are affected in
different ways.
Another important question is the question of regression to the mean which is
usually found in industrial organisation literature. As was shown in this paper, the
business cycle conditions affect the position of firms within the distribution. Therefore,
the business cycle effects should not be neglected in dealing with questions of
convergence between firms. It might well turn out that the different reactions of firms
during upswings might explain more about the convergence process than the variables
of size and age traditionally used.
