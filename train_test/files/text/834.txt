Suicide, religion, and socioeconomic conditions.
An ecological study in 26 countries, 1990
Jan Neeleman, Glyn Lewis
Abstract
Study objective--Relative risks are fre-
quently assumed to be stable across popu-
lations but this may not apply in
psychiatric epidemiology where sociocul-
tural context may modify them. Such eco-
logical eVect modification will give curved
associations between aggregated risk fac-
tor and outcome. This was examined in
connection with the ecological association
between suicide rates and an aggregate
index of religiosity.
Design--Ecological study of associations
between suicide rates and an index of
religiosity, adjusted for socioeconomic
variation. The eVect of stratification of the
study sample according to levels of religi-
osity, was examined.
Setting--26 European and American
countries.
Subjects--Interview data from 37 688
peope aggregated by country.
Outcome measures--Age and sex specific
(1986­1990) suicide rates.
Main result--Adjusted for socioeconomic
variation, negative associations of male
suicide rates with religiosity were appar-
ent in the 13 least religious countries only
(test for interaction F (1, 25)=5.6;
p=0.026). Associations between religiosity
and female suicide rates did not vary
across countries.
Conclusion--The bent ecological associ-
ation was apparent only after adjustment
for socioeconomic variation suggesting
that, rather than confounding, ecological
modification of individual level links be-
tween religion and male (but not female)
suicide risk is the responsible mechanism.
This concurs with micro-level findings
suggesting that suicide acceptance de-
pends not only on personal but also on
contextual levels of religious belief, and
that men are more sensitive to this
phenomenon than women. In psychiatric
epidemiology, relative risks vary with the
exposure's prevalence. This has important
implications for research and prevention.
(J Epidemiol Community Health 1999;53:204­210)
Suicide rate variations remain poorly under-
stood. Given rising trends internationally that
remain unexplained,1 the search for macro-
level correlates of suicide remains as relevant as
it was when Durkheim initiated it.2 Suicide rate
variations have been linked with local diVer-
ences in unemployment,3 4 divorce,3 5 income
levels,6 education,2 7 per capita alcohol intake,8
birth rates9 and, repeatedly, religious
characteristics.2 6 7 10 11 However, findings are
often contradictory.
In ecological research, the choice which
countries or communities to study is governed
by data availability more often than by a priori
hypotheses. Suicide rates of American states,10
counties,11 12 Canadian13 or Dutch7 provinces,
or Western European countries9 have all been
studied in connection with religion. One study
compared countries as diVerent in religious
context as Israel and Japan.6 The statistics used
in these studies give linear associations between
aggregate levels of risk or protective factors and
suicide rates, implying fixed regression coeY-
cients across the exposure range.
Inferences made from ecological associa-
tions may concern eVects on group rates, but
most often eVects on individual risk.14 Thus,
negative ecological associations between indi-
ces of religion and suicide rates are frequently
taken to imply that, therefore, religious people
are at lower risk of suicide than non-religious
people. The slope of the regression line is, in
such cases, used to calculate relative risks.15
However, cross level bias frequently invalidates
conclusions concerning individual risks drawn
from ecological patterns.14 16 Even when eco-
logical confounding, the first source of cross
level bias, is controlled for, the possibility
remains that the religious composition of indi-
viduals' countries modifies the risk they run
given their personal levels of religiosity. It is
with this contextuality, ecological eVect
modification,14 that this study is concerned.
Ecological eVect modification implies, at the
individual level, that relative risks are not con-
stant but variable according to the risk factor's
prevalence. It has received little attention
presumably because relative risks, whose use
originates in the epidemiology of chronic
somatic disorder, are often assumed to be
stable across populations.17 However, relative
risks in social psychiatry are unlikely to be cul-
ture free. Churchgoing protects better against
depression in religious compared with non-
religious communities.18 Unemployment is a
stronger risk factor for suicidal behaviour when
it is rare.19 Positive life change predicts recovery
from depression better in populations bereft of
such events.20 Moreover, men may be more
sensitive to such contextual eVects than
women. In contrast with suicide rates of
women, those of men depend strongly on social
and economical change.21 Levels of suicide tol-
erance in men, but not women, depend on
beliefs prevalent locally, as much as on their
personal convictions.22
When present, a twofold ecological associ-
ation exists between exposure prevalence and

outcome numbers. Firstly, as in any ecological
study, relative numbers of risk free and at risk
persons vary with changing exposure preva-
lence. Secondly, rates of the outcome in these
two groups will change when exposure preva-
lences vary. This implies that regression coeY-
cients for the association between exposure and
outcome should diVer according to the preva-
lence of the exposure giving a curved or bent
ecological regression line. This has been shown
to apply to the association between regional
indices of religiousness and suicide rates in the
Netherlands.23
Against this background this study's purpose
was to examine whether a bent regression line
fits ecological associations of international sui-
cide rates with indices of religion better than
the straight line usually drawn in comparable
studies.2 6 7 9­13 Ecological confounding, occur-
ring when units of analysis diVer in more
aspects than the variable of interest only, may
also aVect the shape of the regression line and,
when uncontrolled, increase or obscure curvi-
linearity because of ecological eVect
modification.16 Socioeconomic confounding
was therefore adjusted for before examination
of the shape of the regression line.
It remains disputed which aspects, if any, of
religion are most relevant to health outcomes.
Social integration may be the principal media-
tor of religion's beneficial eVects on health2 24
but personal religious commitment, irrespective
of social integration, may also be relevant.6 22 25
From data on religious aYliation, attendance,
education and personal devotion, available
from a large scale international survey con-
ducted in 1990,26 the strongest association of
suicide rates was selected for further study.
The issue at stake, the contextual variability
of relative risks in psychiatric epidemiology, has
wide relevance. The inability of ecological
researchers to agree on whether or not suicide
rates are related to levels of, for instance,
unemployment3 27 is likely to be simply because
of the fact that such general questions cannot
be answered. When unemployment is rife, it
will be a weaker risk factor for suicidal
behaviour than when it is rare19--this will
strongly aVect ecological patterns. The topic is
also relevant for public health oYcials; reduc-
tion of the prevalence of risk factors whose
individual level eVect is subject to ecological
eVect modification, may concentrate the risk in
the most vulnerable.28
Methods
SAMPLE
Countries were selected if (a) they had a
Judaeo-Christian tradition, (b) they reported,
in 1990, suicide and population counts to the
World Health Organisation (WHO) using
ICD-9 codes, and (c) World Values Survey
(WVS) data were available for them. WVS was
carried out by structured interview (375 items)
on random population samples (>18 years old)
in 43 countries across the world26 to explore
links between economic advance and
individualisation.29 Stratified random sampling
was used in most countries but in some, such as
the USA, minority groups were oversampled.
Sampling weights, allocated to all respondents,
allowed restoration of national samples' repre-
sentativeness for international comparisons.26
Twenty seven countries met criteria (a) and (b)
but Finland was excluded as computerised
instead of face to face interviews were used
there.29 The 26 countries included in the
analysis (total n=37 688) with sample sizes are
given in the legend to table 2.
VARIABLE PREPARATION AND AGGREGATION
Religious variables
WVS contains items concerning religious aYli-
ation (overall missing 95 of 37 688=0.3%;
highest in Bulgaria; 28 of 1034=2.7%) religious
upbringing (overall missing 195 of
37 688=0.5%; highest in Sweden; 33 of
1047=3.2%), frequency of church attendance
(overall missing 824 of 37 688=2.2%; concen-
trated in Hungary 324 of 999=32.4% and
Argentina 344 of 1002=34.3%) ánd a series of
22 questions concerning personal beliefs and
practices (for example, "Do you find comfort
and strength from religion"). In Czechoslova-
kia, five questions only of the 22 had been
asked. Excluding Czechoslovakia (n=1396),
3.4% (1244 of 36 292) of respondents had
missing scores on nine (40%) or more of the 22
items with the highest missing rate in Poland
(180 of 938=19.2%). Eight of 1396 respond-
ents in Czechoslovakia (0.6%) had one or more
missing scores. The 22 items were subjected to
principal component (PC) analysis applied to
the pooled dataset (weighted for sampling
diVerences) yielding a main PC (religiosity)
accounting for 48.8% of total item variance.
Missing scores were imputed using best subsets
regression giving values for all but one respond-
ent. PC extractions of the 22 belief/practice
items (five in the case of Czechoslovakia) were
also run on national samples individually. The
correlation between PCs based on these respec-
tive extraction methods was 0.88; p<0.001. The
correlation between the PC for Czechoslovakia
based on its five items and the PC obtained for
this country by imputation of values to the 17
missing items was 0.98; p<0.001. For indi-
vidual countries, aggregate values for religious
aYliation and religious upbringing were ob-
tained by calculation of proportions. Aggregate
values for religiosity and church attendance
were obtained by calculation of national pro-
portions of respondents scoring above the
respective median for the pooled sample.
Suicide rates (/100 000)
For the period 1986­1990, average annual sex
and age (15­29, 30­59, 60+) specific rates of
suicide, and suicide combined with undeter-
mined death, were calculated using data
obtained from WHO.30 Spearman's rank order
correlation between suicide and combined
suicide/undetermined death rates was 0.66
(p<0.001). After exclusion of Chile, which uses
the undetermined death category idiosyn-
cratically,31 this rose to 0.93 (p<0.001). Given
the large eVect of Chile's undetermined death
rates, suicide rather than combined suicide/
undetermined death rates were used further.

Possible socioeconomic confounders
National birth rates,32 average income levels (in
$1000; GNP per capita),32 higher (>16 years)
education enrolment levels,32 divorce,26 and
unemployment rates26 were obtained. For
Iceland and Eastern Germany, birth, GNP, and
higher education rates were unavailable.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Least squares regression of logarithmically
transformed male and female suicide rates was
used. Independent aggregate variables were
standardised to the entire aggregated dataset so
that regression coeYcients represent change in
the outcome associated with one standard
deviation's shift on independent variables. The
eVect of weighting for WVS sample sizes (to
reflect higher precision of measures aggregated
from larger samples) was assessed.33 When
more than one rate per country was
modelled--that is, when age was considered as
a confounder (compare with age standardisa-
tion), Huber's adjustment of standard devia-
tions was made to account for national rate
clustering.34 Missing scores of socioeconomic
confounders were imputed using best subsets
regression34; the eVect of this was assessed by
comparing regression coeYcients before and
after imputation
Firstly, crude associations were obtained by
linear regression of male and female suicide
rates on the separate religious and socioeco-
nomic variables. Secondly, from a multiple
regression model for suicide rates containing
all religious variables, the best performing
association of suicide rates was selected for fur-
ther analysis. Thirdly, a regression was speci-
fied for suicide rates with the five socioeco-
nomic confounders only as covariates. Using
this model's coeYcients, a summary con-
founder index was calculated for each
country.33 Fourthly, associations of suicide
rates with the best performing religious vari-
able were adjusted for confounding, by con-
trolling for the five separate socioeconomic
variables jointly, and by using the summary
confounder score instead. Finally, F tests for
interaction were used to assess whether asso-
ciations of suicide rates with the religious vari-
able diVered between age groups and between
countries scoring above and below the median
for the religious variable.
Results
Negative associations were apparent between
suicide rates and all four religious variables,
most pronounced for religiosity and weakest
for attendance and stronger for women and the
elderly than for men and the young. Religiosity
was selected for further analysis as this variable
only contributed significantly to sex specific
multiple regressions containing all religious
variables (table 1).

Higher levels of enrolment in tertiary educa-
tion, income levels, and divorce rates and lower
unemployment rates were associations of
higher suicide rates but none of them signifi-
cantly so. Higher birth rates were associated
with lower suicide rates but more so for women
than men. Similarly, associations of suicide
rates with the summary confounder index,
capturing information on all five confounders,
were stronger with female than male suicide
rates. Size and statistical significance of these
associations were hardly aVected by missing
value imputation or by weighting for WVS
sample sizes (table 1).
Full adjustment using the separate socioeco-
nomic indices removed the association of
religiosity with male but not female suicide
rates. For both sexes, the link between religios-
ity and suicide rates depended on age irrespec-
tive of adjustment for socioeconomic con-
founding. Modification of the suicide-
religiosity association on the type of country
analysed (countries with low versus those with
high levels of religiosity respectively) was
apparent after adjustment for socioeconomic
variation but for men only (F value for interac-
tion = 5.6 (df 1,25); p=0.026) (table 2) so that,
for them, a negative ecological association
between religiosity and suicide rates was
apparent in the less but not in the more
religious countries (fig 1).
Adjusted for socioeconomic variation, nega-
tive associations between suicide rates and
religiosity were most pronounced for the
elderly and women and, for men, apparent in
the 13 least religious countries only (table 3).

Suicide and religion in 26 countries 207
Discussion
Consistent with existing evidence,2 6 7 9­13 there
were strong negative linear associations be-
tween aggregate levels of religion and suicide
rates. These were stronger for women and the
elderly than for men and the young, and largely
attributable to confounding by socioeconomic
variation. The complete removal of the overall
association of male suicide rates with religiosity
after adjustment for confounding is probably
attributable to the extent to which socioeco-
nomic diVerences were controlled for, no
previous studies having adjusted for five diVer-
ent potential confounders simultaneously.
Despite absence of an overall adjusted
association between religiosity and male sui-
cide rates, stratification of the sample accord-
ing to exposure levels revealed contrasting pat-
terns in the two subsamples with negative
associations in the least and positive (although
not significantly so) ones in the more religious
nations. Ecological eVect modification is the
most likely explanation for this but other possi-
bilities need consideration. Ecological
confounding--that is, variation of suicide rates
between countries for reasons unrelated to
religiosity--may also aVect the slope of the
regression line. When confounding is present
alongside eVect modification, the net eVect
may be to increase curvilinearity, or to decrease
or even obscure it. However, the variation of
regression coeYcients for male suicide is
unlikely to be attributable to residual con-
founding for the following reasons. Adjustment
was not limited to one or two confounders but
based on five separate indicators obtained from
diVerent sources. Secondly, by using a multi-
variate summary confounder score the prob-
lem of controlling for many confounders
simultaneously was alleviated and adjustment
therefore likely to have been more eYcient,
especially in the age stratified analyses based on
small numbers of rates.33
The possibility also has to be considered that
"overadjustment" may, artificially, introduce
curvilinearity. However, this is unlikely to
account for the curved shape of adjusted
regression line for male suicide rates because
analyses using the summary confounder score
(constraining the association between suicide
rates and confounders to be on a straight line)
were similar to those using the separate
confounders. In ecological studies, lacking data
on individual exposure status, there can be no
complete certainty about whether or not
confounding is adequately controlled for.
Some may argue that other variables, such as
alcohol consumption levels8 should have been
included while others may consider it inappro-
priate to adjust for variables such as divorce or
birth rates, which may be intermediaries
between religion and suicide. Within the
constraints of these analytical imponderables,
the most convincing support for ecological
eVect modification as the responsible mech-
anism for the curved regression line for male
suicide rates derives from its good fit with other
evidence. A similar curvilinearity has been
demonstrated, independently, for the same
association across Dutch provinces where
socioeconomic diVerences are small and un-
likely to aVect the slope of the regression line.23
The association between suicide acceptability
and religiosity in men, but not women, is
modified by levels of religiosity in respondents'
countries providing direct evidence of eVect
modification taking place between the variable
under study here and an individual level proxy
for suicidal behaviour.22
This study certainly has limitations. The
outcome variable, oYcially recorded suicide, is
subject to reporting biases that may relate with
religion's national dominance.35 However, this
cannot account for the age and sex diVerences.
Furthermore, its eVect would be expected to be
most pronounced in the most religious
countries--in contrast with the male pattern
observed. Extrapolation from WVS samples to
entire nations depends on sampling methods
and sample sizes. Despite its scale, care was
taken in WVS to ensure unbiased
sampling29--the availability of individual sam-
pling scores enhanced the reliability of aggre-
gate values. Weighting for sample sizes did not
aVect regression coeYcients supporting the
reliability of the aggregate values. Further-
more, the ranking of countries according to
religious score is comparable to rankings pub-
lished by others who used diVerent methods.36
While the extent of missing values in WVS was
small, proportions of missing socioeconomic
scores were high for some countries whose
summary scores had to be imputed using non-
missing values. However, this hardly aVected
regression coeYcients so that resulting bias is
unlikely. To facilitate comparison of eVect size
for diVerent independent variables, these were
standardised. Although the use of standardised
regression coeYcients has been criticised,37
their use in the present analysis is valid as the
standard deviations used to obtain the stand-
ardised measures apply all to the same sample.
Moreover, analytical decisions were based, not
on the size of regression coeYcients, but on
measures of statistical significance that are
unaVected by standardisation.
KEY POINTS
x Ecological research that does not con-
sider ecological eVect modification and
cross cultural variation of relative risks,
may yield uninterpretable results.
x The prevalence of religiosity modifies the
strength of its own ecological association
with male, but not female suicide rates
across 26 countries.
x Especially where psychosocial variables
are concerned, the exposure's prevalence
is likely to aVect the slope of ecological
regression lines.
x At the micro-level, this may manifest itself
as dependence of risk in exposed people
on the exposure's prevalence locally.
x Relative risks in psychiatric epidemiology
have little meaning outside the study
groups in which they were originally
found to apply.

When ecological confounding and eVect
modification are not present or controlled for,
the slope of the regression line is proportional
to the relative risk or--in case of negative
regression coeYcients--relative protection.15
Given the extent of control for socioeconomic
confounding and, for the male suicide rates,
stratification of the sample by an ecological
eVect modifier, it can be argued that these con-
ditions are met so that, as indicated in figure 1,
comparable individual levels of religious belief
are a protective factor against male suicide in
less religious countries but not in more
religious ones. A variety of individual level
mechanisms may underlie this type of eVect. At
reducing prevalence of risk or protective
factors, psychological diVerences between the
exposed minority and the non-exposed major-
ity are likely to be larger because of social
selection. Minority groups may suVer margin-
alisation while, conversely, increased levels of
intragroup social support in small, close knit
groups may outweigh adverse eVects of re-
duced integration in the majority.38 Individual
level research indicates the likely relevance of
this type of contextual eVect for many psycho-
social risk factors8 18­20 22 38 and suggests that it
may aVect men more than women.21 22 39
Future multi-level studies are needed,14 to con-
firm whether male and female suicide (or other
ill health) risks given certain degrees of
exposure, relate diVerently to higher level char-
acteristics such as peer group norms and com-
munity characteristics.40
This study generates interesting hypotheses
and has theoretical implications for prevention
and research in social psychiatry. Individual
level inferences from ecological associations
have given ecological research a poor
reputation.41 However, when macro-level con-
sequences of ecological eVect modification are
considered, patterns surface with potential
public health importance. The relative impact
of reduction of risk, or increase of protective
factors, on suicide rates, will vary from
community to community. Reduction of risk
factor prevalence may lead to concentrating
risk in those, the most vulnerable, who are
beyond reach by such programmes. Relative
risks, lists of which tend to be published,42
should not be applied outside original study
populations and only be used cautiously to
estimate the likely impact of risk factor reduc-
tion on aggregate outcomes such as suicide
rates.43 Ecological eVect modification is often
considered as a methodological nuisance16 but
demonstration of its relevance for given risk
factors may guide individual level research to
explore sociocultural processes that may diVer
between the sexes and modify eVects of
exposure to risk.
