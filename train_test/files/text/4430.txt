Introduction
Thioacetamide (TAA) is a model hepatotoxic agent hav-
ing deadly effect on hepatic cells, thus leading to centri-
lobular liver cirrhosis.1 It is one of numerous agents that
provoke structural and functional changes not only in
liver, but also in other tissues such as kidney, thymus,
spleen and lungs.2 It is reasonably anticipated to be a
human carcinogen. TAA produces selective renal tubular
necrosis, restricted to that portion of the proximal convo-
luted tubule located in the inner half of the renal cortex. In
the development of TAA-induced toxicity, free radicals
are thought to play a critical role.3 Therapeutic herbs and
their principles of action have become a focus of attention
due to their anti-oxidant properties.4 Curcumin is a poly-
phenolic compound, a yellow pigment extracted from tur-
meric, from the powdered rhizome of Curcuma longa. It
is a commonly used food-stabilizing agent and spice in
the countries of Far East.5 It is renowned for its medical
properties and as a cure for several types of diseases. It
has been extensively studied for its anti-oxidant, anti-
inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and wound-healing
effects.6,7 It scavenges and prevents the formation of reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS).8 Curcumin can repress tumor
initiation, promotion and metastasis.9

Abstract
Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of curcumin on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
gene expression, oxidative stress and anti-oxidant status in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.
Materials and methods: Total 32 albino Wistar rats (male, 200­250 g) were divided into six groups (n=8). Group
1: untreated controls; Group 2: received TAA (200 mg/kg body weight (b.w.); i.p.) for 12 weeks; Group 3: received
curcumin (75 mg/kg b.w.) for 24 weeks; Group 4: received TAA (200 mg/kg b.w.; i.p.) for 12 weeks+curcumin (75 mg/
kg b.w.) for 12 weeks.
Results: A significantly higher ACE gene expression was observed in TAA-induced groups as compared with control,
indicating more synthesis of ACE proteins. Treatment with curcumin suppressed ACE expression in TAA liver and
reversed the toxicity produced. TAA treatment results in higher lipid peroxidation and lower GSH, SOD and CAT than
the normal, and this produces oxidative stress in the liver. Cirrhotic conditions were confirmed by serum enzymes (ALT,
AST and ALP) as well as histopathological observations.
Conclusion: Curcumin treatment reduced oxidative stress in animals by scavenging reactive oxygen species, protecting
the anti-oxidant enzymes from being denatured and reducing the oxidative stress marker lipid peroxidation. Curcumin
treatment restores hepatocytes, damaged by TAA, and protects liver tissue approaching cirrhosis.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), encoded by
the ACE gene, is a prime catalytic protease in the renin­
angiotensin­aldosterone system (RAAS) that converts
angiotensin (Ang) I to II.10 Raised levels of renal ACE
have been comprehensively studied in connection with the
development of cardiovascular disease in both humans and
rodents.11 Susceptibility to end-organ damage caused by
hypertension has been associated with elevated renal ACE.
In the case of TAA-induced liver cirrhosis, other parame-
ters such as oxidative stress have been postulated to be
major molecular mechanisms basic to tissue alteration.12
Based on the multifunctional properties of TAA and the
anti-oxidant properties of curcumin, this study describes
the hepatoprotective effect of curcumin on TAA-induced
liver cirrhosis, by estimating serum enzymes (alanine ami-
notransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
alkaline phosphatase (ALP)), oxidative stress (malonyldi-
aldehyde (MDA)), and anti-oxidant status (superoxide dis-
mutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH) and catalase
(CAT)) to identify ACE gene expression in TAA-induced
hepatotoxicity and its possible treatment with curcumin.
Materials and methods
Animals and diet
For this study, 32 male albino rats (Wistar strain) with
body weights ranging from 200­250 g were obtained from
the animal facility of ICCBS, University of Karachi. These
animals were housed in a polypropylene cage and the tem-
perature of the animal room was maintained at 30°C and at
50% humidity with an alternative 12 hours light/dark
cycle. The animals were provided with standard food and
water.
Study design
The experimental period of the study was 24 weeks. Rats
were divided into four groups (n=8) and were treated as
follows:
Group 1: The control group remained untreated.
Group 2: Received TAA (200 mg/kg body weight
(b.w.) intraperitoneal (i.p.)) for 12 weeks.
Group 3: Received curcumin orally (75 mg/kg b.w.)
for 24 weeks.
Group 4: Received TAA (200 mg/kg b.w.; i.p.) for 12
weeks+curcumin orally (75 mg/kg b.w.) for a further 12
weeks.
Sample collection
At the end of the treatment, the rats were decapitated to
collect the blood from the head wound. A portion of blood
was taken in a separate tube to collect serum. Liver tissues
were excised and trimmed, followed by rinsing with deion-
ized water to eliminate blood contamination. Filter paper
was used to dry the tissues, which were weighed and kept
in -70°C freezer until analyzed.
Histological examination
After quick removal, the liver tissues were cut into small
pieces, followed by immersion in neutral buffered forma-
lin (10%) for 24 hours. Standard histological techniques
were used to fix and section the liver tissues. The morpho-
logical changes in the fixed sections of the liver tissues
stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) were used
to evaluate the extent of TAA-induced necrosis.13
Preparation of post-mitochondrial supernatant
A tissue homogenizer (Ultraturrax T-25 Polytron) was
used to obtain liver homogenates at 4°C. To prepare the
liver homogenates (1:10 w/v), 5 mM KCl buffer (pH 7.8)
containing EDTA 0.3 mM was used followed by centrifu-
gation at 800 g for 5 min at 4°C to separate the nuclear
debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,500 g
for 20 min at 4°C to obtain post-mitochondrial superna-
tants used for analyses of SOD, CAT, MDA and GSH.14
Assessment of serum enzymes and bilirubin
The estimations ALP, AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin
in serum was done using reagent kits from Randox
Laboratories Ltd., UK.
Assessment of oxidative stress
As a measure of lipid peroxidation, MDA content was ana-
lyzed by means of thiobarbituric acid reacting substance
(TBARS) using tissue homogenate.15
Assessment of anti-oxidant status
Previously established methods were used to measure the
level of SOD,16 GSH17 and CAT activity18 in the cell-free
supernatant.
ACE gene expression
Expression of the ACE gene in liver tissue was assessed
using the quantitative RT-PCR method. RNA was isolated
using entire RNA Prep Plus. Amplification reaction was
performed in 12.5 µl total volume, containing a pair of spe-
cific primers: 5'CAGCTTCATCATCCAGTTCC3' and
5'CTAGGAAGAGCAGCACCCAC. PCR consisted of 30
cycles at an annealing temperature of 52­64°C. Restriction
fragments were subsequently analyzed in 2% agarose gel
stained with ethidium bromide.19

Statistical analysis
All the data values are given in Mean±SEM. Statistical
software package SPSS for Windows® version 17.0 was
used for statistical analyses. One-way ANOVA was per-
formed followed by Student's t-test to evaluate variations
in data; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The hepatocytes, portal triads and vasculature were found
to be within normal limits during histopathological
assessments. There was no pathological modification
such as inflammation, necrosis and/or fibrosis in the liver
of curcumin-treated animals (Figure 1). A massive fatty
change along with centrilobular necrotic shift was observed
in the liver of TAA-treated rats. Apoptosis (single hepatic
cell necrosis) was also very clearly observed, as well as
mononuclear cells infiltration, mostly macrophages and
lymphocytes, around central veins and in portal areas in
TAA-treated animals (green arrow). The liver section
showed extensive damage, characterized by severe necro-
sis, fatty degeneration, sinusoidal dilatation, and the pres-
ence of collagen bundles surrounding the lobules leading
to thick fibrotic septae that disrupt the cellular architecture
(Figure 2). A complete regeneration of hepatocytes and
hepatic tissues appeared in most of the cases in curcumin +
TAA-treated animals (Figure 3).
The levels of AST, ALT and ALP were estimated in
serum to detect any possible deviations from normal in
liver functions (Table 1). The liver-specific enzymes were
found to be markedly affected in the group treated with
TAA. Significantly higher (p<0.05) levels of serum AST,
ALT and ALP in TAA-treated rats suggested elevations in
the release of the enzymes due to serious damage in the
liver. However, a significantly lower (p<0.05) level was
observed for these enzymes in the study group treated with
TAA+curcumin compared with the TAA-treated group.
Activity of the anti-oxidant enzyme SOD activity was
significantly lower (p<0.05) in TAA-treated cirrhotic
rats, whereas no significant difference was observed in
curcumin-treated cirrhotic rats as compared with con-
trols. CAT activity was found to be significantly lower
(p<0.05) in TAA-treated cirrhotic rats. No significant
change was observed in the level of CAT in curcumin-
treated and TAA-treated cirrhotic rats as compared with
controls (Table 2).
Tissue MDA as a measure of tissue lipid peroxidation
was found to be significantly higher (p<0.05) in TAA-
treated cirrhotic and curcumin-treated cirrhotic rats as
compared with controls (Table 2). ACE gene expression in
the study groups is shown in Figure 4, which was signifi-
cantly higher (p<0.05) after 8 weeks of TAA treatment in
cirrhotic rats as compared with the control group. This
gene expression was found to be reversed in the curcumin-
treated cirrhotic rats (Figure 4).
Discussion
In order to understand the underlying mechanisms involved
in the development of cirrhosis, the present study inspected
the role of oxidative stress in the mediation of hepatic

injury. The TAA-induced cirrhosis resulted in oxidative
stress in the liver, as observed by a high level of lipid per-
oxidation, accompanied by distorted status of antioxidants.
In end-stage liver cirrhosis, organ failure has been observed
due to severe renal vasoconstriction, which frequently
develops in patients with cirrhosis.20,21
Even though the exact molecular mechanisms by which
TAA induces toxic effects in different organs is not under-
stood, it is well known that TAA interferes with ribosomal
activity, thereby interfering with protein synthesis and
stimulating DNA synthesis.22
The present study aimed to determine the expression
of the ACE gene in rats suffering from TAA toxicity and
their treatment with curcumin, and compare their levels
with control groups by using the quantitative RT-PCR
method. ACE gene expression was significantly raised in
the TAA group as compared with the control group, indi-
cating that TAA induced changes in the ACE gene, pro-
ducing more ACE protein than would the normal gene.
Furthermore, high activity of the RAAS causes hepatic
scarring and decreases the number of functioning hepato-
cytes.23 This increase in ACE gene expression was over-
come in the experimental animals who received curcumin
after TAA; hence, they seemed to be protected against
abnormally increased levels of ACE in the liver caused
by TAA.24,25
The boost in lipid peroxidation and generation of ROS
may diminish cell viability. TAA-induced lipid peroxida-
tion is reported to disturb the reliability of the membrane,
leading to inhibition of membrane-bound enzymes. Higher
levels of lipid peroxidation have also been observed in rat
liver exposed to TAA. A significant decline in lipid peroxi-
dation caused by administration of antioxidants was found
after the treatment with curcumin; therefore, it can be said
that the curcumin restrained the production of ROS, which
has been shown to decrease lipid peroxidation possibly by
its anti-oxidant mechanism.26
SOD is a metalloprotein widely distributed in all cells
and plays a significant role in protecting against oxidative
damage induced by ROS. Reduced SOD levels may pos-
sibly be due to the generation of more superoxide anions.
Higher levels of production of H2
O2
lowered the activity
of CAT.27 The activity of CAT was found to be signifi-
cantly lower (p<0.005) in TAA-treated rats as compared
with the control group, and after treatment with curcumin
CAT activity was found to be significantly reducing the
effects of TAA in liver.

The non-enzymatic anti-oxidant GSH is thought to be
a key player in the process of detoxification, which
actively participates in reactions which lead to the destruc-
tion of H2
O2
, free radicals, and certain foreign com-
pounds.28,29 The higher consumption of GSH to scavenge
the toxic intermediates formed by TAA led to significantly
lower levels of GSH in liver tissue of the TAA group. On
the other hand, a significant rise in GSH level was
observed following the administration of curcumin to
TAA-induced liver.
Significantly higherACE gene expression was observed
in the TAA-induced group when compared with controls,
indicating that more ACE proteins are being formed. It
seems that treatment with curcumin increases ACE gene
expression in liver as compared with the TAA-induced tis-
sue, approaching normal levels.
Conclusion
It may be concluded from the findings of this study that
curcumin administration may produce a defensive effect
against TAA-induced liver injury and oxidative stress in
rats, which otherwise leads to liver cirrhosis. Further
long-term follow-up studies may be of great benefit to
understand and to establish the hepatoprotective nature
of curcumin administration in the animals under
observation.
