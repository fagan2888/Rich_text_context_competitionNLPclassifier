DataWatch
Excess Cost Of Emergency Department Visits For Nonurgent Care
by Laurence C. Baker and Linda Schuurman Baker
Abstract: After examining data for patients with selected conditions and statistically adjusting for
patient, diagnosis, and treatment characteristics, this DataWatch finds that charges for emergency
department visits were two to three times more than charges for visits in other settings. Large
differences persist when conditions are examined individually and when total episode charges are
examined. Based on our findings, a rough estimate of nationwide excess charges is $5-$7 billion for
1993.
Significant attention has been paid in recent years to persons who use
the emergency departments of the nation's hospitals for their primary
care. The fact that many patients obtain nonurgent care in emergency
departments has been well documented.1 In fact, according to the National
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, more than half of the 89.8 million
emergency department visits made in 1992 were for nonurgent care.2 Such
use of expensive emergency services is often pointed to as a source of excess
health spending. It has been argued that significant savings, as well as
increased quality of care, could be achieved ifthese patients used appropriate
sources of care. However, although some "back-of-the-envelope" estimates
of the ratio of emergency department to non-emergency department costs
have been generated over the past fifteen years, broad-based, careful esti-
mates of the excess cost of these visits have not been available.4 In this
DataWatch we use data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure
Survey (NMES) to study the difference between the charge for an emergency
department visit and the charge for a visit to another setting for patients
with several conditions that are not likely to require urgent attention.
Data And Methods
Data sources. We use data from the 1987 NMES household survey file,
the ambulatory visit file, and the health status questionnaire.5 NMES is a

national survey of roughly 35,000 persons in 4,000 U.S. households. Survey
items cover health expenditures by or on behalf of families and individuals,
the financing of those expenditures, and each person's use of health care
services. In the ambulatory care supplement, data are collected from per-
sons on all contacts with the ambulatory medical care system, including
visits to medical provider offices, hospital outpatient units, and emergency
departments. Total charges for each visit, procedures performed, and payers
for the visit also are included. The household survey file provides basic
demographics (age, race, sex, income, and so on), and the health status
questionnaire provides information on medical conditions, self-perceived
health status, and other health-related variables.
The key variable of interest here is visit charges. This variable represents
actual charges for the services performed, except when charges were re-
duced to amounts allowed by third-party payers. In these cases, the data
contained the reduced amount.6 Since NMES expresses charges in 1987
dollars, the values we present are also in 1987 dollars, except where noted.
Construction and selection of episodes. We examined charges for
visits and episodes of care. Episodes were constructed from the NMES visit
file by grouping visits made by an individual to any provider for the same
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis
code. Sequences of visits occurring before a break in service of four months
or more were considered to be in the same episode.7
We identified a sample of episodes for analysis using a three-step process.
First, we included only episodes for a select set of conditions that are not
expected to often require urgent care. NMES provides the ICD-9 code for
the patient's condition. Because coding is retrospective and may not cap-
ture all available information, the selection of codes to be designated as
nonurgent is difficult. Although previous literature on nonurgent care in
emergency departments has not often used the ICD-9 codes as the basis of
categorization, one retrospective chart review did incorporate diagnosis.8
Here, a number of conditions were considered nonurgent, including super-
ficial injuries, uncomplicated fractures of any digit or metacarpal, pharyngi-
tis (sore throat), upper respiratory tract infections, and gastroenteritis.9 We
included episodes for the treatment of these conditions along with the
treatment of skin disorders (for example, diaper rash, eczema, corns, cal-
louses, and ingrown nails), head- and backaches, and miscellaneous symp-
toms (for example, conjunctivitis, earwax, hiccoughs, and heartburn).10
Second, since our estimates of charge differences may be biased if the
illnesses or injuries treated in emergency departments are more severe than
those treated in the offices of medical providers, we excluded from consid-
eration episodes with characteristics that we expect to be correlated with
higher severity. Specifically, we excluded episodes for which the patient

had visits in which he or she arrived in the emergency room by ambulance,
received stitches, was subsequently admitted to the hospital, had more than
fifteen visits in the episode, or was diagnosed with more than one condi-
tion. Episodes related to pregnancy also were excluded.
Finally, since NMES only includes visits that occurred during 1987, our
data on episodes that actually began in late 1986 would be inaccurate. We
therefore excluded from our analysis of first visit charges all episodes begin-
ning before March 1987 for which the first visit was to the office of a
medical provider. Examination of the distribution of episodes indicated
that episodes for which the first visit was to an emergency department are
not likely to be censored. In all, after excluding episodes with missing data,
our sample consisted of 3,305 episodes beginning in non-emergency de-
partment settings and 779 episodes beginning in an emergency department.
We used only condition and severity in the selection process, excluding
information related to visit appropriateness (for example, day of the week).
We do not wish to consider access issues here, but rather to compare costs
with those that would be incurred if all nonurgent cases were cared for in
non-emergency department settings.
Our sample of emergency department-initiated episodes is about 10
percent of the total number of emergency department-initiated episodes
constructed from the NMES visit file, much fewer than the 50 percent of
emergency department visits that are widely agreed to be nonurgent. In
constructing our sample, we considered including episodes for treatment of
additional conditions so that the number of episodes in our sample might be
closer to 50 percent. However, since we must rely on ICD-9 codes to
identify episodes, including additional categories would have exacerbated
the potential for differences in severity to bias our findings. For example, we
could have included lacerations, since some lacerations are nonurgent, but
in so doing, we might also have included truly urgent lacerations that are
also more likely to present in an emergency department. This would have
made it more difficult to compare charges. Faced with this trade-off, we
chose the set of conditions discussed above in hopes of examining a range
of conditions while minimizing the risk of improper comparisons.
Methods. We examined charges for visits and for episodes of care,
focusing on the mean charge for emergency department and non-
emergency department visits and, in the case of episodes, on the mean
charge for episodes that were initiated in the two settings.
To control for variation in patient characteristics and injury severity, we
used regression adjustment techniques. Conceptually, these techniques use
the experiences of patients who went to a non-emergency department
provider to predict what the patients in our emergency department sample
would have been charged for their visits if they had gone to other providers

instead. To implement the procedure, we used ordinary least squares to
regress the first visit charges incurred by patients in the non-emergency
department sample on an extensive set of variables describing the charac-
teristics of their visits (condition, treatments received, source of payment,
total number of visits in the episode), health status, health insurance status,
regular source of health care, and demographic characteristics.11 In some
regressions we also controlled for medical history. We then used the regres-
sion results to predict the charges that would have been incurred by the
emergency department patients if they had gone elsewhere. Using the
projected charges, we can examine the difference between the charges for
care in the different settings by looking at the difference between the
amount that the emergency department sample was actually charged and
their projected non-emergency department charge.
Note that in the regression analysis, we control for the number and types
of treatments received. This may cause us to understate the true underlying
charge difference, since treatment difference may reflect differences in
practice style. However, treatment difference also may reflect differences in
severity. Including treatment in the regression will yield conservative esti-
mates of charge differences.
Study Results
First visit charges. We examined differences in the charges for first
visits in emergency department and other settings (Exhibit 1). We focus on
first visits since they are likely to have similar content in both settings,
while visits at other points in an episode may differ. The first two columns
present the distribution of the episodes over condition types. The last three
columns present the unadjusted mean charge for the first visit from episodes
beginning in various settings. All charges are presented in 1987 dollars,
except where noted. The differences are striking. Overall, the mean first
visit charge in a non-emergency department setting is $43, while the mean
first visit charge in an emergency department is $144. Large differences
between the two settings persist within the condition categories. In all
cases, the differences are highly statistically significant.
Regression-adjusted estimates of mean charges for first visits are pre-
sented in the top section of Exhibit 2. The first column presents the actual
mean charge for emergency department patients; the second column pre-
sents the charge we project that these patients would have incurred with a
non-emergency department provider. For all condition categories com-
bined, the projected non-emergency department charge is $50, while the
actual charge of $144 was nearly three times higher. For conditions exam-
ined separately, large differences also persist. The actual emergency depart-

ment charges are about three times the projected non-emergency depart-
ment charges. Episodes for the treatment of fractures and gastroenteritis
were not separately examined since there were too few visits to permit
reliable regression analysis.
Although we carefully selected the episodes analyzed here to minimize
the possibility that severity bias would cloud our analysis, it is possible to
make additional exclusions from the sample to reduce this risk even further.
In doing so, however, we run the opposite risk of removing cases that
should be examined--those for which no severity bias exists. Nonetheless,
to provide a conservative estimate of the difference, the bottom section of
Exhibit 2 presents actual and projected emergency department charges for
a subset of our original sample that excludes episodes in which patients
received x-rays, scans, or surgical procedures. As expected, the mean actual
first visit charge is notably lower in this sample than in the whole sample;
the projected charges are also lower. Since both actual and projected
charges fall by about one-third, the ratio of actual emergency department to
projected non-emergency department charges remains about the same--
emergency department visit charges were about three times as much as
non-emergency department visit charges. However, the absolute difference
is smaller in this sample than in the overall sample. For all conditions,
emergency department visit charges were about $65 more than other visit
charges. Since this sample is likely to exclude some valid episodes, we
interpret this as a conservative estimate of the charge difference.

control for patient and visit characteristics that are recorded. If there are
differences in important unrecorded patient characteristics, especially con-
dition severity, our estimates of the difference could overstate its size.
Total episode charges. When assessing the overall extent of excess
charges, it is important to consider episode charges as well as visit charges,
because episodes begun in emergency departments may differ from episodes
begun in non-emergency department settings. One important possibility is
that the length of episodes may differ. For example, if office-based providers
are more likely than emergency department providers to recommend
follow-up visits, episodes begun in a non-emergency department setting
may be longer. If this is the case, the differences observed in first visit
charges may overstate the differences in total episode charges.
To examine this issue, we first looked directly at the number of visits in
episodes. To reduce the possibility of truncation at the end of the NMES
sample period, we examined only episodes that ended in or before October
1987. Thus, the sample used here is somewhat smaller than that used
above. Exhibit 3 presents the mean number of visits in episodes that began
in the two settings. Contrary to expectation, episodes beginning in emer-

bottom section use a conservative sample in which only episodes having no
x-rays, scans, or surgical procedures are used. Taking all conditions to-
gether, the average emergency department-initiated episode charge was
$174, while we project that these episodes would have cost one-third as
much, about $63 per episode, if they had begun in another setting. Actual
and projected charges for specific conditions also are presented in Exhibit
4. In general, emergency department-initiated episode charges were two to
three times more than those for episodes initiated outside an emergency
department. Estimates based on the restricted sample are similar, although,
as before, the absolute size of the differences is smaller.
Estimates of excess charges. Using these results, it is possible to con-
struct rough estimates of the overall excess charges associated with the use
of emergency departments for nonurgent care. About 89.8 million emer-
gency department visits took place in 1992.13 In our analysis of the NMES
data, we found that 10 percent of the emergency department-initiated
episodes of care were for the treatment of the narrow set of nonurgent
conditions on which we focused. We thus suspect that about 10 percent of
the 89.8 million emergency department visits, or 8.98 million visits, were
for the treatment of these conditions. Applying the per visit charge differ-
ential we obtained earlier ($93.85, see Exhibit 2) to these visits, we esti-
mate that the nationwide excess charges for the treatment of only our
narrow set of conditions were about $840 million in 1987 dollars and,
accounting for inflation in medical costs using the medical Consumer Price
Index (CPI), about $1.3 billion in 1993 dollars.
Two assumptions underlie these estimates. First, we assume that we have
accurately estimated the charge differences for the conditions that we
examined. Although we may have overestimated this difference by failing
to completely control for severity or other unobserved factors, we hope to
have minimized this problem by carefully selecting the episodes examined
and by using extensive controls in our regression analysis. The second
assumption is that the first visit charge difference is representative of charge
differences for other (for example, second) visits. We suspect that this is the
case since our analysis of total episode charges produced results similar to
those from the first visit analysis.
However, $1.3 billion may be a significant understatement of nationwide
excess charges for the treatment of all nonurgent emergency department
cases. One recent estimate indicated that 55.4 percent of 1992 emergency
department visits, or 49.7 million visits, were nonurgent.14 Under the
assumption that the excess charge estimate we derived from the analysis of
our set of conditions is applicable to all nonurgent emergency department
visits, a rough estimate of overall excess charges is $7.2 billion in 1993
dollars.15 Unfortunately, we cannot assess the extent to which our findings

170 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Winter 1994
may be extrapolated to the broader set of nonurgent emergency department
conditions. Because $7.2 billion could be an overestimate, we have com-
puted a more conservative estimate by applying the estimated charge differ-
ence obtained from our conservative restricted sample ($65.26, see Exhibit
2). Here, we find estimated excess charges of $5 billion in 1993 dollars.
Policy Implications
These are rough estimates. But even these rough calculations suggest that
there are significant excess expenditures associated with the use of emer-
gency departments for nonurgent care. They also suggest that policies that
make alternative, less expensive sources of care available to patients and
that encourage patients to use such facilities may achieve savings. Such
policies would have to address patients' incentives and knowledge regard-
ing appropriate sources of care. It is important to note, however, that it may
still be difficult to achieve all of these savings. Emergency departments
probably have substantial fixed costs, which may be difficult to reduce
without shutting facilities down. If our estimates of excess charges do not
represent excess variable costs, they may not represent achievable savings.
There are also significant access issues to be surmounted. In some places
and at some times there may be no alternative sources of care available.

11. The log of charges is the dependent variable since it gave a better regression fit than
the untransformed charges. Predicted charges were converted from logarithmic form
using both standard estimators and a smearing estimator suggested. See N. Duan,
"Smearing Estimate: A Nonparametric Retransformation Method," Journal of the
American Statistical Association 78 (1983): 605-610. The different estimators gave
highly similar results; estimates based on the standard estimator are presented. We also
experimented with reduced sets of independent variables and found that, where there
were differences, the results we present are the smaller (more conservative) estimates.
Details of the regression analysis are available from the authors upon request.
12. These estimates do not include the total number of visits in the episode as a control
variable. Inclusion of this variable would control for difference in episode length that
should be left as part of the difference we examined.

15. $93.85 x 49.7 million visits = $4.7 billion (1987 dollars). The medical CPI indicates
54.8 percent cost growth between 1987 and 1993. We get $4.7 billion x 1.548 = $7.2
billion (1993 dollars).
