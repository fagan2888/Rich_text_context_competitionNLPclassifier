African-American children have lower lung volumes than White children. However, the contributions of
anthropometric, socioeconomic, nutritional, and environmental factors to this difference are unknown. From
participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994), the authors selected
1,462 healthy nonsmoking children (623 White and 839 African-American) aged 8­17 years. The African-
American children were taller and heavier but had lower lung function. African Americans were poorer and had
lower levels of the antioxidant vitamins A and C and -carotene. The authors performed regression analyses
using data on anthropometric, socioeconomic, and nutritional factors and smoke exposure. Adjustment for sitting
height explained 42­53% of the racial difference. Socioeconomic factors and antioxidant vitamin levels
accounted for an additional 7­10%. Overall, the authors could account for only 50­63% of the racial difference.
Exposure to tobacco in the home was weakly associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second in girls,
accounting for 1% of the difference. In children aged 8­12 years (n = 752), birth weight explained 3­5% of the
racial difference, whereas in-utero exposure to maternal smoking had no significant effect. The authors conclude
that in healthy children, the major explanatory variable for the racial difference in lung function is body habitus;
socioeconomic, nutritional, and environmental confounders play a smaller role.

A difference in pulmonary function between Whites and
African Americans has been found in both children and
adults (1­5). Hsi et al. (2) reported that the racial difference
in spirometric lung volume between African-American and
White children could be completely accounted for by the
smaller trunk:leg ratio of African Americans. However, race
is confounded by other factors that are associated with lower
lung function, including lower socioeconomic status (6, 7),
obesity (8, 9), lower dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins
(10­13), low birth weight (14, 15), and exposure to tobacco
smoke (16­18).
Recently, we reported that the use of sitting height instead
of standing height in adult data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
reduced the racial difference in lung volume between asymp-
tomatic Whites and African Americans by 35­39 percent
(19). Smaller proportions of the racial difference were
explained by differences in poverty, education, and body
mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2). Overall, we could
account for only half of the racial difference in forced expi-
ratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
) and forced vital capacity
(FVC).
Poverty, nutrition, and exposure to tobacco smoke may
affect lung development. Thus, these factors may be more
proximate determinants of lung function in children than in
adults. For this reason, we undertook to study factors that
might contribute to the racial difference in pulmonary func-
tion in children. Using the same nationally representative
data set, we attempted to determine whether the racial differ-
ence between healthy asymptomatic African-American chil-

dren and White children could be explained by
anthropometric, socioeconomic, nutritional, and/or environ-
mental factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study group
The study subjects were children and teenage participants
in NHANES III, a survey of the US noninstitutionalized
population conducted between 1988 and 1994 by the
National Center for Health Statistics. The survey consisted
of several questionnaires followed by physical examination
and laboratory testing that included spirometry. Details on
the survey design and examination procedures have been
published by the National Center for Health Statistics (20,
21). In this study, we applied the criteria of Hankinson et al.
(5) to select asymptomatic, nonsmoking White or African-
American children ranging in age from 8 years to 17 years.
Of 4,140 children who performed spirometry, 623 Whites
and 839 African Americans met the Hankinson et al. (5)
criteria for healthy children and had complete records for the
relevant data (spirometric, anthropometric, and socioeco-
nomic factors, smoking, and serum levels of antioxidant
vitamins). To investigate the effect of low birth weight and
maternal smoking on lung function in general and on the
racial difference in FEV1
and FVC specifically, we analyzed
younger subsets of girls and boys (383 girls and 369 boys)
with available information on birth weight. The children in
these subsets ranged in age from 8 years to 12 years.
Spirometry
Spirometric measurements were obtained as previously
described (5, 21). In this study, we analyzed data from
sessions in which at least two acceptable maneuvers had
been performed. We used the reference equations derived by
Hankinson et al. (5) to calculate the predicted values for
spirometric indices.
Statistical analyses
Cross-sectional analysis of the data was conducted with
SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
Multivariable regression analysis was performed separately
by gender, with FEV1
or FVC as the dependent variable.
Independent variables included age, sitting or standing
height, race, educational level of the family head, and
poverty index. The poverty index is defined as the ratio of
family income in the past 12 months to the federal poverty
line, such that a higher poverty index is indicative of a higher
socioeconomic status. To test the effects of environmental
tobacco smoke exposure and serum antioxidant levels, we
added separately to the above regression model each of the
following variables: tobacco smoke exposure at home (1 =
the presence of at least one cigarette smoker in the house-
hold; 0 = no smokers in the household) and serum concentra-
tions of vitamins A, C, and E and - and -carotene. We also
included terms for the interactions between education of the
family head and race and between poverty index and race, in
order to assess whether socioeconomic variables affected
African Americans differently from Whites. To explore the
effect on lung function of birth weight and maternal smoking
during pregnancy, we performed regression analyses in the
younger subsets of the study population for children with
complete information on these variables. We applied
Student's t test by gender to check the significance of the
racial difference in potentially explanatory variables
between African Americans and Whites. Regression coeffi-
cients and the results of t tests were considered significant at
p = 0.05. Reduction in the racial difference was calculated as
1 ­ (adjusted /SH-adjusted ), where "adjusted " is the
adjusted racial difference obtained when the specified vari-
ables were included in the model and "SH-adjusted " is the
adjusted racial difference obtained when standing height was
used in the model.
To determine whether the residual racial difference was
the result of covariate selection, we performed regression
analyses using all candidate variables. The residual racial
differences for the full model were compared with the differ-
ences for the parsimonious model.
RESULTS
Study population
The numbers of children who were excluded from the
study population for various reasons are shown in table 1.
The greatest number of exclusions from the combined set of
African Americans and Whites (n = 2,306) was due to
doctors' diagnoses of asthma (n = 238). This gave us a final
study group of 623 Whites (320 girls and 303 boys) and 839
African Americans (452 girls and 387 boys). Except for the
last three exclusions, the study group was similar to the
population used by Hankinson et al. (5) to derive the race-
and gender-specific spirometric reference equations. Table 2
presents the subjects' characteristics by gender and race.
Girls and boys of both races were similar in age (mean ages
were 12.2 years for girls and 12.0 years for boys). African
Americans of both sexes were taller, had lower FEV1
and
FVC values, had more exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke at home, and came from families with heads that were
poorer, less educated, and more likely to be unemployed.
Table 2 shows that in comparison with Whites, serum levels
of vitamin A, vitamin C, and -carotene were lower in
African Americans of both sexes. When compared with
Whites, the African-American girls had a higher body mass
index, and the African-American boys had a higher FEV1
:
FVC ratio.
Effect of anthropometric, socioeconomic, and
nutritional factors
In regression analysis, terms for the interaction between
family-head education and race and the interaction between
poverty index and race were not significant in either girls or
boys, indicating that these socioeconomic variables affected
FEV1
and FVC similarly in both racial groups. For this
reason, we combined the White and African-American chil-
Racial Difference in Lung Function 895

dren by gender to study the main effects of socioeconomic
status on the racial difference in lung function.
Tables 3 and 4 show the results of regression analyses
performed to determine the effect of including sitting height,
socioeconomic variables, and serum levels of antioxidant
vitamins on the racial difference in lung function in girls and
boys. When age, standing height, and race were entered into
the regression model, the racial difference in FEV1
between
White and African-American subjects was 356 ml in girls
and 364 ml in boys (table 3). Adjusting for sitting height
instead of standing height reduced the racial difference to
203 ml (43 percent reduction) in girls and 170 ml (53
percent reduction) in boys. In girls, the most significant
socioeconomic variable that was found to affect lung func-
tion was the educational level of the family head, whereas in
boys it was poverty index. The addition of these socioeco-
nomic variables to the respective models reduced the racial
difference further to 184 ml (48 percent reduction) in girls
and 140 ml (61 percent reduction) in boys. Of the antioxi-
dants listed in table 2, only serum -carotene in girls and
vitamin A in boys were significantly associated with FEV1
.
The subsequent inclusion of these antioxidants in the respec-
tive models further reduced the racial difference to 178 ml
(50 percent reduction) for the girls and 133 ml (63 percent
reduction) for the boys.
We also performed similar regression analyses for FVC.
When age, standing height, and race were entered into the
regression model, the racial difference in FVC between
Whites and African Americans was 416 ml in girls and 459
ml in boys (table 4). Adjusting for sitting height instead of
standing height reduced the racial difference to 240 ml (42
percent reduction) in girls and 225 ml (51 percent reduction)
in boys. The addition of socioeconomic variables reduced
the racial difference further to 224 ml (46 percent reduction)
in girls and 200 ml (56 percent reduction) in boys. The
subsequent inclusion of serum antioxidants (vitamin A and
-carotene for girls; vitamin A for boys) further reduced the
racial difference to 208 ml (50 percent reduction) for the
girls and 195 ml (58 percent reduction) for the boys.
To determine whether other socioeconomic variables had
any effect on FEV1
and FVC, we added to the regression
models the socioeconomic and nutritional variables listed in
table 1 for which data were available on all subjects (table 5).
These full models showed that including a larger set of
socioeconomic and nutritional variables accounted for only a
slightly larger amount of the residual racial difference.
Effect of environmental tobacco smoke exposure
The inverse association between exposure to tobacco
smoking at home and the educational attainment of the
family head was observed in each of the four gender-race
subgroups in this study. The subjects were divided by expo-
sure to tobacco smoke in the home. This yielded 450 girls
and 400 boys who came from homes with no smokers and
322 girls and 290 boys who came from homes with at least
one tobacco smoker. Values for measures of socioeconomic
status, such as poverty index, years of education of the
family head, and employment status of the family head, as
well as the proportion of Whites, were all higher in the
nonexposed subgroups for both genders.
To evaluate the contribution of the greater home exposure
to tobacco smoking in African Americans to the racial differ-
ence in lung function, we used gender-specific multivariate
regression models that adjusted for age, race, and sitting
height. Results showed that exposure to tobacco smoke at
home, as measured by the presence of at least one smoker in
the household, was weakly associated with FEV1
in the girls
(p = 0.049), reducing FEV1
by 40.7 ml but accounting for
only 4 ml (1 percent) of the FEV1
racial difference. How-
ever, in this model, the negative effect of home smoking
exposure on FEV1
became nonsignificant (p = 0.15) once
education of the family head was taken into account. There
was no effect of household smoke exposure on FVC or on the
racial difference in FVC in this group of healthy girls (p = 0.8).
Using similar regression models, we could not detect a
significant effect of home exposure to tobacco smoking on
FEV1
(p = 0.13) or FVC (p = 0.8) in this subset of asymptom-
atic healthy boys. All of the above findings led us to

function.
Effect of birth weight and maternal smoking during
pregnancy
To investigate the effect of low birth weight on lung func-
tion in general, and on explaining the racial difference in
FEV1
and FVC specifically, we analyzed subsets of healthy
children (383 girls and 369 boys) with available birth weight
information. The girls in the female subset (169 Whites and
214 African Americans) ranged in age from 8 years to 12
years (mean = 10.1 years). The mean birth weight of the
White girls was significantly higher than that of the African-
American girls (3,381 g (standard error, 41) vs. 3,200 g
(standard error, 39)). The addition of birth weight to gender-
specific regression models that adjusted for age, sitting
height, and race showed that a decrease in birth weight of
100 g was associated with reductions in FEV1
and FVC in

girls of 6.7 ml and 6.0 ml, respectively; it reduced the racial
difference in FEV1
by an additional 11.4 ml (3.7 percent) and
reduced the racial difference in FVC by 10 ml (2.9 percent).
In this subgroup of younger girls, the overall reductions in
the FEV1
and FVC racial differences after the addition of
birth weight and education were 53 percent and 55 percent,
respectively. The magnitude of the effect of birth weight on
lung function stayed essentially the same when education of
the household head was taken into account.
In this subgroup, the proportion of children exposed to
maternal smoking during pregnancy was 25 percent in
Whites and 22 percent in African Americans. However, the
difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.7). Regres-
sion analyses showed that the effects of maternal smoking
during pregnancy on FEV1
(p = 0.096) and FVC (p = 0.9)
were not significant. The weak effect on FEV1
became even
weaker when birth weight was included in the model. Thus,
it appears that in-utero exposure to maternal smoking does
not contribute to the racial difference in lung function in this
healthy subset of younger girls.
Similar analyses were conducted in the subset of 369 boys
with available information on birth weight. The 174 White
boys and 195 African-American boys ranged in age from 8
years to 12 years (mean = 10.1). The mean birth weight of
the White boys was significantly higher than that of the
African-American boys (3,503 g (standard error, 50) vs.
3,214 g (standard error, 46)). In this group of boys, the inclu-
sion of birth weight in regression models that adjusted for
age, sitting height, and race showed that a decrease in birth
weight of 100 g was accompanied by decreases of 5.3 ml and
6.4 ml in FEV1
and FVC, respectively. Birth weight further
reduced the racial difference in FEV1
by 13 ml (4.9 percent
reduction) and reduced the racial difference in FVC by 16 ml
(4.2 percent reduction). The overall reductions in the FEV1
and FVC racial differences after the addition of birth weight
and poverty index were 64 percent and 57 percent, respec-
tively. The effect of birth weight was slightly reduced when
poverty index was included in the model.
Moreover, we found in this subset that the proportion of
White boys who were exposed to maternal smoking during
pregnancy (28 percent) was significantly higher than the
proportion of African-American boys (18 percent) (p =
0.02). We did not observe any significant effect of maternal
smoking during pregnancy on FEV1
or FVC. This indicates
that, as in the girls, maternal smoking during pregnancy does
not explain the racial difference in lung volume in this
subgroup of younger healthy boys.
Additional analyses carried out in the younger cohort
using the available socioeconomic, nutritional, and smoke-
exposure variables did not reduce the racial difference in
comparison with the parsimonious model.

Racial Difference in Lung Function 899
Am J Epidemiol 2004;160:893­900
DISCUSSION
This cross-sectional study of the US population confirmed
earlier findings that African-American children have lower
lung volumes than White children (1, 2). After adjusting for
anthropometric, socioeconomic, and nutritional variables,
we could account for only 50 percent of the racial differences
in FEV1
and FVC among girls; we were able to account for
63 percent of the racial difference in FEV1
and 58 percent of
the racial difference in FVC among boys. As in the adults
from the same nationally representative study (19), the major
source of difference was anthropometric, namely the lower
trunk:leg ratio of African Americans as compared with
Whites. Substituting sitting height for standing height
reduced the racial difference in FEV1
by 43 percent in girls
and 53 percent in boys and reduced the racial difference in
FVC by 42 percent in girls and 51 percent in boys. Although
this reduction was larger than that observed in NHANES III
adults (19) and in a group of healthy nonsmoking African
Americans and Whites aged 6­24 years (3), it was smaller
than that reported by Hsi et al. (2), who found that the use of
sitting height in children could account for most of the racial
difference in lung volume. Presumably, sitting height more
closely corresponds to the size of the thorax than standing
height.
As in our study of the NHANES III adults (19), socioeco-
nomic variables explained smaller amounts of the racial
difference in lung volume between African-American and
White children. Adjustment for education of the family head
as a surrogate for socioeconomic status reduced FEV1
and
FVC by 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in girls. In
boys, poverty index but not education of the family head
influenced lung function, reducing the racial difference in
FEV1
by 8 percent and reducing the racial difference in FVC
by 5 percent.
We also considered the effect of the major antioxidant
vitamins previously shown to influence lung function (12,
13). Of these antioxidants, serum vitamin A and -carotene
were significantly associated with lung function and were
also lower in African Americans in this study group (table
2). The latter finding is consistent with the report by
Patterson et al. (22) that African Americans have lower
consumption of fruits and vegetables than Whites. However,
the addition of these antioxidants to the gender-specific
models explained only 1­4 percent of the racial difference in
lung function. It is notable that the association of the socio-
economic variables with lung function was reduced when the
above antioxidants were included in the model. This
suggests that low serum levels of antioxidant vitamins may
partially explain the negative effect of low socioeconomic
status on lung function.
In this group of healthy children, home exposure to
tobacco smoking, as measured by the presence of at least one
smoker in the household, was more common in African
Americans and was weakly associated with FEV1
only in
girls. This is consistent with some other reports that females
are more susceptible to tobacco smoke exposure than are
males (7, 23). However, this negative effect, which
explained very little of the racial difference in FEV1
(1
percent), became nonsignificant after education of the family
head was taken into account. Additionally, the lack of effect
on FEV1
and FVC in boys indicates that home exposure to
tobacco smoke cannot be evoked to explain the racial differ-
ence in lung function in this group of asymptomatic healthy
girls and boys. The minimal effect of home smoke exposure
is different from other results obtained in general population
samples (17, 18). Our results should not be used to infer that
there is no effect of home tobacco smoke exposure in suscep-
tible children. Our failure to find an effect of home tobacco
smoke exposure on lung function was probably due to our
exclusion of children with asthma and other lung diseases,
who are more susceptible to environmental tobacco smoke.
In the younger subgroup of healthy girls and boys (mean
age = 10 years), we also found that in-utero smoke exposure,
though more common in White children than in African-
American children, was significantly higher only in boys.
This finding and the lack of an effect on lung function indi-
cate that maternal smoking during pregnancy does not
explain the racial difference in lung function in healthy boys
and girls.
Using the same younger subset, we found that the African-
American children had lower birth weights than Whites.
Even though birth weight was significantly associated with
lung function, the birth-weight differential between the two
racial groups explained 3­5 percent of the racial difference
between African Americans and Whites. The report by
Barker et al. (14) that lower birth weight was associated with
lower lung function in men and that mean FEV1
at age 59­70
years increased by 60 ml for each pound (0.45 kg) of birth
weight suggests that racial differences in birth weight might
affect the lung function racial difference in adults. The
unavailability of birth weight information for the older chil-
dren and the adults in NHANES III prevented us from esti-
mating the contribution of birth weight to the observed racial
difference in these groups.
The reasons for the lung volume difference between
Whites and African Americans are complex, because race is
a social as well as a biologic construct. In this study, the
largest component of the lung function difference was sitting
height. In addition to the socioeconomic variables listed in
tables 3­5, we examined the effects of family head employ-
ment status, availability of sufficient food, gender of the
family head, and household size. We also examined the
effects of such environmental factors as home and in-utero
tobacco smoke exposure and the effect of the racial differ-
ence in birth weight, all of which are associated with lower
lung function. These variables explained only a small
proportion of the racial difference in lung function.
The reason for the unexplained portion of the racial differ-
ence in lung function is not clear. It may be that we did not
adequately adjust for confounding anthropometric and
socioeconomic factors. Sitting height is not a perfect
measure of the size of the thorax and may not account for all
of the anthropometric racial difference. Furthermore, there
may be biologic components of this difference that are not
explained by sitting height. It is also likely that the socioeco-
nomic variables in NHANES III did not capture all of the
environmental factors that affect lung function and that other
factors that account for this difference were not measured in
NHANES III.

We also considered the possibility that the higher number
of African-American children with undiagnosed asthma or
other respiratory diseases might be responsible for the racial
difference in lung function. However, when we excluded
subjects whose FEV1
percent-predicted value was less than
80, we could account for only a slightly greater amount of
the adjusted racial difference than was observed for the
whole sample.
In conclusion, sitting height explains only 42­53 percent
of the racial difference in lung function between White chil-
dren and African-American children. Socioeconomic, nutri-
tional, and environmental variables measured in NHANES
III explained relatively little (7­10 percent) of the lower lung
volume in African Americans. Thus, the remaining differ-
ence in lung function must be attributable to unmeasured
variables or other biologic, environmental, or socioeconomic
factors.
