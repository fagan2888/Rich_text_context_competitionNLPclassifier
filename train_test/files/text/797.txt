This study investigates age and gender differences in the relative perception of social
support across adulthood. Findings indicate that age and gender do affect both the
perception of positive support and the perception of demandingness across different
support relationships. In all age groups, men appear to perceive spousal support as
the most positive, while women seem to perceive the support received from children as
being the most positive. However, it is apparent that all three relationships studied - those
with spouse, children, and friends/other relatives - are important sources of support
for both men and women.
Key Words: Social support, Gender, Age
Who Supports Whom? How Age and Gender
Affect the Perceived Quality of Support
from Family and Friends
Susan A. Lynch, PhD1
Over the past two decades there has been in-
creasing interest in the role social support plays in
helping people cope with life stress. Numerous stud-
ies have found that individuals who have a spouse,
friends, or family members who give them psycho-
logical and/or material support are healthier than those
without such relationships (Cohen & Wills, 1985;
Uchino, Cacioppo, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1996). Indeed,
the support supplied through social attachments with
family and friends has been shown not only to di-
rectly affect psychological adjustment (Sarason, Levin,
Basham, & Sarason, 1983; Streeter & Franklin, 1992),
but also to provide a buffer that helps moderate the
detrimental effects of life stress on health and well-
being (Seeman & Berkman, 1988; Smith, Fernengel,
Holcroft, Gerald, & Marien, 1994).
Nevertheless, research assessing the role of social
support in moderating the negative effects of life stress
indicates that the effectiveness of such support de-
pends on many factors. These include the type and
amount of support provided, as well as the context
surrounding the support transaction and the re-
cipient's satisfaction with the support (Antonucci, 1985;
Krause, 1987; Powell, 1990; Smith etal., 1994; Vaux,
1985; Ward, 1985). The conceptualizing and opera-
tionalizing of social support, often criticized as inad-
equate (Thoits, 1982), has undergone a series of
redefinitions and modifications in recent years. It has
become increasingly evident that characteristics of sup-
port quality are as important, if not more so, as those
relating to support quantity (Smith et al., 1994; Ward,
1985). Social support is now generally conceived to
be a complex construct with at least three distinct

dimensions: i) structure (e.g., type of relationship, size,
etc.); ii) function (e.g., the type of support actually
exchanged such as affective or instrumental support);
and iii) perceived quality (e.g., the recipient's subjec-
tive assessment of support exchanges and relation-
ships, distinct from simple existence) (Antonucci, 1994;
Cohen, 1992; Gottlieb, 1988; Powell, 1990; Streeter
& Franklin, 1992; Thoits, 1982).
It is clear that variability in these dimensions affects
not only the amount of support available, but also the
effectiveness of support given and received (Krause,
1987; Powell, 1990; Vaux, 1985; Ward, 1985). What
is not clear, however, is how other factors, such as
personal characteristics of both the support provider
and recipient, are related to variability in these social
support dimensions. Despite this lack of clarity, there
is growing evidence that two such characteristics - age
and gender - affect support relationships in important
ways (Antonucci, 1990, 1994; Antonucci & AKiyama,
1987a, 1987b; Barnett, Biener, & Baruch, 1987; Cohler
& Lieberman, 1980; Frieze, Parsons, Johnson, Ruble,
& Zellman, 1978; Ishii-Kuntz, 1990; Kessler & McLeod,
1984; Levitt, Weber, & Guacci, 1993; Schultz, 1991;
Silverman, 1987).
Specifying how gender and age differentially affect
variations in social support is especially important in
light of the fact that the correlation between mental
and physical health and social support variables has
often been weaker than predicted (Antonucci, 1985).
Indeed, research has consistently failed to find a
correlation between interaction with family and posi-
tive mental health outcomes in elderly samples (Ishii-
Kuntz, 1990). Even more alarming is the fact that, for
females, there appears to be a negative correlation
between support network size and satisfaction with
support (Cohler & Lieberman, 1980; Kessler & McLeod,
1984).
This article investigates how gender is related to two
dimensions of social support - type of relationship and

perceived quality - and how these relations change
across age groups. The analyses focus on the direct
and interaction effects of age level and gender on the
relative perceived quality of relationships with spouse,
children, and friends/other relatives across six life stages.
Literature Review
Vaux (1985) states that research has consistently
found significant gender differences in friend and
family relationships, and numerous other authors have
noted gender differences in the dimensions of sup-
port quality and structure (Antonucci, 1990,1994; An-
tonucci & Akiyama, 1987b; Barnett et al., 1987; Cohler
& Lieberman, 1980; Frieze et al., 1978; Kessler &
McLeod, 1984; Schultz, 1991; Silverman, 1987). For
example, adult women frequently report receiving
more support from friends and family members than
do men. Additionally, while women report having
close, intimate relationships with a few friends and
family members, men are more likely to report hav-
ing casual relationships with many people (see Schultz,
1991, and Vaux, 1985, for a comprehensive review).
Overall, findings indicate that the social and family
relationships of women, when compared to those of
men, tend to exhibit more closeness and intimacy,
and that women place a higher value on support reci-
procity. These findings have led some theorists to de-
scribe the support relationships of women as "qualita-
tively superior" to those of men (Antonucci, 1994).
However, there is growing evidence that, in some
cases, rather than buffering the negative effects of life
stress, women's larger, more intimate support net-
works actually increase their vulnerability to the detri-
mental effects of such stress (Antonucci, 1994; Kessler
& McLeod, 1984, Schultz, 1991). For example, women's
high level of involvement in the lives of significant
others, coupled with their role as the main providers
of support to spouses, children, aging parents, and
both women and men friends, may lead them to ex-
perience increased levels of distress when network
needs for support become too emotionally and/or
physically demanding (Starker, 1986).
In contrast, men may be more likely to experience
a lack of adequate support, especially after a divorce
or the death of a spouse. Indeed, one of the most
striking gender differences in the utilization of support
is the fact that men focus heavily on one provider of
support - their wives - whereas women most often
turn to women friends (Belle, 1987; Schultz, 1991).
Additionally, Depner and Ingersoll-Dayton (1985)
note that women in middle and old age are more
likely to have close relationships outside the marital
relationship than are men in these age groups. This
finding is supported by Antonucci (1994), who states
that gender differences in support network size are
the result of the fact that older women define signifi-
cantly more people as being "so close, it is hard to
imagine life without them."
Social exchange theorists point out that all relation-
ships incur certain costs to trie participants if they are
to be maintained, and hold that both or all partici-
pants in a social relationship not only receive ben-
efits, but also are subject to having demands made
upon their physical and emotional resources (Rook,
1992). Although social support relationships, by defi-
nition, were conceived as only positive and beneficial
in early literature, it has recently become evident that
these relationships can possess both positive and nega-
tive features (Rook, 1992). Therefore, in examining the
perception of quality of support from various relation-
ships across the life span, this research considers how
support interactions can be beneficial and/or stressful
for both participants.
Despite the numerous studies on gender differ-
ences, there have been few studies to date that have
examined social support from a life span perspective
(Ishii-Kuntz, 1990; Levitt et al., 1993). Most studies
that have explored age differences in support have
tended to focus on cross-generational transactions,
paying little attention to normative changes that
may occur in social support at different developmen-
tal stages. There is evidence, however, that such
changes do occur, and that variations in the structure
and perceived quality of social support is related to
these changes (Ishii-Kuntz, 1990; Levitt et al., 1993).
For example, Cowan and Cowan (1992) note that
young adults often become socially isolated when they
marry and start families. Indeed, the birth of the first
child often results in a significant decrease in social
interactions with nonparent friends and with co-
workers. Other studies have noted that middle-aged
adults may experience increased stress when they
are called upon to provide largely unreciprocated sup-
port to both their children and their aging parents
(Ingersoll-Dayton & Antonucci, 1988; Ishii-Kuntz, 1990;
Troll, 1987).
In addition to the variations in social support re-
lated directly to gender and age, it is important to
recognize that the interaction of these variables also
affects the structure, function, and perceived quality
of social support. For example, although it appears
women are more distressed by unreciprocal relation-
ships than are men (Antonucci, 1994), it appears that
a desire for reciprocity in support relationships adds
to women's levels of stress for different reasons at dif-
ferent points in the life span. Young adulthood is a
time when women often begin careers, marry, and
start having children. Although work relationships,
other friendships, and partner relationships may pro-
vide adequate support for women before they be-
come parents, these supportive relationships can be
disrupted by the birth of the first child (Cowan &
Cowan, 1992). This can result in a significant increase
in stress, especially if the woman perceives her hus-
band as nonsupportive. Thus, a young, new mother
may find her emotional and physical energy taxed
by the demands of a new infant, who cannot recip-
rocate, at the same time she is receiving less sup-
port from others in her network due to a decrease in
contact.
In middle adulthood, however, unreciprocal rela-
tionships may be stressful for a different reason. Dur-
ing this period, many close relationships are not re-
ciprocal in nature. Middle-aged women tend to be
232 The Gerontologist
the primary caretaker for their spouse, children, and
aging parents (Ingersoll-Dayton & Antonucci, 1988;
Ishii-Kuntz, 1990; Troll, 1987). Therefore, it is likely
that these women will find themselves in a position
of receiving less support than they provide to a large
number of network members. Additionally, it may be
that the larger and closer the network, the more likely
it is that these women will be faced with providing
support to network members for whom they feel re-
sponsible and from whom they cannot expect imme-
diate reciprocation.
For these reasons, it is likely that above and be-
yond the direct effects gender and age have on
variation in social support, there is also a significant
effect for the interaction of these variables. Although
several studies have explored this interaction, few, if
any, have done so from a life span perspective. This
is important because it is likely that men and women
will perceive the quality and the demandingness of
their support relationships differently at different age
levels.
These analyses not only examine the direct and in-
teraction effects of both age and gender on the per-
ceived quality of social support, but build on previ-
ous research in two ways. First, these data present a
unique opportunity to assess the perceptions of the
positive support received from and trie demands
made by one's spouse, children, and friends/other rela-
tives in relation to each other. This allows for a com-
parison of how positive and/or stressful these relation-
ships are perceived to be. Additionally, by looking at
these perceptions across five age groups, we can be-
gin to identify normative changes that may occur in
men's and women's perceptions of their support net-
works over the life span.
Study Question and Hypotheses
The question addressed here is whether age group,
gender, and/or their interaction affect the relative per-
ceived quality of support received from three types of
relationships across the life span. The three types of
relationships examined are those with one's spouse,
one's children, and one's friends/other relatives.
Hypothesis I
Given previous research findings that indicate there
are gender differences in all three dimensions of
social support - structure, function, and perceived
quality (Antonucci, 1990, 1994; Antonucci & Aklyama,
1987b; Barnett et al., 1987; Cohler & Lieberman,
1980; Frieze et al., 1978; Kessler & McLeod, 1984;
Schultz, 1991; Silverman, 1987), it is hypothesized that
the perception of positive support from these rela-
tionships will vary on the basis of gender. Specifically,
it is proposed that women will report receiving more
positive support from their children and from friends/
other relatives than will men, while men will report
receiving more positive support from their spouses than
will women.
Furthermore, in assessing the perceived level of de-
mands made by these relationships, it is hypothesized
that women will perceive all three types of relation-
ships as more demanding than will men. This is
based on findings that indicate women are called up-
on more often than men by network members for
support (Schultz, 1991).
Hypothesis II
Although there is less known about the direct
effect of age on the perceived quality of social sup-
port relationships, studies that have been done (Ishii-
Kuntz, 1990; Levitt et al., 1993) lend support to a
hypothesis that age level, too, will evince a direct ef-
fect on both the perception of positive support and
the perception of level of demandingness across these
relationships. Specifically, it is expected that there will
be a general increase in the perception of positive
support across age groups, coupled with a general de-
crease in the perception of demandingness across these
relationships.
Additionally, given the largely unreciprocated na-
ture of a parent's relationship with his or her young
and adolescent children, it is hypothesized that one's
relationship with one's children will be rated as pro-
viding the least positive support, and as being the most
demanding, for younger respondents. However, it is
expected that both perceptions will change as age level
increases. Many elderly adults report receiving high
levels of support from their adult children, while few
report these relationships as being overly demanding
(Isnii-Kuntz, 1990). Thus, it is likely that perception of
positive support will increase with age level, while the
perception of demandingness will decrease.
Hypothesis III
It is expected that there will be an interaction ef-
fect of age level and gender. Given prior research find-
ings indicating that women are particularly vulnerable
to feeling a decrease in positive support while experi-
encing an increase in support demands at certain life
stages (e.g., after the birth of their first child, during
middle adulthood) (Cowan & Cowan, 1992; Ingersoll-
Dayton & Antonucci, 1988; Ishii-Kuntz, 1990; Troll,
1987), it is expected that there will be more variation
in perception of positive support and level of demand-
ingness for women than for men across age groups.
Methods
Sample
This research analyzes the main and interaction ef-
fects of age level and gender on the relative perceived
quality ot support received from one's spouse, chil-
dren, and friends/other relatives across six adult de-
velopmental stages. This is a secondary analysis of data
gathered as part of the larger Americans' Changing
Lives (ACL) data set collected by James S. House (1986
& 1989). These data constitute the second wave in a
national longitudinal panel survey of people aged 27
years or older in the United States. Sampling con-
sisted of a multistage stratified area probability sample,
Vol. 38, No. 2, 1998 233
with over sampling of those 60 years-of-age and older.
Data were collected during face-to-face interviews con-
ducted by interviewers trained at the Survey Research
Center in the Institute for Social Research at the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
A subsample of respondents from the larger study
sample used in this research consisted of 2,867 Cau-
casian women and men aged 27 years and older. The
decision to control for racial differences by including
only Caucasian adults in the sample was based on re-
search that indicates there are significant differences
in the social support networks of African Americans
and Caucasians (Lynch, in press; Petchers & Milligan,
1987; Weinberger, Hiner, & Tierney, 1987). Since the
focus of this research is on age and gender differ-
ences across the life span, and treating these popula-
tions as homogenous is theoretically and methodo-
logically flawed, the decision was made to examine
only a Caucasian sample to control for the effect of
race.
The sample was further reduced as a function of
the comparative nature of this research which focuses
on the perception of quality of support across three
types of relationships - with spouse, children, and friends/
other relatives. The final sample consists of only those
respondents who reported having all three types of
relationships at the time of data collection, resulting
in a final sample n of 1154. Table 1 presents a sum-
mary of the sample divided by age and gender.
Operational Definitions of Variables
The predictor variables used in this analysis were
age, gender, and the interaction of these variables. In
order to ascertain the effect of age, the continuous
age variable in the original data set was divided into
six age groups based on the stages of adulthood
identified by Ishii-Kuntz (1990). The resulting six
categories were: i) young-adult: 27-30-years-old; ii)
early middle-age: 31-40-years-old; iii) middle-age: 4 1 -
50-years-old; iv) late middle-age: 51-64-years-old;

v) young-old: 65-74-years-old; and vi) old-old: 75-
98-years-old. Because there were no respondents in
the young-adult category who had all three types
of relationships, this category was eliminated. For
analysis, the categorical variable gender was dummy
coded into a dichotomous variable with males coded
as 1 and females coded as 2.
Positive support was operationalized by replicating
the positive support indices created by House and
Kahn (1985) using equivalent items from ACL: Wave
1. Respondents were asked to rate their spouse, their
children, and their friends or other relatives separately
in response to the items "(this person) makes me feel
loved and cared for" and "(this person) is willing to
listen to me." A positive support index was then
formed for each relationship by averaging the Likert
scale responses to these items (7 = a great deal; 2 =
quite a bit; 3 = some; 4 = a little; 5 = not at all).
The internal consistency for each index was measured
using Cronbach's alpha in order to assess reliability.
All alpha coefficients were .70 or greater.
Demandingness was operationalized by using a
single indicator. Again respondents were asked to rate
their spouse, children, and friends or other relatives
separately on a Likert scale in response to the item
"(this person) makes too many demands on me." The
anchors for this variable were: 1 = a great deal; 2 =
quite a bit; 3 = some; 4 = a little; 5 = not at all.
The positive support indices and the demand-
ingness indicator were used to measure respondents'
perception of the quality of support received across
three types of relationships - spousal, children, and
friends/other relatives. Obviously, the last category of
relationship - friends or other relatives - is problem-
atic. It is highly probable that relationships with friends
are quite different from relationships with other rela-
tives, especially considering that siblings would be in-
cluded in the "other relative" category. Indeed, in most
studies, relationships with friends and with siblings
are considered separately and are often shown to re-
late to support variables in distinct ways (Wilson, Calsyn,
& Orlofsky, 1994).
Unfortunately, in this data set, these relationships
cannot be separated for analysis. But despite the
problems with this variable, it is clear from the analy-
ses that there are both age and gender differences in
the perception of positive support from the relation-
ships it represents. Therefore, it is included in the
present study with the acknowledgment that find-
ings related to this variable must be interpreted with
caution.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using a repeated measures de-
sign multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). This
design allowed the rating of perception of positive sup-
port and level of demandingness for each type of
relationship to be considered in relation to each other
by testing for within-subject variation. Additionally, the
effects of age, gender, and their interaction were
measured by identifying these variables as between-
subject factors.
234 The Gerontologist
Results
Hypothesis I
The results of the MANOVA, shown in Table 2,
offer partial support for Hypothesis I. As expected, the
main effect of gender on the perception of posi-
tive support is statistically significant. Although both
women and men tend to rate all three relationships
highly in terms of positive support, women appear to
have a more positive perception of the support they
receive from their children and from their friends than
do men. In contrast, men tend to perceive the sup-
port they receive from their spouses more positively
than do women. Further, while men perceive their
wives as providing the most positive support, women
tend to perceive the support received from their chil-
dren as being the most positive. Gender also appears
to have a direct effect on the perception of positive
support across the three types of relationships. Men
generally rate the positive support they receive from
their wives more highly than women rate the positive
support they receive from their husbands. Women rate
the support received from their children and friends/
other relatives more highly than men rate the support
received from these relationships.
However, contrary to expectations, the effect of

gender on demandingness is not statistically significant
(see Table 3). Men and women tend to rate the
demandingness of these relationships similarly and
these similarities appear to be stable across age groups.
Men and women in all age groups except the oldest
(75- to 98-years-old) rate their friends/other rela-
tives as less demanding than their spouses and chil-
dren. After age 51, both men and women rate their
spouses as being the most demanding. Indeed, al-
though women between the ages of 31 and 50 rate
their children as being most demanding, men between
the ages of 31 and 40 rate their spouses and children
as being similarly demanding. While men seem to per-
ceive the support received from their spouses the most
positively, they also appear to see these relationships
as being the most demanding. For both men and
women, children and friends/other relatives appear to
offer a high level of positive support without being
perceived as being overly demanding.
Hypothesis II
These findings also offer only partial support for
Hypothesis II. The combined observed means for

within-subject effect of age-level on the positive sup-
port indices for spouse, children, and friends/other rela-
tives are presented in Table 2. These data indicate
that all three types of relationships offer a fairly high
level of positive support across age groups. However,
contrary to expectations, the perception of positive sup-
port from these relationships did not increase with age
level. Indeed, only one of the relationships, that with
children, evinced an increase in perceived positive sup-
port across age groups. The perception of support
from the other two relationships remained fairly stable
for each age group, although the perception of sup-
port from friends/other relatives does seem to have a
somewhat curvilinear relation with age level.
As predicted, for all three relationships, the per-
ception of demandingness decreases as age level in-
creases. Although the mean scores indicate that none
of the relationships are perceived as being highly
demanding, relationships with friends/other relatives
appear to be the least demanding for both men and
women.
Hypothesis III
These data do not support the expected interac-
tion effect for age level and gender on either per-
ceived positive support or perceived demandingness.
The interaction term for age level and gender was
not statistically significant in the analyses. When the
means for perception of positive support for the five
age groups are broken down by gender, as presented
in Table 2, it is clear that the gender differences dis-
cussed before are consistent across age groups. Simi-
larly, age-level differences noted in the perception of
demandingness from all three types of relationships
do not appear to interact with gender (Table 3).
Discussion
These analyses indicate that gender does affect
the perception of positive support from one's spouse,
children, and friends/other relatives. However, it does
not appear to significantly affect the perception of
demandingness from these same relationships. Addi-
tionally, although it was expected that all three rela-
tionships would be perceived more positively as age-
level increased, this was true only for the perception
of support from one's children. The perception of
support from one's spouse and friends/other relatives
appears to remain relatively stable across age groups.
However, as expected, all three relationships were
perceived as less demanding as age level increased.
Finally, contrary to expectations, there was no signifi-
cant interaction effect for gender and age level on ei-
ther the perception of positive support or the percep-
tion of demandingness for any of these relationships.
The direct effect of gender on the perception of
positive support is consistent with prior research find-
ings (Antonucci, 1990, 1994; Antonucci & Akiyama,
1987b; Barnett et al., 1987; Cohler & Lieberman,
1980; Frieze et al., 1978; Kessler & McLeod, 1984;
Schultz, 1991; Silverman, 1987).
However, unlike previous studies, these data pres-
ent strong evidence that children provide women with
a more consistently positive source of support than
do their husbands. What is surprising is that the rat-
ings women give for the support received from their
spouses and that received from their friends/other rel-
atives vary, at most, by .3 of a point. This would in-
dicate that, contrary to previous findings, women do
not see their friends and relatives as being significantly
more supportive than their spouses.
Also interesting is the fact that men rate the sup-
port they receive from their children as being as
positive as that received from their friends/other rela-
tives, even at life stages when children are presum-
ably young. This provides evidence that men may
receive satisfaction and support from their children
across the life span.
These findings have implications for the mental
health of both men and women throughout the life
span. For example, when working with male clients
for whom marital or partnership disruption is an
issue, mental health practitioners should be aware
that male clients may become socially isolated, and
may not have many support resources available to
them. Indeed, male clients who lose their spouses
through death or divorce may be losing their most
positive source of support, and may be particularly
vulnerable to depression and feelings of hopelessness.
Conversely, when working with women, it is im-
portant to be aware that women may receive a sig-
nificant amount of support from their friends and adult
children. Indeed, for women age 65 and older, it ap-
pears that their most supportive relationships are with
their children, even when they have a spouse. This
finding is important when one considers the mobility
of modern society, and the fact that this study mea-
sured support quality (e.g., the extent to which one
"felt loved and cared for" and "listened to"), and not
support function (e.g., type of support actually ex-
changed), which can be an indication of actual
proximity. It is possible that a significant number of
married older women feel a strong emotional con-
nection to their children, but are in fact geographi-
cally isolated from them.
These findings also are important when working
with women who are moving due to career or other
life changes. Whereas men are probably taking their
most important source of support with them, women
are likely to be leaving significant relationships behind.
Additionally, in this context, it is important to note
that, as the population ages, women may be outliving
their adult children, especially sons. In these in-
stances, counseling may be needed to deal not only
with grief, but also with the loss of an important source
of perceived support.
Perhaps the most surprising findings, however, are
those regarding relative perception of demanding-
ness. Although it was expected that women would
rate their spouses as being relatively more demanding
than their children and friends/other relatives, it was
not expected that men would also perceive their
wives as being most demanding. This is due to the
fact that men consistently report their spousal rela-
236 The Gerontologist
tionships as being very supportive (Antonucci, 1990;
Antonucci & Aklyama, 1987b; Vaux, 1985). Obviously,
both men and women experience their spousal rela-
tionships as having costs as well as benefits. However,
men may feel there is more balance between the
two than do women, especially in later stages of life.
Since friends/other relatives are seen as offering a
high level of positive support, the fact that they are
also viewed as relatively undemanding indicates these
types of relationships may be, overall, less stressful than
those with one's spouse and children, especially for
persons who are early-middle- and middle-aged. Given
that this is a time when people may feel the strain of
providing a large amount of support to children and
aging parents, friends may offer a relatively stress-free
source of social interaction. Unfortunately, at this life
stage, previous studies indicate that people may feel
they have little or no time to spare on maintaining
friendships given the demands of their jobs and fami-
lies (Ingersoll-Dayton & Antonucci, 1988; Ishii-Kuntz,
1990; Troll, 1987).
Interestingly, except for the respondents in the
early-middle- and middle-age groups when children
are likely to be in middle childhood or adolescence,
spouses are viewed as being the most demanding of
the three relationships. Although none of the relation-
ships appear to be overly demanding, this highlights
what may be the ongoing give and take in the mari-
tal relationship as opposed to other relationships that
continue to be positive sources of support and are
perceived as less demanding with increasing age.
Additionally, when working with couples, it is im-
portant to understand how the perception of positive
support and demandingness can affect each part-
ner's view of the relationship. Although both partners
may perceive the demands made by their spouse simi-
larly, the woman may be more dissatisfied if she does
not share her spouse's view of the positive support
available from the relationship. Additionally, the man
may be hurt and confused by his wife's different per-
ception of the balance between positive support re-
ceived and demands made.
This may be particularly important when consider-
ing that many people over age 65 who are married
may be facing more and more physical limitations at
the same time that their spouse is experiencing simi-
lar problems. There is a need to thoroughly assess the
support and respite needs of elderly couples, espe-
cially those who are childless or who have infrequent
contact with their children. This is especially true for
men, who may not receive needed support from
friends and other informal sources.
Men do perceive the support they receive from
their children and their friends/other relatives posi-
tively, and they do not seem to see these relation-
ships as overly demanding. In contrast to previous
studies that indicate men do not receive a high level
of support from their children (Schultz, 1991; Vaux,
1985), the male respondents in this sample seem to
perceive their children's support very positively. It may
be that as men are participating more in the rear-
ing of their children, they are cultivating relationships
with them that are closer and more intimate. These
relationships, in turn, may become effective sources
of support for men who have lost their spouses.
Conclusions
This study investigates age and gender differences
in the relative perception of social support across
adulthood. The results of this study not only replicate
many previous findings, but also add to the existing
knowledge base on social support. These data offer
new evidence that children provide both mothers
and fathers with strong feelings of love and support
throughout the life span. Additionally, although on
average, male respondents rated their spouses most
positively in terms of support, the mean ratings for
the support they receive from their children also were
quite positive.
Also important is the evidence that, despite the fact
that men tend to view spousal support more pos-
itively than do women, there is no significant gender
difference in the rating of spousal demandingness. This
finding may help further our understanding of the
complexity of marital relationships, especially in re-
gard to marital satisfaction.
Finally, the analysis of these data indicates that there
is no interaction effect for age and gender on either
the positive perception of social support or the per-
ception of demandingness. This suggests that the
changes in the perception of social support that
appear to occur for both men and women at differ-
ent life stages remain consistent in terms of evinced
gender differences. Most unexpected was the finding
that the perception of demandingness from spouses,
children, and friends and other relatives are not sig-
nificantly different for women and men even at
different age levels.
Although this research adds to the understand-
ing of how gender and age affect the perception
of social support, the interpretation of the analyses is
restricted by the fact that the data are cross-sectional
as opposed to longitudinal. For this reason, many of
the age differences may simply be a result of a cohort
effect. Because several of the age-related differences
have implications for mental health practice, it is im-
portant that future research examine these relations
in a longitudinal design. Fortunately, the data set used
in this research is the second wave of such a longi-
tudinal study. Therefore, the research regarding age
differences in social support begun here can be
expanded in the future.
In conclusion, there are two ways in which future
research needs to expand upon the present study.
First, in order to control for racial differences, the
sample used in this study was composed exclusively
of Caucasians. Although this allowed these analyses
to focus on age and gender, it is highly probable that
there are significant racial differences in how age
and gender affect the dimensions of social support.
Therefore, it is important that future replications in-
clude a racially diverse sample.
Additionally, these analyses are limited to the
examination of gender and age effects on only one

dimension of social support - perceived quality. An
important next step is to examine whether and/or
how differences in these personal characteristics af-
fect the structure and function of support networks as
well as mental and physical well-being of adults across
the life span.
