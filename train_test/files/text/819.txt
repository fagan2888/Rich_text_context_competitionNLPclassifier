The Factor Structure of the CES-D in Two Surveys
of Elderly Mexican Americans
Todd Q. Miller, Kyriakos S. Markides, and Sandra A. Black
University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas.
Thefactor structure of the Centerfor Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) has not been well defined
among elderly Mexican Americans. Although most prior research suggests the CES-D has four factors, prior
research also suggests that the factor structure of the CES-D may vary with culture. In addition, previous theory
and research on other depression inventories suggest only two factors: a general depression factor and a psycho-
logical well-being factor. The current study determines the number of factors for the CES-D in the Hispanic Estab-
lished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies (H-EPESE) survey fN = 2,536) and in a previous study of elderly
Mexican Americans living in San Antonio, Texas (
T
V = 330). The factor analytic results argue strongly for the
two-factor model, and this model is the only structure that yielded consistent results across subgroups (e.g., male vs
female or Spanish vs English language of interview). We conclude that the CES-D has only two factors among
elderly Mexican Americans.
THE Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression
Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) has been widely used as
an indicator of depressive affect (Roberts and Vernon, 1983;
Weissman et al., 1977) including research on elderly persons
(e.g., Berkman et al., 1986; Blazer et al., 1991; Davidson,
Feldman, and Crawford, 1994; Gatz et al., 1993; Lewinsohn
et al., 1986). Factor analyses of the CES-D usually have
found four dimensions of somatic symptoms, depressive
affect, positive affect, and interpersonal behavior (Gatz et al.,
1993; Hertzog et al., 1990; Radloff, 1977; Sheehan et al.,
1995). However, some cultures may express depression
more somatically than in terms of affect leading to a blurring
of the somatic and affect factors (Angel and Thoits, 1987;
Dick et al., 1994; Weissman et al., 1977). In addition,
research suggests that culture may influence the CES-D
structure in other ways. For example, Liang et al. (1989) in a
Mexican American sample found support for a three-factor
model of somatic symptoms, depressed affect, and positive
affect. In this sample, the interpersonal factor was not pres-
ent, and the somaticism and affect factors did not blur
together. The current study attempts to determine the factor
structure of the CES-D for elderly Mexican Americans.
There are several reasons why the standard four-factor
solution for the CES-D may not apply for elderly Mexican
Americans. First, this solution is somewhat inconsistent
with the structure of other widely used depression invento-
ries with similar items that have found only two factors:
one general depression factor and a second positive affect
factor (Aneshensel, Clark, and Fredrichs, 1983; Catanzaro,
1994; Tanaka and Huba, 1984; Volk, Pace, and Parchman,
1993). These two dimensional structures are consistent
with theory (Watson and Clark, 1984) and research (Costa
and McCrae, 1980; Veit and Ware, 1983) that suggests neg-
ative affect and well-being are the two major dimensions of
emotion. In support of the two-dimensional theory, research
suggests that the CES-D may have two higher order factors
(McCallum et al., 1995; Sheehan et al., 1995). Another
argument against the four-factor structure is the finding that
four-factor solutions have varied so that the same items
have not always been assigned to the same factors produc-
ing a somewhat inconsistent pattern of results (for a review,
see Liang et al., 1989).
The problem of inconsistent four-factor solutions can be
produced by using a factor solution that specified too many
factors (Kim and Mueller, 1978). The use of scales based
on these mispecified solutions can produce unreliable
scales that share common variance with other scales (Hert-
zog, 1989; Kim and Mueller, 1978) and produce inconsis-
tent patterns of results (Kim and Mueller, 1978) that can
lead to a lack of consensus regarding which items appear
on each subscale (Liang et al., 1989). Furthermore, this
type of faulty subscale construction can contribute to con-
fusion regarding how to conceptualize the symptomatology
of depression (Watson and Clark, 1984).
In addition to these methodological issues, factor structure
may vary with culture (Angel and Thoits, 1987; Dick et al.,
1994; Liang et al., 1989; Weissman et al., 1977) and age
(Gatz and Hurwicz, 1990). For all of these reasons, there is a
need to determine the optimal number of subscales that can
be used for elderly Mexican American populations.
Previous Research
Krause and Markides (1985) found four factors for the
CES-D in a Mexican American sample, although a reanaly-
sis of the same data identified a more parsimonious three-
factor structure that was valid for subjects aged 65 to 80
(Liang et al., 1989). In another Mexican American sample of
1,244 adults, Golding and Aneshensel (1989) reported a fac-
tor analysis where the number of factors was determined by
scree plots and conceptual content. The factor solution they
found is identical to Radloff's (1977) original four factors,
although three items did not load highly on any factor.

The Hispanic HANES study of 3,117 Mexican American
adults reported a three-factor solution (Guarnaccia, Angel,
and Worobey, 1989). However, these researchers used prin-
cipal components analysis with an orthogonal (varimax)
rotation. Prior studies have found high correlations between
CES-D factors, so results will vary when the more appro-
priate oblique rotation method is used (Hertzog, 1989).
Another analysis of the same data examined the 329 sub-
jects who were 60 years old or older using oblique (pro-
max) rotation. This analysis found a four-factor solution
(Garcia and Marks, 1989), although the results suggest that
too many factors may have been selected. Seven items did
not load on any factor using the usual correlation greater
than .40 criterion, and many items loaded on more than one
factor. These results suggest that too many factors were
extracted prior to rotation (Kim and Mueller, 1978).
Methodological Issues
In recent years, several methodological improvements
have been developed for confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA). These new methods may produce different results
than prior research based on exploratory factor analyses
(EFA) or earlier versions of CFA. First, newly developed
multiple indicators, multiple causes (MIMIC) CFA models
allow for the testing of factor structure and the effects of
background variables simultaneously (Muthen, 1989). For
example, researchers can test whether the model is general-
izable across important background variables for research
on Mexican Americans such as age, gender, and language
of interview.
In addition, MIMIC models allow for the testing of item
bias. MIMIC model testing for item bias is superior to pre-
viously used methods because MIMIC models give sepa-
rate estimates of the degree to which an item is biased and
the degree to which the latent depression variable is gen-
uinely correlated with the potential biasing factor (e.g.,
gender). For MIMIC models, item bias on the CES-D is
defined as an item that is more highly correlated with a
potential biasing factor beyond what would be expected
based on the relationship between the latent variable of
depression and the potential biasing factor. For example,
gender could be more highly correlated with the CES-D
item regarding "crying spells" than the latent depression
variable representing the CES-D. If this item bias is pres-
ent, then females would receive higher scores on the
CES-D because they report crying more than men even
when they are not depressed. The MIMIC model approach
is equivalent to the Item Response Theory (IRT) approach
to testing for item bias.
Prior research suggests that depression rates among Mexi-
can Americans are higher than the general population (Mor-
ton et al., 1989), particularly for elders and women. It is
important for research to determine how much of these
increased rates are due to biasing factors and how much
reflect genuine differences in levels of depression for sub-
groups of Mexican Americans. For example, age may cause
bias on depression inventories so that age-related differ-
ences in depression are exaggerated (Gallo, Anthony, and
Muthen, 1995; Gatz and Hurwicz, 1990). Similar problems
have been reported for gender (Stommel et al., 1993).
Another recent issue has been the development of
improved factor analytic methods for handling ordinal and
non-normally distributed variables (Joreskog and Sorbom,
1993). CES-D items tend to be highly skewed toward
non-depressed responses so the use of these new methods
may produce new findings. In addition, new guidelines
have been established for reporting and testing CFA find-
ings (Joreskog, 1993). These new methods have not been
applied to research on the structure of the CES-D. There-
fore, these techniques have the potential to reinterpret prior
research and lead to a greater understanding of the nature
and causes of inconsistent findings in research on the struc-
ture of the CES-D.
The Current Study
We investigate the dimensionality of the CES-D in the
Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies
(H-EPESE) survey of elderly Mexican Americans living in
the Southwestern United States and in the oldest group of
subjects from a three-generations study of Mexican Ameri-
cans (Markides et al., 1983). The H-EPESE was modeled
after the EPESE studies conducted in New Haven, East
Boston, North Carolina, and rural Iowa (Cornoni-Huntley et
al., 1986).
METHODS
Sampling Design
The H-EPESE sample was designed to represent the non-
institutionalized southwestern Mexican American elderly
(65 years old or over) population. Noninstitutionalized per-
sons were defined as living in a dwelling with fewer than
five adults. A complete list of counties in Texas, California,
Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico were ranked by per-
centage of elderly Mexican Americans according to 1990
Census Bureau estimates. Counties and census tracts within
counties were subsequently selected to yield a representa-
tive sample of over 90 percent of Mexican American
elderly persons in the Southwestern states. All small coun-
ties where the elderly Mexican Americans represented
30 percent of the total population were included. Subjects
were selected using area probability sampling procedures
that involved selection of counties, census tracts, and
households within selected census tracts. Interviewers
screened a total of 175 households within each sampling
unit. One hundred households were screened during the
first phase with the number of eligible respondents from
those initial 30,000 screened households determining the
size of phase two.
Phase one interviewers began making contacts at the first
100 housing units they had listed and only went beyond this
point as needed. The phase two interviewers began screen-
ing at the point where the first phase had been completed
for an additional 75 contacts. Up to four attempts were
made to screen each household with visits on different days
of the week and at different times. Eligible subjects were
interviewed in their homes in their preferred language of
either English or Spanish.
The response rate for the survey was 86 percent. Among
the 3,050 subjects who were deemed eligible for the study,

2,873 were interviewed in person and 177 (5.8%) by proxy,
who did not receive the CES-D. We report on the 2,536
subjects who completed all items on the CES-D scale. Ap-
proximately 42.5 percent were male, with 44.0 percent
being born in Mexico. The average age was 73. Table 1
presents the zero-order item correlation matrix of the
CES-D. For all analyses including Table 1, the sample was
weighted to take account of the unequal probabilities of
selection.
In order to replicate our findings, we also used data from
the Three Generation Study of Mexican Americans (Krause
and Markides, 1985). The dimensionality of the CES-D in
this sample was previously examined by Liang et al. (1989)
and Krause and Markides (1985). Data for this study were
collected during 1981 and 1982 using area probability sam-
pling procedures. There were 375 subjects in each genera-
tion. The older generation used for our analysis ranged in
age from 65 to 80, and 70 percent of the sample were
women (see Markides et al., 1983). Among the 375 elderly
subjects, 330 had complete CES-D data.
Measures
Depressive symptomatology. -- Depression was assessed
by the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depres-
sion scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Although not an indica-
tor of clinical depression, the total score has been used as
an indicator of degree of negative affect (Boyd et al., 1982).
Background variables. -- Depressive symptomatology is
known to be related to gender and age, so these variables
were included in the analysis. For the H-EPESE study, lan-
guage of interview was used as another control variable
that may relate to the presentation of depression. Number
of years of schooling was also included. The same variables
were used for the Three Generation Study with the excep-
tion that language of interview was not a variable. For this
study, bilingual interviewers were used, and each question-
naire was written in both languages. As a proxy for lan-
guage of interview, a four-item language preference scale
was used. This scale is similar to scales used in previous
research on Mexican Americans (Cuellar, Harris, and Jasso,
1980). Higher scores indicate a greater preference for using
Spanish.
Exploratory FactorAnalyses (EFAs)
We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to suggest
viable factor structures for the CES-D. Previous research
has identified several different factor structures, and the
results of at least one study of older Mexican Americans
suggests that a four-factor solution may have included too
many factors. One potential reason for reporting a solution
with too many factors is the reliance on the eigenvalue
greater than 1.0 rule that is the default option for many
computer packages (Kim and Mueller, 1978). Therefore,
we compare results using other indicators of structure with
the results when just the eigenvalue greater than 1.0 rule is
used. For these analyses, we used subgroups based on gen-
der and language of interview. We did not subgroup by age
or level of education because this would lead to sample size
S262 MILLER ETAL.
problems for the subgroups and our initial analyses deter-
mined that age and education were not associated with fac-
tor structure or highly correlated with items on the CES-D.
Due to these low correlations, education was dropped as a
background variable.
For the EFAs, we used maximum likelihood estimation
with oblique (promax) rotation where the prior communality
(i.e., the variance of the observed variable that is accounted
for by the latent variable) was set to be proportional to the
squared multiple correlations (SMCs) between the observed
variables and the latent variable with adjustment so that
their sum is equal to the maximum absolute correlations.
This is the most conservative and accepted method for ob-
taining communality estimates (Lawley and Maxwell,
1971). Items with correlations greater than .40 were con-
sidered to load on a factor. We also examined correlations
between items on all factors, which is a method that can be
used to determine the appropriate number of factors (Kim
and Mueller, 1978; Lawley and Maxwell, 1971).
Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs)
Adjusting for group differences. -- Two methods have
been used within the CFA framework for modeling hetero-
geneity produced from different groups of individuals (e.g.,
age, gender, and language of interview): (a) multiple groups
analyses and (b) multiple indicators, multiple causes
(MIMIC) models (Muthen, 1989). Because multiple groups
analysis requires large numbers of people in all possible
cross-classifications of the grouping variables, we decided to
use MIMIC models for testing the validity of our data across
various subgroups such as age, gender, and language of inter-
view. According to Muthen (1989), the advantages of the
MIMIC model approach are that it provides testing of (a) the
strength of prediction of the background variables, (b)
dimensionality, which was the purpose of the current study,
(c) simultaneous effects of several background variables
(e.g., gender, language of interview), and across-group het-
erogeneity in measurement intercepts by allowing direct
effects from observed exogenous variables to observed
endogenous variables. The extent to which such direct effects
are required can be tested by examining modification indices
associated with a baseline no-direct-effects model (Gallo,
Anthony, and Muthen, 1995; Muthen, 1989). Modification
indices are chi-squared tests with one degree of freedom that
estimate the improvement in fit in the overall model that
would occur if a single parameter (e.g., a direct effect) was
freed. A limitation of MIMIC models is the assumption of
a group-invariant covariance matrix, conditional upon the
exogenous variables. This assumption is reasonable if the
background variables do not interact to change the structure
across subgroups (e.g., younger males who were interviewed
in Spanish have a different factor structure than older women
interviewed in English). We used LISREL VIII software
(Joreskog and Sorbom, 1988) to produce weighted least
squares (WLS) estimates for all CFA models.
Treatment of ordinal, nominal, and ratio scaled variables.
-- For our CFAs of the ordinally scaled five-point CES-D
items, we initially hoped to use the generally recommended
procedure of polychoric correlations (Babakus, Ferguson,
and Joreskog, 1987). Polychoric correlations are estimates
of what the Pearson correlation would be for two ordinal
variables assuming an underlying bivariate normal distribu-
tion. The assumption of bivariate normality can be tested
for a pair of items using Stieger's (1990) root mean square
error of approximation (RMSEA). Browne and Cudeck
(1993) suggest that the assumption of bivariate normality is
tenable when the RMSEA is not greater than .08, although
a close fit is only offered for RMSEAs that are less than
.05. For the 190 correlations between items on the CES-D
in our sample, less than 25 percent of the RMSEAs were
less than .05 and 52 (27%) were greater than .08. There-
fore, polychoric correlations were not used and instead, as
recommended by Joreskog and Sorbom (1993), observa-
tions on ordinal variables were replaced by normal scores
determined from the marginal distributions. The categorical
variables of gender and language of interview were treated
as fixed effects. Age was considered to be a ratio level vari-
able measured without error, so this variable was also
treated as a fixed effect as recommended by Joreskog and
Sorbom (1993). For the H-EPESE data, asymptotic covari-
ance matrices were used to adjust for multivariate non-nor-
mality. An asymptotic covariance matrix could not be used
for the Three Generation Study data because many negative
error variances emerged. According to Bentler and Chou
(1988), this negative variance problem is usually due to
insufficient sample size. They argue that the ratio of param-
eters to sample size should be at least 10 to 1 when using
an asymptotic covariance matrix. The two-factor model for
the Three Generation Study requires the estimation of 52
parameters so the minimum sample size should be 520. The
sample size of 330 in this study is 190 subjects less than
520. Therefore, an asymptotic covariance matrix could not
be used for the Three Generation Study.
Model comparisons and evaluation. -- We test several
alternate CFA models including a four-factor model
reported by Krause and Markides (1985), a four-factor
model reported in several studies (Golding and Aneshensel,
1989; Hertzog et al., 1990; Radloff, 1977), and a model
based upon the results of our EFAs. The CFA models we
tested were rejected by a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test
at the p < .0001 level of significance. This finding is not
surprising because the chi-squared test is dependent on
sample size and therefore, in large samples, models may
be rejected when they only depart trivially from the data
(Joreskog and Sorbom, 1988). To assess the relative good-
ness-of-fit of our models, we employed several widely used
goodness-of-fit indexes including the Goodness-of-Fit
Index (GFI), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Adjusted
Goodness-of-Fit Index (AGFI), and the Tucker Lewis Coef-
ficient (TLC). The GFI and CFI indices assess the relative
amount of the variances and covariances that are predicted
by the model. The CFI also adjusts for bias due to asymp-
totic sample size. All of these indices usually have values
between 1 and 0. Values greater than .90 indicate that the
model fits the data reasonably well.
As suggested by Joreskog (1993), all items with squared
multiple correlations (SMCs) less than .40 were considered
THE STRUCTURE OF THE CES-D S263
unreliable if modification indices did not suggest that the
item may be more highly correlated with another latent
variable. SMCs indicate the percentage of variance in the
observed variable that is explained by all the latent vari-
ables in the model and is a lower bound estimate of the reli-
ability of the observed variable (Joreskog and Sorbom,
1988).
For initial models, all off-diagonal theta deltas were as-
sumed to be equal to 0. Theta deltas (6s) represent the corre-
lation between error terms of observed variables. Modifica-
tion indices may suggest that goodness-of-fit can be
improved by allowing theta deltas to be estimated. However,
MacCallum (1986) has argued that simply freeing parame-
ters to improve goodness-of-fit can capitalize on idiosyn-
crasies in the data and may lead to results that cannot be
replicated. Therefore, we decided, somewhat conservatively,
that a theta delta would be estimated in new models if the
modification indices suggested the correlation was greater
than .15. Our conservative approach was based on our find-
ing that smaller values for theta deltas did not tend to repli-
cate across random subsamples of our H-EPESE data. Simi-
larly, theta delta epsilon (8s*) correlations between the
exogenous variables and the items on the CES-D were fixed
to zero and were not freed unless modification indices sug-
gested that the correlation would be greater than .15. As
mentioned previously, correlations between exogenous vari-
ables and observed items are indicators of item bias.
RESULTS
Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFAs)
For the H-EPESE study, EFAs were conducted on each
of the subgroups identified by gender and language of inter-
view. Using the eigenvalue greater than 1.0 method, two of
the four EFA models identified four factors, one EFA had a
three-factor solution, and a fourth model for females inter-
viewed in English was an ultra heywood case -- the com-
munality estimate was greater than 1.0, making it impossi-
ble to determine a factor solution.
Textbooks on factor analysis argue that in addition to
using the eigenvalue greater than 1.0 rule, other indicators
of factor structure should be examined (e.g., examining
item loadings, scree plots, and percentage of variance
explained by each factor; Kim and Mueller, 1978). When
many items tend to load on more than one factor, this sug-
gests that the solution has too many factors, and models
with fewer factors should be tried. For the two four-factor
models and the three-factor model determined by the eigen-
value greater than 1.0 rule, the items associated with
well-being (see items 4, 8, 12, and 16 in Table 2) repre-
sented one clearly distinguishable factor. No well-being
items loaded greater than .40 on any other factor. For other
items, the distinction between factors was less clear, sug-
gesting that a solution incorporating fewer factors should
be tried. For Spanish-speaking males (N = 826), a four-fac-
tor model emerged in which items 1, 2, and 11 clearly
loaded on the first factor; items 3, 9, 10, and 13 loaded on
both the first and the second factors; items 7, 15, 18, and 20
loaded on the first, second, and fourth factors. Items 2 and 4
only loaded on the second factor, and items 5, 6, and 14
loaded on the first and fourth factors. Given the large num-
ber of multiple loadings, these results suggest that a model
with fewer factors is appropriate.
Similar results occurred for the other subgroups. For
English-speaking males (N = 236), items 1 and 2 loaded
only on factor 1, and items 13, 17, and 19 loaded only on
factor 2. Item 9 only loaded on factor 4. Items 5, 11, and 14
loaded on factors 1 and 2. Items 6, 7, and 18 loaded on fac-
tors 1, 2, and 4. Items 3, 10, and 20 loaded on both factors 1
and 4. For Spanish-speaking females (N = 1,162), a
three-factor solution emerged in which items 1 and 2 clearly
loaded on factor 1, and items 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17,
19, and 20 had loadings of .40 or greater on both factors 1
and 2. In sum, these results suggest that most items tend to
load on more than one factor, suggesting that the four-factor
and three-factor models include too many factors.
For English-speaking females (N = 312), the four-factor
model was an ultra-heywood case. Ultra-heywood cases
emerge because too many factors have been specified (Kim
and Mueller, 1978). Therefore, we tried a three-factor
model and the solution converged. Factor 2 included items
4, 8, 12, 16, and 17. However, two of these items (items 12
and 17) also loaded highly on factor 1. Factor 3 included
items 10, 14, and 15 with item 14 also loading highly on
factor 1. Other items only loaded on factor 1. Therefore,
this three-factor model also has multiple loadings suggest-
ing that a reduced model should be tried. Other evidence
that reduced factor models should be tried came from scree
plots in all four subsamples that suggested only two factors
were present.
When two-factor models were estimated using EFA,
items 4, 8, 12, and 16 all loaded on one factor and other
items only loaded on the second factor. There were no
cases, for any of the subgroups, where one item loaded on
multiple factors. Therefore, our EFA results suggest that for
all subgroups a two-factor model fits the data best. These
results also support the use of MIMIC models that require
no interactions between grouping factors. That is, there are
no interactions between the grouping factors because all
subgroups suggest the same two-factor model.
An EFA of the Three Generation Study also suggested a
two-factor solution for similar reasons as were found in the
H-EPESE data; for solutions with more factors, items
tended to load on more than one factor, and the scree plot
indicated a two-factor solution. Subgroup analyses were not
performed due to limitations imposed by sample size.
CFA for four-factor models. -- Despite the finding that a
two-factor model fit the data best, we decided to examine
both two- and four-factor models using CFA. Because a
four-factor CFA model for the Three Generation Study has
already been reported, we do not report these results. We
report the results of four-factor models for the H-EPESE
study that are representative of four-factor models found in
previous research. Table 2 presents the results for the
four-factor model proposed by Krause and Markides (1985)
based on the Three Generation data and the four-factor
model proposed by Radloff (1977), which has been repli-
cated in some studies (e.g., Hertzog et al., 1990). For each
factor analysis, we present the Cronbach's alphas (a) for

parentheses are the standard errors of the lambda coeffi-
cients. Next to the lambdas and SMCs for the final model, a
brief description of each item is presented. For each latent
variable, the first lambda was set equal to 1.0 to provide a
scale for the latent variable. Another lambda could have
been chosen without influencing the results.
The SMCs suggest that most items were reliable. Only
item 11 for the Krause and Markides (1985) model had an
SMC less than Joreskog's (1993) criterion of .40.
THE STRUCTURE OF THE CES-D S265
The correlations among the exogenous and latent vari-
ables are presented below the lambdas and SMCs. The
affect, somatic, and interpersonal subfactors were highly
inter-related; the unattenuated correlations between the
latent variables of somatic problems, negative affect, and
interpersonal problems ranged from .85 to .97. Similar find-
ings have been reported by Hertzog et al. (1990) and
McCallum et al. (1995) who found r's ranging from .80 to
.95. The well-being factor is riot as highly correlated with
other factors (r's range from .55 to .65). Age was not highly
correlated with any of the factors. Language of interview
was correlated with the depression factor so that those who
were interviewed in Spanish were more likely to be
depressed. Gender was modestly correlated with depression
such that women were more likely to be depressed and,to
also report less well-being. Well-being was negatively cor-
related with the depression factor because more well-being
is associated with less depression.
For all models, modification indices suggested no direct
effects from observed exogenous variables to observed en-
dogenous variables (theta delta epsilon), suggesting that the
models are reasonable for different levels of the exogenous
variables.
The goodness-of-fit indices are presented below the cor-
relation matrices (see Tabie 2). The goodness-of-fit indices
for Hertzog et al. (1990) suggest a moderately poor fit in
that all are below .91 and are slightly lower than those
reported by most other researchers. For example, Hertzog
et al. (1990) reported a GFI of .93 compared to our GFI of
.89. The Krause and Markides (1985) model fits the data
somewhat better for all goodness-of-fit indices.
Two-factor CFA models. -- Table 3. presents the results
of two-factor CFA models for the H-EPESE and Three
Generation studies. For the H-EPESE study, only item 11
had a low SMC (.32). For the Three Generation Study,
many SMCs were low (items 1, 4, 7, 13, 15, and 19). A pre-
vious CFA analysis of the Three Generation Study also
found that these same items had weak loadings (Liang et
al., 1989). In general, SMCs for the Three Generation
Study are similar to the H-EPESE study except that items
1, 4, 7, 13, 15, 16, and 19 have much lower reliability. One
potential explanation for the low reliability is the lower
level of education of the participants in the Three Genera-
tion Study as compared with the EPESE study. However,
when number of years of schooling was added as a back-
ground variable it was riot significantly correlated with
depression or well-being. Furthermore, a multiple groups
analysis with a median split of high versus low education as
the grouping factor found that subjects with less education
did not have lower SMCs.
Liang et al. (1989) did riot report the latent variable corre-
lation between their well-being and depression factors. For
the Three Generation Study sample, the latent variable corre-
lation (r = -.35) was lower than the correlation found in the
H-EPESE study (r = -.64); perhaps because some items
appear to be more unreliable in the Three Generation Study.
Other correlations between well-being and gender, and
well-being and language were also smaller in the Three Gen-
eration Study. However, the language Scaie was more highly
correlated with gender and age for the Three Generation
Study than language of interview was for the H-EPESE
study. All correlations between exogenous variables and the
depression and well-being latent variables were generally low
(see Table 3). We fixed to 0.0 standardized regressions
between exogenous and endogenous variables that were esti-
mated to be less than .05. In many cases, age was not corre-
lated with well-being or depression, so this element was fixed
to 0.0. These fixed elements appear as blanks in Table 3.
It is possible that the smaller correlation between well-
being and depression in the Three Generation Study may
have been produced by the use of MIMIC models. How-
ever, when we conducted a CFA without any exogenous
variables, the magnitude of the correlation between depres-
sion and well-being only dropped from -.36 to -.35. For
the H-EPESE study, this correlation increased from -.64 to
-.65. For the Three Generation Study analysis, without
exogenous variables, the SMCs varied but generally stayed
the same: 11 items had the same value, 5 improved, and 4
decreased in value. For the H-EPESE, SMCs slightly
improved -- 14 improved, 4 had the same value, and 3
decreased in value. For the Three Generation Study, good-
ness-of-fit slightly improved for all indices (GFI = .81; CFI
= .81; AGFI = .75; TLC = .77). For the H-EPESE, good-
ness-of-fit was slightly improved for the two indices and
decreased for two indices (GFI = .82; CFI = .97; AGFI =
.77; TLC = .96).
For the H-EPESE study, four modifications indices were
substantial enough to warrant inclusion in the final model.
Three theta delta error terms between items on the CES-D
were statistically significant. Theta deltas between items 1
and 2, items 15 and 19, and items 17 and 18 had correla-
tions of .18, .15, and .15, respectively. A theta delta epsilon
between gender and item 17 ("I had crying spells.") had a
standardized regression coefficient of .15, suggesting that
·women were more likely to report this item as being posi-
tive regardless of whether or not they were depressed.
For the Three Generation Study, the theta delta epsilon
between item 7 (I felt everything I did was an effort) and
the language scale was significant (r = .28) as was the cor-
relation between gender and item 4 (I felt I was just as good
as other people; r = .20). Theta deltas were significant for
items 15 and 19 (r = .35), items 17 and 18 (r = .20), items 9
and 13 (r = .19), items 10 and 13 (r = -.21), items 8 and 9
(r = -.25), items 9 and 1 (r = -.15), and items 10 and 4 (r =
.28). The only parameters that were significant across both
studies were the theta deltas for items 15 ("People were
unfriendly.") and 19 ("I felt people disliked me."), and
items 17 ("I had crying spells.") and 18 ("I felt sad.").
For the H-EPESE data, all goodness-of-fit indices were
slightly improved over the results for the Krause and
Markides (1985) four-factor model and were all fairly high.
Model fit should not improve if unnecessary factors are
added, so these results suggest that the more parsimonious
two-factor model is the best fit. Liang et al. (1989) also
reported their results for a subset of items from the CES-D
that loaded highly on at least one factor. When we
attempted a two-factor model on this subset of items, we
found that the goodness-of-fit indices were similar to their
reported three-factor solution (two-factor model: GFI = .93;

AGFI = .90; TLC = .91; three-factor: GFI = .94; AGFI =
.90; TLC = .92); Thus, their three-factor model does not fit
the data any better than the current study's more parsimo-
nious two-factor model.
For the Three Generation Study data, the goodness-of-fit
indices were lower when compared with the H-EPESE
data. Examining the SMCs for the Three Generation Study,
it appears that these lower indices are the result of several
unreliable items. Another possibility is that the lack of use
of an asymptotic covariance matrix reduced the goodness-
of-fit. When goodness-of-fit was examined without the use
of an asymptotic covariance matrix with the H-EPESE
data, goodness-of-fit decreased substantially (GFI = .86;
CFI = .88; AGFI = .83; TLC = .86). However, these esti-
mates are still higher than those found in the Three Genera-
tion Study, so the lack of use of an asymptotic covariance
matrix does not appear to account for the lower goodness-
of-fit in the Three Generation Study.
The SMCs for the H-EPESE were not greatly influenced
by the use of the asymptotic covariance matrix. Therefore,
the greater unreliability associated with not using an asymp-
totic covariance matrix does not account for the many un-
reliable (low SMC) items found in the Three Generation
data. Another possible explanation for the lower reliability
is the use of normalized scores. However, the SMCs and
goodness-of-fit were not substantially different when the
THE STRUCTURE OF THE CES-D S267
normalized scores for the CES-D items were not used for
both data sets. Therefore, it appears that some items on the
CES-D were reported more unreliably in the Three Genera-
tion Study.
DISCUSSION
The current study conducted a series of EFAs and CFAs
in an attempt to define the dimensionality of the CES-D in
a representative sample of elderly Mexican Americans liv-
ing in the Southwestern United States (H-EPESE) and
among the Mexican American elderly from an earlier Three
Generation Study (Markides et al., 1983). In both studies,
our EFAs found support for a two-factor structure of
depression and well-being. Our EFAs also found that item
loadings from the four-factor models did not replicate
across gender and language of interview. Many statistical
indicators suggested that less than four factors represent the
best structure for the CES-D among elderly Mexican Amer-
icans. The two-factor models replicated across both gender
and language of interview. Another argument in support of
the two-factor model is that statisticians recommend that if
goodness-of-fit is equal, the more parsimonious model is
most appropriate (Kim and Mueller, 1978). Our CFAs
showed that goodness-of-fit did not improve by allowing
more than two factors.
There are several possible interpretations of our results.
Our results may be viewed as supporting the argument that
in more traditional societies, such as elderly Mexican
Americans, depression may be viewed as a single construct
(Angel and Thoits, 1987; Dick et al., 1994; Weissman et al.,
1977) and there is not the typical separation of cognitive,
affective, and behavioral components identified in Cauca-
sion populations. Instead of these components, research
suggests that Hispanic beliefs about family, personal rela-
tionships, the effects of forces of good and evil on health
and well-being, and a present-oriented approach to problem
solving may have more relevance to Hispanic populations
(Villa et al., 1993).
A two-dimensional structure is also consistent with previ-
ous theory (Watson and Clark, 1984) and other depression
inventories (Aneshensel, Clark, and Fredrichs, 1983; Catan-
zaro and Salvatore, 1994; Tanaka and Huba, 1984; Volk,
Pace, and Parchman, 1993). In support of the two-dimen-
sional hypothesis, prior research on the CES-D has also
found a second-order structure with two factors (McCallum
et al., 1995; Sheehan et al., 1995). Future research is required
that uses the same methodology employed in the current
study in order to determine whether the differences in our
study are due to our CFA methodology or to differences in
the culture of our subjects.
For the H-EPESE study, the language in which the inter-
view was conducted was correlated with both depression
and well-being; those who preferred the interview in Span-
ish were more likely to be depressed and to report lower
well-being; r = .18). It has been suggested that the greater
levels of depression reported among elderly Mexican
Americans and Mexican American women may possibly be
due to their lower levels of acculturation into the larger
society (Golding and Aneshensel, 1989; Guarnacci, Angel,
and Worobey, 1989). Language of interview may be con-
sidered a proxy for acculturation, and the Three Generation
Study analysis included a language acculturation scale that
correlated similarly with depression (r = .22).
Correlations between the background variables varied
somewhat across studies. Gender was more highly corre-
lated with depression in the Three Generation Study (r =
.31) than the H-EPESE study (r = .10). Well-being was
negatively correlated with language of interview (r = -.22)
and nonsignificantly correlated with acculturation in the
Three Generation Study. The Three Generation Study
acculturation scale was more highly associated with gender
(r = .15) than the EPESE language of interview scale (r =
.01). Age was not highly correlated with either depression
or well-being. However, our sample only included subjects
over the age of 65. Associations between age and depres-
sion occur in samples that employ wider age ranges (Gatz
and Hurwicz, 1990).
Methodological Issues
One potential explanation for why researchers may have
reported four-factor solutions is that they used the eigen-
value greater than 1.0 rule. In our study, this rule yielded
solutions with too many factors. This finding also may
explain why four-factor solutions for the CES-D reported in
prior research have reported that some items load on more
than one factor (Liang et al., 1989).
In contrast to the H-EPESE study, some items for the
Three Generation Study sample were unreliable and were
found to not load on any factor. The unreliability problem
has occurred in many other studies [see Liang et al. (1989)
for a review]. The reason for the unreliability problem is
unknown. We found that differences in educational levels
across the two studies did not account for the unreliability.
Therefore, we cannot explain why some items had higher
reliabilities in the H-EPESE study.
Our results suggest that due to the skewed ordinal nature
of the CES-D items, the use of an asymptotic covariance
matrix will improve goodness-of-fit somewhat. We could
not use this procedure on the Three Generation Study sam-
ple because the suggested sample size for the use of an
asymptotic covariance matrix for the CES-D items is at
least 520 subjects. Therefore, future researchers interested
in conducting CFAs of the CES-D should include at least
520 subjects in their samples.
For the H-EPESE, we found item bias on only one item
("Do you have crying spells?"). Given the tendency for men
not to cry, it is not surprising that some gender bias occurs
on this item. We found no bias for age or language of inter-
view. For the Three Generation Study, several different
items had bias. Since we were unable to replicate these item
bias findings across studies and MacCallum (1986) has
argued that such specification searches can yield unreplica-
ble results, our findings of bias should be treated with cau-
tion until a consistent picture emerges from future research.
The theta delta parameters that are indicative of corre-
lated error terms were only significant across both studies
for two sets of items: one pair of items concerned with rela-
tionships with other people -- "People were unfriendly,"
and "I felt people disliked me" and a second pair -- "I had
crying spells," and "I felt sad." A correlation between theta
S268 MILLER ETAL.
deltas suggests that some of the correlation between these
items is not related to level of depression. Therefore, our
results suggest that scores on these items have some bias
because they do not entirely reflect depression but are also
influenced by other similarities between these pairs of items
(e.g., relationship stress).
The two-factor structure we report should not be assumed
to fit other nonelderly Mexican American populations. For
example, Hertzog (1989), using the same EFA methods as
used in this study, reported the results of two studies: one
sample of subjects aged 20 to 80 from a family practice
clinic (N = 437) and a second sample of volunteers aged 55
to 77 (N = 237). For the four-factor solution, four items had
loadings greater than .40 on the affect factor, four items
loaded on a well-being factor, seven items loaded on the
somatic factor, and two items loaded on the interpersonal
factor. For the second sample, the same four items loaded on
affect and the same three loaded on well-being, eight loaded
on the somatic factor including the same six that loaded on
the first data set, and the same two items loaded on the inter-
personal factor. Unlike our study, there were no variables that
loaded more than .40 on two or more factors. In addition,
Hertzog reported lower intercorrelations between the four
factors. Therefore, his results suggest that a four-factor
model fits his data. Nevertheless, Hertzog concludes:
A decision to use the four scales must face two issues: 1) the
scales will be highly intercorrelated and 2) two of the four
scales are based upon an unacceptably low number of items,
minimizing scale reliability (p. 290).
It may be argued that four-factor scales may still be use-
ful if they show divergent validity with other constructs.
Most prior research on Mexican Americans has found that
the strongest case for divergent validity occurs with the
well-being scale (Krause and Markides, 1985). However,
different patterns may emerge in other populations.
The new methods used in the present study were not avail-
able for most previous studies. Future researchers will have
to investigate whether the use of these new methods might
yield two-factor solutions in other samples. Nevertheless, our
comparative results suggest that differences in methods of
analysis had little to do with our findings. Although both of
our studies interviewed elderly Mexican Americans, there
were differences in the unreliability of some items. Further-
more, there were differences in the strength of correlation
between the factors and background variables that suggest
that the two samples are not equivalent. Future research will
have to determine what produces these differences that have
also been reported in other studies (see Liang et al., 1989).
Our study suggests the need to fully explore alternate
structures for the CES-D in different populations and to
evaluate the adequacy of different structures using multiple
criteria (e.g., scree plots and examining item loadings). The
results of the current study suggest that a two-factor model
of well-being and general depression is the best structure
for the CES-D among elderly Mexican Americans.
