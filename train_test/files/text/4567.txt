With globalization forces and the growing prominence of
online shopping (Ward & Ostrom, 2003; Yip, 2000), con-
sumers face greater exposure to novel products in categories
with which they have little experience. In the absence of hav-
ing past experiences or products to compare with, consumers
would be more dependent on marketing materials in forming
both explicit and implicit attitudes toward such products.
The goal of the current series of studies was to investigate the
effects of message elaboration and repetition on explicit and
implicit attitudes formation toward a novel product or brand.
Consumers typically rely on prior experience with the cat-
egory of product when making judgments about an instance
of novel product (Sujan, 1985). But if consumers lack famil-
iarity with the category of the product itself, the marketing
material may be the consumer's only source of information,
and hence, have a strong influence in shaping the formation
of attitudes. Existing literature address aspects of this pro-
cess (e.g., Gregg, Seibt, & Banaji, 2006; Zajonc, 1968), but
to our knowledge, studies have rarely examined the pattern
of explicit and implicit attitude formation when consumers
encounter a novel object in a novel category. Such under-
standing is necessary because the two types of attitudes
appear to effect different consumer outcomes. Whereas
explicit attitudes are associated with planned purchase
behavior, implicit attitudes are associated with purchase
behavior where cognitive resources are limited (Friese,
Wänke, & Plessner, 2006). If the pattern of explicit and
implicit attitude formation depends on the presentation of
novel objects, this implies different managerial implications,
depending on which kind of attitude formation is sought.
Our focus was on implicit attitude formation, and we
attempt to outline the conditions under which implicit atti-
tudes form, and provide reasons for why explicit attitudes
may or may not form concurrently with implicit attitudes.
The particular implicit attitude measurement model adopted
for this study was the Implicit Association Test (IAT;
Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998; see De Houwer,
Teige-Mocigemba, Spruyt, & Moors, 2009, for a discussion
of the nature of the "implicitness" of such measures). The
general pattern of findings using the IAT is that implicit atti-
tudes appear to be a function of the frequency with which
concepts are paired in one's environment, and hence, a func-
tion of the frequency with which concepts are perceived
(consciously or not) by the individual (Greenwald & Banaji,
1995; Karpinski & Hilton, 2001). This finding extends to the
consumer behavior domain in that the frequency of use of a

Seeing Something New: Effects of
Elaboration and Repetition on the
Pattern of Explicit and Implicit Attitude
Formation
Daisung Jang1 and Do-Yeong Kim2
Abstract
With the rise of online commerce, consumers come into contact with novel products in unfamiliar categories. Our aim
was to contribute to the understanding of explicit and implicit attitude formation by studying the effects of elaboration
and repetition as strategies for the formation of positive explicit and implicit attitudes toward novel brands in unfamiliar
categories. Across three studies, results indicated that explicit attitudes may form with both elaboration and repetition, but
the presence of competing products interfered with positive explicit attitude formation. Elaboration was not an effective
strategy for implicit attitude formation, but repetitive exposure of an object coupled with a positive valence was successful in
the formation of positive implicit attitudes. There may be dual routes to explicit and implicit attitude formation with different
consequences for managerial action. Limitations and managerial implications are discussed.

product reflects implicit attitude strength (Perkins, Forehand,
Greenwald, & Maison, 2008).
However, the studies along this line of research offer lim-
ited implications for understanding the pattern of explicit
and implicit attitude formation toward novel products in
novel categories because there has been a lack of focus on
strategies, other than frequency of presentation, in inducing
implicit attitudes for novel objects. Specifically, despite the
definition of implicit attitudes hinging on repeated associa-
tions between concepts, Gregg et al. (2006) and Perkins et al.
(2008) were able to induce implicit attitudes with exposure
to a single instance of a message, by invoking salient inter-
group processes (i.e., social identity processes, cf. Tajfel,
1982). A possibility based on these findings is that a single
but salient marketing message about a novel object could be
a sufficient condition for implicit attitude formation.
Although this proposition seems plausible, the presentation
of a novel object in an unfamiliar category, by definition, has
no meaningful relationship to any of the consumer's existing
set of knowledge, and may not serve as a cue to trigger salient
intergroup processes. More generally, without access to a
consumer's existing set of associations, a novel object in an
unfamiliar category is unlikely to evoke stored associations,
or be a trigger for interpersonal or intrapsychic processes
likely to increase the salience of the object.
Thus, one of the few plausible ways in which a single
exposure of a novel object in an unfamiliar category could
influence implicit attitudes would be the salience of the mar-
keting message itself. The literature suggests that the level of
elaboration may play a role in attitude formation toward
novel objects because when a piece of information does not
relate to one's existing set of knowledge, an increase in the
amount of provided information facilitates the degree of
influence of that information (Schwarz, 2004). If we extend
the logic to consider a consumer's response to multiple novel
objects in a novel category, it is possible that greater elabora-
tion of one object relative to another object (i.e., a brand
about which the perceiver has just received information
about vs. an unknown brand) may influence attitude forma-
tion, given that consumers base their purchase decisions on
the relative familiarity of an object (Hoyer & Brown, 1990;
Laroche, Kim, & Zhou, 1996).
We investigated the above propositions in Study 1. Red
wine was selected as a category that would be relatively
unfamiliar to the South Korean participants recruited because
it is not traditionally consumed, and consumers have little
information about specific products or the category in gen-
eral. That is, the participants would be relatively naive in
their conceptualization of wine, which implies participants
would rely solely on the materials presented to them in atti-
tude formation. Experiments 1a and 1b tested whether atti-
tudes toward a brand could be formed after a single exposure
to marketing material, whereas Experiment 1c sought to
determine if greater familiarity toward one brand relative to
another would influence implicit and explicit attitude
formation.
An alternate mode of attitude formation may lie in
repeated exposure to concepts. Investigations by Olson and
Fazio (2001, 2002) and Karpinski and Hilton (2001) showed
that repeated exposure to pairs of concepts could result in
either the formation or increase in the salience of implicit
attitudes. However, they do not speak directly to attitude for-
mation, as both studies investigated objects that had existing
associations with either positive or negative valences, and
neither were systematic about measuring explicit and implicit
attitudes at pretest and posttest. To overcome these limita-
tions, we directly test if implicit attitudes could be formed
through repeated exposure to a neutral object (novel product
in an unfamiliar category), and measure both explicit and
implicit attitudes at pretest and posttest to detect the pattern
of explicit and implicit attitude formation.
We investigated the role of repeated exposure in attitude
formation in Studies 2 and 3. In Study 2, to directly evaluate
the effects of frequency, we simulated the effect of repeated
exposure to marketing material through evaluative condi-
tioning. In Study 3, we attempted to determine whether such
repetition effects would be reflected in relation to existing
brands, by assessing the attitudes toward a national brand
versus a comparable foreign brand.
Study 1
Experiments in Study 1 address the following question: Does
salience of the material influence implicit attitude forma-
tion? Three experiments were conducted. Experiment 1a
testedtheeffectofsimulatedmarketingmaterials,Experiment
1b tested the effect of visiting an authentic-looking website,
and Experiment 1c tested the effect of having an unknown,
competitive product in the evaluation set. The study had one
desideratum--that marketing messages include no refer-
ences to already valenced attitude objects, to prevent indirect
valence transfer, as observed by Perkins et al. (2008).
Method
Participants. Participants were recruited from a private South
Korean university. One hundred and thirty-nine students (59
females; age M = 22.71, SD = 2.36) participated in Experi-
ment 1a, 82 students (12 females; age M = 22.28, SD = 2.32)
in Experiment 1b and 67 students (42 females; age M = 20.90,
SD = 1.97) in Experiment 1c. Overall, participants generally
reported minimal familiarity with wine. We attempted to
eliminate the effects of participants' preconceptions of wine
by measuring prior familiarity of wine, wine purchase, or
supposed familiarity with the brand of the wine at pretest. The
exclusion of participants who indicated any familiarity or
prior purchase of wine did not affect the pattern of results, so
all participants were retained in the analyses.

Overview of procedure. All studies followed a pretest/posttest
design with explicit and implicit measures collected at both
phases. In Experiment 1a, elaboration of marketing material
about a fictional brand of wine (Cultura) was manipulated.
After completing the pretest measures, participants were
assigned to one of four conditions: control, low, medium, and
high elaboration groups. In the low elaboration group (n =
33), participants were given a brochure (double-sided A4
size) containing information about the region in which the
grapes were cultivated, a short description about the wine,
and color photos of the wine bottle. In the medium elabora-
tion group (n = 36), participants were given the same bro-
chure accompanied by a bottle of wine with a fake, but
high-quality label. In the high elaboration group (n = 34),
participants were provided with an enhanced brochure, in
addition to being shown the bottle of wine. Inspection time
across these conditions was 5 min. The price of the wine was
omitted across conditions as it could be interpreted as a sig-
nal of quality (Lecocq & Visser, 2006). Participants in the
control group (n = 36) were instructed to take a 5-min break.
The inclusion of this no-activity control group assured
against practice effects known to occur with pretest/posttest
use of an IAT-type measure.
The objective of experiment 1b was to replicate experi-
ment 1a, while avoiding confounds present in the manipula-
tion materials. Most importantly, the authenticity was
enhanced by having participants search for the brand on
google.com and then visiting the supposed corporate website
(when in fact, the participants were actually directed to a
website controlled by the experimenters), providing authen-
ticity to the marketing message. Another potential confound
was that different modalities of marketing material (i.e., bro-
chures and wine bottles) could result in different consumer
outcomes (Kardes, Cronley, & Kim, 2006), so no tactile
materials were provided to the participants in Experiment 1b.
Finally, instead of presenting different kinds of information
across conditions, quantity of information was varied by
having participants view a website that was complete versus
those still under construction.
Participants assigned to the low (n = 26) and high (n = 28)
elaboration groups were told to perform a Google search on
a real, foreign brand of wine called Penfolds. The query
resulted in a large number of search results for the Penfolds
brand, which was visible to participants, affirming its status.
Participants were directed to click on the first of those search
results. Lab computers were configured such that clicking on
the top search result would redirect the participants to a web-
site controlled by experimenters. In the low elaboration con-
dition, participants were exposed to a website that was not
complete, with placeholder notices ("under construction") in
place of content. In the high elaboration condition, partici-
pants were exposed to a website that was fully furnished with
content in all sections of the website. Both versions of the
website were visually identical, with the difference in the
level of content available to the participant. In keeping with
the notion that Penfolds is a foreign brand, the website was
presented in English, but the participants were provided with
a Korean translation. In addition, to ensure that participants
would digest the information, they were given a short work-
sheet of questions to complete while browsing the website.
Participants were permitted 5 min to inspect the website
under low elaboration and high elaboration conditions.
Participants in the no-activity control group (n = 28) were
told to take a 5-min break.
Thus the aim of Experiment 1c was to determine the effect
of competing brands within an unfamiliar category. It is often
the case that when investigating a new category, consumers
are aware that there is more than one brand from which to
select. Our question was whether greater elaboration of one
brand relative to another would result in explicit and implicit
attitude formation. We minimally altered the protocols of
Experiment 1b, such that participants expected to be exposed
to two competing brands--Penfolds and Yalumba. Directly
after being exposed to the Penfolds brand, participants com-
pleted the posttest questionnaires. Twenty-three participants
were in the control group, 21 participants were in the low
elaboration group, and 23 participants were in the high elab-
oration group.
Explicit measures
Semantic differential. To assess the cognitive component of
the participants' attitudes toward Cultura/Penfolds/Yalumba,
the participants completed a semantic differential scale
(Experiment 1a, Cultura  = .85; Experiment 1b, Penfolds
 = .87; Experiment 1c, Penfolds  = .90, Yalumba  = .89)
consisting of the following eight pairs of words: Like/Dis-
like, Satisfied/Dissatisfied, Mild/Cold, Joy/Sad, Luxury/
Lowbrow, Graceful/Abject, Sophisticated/Trite, Happy/
Unhappy. The participants listed their answers on a 1 to 7
scale, with higher scores indicating positive cognitive evalua-
tions. Such semantic differentials have been used in previous
research, using the IAT (e.g., Brunel, Tietje, & Greenwald,
2004; Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2001), and we modified the
adjective pairs to reflect evaluative dimensions relevant to
consumer choice in Korea.
Thermometer scale. To assess the affective component of
their attitudes toward Cultura/Penfolds/Yalumba, the par-
ticipants completed a thermometer scale consisting of one
item ( = n/a; single-item scale), in which they indicated a
temperature between -50 to 50 degrees that reflected their
affects toward the brand, with higher scores indicating more
positive affective evaluations. We used this scale because it
made more intuitive sense to mark cold and hot tempera-
tures, given the use of the metric system in Korea. For ease
of interpretation and compatibility with previous uses of the
thermometer scale, we transformed this scale to range from
0 to 100 degrees.
For Experiment 1c, we assessed the extent to which par-
ticipants favored Penfolds over Yalumba. Therefore, the
4 SAGE Open
difference scores between the two semantic (Penfolds  =
.90; Yalumba  = .89) and thermometer ( = n/a; single-item
scale) scales were used as the dependent variables. Higher
scores indicated a more favorable evaluation of the Penfolds
brand.
Implicit measures
IAT.The IAT methodology (Greenwald et al., 1998)
was adopted to assess implicit attitudes toward Cultura
( = .79). Because there was only one object to judge, there
were two target categories: a Cultura category and a blank
category. Conceptually, if there is no contrasting concept, a
single-category IAT is the logical operationalization of the
IAT procedure (Bluemke & Friese, 2008; Brunel et al., 2004;
Kim, 2004). In essence, the blank category can be regarded
as a neutral baseline against which the Cultura concept can
be assessed. The evaluative categories were "Good" (with
warm, refined, birthday, happy, friendly, joy, and freedom
as stimuli) and "Bad" (with failure, ruin, tire, pain, dan-
ger, shortage, sadness, and poverty as stimuli). The newer
d-score scoring method (Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003)
was used in the final analysis. For Experiment 1b, a similar
measure was used, but with the Cultura category and stimu-
lus renamed to Penfolds ( = .89). For Experiment 1c, the
blank category was replaced with a Yalumba category ( =
.88). In all cases, the IAT scores were calculated such that
positive scores were reflective of greater preference toward
Cultura/Penfolds (i.e., the positively exposed brand).
Results
A series of ANCOVA procedures were conducted with the
posttest measures as the dependent variable, pretest mea-
sures as covariate, and a condition main effect (compar-
ing the different levels of treatment) as a between-subjects
variable. The critical result was the main effect of the
condition main effect. Table 1 shows the pretest and post-
test means of the measures in each of the experiments in
Study 1.
Cognitive attitude formation.Overall, the pattern of results
suggested that favorable cognitive attitudes toward a brand
could form toward a novel brand with only a single exposure,
but only if one novel object was presented. In Experiment 1a,
the analysis revealed a significant effect of condition, F(3,
130) = 10.86, p < .001, partial  2 = .20, with the low (adj.
M = 5.18, SE = .11, t(130) = 4.57, p < .001, d = .80), medium
(adj. M = 5.18, SE = .11, t(130) = 4.44, p < .001, d = .79), and
high conditions (adj. M = 5.26, SE = .11, t(130) = 4.94,
p < .001, d = .87) being significantly higher than controls
(adj. M = 4.49, SE = .11). However, there were no differences
between the manipulation conditions.
In Experiment 1b, there was again a significant effect of
condition, F(2, 77) = 18.82, p < .001, partial 2 = .33.
Although both the low (low adj. M = 5.55, SE = .11, t(77) =
5.84, p < .001, d = 1.33) and high manipulation conditions
(high adj. M = 5.34, SE = .11, t(77) = 4.55, p < .001, d = 1.04)
were significantly more positive than in the controls (adj.
M = 4.63, SE = .11), there was no difference between the low
and high conditions.
The introduction of an unknown competing brand resulted
in a different pattern of data. After the removal of an outlier,
there was no significant effect of condition, F(2, 61) = 2.18,
p = .12, partial 2 = .07, indicating no differences between
the low (adj. M = .73, SE = .23), high (adj. M = 1.37, SE =
.24), and control groups (adj. M = 1.25, SE = .23).
Affective attitude formation.Affective evaluations appeared
to be sensitive to exposure to a positive presentation of a
novel object when the marketing material had greater

authenticity and there was no competing product. In Experi-
ment 1a, where we used our fabricated materials, there was
no significant effect of condition, F(3, 130) = 1.51, p = .22,
partial 2 = .03, indicating no difference between low (adj.
M = 75.60, SE = 2.90), medium (adj. M = 73.89, SE = 2.94),
high (adj. M = 73.79, SE = 2.91), and control (adj. M = 67.66,
SE = 2.81) groups.
In Experiment 1b, when an authentic-looking website was
presented, positive affective evaluations for both low and
high elaboration were apparent. After exclusion of one out-
lier, analyses revealed a significant effect of condition, F(2,
76) = 12.15, p < .001, partial 2 = .24. Follow-up tests
revealed a favorable change in attitude toward Penfolds
under the low condition (adj. M = 74.58, SE = 1.94, t(76) =
3.42, p = .001, d = .78) and under the high condition (adj.
M = 77.70, SE = 1.85, t(76) = 4.75, p < .001, d = 1.09) com-
pared with controls (adj. M = 65.44, SE = 1.81). There was
no difference between the low and high conditions.
In Experiment 1c, no favorable affective attitudes formed
when a competing brand was present. Analyses for
Experiment 1c revealed a nonsignificant effect of condition,
F(2, 62) = 2.70, p = .08, partial 2 = .08, indicating no differ-
ences between the low (adj. M = 68.21, SE = 5.39), high (adj.
M = 68.82, SE = 5.25), and control conditions (adj. M =
52.76, SE = 5.13).
Implicit attitude formation. The pattern of results suggests that
a single exposure to a novel object did not result in implicit
attitude formation, even after increasing the elaboration of
the material. Across Experiments 1a, 1b, and 1c, none of the
condition main effects were significant--Experiment 1a:
F(3, 132) = 1.63, p = .19, partial 2 = .04, low (adj. M = .37,
SE = .06), medium (adj. M = .26, SE = .06), high (adj. M =
.19, SE = .06), and control (adj. M = .23, SE = .06); Experi-
ment 1b: F(2, 76) = 1.52, p = .23, partial 2 = .28, low (adj.
M = .30, SE = .07), high (adj. M = .14, SE = .06), and control
(adj. M = .19, SE = .06); Experiment 1c: F(2, 62) = .75, p =
.48, partial 2 = .02, low (adj. M = .12, SE = .06), high (adj.
M = .14, SE = .07), and control (adj. M = .22, SE = .06).
Discussion
With only one encounter, marketing materials may bear only
limited implications for explicit and implicit attitudes toward
novel consumer objects. In general, formation of explicit
attitudes could be achieved by providing marketing mes-
sages about a single product, but the presence of a competing
object appeared to neutralize the effectiveness of elabora-
tion. In contrast to the partially successful formation of
explicit attitudes, implicit attitudes could not be formed with
a single exposure to marketing message, despite attempts at
increasing elaboration. These results discount the role of
salience in implicit attitude formation and point to presence
of repeated associations between concepts being a more
plausible way to form implicit attitudes toward novel objects.
Study 2
The aim of this study was to directly test if an evaluative
priming procedure would be successful in inducing implicit
attitudes about a novel object. A crucial consideration is that
repeated exposure to an unknown brand may not, in and of
itself, form the basis for implicit attitude formation. This is
because the presentation of an unvalenced concept unaccom-
panied by other stimuli is a context in which associative pro-
cesses should not be activated, and thus, should not lead to
the formation of an implicit attitude. A strong test of this
hypothesis would be that implicit attitudes would not form
toward a brand that was exposed with the same frequency
but without simultaneous presentation with positive valences.
Unlike previous studies, we do not make comparisons
between two objects conditioned with either positive or neg-
ative valences (cf. Olson & Fazio, 2001, 2002) because that
operationalization is unrepresentative of the idea of novel
objects in an unfamiliar category.
The frequency of exposure to an attitude object with posi-
tively valenced concepts may also result in the formation of
explicit attitudes. Previous studies show repetitions of adver-
tisements enhance explicit attitudes toward the novel object
(Haugtvedt, Schumann, Schneier, & Warren, 1994; Schwarz,
2004), so compared with the presentation of a brand without
valences, the presentation of a brand with positive valences
should receive favorable evaluations by comparison.
Method
Participants and overview of procedure. Fifty-five students (14
females; age M = 23.55, SD = 1.93) from a private South
Korean university were recruited. After completing explicit
and implicit measures of their attitudes toward two brands
with which they were unfamiliar, the study participants were
randomly assigned to either the Penfolds or the Yalumba
exposure groups. After the manipulation, the participants
completed identical explicit and implicit measures at pretest.
As in Study 1, participants generally reported low familiarity
with wine or either of the brands. Moreover, as in Study 1,
excluding participants who had familiarity with wine, had
purchased wine, or expressed that they had previous knowl-
edge of the test brand had no impact on the pattern of data,
and thus were retained in the study.
Manipulation. In both conditions, participants were instructed
to memorize the pairs of words shown on the screen, as a
memory test would ostensibly be administered at the end of
the presentation. Participants were exposed to 100 pairings
of either Penfolds or Yalumba with one of five positive eval-
uative stimuli not presented in the IAT task (good, happy,
joy, hope, success--although some of these stimuli overlap
the stimuli for the IAT, they were close synonyms in Korean;
no direct English equivalent translations); one drawback of a
previous study of implicit attitude formation toward novel
6 SAGE Open
objects was that the concepts used in evaluative conditioning
and implicit attitude measurement were identical, thus con-
founding attitude formation with practice effects (Mitchell,
2004). The word pairings were presented such that the brand
name would be presented on either the left or right half of the
screen, and an evaluative word would appear on the other
half of the screen. The pairings were presented for 1 s each
on a computer screen, after which the word pairing was
obscured by an opaque white rectangle. The participant then
pressed a key on the keyboard to advance to the next pairing.
Presentation of the concept word and the positive evaluative
word was fully counterbalanced across different sides of the
screen. This procedure continued until the participant had
been exposed to all 100 brand-evaluative word pairings. This
procedure closely mimics the procedure used by Karpinski
and Hilton (2001), with the difference being that the current
study used pairs of novel objects with either positive or neu-
tral valences, whereas Karpinski and Hilton (2001) paired
known concepts with either positive or negative valences. In
addition, to ensure that mere exposure to the brand did not
influence the formation of the attitude, in the Penfolds expo-
sure group, the concept Yalumba was presented paired with a
white blank rectangle rather than an evaluative word for 100
exposures, and in the Yalumba exposure group, a white blank
rectangle was presented with the word Penfolds for a total of
100 exposures. Thus in each condition, participants were
exposed to 200 presentations of brand names. A separate
nonexposure control group was not included because the
question we wished to ask was if repeated positive exposure
to a brand would facilitate the formation of implicit attitudes,
compared with unvalenced repeated exposure.
Explicit and implicit measures. Measures were identical to those
in Experiment 1c. The difference score between the Penfolds
( = .81) and Yalumba ( = .63) semantic differential and ther-
mometer ( = n/a; single-item scale) scales and IAT ( = .89)
were adopted as the dependent variables, with higher scores
representing greater favorability toward the Penfolds brand.
Results
Explicit and implicit attitudes toward Penfolds versus
Yalumba.
ANCOVA was conducted with the posttest
measures as the dependent variable and pretest measures as
covariates, with a between-subjects factor of condition (Pen-
folds vs. Yalumba exposure). Table 2 shows the pretest and
posttest means of the measures.
Results showed that cognitive attitudes form for brands
presented with positively valenced concepts. Analysis on the
semantic differential showed that the effect of condition was
significant, F(1, 52) = 28.18, p < .001, partial 2 = .35,
thereby indicating that participants in the Penfolds (adj.
M =.92, SE = .27) and Yalumba exposure groups (adj.
M = -1.13, SE = .28) reported higher cognitive evaluations
of the brand to which they were exposed.
Affective attitudes showed a similar pattern. The effect of
condition was significant, F(1, 52) = 27.32, p < .001, partial
2 = .34, which indicates that participants in the Penfolds
(adj. M = 9.79, SE = 4.44) and Yalumba exposure groups
(adj. M = -23.64, SE = 4.53) liked the brand to which they
had been exposed.
Implicit preference for the exposed brand was also
observed. The effect of condition was shown to be signifi-
cant on the IAT, F(1, 52) = 5.55, p = .02, partial 2 = .10),
indicating a preference toward the positively exposed brand
in the Penfolds (M = .22, SE = .07) and Yalumba exposure
groups (M = -.004, SE = .07).
Discussion
Formation of explicit attitudes was facilitated by repeated
exposure to positively valenced concepts, with cognitive and
affective evaluations being favorable following exposure to
a simulation of repeated marketing messages. But merely
being seen (even repeatedly) is an insufficient condition for
positive implicit attitude formation. Viewed in the context of
the previous findings, the data indicate that favorable implicit
attitudes are dependent on the frequency of positively
valenced exposures, rather than on the salience of the
material.
Study 3
Although Study 2 showed that the frequency of exposure
coupled with positive valences could result in the formation
of implicit attitudes, it remains to be seen if the effects of

frequency on implicit attitude formation can be inferred
from implicit attitudes toward existing brands. One case in
which a clear difference in the frequency of exposure might
be expected is between a dominant national brand and a less
dominant foreign brand. Specifically, we compared explicit
and implicit attitudes toward comparable brands that are
well-known among Koreans--namely Samsung (a Korean
brand) and Sony (a Japanese brand). Both brands represent
large, multinational firms that compete in similar categories
and have a significant consumer presence. The data were
collected in the Korean city of Suwon, which also serves as
the headquarters for their electronics division, and it also
sponsors the local national-league soccer team. In addition,
Samsung is the largest company in Korea, accounting for a
considerable portion of the goods sold and economic activ-
ity in the country. We believed Koreans to have a higher
frequency of positive exposure toward Samsung as com-
pared with Sony, and anticipated that Koreans would have
more favorable implicit attitudes toward Samsung than
toward Sony.
Methods
Participants and overview of procedure. One hundred and thirty
participants (41 females; age M = 31.78 SD = 10.10) were
recruited from a private university in South Korea and com-
pleted explicit and implicit measures of Samsung and Sony
as well as demographic questions.
Explicit and implicit measures. The explicit and implicit mea-
sures mirrored those in Study 2, except that Samsung and
Sony were the target concepts in both the semantic differen-
tial (Samsung,  = .87; Sony,  = .86), thermometer scales (
= n/a; single-item scale), and IAT ( = .91). In all cases, posi-
tive scores represented greater preference toward Samsung.
If greater positive exposure to Samsung does lead to positive
attitudes, we would expect the means of the measures to be
positive and significantly different from zero.
Results and Discussion
We analyzed Koreans' explicit and implicit attitudes toward
Samsung versus Sony by subjecting the difference scores on
each of the measures to a one-sample t test. Cognitive atti-
tudes showed a preference for Samsung, M = .33, SD = .88,
t(129) = 4.31, p < .001, d = .76, as was also the case for affec-
tive attitudes, M = 9.31, SD = 18.38, t(129) = 5.77, p < .001,
d = 1.01, and the IAT, M = .40, SD = .38, t(124) = 11.72, p <
.001, d = 2.10.
Overall, the pattern of data is consistent with that of Study
2, indirectly suggesting that repeated exposure to paired con-
cepts could account for the formation of implicit attitudes.
The difference, however, is that the current study used famil-
iar brands. One interesting point is that participants would
have encountered the marketing materials showing each of
the brands in a positive manner. If merely being associated
with positive valences is responsible for implicit attitudes,
then Koreans should be indifferent in their comparative
implicit attitudes toward Samsung and Sony. The clear pref-
erence for one brand indicates the importance of relative
exposure frequency.
One plausible alternative explanation was that ethnocen-
trism may have been a factor in the implicit attitudes observed
(e.g., Shimp & Sharma, 1987; Verlegh & Steenkamp, 1999;
Watson & Wright, 2000). However, IAT-type measures are
relatively sensitive to the stimuli presented to the participant
such that, even with the same target concept, different
implicit attitudes may arise as a function of differently
valenced stimuli used in the measure (Bluemke & Friese,
2006; Govan & Williams, 2004; Kim, 2004). Because the
IAT we used did not contain references to national identities,
the associative link between one's country and brand may
not have been reflected in the responses. Although we
acknowledge that all sources of confounding effects cannot
be ruled out, it is difficult to eliminate such effects when
dealing with data on objects that exist in the wild.
General Discussion
Summary of Results
Across the experiments in Study 1, single exposures to mar-
keting material were shown to be effective in forming explicit
but not implicit attitudes toward novel attitude objects (new
brands). Furthermore, we detected some differences in
responses in the pattern of explicit responses. Although cog-
nitive attitudes could be induced, the degree of elaboration
did not result in differentiated attitudes (Experiments 1a and
1b), and the presence of competing brands (Experiment 1c)
resulted in no preference toward a novel brand about which
marketing efforts were expended. By way of contrast, we
observed that authenticity appeared to induce affective evalu-
ations (Experiment 1b), but it was also insensitive to the
amount of elaboration. The presence of a competing brand
appeared to erase the effects of authenticity, however. With
respect to implicit measures, single exposures to novel objects
did not appear to lead to the formation of implicit attitudes.
Studies 2 and 3 provided evidence that repeated presenta-
tion of a brand with positive valences could result in positive
implicit attitudes. Both controlled repeated exposures in the
laboratory and theorized differences in frequency of expo-
sure to one brand appeared to yield favorable implicit atti-
tudes.These studies also demonstrated that repeated exposure
contributed to favorable cognitive and affective attitudes.
The Pattern of Explicit and Implicit Attitude
Formation
In attempting to organize the current findings in the light of
previous research, we offer the following analysis. In our
studies, where the salience of the judgment was low, implicit
attitude formation was not influenced by single exposure to
8 SAGE Open
stimuli, but where sufficiently salient cognitive processes,
such as intergroup classification are invoked, a single expo-
sure may result in derivation of valence (cf. Gregg et al.,
2006; Perkins et al., 2008). Thus, if the novel brand is not
subject to influential cognitive processes, consumers may
require substantial exposure to novel brands paired with pos-
itive stimuli before implicit attitudes form.
We speculate that this picture may not be so simple
because explicit and implicit attitude formation may interact.
Brands with a heightened public profile may be judged as
having been socially validated, thereby indicating that the
brand (even if novel) offers goods that people prefer to con-
sume (Baker, Hutchinson, & Nedungasi, 1986), heightening
the salience of such information and implying an associative
link between the product and an ingroup. Furthermore, a
conscious decision to alter one's engagement to include more
exposure to certain associations (e.g., routinely choosing to
walk past an attractive billboard) could alter the availability
of the associations themselves. In short, although frequency
of exposure may directly lead to implicit and explicit attitude
formation, a variety of mediating and moderating effects
could exist.
Theoretical and Managerial Implications
We contribute to the literature on implicit attitudes by dem-
onstrating the pattern of explicit and implicit attitude forma-
tion. It has long been suggested that implicit attitudes are the
product of repeated associations between concepts
(Greenwald et al.,, 1998). Subsequent investigations have
shown that invoking salient intergroup processes can lead to
the formation of implicit attitudes (Gregg et al., 2006), but
relatively little attention has been given to how implicit and
explicit attitudes arise toward a relatively unfamiliar object.
Using the consumer behavior context allowed us to study
both explicit and implicit attitude formation, and to demon-
strate divergence in the formation of explicit and implicit
attitude formation. The key to understanding the formation
of attitudes is that implicit attitude formation is dependent
not on salience but on the relative frequency of the presenta-
tion of an object and a valenced concept, whereas explicit
attitudes can arise as a function of frequency and salience.
This pattern is strongly consistent with multiple routes to
attitude formation, one through elaboration and another
through repetition, with different consequences for explicit
and implicit attitude formation.
Based on our findings, we suggest an important caveat to
marketing actions. Managers who are interested in creating
favorable implicit attitudes, which appears to be associated
with nondeliberative purchase behavior (Perkins et al.,
2008), could adopt a marketing strategy focused on repeated
exposure of the product to the consumer. Focusing on elabo-
rate presentations to form implicit associations may not be as
effective without invoking salient intergroup processes.
Limitations and Directions for Future Research
A few points in these studies merit further consideration. We
recruited exclusively from a private South Korean university,
which is a relatively homogeneous population. We do not
know how the results would be affected by recruiting more
diverse populations and explicitly accounting for group dif-
ferences. Furthermore, we did not exhaustively vary the
salience of materials, nor did we define the boundary condi-
tions under which explicit and implicit attitudes form. In par-
ticular, although we decided on 100 exposures of a brand
coupled to a positive valence in Study 2, this number was
arbitrary. Previous investigations have met with success in
inducing implicit attitudes after associating concepts in a
range from 20 to 200 exposures (Baccus, Baldwin, & Packer,
2004; Karpinski & Hilton, 2001; Olson & Fazio, 2001, 2002;
Perkins et al., 2008). Future research should seek to deter-
mine the point at which implicit attitudes form. In addition,
we note that the vast majority of participants in Study 1 and
2 preferred alcoholic beverages other than wine. Therefore,
the participants in those studies may differ qualitatively from
typical consumers who are consistent in their preferred brand
of product and purchase behavior (Cobb & Hoyer, 1986).
