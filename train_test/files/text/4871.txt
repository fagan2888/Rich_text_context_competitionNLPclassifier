Introduction
In the presence of corruption we would expect citizens to
develop negative orientations towards political institutions
and to withdraw their support from corrupt politicians.
However, empirical studies do not provide a univocal
answer about the impact of corruption. Most studies iden-
tify a positive correlation between corruption, corruption
scandals and different forms of political discontent
(Anderson and Tverdova, 2003; Bowler and Karp, 2004).
However, in the case of the electoral punishment of corrupt
politicians, the identified effects of corruption range from
null to moderate (Jiménez and Caínzos, 2006).
We argue that there are three reasons that could explain
the diverging findings between studies of political attitudes
and political behaviour. First, due to the mutual causality
between measures of corruption and attitudes, previous stud-
ies might overestimate the negative effects of corruption on
political attitudes. Second, the impact of corruption on atti-
tudes might be limited in time. After a corruption scandal is
uncovered individuals might develop negative attitudes
towards politicians, but these attitudes might quickly
recover afterwards. Third, the attitudes of individuals who
sympathize with the corrupt politicians might not be affected
by their wrongdoings (Anduiza et al., 2013).
To assess these three possibilities, we exploit a natural
experiment generated by the coincidence of the uncovering
of one of the most relevant corruption scandals to have
occurred in Spain ­ the Bárcenas scandal ­ and the field-
work of the European Social Survey (ESS). The timing of
the survey is used as a source of exogenous variation in
corruption, which allows us to assess the causal effect of a
real-world corruption scandal on trust in politicians.
Moreover, through this design we can assess whether the
impact of the scandal decays, and also whether partisanship
moderates the effect of the scandal.
The corrosive effect of corruption
on trust in politicians: Evidence
from a natural experiment
Macarena Ares1 and Enrique Hernández2
Abstract
Empirical studies do not provide a univocal answer about the effects of corruption on political attitudes and behaviour.
Focusing on the relationship between corruption and political trust, in this article we explore whether real-world
corruption scandals have a negative causal effect on trust in politicians; whether the impact of scandals decays over time;
and whether corruption scandals have a weaker impact among the supporters of the party involved in the scandal. We
address these questions through a natural experiment generated by the coincidence of the uncovering of a corruption
scandal in Spain (the Bárcenas scandal) and the fieldwork of the European Social Survey. Given that the day at which
survey interviews were conducted is as-if random, the uncovering of the scandal represents a unique opportunity to
assess the causal effect of corruption on individuals' trust in politicians. The results indicate that: (i) the corruption
scandal had a substantial negative effect on trust in politicians; (ii) the effect of the scandal was stronger in the days
following its disclosure; (iii) the effect of the scandal was independent from individuals' partisan preferences.

2 Research and Politics 
Theoretical framework
Corruption scandals make the wrongdoings of politicians
known to the public. Confronted with these cases, individu-
als should update their attitudes towards politicians based on
their judgement of the behaviour of political authorities. This
is the hypothesis put forward by institutional theories, which
posit that attitudes like trust in politicians are endogenous to
the political system and depend on what political authorities
do (Mishler and Rose, 2001). Institutions that perform well
and produce desirable outputs should garner support, while
the misuse of public office should lead to distrust.
In line with institutional theories, studies have identified
a positive correlation between corruption, corruption scan-
dals and political discontent. Anderson and Tverdova
(2003), Mishler and Rose (2001) and Villoria et al. (2013)
uncover a negative association between aggregate meas-
ures of corruption, individual-level perceptions of corrup-
tion and individuals' political support. Studies addressing
the impact of specific corruption scandals have also
revealed a negative effect of corruption (Bowler and Karp,
2004; Chanley et al., 2000). The negative impact of scan-
dals is, however, not restricted to corruption. Kumlin and
Esaiasson's (2012) comprehensive analysis of scandals in
Europe reveals that different types of political scandals
generate political discontent (see Rottinghaus, 2014 for an
overview of the US literature).
Contrasting with the literature on political attitudes,
studies that analyse the electoral performance of politicians
involved in corruption scandals have only identified a mod-
est, or even null, effect of corruption on the electoral for-
tunes of these politicians. Voters seem to forgive corrupt
politicians since they are usually re-elected (Golden, 2006;
Jiménez and Caínzos, 2006). Corruption has a mild effect
on the electoral support of corrupt politicians across differ-
ent contexts like Spain (Riera et al., 2013), Germany
(Kauder and Potrafke, 2015), or Italy (Golden, 2006).
There are three possibilities that could help explain the
diverging findings in studies of political attitudes and
political behaviour. The first possibility is that the impact
of corruption on attitudes like political distrust might have
been overestimated. In previous studies corruption was
often operationalized through measures of scandal recall
or perceived corruption, either at the individual level
through survey items (Bowler and Karp, 2004; Villoria
et al., 2013), or at the aggregate level with indicators like
the Corruption Perceptions Index, which are also gauged
through cross-sectional individual-level surveys (Anderson
and Tverdova, 2003). The findings of these studies are
likely to be biased due to the mutual causality between per-
ceptions of corruption, scandal recall and political trust.
High perceptions of corruption, scandal recall and institu-
tional mistrust generate a vicious circle of mutual rein-
forcement that increases the difficulty of disentangling the
causal effect of corruption (Morris and Klesner, 2010).
Longitudinal and experimental designs can overcome
the endogeneity problems of cross-sectional designs.
However, one of the drawbacks of longitudinal studies is
that the measurement of attitudes is made months or even
years after the corruption scandal occurred (Chanley et al.,
2000; Pharr, 2000). This is problematic since the effects of
scandals are likely to weaken over time (see below). With
regards to experimental designs, while they provide robust
evidence of a causal effect of corruption on political atti-
tudes (Anduiza et al., 2013; Maier, 2011), their external
validity is limited. Since it is problematic to credibly
manipulate real corruption scandals, most experimental
research focuses on fictitious scandals. Therefore, any evi-
dence on the effects of real corruption scandals on repre-
sentative samples of the population is, thus far, limited.
We rely on a quasi-experimental design to overcome some
of these limitations and analyse if real-world corruption scan-
dals can influence trust in politicians. Drawing on institu-
tional theories, and based on the premise that corruption
scandals signal an abuse of the power entrusted by citizens to
political authorities, we expect that these scandals will under-
mine trust in politicians. If a scandal involves high-ranking
government officials, citizens should update their trust in
politicians. This leads us to our first hypothesis:
H1
: Exposure to relevant and salient corruption scandals
will reduce trust in politicians
Even if corruption scandals affect political attitudes,
these scandals might not entail an electoral defeat of cor-
rupt politicians if they have only a short-term effect on atti-
tudes that has vanished by the time elections take place.
The literature on media effects suggests that this might be
the case, since the information conveyed in the media only
exerts a short-term influence on public opinion (Gerber et
al., 2011). In fact, studies indicate that the effects of politi-
cal communications decay quickly (Hill et al., 2013).
Moreover, if we also take into account that individuals tend
to base their political opinions on top-of-the-head consid-
erations (Zaller, 1992), we can expect that corruption scan-
dals should inform individuals' trust in politicians to a
greater extent in the weeks following their disclosure. Since
the coverage of scandals should be more extensive just
after they have been uncovered, scandal-related considera-
tions should be more salient on individuals' minds during
those days. Therefore, the effect of corruption scandals on
political attitudes might be only short term (but cf. Doherty
et al., 2014). This leads us to our second hypothesis:
H2
: The negative effect of corruption scandals on trust in
politicians will be stronger in the days following their
disclosure and will decay over time
The influence of corruption scandals on political atti-
tudes and elections could also be mitigated if individuals
Ares and Hernández 3
react differently to scandals depending on their pre-existing
attitudes. Individuals' predispositions, like their partisan-
ship, make them react differently to political information
(Zaller, 1992). Those who identify with the party involved
in a scandal are likely to filter the information they receive
and attribute lower importance to that scandal. Anduiza et
al. (2013) have shown that partisanship moderates toler-
ance towards corruption. Individuals are likely to judge the
corrupt actions of politicians less severely if they are com-
mitted by politicians of the party they support. Therefore,
partisanship might condition how individuals react to a cor-
ruption scandal. This leads us to our final hypothesis:
H3
: The negative effects of corruption scandals on trust
in politicians will be weaker among the supporters of
the party involved in the scandal
The Bárcenas case
The Bárcenas case is one of the most relevant corruption
scandals occurred in Spain in the last decade. It became
widely known when the newspaper El País leaked internal
documents from the Partido Popular (PP) on 31 January
2013. The documents leaked by El País were facsimiles
written by Luis Bárcenas (the treasurer of the party) which
indicated that the party had received illegal contributions
that were used to pay cash bonuses to high-ranking mem-
bers of the party, among other irregularities. After the pub-
lication of these documents by El País, news of the scandal
was widely covered by national and international televi-
sions and newspapers. While news related to Bárcenas had
already appeared on 18 January in the newspaper El Mundo,
the leak by El País was the first to suggest that the scandal
affected not only the treasurer of the party, but also a large
number of high-ranking members of the PP. In fact, on 4
February PP Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy admitted that
`nothing was true, except for a few things' (referring to the
scandal documents).
To have a better picture of how the Bárcenas scandal
rapidly rose in salience on 31 January, Figure 1 summarizes
the relative frequencies of Google searches about the scan-
dal. As the graph shows, the maximum peak in searches
was reached the day El País leaked the bookkeeping docu-
ments. This is consistent with the great salience with which
this issue was covered in the Spanish media.1 The figure
also reveals that there was an increase in the number of
searches when El Mundo presented a piece about Bárcenas,
but the issue became then less salient only to peak at the
end of January, coinciding with the disclosure by El País of
the Bárcenas documents.
Data and methods
The empirical analyses draw on data from the sixth round
of the ESS, which was fielded in Spain between 23 January
and 12 May 2013. Following the research design proposed
by Legewie (2013), we capitalize on the coincidence of the
uncovering of the Bárcenas scandal and the ESS field-
work.2 Our quasi-experimental identification strategy relies
on the assumption that the timing at which respondents
were interviewed is as-if random, so that the uncovering of
the Bárcenas case provides an exogenous source of varia-
tion for levels of corruption. As such, the day at which the
interview was conducted assigns respondents to the treat-
ment and control groups. The sample is split so that those
who were interviewed before the scandal are assigned to
the control group and those who were interviewed in the
weeks following the uncovering of the scandal are assigned
to the treatment group. Therefore, the treatment variable Di
is operationalized as follows:3

An assumption of this identification strategy is that the
timing of the survey is exogenous, and hence independent
of other third variables that could affect trust in politicians
(ignorability assumption). Potential threats to this assump-
tion come from the differential reachability of the sampled
respondents. If factors that determine reachability are
related to political trust, there might be systematic differ-
ences in trust that are unrelated to the treatment. To assess
the plausibility of this assumption, we conduct balance
tests on several pre-treatment variables.
Table 1 summarizes the results of the balance tests for
the following pre-treatment covariates: years of education
completed, gender, age, employment status, and having
Figure 1. Google trends for the search `caso barcenas'.
4 Research and Politics 
voted for the winning party (PP) in the last election.4 Most
covariates are similarly distributed within the control and
treatment groups. The only statistically significant differ-
ence between the two groups appears for employment sta-
tus. There are more respondents in paid work in the
treatment group and more respondents outside of the
labour market in the control group. There is also a slight
imbalance between the treatment and control groups with
regard to age (p-value = 0.06). Overall, these tests suggest
that the potential selection bias (reachability bias) exerts
only a minor influence on whether individuals were inter-
viewed before or after the scandal, and provides further
support for the characterization of the event as a natural
experiment.
To analyse the effect of the scandal we fit a series of
OLS regressions in which trust in politicians is specified as
the dependent variable. Trust in politicians is measured in
an 11-point scale where 0 means no trust at all and 10
means absolute trust. Besides the treatment variable Di
the
models also include controls for the pre-treatment covari-
ates summarized in Table 1 and region fixed effects. Region
fixed effects are included to account for the fact that some
regions are not present in the control group.
Results
The effect of the corruption scandal (H1
)
Figure 2 summarizes the levels of trust in politicians (a
moving average of 2 days) during the months of January
and February. The x-axis ranges from -10 to 30, and the
value 0 corresponds to 31 January. There is a substantial
drop in trust in politicians on 31 January. Before the
Bárcenas scandal the average level of trust in politicians
in the control group is of 2.3 points. After the scandal was
uncovered, the average trust in the treatment group is of
1.8 points. Thus, there is a -0.5 difference between the
two groups, a reduction in trust that is quite remarkable
given the already low levels of trust of Spanish citizens
before the scandal.
Table 2 summarizes the results of the regression models.
The treatment indicator Di
of model-1 shows that respondents
who were interviewed after El País uncovered the Bárcenas
scandal have, on average, lower trust in politicians. The dif-
ference is of 0.48 points and statistically significant. Model-2
incorporates the pre-treatment covariates and region fixed
effects. In this model the difference between those who were
exposed to the Bárcenas scandal and those who were not is of
-0.45 points. This difference is larger than the difference
between election winners and losers, which is a common pre-
dictor of trust in politicians. Hence, in line with our first
hypothesis, these models indicate that the Bárcenas scandal
had a substantial negative impact on trust in politicians.
Changes in the treatment effect over time (H2
)
To test H2
we estimate a series of regression models in which
we progressively enlarge the treatment group by 5 days, while
the control group stays always the same (those interviewed
before 31 January). For the first estimation, the treatment
group only comprises those interviewed on the week immedi-
ately following the scandal (31 January to 6 February), for the
second estimation we also add respondents interviewed in the
next 5 days (i.e. from 31 January and 11 February). We con-
tinue enlarging the treatment group by 5 days at each estima-
tion until the final date of the fieldwork (12 May) is reached.
This allows us to analyse if the treatment effects decay as we
incorporate to the treatment group individuals interviewed
further away from the day when the scandal was uncovered.
The model estimated to test this hypothesis is specified with
the same covariates of model-2.5
Figure 3 summarizes how the estimate for Di
changes as
individuals interviewed at a later point in time are incorpo-
rated to the treatment group. The trend line in Figure 3 dis-
plays a decay of the effect over time. When we restrict the
treatment group to those interviewed just after the scandal
was uncovered, the difference in trust in politicians between
those who were exposed to the scandal and those who were
not is of 0.50 points. As we incorporate to the treatment
group individuals interviewed further away from the

scandal, the size of the coefficient Di
decreases in size. In
fact, when those interviewed in May are incorporated to the
treatment group, the effect shrinks to -0.32 and is no longer
statistically significant. These results support the idea that
the scandal informed citizens' evaluations of the trustwor-
thiness of politicians to a greater extent on the weeks that
followed the publication of the Bárcenas documents.6
Treatment effect heterogeneity (H3
)
To analyse the moderating role of partisan predispositions,
in model-3 of Table 2 we interact the treatment indicator Di
and the election winner variable, which measures whether
the respondent voted for the PP in the last national elec-
tions.7 Although partisanship (i.e. being close to PP) would
be a more adequate indicator of partisan predispositions,
we rely on the party voted for because partisanship could be
affected by the corruption scandal. The interaction coeffi-
cient indicates that there are no significant differences in
the effect of being exposed to the Bárcenas scandal between
those who voted for PP and those who did not. Hence, con-
trary to our expectations, the effects of the corruption scan-
dal are not moderated by partisanship.
Robustness checks
One of the threats to the ignorability assumption comes
from the differential reachability of respondents. To assess
the robustness of our results against this potential bias, we
include in our analyses information about the number of
times an individual declined to reply to the survey after
having been contacted, which serves as a proxy for respond-
ents' reachability. Our estimates are not altered by the
inclusion of this variable in our models (Table A2, supple-
mentary materials).8 Moreover, some Spanish regions were
only surveyed (reached) after treatment. Therefore, we re-
estimate all our models including only regions with
respondents in both the treatment and control groups. The
results indicate that our conclusions are not altered when
considering only these regions (Table A2, supplementary
materials).
Our identification strategy also assumes that the effect
of having been interviewed before or after 31 January on
trust in politicians goes only through the treatment (condi-
tional on covariates). This assumption could be threatened
by other unobserved factors that might change through time
and affect trust in politicians. To evaluate this threat, we
simulate 1000 placebo events that mimic our analyses of
the Bárcenas scandal (i.e. control group comprises 8 days
before the event and treatment group comprises 28 days
after the event) but take place between 1 February and 14
April. We compare the effects of these placebo events with
those of the Bárcenas scandal. It is reasonable to expect that
a small proportion of the simulated events will produce
results that are similar to the ones obtained with the original
event, because some simulated events fall close to the date
Figure 2. Change in trust in politicians at the time of the Bárcenas scandal.
6 Research and Politics 
when the Bárcenas scandal was uncovered. The results of
the simulation add further plausibility to our causal esti-
mate of the corruption scandal, since only 4.8% of the sim-
ulations produce a negative statistically significant effect
similar to the one of the Bárcenas scandal (see appendix,
supplementary materials for further details). Besides the
simulation, we also assess the impact of the original treat-
ment Di
on alternative dependent variables that should not
be affected by the Bárcenas scandal, for which we do not
find any significant effect of the treatment (Table A5, sup-
plementary materials).
As an additional robustness check, we replicate our
analyses using the seventh round of the ESS. Since no cor-
ruption scandal was uncovered during the first days of the
fieldwork of the seventh round, and interviews started on
23 January (like in the sixth round), this is an ideal way to
test that our findings are not driven by aspects related to the
timing of the fieldwork. We estimate the impact of a ficti-
tious event that occurs on 31 January 2015. The results
indicate that this event has no impact on trust in politicians
(Table A6, supplementary materials). Furthermore, since
the fieldwork of ESS-6 in Denmark coincided with the
fieldwork in Spain, we follow Pollock et al. (2015) and use
Denmark as a counterfactual and test the impact of the
Bárcenas scandal among Danes. The Bárcenas scandal had
no impact on trust in politicians in Denmark (Table A6,
supplementary materials).
Finally, we also consider alternative methods to estimate
the effects of the scandal. We estimate the effects through
coarsened exact matching and entropy balancing (Blackwell
et al., 2009; Hainmueller, 2012), as well as through a
regression discontinuity design. The results obtained with
these methods lead us to the same conclusions (Tables A7,
A8 and A9, supplementary materials).
Conclusion
The natural experiment exploited in this paper provided a
unique opportunity to estimate the causal effect of a real
corruption scandal on trust in politicians with a great degree
of internal and external validity. In line with institutional
theories, our results indicate that the corruption scandal

significantly reduced individuals' trust in politicians. These
results diverge from Kumlin and Esaiasson's (2012), who
conclude that political scandals involving only one party do
not influence attitudes towards the political system.
Through our design we also analyse the decay of the
effect of the scandal. The results indicate that the impact
of the corruption scandal on political trust was not long-
lasting, since it influenced individuals' trust in politicians
more strongly in the weeks immediately following its dis-
closure. This finding might explain why corruption scan-
dals have only a moderate or null influence on the electoral
fortunes of corrupt politicians. This intuition seems to be
supported by the performance of the party involved in the
Bárcenas scandal in the 2015 and 2016 Spanish elections.
Three years after the scandal was uncovered the PP lost
some support in these elections but remained the most
voted party.
Finally, our results indicate that the effect of the corrup-
tion scandal was not weaker among the supporters of the
party involved in the scandal. The low baseline levels of
trust in politicians in Spain prior to the scandal, especially
among those who do not identify with the PP (average =
2.1), could explain this null finding. Low levels of trust
might have predated the impact of the scandal for those not
supporting PP, since for them there was already little trust
in politicians to be lost before the scandal.

the number of articles mentioning Bárcenas in El País
(extracted from Lexis/Nexis). The analyses reveal that, in the
period from 1 January to 15 May the correlation between
the two equals 0.73 (p<0.001). Moreover, the peak of news
about Bárcenas occurred precisely between 31 January
and 5 February, when El País published 174 articles about
Bárcenas. Hence, for Spain, Google trends appear to be an
appropriate measure of the salience and attention devoted to
a certain issue.

the Bárcenas scandal on satisfaction with government.
3. We do not include respondents interviewed after 28
February in the treatment group because we expect the
treatment to affect trust in politicians among those who
were interviewed closer to the date of the treatment. To test
H2
and validate this intuition we expand the original treat-
ment group and include all respondents interviewed after
30 January (see below).

computing means comparisons between the original control

6. We conduct additional analyses in which we divide the
sample into three separate groups: those interviewed before
31 January, those interviewed between 31 January and 28
February, and those interviewed between March and May.
The analyses confirm that the treatment effect decays for
those interviewed after 28 February (see appendix B, sup-
plementary materials).
