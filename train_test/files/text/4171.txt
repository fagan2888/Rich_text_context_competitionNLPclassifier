Abstract
Using the contingent valuation method, we estimate residents' ex ante and ex post
willingness to pay (WTP) for hosting a large international sport event: The "big start"
of the 2016 Giro d'Italia, which was held in the Gelderland region of the Nether-
lands. The percentage of residents with a positive WTP changed from 29.7% before
the event to 39.3% immediately after the event, while average WTP increased sig-
nificantly from 3.58 to 4.45, leading to an increase of residents' valuation from
5.8 million to 7.1 million. Additionally, following the event in the media and
attending the event play an important role in explaining residents' WTP.

result, more research has been focused on the intangible effects of sport events, in order
to explainthe continuedinterestofgovernmentstohostand payfor theseevents (Coates
& Szymanski, 2015). These intangible effects of sport events include effects such as
happiness, excitement, and pride (De Nooij & Van den Berg, 2013). The intangible
impacts of a sport event, for the population of a nation or region, can be measured
through the contingent valuation method (CVM), by asking individuals about their
willingness to pay (WTP) for hosting the event (Atkinson, Mourato, Szymanski, &
Ozdemiroglu, 2008). Most of this event-related research has been on residents' WTP
before the event. However, ex ante valuations may under- or overestimate residents'
WTP at or immediately after the event. To gain a better insight in possible shifts in the
residents' valuationofanevent,weexamineboth the exantewilling topay (WTP0) and
ex post willing to pay (WTP1) for a large sport event. Using panel data, we are able to
distinguish between ex ante and ex post valuations within a single research population
as well as between visitors and nonvisitors of the event.
The case of interest for our research is the "big start" of the 2016 Giro d'Italia,
which was hosted in the Gelderland region of the Netherlands. The Giro d'Italia is
the second largest cycling event in the world, after the Tour de France. It is a 3-week
event for professional elite cyclists that is part of the international Union Cycliste
International (the world cycling governing body) World Tour. First held in 1909, its
20-odd stages attract hundreds of thousands of spectators along the course, and
millions of followers of the event on the TV and (social) media. The so-called
Grande Partenza, or big start, of the first stage or stages has occasionally been held
outside Italy. Interested cities or regions are invited by RCS Sports (part of RCS
Media, formarly know as Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera), the owner of the Giro
d'Italia, to bid for hosting this big start. The privilege to host the 2016 Grande
Partenza was acquired by the regional government of the Gelderland province in
the Netherlands, along with the three municipalities of Apeldoorn, Arnhem, and
Nijmegen, all located within the Gelderland province. The 2016 Grande Partenza
consisted of a Team Presentation on May 5 (in Apeldoorn) and three race stages
from May 6 until May 8. The three municipalities were all assigned a stage start and
a stage finish, while the courses (up to 190 km per day) were situated almost
completely within the Gelderland area. Gelderland has approximately 2 million
inhabitants (Statistics Netherlands, 2017). Although no specific permanent sport
facilities had to be created, organizational costs for the local organizing committee
were considerable, amounting to 12.4 million (De Boer et al., 2016). These costs
included side events such as amateur cycling events and school projects to promote
cycling for children. The regional and local governments paid around 9 million,
while the national government contributed 2.5 million. While around 10% of the
budget was spend on side events, public funding amounted to 93% of all income of
the organizing committee (De Boer et al., 2016).
The Giro d'Italia big start can be classified as a major spectator event (Type B in
the Gratton & Taylor (2002) classification). The event attracted approximately
482,500 visitors and gained significant national and international media attention
2 Journal of Sports Economics XX(X)
(De Boer et al., 2016). Held in the public space, the event was free to access, except
for a few stands for sponsors and VIPs. Therefore, the big start can be viewed as a
public good, since it is characterized by nonexcludability as well as nonrivalry in
consumption (Downward, Dawson, & Dejonghe, 2009). Because of the nonexclud-
ability, it is hard for the organizers and policy makers to extract the utility enjoyed by
attendees of the event. For that reason, revealed preferences--as would be evident
by tickets sales--were not measurable, and we had to resort to the more indirect
measurement of CVM.
Many studies have valued the intangibles of upcoming large or major sport
events. Much less is known about the actual valuation during or after sport events.
As such, an ex ante estimation may either be an overvaluation or be an undervalua-
tion. This study investigates if there is a gap in residents' WTP to host an event
before and immediately after a large sport event, in this case, the big start of the 2016
Giro d'Italia. Our research question is does the residents' WTP1 for hosting a large
sport event as the big start of the Giro d'Italia differ from the ex ante valuation?
Additionally, we will investigate which factors affect these WTPs, and whether
different factors are related to WTP at different times. Apart from socioeconomic
variables, we also analyze whether usage of the event, both in attending the event
and following the event in the media, contributes to a residents' WTP. This research
will contribute to the understanding of differences between WTP0 and WTP1 for a
sport event as well as factors that are related to the intangible effects. The outcomes
will be valuable for public policy makers that may bid for hosting events as well as
event organizers.
The plan of this article is as follows. In the Literature Review section, we present
some relevant literature, while the approach of the CVM that we use is put forward
in the Method section. We present the data and the empirical results of our models in
the Data and Results section. Finally, in the Discussion and Conclusion section, we
present the conclusions, implications, and limitations of our research.
Literature Review
There is little evidence that the economic benefits exceed the economic costs of
large-scale sport events (Baade & Matheson, 2004; Coates & Szymanski, 2015). A
literature review by Porter and Chin (2012) shows that, in the 40 articles they
investigated, no consistent positive economic impacts from mega sporting events
exist. With this knowledge, economists like Coates and Szymanski (2015) have
wondered why cities and countries are often eager to bid to host the Olympics or
the World Cup. They argue that public funding for major sport events may be
justified by intangible effects (see Maennig & Porsche, 2008). Kavetsos and Szy-
manski (2010) have shown that a feel-good factor was significantly associated with
hosting major soccer events. Sporting events can have several potential intangible
benefits such as civic pride, community spirit (e.g., Johnson, Mondello, & Whitehead,
de Boer et al. 3
2007), and happiness (Kavetsos & Szymanski, 2009). Other intangible effects of
sport events are associated with an increasing image of the host country, feelings of
national pride, and improved development of the elite sport system, although these
factors have been scarcely researched (Wicker, Hallmann, Breuer, & Feiler, 2012).
CVM
To measure the value of the nonmarket dimensions in sport events, the CVM can be
used. The CVM tool uses surveys in which the respondent is presented with a
hypothetical scenario and then asked to state his or her WTP for the public good
described in that scenario (Walker & Mondello, 2007). According to Baade (2006),
the rationale for the public funding of sport events relies on this contingent valua-
tion. The method originates from environmental economics and has been adopted in
other research fields dealing with nonmarket goods such as health economics. Since
2000, CVM has become a regularly used method to estimate the intangible values in
sport and is often used for measuring citizens' valuation of hosting sport events.
Almost all research on the WTP for sport events has been in advance (ex ante) of an
actual or planned event, often the Olympic Games. Both Atkinson, Mourato,
Szymanski, and Ozdemiroglu (2008) and Walton, Longo, and Dawson (2008)
demonstrated a WTP0 among UK residents toward funding for the 2012 London
Olympics. Four years before the actual event, they estimated the total intangible
value to UK residents at approximately £2 billion (around 2.4 billion). Although
substantial, this was well below the total public cost of hosting the games of almost
£9 billion (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2013). Heisey (2009) researched
residents' WTP for hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics in Berlin, San Francisco,
and Chicago. He found an average individual WTP varied from 16 for Berlin to
$36 (31) for San Francisco and $55 (48) for Chicago. Using a German nationwide
online survey, Wicker, Whitehead, Mason, and Johnson (2016) estimate the average
individual WTP for the 2024 Olympic Games over a 5-year period at 51 per month
or over 3,000 in total.
Very little research has been done after an actual sport event, which raises the
question whether the WTP0 still holds for the actual or WTP1. To our knowledge,
Heyne, Suessmuth, and Maennig (2007) present the only research of the WTP prior to
as well as after a sporting event, in their case the 2006 Soccer World Cup in Germany.
They find that total WTP increased by 129% after the event and conclude that sporting
events therefore may be viewed as experience goods. Additionally, Ma, Ma, Wu, and
Rotherham (2013) demonstrated that, from a behavioral perspective, local residents'
perceptions of mega event impacts vary pre-, during-, and postevent. This raises the
question whether the "usage" of the sport event may explain the residents' valuation.
Use and Nonuse Values
According to Barget and Gouguet (2007), the `use value' corresponds with the utility
actually felt by the consumer at the sport event. Other values that contribute to the
4 Journal of Sports Economics XX(X)
total economic value of sporting events constitutes are the optional value (utility felt
by people about the possibility of benefiting from the sporting event in the future),
legacy value (long-lasting infrastructures as well as satisfaction felt as a result of
handing down a sporting event to future generations), and existence value (utility
from knowing that the event exists). These all represent values for nonusers. Allmers
and Maennig (2009) argue that sport events may have a "nonuse effect,"' which also
has to be considered. This is the benefit for the host country's population, even for
those individuals who do not visit the event. Reasons for benefits without experien-
cing the sporting event might be, among others, the increased topics of conversation
and an increased national pride. The differences in valuation of an event between
users and nonusers have first been demonstrated by Andersson, Armbrecht, and
Lundberg (2012) for a music festival. This approach, developed in environmental
economics, has been successfully applied to culture (Armbrecht, 2014), but just very
rarely in sports (Allmers & Maennig, 2009). In sports, Wicker et al. (2016) have
shown that for German football teams different factors for attendees and nonatten-
dees affect the decision to support the local team and the actual amount of WTP.
Vekeman, Meulders, Praet, Colpaert, and Van Puyenbroeck (2012) demonstrated
that sporting events, such as large cycling events, may have a value both for users,
those who attend the event, and nonusers, those who do not visit the event.
Many sport events (including the Giro d'Italia) attract much media attention and
media coverage may play an important role in the public's perception of sport events
(Gratton, Shibil, & Coleman, 2006). Thus far, the aspect of following the event in the
media has not been incorporated in WTP research. It is also absent from Barget and
Gouguet's descriptions of any of the use and nonuse values. Only event visitors are
included in the use value, so perhaps media following may be considered an implicit
part of the "existence value" of an event. Therefore, to addresses a gap in the
literature, we include media following in our research as an explanatory factor for
WTP in addition to the actual attendance of the event.
Method
To measure the WTP for nonmarket goods, two alternatives exist: the revealed pre-
ference method and the stated preference methods. The revealed preference method
establishes WTP from observed behavior of the purchase of complementary or sub-
stitution goods. At best, this method can only provide estimates for the use value of an
event (Vekeman et al., 2012). Because of the possible existence of intangible aspects,
including nonuse values such as happiness or pride, the WTP is more appropriately
measured by the stated preference method. Also, in the absence of ticket sales for the
big start of the Giro d'Italia, demand could not be measured through revealed pre-
ference, so we had to resort to an indirect measurement method.
Following similar research on cycling (Vekeman et al., 2012) and other sport
events such as the Olympics (e.g., Coates & Szymanski, 2015, Wicker et al., 2012),
de Boer et al. 5
we adopt the CVM, in which respondents are questioned directly about their WTP.
The CVM uses surveys to measure an individual's WTP for a good or service
(Coates & Humphreys, 2008). According to Carson (2000), this survey-based
method is very appropriate to place "monetary value on environmental goods and
services not bought and sold in the marketplace" (p. 1413). A disadvantage of CVM
is the hypothetical bias, or the tendency of respondents to overstate their WTP. To
address this issue, we incorporate an extensive and realistic reasoning for contribut-
ing to the event. To assess the WTP for hosting the big start of the Giro d'Italia in
Gelderland, a standardized questionnaire was developed in which respondents are
presented with a hypothetical situation. Following the advice of Mitchell and Carson
(1990) to present a realistic scenario, inhabitants of Gelderland were ex ante pre-
sented with the following hypothetical situation:
As a result of the bankruptcy of a major sponsor of the "big start" of the 2016 Giro d'Italia,
the organization has a major shortfall in the budget for the event. To still have the cycling
race take place in Gelderland, residents are asked to contribute. If the total contribution of
the public is insufficient, the Giro Start will be moved to Italy. What is the maximum
amount of money that you personally are willing to contribute to maintain the start of the
Giro d'Italia for Gelderland?
In the ex post research, this scenario was adjusted to the past tense and the
respondents were asked to imagine the following, slightly altered, scenario:
As a result of the bankruptcy of a major sponsor of the "big start" of the 2016 Giro d'Italia,
the organization had a major shortfall in the budget for the event. In order for the cycling
race to take place in Gelderland, residents were asked to make a donation. If the total
contribution of the public was insufficient, the Giro Start would have been moved to Italy.
What is the maximum amount of money that you personally would be willing to contribute
to have preserved the start of the Giro d'Italia for Gelderland?
We have chosen for the scenario of a bankruptcy, because in early 2016, several
well-known Dutch brands (such as Vroom & Dreesmann, HEMA, and McGregor)
went bankrupt or were in danger of being liquidated. Therefore, in our view, a
bankruptcy presents a likely but exogenous reason to ask respondents for a private
donation. Since governments at several levels (local, regional, and national) were
already financially committed to the event, the alternative of including a case for
public subsidies in our scenario was problematic.
The survey question considering WTP can be formulated either as open-ended
question or by using a dichotomous choice format. Green, Jacowitz, Kahneman, and
McFadden (1998) point out that a dichotomous approach has an anchoring effect
which may distort the outcomes severely and conclude that an open-ended question
most likely provides more information on the WTP. Castellanos, Garci
´a, and Sa
´nchez
(2011) confirm this finding in the sport context for the support of funding for a local
professional football club. We therefore used the open-ended question for the purpose
6 Journal of Sports Economics XX(X)
of our research. We assume that the strategic bias--the tendency of respondents to fill
in a lower than real value in fear of having to really pay the amount on a later date--to
be negligible because as we added an element of voluntariness to the WTP question.
The survey was conducted using the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social
Sciences (LISS) panel of CentER data at the Tilburg University. The LISS panel is a
representative panel of the Dutch population2 and consists of around 8,000 individuals
from ca. 5,000 households. The LISS panel consists of persons aged 16 and older. Our
research was aimed at all the panel members from the Gelderland province. This
amounted to 880 panel members. LISS works with 4-week panels. Respondents were
questioned about 2 months before the event, from March 7 to April 3, 2016 (T0); and
immediately after the event from May 9 to June 6, 2016 (T1). At both instances,
persons who had not yet participated got a reminder up to 2 times. In total, 719 people
participated in the first survey, of whom 642 also filled in the second survey (overall
response rate of 73%). After eliminating incomplete surveys, the final data set con-
sisted of 572 respondents that filled in the questionnaire on both T0 and T1.
In this article, we want to establish whether the WTP1 is different from the
WTP0. We found no work on this difference besides Maenning (2007), who found
a substantial increase in WTP at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. However, it
must be pointed out that the German population experienced this event as particu-
larly successful in terms of sporting success as well as the feel good factor and social
impact (Ohmann, Jones, & Wilkes, 2006). Ma et al. (2013) showed that residents'
perceptions of an event changes over time, but this change varies between different
groups of residents. Based upon these results, our hypothesis is that WTP can
change, but the direction is not clear. Therefore, we use a two-sided test when testing
the null hypothesis that no change between WTP0 and WTP1 occurs.
Our second objective is to find a relationship between visiting the event and
following the event in the media on the one hand and WTP on the other hand. Since
Walton et al. (2008) showed that the potential attendance was positively related with
WTP0, our hypothesis is that (an intention to) visit the events leads to a higher WTP.
This is backed up by Andersson et al. (2012) who showed that for a music event
there exists a significant and positive use value. Following the findings of Ma et al.
(2013), we assume that people who follow the event in the media are doing so
because of a positive interest in the event. Therefore, our hypotheses are that there
is a positive relationship between both visiting the event and WTP as well as
between following the event in the media and WTP.
Table 1 shows the dependent and independent variables in our data panel. The
dependent variables are the WTP0 and WTP1. Standard socioeconomic variables
that have shown to be significant indicators for WTP in sport, were included. These
were gender, age,3 education, and household income (see, e.g., Atkinson et al., 2008;
Wicker et al., 2016). Additionally, sport-specific dummies were included for persons
participating at least 12 times in the last 12 months in sports in general and in cycling
specifically. Finally, dummies for both visiting the event and following it in the
media have been included in both realization (at T1) and intention (at T0).

panel members was 26.4%, while the visit intention was 19.9%. Over half of the
respondents (52.8%) followed the event in the media, while 47.2% intended to
follow it 2 months prior to the event.
The results show that the average WTP was 3.58 before the event and 4.45 after
the event. This is an increase of 24.3%. The Wilcoxon-signed rank test for compar-
ing matched samples (that are not normally distributed) dismisses the null hypoth-
esis that WTP0 has the same median as WTP1 (p < .001). The average WTP1 for the
persons that had a WTP0 of 0 was 2.08. This increase was significant (p ¼ .002).
By contrast, the average WTP1 of the persons with a positive WTP0 decreased by
2.02 compared with their average WTP0. However, this change was not significant
(p ¼ .17). The average WTP of the persons who were willing to pay something
decreased from 12.06 (for all people with a WTP > 0 at T0) to 11.30 (for all people
with a WTP > 0 at T1).
Table 3 shows the number of respondents who were willing to pay something for
hosting the event. This percentage changed significantly (p < .001) from 29.7% ex
ante to 39.3% ex post. Of the persons that ex ante did want to pay something for the
event 23.6% did not want to pay anything after the event. Vice versa, a similar
percentage (23.5%) of the persons that ex ante did not want to pay anything for the
event did want to pay something ex post. The w2 test shows that the ex ante and ex post
probabilities for a positive WTP differ significantly (p< .001). Hence, the timing of
contingent valuation measurement of a sport event is important for its outcome.
Further analysis shows that the gaps in WTP between persons (with the intention
of) attending and nonattending the events, as well as (with the intention of)

following and nonfollowing the event in the media, were significant and large both
at the ex ante and ex post measurement. However, the change in WTP between the
ex ante and the ex post measurement was not significant for any of these subgroups.
With two possible outcomes (yes or no) and two moments of measurement (ex
ante and ex post), it is possible to distinguish between four groups of people,4 for
both attending the event (Table 4) and following it in the media (Table 5). Analysis
of these groups shows a significant increase in WTP for people who visited the event
but had no intention to do so. For all other groups, no significant change in WTP was
measured. Additionally, within the group of persons with an intention to visit the
event, persons who actually did visit the event had a significantly (much) higher
WTP than those who in the end decided not to attend. This finding is also replicated
in the group of people with the intention of following the event in the media but not
in the groups with no intention to visit or follow the event.
We use regression modeling to measure the effect on WTP of covariates such as
visiting or following the event. For a CVM data set with a relative large number of
zeroes, a Tobit regression model can determine the effects of the independent vari-
able on WTP. Alternatively, a hurdle model could be considered if a respondent's
WTP anything at all depends on other factors than the actual amount of payment,
especially with a relative large number of zeroes (Castellanos, Garci

2011). Preliminary analyses showed that the same covariates are relevant in explain-
ing the amount as well as whether or not one is willing to pay at all. For this reason,
the Tobit model was preferred to a hurdle model to estimate effects of the socio-
economic, sport-related, and "use" variables on residents' WTP. For both T0 and T1,
several Tobit models have been estimated, the outcomes of which are shown in
Tables 6 and 7.
For both the ex ante and ex post regressions, four models are represented: a
simple model with only visit and media as explanatory variables (intention at T0,
realization at T1; Model 1); a full model with all explanatory variables (Model 2);
and two final models with the use of backward elimination (dropping all variables
with p > .05), one model with visit, but without media (Model 3), and a second final
model with both visit and media use at T1 and intention at T0 (Model 4).
The results show that visiting the event and following the event in the media are
important determinants of WTP, as both are highly significant predictors (p < .01) of
WTP and the outcomes are robust for different model specifications. This holds true
for both the ex ante and the ex post models. Also, the coefficients of the media
variables in all Models 1, 2, and 4 are larger than those of the attendance variables,
both for T0 and T1. Additionally, net household income has a positive and signif-
icant relation with WTP, whereas gender and sport participation are not significantly
related with the WTP0.
Discussion and Conclusion
The main aim of this research was to provide an ex ante and ex post contingent
valuation of a large sport event, the big start of the 2016 Giro d'Italia in the Gelder-
land province in the Netherlands. Two months prior to the event and in the month
immediately after the event are presentative panel of residents from Gelderland was
asked to state their WTP for the event. The average WTP0 was 3.58, while the ex
post average was 4.45, a difference of 24%. The results show that the ex ante and ex
post chances of a positive WTP increased significantly from 29.7% to 39.3%. A
simple extrapolation of these results would lead to a total ex ante valuation of this
event of 5.8 million for the 1.6 million adult residents of the host area of

Gelderland, rising up to 7.1 million after the event. Also, the Wilcoxon-signed rank
test shows that the medians of the WTP0 and WTP1 significantly differ. These
findings echo those of Heyne et al. (2007) who also found a significant increase
in WTP after the 2006 Football World Cup.
Our research shows that ex ante contingent valuations of the intangible effects of
sport events may be an underestimation of the actual or ex post valuations. However,
we would be extremely cautious to generalize these outcomes to other events.
Moreover, we would not rule out the possibility of ex ante overestimations, since
the difference in valuation may be a reflection of, for example, the level of success or
other characteristics of the event. Also, the nature of WTP1 measurement is vulner-
able for overestimation, since the hypothetical bias (as discussed in Walker &
Mondello, 2007) is much more likely to occur after than before the event. Using a
panel for the longitudinal approach for the CVM may limit this ex post effect.
Another limitation of our research is the one-sided focus on positive externalities
in willingness to pay, which does not allow for negative externalities. Our study does
not take into account that a part of the region's residents may be willing to pay for
not the hosting of the event (see, e.g., Hausman, 2012). This may be more concern-
ing for a large-scale sport event crossing many public roads as the Giro d'Italia than
for smaller events or those taking place in a demarcated area such as a stadium.
Although the Tobit model addresses the zeroes in the data statistically, the results
may therefore have a realistic upward bias. Additionally, the respondents may not be
truly representative of the whole population. The use of a panel leads to a relatively
small number of nonrespondents. Nevertheless, nonresponse could be for a sign of
no interest, and thus a WTP of less than or equal to the mean WTP values of our
sample. In that case, the presented WTPs could be interpreted as an upper bound
estimate (see Johnson, Groothuis, & Whitehead, 2001).
Only for visitors of the event who initially had no intention to do so, a significant
change between WTP0 and WTP1 is measured. Analysis also showed that within the
group of persons with an intention to visit the event, average ex ante WTP was much
higher for the individuals who actually did attend than for those who did not attend
and a similar pattern was found for persons with regard to following the event in the
media. While the first finding suggests that attracting visitors who initially had no
intention to do so can increase WTP, the second finding means that, for people who
say they have an intention to visit or follow the event, WTP0 maybe a predictor of
the likelihood of actually visiting or following the event. To explore which other
factors determine a person's actual behavior toward a sport event, in relation to
WTP, more research (with a larger sample size) is needed.
Results of the Tobit regressions show that both visiting the event and following
the event in the media lead to a significant higher WTP. Remarkably, the effect of
the latter is larger than the former, both in intention (ex ante) and in realization. The
regression results indicate that, at the individual level, media use is more important
than visiting the event for residents' valuation of the event. In Table 6, visit intention
has a higher coefficient in Model 3 than in Model 4. Table 7 shows similar results for

visit use and media use. These outcomes implicate that the model without a variable
for media following (intention or realization) may overestimate the effect of attend-
ing the event. At the same time, that model may underestimate WTP for people who
follow the event in the media. Our research shows that media usage for the valuation
of the intangibles of an event such as the Giro d'Italia (free to visit but also free to
watch on the television) may be more important than actual visiting the event, not
only because it had a higher impact at the individual level but also because it is
applicable to a larger share of the population (53% vs. 26%). Media coverage and
media consumption of a sport event can therefore have a strong influence on the
public's valuation of that event.
We conclude that the timing of the measurement of WTP affects the outcomes,
which is valuable information, in particular for policy makers who have to decide
whether or not to host or organize an event. Most of the variance in the total
valuation can be attributed to a shift of people who went from a WTP of nill to
a positive WTP. This can in part be contributed to the persons who visited or
followed the event but did not have the intention to so. In this case, the ex post
measurement was conducted immediately after the event. Later measurements
may show other outcomes, with a fading memory of the event, as well as conse-
quences of the event (such as financial implications) may have an effect on res-
idents' valuation. An assessment whether WTP1 is stable over time and is beyond
the scope of this article.
Further research is needed for explaining differences between WTP0 and
WTP1 for sport events. Specific research questions may include "`what event
and nonevent factors determine a person's change from zero WTP to a positive
WTP?" and "what causes can identify nonvisitors among the persons with the
intention of visiting or following the event?" This research should also include
other factors, such as the weather the (chances of) success of local participants
or a home team or competitive balance, as has been suggested by Nalbantis,
Pawlowski, and Coates (2017). The outcomes, in combination with more com-
bined WTP0 and WTP1 studies, may help explaining and predicting the "real"
WTP. We furthermore advise to include media consumption of an event into a
broader concept of use, to complement the traditional "narrow" perception of
use, which only includes actual visiting the event. Our findings show that media
following, and therefore media coverage, can play a very important role in the
residents' perception of a sport event's value, which is important information for
both public policy makers and event organizers with regard to the bid, prepara-
tion, execution, and evaluation phases of events. To get a better understanding
of the role of media coverage and media following in the valuation of events,
more research is needed.
