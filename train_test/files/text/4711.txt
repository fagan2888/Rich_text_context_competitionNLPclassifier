Introduction
The French Hospital Case: An Adoption of the
Bicephalous Governance System
The instance of the French Public Hospital has been taken
into consideration primarily for two reasons; first the present
reforms in the governance of the French hospital industry
having a national topicality, and second, the adoption of the
dual board structure in the form of the new two-tier gover-
nance system by the French board hospital.
The current reforms in the governance of hospitals in
France under the French Health Care Code 2010 (from the
Article L6143-1 to the Article L6143-8) have a nationwide
implication. By introducing a change in the ruling board, the
reforms have instigated a debate among the physicians,
patients, and authorities.
Industry in France has been the main reason for choosing
this industry for the purpose of this research. The recent French
Health Care Code 2010 (from the Article L6143-1 to the
Article L6143-8) requires public hospitals to substitute the
unitary system (the board of directors) with the dual one (the
supervisory and the management boards) under the aegis of
the reform known as "Loi, Hopital, Santé, Patients, Territoire"
(The HSPT). This change in the structure of governance is
one of the most important reforms in the history of the French
hospital governance structure change. Until recently, the gov-
ernance of organizations (public and private) in France has
been predominantly characterized by the unitary board sys-
tem.As the private firms have benefited from the option of the
dual board structure (Mallin, 2007, p. 172) since the reform of
the "droit des societies" (the Companies Law) in 1966, the
French legislator is keen on adopting the dual system for the
public hospital board, as well. According to the health care
authorities, by changing the governance system, the public
hospitals would be able to achieve the desired performance
objectives. The main point is that the supervisory board (SUB
hereinafter) and the management board (MGB/Mgt. hereinaf-
ter) constitute the basis of the hospital governance reforms. As
far as the SUB is concerned, some observers of the French
hospitals' governance say that the decision-making power, as
determined by the law, seems to be in favor of the MGB and
precisely the director. It is felt that the role of SUB is being
undermined as the government wants the director to be the
highest ruling authority within the French public hospital.

Convergence of Corporate and Public
Governance: Insights From Board Process
View
Gérard Hirigoyen1 and Radhoine Laouer1
Abstract
By analyzing the differences between the corporate and public governance, theoretical and empirical research seems to
indicate that the two domains of governance are far too different to share any common aspect. However, in this particular
research, it has been argued that public governance is an application of corporate governance. Thus, the research question
entails the description and analysis of this possible convergence of the two. Extensive research from literature on corporate
governance has been undertaken to establish a relationship between the boards process and the roles that acts as a framework
to bridge the gap separating corporate governance from public governance. Corporate governance, at a global level, exists in
the for-profit as well as nonprofit organizations. Thus, the definition of this concept needs to be viewed from "an innovative"
eye, considering the relationship between the process of the board and roles as characteristic of the public organization
and private ones. As the private as well as public organizations are an application of corporate governance, the difference
between the two gets narrowed. For the purpose of this research, the case of the French hospitals' board has been taken
into consideration. The members of the public board have been considered for the board process to perform their roles.

In the light of this French public hospital topicality, the
research aims to establish that the board process can create a
convergence between public and private governance. The
research first describes the theoretical background for this
convergence, and then offers the board making process as a
practical suitable alternative.
Theoretical Background
The Nonprofit and the Public Governance as "an
Application" of Corporate Governance
In the first stage, the public sector is considered as a set of
production units including firms, programs, agencies, and
departments such as the social security administration,
railways, national health care, education, and national
defense. Each unit is supposed to use a limited number of
resources within a particular institutional and geographical
setting and produce a number of outputs, quantitative and
qualitative. Those outputs are related to the objectives that
have been assigned to the production unit by the principal,
the authority in charge, that is, the government. However,
private-sector organizations are entities that operate on a
for-profit basis and include the private industry or com-
mercial sector units like the large- and medium-sized phar-
maceutical companies, small firms, and biotechnology
start-ups.
Corporate governance refers to the mechanism by which
the owner of the corporation governs and regulates the activ-
ities of the managers. Another way to understand the concept
of corporate governance is the manner in which the suppliers
of finance to corporations assure the flow of a return on their
investment. This conceptualization remains valid for the
public as well as the private sectors. Even though this defini-
tion of corporate governance concurs with the objective of
the private sector, it is equally valid for the public organiza-
tions. In the public sector, the suppliers of finance are the tax
payers who assure a safe return in the form of services of the
public administration.
Gortner, Nicols, and Ball (2006) argued that "Thus, far
we've addressed the differences between public sector, non-
profit organizations and the for-profit organizations. This is
the key to understanding organization theory from the public
and non-profit organization's perspective" (p. 44). This cita-
tion is in concordance with the Figure 1 that implies that when
authors conduct research on the nonprofit organization gover-
nance, they generally evoke the cases of the public and the
private sectors simultaneously. However, researchers deal
with the private sector when they take an interest in the for-
profit organization governance. Thus, this categorization high-
lights a kind of "governance profiling," and the classification
of organizations as public, nonprofit, or private, in which each
category is supposed to adopt a specific governance model.
Again, researchers define corporate governance in rela-
tion with "the corporation" (Shleifer & Vishny, 1997, p. 737;
Zingales, 1998, p. 498). Therefore, if Jegers (2009, p. 144)
states that "the word `Corporate' in Corporate Governance is
no longer restricted to Non-profit and For-profit
Organizations," that is, the corporations, he defends
"Corporate Governance as confined to non-profit
Governance." This necessitates the assessment of corporate
governance at a global perspective. Moreover, this change in
the interpretation of the term Corporate, transforms the
importance of the concept as a theory, as it considers all the
possible spheres of an organization. In fact, the passing from
the for-profit arena to the nonprofit or public one underlines
the prevalence of corporate governance as a theory. Following
the definition of the term "application" given by the Oxford
Dictionary (4th edition, p. 47), as the "Act of putting a the-
ory, discovery, etc. to practical use," the corporate gover-
nance that emanates from corporation studies or practices
can also be applied to any organization. Thus, with some pre-
cautions, corporate governance can be identified as a theory
that embraces the nonprofit as well as the for-profit
organizations.
These precautions are not inferred from the theory, but,
depend on the specific characteristics of each organization
found in Figure 1. The first precaution may be defined in
terms of conceptualization: For example, authors analyze the
governance of nonprofit or/and for-profit organizations in
the light of the stakeholders, which forms an important
branch of corporate governance. They specify that each orga-
nization has its stakeholders and with a small distinction of
shareholders as "a denomination" of those who try to defend
their own interests on behalf of the owners of the firm, as a
for-profit organization.
The second precaution may be defined in terms of impli-
cations such as problems; as given by Glaeser (2002), "the
non-profit organizations have governance problems that
resemble the problems faced by for-profit firms, but are often
more extreme" (p. 54).
Figure 1. The possible spheres of the corporate governance.
Hirigoyen and Laouer 3
The third precaution relates to safeguarding the interests
of the stakeholders as the statute of the organization is
changed, for instance, transforming the organization from a
public entity to a private one (privatization). According to
the stakeholder's approach, this may increase, decrease, or
even change the nature of the stakeholders, without changing
their ultimate goal, which is defending their own interests.
In addition, in terms of the adoption of corporate gover-
nance insights by the nonprofit organizations, Alexander and
Weiner (1998) tried to determine the required conditions
within the nonprofit hospital industry. Likewise, Alexander,
Young, Weiner, and Herald (2008) have studied the possibil-
ity of applying the Sarbanes­Oxley Committee's firm gover-
nance codes to the same industry. According to the
committee's codes, private companies listed in the United
States and their directors have to obey various norms relating
to disclosure and internal control, subject to significant pen-
alties, including imprisonment. As it is applicable to all pub-
lic-listed companies, U.S. companies and non-U.S.-listed
companies in the United States, these companies are now
required to submit an annual report of the internal accounting
controls to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The authors recognize that
Although Sarbanes-Oxley does not apply to non-profit
corporations, the legislation has been an impetus to policy
makers to consider whether non-profit should be subject to
similar types of governance requirements, as a number of these
organizations have also been involved in widely publicized
scandals. (Alexander, Young, Weiner, & Herald, 2008, pp.
199-200)
This reasoning further establishes that the overlapping and
the distinguishing zones between nonprofit and for-profit are-
nas, even with governance theories, other than the stakehold-
ers' theory, point toward the application of corporate
governance to the for-profit as well as the nonprofit organiza-
tions. The corporatization of an organization is the adoption
of those assumptions, and therefore, it is different from the
concept of privatization, in the sense that organizations may
corporatize their governance mechanisms without privatiza-
tion (Aivazian, Ge, & Qiu, 2005). Consequently, this research
on corporate governance proposes to study different mecha-
nisms that are applicable to nonprofit as well as for-profit
organizations. Moreover, when authors have to classify these
mechanisms, they choose the organization as a frontier
between external mechanisms (the market, law and economy)
and internal mechanisms (the board, committees and manage-
rial incentives). Given that this research article does not pro-
pose to analyze all of these mechanisms and/or their
efficiencies or inefficiencies (Walsh & Seward, 1990), it is
herein suggested to emphasize the possibility of applying
some of the corporate governance insights from the private
sector to the public organization's board. It can be argued that
the public and the private governance can interchange
between them some of the mechanisms of governance. In this
sense, Benz and Frey (2007) contended that the firm's gover-
nance can learn and gain from the public governance and vice
versa. Indeed, the two authors encourage the private field,
under the scandals--which infected earlier its Governance--
to adopt some lessons from the public domain in terms of
"manager compensation," "the division of power within
firms," "rules of succession in top positions," and "institu-
tionalized competition in core areas of the corporation."
This research first deals with some specificities of public
governance concerning the board of directors. Then, the
research evokes how the board process, as described by the
corporate governance literature, influences the performance
of the public board by analyzing the functioning of the
French Hospital Board.
In What Ways Is the Public Board Specific?
The term "governance," in the public sphere, has been empha-
sized through the doctrine of "New Public Management"
(NPM), with Hood (1991) stating that "it is the result of the
marriage between the Neo-Institutional Economic approaches
(public choice, transactions cost and principal-agent theories)
and the Managerialism perspective" (p. 6). According to
Kickert (1997) "The Public Management should be broad-
ened into Public Governance" (p. 732). This implies that the
NPM and the governance theory in general, share some of the
institutional, economic, and theoretical roots such as the
Transactions'Cost Theory and the agency theory. While those
theories are an emanation of corporate governance, they seem
to constitute the basis of the nonprofit governance as well. In
fact, Cornforth (2006) remarked that the nonprofit and public
governance are "relatively under-theorised" and enunciates a
panel of corporate governance theories likely to explain some
aspects of the nonprofit and public boards (p. 6). Besides, in
their work, Stone and Ostrower (2007) argued that the
Nonprofit governance and public governance are "fluid and
overlapping," and the breakable limits between the two
spheres get manifested by the fact that the governance litera-
tures of both firms are almost the same, and drawn from the
for-profit governance research. Thus, the corporate gover-
nance research has a certain theoretical leg up as compared
with the nonprofit and public governance ones. And, if Benz
and Frey (2007) stated that the corporate governance may
"learn from Public Governance," this means otherwise that
the "lessons" are about the governance practices and not the
governance theories (p. 92). These practices constitute the
specificities of public governance. The same authors defend
the idea of the existence of some differences between corpo-
rate and public governance, in terms of "manager compensa-
tion, the division of power within firms, rules of succession in
top positions and institutionalized competition in core areas
of Governance." In addition, the board of directors can be
taken as a mechanism of governance to look for a certain con-
vergence between corporate and public governance. As
researchers have already explored the effectiveness of the
4 SAGE Open
board of directors of the for-profit organizations, the non-
profit domain seems to be fertile to lead an investigation
about the decision process within it. Thus, the nonprofit orga-
nizations in Europe adopt the dual system of management
and supervisory boards, unlike the prevalence of the Unitary
Board system in the for-profit organizations, leading to the
consideration of the case of the French public hospital, and
the possibility of the adoption of the dual system in the for-
profit as well as the nonprofit organizations.
The board's demography acts as the input in the input-
process-output Model emphasizing the relationship between
the characteristics of the incumbents of the board and the
performance and efficiency of the organization. This particu-
lar research adds another dimension by establishing the rela-
tionship between the board's demography and board's
process, as well as that between the board's process and
board's performance.
The Public Organization's Board Demography
Generally, matters relating to the board like that of the deter-
mination and change of tenure, the size, and the colleges of
the public board are always defined by the law. However, the
subject of the research on board governance analyzes the
demography of the board as follows.
The board size. As has been stated above, the law determines
the different components of the supervisory board. The size
of the board is determined according to the number and size
of colleges that compose the supervisory board of the French
public hospital. The three colleges are (a) at most five repre-
sentatives of the territorial authority, (b) at most five repre-
sentatives of the medical and nonmedical staff, and (c) at
most five qualified personalities, including two representa-
tives of the patients. As put by the law, the number of the
SUB members logically should not exceed 15. Prior to the
reforms, the number of the board of directors permitted by
the law was 30. All things held constant, the size of the SUB
can affect the extent of deliberation on the decision, as a
higher number of members in the SUB implies that it will be
more difficult to arrive at a consensus.Assuming that the size
of the Board is another side of the board composition, Zahra
and Pearce (1989) proposed to incorporate the board size
within the board composition. This Board size will not be
evoked, later during the course of this research, when the
French public hospital's SUB composition is described.
The board composition.Almost all academic researchers
have approximately a similar description of the board com-
position, an important part of the board's demography.
According to them, the duality outsiders/insiders distinguish
between individuals who operate the strategic Apex of the
organization (the insiders) and those who do not (the outsid-
ers; Huse, 2007). With regard to this distinction, the French
public hospital SUB is composed mostly by outsiders. This
is normally related to the nature of the SUB, unlike the
MGB, which is constituted completely by the insiders.
Therefore, compared with the proposed composition of the
board of directors, there is a quasi-separation between the
insiders and the outsiders. Thus, the question is about the
effect of this isolation on the decision-making process of the
outsiders (i.e., the SUB). Does this autonomy from the
insiders insure the requisite performance of roles by the
members of the SUB?
The board diversity.The third demography--the "board
diversity"--implies the presence of diverse skills and knowl-
edge within the Board (Forbes & Milliken, 1999). The
French public hospital SUB is composed of qualified person-
alities having competencies in several domains (law, finance,
management, and accounting). It has also added representa-
tives of patients with expert knowledge in social matters.
Then, there is the trade union with field-experience of the
actual work conditions. Again, the presence of physician's
representative within those trade unions manifests a posses-
sion of skills in terms of functioning of the hospital's internal
process. For instance, the public university hospital, a public
hospital, has the dean of the university as a member of the
SUB, who has full knowledge about the state of medical
research. Consequently, the presence of this diverse mosaic
of knowledge and skills is imperative for the apt performance
of roles of the French public hospital's SUB.
The three factors of board size, board composition, and
board diversity make up the demography of the public
organizations. As this research assumes the effect of
demography on the board process and the similar relation
between the board process and the board performance, it
becomes imperative to understand the board performance
through its roles.
The Public Organization's Board Roles
According to the literature review of Hinna, Nito, and
Mangia (2010) concerning the public organization board, the
members of the board have a few governing roles that vary
with the corporate governance theories (see Table 1).
Within the context of the French public hospital, several
roles are supposed to be played by the SUB. As this article
constitutes almost the first contribution after the reforms, the
research has been based on the French health care code for
the purpose of defining and describing the SUB tasks and
roles. Therefore, the only basis to answer the question about
the public and nonprofit organizations' boards--"What does
the Board do?"(Cornforth, 2006)--lies with the law.
However, as stated above, this source does not clearly clas-
sify the different roles of the SUB. Such clarification is sup-
posed necessary according to the board's behavior process,
to appreciate how the members of the SUB contribute to the
creation of value. In fact, the multitheory approach (Macus,
2008) explains the variety of roles as shown in Table 1.
Hirigoyen and Laouer 5
However, the common roles of the board cited in the theo-
retical researches (Forbes & Milliken, 1999; Huat & Tai Wai,
2001; Ong & David, 2008; Stiles & Taylor, 2001; Zahra &
Pearce, 1989) and the empirical researches (Kula, 2005; Wan
& Ong, 2005; Zona & Zattoni, 2007) are the strategy, ser-
vice, and control roles.
The strategy public board role. This part of the research estab-
lishes the scope of the strategic arena for the public boards.
In fact, the term strategy emanates from the extent of respon-
sibility of the MGB, across a wide array of analysis and deci-
sions from the financial documents like the "Projected State
of the Incomes and Expenses," Annual Activity Report, to
the planning, deliberating, and framing of the medical and
social projects. Therefore, the responsibility of the strategy
decision process has to be shared by both of the organs, the
MGB and the SUB, where the latter plays the role of discuss-
ing and analyzing the plans.
The service public board role. The SUB is required to offer its
consultation and opinion on documents like the quality
improvement policy, reception patients' condition, land pol-
icy, internal policies, and procedures prepared by the MGB.
Similarly, the board governance literature indicates that the
board service role includes the advice given by the board of
directors to the CEO (chief executive officer). In fact, Douma
(1997), the SUB, with an outsider's vision, is supposed to
have a lesser involvement in the running of the organization
as compared with the MGB, which is more concerned about
the day-to-day operations. This underlines the paramount
importance of assigning an autonomous service role to the
public board; wherein the SUB creates value by offering its
independent advice and consultancy.
The control public board role. As laid down by the law, while
realizing the board strategy role, the SUB controls the
actual execution of plans to be implemented by the MGB.
And, if necessary, the SUB's members can also nominate
an auditor to check whether the MGB is carrying on the
Hospital's strategy according to the terms stipulated by the
SUB. In fact, his task probably is the most important one.
The corporate governance theories intervention lets the
stakeholders of the hospital empowers the SUB to play the
role of the principal toward the MGB that is considered as
the agent, according to the agency theory (Fama & Jensen,
1983) and the stakeholder-agency theory (Hill & Jones,
1992).
As is evident, the literature on the relationship between
board demography or its characteristics and the board roles
of the public Board shows some ambiguity. This research
banks on recent works in corporate governance, relating to
the behavior of the board, arguing that the board process can
bring some ideas to the public board, therein redefining the
relationship between the board demography and the roles
performance.
The research further moves to the assessment of a possible
convergence between the corporate and public governance.
Are Some of the Corporate Governance Insights
Applicable in the Public Arena?
As has been shown, the French hospital SUB demography
and roles can be described similarly as is done in the private
sector. However, while the public services were considered
as an image of the bureaucratic regime, the emergence of the
new public governance is supposed to bring a new vision of
the public organization policy (Hood, 1991).

In fact, the agency theory with its roots in economic theo-
ries acted as the foundation of the disciplinary board gover-
nance approach. This was subsequently influenced by the
behavioral side of the board. The elites within the governing
board would eventually substitute performance with confor-
mance (Figure 2), under the aegis of value creation (Huse,
2007).
Hambrick, Werder, and Zajac (2008) dealt with "New
Directions in Corporate Governance Research" among oth-
ers with the behavioral process within the board of directors.
This matter constitutes a serious pathway of research to
counter the ambiguity about the relationship between board
characteristics and the organization's performance. In fact,
Eldenburg, Hermalin, Weisbach, and Wosinska (2004) found
a little evidence about this relationship within the nonprofit
hospital industry.
The board process issue is inspired from the group social
psychology approach and precisely the input-process-output
model (McGrath, 1964). In the particular research, the group
taken into consideration is the SUB. The inputs are its char-
acteristics (composition and diversity), while the output is
the performance of its roles, and the process is "the decision-
making related activities and styles of the board" (Zahra &
Pearce, 1989, p. 292).
Why does the decision-making process matter, given that
the public board members do not expect any material com-
pensation compared with their for-profit counterparts? The
answer to this question lies in the link between the Public
Hospital SUB's characteristics and its roles via certain
propositions.
In fact, to apprehend this board process clearly, Forbes
and Milliken (1999) classified it into three main parts,
namely (a) the use of skills and knowledge, (b) the cognitive
conflict, and (c) the effort norms.
The use of knowledge and skills.The public hospital's SUB
comprises of qualified personalities and other experts in sev-
eral domains such as medicine, medical research, social
affairs, political matters, and hospital management. These
experts, coming from varied backgrounds, apply their knowl-
edge and skills to the tasks of strategy, service, and control.
In fact, the medical and nonmedical staff representatives can
ratify the medical and social projects based on their social
and medical affairs' expertise. Other qualified personalities
can use their managerial competencies to approve the pro-
jected state of incomes and expenses. Moreover, the capital
of those skills and knowledge should be utilized to ensure the
fulfillment of the roles of control and service. The favorable
aspect is that the Law also allows the SUB members' experts
to criticize and give their opinions about the orientations of
the MGB. Thus,
Proposition 1: The research affirms that skills and knowl-
edge are present within the public hospital SUB and, if
used effectively, can perform the three roles of strategy,
service, and control.
The effort norms. Wageman (1995; as cited in Forbes & Mil-
liken, 1999) argued that "Effort norms are a group-level
construct that refer to the group's shared beliefs regarding
the level of effort everyone is expected to put towards a
task" (p. 493). These norms are shared expectations about
how the members of a group ought to behave (Levin &
Moreland, 1990). This element plays the role of the catalyst,
in the sense that the board should be accomplished by the
direction of the hospital and the members of the board them-
selves. This well-laid direction of the hospital should ensure
the best conditions before, during, and after the course meet-
ings. In reality, the effort norms can be manifested by the
preparations like sending the required documents to the
board members before the meetings, framing an effective
agenda, and training members in matters of governance.
From the point of view of the members, there should be a
certain level of vigilance on the preparation of elements to
be discussed, members should consecrate with ample time
assigned to do it and participate actively during the gather-
ings. By doing this, the SUB members and hospital's direc-
tions provide a favorable environment to ensure that the
meetings go on smoothly. Then,
Proposition 2: Enhancing effort norms by the SUB and
the Hospital direction provide favorable conditions to
perform the service, strategy, and control roles.

The cognitive conflict.According to Forbes and Milliken
(1999) the cognitive conflict "refers to task-oriented differ-
ences in judgment among group members" (p. 494). In fact,
the diversity that characterizes the public hospital SUB may
open a dialog between ideas about the eventual strategic ori-
entations. As experts discuss and debate conflicting ideas,
the alternatives discussed among the different representa-
tives are insured within a kind of "positive" interaction.
Therefore, "the brewing" of ideas enhances the debate about
critical issues. In a way, the SUB members prove a capability
to review all management orientations with some hindsight.
They can advise, monitor, and ratify decisions of the MGB,
based on their dynamism. Given that they are supposed to be
acting separately from the Hospital's managers, this avoids
the rubber stamp role of MGB's management decisions.
Accordingly,
Proposition 3: The presence of cognitive conflict within
the French hospital SUB performs its strategy, service,
and control roles.
Conclusion
The corporatization of the French public hospital:  Gortner et al.
(2007) drew a line while linking the private and public orga-
nizations (positioning in the extremities) via the nonprofit
organizations. This conception seems to underline a state of
organization metamorphosis.
Researchers, from various administrative and manage-
rial approaches, usually differentiate between the processes
of privatization and publicization (Heilman & Watson,
1993) and try to argue which of them may be more efficient
for the organization. Then, the governance approach takes
over and opens the pathway to study the nonprofit (includ-
ing public) and for-profit sectors in the light of the gover-
nance board theory. This research shows how public
governance may be an application of the corporate gover-
nance through the board process approach. Generally, under
the conditions of autonomy of the SUB, there will be a con-
crete expression of the corporatization of the French public
hospital. In addition, the study reveals that the MGB and
SUB include reputed physicians, a fact that seems to create
an ambiguity: Some of them make a decision (within the
MGB) and the others who ratify (within the SUB; Laouer,
2011).
Future Research Possibility
The incidence of corporatization when analyzed under the
perspective of the board process, within the French hospital
industry can also be applied to the public universities in the
same country, which are also in the process of privatization.
Like the public hospitals, the governance of the universities
in France faces the same choices in corporatization or publi-

the board of directors with varied stakes and opinions, mak-
ing the board process an integral part in decision making,
strategic as well as regular.
