Background. Breast cancer care, such as utilization of screening procedures and types of treatment received, varies
substantially by geographic region of the United States. However, little is known about variations in survival with breast
cancer.
Methods. We examined breast cancer incidence, survival, and mortality in the 66 health service areas covered by the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for women aged 65 and older at diagnosis. Incidence and
survival data were derived from SEER, while breast cancer mortality data were from Vital Statistics data.
Results. There was considerable variation in breast cancer survival among the 66 health service areas (2  202.7,
p  .0001). There was also significant variation in incidence and mortality from breast cancer. In a partial correlation
weighted for the size of the health service area, both incidence (r  .812) and percent 5-year survival (r  .587) cor-
relate with mortality. In a Poisson regression analysis, the combination of variation in incidence and variation in survival
explains 90.9% of the variation in mortality.
Conclusions. There is considerable geographic variation in survival from breast cancer among older women, and
this contributes to variation in breast cancer mortality. Geographic variations in breast cancer mortality should diminish
as the quality of breast cancer care becomes more standardized.
ARIATIONS in the rate of diseases across different
populations and geographic areas provide powerful
clues in studies of disease etiology. For example, Doll and
Peto relied primarily on such information to conclude that
the great majority of cancers were environmentally deter-
mined, for example, tobacco, diet, pollutants, and others (1).
Much of the information on geographic variation in cancer
rates comes from Vital Statistics mortality data, which are
used as a proxy indicator of disease incidence. However,
mortality rate from any disease is a function of both the in-
cidence rate and the survival rate of persons with the dis-
ease. Diseases with high mortality and short survival exhibit
a very close relationship between incidence rate and mortal-
ity rate (2­4). In contrast, in diseases with a substantial
chance for cure, factors that affect survival, such as early di-
agnosis and treatment, should have an important effect on
mortality rates.
There are well-described, stable geographic variations in
mortality rates from breast cancer in the United States.
These exist at a regional level (e.g., Northwest vs South)
and also at the level of small areas (e.g., census tracts within
a state) (5­10). The geographic differences have stimulated
considerable research about their cause, such as regional
differences in diet or differences in proximity to high-volt-
age electric lines. One factor common to these investiga-
tions is the assumption that variation in mortality from
breast cancer reflects variation in incidence of breast cancer.
We have previously argued that regional variations in breast
cancer mortality may reflect differences in survival as well
as differences in incidence (6). In this report, we test that
hypothesis by examining the variations in incidence, sur-
vival, and mortality from breast cancer among different
health service areas (HSAs). HSAs are aggregations of
counties based on a cluster analysis of where Medicare pa-
tients obtained routine hospital care in 1988 (11). They are a
good tool to examine variations in medical practice and out-
comes across small areas (12). We assess the relation of any
variation in incidence and survival to the variation in breast
cancer mortality. We use data from the Surveillance, Epide-
miology, and End Results (SEER) program to assess inci-
dence and survival, and Vital Statistics data to determine
breast cancer mortality rates.
METHODS
Subjects
Eligible women for our study include those who were age
65 and older in 1985­1991 residing in one of the nine SEER
areas. Our specific cohort of breast cancer subjects consists
of women identified with incident breast cancer in 1985­
1991.

Sources of Data
SEER tumor registry.--The National Cancer Institute's
SEER program supports population-based tumor registries
in selected geographic areas. In 1985, these areas included
the metropolitan areas of San Francisco/Oakland, Detroit,
Atlanta, and Seattle, and the states of Connecticut, Iowa,
New Mexico, Utah, and Hawaii (13). These areas cover ap-
proximately 14% of the U.S. population. SEER's own qual-
ity assurance checks report a high degree of completeness of
determining incident cancers. SEER incidence rates are
used to project to the total U.S. population to estimate the
national incidence rates for various cancers.
The SEER Public Use File is the source of data for esti-
mating incidence and survival rates. For all incident breast
cancer cases, the file includes month and year of diagnosis,
county of residence, and period of follow-up. If the subject
has died, the file also contains the date of death and cause of
death as coded on the state death certificate with ICD-9
codes.
National Center for Health Statistics mortality data
files.--Mortality data from the National Center for Health
Statistics (1985­1991) were used to construct breast cancer
mortality rates at the county level. Each record in these files
represents one death and includes data elements on the de-
cedent's age, gender, county of residence, and underlying
cause of death. The source of these data is information re-
corded on death certificates filed for deaths in each of the 50
states. In our analyses of the mortality data, the death is al-
located to the county of the decedent's residence, not where
death occurred.
Health Service Area
Our study uses the HSA definitions that are used in the
Atlas of United States Mortality to illustrate geographic dif-
ferences in death rates for selected causes of death (12).
These HSAs are based on those identified by the National
Center for Health Statistics to define one or more counties
that are "relatively self-contained with respect to the provi-
sion of routine hospital care" (11). HSAs were formed by
applying a clustering algorithm on travel patterns of patients
for their hospital care. The objective was to form areas
where residents in these areas were more likely to use rou-
tine hospital services in the area than outside it. The SEER
Public Use File contains population, incidence, and survival
information at the county level. These counties were aggre-
gated into HSAs using a file that maps U.S. counties by
Federal Information Processing Standards codes (a two-
digit state number followed by a three-digit county number)
to its corresponding HSA. This file is included in the Atlas
of United States Mortality CD-ROM.

service areas covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are shown by
horizontal lines. Incidence was calculated from SEER data; mortality was calculated from Vital Statistics data; and survival was calculated as
percent breast cancer-specific 5-year survival generated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves from SEER data. For incidence and survival, we used
incident breast cancer cases in 1985 through 1991. For mortality, we used Vital Statistics data from 1985 through 1991.
VARIATION IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVAL M403
The SEER areas analyzed in this study contained 72 of
the 805 HSAs. Smaller HSAs were aggregated within SEER
area to yield clusters with a minimum of five expected
breast cancer deaths in 1985­1991, forming a total of 66
HSAs. The aggregated HSAs were 704 and 814 (New Mex-
ico); 711, 755, and 799 (Utah); and 544, 552, 626, and 665
(Iowa).
Incidence, Mortality, and Survival Rates
Incidence rates by HSA were calculated for each age
group using the number of incident cases and population es-
timates provided by the SEER program. Likewise, age-spe-
cific breast cancer mortality rates were generated from esti-
mates of the number of breast cancer deaths using the
mortality data files and the SEER population estimates. In-
formation on the date of death, underlying cause of death,
and period of follow-up in the SEER database allows us to
generate 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival rates for each HSA.
Events were comprised of breast cancer-specific deaths
(ICD-9 174xx). Deaths from all other causes were censored.
These 5-year survival rates were generated for each year
from 1985­1991 and then averaged over these 7 years for
analysis.
Analysis
Breast cancer survival among the HSAs was initially ex-
amined with Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and their homo-
geneity was assessed with the log rank test. Geographic
variations in incidence and mortality were modeled using
Poisson regression with HSA as an independent variable.
The relationships between incidence and mortality and be-
tween survival and mortality were examined with bubble
plots, Pearson correlation coefficients, partial correlation
coefficients, and Poisson regression models. The correlation
estimates were based on weighted least squares because the
HSAs (the unit of observation) differ greatly in size. Treat-
ing each HSA with equal weight resulted in correlation co-
efficients being driven by HSAs with a small number of
breast cancer cases. The statistical tests of significance and
associated p values were derived from Poisson regression
because the assumptions are more suitable for estimating vi-
tal rates. All computations and data management were done
using the SAS version 6.12 statistical application (SAS In-
stitute, Cary, NC) (14).
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the distribution of incidence, mortality,
and percent 5-year survival from breast cancer among the
66 HSAs in the nine SEER areas. There is considerable
variation in all three measurements. There are a number of
ways to demonstrate that this variation is not simply ran-
dom. For example, when the incidence and mortality rates
were modeled using Poisson regression, HSA was a signifi-
cant predictor (p  .0001) for both models. Kaplan-Meier
survival curves indicated significantly different survival
times across the HSAs (2  202.7, p  .0001).
Figure 2 shows the relationship between incidence of
breast cancer and breast cancer mortality for each of the 66
HSAs. In this figure, the size of the bubble is proportional to
the total number of women age 65 or older in each HSA. As
expected, there is a clear correlation between incidence and
mortality, with a weighted correlation coefficient r  .733
(p  .0001).

the number of women aged 65 residing in the HSA. The correlation (by weighted least squares) of incidence to mortality was .733. Larger

HSAs. They are significantly correlated with a weighted
correlation coefficient r  .335 (p  .0001).
Table 1 presents weighted partial correlations of both in-
cidence and survival with breast cancer mortality. Both inci-
dence and survival (adjusted for each other) are correlated
with mortality. Because the over-65 age group is heteroge-
neous, we also repeated the weighted Pearson and partial
correlation coefficients after stratifying the population into
those 65 to 74 and those 75 and older. As shown in Table 1,
incidence and survival are highly correlated with mortality
in both age groups.
The weighted least square analysis employed in Table 1
did not allow for a test of statistical significance of the vari-
ation in breast cancer mortality attributable to the two vari-
ables, incidence and survival. To further investigate this re-
lationship, we estimated Poisson regression models for the
combined group and the two age strata (Table 2). The R2
(generalized coefficient of determination) (15) for the model
including both incidence and survival is .909, indicating
that the combination of incidence and survival from breast
cancer explains approximately 91% of the total variation in
breast cancer mortality among the 66 HSAs. These associa-
tions are all statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study can be summarized as follows.
There is considerable variation among the 66 health service
areas within SEER tumor registries in breast cancer mortal-
ity rates, as assessed by Vital Statistics data, and in incidence

ogy, and End Results [SEER] data) for each of the 66 health service areas (HSAs) within the areas covered by SEER. The correlation (by
weighted least squares) of survival to mortality was .335. Larger HSAs had more influence on this correlation than did smaller ones.

*The simple and partial correlation coefficients are derived from weighted
least squares regression. A positive simple correlation coefficient between inci-
dence and mortality indicates that as the incidence increases, so does the mortal-
ity, with more populous HSAs having greater influence on the coefficient of cor-
relation than smaller ones. Conversely, the negative coefficient values between
survival and mortality indicate an increase in survival corresponded with a de-
crease in mortality. The weighted partial correlation coefficients have a similar
interpretation, except that the relationship with mortality adjusts for the effects
of the other variable (either incidence or survival). Here again, the larger HSAs
have a greater impact on the simple and partial correlation coefficients.

of and survival from breast cancer, as assessed by SEER
data. In a partial correlation, both variation in 5-year breast
cancer-specific survival as well as variation in breast cancer
incidence are highly correlated with breast cancer mortality
among the 66 health service areas. Together, variation in in-
cidence and survival explained 90% of the variation in
breast cancer mortality.
Why might there be variation in survival after a diagnosis
of breast cancer among different HSAs? Survival is affected
by tumor biology, stage at diagnosis, and choice of treat-
ment. Tumor characteristics, such as histologic grade, vary
somewhat among different races. Thus, differences in sur-
vival among HSAs could be explained in part by the relative
racial composition of the HSAs. Use of screening mammog-
raphy, a major determinant of early diagnosis, has been
shown to vary by region (8,16). In addition, several investi-
gators have shown large geographic variations in the quality
of treatment received for breast cancer, particularly among
older women (17­21). Substantial proportions of older
women with breast cancer are receiving breast-conserving
surgery without axillary dissection or adjuvant irradiation
(17­27). Such treatment is associated with a two-fold higher
mortality rate in population-based studies, and it is not rec-
ommended by any authority or expert panel (23,25).
Perhaps the best-known example of differences in sur-
vival rates driving differences in mortality rates in breast
cancer is in black-white differences; age-adjusted mortality
rates from breast cancer are approximately 20% higher
among African American women compared with non-His-
panic whites, while the incidence rates for blacks are ap-
proximately 12% lower (2,28). Had only the mortality rates
been examined, it might have been erroneously concluded
that breast cancer incidence is greater in black than in white
women, but in reality the higher mortality rates are entirely
secondary to the poorer survival experience of African
American women with breast cancer (29).
There are a number of limitations to this study. First, the
analyses were all ecological, at the level of the HSA and not
at the level of the individual. Second, the associations
among breast cancer incidence or survival on the one hand
and breast cancer mortality on the other do not prove a
causal relationship. Third, the findings were obtained in
data from women aged 65 and older and may not reflect the
pattern found in younger women.
Most studies of geographic differences in breast cancer
mortality have assumed that such differences reflect differ-
ences in the incidence of breast cancer in different areas
(5,7,9,10). These findings have in turn stimulated consider-
able research into the possible causes of such differences in
breast cancer incidence (9,30­32). Our results confirm that
mortality differences do indeed reflect differences in inci-
dence, but they also show that an additional contributor to
differences in mortality from breast cancer are geographic
differences in survival. If the large geographic differences
in breast cancer mortality are considered entirely secondary
to differences in incidence of breast cancer, then there are
no obvious steps to reduce those differences; that is, there
are no generally accepted measures to reduce breast cancer
incidence. On the other hand, the recognition that survival
plays a role in geographic differences in breast cancer mor-
tality would suggest that cancer control efforts directed to
standardize the quality of breast cancer care would also di-
minish the geographic variations in breast cancer mortality.
