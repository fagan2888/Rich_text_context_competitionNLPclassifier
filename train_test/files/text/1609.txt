Study objectives: This study examines the influence of individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic
status (SES) on mortality among black, Mexican-American, and white women and men in the US. The
authors had three study objectives. Firstly, they examined mortality rates by both individual level SES
(measured by income, education, and occupational/employment status) and neighbourhood level SES
(index of neighbourhood income/wealth, educational attainment, occupational status, and
employment status). Secondly, they examined whether neighbourhood SES was associated with mor-
tality after controlling for individual SES. Thirdly, they calculated the population attributable risk to esti-
mate the reduction in mortality rates if all women and men lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods.
Design: National Health Interview Survey (1987­1994), linked with 1990 census tract
(neighbourhood proxy) and mortality data through 1997.
Setting/participants: Nationally representative sample of 59 935 black, 19 201 Mexican-American,
and 344 432 white men and women (six gender and racial/ethnic groups), aged 25­64 at interview.
Main results: Mortality rates for all six gender and racial/ethnic groups were two to four times higher
for those with the lowest incomes (lowest quartile) who lived in the lowest SES neighbourhoods (lowest
tertile) compared with those with the highest incomes who lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods. For
the six groups, the age adjusted mortality risk associated with living in the lowest SES neighbourhoods
ranged from 1.43 to 1.61. The mortality risk decreased but remained significant (p values <.05) after
adjusting for each of the three individual measures of SES, with the exception of Mexican-American
women. Furthermore, the mortality risk associated with living in the lowest SES neighbourhoods
remained significant after simultaneously adjusting for all three individual measures of SES for white
men (p<0.001) and white women (p<0.05). Deaths would hypothetically be reduced by about 20%
for each subgroup if everyone had the same death rates as those living in the highest SES neighbour-
hoods (highest tertile).
Conclusions: Living in a low SES neighbourhood confers additional mortality risk beyond individual
SES.
The importance of neighbourhoods in our life cycles has
long been observed. Over 30 years ago Rossi noted that our
neighbourhoods provide the medical facilities in which
we are born, the schools in which we are taught, the housing
in which we live, the social milieu in which we set up our
households, the factories and businesses where we find work,
and finally the cemeteries where we are buried.1 While factors
beyond our neighbourhoods also affect our lives, the local
community plays an important part in shaping our daily
experiences and is the setting in which many social, economic,
and political policies have an impact.2
It is logical that the neighbourhood socioeconomic environ-
ment plays an important part in our health. This may occur, in
part, via access to goods and services (for example, education
and employment opportunities; price, availability, and quality
of goods and services), norms and values, and the physical
environment (for example, air and water quality). Despite the
fact that neighbourhoods, as well as people, are stratified
along socioeconomic lines, surprisingly few studies have
focused on the role of the neighbourhood environment in
shaping the health of its residents. Studies have more
commonly focused on how individual socioeconomic charac-
teristics influence health.3­8 However, there is a growing
consensus that socioeconomic characteristics of neighbour-
hoods may influence both the socioeconomic status (SES) and
health of its residents.
Findings from historical and contemporary epidemiological
studies that have examined individual SES and mortality have
consistently shown that women and men with low SES,
regardless of how it is measured, have higher death rates than
their higher SES counterparts.8­11 Recent studies have exam-
ined neighbourhood SES and mortality, focusing on the
broader social context within which health related behav-
iours, decisions, and events occur. Findings from these studies
indicate that neighbourhood SES is associated with individual
level mortality, independent of individual SES.9 12­21 This
suggests that characteristics of places represent more than the
aggregation of characteristics of their residents. The magni-
tude of the neighbourhood effects in these studies has gener-
ally been modest. However, it is difficult to determine the
extent to which individual level SES is on the pathway
between neighbourhood SES and mortality (that is, is a
mediator rather than a confounder) so that the effect of
neighbourhood SES on mortality could be underestimated
after adjusting for individual SES.
This study extends the existing literature on neighbourhood
SES and individual level mortality, while considering the
effects of individual SES. We used a nationally representative
sample that includes the three largest racial/ethnic groups of

women and men in the US. We stratified by racial/ethnic
group because we hypothesised that neighbourhood effects
could potentially vary across groups given that patterns of
residential segregation are closely related to socioeconomic
segregation. We had three study objectives. Firstly, we
examined mortality rates by both individual level SES
(measured by income, education, and occupational/
employment status) and neighbourhood level SES (index of
neighbourhood income/wealth, educational attainment, occu-
pational status, and employment status). Secondly, we exam-
ined whether neighbourhood SES was associated with
mortality after controlling for individual SES. Thirdly, we cal-
culated the population attributable risk to estimate the reduc-
tion in mortality rates (that is, number of lives saved) if all
women and men lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods.
METHODS
Data sources
We used data from the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) from 1987­1994. We linked these data to the 1990 US.
Census for neighbourhood SES and to the National Health
Interview Survey/Multiple Cause of Death Public Use Data file
(NHIS/NDI) for mortality through 1997. We included data for
black, Mexican-American, and white women and men, aged
25­64 at interview. This age group was selected to ensure that
most people had completed their education and because pre-
vious research has found that SES differences in health are
greater for young and middle aged adults compared with the
elderly population.10 22 23 The NHIS data were collected through
a continuing survey of US households in a multistage design
where a probability sample of the civilian population is drawn
each week.24 25
The NHIS/NDI file was produced by the National Center for
Health Statistics by matching characteristics from the NHIS
and the National Death Index (NDI), allowing for a follow up
mortality link with survey data.26 The NDI was searched from
the month and year of the NHIS interview to 31 December
1997, making the shortest follow up period one month and the
longest follow up period 11 years. The final sample consisted
of 59 935 black, 19 201 Mexican-American, and 344 432 white
women and men (table 1).
Addresses of the respondents in each annual NHIS file have
been geocoded to 1990 census geography, which was used to
link characteristics of the respondents' place of residence
using census tract level data. Census tracts include about 4000
to 7000 people, have boundaries that represent comparatively
homogeneous populations in terms of social and economic
characteristics,27 28 and have been used extensively as proxy
measures of neighbourhood environments. Only 5.4% of
respondents were missing geographical identifiers and were
not included in the analysis.
All research was approved by the appropriate ethics
committee at Stanford University, School of Medicine and
conforms to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Definition of variables
Individual level SES was defined by three measures:
educational attainment, income-to-needs ratio (annual in-
come per family member), and a combined measure of occu-
pational and employment status. We operationalised edu-
cational attainment into categories based on achieved
credentials (less than 9 years, 9­11 years, 12 years, more than
12 years). The income-to-needs ratio was calculated by divid-
ing the midpoint of the categories for family income by family
size as the resources available to a family size of one with
$50 000 are very different than to a larger family size with the
same income. The midpoint of family incomes above $50 000
(the highest cut off in the NHIS) was assigned a value of
$75 000 (which was just below the average family income of
$79 000 for families making over $50 000 according to the
1990 US census).29 We operationalised income into gender and
racial/ethnic group specific empirical quartiles because previ-
ous research on the effects of income on health outcomes has
shown non-linear effects30 and because categorising income
allowed us to include an indicator variable for those with
missing income data (see appendix). We operationalised
occupational/employment status into four standard census
based categories: not in the labour force (including retired
persons, homemakers, students), unemployed, blue collar
workers (service, farming/forestry/fishing, precision
production/craft/repair, and operator/fabricator/laborer occu-
pations), and white collar workers (managerial/professional
specialty, and technical/sales/administrative support occupa-
tions). We excluded persons in the military and those with
unknown occupations. Correlations among the three indi-
vidual SES measures were 0.48 or below for the overall sample
and for each racial/ethnic group.
To define neighbourhood level SES, we performed a princi-
pal components analysis using standardised values of five
census tract variables to represent neighbourhood level
educational attainment (percentage of persons 25 years and
over without a high school degree), income (median family
income), wealth (median housing value), occupational status
(percentage blue collar workers), and employment status
(percentage unemployed). The first component accounted for
almost 60% of the variance. All five variables contributed
about equally to the component; therefore, we calculated our
neighbourhood SES index as the mean of the standardised
values with equal weights. We compared the neighbourhood
SES index to one based on centile ranks to examine whether
outliers influenced the index and found that the two indices
were highly correlated (0.96); therefore, we used the index
based on the means of the standardised values in our analyses.
We operationalised the neighbourhood SES index into gender
specific and racial/ethnic group specific empirical tertiles (see
appendix). Previous analyses have found this sample of
census tracts to be nationally representative of all US census
tracts in terms of socioeconomic characteristics.31
Race/ethnicity was self reported and included persons who
identified themselves as either black (non-Hispanic),
Mexican-American (Mexican-Mexicano, Mexican-American,
Chicano), or white (non-Hispanic). Other racial/ethnic groups
were excluded from the analysis because of small sample
sizes.
Analytical approach
We calculated age adjusted, all cause mortality rates per
100 000 person years for the follow up period by dividing the
number of deaths by the number of person years of follow up.
Mortality rates are presented for women and men for the three
racial/ethnic groups, stratified by individual and neighbour-
hood SES. Relative rates of mortality were obtained using Cox

proportional hazards regression models. The final models
were estimated with the summary neighbourhood SES index
as well as with each component of the index and similar pat-
terns were found. The population attributable risk (PAR) was
calculated using the overall death rates compared with the
rates for those living in the highest SES neighbourhoods,
without regard to individual SES. Thus, the PAR represents the
proportional reduction in mortality that would occur if every-
one experienced the mortality rates of those living in the
highest SES neighbourhoods.
As the NHIS is a complex multistage probability sample
that yields clustered observations, we used SUDAAN (version
7.5.6, Research Triangle Institute, 2000) to account for the
survey design effects and to produce valid variance estimates
in our regression models.32 SUDAAN also alleviates difficulties
with statistical inference introduced by multilevel research
designs.33 34 Multilevel linear modelling techniques35 36 were
not used in this analysis because, while the number of census
tracts (or neighbourhoods) was large for each group, there
were few adults sampled per tract (about two persons sampled
per tract).37 Given that our data, in large measure, are not
nested (that is, few sampled per tract) and that one person's
mortality is not likely to affect another person's in the same
tract (that is, low intercorrelation coefficient), we feel that this
analytical approach is appropriate. Previous studies have used
a similar analytical approach.12 14 15 33 38­41
RESULTS
Black and Mexican-American women and men lived in lower
SES neighbourhoods compared with white women and men,
as measured by our neighbourhood SES index. As illustrated
in figure 1, there was little overlap in the middle tertile of the
SES index when comparing the white population with black
population and Mexican-Americans. The values within each
tertile represent very different neighbourhood conditions. For
example, neighbourhoods with a SES index value of 1 (the
approximate upper value for the middle tertile of neighbour-
hood SES for the black population and Mexican-Americans)
compared with 0 (the approximate upper value for the middle
tertile of neighbourhood SES for the white population) had
40% more blue collar workers (60% v 43%), twice the
proportion of residents without a high school degree (44% v
21%), two thirds the median family income value ($21 000 v
$33 000), 40% lower housing values ($48 000 v 68,000), and
50% higher unemployment rates (6.1% v 4.1%). Because of
these differences we stratified the analyses by race/ethnicity so
that the results can be interpreted within each racial/ethnic
group.
The age adjusted mortality rates per 100 000 person years
by individual SES (in this case, income to needs ratio) and the
neighbourhood SES index are shown in figure 2. For all com-
parisons, there was a more pronounced gradient between
individual SES and mortality than for neighbourhood SES
and mortality. Overall, mortality rates were higher for men
than for women (note the different scales for the mortality
rates), and were highest for black men and women. Death
rates generally increased as neighbourhood SES decreased,
with the exception of Mexican American men and women for
whom the patterns were less consistent. One noticeable
exception was that the highest death rates for Mexican-
American women and men were for those with the lowest
family incomes who lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods.
Death rates for all six gender and racial/ethnic groups were
two to four times higher for those with the lowest incomes
(lowest quartile) who lived in the lowest SES neighbourhoods
(lowest tertile) compared with those with the highest incomes
who lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods. The relations
between educational attainment and occupational/
employment status with neighbourhood SES were less
consistent (data not shown). This is possibly because of
smaller sample sizes within certain categories (for example,
number of unemployed).
To examine whether living in a low SES neighbourhood
conferred additional mortality risk beyond individual SES, we
calculated relative mortality ratios from age adjusted Cox pro-
portional hazards models (tables 2 and 3). We estimated five
models for each of the six groups. The independent variables
were: age and neighbourhood SES (model 1); age, one of the
individual SES variables (income to needs, educational
attainment, or occupation/employment status) and neigh-
bourhood SES (models 2­4); and age, all three individual SES
variables, and neighbourhood SES (model 5). For the six
groups, the age adjusted mortality risk associated with living
in the lowest SES neighbourhoods ranged from 1.43 to 1.61 (a
43% to 61% increased risk) (model 1). The mortality risk
decreased but remained significant (p values <0.05) after
adjusting for each of the three individual measures of SES,
with the exception of Mexican-American women (models
2­4). As an example, for white women, the 43% increased risk
in mortality associated with living in a low SES neighbour-
hood decreased to 18% when adjusting for the income to
needs ratio, to 22% when adjusting for educational attain-
ment, and to 36% when adjusting for occupation/employment
status. In model 5, living in a low SES neighbourhood was
associated with an 11%­18% increase in the risk of mortality
for white women and men respectively, which remained
statistically significant after simultaneously adjusting for all
three measures of individual SES (p values <0.05 and
<0.001).
Table 4 presents the PAR as a percentage and in absolute
terms. As a percentage, not controlling for individual SES,
deaths would hypothetically be reduced by about 20% for each
of the six groups if everyone had the same death rates as those
living in the highest SES neighbourhoods (highest tertile spe-
cific to each racial/ethnic and gender group). In absolute
terms, black men and women would benefit the most; their
rates would be reduced by 201.2 deaths per 100 000 person
years for black men and 143.1 deaths per 100 000 person years
for black women.
DISCUSSION
This study compares the pattern and effect size of neighbour-
hood SES on mortality for black, Mexican-American, and
white women and men across different measures and levels of
individual SES. Consistent with past research, we found that
the effects of individual SES were stronger than the effects of
neighbourhood SES.21 In addition, neighbourhood SES ex-
erted independent effects beyond individual SES. Except for

Mexican-American women, residence in a low SES neigh-
bourhood was associated with a significantly increased risk of
mortality for all groups, after adjusting for each of the three
individual measures of SES (and remained significant for
white women and men after simultaneously adjusting for all
three measures). We estimated that deaths would be reduced
by about 20% for each group if everyone had the same death
rates as those living in the highest SES neighbourhoods. The
absolute number of deaths saved would be substantial for all
ethnic and gender groups, and especially for black women and
men.
Several previous studies have examined neighbourhood
effects on the risk of mortality. However, none have used a
nationally representative sample of black, Mexican-American,
and white women and men with both individual and
neighbourhood measures of SES, and presented results
separately by gender and race/ethnicity. Anderson et al,17 used
the National Longitudinal Mortality Study to compare 11 year
mortality risk for black and white women and men, ages
25­64, living in low income census tracts versus high income
census tracts, after adjusting for individual family income.
They found similar relative risks as our current study for black
and white women and men, but did not examine socioeco-
nomic inequalities among Mexican-Americans. Waitzman and
Smith used the NHANES I with the Epidemiologic Follow-up
Survey to examine poverty area residence and mortality.18 They
found that poverty area residence was associated with
increased follow up mortality among young and middle aged
women and men, after adjusting for individual characteristics;
they did not examine black and white adults in separate analy-
ses. LeClere et al14 used the same dataset as our study (but ana-
lysed the three racial/ethnic groups together and used a shorter
follow up time) to examine the role of racial/ethnic segregation
in explaining racial/ethnic disparities in mortality. They found
that neighbourhood segregation explained racial/ethnic dis-
parities in mortality. Another population based mortality
follow up study in the Netherlands examined mortality and
found significant socioeconomic neighbourhood effects; how-
ever, their measures of neighbourhood were derived from
aggregated individual level reports and not from all neighbour-
hood residents.42 Finally, two studies using prospective data
from a survey in one county in California (the Alameda County
Study) found independent neighbourhood effects on the risk
of mortality.9 13 When combined with the results of these previ-
ous studies, our findings provide further evidence that the
neighbourhood socioeconomic environment is "independ-
ently" associated with risk of mortality.
Our results for Mexican-American women and men
differed from the other racial/ethnic and gender groups in two
regards. Firstly, for Mexican-American men there was only
one significant association between individual level SES and
mortality (the increased hazard for men not in the labour
force compared with white collar men). Secondly, for
Mexican-American women, the associations between indi-
vidual level SES and mortality were generally significant;
however, the association between neighbourhood SES and
mortality became non-significant after adjustment for any of
the individual measures of SES. These findings differ from

Socioeconomic status and mortality 449

those for black and white women and men, where we found
graded inverse associations between both individual and
neighbourhood level SES and mortality. While the reasons for
these patterns among Mexican-American women and men
are unclear, we suggest that perhaps the harmful effects of low
individual SES for men and low neighbourhood SES for
women may be buffered by protective factors, such as social
processes (for example, cohesion, social support, social
control) or cultural factors (for example, acculturation, strong
ties to Mexico) that may be more prevalent among Mexican-
Americans compared with the other groups, but may operate
differently for Mexican-American women and men.38 43
Strengths and limitations
There are a number of strengths to our analyses. To examine
socioeconomic inequalities in mortality, we used data from a
nationally representative sample with multiple measures of
SES. This increases the generalisability and validity of our
findings.2 44 In addition, the census tracts used in our analyses
(that is, those in which the study sample resided) have been
shown to be nationally representative of all US census tracts in
terms of socioeconomic characteristics.31
The limitations of our work include possible bias from sev-
eral sources. Firstly, neighbourhood SES levels were measured
in 1990 whereas surveys were conducted from 1987 to 1994.
This presents the possibility of simultaneity bias because in
some cases neighbourhood poverty was measured after
persons surveyed had died; however, we do not expect this to
be an important bias because socioeconomic characteristics of
neighbourhoods generally do not change significantly over a
several year period.45 Secondly, income had considerable miss-
ing data; 20% for the black population, 15% for Mexican-
Americans, and 14% for the white population. For all three
groups of women and men, those with missing income data
were less likely to be white collar workers, and were more
likely to have lower educational attainment and be older
(except Mexican-American men), out of the labour force, and
living in a low SES neighbourhood (except for Mexican-
Americans) compared with those without missing income. All
people with missing income were retained in the analysis in
separate categories. Thirdly, there is possible bias in the prob-
ability of being classified as dead because the linkage between
the NHIS and NDI relies on a matching methodology. We
examined this possible bias between the matching method-
ology and age, gender, race/ethnicity, individual and neigh-
bourhood SES, and found no evidence for substantial bias in
the probability of being classified as dead.
A further possible limitation is that factors associated with
self selection into certain neighbourhoods could account for
the results, leading to erroneous conclusions of neighbour-
hood effects. Neighbourhoods are based on geographically
defined census tract boundaries and considerable debate
exists as to whether these boundaries represent neighbour-
hoods as defined by the residents living within them.
Moreover, geographical boundaries may not be the most
appropriate way to define neighbourhoods; for example,
others have suggested that neighbourhood definitions should
be based on patterns of social interaction.46 Finally, we have no
information regarding the historical context of neighbour-
hoods, how they are changing, or how long people have been
exposed to their neighbourhood environments.46
Our finding that neighbourhood SES was not statistically
significant after adjusting for the three measures of individual
SES for some groups does not necessarily mean that
neighbourhood SES does not matter; indeed, individual SES is
partly determined by the residential environment in which
one lives and thus can be a mediator. This has led to consider-
able debate over whether individual SES in models examining
neighbourhood effects is a true confounder or a mediator (for
a detailed discussion of this issue, see Diez-Roux 199847 and
Diez-Roux 200141). If a person's neighbourhood SES partly
determines their individual SES (for example, through
educational and/or employment opportunities), then indi-
vidual SES would be considered a mediator in the causal
pathway between neighbourhood SES and mortality as com-
pared with a true confounder. If this is the case, our models
unadjusted for individual SES (see tables 2 and 3, model 1)
may be more appropriate to estimate the effect of neighbour-
hood SES on mortality. In addition, our models adjusted for
individual SES (see tables 2 and 3, models 2­5) may underes-
timate the effect of neighbourhood SES on mortality.13 47 It is
perhaps more appropriate to consider the "neighbourhood
effect" as a range with the age adjusted estimate as the upper
bound (model 1) and the age and individual SES adjusted
estimates as the lower bound (model 5).48
The influence of neighbourhoods
Our findings show that, in general, living in a low SES neigh-
bourhood is associated with increased risk of mortality,
regardless of a person's individual SES. This may be because
neighbourhoods become highly differentiated over time in the
availability of goods and services as residents move according
to their demands for such goods and services. In addition to
the historical context of neighbourhoods, these demands may
produce varied local environments based upon ability to pay,
resulting in affluent places characterised by less hazardous
physical environments and greater access to high quality
goods and services (both publicly and privately provided)
compared with less affluent places.46 Furthermore, norms and
values may become differentiated according to the SES of a
neighbourhood through peer influences and collective sociali-
sation, and may, for instance, influence health related behav-
iours of its residents.49 Finally, neighbourhood SES may influ-
ence the risk of mortality through psychosocial mechanisms,
such as social support or sense of control.

Implications for public policy
Over 31 million white, almost 4.5 million black, and over 1.5
million Mexican-American women and men live in low SES
neighbourhoods (the lowest tertile of our neighbourhood SES
index). Knowledge about the neighbourhoods in which people
live can provide health professionals with valuable insight
about how residential environments can influence behaviours
and health. For example, people who live in lower SES neigh-
bourhoods may encounter significant barriers to adopting and
maintaining healthy behaviours (for example, few or no gro-
cery stores with affordable fresh produce, few or no pharma-
cies or safe places to exercise, limited public transportation
and access to health care). In addition, they may be more
likely to be exposed to hazardous environments (for example,
crime, poor air or water quality) compared with people who
live in higher SES neighbourhoods. In response to such
inequalities, health professionals can be important advocates
in promoting healthy neighbourhoods. This includes support
of public policies that regulate fast food, alcohol, tobacco, and
firearms availability as well as support of affordable health
care services and medications.
To address social inequalities in mortality, we support a
broad health policy agenda that integrates a focus on
race/ethnicity, SES, and the social environment, such as the
newly created National Center on Minority Health and Health
Disparities (www.nih.gov) and the Canadian Institutes of
Health Research (www.cihr.ca). A broad focus on socioeco-
nomic inequalities has many advantages. It acknowledges the
important demographic trends in immigration and intermar-
riage that have made the classification of people by race and
ethnicity less valid over time as the number of persons from
multiethnic backgrounds increase. It also ensures the inclu-
sion of all low SES populations in health initiatives and
guidelines, and achieves a more equitable access to resources.
Finally, it creates a more valid scientific ground for research on
health disparities that goes beyond individual level SES and
race/ethnicity, and furthers an understanding that social, eco-
nomic, and political factors are fundamental causes of poor
health.50
