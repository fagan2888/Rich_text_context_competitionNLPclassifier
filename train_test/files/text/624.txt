Between the time that two large, national surveys were conducted, the Second National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (1976­1980) and the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994),
prevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection in the United States increased by 30%. From these
survey data, the authors estimated the incidence of HSV-2 infection in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population
aged 12 years by means of a mathematical model that allowed overall incidence to increase linearly with time
but required the shape of the age-specific incidence curve to remain constant. From 1970 to 1985, annual
incidence of HSV-2 infection in HSV-2-seronegative persons increased by 82%, from 4.6 per 1,000 (95%
confidence interval: 4.2, 5.0) to 8.4 per 1,000 (95% confidence interval: 7.7, 9.1). Incidence in 1985 was higher
in women than in men (9.9 vs. 6.9 per 1,000), higher in Blacks than in Whites (20.4 vs. 6.3 per 1,000), and
highest in the group aged 20­29 years (14.6 and 22.5 per 1,000 in men and women, respectively). Thus, by
1985, approximately 1,640,000±150,000 persons (730,000 men and 910,000 women) were being infected
annually with HSV-2. Am J Epidemiol 2001;153:912­20.

Parts of this paper were presented at the Conference on
Advances in Mathematical Modeling of Sexually Transmitted
Diseases, Santa Fe, New Mexico, April 1999, and at the 13th
Meeting of the International Society for Sexually Transmitted
Diseases Research, Denver, Colorado, July 1999.
Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the most frequent
cause of genital herpes in the United States and can infect
the skin, anorectum, oral mucosa, eyes, and central nervous
system (1­3). Infection in immunocompromised hosts
results often in severe local disease and occasionally in dis-
seminated disease. Infection during pregnancy, particularly
around the time of delivery (4­7), places the infant at risk
for neonatal herpes, a frequently devastating disease with
high mortality and a high rate of permanent neurologic
impairment among survivors (8, 9). This virus is spread
through intimate contact and is often unrecognized; infec-
tion is commonly asymptomatic, and viral shedding may
occur intermittently for years in the absence of symptoms
(2, 10, 11).
Since the early 1970s, public awareness and concern
about genital herpes have increased considerably, in part
because of the impression that the burden of HSV-2-related
disease has been rising (12). From the late 1960s to the mid-
1990s, the annual number of outpatient visits for genital her-
pes in the United States increased steadily from 20,000 to
over 150,000 (13). A recent national survey revealed that the
prevalence of antibody to HSV-2 in US residents aged 12
years or older had increased from 16.4 percent in the late
1970s to 21.9 percent in the early 1990s (14, 15). The
increase in prevalence was greatest in White teenagers and
young adults.
There are no nationally representative data on the inci-
dence of HSV-2 infection in the United States. Direct mea-
surement of incidence is difficult because infection is most
often asymptomatic and unrecognized. Furthermore, geni-
tal herpes infection is not reportable in most states.
Determining seroconversion rates in a large, representa-
tive cohort would be possible but costly. A more practical
approach is to estimate the past incidence of infection
from existing seroprevalence data by means of "catalytic
modeling" (16­20). We applied a variation of this method-
ology to data from the Second National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) and the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) to estimate the incidence of HSV-2 infec-
tion in the general population as well as the risk of infec-
tion during pregnancy.
Incidence of HSV-2 Infection 913
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 153, No. 9, 2001
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources
NHANES II and NHANES III were conducted from 1976
to 1980 and from 1988 to 1994, respectively (21, 22). Both
surveyed multistage, stratified, clustered samples of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized population to provide nation-
ally representative prevalence estimates for a variety of
health measures and conditions. From among participants
aged 12 years or older from whom serum samples were
available, a sample of 16,691 participants (3,597 from
NHANES II and 13,094 from NHANES III) was tested for
the presence of antibody to herpes simplex virus type 1
(HSV-1) and HSV-2 (15). Sera from both surveys were
tested in a single laboratory by using an antigen specific to
HSV-2 (glycoprotein gG-2) (23, 24). In persons with
culture-proven, recurrent genital herpes, the sensitivity and
specificity of this assay are more than 98 and 99 percent,
respectively (24). The prevalence of HSV-2 antibody in
these samples has been described previously (14, 15).
General description of the incidence models
Mathematical details of the models are given in the
Appendix. What follows is a general description of how the
models function.
The models estimated force of infection (25), which, for
the purposes of this paper, is considered synonymous with
annual incidence in the susceptible (i.e., seronegative) pop-
ulation. Force of infection was always modeled indepen-
dently for males and females and for three race/ethnic
groups: non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and
others (including Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians, and
Pacific Islanders), referred to in this paper as Whites,
Blacks, and others, respectively.
The past force of infection was modeled iteratively. At the
beginning of each iteration, the modeled force of infection
from the previous iteration was used to calculate what the
prevalence of antibody to HSV-2 would be at the time of
NHANES II and NHANES III (the "modeled prevalence").
The modeled prevalence was then compared with the actual
prevalence according to the two surveys, and the force of
infection was adjusted by using mathematical algorithms.
This process was repeated until further adjustments resulted
in no further improvement of the goodness of fit of the model
as measured by the weighted deviance (a lower weighted
deviance indicates a better fit of the model).
Because the seroprevalence of HSV-2 increased from
NHANES II to NHANES III, we assumed that incidence
had also increased. To model this increase, we assumed that
the force of infection had been constant up to a certain date,
year 0 (yr0
), and increased linearly thereafter. The values for
yr0
and for the rate of increase after yr0
were determined
empirically by determining which values resulted in the best
fit of the modeled prevalence to the actual prevalence.
The age-specific force-of-infection curve was determined
by regression analysis and was assumed to have a constant
shape but to increase in height after yr0
. The shape of this
curve was modeled by using three different methods, all of
which gave similar results. Results presented in this paper
are from the third model, which functioned much like a
locally weighted smoothing algorithm (26) in that the force
of infection estimated at a certain age depended most on the
prevalence of antibody to HSV-2 in survey participants who
were close to that age and little or not at all on the preva-
lence in survey participants who were much older or much
younger. Because acquisition of HSV-2 by pregnant women
around the time of birth increases the risk of neonatal HSV-
2 infection (7), we estimated the force of infection in women
during pregnancy by assuming that it would not change as a
result of the pregnancy.
Standardization
In most instances, force of infection was averaged across
ages, races, and genders after weighting with the 1990
civilian, noninstitutionalized population and adjusting for
the estimated prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the year of
interest. The number of infections in 1985 was estimated by
using the intercensal estimate of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population in that year. To estimate the risk of
seroconversion during pregnancy, force of infection in
women was weighted by using the 1996 US natality data
set (27).
RESULTS
The three models produced similar estimates of age-,
race-, and gender-specific force of infection. In all instances,
differences between the models were small relative to the
estimated standard errors. Therefore, only those results from
the third model, which best fit the data, are presented here.
As with the others, this model fit the observed seropreva-
lence well, especially that from the much larger NHANES
III survey (figure 1).
Choice of time-dependent parameters
The estimated force of infection in any year varied with
the placement of yr0
(figure 2). Nonetheless, the annual
force of infection prior to the 1970s (4­5 per 1,000) and in
the mid-1980s (8­9 per 1,000) depended little on the choice
of yr0
(figures 2 and 3). Therefore, this paper provides
results for only two periods: "before 1970" and 1985.
The goodness of fit was relatively insensitive to the
choice of yr0
as long as it was placed between 1970
(weighted deviance, 2,091) and 1980 (weighted deviance,
2,083). For this reason, yr0
was not chosen solely on the
basis of statistical considerations. Rather, 1970 was chosen
because published data showed that outpatient visits for
genital herpes began to rise in about 1970 (12, 13, 28).
The model fit best when the annual rates of increase in
force of infection were set to 7, 2, and 9 percent of the pre-
1970 baselines for Whites, Blacks, and others, respectively.
Within each race/ethnic group, the estimated rates of
increase, as a percentage of the baseline force of infection,
were equal for males and females.

Force of infection, incidence, and prevalence of HSV-2
infection
The estimated annual force of infection increased from
4.6 per 1,000 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 4.2, 5.0)
before 1970 to 8.4 per 1,000 (95 percent CI: 7.7, 9.1) in
1985, a relative increase of 82 percent (figure 4). During this
time, increases in prevalence of HSV-2 infection would
have lagged behind increases in force of infection. In the
overall population (aged 0 years or older), prevalence would
have risen from 13.6 percent to 15.7 percent between 1970
and 1985, a relative increase of only 16 percent. Taking into
account the increasing seroprevalence, the incidence aver-
aged over the entire US population (i.e., the combined HSV-
2-seronegative and -seropositive population) would have
increased from 4.0 per 1,000 (95 percent CI: 3.7, 4.3) to 7.1
per 1,000 (95 percent CI: 6.5, 7.6) between 1970 and 1985,
a relative increase of 78 percent.
The age-specific force of infection in 1985 increased with
age to a peak of 14.6 and 22.5 per 1,000 in men and women
aged 20­29 years and then declined to 2.6 and 3.4 per 1,000
in men and women aged 50 years or older (table 1). In all
age groups, the force of infection was higher in Blacks than
in Whites and higher in women than in men (figure 5). The
disparity between men and women was greatest for adoles-
cents and young adults and least at the extremes of ages.
In 1985, the estimated number of new HSV-2 infections
in the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population was
1,670,000 (95 percent CI: 1,520,000, 1,820,000; table 2). A
total of 56 percent of the infections were estimated to have
occurred in women and 44 percent in men. The largest pro-
portion of infections occurred in those aged 20­29 years (38
percent), followed by persons aged 30­39 years (25 per-
cent), and those aged 12­19 years (17 percent).
In seronegative women, the risk of acquiring HSV-2 dur-
ing a 9-month pregnancy increased from 9.1 per 1,000 preg-
nancies (95 percent CI: 8.1, 10.2) before 1970 to 16.7 per
1,000 pregnancies (95 percent CI: 14.6, 18.9) in 1985. This
risk was greatest in the group aged 20­29 years (18.5 per
1,000, 95 percent CI: 15.3, 21.7). Because 80.6 percent of
all women giving birth in 1985 would have been seronega-
tive for HSV-2 infection, the overall rate of HSV-2 infection
during pregnancy among all pregnant women would have
been 13.5 per 1,000 (95 percent CI: 12.0, 15.0) in that year.
DISCUSSION
Using a novel adaptation of a method to model infection
rates from seroprevalence data, we estimated that the annual
incidence of new HSV-2 infections in uninfected persons in
the United States in the mid-1980s was approximately 8.4
per 1,000. Rates were higher in women than in men, higher
in Blacks than in other race/ethnic groups, and, in general,
highest during the third decade of life.
The results of this model are consistent with other pub-
lished estimates of incidence in European and North
American populations. In a prospectively studied cohort of
Swedish girls born in 1958 and 1959, HSV-2 seroconversion
occurred at annual rates of 5, 24, and 23 per 1,000 from ages
13 to 18, 17 to 22, and 21 to 29 years, respectively (29). In a
cohort of US university students in the mid-1980s, the annual
seroconversion rate was 20 per 1,000 (30, 31). In pregnant
women in Washington State and Birmingham, Alabama, 16
and 20 per 1,000 seronegative women, respectively, serocon-
verted over the course of their pregnancy (7, 31), corre-
sponding to respective annual rates of 21 and 27 per 100,000.
During two recent HSV-2 vaccine trials, groups of women
and men at increased risk for infection seroconverted at rates
of 68 and 44 per 1,000, respectively (32). Among women
attending an antenatal clinic in London, United Kingdom, in
1980 and 1981, Ades et al. (19) estimated seroconversion
rates of 2.4, 5, and 20 per 1,000 pregnancies in Asians,
Whites, and Blacks, respectively, on the basis of a model that
assumed a constant rate of acquisition.
The peak incidence in persons aged 20­29 years is con-
sistent with studies in the United States and the United
Kingdom showing that outpatient visits for genital herpes
reach their maximum in this age group (12, 27, 33). This is
older than the peak age for notifications in the United States
of acute bacterial, sexually transmitted diseases such as

chlamydia and gonorrhea, which are reported most fre-
quently in women in their late teens and men in their early
twenties (13). This finding may reflect the chronic nature of
the infection, in that a person infected at a young age who
continues to shed the virus intermittently may infect others
for many years, even long after entering into a stable,
monogamous relationship. Thus, as birth cohorts age, the
pool of potentially infectious persons increases.
The high estimated incidence in the second and third
decades of life underscores the need to focus prevention
efforts on both teenagers and young adults. Prevention mes-
sages should include practicing healthful sexual behavior
such as reducing the number of sexual partners. Promoting
regular condom use is prudent, although few data support
their effectiveness in preventing HSV-2 transmission (31,
34). An effective vaccine against HSV-2 would provide an
invaluable prevention tool; developing an HSV-2 vaccine
remains a field of active investigation despite disappointing
results thus far from published large-scale clinical trials (35,
36).
We estimate that the rate of HSV-2 seroconversion per
1,000 pregnancies in 1985 was 16.7, which, given the 3.76
million US livebirths that year (37) and the estimated preva-
lence of HSV-2-susceptible mothers (81 percent, data not
shown) implies that 51,000 women would have become
newly infected with HSV-2 during their pregnancy in that
year. The prevalence of antibody to HSV-1 in HSV-2-
negative women would have been 39 percent (data, not
shown, from NHANES III); thus, 20,000 would have repre-
sented primary infections (i.e., HSV-2 infections in women
without prior HSV infection), and 31,000 would have repre-
sented nonprimary first infections (i.e., HSV-2 infections in
women with prior HSV-1 infections). Children of these
women would be at the highest risk for neonatal infection if
they were born during the time window between infection and
HSV-2 seroconversion. If viral shedding during this window
lasts 11.4 days in primary infection and 6.8 days in nonpri-
mary first infection (38), and a constant risk of acquisition of
HSV-2 throughout pregnancy is assumed (7), then 1,600
neonates would be at risk each year as a result of new mater-
nal HSV-2 infections. Approximately 37 percent of these (6,
7), or 600, would become infected. Neonatal HSV-1 infection
would account for approximately half as many cases (6­8),
bringing the total to 900 neonatal herpes infections annually
as a result of primary and nonprimary first maternal infec-
tions. This figure is consistent with another estimate of
700­2,300 cases of neonatal herpes annually in the United
States (39) and is higher than the rate of neonatal herpes
observed in King County, Washington, in the early 1980s
(11.9 per 100,000 births, corresponding to 450 cases in a birth
cohort of 3.76 million) (40).
These rates of seroconversion per pregnancy are predicated
on similar forces of infection in pregnant and nonpregnant
women. However, pregnant women may engage in sexual
intercourse less often, may be less likely to change partners,
and may have other characteristics that put them at lower risk

in the time
period before yr

for HSV-2 infection relative to nonpregnant women.
Conversely, other factors, such as decreased condom use or
increased partner changing, could increase this risk.
Persons citing our results should understand their limita-
tions. As with any model, the estimates and confidence inter-
vals are conditional on the assumptions of the model. The
confidence intervals, for example, do not account for uncer-
tainties in yr
0
and the rate of increase over time or for uncer-
tainties about the dynamics of this increase. Also, estimates of
incidence in the oldest age groups should be considered less
reliable than those in younger age groups, since the preva-
lence in the former can be greatly affected by the incidence in
younger age groups. Thus, the prevalence in older age groups
may be subject to cohort effects not taken into account by the
model. Furthermore, recent studies have documented that
HSV-2 antibody levels in infected persons occasionally fall
below the level of detection (41). Such seroreversion would
cause our model to underestimate incidence.
We chose to model the increase in force of infection over
time as a simple linear function; our model included data
from only two points in time and thus did not allow a more
complex analysis. In reality, the increase was almost cer-
tainly nonlinear and may have varied by age group. For this
reason, and because the estimates of incidence in the late
1980s depended greatly on the value chosen for yr
0
, it would
be a mistake to extrapolate our results beyond the mid-
1980s. Furthermore, since the incidence of gonorrhea,
syphilis, chlamydia, and primary human immunodeficiency
virus infection has probably decreased since the early 1990s
(42­44), the upward trend in the incidence of HSV-2 infec-
tion may also have reversed, although condom use, which
may account for much of the decline in the incidence of sex-
ually transmitted disease, is probably less effective in pre-
venting HSV-2 transmission.
The estimated 82 percent increase in incidence from 1970
to 1985 is considerably greater than the 16 percent relative
increase in prevalence we estimated to have occurred during
this time or the 34 percent relative increase in HSV-2 sero-
prevalence between the time that NHANES II and
NHANES III were conducted (15). Trends in the overall
seroprevalence of infectious diseases generally lag behind
trends in incidence and may not reflect them accurately. For
example, if the incidence of HSV-2 infection increased sub-
stantially in the 1970s and 1980s, as we believe it did, then
overall seroprevalence may currently be increasing even if
incidence has stabilized or is decreasing slightly. Factors
other than increasing incidence could have contributed to
the observed increase in HSV-2 seroprevalence, although
their effects would likely have been very small: a decreasing
age at acquisition or a decreasing mortality rate among

FIGURE 5. Force of infection (annual incidence in the susceptible (i.e., seronegative) population) of herpes simplex virus type 2 in Blacks and
Whites, by age group and gender, United States, 1985. The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals estimated by using balanced repeat
replication. Force of infection in the youngest age group was close to 0, with wide confidence intervals, and is not shown. Force of infection in
the older age groups should be considered less reliable, for reasons stated in the Discussion section of the text.
populations at high risk for HSV-2 infection would both
have caused prevalence to increase.
The next NHANES survey is now in progress and will
soon provide new estimates of the seroprevalence of HSV-2
in the United States. These data can be incorporated into our
model as they become available, making the results more
robust. Data from teenagers and young adults will be espe-
cially important, since prevalence among these persons is
most sensitive to recent changes in incidence and is thus more
useful for delineating trends. If the current trend of increasing
prevalence is to be reversed, strong prevention efforts will be
needed as well as new technologies, such as vaccines.

APPENDIX
Mathematical Details of the Models
All models assumed that infection always resulted in
seroconversion, seroreversion was rare, and infection was
not associated with increased mortality. Although the mod-
els did not take into account the effects of prior HSV-1
infection on HSV-2 acquisition, the prevalence of HSV-1
did not change between NHANES II and NHANES III;
therefore, any effects from HSV-1 would have been stable
during this time. The models assumed that force of infec-
tion, , was both age and time dependent and could be
expressed as a product of two functions:
(a,yr)  f(a)*g(yr)
in which f(a) was the baseline age-specific force of infection
at age a and g(yr) was the time-dependent multiplier in year
yr. Estimated prevalence at any given age A in the year of a
survey, yrs
, P(A,yrs
), was estimated as

We modeled f(a) separately with three different functions,
which were chosen because they allowed force of infection
to increase with age, then decrease, and finally to level off
at older ages. In all models, several parameters were mod-
eled by regression analysis, including the age at which force
of infection peaked, the force of infection at this peak, and
the force of infection in the oldest age groups.
The first model assumed that infection did not occur
before age 10 years and that the baseline force of infection
was constant with respect to age in persons aged 50 years or
older. Baseline force of infection between ages 10 and 50
years was described by a polynomial,
in which the s were coefficients that could be estimated in
a generalized linear model.
The second model assumed that
in which 
max
was the maximum baseline force of infection,
apeak
was the age at which this maximum occurred,  was a
parameter inversely related to the width of the age range at
highest risk for infection, 
late
was the baseline force of
infection at older ages, and STEP(apeak
) was a Heavyside
function equal to 0 before apeak
and 1 thereafter. The four
parameters were estimated by using nonlinear regression
analysis after specifying a large grid of starting values.

In the third model, the mean baseline force of infection
was taken from K different submodels. In each submodel,
f(a) was modeled as a step function with a finite number of
steps of width K years, followed by a final step of variable
width. The first step began at age 0 years in the first sub-
model, age 1 year in the second model, age 2 years in the
third model, and so on. In the nth step of the kth submodel,
f(k,a)  
k,n
. After each of the K submodels was fit inde-
pendently to the data, f(a) was taken as the mean of the s
that included that particular age. K was varied from 6 to 20
to find the minimum value that produced a smooth, age-
specific, force-of-infection curve.
In all models, g(yr) was assumed to be 1.0 prior to a cer-
tain year, yr0
, and to increase linearly thereafter by m per-
cent of the baseline. yr0
and m were determined empirically
by varying yr0
from 1940 to 1988, determining the value of
m that produced the best fit of the model for each yr0
, and
then charting goodness of fit by yr0
.
The modeling was performed with SAS software (SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina). The models were fit with
either PROC GENMOD, a generalized linear modeling pro-
cedure (first and third models), or PROC NLIN, a nonlinear
modeling procedure (second model), such that the estimated
prevalence, P(A,yrs
), matched the actual prevalence
observed in the two surveys. Goodness of fit was assessed
by the weighted deviance (minus two times the logarithm of
the unconditional binomial likelihood ratio, weighted with
the normalized survey weight). Variance was estimated by
using Faye's variation of the balance repeat replicate
method (45). Replicate weights were calculated with WES-
VARPC software (WESTAT, Rockville, Maryland).
