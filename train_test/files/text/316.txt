OBJECTIVE -- The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is high among U.S. adults. Our
purpose was to determine whether the prevalence of this syndrome has changed since 1988­
1994.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A total of 6,436 men and women aged 20
years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988­1994)
and 1,677 participants from NHANES 1999­2000 were included in the analyses. We used the
definition of the metabolic syndrome developed by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol
Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cho-
lesterol in Adults.
RESULTS -- The unadjusted prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 23.1% in NHANES
III and 26.7% in NHANES 1999­2000 (P  0.043), and the age-adjusted prevalences were 24.1
and 27.0% (P  0.088), respectively. The age-adjusted prevalence increased by 23.5% among
women (P  0.021) and 2.2% among men (P  0.831). Increases in high blood pressure, waist
circumference, and hypertriglyceridemia accounted for much of the increase in the prevalence of
the metabolic syndrome, particularly among women.
CONCLUSIONS -- The increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is likely to lead to
future increases in diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

In 2001, the Third Report of the Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Program
Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation,
and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol
in Adults (NCEP/ATP III) provided a
working definition of the metabolic syn-
drome based on five commonly measured
clinical criteria that clinicians could im-
plement in their practices (1). Using these
criteria, we estimated that the unadjusted
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome
among U.S. adults was 21.7% during
1988­1994 (2). Since then, the preva-
lence of the metabolic syndrome using
NCEP/ATP III criteria has been described
for other study populations. The preva-
lence of the metabolic syndrome among
participants of the Framingham Offspring
Study and San Antonio Heart Study
ranged from 21.3 to 32.8% during the
early to mid-1990s (3). High prevalences
have been noted among patients infected
with the human immunodeficiency virus
(4), Filipina women (5), and Native
Americans (6). In addition, the NCEP/
ATP III criteria have been applied in other
countries (7­9). Recent work has shown
that people with the metabolic syndrome
based on the NCEP/ATP III criteria are at
increased risk for diabetes and cardiovas-
cular disease (7,8,10,11).
Obesity and physical activity are two
important determinants of the metabolic
syndrome (12­15). Because the preva-
lence of obesity has continued to increase
in the U.S. during the 1990s (16,17), we
theorized that the prevalence of the met-
abolic syndrome among adults had in-
creased as well. To test this hypothesis,
we used data from two national surveys:
the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES) III and
NHANES 1999­2000.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- According to the
NCEP/ATP III report, participants who
had three or more of the following criteria
were defined as having the metabolic
syndrome: abdominal obesity: waist cir-
cumference 102 cm in men and 88
cm in women; hypertriglyceridemia:
150 mg/dl (1.695 mmol/l); low HDL
cholesterol: 40 mg/dl (1.036 mmol/l)
in men and 50 mg/dl (1.295 mmol/l)
in women; high blood pressure: 130/85
mmHg; and high fasting glucose: 110
mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l). Because a revision
of the glucose criterion of the metabolic
syndrome was recently announced (18),
we also report the prevalence of the met-
abolic syndrome using a glucose cut point
of 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l).
In both NHANES III (1988­1994)
and NHANES 1999­2000, the sample
was recruited using a multistage stratified
sampling design. Both surveys were spe-
cifically designed to produce results that
are representative of the civilian noninsti-
tutionalized U.S. population. Participants
were interviewed at home and were in-
vited to attend the mobile examination
center, where they were asked to com-
plete additional questionnaires, undergo
various examinations, and provide a
blood sample. Details about the surveys
may be found elsewhere (19­21).
In both surveys, the waist circumfer-
ence was measured at the high point of
the iliac crest at minimal respiration to the
nearest 0.1 cm. Serum triglyceride con-
centration was measured enzymatically

after hydrolyzation to glycerol, and HDL
cholesterol was measured after the pre-
cipitation of other lipoproteins with a he-
parin-manganese chloride mixture.
Plasma glucose concentration was mea-
sured using an enzymatic reaction.
Up to three blood pressure readings
were obtained in the mobile examination
center in NHANES III and up to four such
readings in NHANES 1999­2000. To
maintain consistency between the two
surveys, we used the average of the last
two measurements of blood pressure for
participants who had three or four mea-
surements, the last measurement for par-
ticipants with only two measurements,
and the only measurement for partici-
pants who had one measurement to estab-
lish high blood pressure status. For both
surveys, we counted participants who re-
ported currently using antihypertensive
or antidiabetic medication (insulin or oral
agents) as participants with high blood
pressure or diabetes, respectively. Be-
cause of increases in the percentage of
participants who reported using choles-
terol-lowering medications between the
two surveys (22) and because these med-
ications can also reduce triglyceride con-
centration, we calculated the prevalence
of the metabolic syndrome using hyper-
triglyceridemia once based on serum tri-
glyceride concentration alone and again
based on serum triglyceride concentra-
tion or the use of cholesterol-lowering
medications.
Concentrations of plasma glucose
and serum triglycerides were measured
using reference analytic methods only for
NHANES 1999­2000 participants who
attended the morning examination.
Therefore, we limited the analyses of both
surveys to men and nonpregnant women
aged 20 years who attended the morn-
ing medical examination and who had
fasted 8 h. We calculated the prevalence
of the metabolic syndrome by age and sex.
Because of the limited sample size for the
racial or ethnic groups in NHANES
1999­2000, we do not present results for
these subgroups. To age-adjust statistics,
we directly adjusted to the U.S. popula-
tion aged 20 years in the year 2000. To
test the statistical significance of the
changes in the prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome between the two surveys,
we performed a t test. The pooled stan-
dard error for the difference in means was
calculated by taking the square root of the
sum of the squared standard errors. We
used Software for the Statistical Analysis
of Correlated Data (SUDAAN) for analy-
ses to account for the complex sampling
design. Prevalence estimates were calcu-
lated using the sampling weights so that
the estimates are representative of the ci-
vilian noninstitutionalized U.S. popula-
tion. Although we focus the presentation
of results on the revised NCEP/ATP III
definition of the metabolic syndrome, we
also present results for the original defini-
tion of the metabolic syndrome.
RESULTS -- The number of partici-
pants who were included in the analyses
based on participants who attended the
morning examination were 6,436 for
NHANES III and 1,677 for NHANES
1999­2000. The age, sex, racial or ethnic,
and educational status composition of the
two analytic samples was similar.
Of the five metabolic syndrome com-
ponents, significant increases in the
prevalences of abdominal obesity, hyper-
triglyceridemia, and high blood pressure
occurred among women between the two
surveys (Table 1). Increases in the preva-
lences of abdominal obesity and high
blood pressure were of borderline signif-
icance among men. Changes in hypertri-
glyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol
concentration, and hyperglycemia were
not statistically significant.
In both surveys, the prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome increased with age
(Table 2). In NHANES III, men had a
slightly higher age-adjusted prevalence
than women (P  0.610). However, that
was not found in NHANES 1999­2000,
where the prevalence among women
showed a trend to be greater than that
among men (P  0.177).
The unadjusted prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome increased from
23.1% in NHANES III to 26.7% in
NHANES 1999­2000 (P  0.043). The
age-adjusted prevalence of the metabolic
syndrome increased from 24.1% in
NHANES III to 27.0% in NHANES
1999­2000 (P  0.088). Among women,
the unadjusted prevalence increased by a
relative 25.8% (P  0.016), and the age-
adjusted prevalence increased by 23.5%
(P  0.021). Corresponding increases
among men were much smaller and were
not statistically significant. Among
women, increases occurred among all
age-groups, and the increase among
women aged 20­39 years was significant.
Among men, nonsignificant increases oc-

Metabolic syndrome prevalence trends
2446 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 27, NUMBER 10, OCTOBER 2004
people with diabetes in prevalence esti-
mates of the metabolic syndrome, we re-
calculated the prevalence estimates after
excluding participants with self-reported
diabetes or a fasting plasma glucose con-
centration 126 mg/dl (6.99 mmol/l)
(Table 3). The unadjusted prevalence was
18.9% in NHANES III and 22.6% in
NHANES 1999 ­2000 (P  0.019),
whereas the age-adjusted prevalence in-
creased from 20.3 to 23.3% (P  0.044).
The relative increases in prevalence
among participants without diabetes ex-
ceeded the increases for all participants
shown in Table 2.
We examined the effect of counting
participants who reported using choles-
terol-lowering medications as having hy-
pertriglyceridemia, because these agents
can cause substantial reductions in tri-
glyceride concentrations. The age-
adjusted prevalence changed from 24.4%
in NHANES III to 28.1% in NHANES
1999­2000 (P  0.016). However, this
analysis may have overestimated the prev-
alence of the metabolic syndrome because
it assumes that all participants who used
such medications may have had hypertri-
glyceridemia when some proportion of
these participants had a normal concen-
tration of triglycerides.
To examine the impact of the increase
of obesity on the prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome, we conducted two sets of
analyses. First, after eliminating waist cir-
cumference as one of the criteria of the
metabolic syndrome, the age-adjusted
prevalence of having three or four of the
remaining four criteria was 13.5% in
NHANES III and 13.0% in NHANES
1999­2000. Second, we examined the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome
stratified by BMI categories (25, 25 to
30, 30 to 35, and 35 kg/m2) and
calculated the prevalence adjusted for the
BMI distribution from NHANES III. In
NHANES III, the prevalence adjusted for
the four categories of BMI was 23.1%
among all participants, 22.8% among
men, and 23.8% among women. In
NHANES 1999­2000, the prevalences
were 23.5, 21.3, and 26.9%, respectively.
Because it is unclear how commonly
health care professionals measure waist
circumference on their patients and be-
cause the use of BMI to assess obesity has
been heavily promoted, we examined
what cut points for BMI would generate
equivalent prevalences of the metabolic
syndrome. A BMI 29.2 kg/m2 among
men and 24.9 kg/m2 among women in
NHANES III and a BMI 28.7 kg/m2
among men and 24.8 kg/m2 among
women in NHANES 1999­2000 pro-
vided very close agreement in prevalence
estimates using BMI instead of waist cir-
cumference. Although the cut points we
identified for BMI may result in similar
prevalence estimates for the population,
using BMI instead of waist circumference
to identify the metabolic syndrome in an
individual may result in wrongly classify-
ing that individual as having or not having
the metabolic syndrome according to the
NCEP/ATP III criteria.
CONCLUSIONS -- Between 1988­
1994 and 1999­2000, a significant in-
crease in the prevalence of the metabolic
syndrome occurred among U.S. adults
aged 20 years, particularly women.
Among people without diabetes, the rela-
tive increase exceeded that among all par-
ticipants. Increases in the prevalence of
abdominal obesity and high blood pres-
sure, and to a lesser degree hypertriglyc-
eridemia and low HDL cholesterol
concentration, most likely accounted for
much of this increase.
Recently, the American Diabetes As-
sociation changed the definition of im-
paired fasting glucose by lowering the
glucose threshold to 100 mg/dl from 110
mg/dl (23). This change, which was in-
corporated into the NCEP/ATP III defini-
tion of the metabolic syndrome (18),
raised the prevalence of this syndrome by
about an absolute 5%. Under the original
NCEP/ATP III definition, the unadjusted
prevalence in this analysis was 23.1% in
NHANES III and 26.7% in NHANES
1999­2000. With the modification of the
glucose threshold, the prevalence in-
creased to 28.0 and 31.9%, respectively.
On the basis of the 1990 census num-
bers for U.S. adults aged 20 years
(177 million) and the prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome based on the original
definition calculated from NHANES III
data, about 41 million people had the
metabolic syndrome in 1990. Because of
growth of the population (201 million
people were aged 20 years in 2000) and
the increase in the prevalence of the met-
abolic syndrome, 55 million people had
the metabolic syndrome in 2000. Using
prevalence estimates of the metabolic syn-
drome based on the revised definition, we
estimate that 50 million people had the
metabolic syndrome in 1990 and 64
million people in 2000.
The five components of the metabolic
syndrome were measured similarly in the
two surveys. Thus, the changes in the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome
were not due to methodological changes.
Because we only included participants
who attended the morning examination
in this analysis, the estimates of the prev-
alence of the metabolic syndrome differ
slightly from those of our previous analy-
sis of NHANES III data. The smaller sam-
ple size of NHANES 1999 ­20000
reduced the statistical power to detect sig-
nificant changes in many demographic
subgroups.
A noteworthy finding was the large
increases in the prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome among women compared
with men. In particular, the prevalence of
this syndrome escalated rapidly among
women aged 20­39 years. Large increases
in the prevalences of hypertriglyceride-
mia and high blood pressure were largely
responsible for the increase among
women.
Two important determinants of the
metabolic syndrome are obesity and
physical activity. The prevalence of obe-
sity increased from 22.9 to 30.5% in the
U.S. between NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2000 (16). Our analyses show that
the increase in BMI accounted for much of
the increase in the prevalence of the met-
abolic syndrome. Leisure-time physical
activity levels have been relatively stable
from 1990 to 1998 (24). Little is known
about trends in other components of
physical activity such as occupational
physical activity and transportation-
related physical activity. Some informa-
tion suggests that people are relying
increasingly on their cars for transporta-
tion instead of nonmotorized forms of
transportation such as walking or bicy-
cling (25).
The clinical significance of the meta-
bolic syndrome remains controversial,
and much remains to be learned about it.
It is not clear if the syndrome is a disease
or simply a constellation of risk factors
(26). The etiology of the metabolic syn-
drome is also controversial, with obesity,
insulin resistance, and other etiologies be-
ing advocated. By focusing on the meta-
bolic syndrome, the NCEP/ATP III
reinforced the need for health care profes-
sionals to take a more comprehensive ap-
proach to their patients and to address all

relevant risk factors that increase the risk
for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
events. The metabolic syndrome may be
viewed as a useful window on the health
of the U.S. population. Consequently, the
increase in the prevalence of this syn-
drome is a worrisome indicator of future
increases in diabetes and cardiovascular
disease.
Because the metabolic syndrome is
extremely common in the U.S. popula-
tion and its prevalence is increasing,
health care professionals are likely to en-
counter patients with this syndrome in
their practice. It remains unknown to
what extent health care professionals have
adopted the recommendations concern-
ing the metabolic syndrome made by the
NCEP/ATP III and are screening their pa-
tients for this syndrome. Measurements of
blood pressure and concentrations of trig-
lycerides, HDL cholesterol, and glucose
are commonly collected in clinical prac-
tice. Whether waist circumference is rou-
tinely measured at present is unknown.
To stem the rising tides of obesity and
the metabolic syndrome, comprehensive
approaches for improving nutrition and
physical activity habits that target both in-
dividuals and the population are required
(27). Health care professionals have a crit-
ical role in preventing the development of
the metabolic syndrome in their patients
through weight management and the
achievement of proper physical activity
levels. Because the syndrome is reversible,
health care professionals can help their
patients with this syndrome adopt pre-
ventive lifestyles that are conducive to de-
veloping and reversing this syndrome. In
addition, health care professionals must
assist patients with the metabolic syn-
drome in averting or delaying progression
to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
other complications. Although pharma-
cological therapy for each of the compo-
nents of this syndrome is available, the
role of such therapy in the absence of life-
style changes deserves clarification. Fur-
thermore, pharmacological approaches
specific to patients with this syndrome
await development.
