Introduction
Japan is a highly developed country with the longest life
and healthy life expectancies globally (World Health
Organization (WHO), 2003). This is due in part to reduced
socioeconomic disparities (Marmot and Smith, 1989;
Ohtake, 2005; Wilkinson, 1992) and a weak relationship
between socioeconomic status (SES) and healthy lifestyles
(Anzai et al., 2000; Nakamura et al., 1994). However, Japan
ranks near the middle of nations in happiness and is the
unhappiest of industrialized countries (Inglehart, 1990).
Also, happiness rates have remained steady since the 1960s
(Veenhoven, 2004). Because of the disparity between phys-
ical and economic indicators and subjective life evalua-
tions, studies that measure happiness and well-being in
multiple domains have drawn greater attention (Asada and
Ohkusa, 2004; Tokuda et al., 2008).
Quality of life (QOL) refers to one's satisfaction in impor-
tant domains of life as judged by one's own standards and
culture (WHOQOL Group, 1995). The World Health
Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) working group
has developed a comprehensive QOL assessment, the
WHOQOL-100, which consists of 100 items representing 24
facets of life organized into six domains (WHOQOL Group,
1998b). Its abbreviated version, the WHOQOL-BREF,
contains 26 items and is used for epidemiological surveys
and clinical trials (WHOQOL Group, 1998a). Psychometric
studies support the WHOQOL-BREF's validity for general
populations (Saxena et al., 2001; Skevington et al., 2004;
WHOQOL Group, 1998a) and in many countries (Min et al.,
2002; Noerholm et al., 2004; Xia et al., 2012; Yao et al.,
2002). However, some international studies failed to repli-
cate the original item structure (Moreno et al., 2006; Yao
et al., 2008). In Japan, the psychometric properties of the
WHOQOL-BREF have not been replicated since the original
field trial (Skevington et al., 2004), and the factor structure
has not yet been validated. Further studies on well-being
require a thorough psychometric assessment of the Japanese
WHOQOL-BREF.
Another important question regarding the WHOQOL-
BREF construct is whether men and women define QOL

Abstract
This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Japanese version of the WHOQOL-BREF among 10,693
community-based married Japanese men and women (4376 couples) who were either expecting or raising a child. Analyses
of item-response distributions, internal consistency, criterion validity, and discriminant validity indicated that the scale had
acceptable reliability and performed well in preliminary tests of validity. Furthermore, dyadic confirmatory factor analysis
revealed that the theoretical factor structure was valid and similar across partners, suggesting that men and women define
and value quality of life in a similar way.

similarly. Close relationships work to provide a key context
for well-being (Reis et al., 2000). As people get married,
have children, and age together in a shared life circum-
stances (e.g. social interactions, diets, lifestyles), one per-
son's satisfaction with life can affect their partner's
well-being. On the other hand, as QOL is a subjective expe-
rience (WHOQOL Group, 1995), the perceived satisfaction
with the living circumstances may vary across partners.
Among sparse literature investigating similarity in QOL
conceptualization across partners, Wang et al. (2006a)
showed that mothers and fathers of children with disabili-
ties did not differ in assessments of family QOL in terms of
measurement construct, weighted importance of factors, or
level of satisfaction. Nevertheless, whether QOL similarity
is generally true for a normative sample of married couples
with children is unknown. Thus, this study aims to provide
empirical evidence to validate the content equivalence of
the WHOQOL-BREF across married partners with chil-
dren. If the instrument measures the underlying QOL con-
struct equally across husbands and wives, further study to
investigate possible differences or similarities between
husbands' and wives' assessments of their well-being is
theoretically warranted.
This study used a large sample of married adults at dif-
ferent stages in their childrearing to thoroughly examine
the psychometric properties of the Japanese WHOQOL-
BREF and determined the construct validity of the instru-
ment by testing whether the factor structure had similar fit
for husbands and wives.
Method
Participants
Participants came from two studies. The Survey on
Pregnancy, Childbirth, and Child-Rearing assessed the
well-being of first-time parents and their experiences of
conception, birth, and childrearing, and their impact on
daily life. First-time pregnant women in the second half of
their pregnancies and their husbands as well as heterosex-
ual couples raising their first-born child (between 0 and
2
years of age) were randomly selected from Benesse
Educational Research and Development Institute's data-
base (Benesse Child Sciences and Parenting Research
Office, 2013). The survey was conducted in two rounds,
and in each, 8000 survey packets containing two identical
questionnaires for a couple were mailed to eligible house-
holds. Two postage-paid envelopes were included so that
partners could return their forms separately. In 2006, 4479
individuals responded (the response rate was 28.0%; 2588
wives and 1891 husbands), and in 2011, 4737 individuals
responded (29.6%; 2750 wives and 1987 husbands).
Participants were given a baby care gift worth ¥500.
Combining analyzable data yielded 9143 individuals (3738
matched couples, 1568 wives, and 99 husbands). The mean
age of the participants was 32.01
years (men: M=33.05,
standard deviation (SD)=5.25, range=18­57; women:
M=31.27, SD=4.55, range=16­47), with a median educa-
tion duration of 14years and a median adjusted household
income of ¥5.79million (as of March 2014, ¥1million was
the equivalent of US $7142).
The second sample was from an ongoing longitudinal
study, QOL and Mental Health across the Life Span Survey
(Sugawara et al., 2014). Heterosexual couples expecting a
child were recruited at hospitals and public health centers in
Kawasaki City and were followed periodically through mailed
surveys and interviews. Between October 2013 and March
2014, 1550 individuals (638 matched couples, 263 wives, and
11 husbands) participated in a follow-up survey. Participants
were each given a bookstore gift certificate worth ¥500. This
study was approved by the ethics committee at Ochanomizu
University. Participants had a mean age of 50.12
years (men:
M=51.62, SD
=
7.67, range: 34­71; women: M=49.03,
SD=6.65, range: 30­66), a median education of 14years, and
a median adjusted household income level of ¥9million. The
babies at the time of recruitment had since grown and were
between 10 and 30years old (median age, 18).
Instrument
The WHOQOL-BREF (WHOQOL Group, 1998a) consists
of 24 items, one each from the 24 facets of the
WHOQOL-100. These items are assumed to assess four
important domains of life: physical, psychological, social
relationships, and environment QOL. In addition, the
instrument contains two general items assessing general
QOL and general health. The Japanese WHOQOL-BREF
has been tested for content equivalence with the original
English version (Tazaki and Nakane, 1997). Scores for
each item range from 1 (poor) to 5 (good), with higher
scores indicating greater QOL.
Statistical analysis
Normality, reliability, and validity were assessed using
standard psychometric methods (Skevington et al., 2004;
WHOQOL Group, 1998b). Together with skewness and
kurtosis coefficients, the normality of the items was exam-
ined. Specifically, items were checked for floor and ceiling
effects, which were considered present if more than 15per-
cent of respondents belonged to the lowest/highest response
category (McHorney and Tarlov, 1995). Internal consist-
ency was assessed using Cronbach's , which is convention-
ally considered acceptable if it exceeds .70 (Cohen, 1988).
Criterion-related validity was evaluated by correlating each
item with its respective domain score (corrected for over-
lap). To assess discriminant validity, we examined the dif-
ference in mean scores of each item between the upper and
lower 30percent of participants with domain scores as crite-
ria (Findley, 1956). All analyses were conducted separately
Yoshitake et al. 3
by gender. Statistics were calculated using SPSS for
Windows version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, 2013).
We followed guidelines provided by Kenny et al.
(2006) for dyadic confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We
correlated the error terms of husbands and wives for each
item to account for the potential influence of marital
interaction on each partner's responses. The dyadic CFA
also includes a correlation between the latent factors of
the two persons. Next, we examined the factor invariance
for husbands and wives by comparing a model in which
loadings on each measure were free to vary for both
husbands and wives to a model where the paths from the
first-order factors to the second-order factor were set as
equal for the two members. If the latter model demon-
strated equal or better fit than the unconstrained model,
then the model was assumed to fit similarly between the
husbands and wives.
Several goodness-of-fit indices were examined to assess
and compare model fit. Comparative fit index (CFI) values
greater than .90 were considered to indicate a good fit
(Kline, 1998), whereas root mean square error of approxi-
mation (RMSEA) values ranging from .05 to .08 were pre-
ferred (Kenny and McCoach, 2003). Significant chi-square
comparisons of model fit indicate that the simpler model
(with fewer free parameters) should be rejected (Kenny
et al., 2006). Data were organized in a pairwise dyadic
structure, and CFA was conducted with AMOS (Arbuckle,
2013) for Windows version 22.0, using the maximum like-
lihood estimation method.
Ethical considerations
Permission to use the Japanese WHOQOL-BREF (Tazaki
and Nakane, 1997) was granted by paying a fee to the
distributor. Data collection was conducted by survey
companies in Tokyo, which carry the PrivacyMark certifi-
cation for personal information protection in compliance
with Japanese Industrial Standards. Participation was
voluntary and informed consent was obtained by filling
out questionnaires. Responses were anonymously indexed
so that personal information was not disclosed to the
researchers.
Results
Characteristics of study sample
Combining surveys, the overall sample size was 10,693
(including 4376 couples). The sociodemographic charac-
teristics of the sample are shown in Table 1.
Data quality
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for each WHOQOL-
BREF item for husbands and wives. Seven of the 26 items
had ceiling effects for both sexes, six of which were com-
mon for couples: pain and discomfort (Q3), medication
dependency (Q4), energy (Q5), spirituality (Q6), negative
feelings (Q26), and safety (Q8).
Coefficients of skewness fell between -1.0 and 1.0
for almost all items; two items for husbands (Q3 and Q4)
and one item for wives (Q4) had skewness coefficients
slightly beyond this range. Similarly, kurtosis coeffi-
cients for both sexes were satisfactory, with exception of
a few items exceeding this range (Q3 and Q4 for hus-
bands, and Q4 for wives). The mean and median item
scores further confirmed that participants considered
their QOL to be positive (Table 2). Less than 1percent of
participants (n=93, .9%) had missing data on more than
five items.
Internal consistency
Cronbach's  values are shown in Table 3. These were
acceptable for physical, psychological, and environment
domains (.72­.77), but poor for the social-relationships
domain (.61). Although removing one item regarding sex-
ual satisfaction (Q21) somewhat improved internal consist-
ency estimates, given that this domain has only three items
and that similar  values have been reported in a previous
study (Skevington et al., 2004), this item was retained in
further analyses.
Two of seven items in the physical domain had low cor-
relation coefficients with the other items in this domain for
both husbands and wives (Q4 and Q15; rs=.27­.34). In the
psychological domain, one item assessing negative feelings
(Q26) showed lower corrected item-total correlations for
husbands and wives. The sexual-activity item also showed
low correlation with other items in the social domain, sug-
gesting again that it might not be a good measure of social-
relationship quality.

Validity
As shown in Table 3, all items and domains were signifi-
cantly correlated with the generic items, general QOL (Q1)
and general health (Q2), for both husbands and wives. All
domain scores were moderately correlated with Q1 (r=.33­
.49) and Q2 (r
=
.28­.54). All individual items were also
fairly to moderately correlated with Q1 (r=.08­.44) and
Q2 (r=.17­.44). These results indicate that all items and all
four derived domain scores exhibited reasonable criterion
validity. The results of t-tests for item discrimination indi-
cated that item scores significantly differed between the
upper and lower 30percent of participants (Table 3). Thus,
all items were able to successfully discriminate between
two groups of participants for husbands and wives.
Dyadic CFA
The WHOQOL-BREF assumes a hierarchical structure in
which the four first-order domains are influenced by the
second-order factor, QOL. As recommended for CFA with
paired data, we constructed two identical QOL models for
husbands and wives and correlated the QOL factor and
errors across the same observed variables between couples
(Kenny et al., 2006). The initial model fit poorly: 2
(1047)=19723.87, CFI=.740, and RMSEA=.064. We then
modified the model by adding two pairs of error covari-
ance--between Q3 and Q4, and Q8 and Q9, as indicated by
previous studies (Li et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2012). Although
this modified model fit was still unsatisfactory, 2
(1044)=16454.41, CFI=.785, and RMSEA=.058, a chi-
square difference test indicated a significant improvement,
2 (df)=3269.46 (3), p<.01. Further modifications were
performed to explore possible improvements. Modification
indices suggested adding three more pairs of error covari-
ance (i.e. Q5 and Q6, Q12 and Q13, and Q18 and Q19) to
significantly improve model fit, 2 (1038)=12814.61,
CFI=.826, and RMSEA=.052, with 2 (df)=3639.8 (6),
p<.01.

Next, we tested whether the second-order WHOQOL-
BREF factor structure fit for both husbands and wives. We
tested a model in which the paths from the first-order fac-
tors to the second-order factor were constrained to be equal
for both husbands and wives. We then compared this model
with a model in which paths were free to vary between hus-
bands and wives. The constrained model demonstrated a
better fit than the unconstrained model, 2 (df)=28.38
(2), p
<
.01, suggesting a similar factor structure between
husbands and wives.
The final model is depicted in Figure 1 and standardized
estimates are shown in Table 4. For both husbands and
wives, all items had substantial factor loadings on corre-
sponding factors (.19­.77) and first-order factors had high
loadings on the common factor (.60­.99). In addition,
first-order factor loadings were similar between partners.
The correlation between second-order latent factor scores
was significant, r=.29, p<.01, indicating that husbands'and
wives' QOL reports correlated weakly, but significantly.
Domain scores within a couple
We examined the relationships and differences between
husbands' and wives' domain scores. We first assessed the
degree of homogeneity of QOL scores among partners by
testing the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC: R1
). The
ICCs were R1
=.16, .20, .16, and .34, for physical, psycho-
logical, social, and environment domains, respectively.
This indicated non-independent data clustered by dyads.
We then examined spousal profile similarity in QOL

except for the physical domain (men: M (SD)=14.35
(2.25), women: M (SD)=14.30 (2.27), t=1.17, n.s.).
Husbands scored higher in the psychological domain than
did wives (men: M (SD)=14.06 (2.43), women: M

Discussion
We examined the psychometric properties of the Japanese
WHOQOL-BREF in a large sample of married adults
expecting or raising a child and compared the instrument's
factor structure between partners. The instrument performed
well at assessing QOL of Japanese married adults, although
some areas require further attention.
Distribution analyses showed that 7 of the 26 items
exhibited ceiling effects and skew toward higher scores.
These positive QOL scores may reflect how most partici-
pants were in good health. However, "pain and discomfort"
(Q3) and "medication dependency" (Q4) are of concern
because nearly half of responses reached ceiling for both
husbands and wives. Furthermore, the contribution of these
items to the physical health domain was limited: the vari-
ance explained by Q3 was 7
percent for husbands and
10
percent for wives and by Q4 was 4
percent for both.
Considering the low dependency on medical treatment and
morbidity among adults aged 30­50years, these items may
not serve to differentiate individuals in our sample. Adding
an error covariance term between these items and addi-
tional four error covariance terms were necessary to gain
satisfactory fit. These paired items may have similar

content and their adjacent placement may lead to similar
responses.
The social-relationships domain demonstrated insuffi-
cient internal consistency for husbands and wives, in part
because of the small number of items in that domain
(Skevington et al., 2004) and the low sensitivity of Q21. As
in other Asian countries (Leung et al., 2005; Min et al.,
2002; Nedjat et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2006b), "sexual
activity" did not work reliably with other items in the social
domain. The item's contribution to the domain was low:
12
percent for husbands and 16
percent for wives, and the
high kurtosis may indicate that sexual life is a sensitive
topic (Tokuda et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2012). Therefore, sur-
vey confidentiality should be emphasized (Li et al., 2009).
Alternatively, this item may need rephrasing to better fit the
social domain or reorganizing as an independent domain
(Wang et al., 2006b). Future studies need to validate the
social domain by investigating correlations with other rela-
tionship measures.
Discriminant and criterion-related validity analyses dem-
onstrated that the instrument effectively assessed QOL in
Japanese married couples with children, in line with previ-
ous studies (Li et al., 2009; Skevington et al., 2004; Xia
et al., 2012). The construct validity was assessed using
dyadic CFA, which allows testing of the instrument's struc-
ture using couples. The fit of the theoretical structure was
acceptable, as shown previously (Min et al., 2002;
Skevington et al., 2004). Additionally, the similar factor
structures for husbands and wives suggested that both inter-
preted items similarly. Thus, gender differences in QOL can
now be interpreted as more than merely differences in how
husbands and wives define QOL. Finally, QOL reports were
weakly but significantly correlated within couples. Partners
agreed strongly in the environment domain, likely because a
married couple shares a home environment. Perceptions
of health and social relationships, however, were more
independent.
This study has several limitations. First, the data were a
combination of two distinct groups of married Japanese
couples--one with a mean age of 32 and the other with a
mean age of 50, and each with their children at considera-
bly different ages. Although the diversity of the sample was
warranted, the possible differences among the groups may
limit the generalizability of our study. Second, our valida-
tion results should be considered preliminary because their
verification was based on data distributions and may be
arbitrary. Further studies of the Japanese WHOQOL-BREF
should examine participants in various relationship stages,
including couples without children and unmarried adults.
The temporal stability should also be tested and the discri-
minant validity replicated using other outcome measures
such as depression scales, generic health assessments, and
screening interviews.
This study has practical implications. Although the
Japanese WHOQOL-BREF has been widely used for the
elderly and patients, studies among the general population
are rare. We revealed acceptable psychometric properties
and usefulness of the WHOQOL-BREF to assess QOL of
all Japanese adults, especially with families. This is the first
study to support the content validity of the WHOQOL-
BREF for both husbands and wives, indicating that partner
differences are likely to be true differences in QOL. Our
results support using the Japanese WHOQOL-BREF
among married adults to quantify QOL. This will help
researchers study QOL determinants in healthy couples and
improve implementation of the instrument.
