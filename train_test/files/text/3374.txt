Introduction
Second language acquisition requires some competencies
that L2 learners should master to conduct a successful com-
munication. When language learners attempt to express
themselves in L2 context, they encounter some barriers with
regard to pragmatic content of their utterances. This, some-
times, happens despite the learners' ability to use the lan-
guage properly at syntactic and semantic levels. In fact, even
though they are highly proficient as far as grammar and lexis
are concerned, L2 learners fail to express and interpret com-
municative functions in a particular context (Brock &
Nagasaka, 2005). Crystal (1985) defines pragmatics as
the study of language from the point of view of the users,
especially of the choices they make, the constraints they
encounter in using language in social interaction, and the effects
their use of language has on other participants in the act of
communication. (p. 240)
Given that, Glaser (2009) declares that high level of prag-
matic competence in the target language has a constructive
effect for successful communication within the L2 contexts.
Owing to this, L2 learners need to be exposed to pragmatic
content in their context of L2 learning.
ELT textbooks are among the various means used to pro-
vide L2 learners with pragmatic content represented in the
speech acts such as request, refusal, and apology. According
to Vellenga (2004), textbooks are among the most important
instructional materials that have to be considered as the vital
backbone for second/foreign language learning. As
Diepenbroek and Derwing (2013) suggest, considering the
significance of pragmatic knowledge in successful commu-
nication, material developers must give special attention to
the important role of English Language Teaching (ELT) text-
books in promoting learners' pragmatic competence in L2
classroom settings. Textbooks not only provide English as
Second/Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) learners with gram-
matical and lexical aspects of the L2, but they also present
pragmatic content that is necessary for the successful L2
learning.
Given the significant role pragmatic content plays in L2
material development for language learning, the purpose of
this study is to explore how pragmatic content, represented
as three speech acts of requesting, refusing, and apologizing,
is distributed in global and local ELT textbooks. Whereas
global ELT textbooks are prepared according to global norms
and are instructed around the world, local ELT textbooks are

Pragmatic Content in Global and Local
ELT Textbooks: A Micro Analysis Study
Hussein Meihami1 and Mobin Khanlarzadeh2
Abstract
This study is an attempt to explore the frequency of pragmatic content occurrence represented as three speech acts of
requesting, refusing, and apologizing in global and local English Language Teaching (ELT) textbooks. Three global elementary
ELT textbooks, namely Interchange, Top Notch, and American English File along with the local elementary textbooks of Iran
Language Institute (ILI) Series, were examined for their pragmatic content. To analyze the pragmatic content of these textbooks,
the researchers used three different frameworks. The results indicated that while both global and local ELT textbooks shared
a sufficient number of speech acts of request and refusal, they failed to pay enough attention to the speech act of apology
regarding its frequency and the strategies through which it is performed. To sum, the findings of this study highlight the
differences in the frequency of different speech acts and the strategies used to perform them in global and local elementary
ELT textbooks, which bear some implications for ELT textbook developers and language instructors.

prepared according to the norms of a particular EFL context.
This research, then, is an attempt to measure the pragmatic
content of both types of textbooks and finds out the differ-
ences, if any. Another concern of this study is to investigate
the strengths and weaknesses of these textbooks in present-
ing pragmatic content.
Literature Review
Whether or not to include pragmatic content in ELT text-
books has been a matter of controversy. On one hand,
Bardovi-Harlig (2001) states that textbooks cannot be con-
sidered as reliable sources of providing learners with prag-
matic input and the inclusion of pragmatic content in ELT
textbooks should be done with care as it requires analysis of
authentic language. On the other hand, many researchers are
of the opinion that pragmatic competence of L2 learners can
be improved through instructional materials such as text-
books (e.g., Crandall & Basturkmen, 2004; Rose, 2005).
Bouton (1994), for example, asserts that many pragmatic
aspects of L2 such as conversational implicature can be
learnt through instructional textbooks, and without them, the
process of learning will be slow or even impossible. Koike
and Pearson (2005) attribute another advantage in using
instructional textbooks in pragmatic instruction. They
believe that by using textbooks for instructing pragmatic
content, language learners will have a higher chance of
receiving feedback on linguistic features at pragmatic level.
According to Koike and Pearson (2005), pragmatic acquisi-
tion is facilitated to the extent L2 learners have the chance to
receive feedback on pragmatic issues. Given the importance
of pragmatic competence in the process of L2 learning and
considering the significant role that textbooks can play in
improving learners' pragmatic competence, it is of a great
importance to review the literature for the studies which
focused on the comparison among different ELT textbooks.
In an analysis of pragmatic content of ELT textbooks,
Vellenga (2004) indicated that generally "a phrase or two" is
concerned with pragmatic content in each page of common
ELT textbooks. She also showed that "the distribution of
speech act types across ESL and EFL textbooks did not
appear to be patterned, nor based on frequency of speech act
occurrence in natural language, and often seems counterin-
tuitive" (p. 9).
According to House (1996), while grammatical and lexi-
cal items were usually contextualized in the texts, pragmatic
content was always included in the textbooks in a de-contex-
tualized format. Diepenbroek and Derwing (2013) demon-
strated that textbooks tended to present pragmatic content in
isolation and this usually caused problems in the process of L2
learning for several reasons. First, the significance of pragmatic
competence in successful communication requires language
learners to select among different linguistic choices with regard
to the already taught pragmatic content. Consequently, de-con-
textualization usually leads to their difficulty in deciding the
appropriate form­function relationship in authentic commu-
nication. Nguyen's (2011) investigation could be a good
example for this matter. In her research on evaluating the
pragmatic content of the recently developed series of text-
books for Vietnamese upper-secondary schools, she found
that there was not a sound relationship between the speech
acts and their linguistic counterparts in these local textbooks.
The second reason is that de-contextualizing pragmatic con-
tent may lead to learners' inability to select an appropriate
speech act in a specific situation due to nuance differences
among different pragmatic structures (Cohen, 2005). Besides,
textbooks sometimes misrepresent or oversimplify the
appropriate pragmatic content in a particular situation
(Crandall & Basturkmen, 2004).
According to Sheldon (1988), "textbook is the visible
heart of any ELT program" (p. 237). As textbooks are vital
sources of L2 learning out of the classroom, their roles in
helping learners raise their pragmatic awareness becomes
more significant in EFL contexts. As a result, many investi-
gations have focused on ELT textbooks in EFL contexts.
In a research study, Nguyen (2011) surveyed pragmatic
topics such as advising and apologizing in EFL textbook
series. These topics were not included homogenously across
different levels of the textbooks. The findings of her study
also revealed that although the speech act of "opening a con-
versation" was included in all three levels of examined text-
books, the speech act of "closing a conversation" was not
given the attention it deserved. According to Nguyen, maybe
material developers consider conversation openers more
complex than conversation closers for L2 learners of English.
In another study, Ekin (2013) examined how the speech
act of suggestion was distributed in eight EFL course books.
The results of this investigation indicated that up to 70.8% of
strategies included in course books were about conventional-
ized forms. The findings further showed that suggestion
strategies included at the pre-intermediate level were more
than the ones included at the intermediate level.
Jiang (2006) conducted a study on the linguistic forms
used to perform the speech act of suggestion in both real-life
and ESL textbooks. She analyzed three recent and three old
ELT textbooks so as to compare the distribution of the speech
act of suggestion in the real-life language use and that of ELT
textbooks. The results of her investigation showed that even
though the new generation of textbooks included more struc-
tures regarding the speech act of suggestion, there was no
difference between the recent textbooks and the old ones in
terms of real-life use of this speech act. She concludes that it
is a necessity for ELT textbooks to include background infor-
mation about the structures of pragmatic content in real-life
context.
In a 4-month study done in Korea, Kim and Hall (2002)
investigated Korean children's participation in an intensive
reading program and its effects on their pragmatic compe-
tence. To gather the data, the researchers examined the num-
ber of words, utterances, and talk management features
Meihami and Khanlarzadeh 3
children used during some role-play sessions. The results of
their investigation showed that reading books in general and
intensive reading in particular could help learners develop
many aspects of L2 pragmatic competence. In conclusion,
they emphasized the significant role which ELT textbooks
play in providing EFL learners with the chance to acquaint
themselves with pragmatic content in the second language.
Due to the rising emphasis on the importance of L2 prag-
matic content in successful communication and as ELT text-
books are one of the influential means to provide learners
with linguistic features at pragmatic level, especially in EFL
contexts, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the
distribution of pragmatic content occurrence represented as
three speech acts of requesting, refusing, and apologizing in
global and local ELT textbooks. This study also aims to exam-
ine the strengths and weaknesses of elementary ELT text-
books in terms of their pragmatic content representation.
Research Questions
This study attempts to answer the following questions:
Research Question 1: How frequent are the speech acts
of requesting, refusing, and apologizing in global and
local elementary ELT textbooks?
Research Question 2: How frequent are the strategies
that can be used to perform the speech acts of requesting,
refusing, and apologizing in global elementary ELT
textbooks?
Research Question 3: How frequent are the strategies
that can be used to perform the speech acts of requesting,
refusing, and apologizing in a local elementary ELT
textbook?
Method
Corpus
The elementary level of three global ELT textbooks, includ-
ing Interchange by Richards (2005), Top Notch by Saslow
and Ascher (2006), and American English File by Oxenden,
Latham-Koeing, and Seligson (2008) along with the local
elementary textbooks of ILI Series (Panel of writers, 2010),
comprised the corpus of the present study. The elementary
level of these series, each, was composed of two or three
textbooks. It should be stated that the reliability of ILI ele-
mentary level has already been confirmed by a panel of
experts in material design field. ILI textbooks are called local
since a local panel of ELT experts design them on the base of
local needs and norms. Moreover, for the sake of consistency
and ease of analysis, the books comprising the elementary
level of a particular textbook were regarded as one elemen-
tary book. For instance, American English File Starter and
American English File One were combined together and
were considered one elementary book, namely, American
English File Elementary. Therefore, Interchange Intro and
Interchange 1, Top Notch 2A and 2B, and three ILI Series
Elementary textbooks were respectively regarded as
Interchange Elementary, Top Notch Elementary, and ILI
Series Elementary.
Data Analysis Framework
To analyze the distribution of three speech acts of requesting,
refusing, and apologizing, three frameworks were used. As
far as the frequency of the speech act of refusal was con-
cerned, Beebe, Takahashi, and Uliss-Weltz's (1990) frame-
work was used. In their framework, Beebe et al. (1990)
divided the speech act of refusal into two categories: direct
and indirect. They also divided each category into some
strategies. While a response to an utterance such as "I don't
think so!" is categorized as direct/non-performative refusal,
responding to the same utterance by "I feel terrible . . ." is
categorized as indirect/statement of regret. While there are
two subcategories for expressions of direct refusal, expres-
sions of indirect refusal consist of 11 subcategories (see
Appendix A).
To obtain the frequency of the request speech act in the
ELT textbooks, Blum-Kulka, House, and Kasper's (1989)
framework was adopted. Blum-Kulka et al. (1989) catego-
rized the request speech act into three strategies, including
direct strategies such as "Clean up the kitchen," convention-
ally indirect strategies such as "Could you clean up the
kitchen, please?" and non-conventionally indirect strategies
such as "You have left the kitchen in a right mess" (see
Appendix B).
To analyze the speech act of apologizing, a framework
devised by Olshtain and Cohen (1983) was used. In this
framework, the speech act of apologizing was divided into
five categories of expression of apology, "I am sorry"; expla-
nation or account of the situation, "the bus was late"; an
acknowledgment of responsibility, "It is my fault"; an offer
of repair, "I'll pay for the broken vase"; and promise of for-
bearance, "it won't happen again" (Appendix C).
Based on these three frameworks and by analyzing dia-
logue and conversation parts of the ELT textbooks, the fre-
quency of the speech acts as well as the main strategies used
for each of them were counted. Regarding the speech act of
refusal, whether it was (a) direct and/or (b) indirect, and for
the speech act of request, whether it was (a) direct, (b) con-
ventionally indirect, or (c) non-conventionally indirect were
specified. As far as the speech act of apology was concerned,
the researchers used Olshtain and Cohen's framework to see
to what category each act of apology could be attributed. The
four categories for the speech act of apology were (a) an
example of an apology, (b) an explanation or account of the
situation, (c) an acknowledgment of responsibility, and (d)
an offer of repair. The following extract taken from Unit 7 of
ILI Series (Elementary 1) is an example of direct request
based on Blum-Kulka et al.'s (1989) request framework:
4 SAGE Open
A: Waiter! I'd like the menu; please.
B: Here, You are, Sir.
The following extract taken from Unit 10 of Interchange
(Intro) is an example of direct refusal based on Beebe et al.'s
(1990) refusal framework:
A: You can sing really well.
B: Oh! Thanks . . . But you can, too.
A: Well, no. I can't sing at all--but I can play the piano.
The following extract taken from Unit 2 of Top Notch (2A) is
an example of expression of regret based on Olshtain and
Cohen's (1983) apology framework:
A: Sorry I am late. Have you been here long?
B: For about 10 minutes.
A: I am sorry. I got stuck in traffic.
Results
It is without saying that one of the problems existing in the
corpus-based studies is the subjectivity which involves in the
codification process. In this regard, the researchers conducted
an inter-coder reliability to be sure about the consistency of
the corpus analysis results. To do so, Krippendorff's Alpha
(KALPHA) was run. The result of the inter-coder reliability
indicated a high index of reliability (r = .82) which could be
tracked to the practices the researchers exercised on the
frameworks prior to the final data collection and analysis.
The first research question of this study was concerned
with the overall frequency of pragmatic content regarding
three speech acts of requesting, refusing, and apologizing in
global as well as local elementary ELT textbooks. Figure 1
shows the frequency of pragmatic content in four elementary
ELT textbooks.As seen below, while Interchange Elementary
has the highest frequency of pragmatic content (f = 75),
American English File has the lowest frequency of pragmatic
content (f = 20). Figure 1 also indicates that the local ILI
Series Elementary has a higher frequency of pragmatic con-
tent (f = 44) than Top Notch Elementary (f = 40) and American
English File.
The second question of this research study aimed to obtain
the frequency of three speech acts within global elementary
ELT textbooks. To this end, the frequency of each speech act
was calculated based on the specified frameworks.
Table 1 demonstrates the frequency of the three speech
acts in the conversation parts of the Interchange at elemen-
tary level. As is shown, while the speech acts of request and
refusal are used respectively 34 and 32 times, the speech act
of apology is only repeated nine times.
The frequency of the strategies used in each speech act
can also be seen in Figure 2 below. As it can be seen,
Interchange Elementary uses direct and indirect language
almost with the same frequency.
Table 2 indicates the frequency of three speech acts of
requesting, refusing, and apologizing for Top Notch
Elementary.As shown, the speech act of refusal has the high-
est frequency (f = 22) and the speech act of apology the low-
est one (f = 6). Contrary to other three ELT textbooks, Top
Notch Elementary has quite a low frequency with regard to
the speech act of request (f = 12).
Different strategies of each speech act were also obtained
by using the specified frameworks. As is shown in Figure 3,
Top Notch Elementary uses more direct speech acts than indi-
rect ones. While the most frequent strategy is direct refusal
(f = 13), the least frequent strategy is indirect request (f = 3).

Table 3 presents the speech acts used in American English
File Elementary. As indicated, the frequency of the speech
acts of refusal and apology are respectively four and one,
which suggest, unlike the other global textbooks, American
English File does not give much attention to these two speech
acts at elementary level.
The frequency of the strategies used for each of these
speech acts is also presented in Figure 4. In comparison with
Top Notch Elementary that only used three indirect requests,
American English File Elementary used more indirect
requests in its conversations (f = 8).
The third question of this investigation was concerned
with the frequency of pragmatic content represented in the
speech acts of requesting, refusing, and apologizing in local
ELT textbooks. For this purpose, ILI Series Elementary was
analyzed based on the frameworks discussed above. Table 4
illustrates that, similar to Interchange Elementary and
American English File Elementary, ILI Series Elementary
has also emphasized on the speech act of request with a
higher frequency (f = 22) than refusal (f = 17) and apology
(f = 5) at elementary level.
The strategies used for the three speech acts in ILI Series
Elementary are shown in Figure 5 below. One thing that
catches one's attention is the high frequency of direct request
(f = 20) and the low frequency of indirect request (f = 2).
One more thing worth mentioning is that, concerning the
strategies used for the three speech acts, none of the global
and local textbooks include any of the following strategies:
non-conventionally indirect refusal for the speech act of
refusal, and an explanation for the situation, an acknowledg-
ment of responsibility, and an offer of repair for the speech
act of apology.
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that it is quite difficult
to find a clear-cut pattern both across and within the global
and local textbooks with regard to the inclusion of pragmatic
content. As far as the frequency of the speech acts across the
textbooks is concerned, except for Top Notch Elementary,
which makes use of the speech act of refusal more than the
speech act of request, request speech act has the highest fre-
quency in the ELT textbooks. Given the inherent difficulty
and the requirement of this speech act for a lot of "face-
work" within different social contexts (Blum-Kulka et al.,
1989), and considering the fact that the speech act of request
is quite burdensome for elementary learners compared with
advanced ones (Carrell & Konnecker, 1981; Walters, 1980),
it is justified why these elementary ELT textbooks focus on
this speech act with a high frequency. Compared with the
low frequency of apology, the speech act of refusal also
enjoyed a relatively high frequency in the ELT textbooks.
This may be because of the face-threatening nature of this
speech act. According to Ellis (2008), refusal speech act is
usually used in response to a variety of illocutionary acts
including invitations, offers, and requests. What makes this
speech act even trickier is how the status of the interlocutors
affects its appropriate use (Beebe & Takahashi, 1989).
Consequently, like the speech act of request, L2 learners
need to encounter a lot of refusal tasks in the dialogue and
conversation parts of their textbooks so as to perform this
speech act in various social contexts with interlocutors who
have different power status.
Except for American English File Elementary that fails to
emphasize the importance of this speech act, the other text-
books show a good frequency with regard to it. Nevertheless,
according to the results of this study, both global and local

textbooks fail to present the speech act of apology suffi-
ciently and appropriately. Not only do they fail to include a
sufficient number of apology speech acts, they also disregard
the various strategies through which this speech act can be
performed. Since different cultures may realize apology in
different ways, poor attention within the textbooks may put
L2 learners in trouble in the production and comprehension
of apology. This should therefore be regarded as a weakness
for the four textbooks. Others also believe low frequency
occurrence of the speech act of apology in ELT textbooks
usually lead to EFL learners' difficulty in the appropriate use
of it (Felix-Brasdefer, 2004; Gass & Houck, 1999).
Concerning the strategies used for each of the speech acts,
although all the four textbooks only emphasized on the strat-
egy of an example of an apology for the speech act of apol-
ogy and disregarded an explanation or account of the
situation, an acknowledgment of responsibility, and an offer
of repair, with respect to directness and indirectness of the
speech acts of request and refusal, no consistency was found
both within and across the textbooks. These inconsistencies
were also observed in other similar studies (Alemi, Roodi, &
Bemani, 2013; Diepenbroek & Derwing, 2013). Diepenbroek
and Derwing (2013) concluded that ELT textbooks usually
failed to represent different options which students had to
obey to perform a function. Owing to this, language instruc-
tors need to complement their textbooks with some authentic
extracts; consequently, the students can have access to a
better representation of the speech acts for the focus of a par-
ticular session.
One reason for these discrepancies may lie in material
developers' attitudes toward the role of ELT textbooks in L2
learning programs. On one hand, those who take Sheldon's
(1988) view that ELT textbook is one of the most important
elements for successful language programs believe that
effective ELT textbooks should cover all aspects of L2
including pragmatic content. In this view, as classrooms are
thought to be an optimal place to equip language learners
with pragmatic knowledge for future encounters (Koester,
2002), ELT textbooks should provide teachers with neces-
sary examples of linguistic features at pragmatic level so as
to help them optimize learners' opportunities to promote
their pragmatic competence. Naturally, material developers
who share this viewpoint tend to include more features of
pragmatic content in their textbooks. On the other hand,
some such as Bardovi-Harlig (2001) argue that ELT text-
books should not be considered as reliable sources of prag-
matic content in the classroom and cast doubt on the
effectiveness of presenting learners with pragmatic content
in ELT textbooks. Those who take Bardivi-Harlig's view
may focus more on linguistic features at syntactic and seman-
tic levels, and more or less let the pragmatic aspects of L2
learning be automatically taken care of. Nevertheless, some-
times, especially in EFL contexts, ELT textbooks are the
only means for providing learners with pragmatic content
(Brock & Nagasaka, 2005).
The findings of the present study, with regard to strengths
and weaknesses of global and local ELT textbooks, further
suggest that, if we consider the frequency of pragmatic con-
tent as an indication of the efficiency of the textbooks at
pragmatic level, Interchange Elementary is in a better posi-
tion concerning the inclusion and distribution of pragmatic
content represented as three speech acts of request, refusal,

and apology, at least at the elementary level. Interestingly, in
this regard, the other two global textbooks, namely, American
English File Elementary and Top Notch Elementary, can be
considered unsatisfying compared with the local ILI Series
Elementary. One shortcoming of ILI Series Elementary,
though, is that it overrates the strategy of direct request
(f = 20), and has the lowest frequency with regard to indirect
request (f = 2) among all the textbooks. Although research
has shown that low proficient L2 learners tend to use more
direct speech acts than indirect ones that are more frequently
used by high proficient L2 learners (Ervin-Tripp, Strage,
Lampert, & Bell, 1987; Faerch & Kasper, 1989; Hill, 1997),
it is still not justified not to present elementary students with
enough indirect speech acts.
Conclusion
The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of
pragmatic content occurrence represented as three speech
acts of requesting, refusing, and apologizing in global as well

as local ELT textbooks. To this end, three global elementary
ELT textbooks including Interchange, Top Notch, and
American English File, as well as the local elementary text-
books of ILI Series, were analyzed through three frameworks
specifically designed for each of the speech acts. Based on
the results of the study, although a few discrepancies have
been found in the frequency of speech acts and the strategies
used to perform them both within and across the global and
local ELT textbooks, they also share many strengths and
weaknesses regarding their coverage and distribution of
pragmatic content. The findings of this study demonstrated
the discrepancies existing among different ELT textbooks
with regard to pragmatic content, thus the findings is along
with that of Diepenbroek and Derwing (2013). The findings
of the current study supported the hypothesis that ELT text-
books, both global and local ones, suffered from a pattern to
include pragmatic content (Vellenga, 2004).
The present study suffered from a few limitations that
should be taken into account when further research is
designed. First, as this study only examined ELT textbooks at
elementary level, it is not clear whether the strategies that
were missing in elementary textbooks are included in higher
levels or not. Further study is therefore necessary to examine
the distribution of strategies for the three speech acts in inter-
mediate as well as advanced ELT textbooks. Moreover, in
this study, pragmatic content was examined only with regard
to speech acts of requesting, refusing, and apologizing.
Future studies can investigate the patterns of frequency for
other speech acts.
The implications of this study are twofold. One implica-
tion is that as one of the most efficient ways of acquiring
pragmatic competence in EFL/ESL contexts is through using
ELT textbooks in the classrooms, it is of paramount impor-
tance for material developers to include different speech acts
along with various strategies through which they can be per-
formed so as to help L2 learners in promoting their prag-
matic competence. The other implication of the present study
is for language instructors. As discussed above, not all the
speech acts and their strategies are sufficiently frequent and
appropriately distributed in ELT textbooks. Therefore, it is
the job of language teachers to fill these gaps whenever nec-
essary, especially in EFL contexts where there is not enough
exposure to linguistic features at pragmatic level.
