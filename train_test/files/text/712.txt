Class And Benefits At The
Workplace
Low-wage workers in search of health benefits are most likely to find them
in companies with many well-paid employees.
by Jon Gabel, Kimberly Hurst, Heidi Whitmore, and
Catherine Hoffman
Two powerful economic forces are
transforming the lives of U.S. workers:
the globalization of the U.S. economy
and the information revolution. Simultane-
ously, these forces are improving the standard
of living for college graduates while depress-
ing inflation-adjusted wages for Americans
with a high school education or less. Since
1973 real hourly wages for high school gradu-
ates have fallen 11 percent, and those of school
dropouts have fallen 18 percent. College
graduates, on the other hand, have enjoyed a
17 percent increase in hourly wages.1
Contributing to the growing disparity in
the standard of living among workers, job-
based health coverage also has deteriorated
over the past two decades for less educated
populations. As the source of health insurance
for 152 million workers and their dependents,
job-based insurance is closely linked to
wages, since dollars spent on health insurance
coverage represent an alternative form of
compensation.2 During the past six years the
U.S. economy added more than twelve million
jobs, and the unemployment rate fell to the
lowest level since 1969.3 Yet, concurrently, the
number of uninsured persons in the United
States increased from thirty-five million to
forty-three million. In 1997, a year in which
the unemployment rate fell from 5.3 percent
to 4.6 percent, the number of uninsured per-
sons increased by nearly two million.4
The same forces that have redistributed
earnings to more highly educated members of
the workforce also are curtailing health cover-
age for less educated workers. Among Ameri-
cans living in a family whose head of house-
hold has a high school diploma or less, the
percentage of the population without health
insurance grew from 26.2 percent in 1992 to
28.6 percent in 1997. In contrast, among per-
sons from families whose head of household
holds a college degree, the percentage without
health insurance nudged up only slightly,
from 7.8 percent to 8.1 percent.5
Household surveys such as the Current
Population Survey have established the close
relationship between family earnings and
health coverage. In 1997 one-quarter of per-
sons from families with annual incomes of less
than $25,000 were uninsured. Only 8 percent
of persons from families with incomes above
$75,000 were without health insurance cover-
age.6 Yet a firm's decision to offer coverage is
not made one worker at a time, but is based on
the collective characteristics of its workforce.

In this paper we examine how differences
in the composition of a firm's workforce affect
the characteristics of the health benefits of-
fered. Other researchers have found that the
earnings of a small firm's workforce strongly
affect the likelihood that the firm will offer
health benefits.7 This is the first paper, to our
knowledge, that shows how the distribution
of wages within a firm's workforce affects
coverage, benefits, cost sharing, costs, and
plan offerings for firms that provide coverage.
Data are from KPMG Peat Marwick's 1998
survey of employers about job-based health
insurance. The sample includes 2,763 public
and private firms with three or more workers.
In conducting the survey, KPMG asked ques-
tions for the first time about the compensa-
tion of the responding firms' workers--with
the critical question being the percentage of
each firm's workers earning less than $20,000
and more than $75,000 a year.8
STUDY METHODS
Study data are from a national survey of em-
ployers administered in two phases. In the
first phase, January­March 1998, National Re-
search Inc. (NRI) conducted telephone inter-
views with employee benefit managers for the
KPMG 1998 Annual Survey of Employer-
Based Health Plans. This survey yielded a
sample of 1,583 firms with 200 or more work-
ers. In the second phase the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation funded KPMG to admin-
ister a survey of small employers. NRI con-
ducted telephone interviews with employee
benefit managers in the summer of 1998, com-
pleting interviews with 1,180 employers hav-
ing fewer than 200 workers.
The sample design and questionnaire for
the two surveys are nearly identical. KPMG
drew its sample from a Dun and Bradstreet
listing of U.S. private and public employers.
To increase precision, KPMG stratified the
sample by industry, region, and firm size. We
replaced any firm that declined to participate
in the survey with another randomly selected
firm from the same sampling cell. The re-
sponse rate for the survey of larger firms was
52 percent; for the survey of smaller firms, it
was 51 percent.
Because firms are randomly selected, it is
possible through the use of statistical weights
to extrapolate sample findings to national, re-
gional, industry, firm-size, and other averages.
These weights allow us to present findings in
terms of the situation for a typical firm and a
typical employee.
Our hypothesis was that the distribution
of wages within a firm's workforce greatly in-
fluenced the employer's health benefit offer-
ings. We used two measures of the distribu-
tion of wages--the percentage of workers
who earned more than $75,000 per year and
who earned less than $20,000 per year--and
defined nine groups of firms (Exhibit 1).
To improve the clarity of the analysis, we

then collapsed the nine groups to five.9 (1)
"Low-wage" firms were employers with few
high-wage workers and many low-wage
workers.10 These firms were disproportion-
ately from the South and from the retail and
wholesale sectors. They generally employed
fewer than 200 workers. (2) "Low/high-
wage" firms were employers with many low-
wage and either moderate numbers of or many
high-wage workers. These firms often were
from the West and the finance sector. They
generally employed fifty to 5,000 workers. (3)
"Middle-income" firms had moderate num-
bers of low-wage workers and few or moder-
ate numbers of high-wage workers. These
firms were disproportionately from the South
and Midwest and from the state and local gov-
ernment sector. They generally employed fifty
to 999 workers. (4) "Egalitarian" firms had
few low-wage workers and few or moderate
numbers of high-wage workers. These firms
were likely to be from the Midwest and East
and from the manufacturing sector. They em-
ployed twenty-five to forty-nine or 5,000 or
more workers. (5) "High-wage" firms em-
ployed many high-wage workers and few or
moderate numbers of low-wage workers.
These firms were disproportionately from the
East and from the finance sector. They tended
to employ more than 5,000 workers.11
FINDINGS
n COVERAGE. The wage distribution of a
small firm's workforce strongly influences
whether the firm will offer health benefits to
its workers.12 Higher-wage firms are more
likely than lower-wage firms are to provide
health coverage for their workforce (Exhibit
2). Only 39 percent of the small firms (fewer
than 200 workers) in the low-wage group of-
fered health benefits to their workers. In con-
trast, among the high-wage firms, 82 percent
of small firms offered health benefits.
Among firms of all sizes that offered health
benefits, the wage distribution of the work-
force was significantly associated with the
"coverage rate," the percentage of the work-
force covered by the firm's health benefits. For
low-wage firms this rate was 52 percent, com-
pared with 62 percent for low/high-wage
firms and 78 percent for high-wage firms.
The coverage rate is determined by multi-
plying the percentage of workers eligible for
coverage (the eligibility rate) by the percent-

age of eligibles who elect coverage (the take-
up rate). High-wage firms had the highest
percentage of workers eligible for coverage
and of workers electing coverage. In contrast,
low-wage firms had the second-lowest per-
centage of workers eligible for coverage and
the lowest percentage of eligible workers
electing coverage.
Eligibility criteria for part-time workers
tend to be more stringent at lower-wage firms
(Exhibit 3).13 Whereas 56 percent of part-time
workers in high-wage firms and 50 percent of
part-time workers in egalitarian firms were
eligible for health benefits, only 29 percent of
those in low-wage firms were eligible. De-
pendent coverage varies little across wage-
defined employer groups. Surprisingly, the
two groups most likely to provide coverage
for nontraditional partners--same-sex or het-
erosexual unmarried partners--were low-
wage and high-wage firms.
n PLAN OFFERINGS AND CHOICE. The
percentage of workers who may choose a con-
ventional health plan or a health maintenance
organization (HMO) varies little by wage
group (Exhibit 4). Employees at high-wage
firms were more likely to have a choice of hy-
brid-type managed care plans such as pre-
ferred provider organizations (PPOs) and
point-of-service (POS) plans. The median
number of plans offered to employees also var-
ied little by wage-defined group.
For all wage-defined groups, managed care
plans accounted for at least 77 percent of en-
rollment.14 Enrollment in HMOs was greatest
in low-wage and low/high-wage firms (Ex-
hibit 4). High-wage workers were more heav-
ily enrolled in PPOs and POS plans and, sur-
prisingly, least likely to enroll in conventional
plans.
n EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION AND
COVERAGE. During this decade the number
of uninsured persons has risen, not because
fewer firms are offering health benefits, but
largely because more workers have declined
coverage.15 While real wages declined for low-
wage workers, nominal employee contribu-
tions for single and family coverage rose more
than threefold from 1988 to 1996.16
Workers in low-wage firms contributed
24 percent of the monthly cost for single cov-
erage and 41 percent of the cost for family
coverage (Exhibit 5). In contrast, employees
at high-wage firms pay 21 percent of the cost
of single and 27 percent of the cost of family
coverage. For family coverage, the share of
premium paid by workers declines as we
move from low- to high-wage firms.
n COST OF COVERAGE. The overall cost
of single and family coverage is closely related
to wage group (Exhibit 5). The average
monthly cost for single coverage is $162 for
low-wage firms, $173 for low/high-wage
firms, and $189 for high-wage firms. For fam-
ily coverage, costs rise continuously as one
moves from low- to high-wage firms, with a

low of $413 for low-wage firms and a high of
$499 for high-wage firms. Low-wage firms are
more price-sensitive than high-wage firms
are. When asked what factors were important
in their selection of health plans, 80 percent of
low-wage firms indicated that the cost of the
plan was "very important," compared with
only 56 percent of high-wage firms.
Differences in premiums largely reflect dis-
parities in cost sharing and covered benefits
among firms.17 Deductibles for single coverage
in conventional plans averaged $293 among
low-wage firms, $269 among low/high-wage
firms, and $209 among high-wage firms. Simi-
larly, the average deductible for using in-
network providers in PPO plans was $228 in

low-wage firms and $140 in high-wage firms.
For POS plans, the in-network deductibles of
$73 for low-wage firms were more than dou-
ble those for high-wage firms.
n RETIREE BENEFITS. High-wage firms
were most likely to provide retiree health
benefits to their workers (Exhibit 6). Seventy-
six percent of workers in high-wage firms
were offered retiree health benefits, compared
with 48 percent of workers in low-wage firms
and 50 percent in low/high-wage firms. As we
move from low- to high-wage groups, a grow-
ing percentage of workers are employed by a
firm offering retiree health benefits.
n FLEXIBLE BENEFITS. Flexible benefits
allow employees to pay for any health insur-
ance contributions, as well as other employee
benefits, with pretax earnings. Another ap-
pealing aspect of flexible-spending accounts
is that employees may use pretax dollars to
pay their cost-sharing obligations, such as de-
ductibles, coinsurance, and physician charges
in excess of the insurance payment. Higher-
wage firms were more likely than lower-wage
firms were to provide flexible-spending ac-
counts (Exhibit 6). Fifty-five percent of em-
ployees in low-wage firms were offered a flex-
ible-spending plan. In contrast, 81 percent of
workers in egalitarian and high-wage firms
were offered such a plan.
Aworker's health insurance clearly
is influenced by the wages of other em-
ployees in the firm. Since health bene-
fits represent an alternative form of compen-
sation, the surprise is not the presence but the
recurring pattern of the relationship between
the wages of a firm's workforce and the firm's
health benefits.
Reflecting on the failure to pass the Clin-
ton administration's Health Security Act,
Walter Zelman, a key administration adviser,
observed the following:
[W]e kept trying to link middle-class concerns
to lower-income concerns, knowing that we
had an opportunity to piggyback the universal
coverage issue onto middle-class insecurities
regarding thepotential loss ofhealth insurance.18
What is apparent from our study is the
divergent interests of workers in firms with
concentrations of low- and high-wage work-
ers. The current system of employer-
sponsored health insurance, when combined
with the tax exclusion of employer contribu-
tions for health benefits, contributes to the
class system of health care coverage in the
United States.19 Workers from high-wage
firms will be made worse off by reforms of a
system that equalizes the tax subsidy for
health insurance.20 However, it is in the inter-
est of the uninsured and workers from low-
wage and low/high-wage firms to equalize the
tax subsidy across the population.
Our findings strongly suggest that low-
wage families obtain some protection against
becoming uninsured if they find work in firms
where a substantial share of the employees
earn more than they do. In the next decade,
however, the globalization of the U.S. econ-

omy and the information revolution are likely
to further exacerbate wage disparities be-
tween college-educated and less educated
Americans. If these forces also increasingly
segregate low- and high-wage workers into
different firms, then the net effect will be to
further widen the gap in health coverage be-
tween low-wage families and other Americans.

8. The question did not distinguish earnings for
full- and part-time workers. Hence, firms hiring
substantial percentages of part-time workers are
more likely to report higher percentages of
workers earning less than $20,000 per year.
9. In reducing the number of groups from nine to
five, we attempted to have a minimum of 200
firms within each group. When combining cells,
we grouped cells with similar income composi-
tion. The basis of pooling groups was inspection
of descriptive statistics on each of the nine origi-
nal groups.
10. "Few high-wage workers" refers to firms in
which 5 percent of workers earned $75,000 or
more annually; "an average number of high-wage
workers" means that more than 5 percent and
fewer than 20 percent earned $75,000 or more;
and "many high-wage workers" means that more
than 20 percent earned $75,000 per year.
In the subsequent discussion, "few low-wage
workers" means that 10 percent or less of em-
ployees earned less than $20,000 per year; "mod-
erate numbers of low-wage workers" means that
10.01­29. 99 percent earned less than $20,000 per
year; and "many low-wage workers" means that
30 percent or more of workers earned less than
$20,000 per year.
11. About 34 percent of large and 6 percent of small
firms could not provide us with complete infor-
mation on the earnings distribution of the work-
force; consequently, they are not included in the
subsequent analysis.
12. In its annual survey of large employers, KPMG
screens out firms not offering health benefits. In
fact, an estimated 99 percent of firms with 200 or
more workers offer health benefits to their work-
force.
13. The definition of part-time workers was left to the
discretion of each responding firm.
