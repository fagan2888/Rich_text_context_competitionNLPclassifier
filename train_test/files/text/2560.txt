Abstract
BACKGROUND
Maternal labor force participation has increased dramatically over the last 40 years, yet
surprisingly little is known about longitudinal patterns of maternal labor force
participation in the years after a birth, or how these patterns vary by education.
OBJECTIVE
We document variation by maternal education in mothers' labor force participation
(timing, intensity, non-standard work, multiple job-holding) over the first nine years
after the birth of a child.
METHODS
We use the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N~3000) to predict
longitudinal labor force participation in a recent longitudinal sample of mothers who
gave birth in large US cities between 1998 and 2000. Families were followed until
children were age 9, through 2010.
RESULTS
Labor force participation gradually increases in the years after birth for mothers with
high school or less education, whereas for mothers with some college or more,
participation increases between ages 1 and 3 and then remains mostly stable thereafter.
Mothers with less than high school education have the highest rates of unemployment
(actively seeking work), which remain high compared with all other education groups,
whose unemployment declines over time. Compared with all other education groups,
mothers with some college have the highest rates of labor force participation, but also
high rates of part-time employment, non-standard work, and multiple job-holding.

CONTRIBUTION
Simple conceptualizations of labor force participation do not fully capture the dynamics
of labor force attachment for mothers in terms of intensity, timing of entry, and type of
work hours, as well as differences by maternal education.
1. Introduction
Maternal employment in the U.S. has increased dramatically over the last 40 years.
Among mothers with children under 18, 47% were in the labor force in 1975 and this
figure increased to more than 70% in the late 1990s, where it has remained over the last
15 years (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2009, 2014). Maternal labor force participation,
employment intensity, and type of participation (non-standard work, multiple job-
holding) are not only linked with economic wellbeing, but also with parenting, child
care, and the home environment, all of which impact the wellbeing of families. Despite
these changes in maternal labor force participation in recent decades, surprisingly few
studies have investigated participation using longitudinal data. This is an important
oversight as studying the continuity, intensity, and type of participation mothers engage
in over time is key to understanding how and whether maternal labor force participation
is linked with family wellbeing. In this descriptive report we describe maternal labor
force participation (employment, unemployment, out of labor force), intensity (part- vs.
full-time) and type (nonstandard, multiple job-holding), in the first nine years after
giving birth.
A second aim of this paper is to describe variation in maternal labor force
participation in the years after a birth by maternal education. We do this for a few
reasons. Changes in U.S. social policies in the late 1990s led to a greater increase in
maternal employment among the least advantaged groups (Coley et al. 2007). Research
has also documented the phenomenon of "diverging destinies", whereby the families in
which children are being raised are increasingly diverging in terms of key inputs such
as time, quality, and money for child health and development by maternal education
(McLanahan 2004) and, more generally, there are huge disparities in economic
resources that children receive by parents' education levels (Putnam 2015). To shed
light on these potential disparities, we study whether the levels, timing, and intensity of
maternal labor force participation over time vary by maternal education.
A handful of studies have examined women's labor force participation
longitudinally and have found that women make numerous entries into and exits from
the labor force (or employment) over the life course (Hynes and Clarkberg 2005; Moen
1985; Vandenheuvel 1997). These entries and exits have important implications for
Demographic Research: Volume 34, Article 14
http://www.demographic-research.org 409
thinking about long-term earnings potential, overall economic wellbeing, and ultimately
the wellbeing of families. The current study builds on these earlier studies by examining
maternal labor force participation in a contemporary cohort of mothers ­ those who had
children between 1998 and 2000, shortly after major welfare reforms in the U.S. and
just after maternal labor force participation rates leveled out.
2. Data and methods
2.1 Data
We use longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study
(FFCWS; N~3000), a representative study of births to mothers in large US cities (with
populations over 200,000) between 1998 and 2000. These data are ideal for studying
recent maternal labor force participation patterns as the data were collected at the time
of the birth and again when the child was aged 1 (1999-2001), 3 (2001-2003), 5
(2003-2006), and 9 years (2007-2010). Moreover, from the vantage point of the child,
they represent the mother's employment patterns during the first decade of that child's
life. The FFCWS included approximately 5,000 births, drawing a random sample from
75 hospitals in 20 large US cities. The study oversampled non-marital births (at a ratio
of 3 non-marital to 1 marital birth), resulting in a racially diverse, somewhat
economically disadvantaged sample; however, the sample was designed so that when
the data are weighted they are representative of mothers who gave birth in the late
1990s in large U.S. cities. The weights also adjust for non-response and attrition.
Because we are looking at patterns over time we restrict our sample to include mothers
who are in all survey waves, N=2,986 (the substantive findings are very similar when
the analyses are not restricted to mothers who are in all survey waves; analyses
available upon request).
The 9-year follow-up of the FFCWS occurred from 2007-2010. This is significant
because the Great Recession began in the U.S. in December 2007 and ended in June
2009 (as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research). As a result, many of
the mothers of the 9-year-olds surveyed were interviewed during the Great Recession,
which may have affected their labor force participation. Thus, although the results
reflect a contemporary birth cohort, they may not reflect typical circumstances faced by
urban mothers with 9-year-old children.

2.2 Measures
Our key variable of interest is maternal labor force participation and we construct
measures at each survey wave. We examine two variables, labor force participation and
employment. Following the Bureau of Labor Statistics, mothers are considered to be in
the labor force if they report that they are currently employed or if they are looking for
work (unemployed), otherwise mothers are considered out of the labor force. Mothers
are asked "Last week, did you do any regular work for pay?" and if they report working
or being on vacation they are considered employed. Mothers who are not working are
asked if they are looking for work, and, if they are, they are considered unemployed. To
investigate the intensity of labor force participation, we separate mothers who are
employed full-time (defined as working 30 hours or more per week) from those
employed part-time (less than 30 hours a week).
We also study maternal non-standard work hours and multiple job-holding. We
construct a measure of any non-standard work if mothers report working evenings,
nights, weekends, or shifting schedules (following Dunifon et al. 2013). Multiple job-
holding is coded as 1 if mothers report working more than one job at the same time.
In all our analyses we investigate differences in maternal labor force participation
by mother's education, which is coded as less than high school, high school, some
college, and college or higher. Twenty-four percent of mothers in our sample have less
than a high school education, 32% have a high school degree, 21% some college, and
24% a college degree or greater.
We include a number of demographic characteristics that have been linked in prior
research with maternal labor force participation as control measures in our analyses.
Specifically, we include race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black,
Hispanic, other race/ethnicity), maternal age at the birth, whether she was foreign-born,
and time-varying measures of relationship status (married, cohabiting, single) and the
number of children in the household (to account for birth order and subsequent births).
Table 1 documents the demographic make-up of the sample by maternal education.

2.3 Method
Multivariate models, controlling for the demographic characteristics specified above,
are run and used to predict labor force participation rates by education level at each
survey wave. All analyses are weighted using national weights, which adjust for
attrition and sample design (to account for the oversample of non-marital births) and to
provide estimates that are representative of mothers in large US cities. Our goal is to
describe variation in the patterns of mothers' labor force participation post-birth as a
function of several key characteristics associated with maternal employment. By
controlling for a number of demographic factors that might be confounded with
maternal education we can observe how labor force participation patterns vary by
education, net of a number of key demographic characteristics, to better ensure that the
variation we observe is largely driven by education as opposed to, say, the birth of a
new child or race/ethnic differences in education and employment.

3. Results
3.1 Patterns of labor force participation
Figure 1 plots predicted labor force participation among urban mothers after the birth of
a child by the child's age and by maternal education level, controlling for maternal
characteristics (race/ethnicity, age, nativity, relationship status, and number of children
in the household). Looking across the four panels, we see that labor force participation
rates vary greatly by maternal education. Participation rates are highest for mothers
with some college education, followed by college-educated mothers, then high-school-
educated mothers, and finally mothers with less than a high school degree, who have
the lowest participation rates. Although on average labor force participation increases
over time, the timing of the increase and even the overall trend varies by maternal
education.
Figure 1: Labor force participation by child's age and by maternal education
Note: PT= Part-time, FT= Full-time. All figures are predicted percentages, adjusted by the number of children in the household,
maternal relationship status, maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, and immigrant status. All analyses are weighted using
national weights. The sample is restricted to mothers who were interviewed in all survey waves, N=2986.
Starting with mothers with less than high school (Panel A), a sharp increase in full-
time employment occurs from age 1 to 3, accompanied by a sharp decline in part-time
employment (and level rates of labor force participation and unemployment). Full-time
Demographic Research: Volume 34, Article 14
http://www.demographic-research.org 413
employment continues to increase through age 5. At age 9, possibly as a result of the
Great Recession, mothers with less than high school are more likely to be employed
part-time, and less likely to be working full-time, whereas unemployment remains high
and relatively level over the whole time period for this group (about 25%).
For mothers with a high school education (Panel B), the pattern is quite different.
Mothers' overall participation in the labor force increases over time, but unlike mothers
with less than high school, full-time employment in this group increases from ages 1 to
3 to 5, and remains steady through age 9, but part-time employment, which remains
steady from ages 1 to 5, also increases at age 9 (possibly due to the Great Recession, if
more mothers would have otherwise chosen full-time employment). Unemployment
declines sharply from ages 1 to 3 and then remains steady at 15% for high-school-
educated mothers (11 percentage points lower than that of mothers with less than high
school). Thus, over time, mothers with a high school degree are more likely to enter the
labor force, and, among those in the labor force, more are employed.
Panel C documents the trends in labor force participation for mothers with some
college education and Panel D shows the trends for college-educated mothers. At first
glance, the patterns for mothers with some college and college education are relatively
similar. Both sets of mothers experience a bump up in full-time employment from ages
1 to 3 and then a decline from ages 3 to 5 that remains level through age 9. Rates of
unemployment are generally declining for both groups over time. College-educated
mothers experience a large decrease in unemployment from 3 to 5; however, much of
this decline occurs because college-educated mothers are moving out of the labor force
(an increase of 13 percentage points), whereas far fewer mothers with some college exit
the labor force (an increase of 4 percentage points). Patterns in part-time employment
also vary across the two groups. Fifteen percent of mothers with some college work
part-time at each year, whereas for college-educated mothers, levels of part-time work
are lower and there is a decline in part-time work from ages 1 to 3 and an increase at
age 9 (possibly due to the Great Recession).
3.2 Non-standard employment and multiple-job holding
In Figure 2 we document the predicted percentage of mothers working any non-
standard hours by child's age and mother's education among mothers who are
employed. We see that over time there is a general decline in the percentage of mothers
who are working non-standard work hours, but that the decline is steepest for college-
educated mothers: whereas 60% of employed college-educated mothers work some
non-standard hours at age 1, by age 9 only 21% do likewise. In comparison, for all
other groups there is a decline from ages 1 to 3 but then a relative leveling off, and for
Pilkauskas, Waldfogel & Brooks-Gunn: Maternal labor force participation in an urban birth cohort
414 http://www.demographic-research.org
employed mothers with some college, 56% are working non-standard work schedules at
age 9, more than twice the percentage of college-educated mothers.
Figure 2: Non-standard work by child's age and maternal education, among
employed mothers
Note: All figures are predicted percentages, adjusted by the number of children in the household, maternal relationship status,
maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, and immigrant status. All analyses are weighted using national weights. The sample is
restricted to mothers who were interviewed in all survey waves, N=2986.
In Figure 3 we document predicted multiple-job holding among mothers who are
employed. Here we see a general pattern that shows an increase in multiple-job holding
over time from about age 1 to 5 and then a decline at age 9. These patterns are relatively
similar across education groups, but the levels are quite different. Mothers with some
college education have the highest rates of multiple-job holding, whereas college-
educated mothers generally have the lowest rates.

4. Conclusion
Using recent longitudinal data, this paper examines mothers' labor force participation
from when their child was age 1 through age 9 and is the first to study variation in the
patterns of participation among mothers over time to examine whether the specific
timing of their labor force entry and intensity of employment varied by maternal
education. Our study builds on previous studies of maternal labor force participation to
show that the timing and intensity of labor force participation varies considerably by
maternal education level. Mothers with high school or less education increase their
labor force participation gradually over time, moving toward full-time work as their
children age. By comparison, mothers with some college education or more have a
bump up in participation (and intensity) at age 3, but overall have flatter labor force
participation over time.
Mothers with less than a high school degree have the weakest labor force
attachment; these mothers have the lowest rates of full-time work, the highest rates of
being out of the labor force, and the highest rates of unemployment, which remain high

over time; whereas for all other education groups, unemployment declines as children
age. We also see that at age 9, when the Great Recession hit, mothers with less than
high school have a 10-percentage point decline in full-time work and a small increase in
part-time work, which does not occur for mothers in the other groups (although there is
an increase in part-time work for both high school and college-educated mothers,
possibly due to the Great Recession). This finding is consistent with work that has
shown that the recession hit less-educated populations hardest (Hoynes, Miller, and
Schaller 2012), especially those individuals at the very bottom of the income
distribution (Sum and Khatiwada 2010), and suggests that disparities in employment by
education level persist over time.
Surprisingly, we found that mothers with some college education had the highest
predicted rates of labor force participation, even higher than college-educated mothers.
Additional analyses, however, indicated that mothers with some college education were
more likely to work part-time, work non-standard hours, and hold multiple jobs than
college-educated mothers. Thus, although overall labor force participation and
employment rates may be higher than that of college-educated mothers, the quality of
employment (nonstandard work, multiple job-holding) is likely lower for mothers with
some college.
This study has a few limitations. First, as noted earlier, it is likely that the Great
Recession affects our findings for age 9. Although our descriptive findings do not
suggest higher unemployment rates in the age 9 analyses than in earlier waves, it is
likely that had there been no recession the unemployment rates would have been lower
and more mothers would have entered the labor force. Nonetheless, we are describing
labor force participation patterns in a recent cohort of mothers ­ those that faced the
Great Recession. Second, the findings here are limited to mothers in large US cities
with young children, and are specific to a cohort of women who gave birth between
1998 and 2000. Labor force participation rates in the FFCWS study are higher than
national estimates when the children are young, but converge with national estimates as
the children age. Third, the periodicity of the panel means we are missing periods of
employment. Finally, attrition may affect our findings. Although the weights adjust for
non-response and attrition, we know that mothers who attrite are more economically
disadvantaged and slightly more likely to be unemployed than those who do not leave
the sample. Thus, to the extent that the weights do not fully account for attrition, our
estimates may misstate employment and labor force participation levels over time.
In spite of these limitations, our study offers some important lessons. Our findings
suggest that simple conceptualizations of labor force participation do not fully capture
the dynamics of labor force attachment for mothers in terms of intensity, timing of
entry, and type of work hours. They also suggest that disparities by maternal education
in employment and labor force participation persist over time, supporting the concept of
Demographic Research: Volume 34, Article 14
http://www.demographic-research.org 417
"diverging destinies". Future research should consider whether longitudinal patterns of
maternal labor force participation affect the wellbeing of families and children, and
examine differences by maternal education.
