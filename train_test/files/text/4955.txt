Introduction
Suicide prevention remains a challenge in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), where 75per cent of the world's
suicides occur and where psychiatric resources are scarce
(World Health Organization (WHO), 2014). Integral to sui-
cide prevention is the provision of appropriate care to suicide
attempters; nonfatal suicidal behaviour carries a high risk of
repetition and is associated with suicide. The dominant bio-
medical view asserts that suicidal behaviour is a symptom of
psychopathology and that the treatment of psychiatric illness
is the cornerstone of suicide prevention (Marsh, 2010). This
psychiatric view of suicide has been critiqued within the field
of critical suicidology for its failure to take account of the
contextual, socio-cultural, economic and historic factors
which contribute to the aetiology of suicidal behaviour
(White, 2015; White et al., 2015). Furthermore, mainstream
suicidology has attracted criticism for failing to document the
insider perspectives of suicide attempters (Hjelmeland and
Knizek, 2010, 2011). Few studies have investigated the
expressed support needs of suicide attempters, particularly in
LMICs. It is within this context that I set out to document the
expressed support needs of a group of patients admitted to an
urban hospital in South Africa (SA) following a medically
serious suicide attempt. My intention was to understand from
the patient's point of view what might be done on discharge
from hospital to reduce the risk of repetition of suicidal
behaviour. The findings are discussed within the context of
calls from critical suicidologists to focus on the socio-cultural
context of suicide, and the challenges of suicide prevention in
LMICs, like SA.1 The findings provide insight into possible
suicide prevention strategies and highlight structural prob-
lems with the provision of mental health care in low-resource
environments.

Abstract
Few studies have explored the expressed support needs of suicide attempters in developing countries. Data, collected via
in-depth interviews with suicide attempters admitted to a South African hospital, were analysed using thematic content
analysis. Participants explicitly asked for integrated psycho-social services at a primary health care level and say they
require assistance with alleviating psychiatric symptoms, establishing connectedness, interpersonal conflict and solving
socio-economic problems. Findings highlight the importance for suicide prevention of (1) considering interpersonal
and contextual socio-economic factors in addition to the psychiatric causes of suicidal behaviour; and (2) multilevel
strategies, intersectoral collaboration and integrated person-centred primary health care.

Report of empirical study
2 Health Psychology Open 
there are an estimated 20­30 suicide attempts (Wasserman,
2016). A suicide attempt is defined as, `A nonhabitual act
with nonfatal outcome that the individual, expecting to, or
taking the risk to die or to inflict bodily harm, initiated and
carried out with the purpose of bringing about wanted
changes'(De Leo et al., 2006: 14). Individuals who attempt
suicide are at high risk of repetition and are 20­30
times
more likely than the general population to die by suicide
(Hawton et al., 2003; Kapur et al., 2005; Owens et al.,
2002). Suicide attempters who present at hospitals are a
well-delineated group of patients who may be amenable to
targeted interventions to reduce their suicide risk (Arensman
et al., 2011). It is, however, not always clear what interven-
tions are effective to prevent suicides (Brown and Jager-
Hyman, 2014; Hetrick et al., 2016). Critics have noted that
the ineffectiveness of suicide prevention strategies is in
large part a result of the fact that suicide has predominantly
been conceptualised within a biomedical risk-factor para-
digm; consequently, much of the research has been quanti-
tative, de-contextual and narrowly focused on a handful of
individual variables and psychiatric factors (Hjelmeland
and Knizek, 2010, 2011; Kral, 2012; White et al., 2015).
Evidence of this is seen in a recently published meta-analy-
sis which concluded that in spite of decades of quantitative
risk factor suicide research, experts' ability to identify
patients who will engage in suicidal behaviour is no better
than chance and has not improved significantly in the last
five decades (Franklin et al., 2016).
Typically, suicide prevention strategies have focused on
identifying psychiatric risk factors and promoting access to
psychiatric care for at-risk individuals. For example, the
four-level approach to suicide prevention, advocated by the
European Alliance Against Depression, focuses on educat-
ing primary health care professionals and the general popu-
lation about psychiatric risk factors for suicide, and
increasing access to appropriate psychiatric care for at-risk
individuals (Székely et al., 2013). A systematic review of
psychological autopsy studies concluded that `Suicide pre-
vention strategies may be most effective if focused on the
treatment of mental disorders'(Cavanagh et al., 2003: 395).
Critical suicidologists have pointed out the problems of
focusing solely on psychiatric risk factors while failing to
consider the socio-cultural context within which suicidal
behaviours occur (Hjelmeland et al., 2014). These critiques
have spurned a number of studies which have attempted to
examine more broadly the role of contextual factors in the
aetiology of suicide. Examples include the systematic
review on the relationship between poverty and suicidal
behaviour in LMICs (Iemmi et al., 2016) and a study among
perinatal women living in a low-resource environment in
SA which found that socio-economic adversity was a better
predictor of suicidal behaviour than psychiatric conditions
(Onah et al., 2016).
Authors have drawn attention to the role of the socio-
cultural context in suicidal behaviour (Chan and Thambu,
2016). There are, for example, studies which have described
how suicidal behaviour in different parts of the world is
shaped by models of hegemonic masculinity and prescrip-
tive gender roles (Olive et al., 2012), religion (Cook, 2014;
Dervic et al., 2004), and attitudes towards suicide and help
seeking (Reynders et al., 2014). This renewed interest in
socio-cultural context has led some authors to question the
role of mental illness in precipitating suicidal behaviour.
Hjelmeland et al. (2014) have gone so far as to assert that
`suicide is about far more than mental disorders, and may
be about something quite different' (p. 1370). There are
good reasons to consider a wide range of contextual, socio-
cultural and economic factors when planning suicide pre-
vention interventions, particularly in low-resource
environments. In many LMICs, psychiatric resources are
scarce and consequently suicide prevention efforts that rely
primarily on mental health professionals are unlikely to
have the requisite reach to be effective.
Cahill (2007) and Cleary (2012) have described the
potential benefits of investigating first-person accounts of
the lived experiences of suicidal persons. White (2016) has
affirmed that `those with lived experience of suicidality
have invaluable insights to contribute to the current evi-
dence base' (p. 349). Documenting the voices of suicide
attempters may help to highlight the social context in which
suicidal behaviour occurs and to draw attention to factors,
such as culture, which are not easily measured and included
in quantitative studies. Qualitative studies in this field not
only hold the promise of providing insight into the suicidal
mind but, perhaps more importantly, can tell us what it is
like to be a suicidal person negotiating one's way through
the health care system (Bantjes and Swartz, 2017).
Furthermore, qualitative studies with suicide attempters
may provide insight into the support needs of this group of
patients and highlight problems with the organisation of
care within the health care system which impede suicide
prevention. Although this is a largely unexplored area of
research in LMICs, in the last 10years, there has been a bur-
geoning of research from high-income western countries
which describes the lived experiences of suicide attempters
(White, 2016). One of the earliest studies exploring the lived
experience of suicidal individuals was undertaken by Rosen
(1975), who interviewed seven individuals who had jumped
from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco in suicide
attempts. On the basis of these qualitative interviews, Rosen
(1975) suggested concrete strategies for suicide prevention.
This has established a tradition of employing qualitative
research with suicide attempters in order to generate evi-
dence for suicide prevention. On the basis of her review of
qualitative studies on suicide ideation, attempts, and suicide
prevention, White (2016) concluded, `Far from providing a
definitive statement about the nature and meaning of suici-
dality, these studies have shown the complex, dynamic,
context-dependent, multiple, and contradictory character of
suicide ideation and attempts' (p. 349).

Methodology
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 80 adult
patients (46 females and 34 males) admitted to an urban
hospital, following a suicide attempt. Participants were
between the ages of 18 and 67years.
Interviews lasted between 45 and 90
minutes and were
conducted by the author, who is a psychologist. Participants
were asked to recount how they had come to be in hospital
and to describe what they thought they might need to pre-
vent future episodes of suicidal behaviour. Participants were
prompted to talk about the socio-cultural context in which
their suicide attempt occurred and to express their own
understanding of their behaviour. Interviews were con-
ducted in a private space within the hospital prior to patients'
discharge. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed.
Data were analysed independently by two researchers using
thematic content analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). An
inductive approach (Thomas, 2006) was adopted to code the
data using Atlas-ti software. Theoretical sense was made of
the findings after a process of triangulation of codes. This
data-driven process led to the identification of five superor-
dinate themes which describe patients' expressed support
needs, namely (1) alleviation of psychiatric and somatic
symptoms, (2) access to integrated psychological care at a
primary health care level, (3) help to establish connected-
ness and belonging, (4) assistance with interpersonal and
family conflict and (5) practical help to solve situational
problems. The analysis of data for this article was confined
to identify expressed support needs, a more detailed account
of the patients' first-person understanding of the socio-cul-
tural context in which their suicide attempt occurred and the
contextual factors that contributed to this behaviour will be
presented in subsequent publications.
Ethics
Permission to conduct this study was obtained from the
health science research ethics committees at the University
of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University. Institutional
permission was obtained from the relevant authorities at the
hospital and participants gave written informed consent to
participate in the study. Pseudonyms have been used to pro-
tect the identity of the participants.
Findings
Alleviation of psychiatric and somatic symptoms
Many participants asked for assistance with the alleviation
of psychiatric and somatic symptoms. They ascribed their
suicide attempts to behavioural, cognitive and emotional
symptoms which they described as unbearable. Cleo said,
`I just need to be back on my medication. That is very
important'. Nancy said that she needed professional help to
control her feelings and thoughts because `... there is no
way out of it and I feel like I'm drowning in everything that
is happening in my mind'. Similarly, Jaco said,
I just don't want to feel this way. I will get any help I can to
take it (these feelings) off my mind ... I don't know why I
can't get healed of this inner pain. It draws me to suicide every
time.
While some patients described symptoms of depressive
and anxiety disorders which they said contributed to their
attempted suicide, there were other patients who spoke
about the role of trauma and loss. These patients asked for
help with symptoms such as re-experiencing the trauma,
high levels of fear, hyper vigilance and panic. Tim explained
how he had been repeatedly sexually abused when he was
growing up and how the trauma of this had left him with
unbearable memories and high levels of anxiety and mis-
trust, with which he needed help. Similarly, participants
described complicated grief reactions to recent losses. Jane,
an 18-year-old school girl, described how her mother had
recently died, leaving her alone and without financial or
family support to look after her young sister. She said she
was overcome with sadness at her mother's death but had
no way to process this grief because she was left unsup-
ported and responsible for her sister.
Some participants described symptoms of psychotic ill-
ness, including persecutory and command hallucinations,
which they said contributed to their suicidal behaviour.
These participants said they required help with `the voices'
and `the crazy thoughts inside my head'. Vuyo expressed
this by saying, `... maybe I can put this pain to bed and
maybe just stop hearing everything that they (the voices)
are saying about me, because I am tired of it'.
Participants also described the role of chronic pain in
their suicide attempt and said they would require help
with this. David said, `I need to be comfortable (free of
pain) at least'.
Participants expressed a need for sustained psychiatric
care within a supportive environment. Some patients
described their previous experience of receiving care, say-
ing that they had felt rushed and pushed aside by mental
health service providers. Nina described the kind of care
she required saying,
Don't rush me when I tell you, Doctor, this is what I've been
through ­ I was raped or whatever. Don't push me aside,
Doctor, because then I don't feel open enough to speak to you.
Then I just close up.
Access to integrated psychological care at a
primary health care level
Participants articulated a need for psychotherapy and emo-
tional support. They said they did not have access to ongoing
4 Health Psychology Open 
psychological care in their communities. They requested
psycho-social support to be integrated into existing primary
health care settings. Ivan explained, `... they should actually
have community day-hospitals where they can have counsel-
lors to help us if you feel down, besides sisters. We see sisters
maybe once a month. But we need to have counsellors on
standby for us'. Similarly, Jannie said, `... if I can just go into
therapy where it can help for at least a few months. The sup-
port and the fact of professional help, it will be much easier
for me ...'
Some participants asked for assistance to develop insight
into their emotions, change their behaviour and regulate
their feelings. Anita said, `But the thing is, how do I change
my behaviour from having the same negative feelings go
around and around and around in my head? How does that
change? How can I stop that from happening?' Likewise,
Bongani said, `I'd like to understand what triggers my
mood. Like specially when my mood goes down ­ what
triggers it? And to learn methods of better managing when
I lose focus and when my mind starts going ballistic'.
Help to establish relationships, connection and
belonging
Many participants were emphatic about their need for help
to establish connection and emotional closeness to others.
They expressed a desire for emotionally supportive rela-
tionships. Anne said she needed `people to be there for me'
in order to curb future suicidal behaviour. Anton said it
would help him if he was `not so alone' and if `people actu-
ally listen to you and talk to you and pay attention to you'.
Anton went on to describe the power of physical and emo-
tional closeness to curb his suicidal behaviour by saying,
`That's what I always tell my girlfriend, the only thing that
can help me is if she just comes and holds me and tells me
that she loves me. I know for sure that that will help me'.
Some participants described how their suicide attempts
had been precipitated by a sense of disconnection and `not
belonging'. Jane said, `I'm just like faulty, I just don't
belong here. I don't belong here'.
Some participants said they needed help to establish
supportive and trusting relationships. Andile articulated
this by saying he needed to `meet people that are in my situ-
ation. Maybe we can support one another and help and talk
to one another openly, instead of getting that pushing down
from people'. Colin echoed this saying,
Doctor, like I say, (I need) people I can talk to, just for one
minute or two minutes or whatever for a day. People I can talk
to who say, listen here, we are interested in helping you. We
are genuinely interested to help you.
Similarly, Sally said, `I need a person that I can trust to
speak to, and help me through the difficult times that I'm
facing'.
Participants acknowledged that they needed help with
establishing intimacy, and finding connection. Liz said,
It's like nobody is around. I can't get close to somebody. I tried
so much. I even took a husband, got married and had a child,
but I can't be close to somebody. I'm so far away from my
child as well. I can't get closer to somebody.
Participants said that they needed to learn how to com-
municate their distress to others and how to ask for help in
adaptive ways. Anthea described her experience saying,
`... it feels like you're alone. No one worries about your
problems. If you speak, and try to explain, people do not
realise that you are calling out for help'. She said she would
need help to communicate her distress in order to ensure
that she did not hurt herself again as a way of accessing
support and care.
Assistance with resolving interpersonal and
family conflict
Participants expressed a need for help to resolve interper-
sonal difficulties and conflicted family relationships. Tanya
said, `I need to sort out my relationship with my family'.
Neil said,
The support I will need, if Doctor can phone my family and
explain to them that it's not to do with money or anything like
that. I just want them to support me where if I've got something
to tell them, you know, don't turn their backs towards me ...
Some participants also asked for help with communicating
their needs to their family. Nigel said,
My family also supports me, but I would like them to also
support me where ­ it's like if I go, at least come with me once
a month to the psychiatric sister or to the doctor and ask how
am I doing. You know, things like that, which they don't do.
Participants described difficult family circumstances
and identified family relationships as significant stressors
which contributed to their suicide attempt. Nancy said,
`Sometimes I wish I wasn't born into this family'.
Participants said that they needed help to achieve independ-
ence from their families and expressed a desire for libera-
tion. Chris said, `I'm getting tired of living with my family.
That's what I want, I want to get my own place'. Fatima
said, `And I really do want to be independent ­ I don't want
to have to ask my family and people for stuff'.
Help to solve situational problems
Participants expressed a need for practical help to solve con-
crete situational problems such as finding employment,
resolving a financial or legal crisis and finding a place to
stay. Economic hardship and unemployment were identified
Bantjes 5
as significant stressors which contributed to participants'
suicidal behaviour; they said they would need relief from
this burden. Jack said, `But a lot of it boils down to money',
and Frans said, `I also want to have my own business. I need
to make some money'. Participants expressed a belief that if
they had access to financial resources they would feel liber-
ated from and more in control of the situation that had pre-
cipitated their suicidal crisis. Sabu explained, `I think what
will help me is a better job to get out of that harshness. I'm
applying for jobs. I think that's one big obstacle ...'.
Similarly, Mark said,
Like if I had won the jackpot, I could just have taken care of all
those worries ... I'm just saying if I was in a position where I
could at least have been in control, I don't believe that I would
have gotten to that stage (of wanting to die).
Many participants said they needed help finding a place
to live. Participants who were homeless described the hard-
ship of having no fixed abode and living on the street or in
a shelter. Other participants expressed a desire to find alter-
native accommodation because their current living arrange-
ments were stressful. Karin said, `If I had a home as well,
an actual house where I could go ...', and Fred said, `I want
to move out of the house (where I am staying now)'.
Discussion
Participants in this study are explicit in their request for
ongoing psychiatric and medical care, as part of a strategy
to curb their own suicidal behaviour. This assertion seems
to point to an implicit understanding that their behaviour
was at least in part a function of psychiatric and medical
conditions which they believe doctors are equipped to alle-
viate. It is possible that the primacy participants give to
what is essentially a biomedical formulation of their own
suicidal behaviour, reflects something of the context in
which the data for this study were collected. Interviews for
this study were conducted in a medical setting by a
researcher identified as a psychologist and with patients
who had been admitted to hospital and who had all received
medical and psychiatric care following their suicide
attempt. It is plausible that the demand characteristics of
the situation in which the data were collected, the position-
ing of the data collector as a psychologist and the partici-
pants recent experience of receiving psychiatric and
medical care, all shaped how the participants narrated their
suicide attempt and framed what they expressed as their
support needs. It is also possible that the participants in this
study are simply reproducing the dominant biomedical
view of suicidal behaviour as a symptom of mental illness
because they believe this is what is expected of them and
they do not want to appear unsophisticated in their under-
standing of their own behaviour. Nonetheless, if we do as
authors such as Hjelmeland (2012) suggest, and we take
seriously the insights and voices of the `true experts' on
suicide (i.e. suicide attempters) when seeking to understand
suicidal behaviour and plan interventions, then we have to
acknowledge that many participants in this study explicitly
attribute their suicide attempts to symptoms of mental ill-
ness and they ask for ongoing professional care to alleviate
these psychiatric symptoms.
From the perspective of the participants in this study,
appropriate, affordable, accessible, ongoing psychiatric
care is integral to suicide prevention. This finding is
entirely consistent with the conclusions drawn in a review
of systematic reviews on effective interventions for sui-
cidal behaviour; the review concluded that best practice in
suicide prevention entails detecting and treating psycho-
pathology, principally depressive disorders (Van der
Feltz-Cornelis et al., 2010). The focus on depression in
the international suicide prevention literature is notewor-
thy, particularly since the participants in this study iden-
tify needing help with symptoms of anxiety, psychotic
illnesses, posttraumatic stress disorder, grief and pain dis-
orders. Participants' request for ongoing post-discharge
psychiatric care is congruent with international best prac-
tice literature. There is evidence that `professionals'main-
tenance of long-term contact with patients at risk of
suicide can exert a suicide-prevention influence' (Motto
and Bostrom, 2001: 828).
Participants' explicit request for ongoing psychiatric
and psychological care for symptoms of psychopathol-
ogy and psychological distress calls into question the
assertion by Hjelmeland et al. (2014) that mental illness
and suicidal behaviour are unrelated and that suicide
may be `about something quite different' from mental
illness (p. 1370). It is significant that suicide attempters
in this study, all of whom live in resource-constrained
environments, explicitly assert the importance of access
to psychiatric care and ask for access to ongoing psychi-
atric treatment and integrated psychological support.
There is a real risk that claims made by authors such as
Hjelmeland et al. (2014) that suicidal behaviour is not a
symptom of mental illness will be taken up by policy
makers to undervalue or discredit the importance of pro-
viding appropriate, accessible and effective psychiatric
and psychological care as part of national suicide pre-
vention strategies. There is a particular danger of this in
low-resource environments, like SA, where the health
care system is already under pressure and where there
are a high number of competing demands for scarce psy-
chiatric resources (Chopra et al., 2009; Mayosi et al.,
2012). It is one thing to argue as Hjelmeland et al. (2014)
do that suicide is not a psychiatric condition, in high-
income countries where there is easy access to effective
psychiatric care for those who seek it, but it is quite
another thing to argue that psychiatric responses to sui-
cide prevention are not important in contexts where there
are inadequate and inaccessible psychiatric services.
6 Health Psychology Open 
It is significant that participants describe their struggle
to access mental health care at a community level and feel-
ing rushed by the psychiatric service providers they encoun-
ter. This finding draws attention to the health care context
within which suicide attempts occur in SA and highlights
the significant mental health treatment gap, the shortage of
public mental health resources, and the fact that primary
health care in the country is still predominantly biomedical
in its orientation (Lund et al., 2010; Petersen, 2000; Petersen
and Lund, 2011). The participants in this study request
ongoing integrated person-centred care which includes
psycho-social support at a community level. The findings
suggest that integrating psycho-social services in primary
health care settings is important for suicide prevention in
SA. It is noteworthy that the policy framework to achieve
this is already in place in the country (Department of
Health, 1997) in the form of the White Paper for the
Transformation of the Health System in South Africa, but
that implementation of this policy has been hampered by a
range of factors, including resource constraints and a lack
of political will. The constraints on clinic staff in primary
health care and community clinics have resulted in a situa-
tion where health care workers do little more than dispense
medication without providing any psycho-social interven-
tions (Bond et al., 2001; Petersen, 2000).
While participants attribute their suicidal behaviour to
psychological distress and mental illness, they also
acknowledge the significance of interpersonal factors and
explicitly ask for help in establishing connectedness, build-
ing relationships and resolving conflict with family mem-
bers. This finding highlights the interpersonal context of
suicidal behaviour and draws attention to the need for fam-
ily interventions and interpersonally orientated psychother-
apy with individuals who have made suicide attempts.
Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a time-limited psy-
chotherapy that focuses on current problems with patients'
relationships (Weissman et al., 2000). A systematic review
by Cuijpers et al. (2011) concluded that there is good evi-
dence to support the use of IPT for depression. Similarly,
evidence supports the use of IPT to treat mood disorders in
primary care settings (Linde et al., 2015). Studies have also
showed that IPT is effective in significantly reducing sui-
cide ideation, death ideation, repetition of self-harm and
depressive symptom severity, and resulted in significant
improvements in perceived meaning in life, social adjust-
ment, perceived social support and psychological well-
being (Guthrie et al., 2001; Heisel et al., 2015).Asystematic
review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of psychologi-
cal and psycho-social approaches to reduce repetition of
self-harm, concluded that on the basis of current evidence it
is not yet clear what interventions should be delivered to
reduce the risk of repetition of self-harm although `inter-
ventions with an interpersonal focus and targeted on the
precipitants of self-harm may be the best candidates'
(Hetrick et al., 2016: 1). Integrating psychological
interventions alongside psychiatric and pharmaceutical
interventions is consistent with best practice in suicide pre-
vention which advocates the use of multilevel strategies,
that is, strategies that target several populations or several
levels within health care systems or include interventions
with more than one focus, such as pharmacotherapy and
psychotherapy (Van der Feltz-Cornelis et al., 2010).
The findings suggest that suicide attempters believe in
the importance of establishing connectedness as an antidote
to suicide. The interpersonal-psychological theory specifi-
cally identifies the role of `thwarted belonging'in the aetiol-
ogy of suicide (Hagan et al., 2016). Lack of relationships,
social isolation, loneliness, living alone and being single are
all recognised risk factors for suicidal behaviour (Ferreira
et al., 2015; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015). Participants' request
for help to establish connection and belonging is thus con-
sistent with theory and empirical evidence. This finding
highlights the importance of addressing the interpersonal
context in which suicidal behaviour occurs as part of the
post-discharge care of suicide attempters.
It is noteworthy that participants articulate a need for
practical help to solve socio-economic and situational prob-
lems, such as financial difficulties, unemployment, home-
lessness and legal difficulties. These situational stressors are
outside the bounds of medicine to remedy, and highlight the
social and economic factors that contribute to suicidal
behaviour. This finding suggests that teaching suicide
attempters problem-solving strategies, helping them to
identify alternative solutions and connecting them to appro-
priate social and legal services might reduce their suicide
risk. There is evidence of the effectiveness of brief prob-
lem-solving cognitive therapy for suicide prevention
(Gustavson et al., 2016; Hatcher et al., 2011; Stewart et al.,
2009). Data suggest that brief cognitive therapy produces
rapid changes on dimensions such as negative problem ori-
entation and impulsivity/carelessness problem-solving
style (Ghahramanlou-Holloway et al., 2012). Of course,
there is a danger here that advocating problem-solving
interventions delivered to individuals as part of a suicide
prevention strategy reinforces the idea that suicidal behav-
iour is a problem that is contained within the individual and
that building the resilience of the individual is central to
preventing suicide. Interventions, such as teaching prob-
lem-solving skills to individuals and building individual
resilience, deny the reality that many individuals in LMICs
live under conditions of endemic violence, structural pov-
erty, enduring inequality and continuous trauma. It is note-
worthy that participants in this study ask for help with
problems such as poverty, unemployment and homeless-
ness. It is also significant that in the context of their suicide
attempts, participants talk about their exposure to trauma
and violence, particularly sexual- and gender-based vio-
lence. While it is no doubt important to provide problem-
solving interventions and build individual resilience in order
to prevent suicides, it is equally important to take note of
Bantjes 7
what the data reveal about socio-economic and contextual
problems that are faced by the suicide attempters in this
study. This social and economic context needs to be
addressed at a political and economic level in order to
reduce suicidal behaviour in LMICs. Fox (2003) has noted
that when research directly engages with the `politics of the
setting which it explores'(p. 96, emphasis in original), there
is real potential for the research to become a source of social
justice and to transform social relationships. The insights of
the participants in this study certainly make visible sites of
potential social and political transformation.
The kind of support requested by the suicide attempters
in this study is unlikely to be achieved without intersectoral
collaboration. The WHO has defined intersectoral collabo-
ration for health as the establishment of working relation-
ships between the health sector and other sectors (such as
social welfare, criminal justice and housing services) in
order to improve health outcomes more effectively, effi-
ciently or sustainably than would otherwise be achieved
(WHO, 1997). The effectiveness of intersectoral collabora-
tion for the community-based treatment of mental illnesses
has been documented and is considered best practice in a
number of high-income countries (Darlington and Feeney,
2008; WHO, 1997). The importance of intersectoral col-
laboration for suicide prevention, particularly in LMICs,
has been described (Bertolote et al., 2006; Reynolds and
Conroy, 1999; Wang et al., 2008; WHO, 2012). There are a
number of obstacles to achieving intersectoral collabora-
tion in LMICs (Brooke-Sumner et al., 2016). Intersectoral
approaches to the treatment of mental illnesses in SA have
not been adequately achieved, especially in rural areas,
because of the lack of dedicated funding for such approaches
(Petersen and Lund, 2011; Thornicroft et al., 2010), failures
of management and leadership to implement relevant pol-
icy (Jenkins et al., 2011) and a lack of political will (Brooke-
Sumner et al., 2016). Brooke-Sumner et al. (2016) have
further noted that the attainment of effective intersectoral
collaboration is a complex challenge in LMICs due to the
scarcity of resources, problems pertaining to the allocation
and use of resources, inadequate organisational structures,
mistrust, poor communication and a lack of distinct roles.
Limitations
Data were collected from one urban hospital in SA. It is pos-
sible that the experiences described by these participants are
highly context specific and representative of public services
within a particular region of the country. Suicide attempters
in other centres and rural areas may have different support
needs and other experiences of the health care system.
Conclusion
The findings of this study draw attention to the need for sui-
cide prevention efforts in SAto include access to psychiatric
care and integrated person-centred psycho-social support at
a primary health care level. Furthermore, the findings high-
light the interpersonal, social and economic context within
which suicide attempts occur as well as systemic problems
with the organisation of care within the health system which
impede suicide prevention in SA. From the perspective of
the participants in this study, multilevel approaches and
intersectoral collaboration would seem to be important com-
ponents of a national suicide prevention programme in SA.
There would, however, appear to be a number of problems
with the structure and delivery of health care in SA which
impede the attainment of these ideals. Crucially, the find-
ings of this study draw attention to the need in LMICs like
SA, for suicide prevention interventions to focus on provid-
ing psychiatric and psychological care, and building indi-
viduals'resilience while also addressing systemic social and
economic issues.
