Background: Recent research indicates that the best-fitting structural model of psychopathology includes a general
factor capturing comorbidity (p) and several more specific, orthogonal factors. Little is known about the stability of
these factors, although two opposing developmental processes have been proposed: dynamic mutualism suggests
that symptom-level interaction and reinforcement may lead to a strengthening of comorbidity (p) over time, whereas
p-differentiation suggests a general vulnerability to psychopathology that gives way to increasingly distinct patterns
of symptoms over time. In order to test both processes, we examine two forms of developmental stability from ages 2
to 14 years: strength (i.e., consistency in the amount of variance explained by general and specific factors) and
phenotypic stability (i.e., homotypic and heterotypic continuity). Methods: Data are from the NICHD Study of Early
Child Care and Youth Development. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed nine times between ages 2 and
14 years (n = 1,253) using the Child Behavior Checklist completed by mothers. Confirmatory bifactor modeling was
used to test structural models of psychopathology at each age. Consistency in strength was examined by calculating
the Explained Common Variance (ECV) and phenotypic stability was investigated with cross-lagged modeling of the
general and specific factors. Results: Bifactor models fit the data well across this developmental period. ECV values
were reasonably consistent across development, with the general factor accounting for the majority of shared
variance (61%­71%). Evidence of both homotypic and heterotypic continuity emerged, with most heterotypic
continuity involving the general factor, as it both predicted and was predicted by specific factors. Conclusions: A
bifactor model effectively captures psychopathological comorbidity from early childhood through adolescence. The
longitudinal associations between the general and specific factors provide evidence for both the hypothesized
processes (dynamic mutualism and p-differentiation) occurring through development. Keywords: Comorbidity;
continuity; developmental psychopathology; externalizing disorder; internalizing disorder.
Introduction
Widespread comorbidity (Kessler et al., 2005) cou-
pled with shared genetic and environmental risk
(Waldman, Poore, van Hulle, Rathouz, & Lahey,
2016; Wichstrøm, Belsky, & Steinsbekk, 2017) has
led to a surge in models that conceptualize psy-
chopathology as a number of broad transdiagnostic
dimensions. Currently the most widely discussed
model includes a general psychopathological factor,
labeled p, that is purported to account for the
moderate correlations between psychopathological
dimensions (Caspi et al., 2014; Lahey, Krueger,
Rathouz, Waldman, & Zald, 2016). In a psychome-
tric sense, p is typically represented as a general
bifactor that is orthogonally related to a set of
specific factors (Caspi et al., 2014; Lahey et al.,
2012). As such, p explains the variance shared by
all psychiatric symptoms/disorders, with addi-
tional variance accounted for by distinct specific
factors. Specific factors typically take the form of
internalizing and externalizing, with additional
factors depending on the symptoms/disorders
assessed (e.g., thought disorder, attention prob-
lems). This model has been replicated in diverse
samples of adults (Greene & Eaton, 2017; Lahey
et al., 2012) and adolescents/children (Hankin
et al., 2017; Laceulle, Vollebergh, & Ormel, 2015;
Patalay et al., 2015), using both symptom- (Car-
ragher et al., 2016; Patalay et al., 2015) and dis-
order-level data (Greene & Eaton, 2017; Laceulle
et al., 2015).
Even as p is empirically well-established, it
remains a somewhat controversial topic. This model
has been criticized for lacking parsimony, and sim-
ulation research suggests that fit statistics may be
biased toward bifactor models when they are com-
pared with traditional correlated factor models,
leading some to suggest that p is merely a statistical
artifact (Bonifay, Lane, & Reise, 2017). Whether p
reflects a substantive construct remains open to
debate; nevertheless, robust correlations with exter-
nal variables (e.g., cognitive ability, negative emo-
tionality, demographic factors), and predictive value
for future psychopathology (Lahey, Krueger,
Rathouz, Waldman, & Zald, 2017; Patalay et al.,

2015) suggest that there is at least some utility and
informativeness to this general factor.
Despite myriad studies of p in recent years, there is
little understanding of how it manifests through
development and to what degree it changes over time
(Murray, Eisner, & Ribeaud, 2016). With regard to its
development, two opposing processes have been pro-
posed (Murray et al., 2016). First, `p-differentiation'
presumes that p reflects a general liability to any and
all forms of psychopathology, with symptom expres-
sion becoming increasingly specific over time (Murray
et al., 2016; Patalay et al., 2015). The fact that broad
psychopathological dimensions are typically favored
earlier in childhood, giving way to more distinct
categorical diagnoses as adolescents approach adult-
hood, in both research and clinical practice, certainly
suggests that symptom manifestations become more
specific over time (Caspi et al., 2014; Patalay et al.,
2015). The alternative perspective, referred to as
dynamic mutualism, stipulates that, rather than
reflecting overall risk, p captures local-level interac-
tions, whereby symptoms directly influence and rein-
force each other (Murray et al., 2016; Van Der Maas
et al., 2006). When left unchecked, this may result in
stronger inter-item associations over time (Van Der
Maas et al., 2006). In consequence, symptoms that
are initially distinct may become increasingly associ-
ated as psychopathology develops, resulting in
increased cross-domain comorbidity (Caspi et al.,
2014; Murray et al., 2016).
Investigation of the developmental stability of p
may help illuminate its fundamental character, yet
few such studies have been reported. Thus, the
present report seeks to evaluate and illuminate two
types of developmental stability: strength consis-
tency and phenotypic stability. The former refers to
the extent that both p and specific factors explain a
consistent amount of variance over time, whereas
the latter refers to the extent to which symptom
manifestations remain consistent over development.
Both forms of stability may provide insight into the
developmental nature of p. For example, given that
dynamic mutualism is based on the idea that inter-
item correlations become stronger due to reciprocal
reinforcement, one would expect to see an increase
in the dominant source of covariance (i.e., p) over
time at the expense of specific factors (Caspi et al.,
2014; Murray et al., 2016; Van Der Maas et al.,
2006). This would be reflected in greater levels of
cross-domain (i.e., both internalizing and external-
izing symptomatology/disorders) comorbidity over
development. Alternatively, if p represents a more
general liability to psychopathology which manifests
as increasingly specific expressions over time, one
would expect the opposite pattern to occur, with
increasingly domain-specific patterns of psy-
chopathology emerging (Murray et al., 2016; Patalay
et al., 2015).
In the only study to have investigated this issue to
date, Murray et al. (2016) examined the consistency
of the variance explained by p in a representative
cohort assessed eight times between ages 7 and
15 years (n = 1,572). They found that the variance
attributable to both p and specific factors remained
consistent over time, with p accounting for the vast
majority of shared variance. Notably, the conclu-
sions drawn from these results were that neither
dynamic mutualism nor p-differentiation alone were
sufficient to explain the development of comorbidity
over this period, as their hypothesized patterns of
increasing or decreasing symptom covariance attri-
butable to p were not observed. Indeed, it remains
possible that both dynamic processes are at play
and, when examined solely using a variance
explained approach, this may result in the two
opposing processes effectively cancelling each other
out. This possibility is explicitly examined in the
current study, as we investigate the phenotypic
stability of p and specific psychopathological factors.
Phenotypic stability is perhaps best thought of in
terms of homotypic continuity (i.e., one construct
predicting itself at a later time point) and heterotypic
continuity (i.e., one construct predicting another
construct at a later time point) (Angold, Costello, &
Erkanli, 1999). Evidence of heterotypic continuity
could be consistent with dynamic mutualism or p-
differentiation, depending on the direction of the
effects. A positive association between p at baseline
and a specific factor at a later time point would be in
line with p-differentiation, with a general manifesta-
tion of comorbid psychopathology placing an indi-
vidual at risk of more specific manifestations later
on. Alternatively, positive associations between
specific factors at baseline and subsequent p would
suggest that individuals suffering from a particular
type of psychopathology may be more likely to
develop cross-domain comorbidity over time as
intersymptom associations become stronger; this
would be consistent with dynamic mutualism.
To our knowledge, only two studies have examined
the phenotypic stability of p. Greene and Eaton
(2017) examined the homotypic and heterotypic
continuity of p, as well as the specific internalizing
and externalizing dimensions in the National Epi-
demiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Condi-
tions (age range 18­90 + years). Strong homotypic
continuity was observed between waves 1 and 2,
with no significant heterotypic continuity, a result
consistent with Snyder, Young, and Hankin's (2017)
study of young adolescents (i.e., between 13.5 and
15 years of age). Such results suggest, once again,
that neither dynamic mutualism nor p-differentia-
tion adequately characterizes the development of p.
It must be noted, however, that both studies just
cited were limited to only two assessment waves,
with little time (approximately 18­24 months)
between assessments. A more extensive longitudinal
investigation, especially one covering a time when
developmental changes are more salient and symp-
tom stability is in greater flux, might provide a

clearer picture of the phenotypic stability of p and
specific factors across development.
The present study aimed to extend current under-
standing of the development of p in three ways. First,
we examine the structure of psychopathology in a
sample assessed nine times from early childhood
(age 2 years) through adolescence (age 14 years). In
light of the fact that most work on the p-factor model
using preadult samples has focused on adolescents
(Hankin et al., 2017; Laceulle et al., 2015; Martel
et al., 2017; Patalay et al., 2015; Snyder, Young, &
Hankin, 2016), although one study includes children
as young as 3 years of age (Olino, Dougherty, Buf-
ferd, Carlson, & Klein, 2014), we are positioned to
determine not only whether the model holds for very
young children but also how it develops over child-
hood and into early adolescence. Moreover, the
research reported herein evaluates the consistency
over time of the strength of the p factor and specific
factors in terms of the variance they account for
across this developmental period. The only previous
study to examine this aspect of p began at age 7
(Murray et al., 2016), potentially missing out on a
key period over which the processes that underlie
comorbidity may develop. Finally, the current work
chronicles phenotypic stability, that is, the homo-
typic and heterotypic continuity of p and specific
factors over time.
Methods
Sample/Participants
Data came from the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth
Development, a prospective cohort study of children born in
1991 at 10 locations across the United States (NICHD Early
Child Care Research Network, 2005). The initial sample com-
prised of 1,364 parent­child pairs. For the present study, data
were available for 1,253 children (51% female). Although the
sample was diverse, it was not designed to be nationally
representative, in that participating families had higher average
income and education and were less likely to be of an ethnic
minority (Watamura, Phillips, Morrissey, McCartney, & Bub,
2011). Ethical approval for the NICHD study was granted by all
data-collecting universities prior to data collection and at each
assessment informed consent was secured from parents and/or
teacher. More detailed descriptions of the NICHD Study, includ-
ing recruitment and assessment procedures, are available
elsewhere (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005).
Measures
Psychopathology was measured using the Child Behavior
Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001), a standardized
parent report completed by mothers at ages 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10,
11, and 14 years. The CBCL assesses 113 psychopathology
symptoms, each of which is rated on a 3-point scale (0 = not
true; 1 = somewhat/sometimes true; 2 = very true/often). For
2­3 year olds, the CBCL/1.5­5 was used (Achenbach, Edel-
brock, & Howell, 1987). The CBCL/6­18 (Achenbach &
Rescorla, 2001), was used to assess problems from age 5 years
on. The CBCL/6­18 is a revised version of the CBCL/4­18
(Achenbach, 1991), in which certain items were replaced (for a
description of these differences see Achenbach & Rescorla,
2001). For consistency, the present study only included items
that were present in both the CBCL/4­18 and CBCL/6­18
measures from age 5 through to age 14; thus, we omitted the
additionalCBCL/6­18itemsthatwere added/replacedfromage
10. Items from the two broad dimensions of internalizing and
externalizing, along with items from the distinct attention
problems syndrome were included in the present analysis.
Due to low endorsement of responses indicating severe presence
of symptoms, items were rescored to indicate presence of
symptoms (i.e., raw responses of 1 or 2 coded as 1) in line with
common practice when conducting item-level analyses of the
CBCL (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001; Deutz, Geeraerts, van
Baar, Dekovi
c, & Prinzie, 2016). To aid estimation, items with
minimal variation (i.e., counts of five individuals or less in either
of the binary categories) were removed.
Missing data
In order to ensure that attrition did not bias the results,
imputation was conducted using the R package AMELIA-II,
which uses expectation-maximization (Honaker, King, &
Blackwell, 2011). A single imputed dataset based on all
participants who provided at least some CBCL data was
produced (n = 1,253).
Statistical analysis
First, confirmatory factor models (CFAs) and confirmatory
bifactor models (CBMs) were estimated at each time point. The
CFAs were comprised of three correlated factors: internalizing,
externalizing and attention problems. The CBMs included a
general factor that was uncorrelated with the three specific
factors. The correlations between the specific factors were fixed
to zero in the bifactor models. Bifactor models were chosen
over second-order factor models as they were deemed a more
appropriate means of testing dynamic mutualism versus p-
differentiation. With second-order modeling, the general factor
represents the variance shared by the specific factors. Bifactor
models differ in that the general and specific factors exist at the
same theoretical level and compete to explain item variance;
thus, the variance explained by both general and specific
factors can be directly compared.
There is some debate as to whether attention/hyperactivity
problems form a distinct psychopathological dimension, or
whether they should be considered part of the externalizing
dimension (Krueger & South, 2009). The developmental liter-
ature has largely treated attention/hyperactivity as a unique
dimension that correlates with both internalizing and exter-
nalizing (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001; Deutz et al., 2016;
Geeraerts et al., 2015). Given that the CBCL makes this
distinction, a distinct attention/hyperactivity factor was
included in the present analysis.
Confirmatory factor models and confirmatory bifactor models
were estimated using the robust weighted least squares estima-
tor (WLSMV). Models were identified by fixing the variance of
each factor to 1, and freely estimating the first factor loading.
Modelfitwas assessedusingtheComparativeFit Index(CFI)and
Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) for which, respectively, values of >.90
reflectacceptable fit and>.95representverygoodmodelfit(Hu &
Bentler, 1999; Little, 2013), and the root mean-square error of
approximation (RMSEA) (Steiger, 1990), for which values below
.06 are considered acceptable (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Construct
reliability (H) was assessed based on the guidelines of Hancock
and Mueller (2001). H evaluates how well a latent variable is
represented by its given items, and as such how suitable and
replicable an SEM model is likely to be (Rodriguez, Reise, &
Haviland, 2016). H is calculated as the ratio of variance
explained by a latent variable relative to the variance left
unexplained. Ranging from 0 to 1, higher values indicate better

defined latent variables, with values greater than .8 deemed
well-defined and likely stable across studies (Hancock &
Mueller, 2001).
Strength consistency
To compare the relative strength of both the general and
specific factors across time, the explained common variance
(ECV) for each factor was calculated at each time point. The
ECV was developed to test the unidimensionality of a psycho-
metric scale and is calculated by dividing the variance
explained by the factor of interest by the variance explained
by the general and specific factors combined. ECV values can
also be calculated in a similar manner for the specific factors.
ECV values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1
suggesting a greater share of variance explained. There are
no established cutoffs in ECV values; it has been suggested
that ECV values ranging from .6 (Reise, Scheines, Widaman, &
Haviland, 2013) to .85 (Reise & Revicki, 2014) indicate that a
factor is the main source of shared variance.
Phenotypic stability
Homotypic and heterotypic continuity of the general and
specific factors were examined using cross-lagged panel anal-
ysis. Because a single structural equation model was not
possible due to the number of parameters involved, a `two-step'
approach was adopted. First, factor models were specified and
estimated at each age and factor scores saved. Second, these
factor scores were used as observed variables in the cross-
lagged regression model (Figure 2). This model was estimated
using robust maximum likelihood (MLR) in Mplus 7.4 (Muth
en
& Muth
en, 2012).
Results
First presented are results of the overall model fit,
followed by those pertaining to strength consistency
and, thereafter, phenotypic stability.
Overall model fit, factor loadings, and reliability
The fit statistics for the correlated factor and bifactor
models are presented in Table 1. The CFAs mostly
indicated adequate fit, with the one exception being
the correlated model at the 3-year time point
(TLI < .90). The bifactor models all demonstrated
adequate-to-good fit (Little, 2013).
Means and standard deviations for the scales,
standardized factor loadings, and construct reliability
values (H) at each age are presented in the online
supplementary materials (Tables S1­S9). H values
were highest for p, ranging from .95 to .97. H values
were also consistently above .8 for internalizing. This
suggests both p and internalizing factors were well
represented by their items (Hancock & Mueller, 2001).
H values ranged from .70 to .82 for externalizing and
.59 to .68 for attention, suggesting these factors were
less well-defined (Hancock & Mueller, 2001).
Strength consistency
Figure 1 displays ECV values across time. Despite
some minor fluctuation in magnitude, p explained
the vast majority of variance at all time points
(.60­.71) (Reise et al., 2013; Reise & Revicki, 2014).
Of the three specific factors, internalizing
explained the most additional variance at each time
point (.14­.25). The attention factor explained little
overall variance (.04­.06). Overall, ECV values did
not consistently exceed .70, suggesting that
although p explained the majority of variance, the
specific factors explained a nontrivial amount of
variance across time (Rodriguez et al., 2016).
Phenotypic stability
Standardized regression coefficients based on latent
factor scores are presented in Figure 2. All autore-
gressive (i.e., homotypic) effects were statistically
significant. These autoregressive effects were con-
sistently largest for p (b = .52­.76), with effects for
specific factors ranging from small to moderate
(b = .23­.55). Externalizing and attention evidenced
the least phenotypic stability. This may have been
partly due to their lower levels of construct reliability
(H) (Hancock & Mueller, 2001).
Notably, a large number of cross-lagged effects
were statistically significant, although these were
considerably weaker than the homotypic autoregres-
sive effects (b = .06­.25). Nevertheless, consistent
patterns emerged. Internalizing and externalizing
frequently had negative associations across time
(b = À.10 to À.19). p positively predicted the three
specific factors at varying points across the time-
frame (b = .08­.25), while itself being predicted by
both internalizing (b = .06­.10) and externalizing
(b = .08­.17). To determine whether certain hetero-
typic paths were significantly stronger than others,
equality constraints were placed on pathways. A
Wald test indicated that there was a significant

difference between paths leading from internalizing
and externalizing to p, respectively (Wald test 2
(8) = 98.99, p < .01). Similarly, paths from p to
internalizing and externalizing were significantly
different (Wald test 2 (8) = 100.93, p < .01). Given
the larger standardized effect sizes between p
and externalizing, it appears these two factors were
more strongly associated over time than p and
internalizing.
Discussion
The present study sought to illuminate the structure
and developmental stability of psychopathology in a
cohort of children assessed repeatedly from very
early childhood to midadolescence. This research
was based on the p-factor approach to the modeling
of psychopathology, with a general bifactor account-
ing for the covariance between all psychopathologi-
cal symptoms (Caspi et al., 2014; Lahey et al.,
2012). Although p has repeatedly been discerned in
cross-sectional data, few studies have examined its
development. Investigating the longitudinal develop-
ment of general and specific dimensions of psy-
chopathology may lead to a better understanding of
the development of psychiatric disorders across the
life course. Furthermore, a better understanding of
the developmental processes that underlie p may
help establish an agreed-upon interpretation of this
factor, something that has so far proven elusive.

The present study examined two forms of develop-
mental stability, strength consistency, and pheno-
typic stability, in an attempt to determine whether
the development of p was characterized by either
dynamic mutualism or p-differentiation. With regard
to consistency in strength, both p and the specific
factors explained very consistent proportions of
variance across time, with p explaining the majority
of shared variance at all time points. These findings
are in line with those of Murray et al. (2016). The fact
that the amount of variance accounted for by p and
the specific factors did not change over time seems
inconsistent with both p-differentiation and dynamic
mutualism, as they hypothesize respectively,
increasing and decreasing relative contributions of
p to symptom variance across time. It must be noted,
however, that p was derived from cross-sectional
data at each time point in the present study and that
of Murray et al. (2016), meaning each p factor
represented the variance attributable to comorbidity,
in whatever form that took, at a particular age. In
simple terms, p was used to capture all comorbidity
at a given age, although the underlying meaning of p
may vary developmentally.
Heterotypic continuity was notably evident, even if
it was less common and weaker than homotypic
continuity. The presence of heterotypic continuity
suggests significant individual-level change in the
phenotypic expression of psychopathology. Overall,
p appeared to lie at the heart of heterotypic conti-
nuity, with almost all positive heterotypic effects
feeding into or emerging from p. For example, p
predicted all three specific factors at subsequent
time points, and was itself predicted at future time
points at least once by earlier measurements of both
externalizing and internalizing. This suggests that
specific manifestations of psychopathology led to
increased risk of comorbid psychopathology (i.e., p)
over time, and vice versa. This would seem to
contradict the previous claim that neither dynamic
mutualism nor p-differentiation characterizes the
development of psychopathology. Indeed, the data
suggest that both developmental processes may be
operating concurrently, possibly cancelling each
other out when using the relative amount of variance
explained as a measure of stability (e.g., Murray
et al., 2016). Put simply, there may be certain
individuals for whom symptoms become more speci-
fic over time (i.e., p ? internalizing, externalizing, or
attention), whereas others experience more comor-
bidity (internalizing, externalizing, or attention ? p),
and still others who experience both processes.
Having raised the aforementioned possibilities, a
closer examination of the individual effects observed
herein would seem in line with previous studies
using person-centered methodologies, which further
support the idea that both processes, p-differentia-
tion and dynamic mutualism, may occur simultane-
ously. For example, person-centered studies have
identified unique classes that describe patterns of
co-occurring symptomatology both cross-sectionally
(Vaidyanathan, Patrick, & Iacono, 2011) and longi-
tudinally through childhood (Patalay, Moulton,
Goodman, & Ploubidis, 2017). Recent research
investigating transitions between these cross-sec-
tional classes over time indicate that transitions
between `pure' psychopathological classes (e.g., pre-
dominantly internalizing or externalizing) and
comorbid classes are relatively common, with tran-
sitions more often observed to and from comorbid
and predominantly externalizing classes (Basten
et al., 2016; Kim & Eaton, 2017; McElroy, Shevlin,
& Murphy, 2017; Willner, Gatzke-Kopp, & Bray,
2016). The findings of the present variable-centered
study mirror these results; externalizing and p
demonstrated stronger reciprocal relationships over
time than internalizing and p. Indeed, it appears that
those who score high on p initially could potentially
develop more specific psychopathology in any of the
three specific domains. Those with more externaliz-
ing problems at baseline, however, appear more
likely to develop comorbid internalizing symptoms
over time, whereas the converse is less likely. This is
very much in line with cascade models, which have
highlighted the role of externalizing in the develop-
ment of subsequent co-occurring internalizing prob-
lems (Capaldi, 1992; Masten & Cicchetti, 2010).
To date, only two other investigations have exam-
ined the phenotypic stability of general and specific
factors of psychopathology, with both chronicling
strong homotypic continuity but not heterotypic
continuity (Greene & Eaton, 2017; Snyder et al.,
2016). It must be noted, however, that Greene and
Eaton (2017) utilized an adult sample, for which a
greater degree of phenotypic stability would be
expected compared with samples of children/ado-
lescents. Furthermore, both studies assessed psy-
chopathology at only two time points, with a limited
amount of time between assessments. The present
investigation discerned heterotypic continuity over
multiple time points, across a period of significant
development. As such, it indicates that processes
such as p-differentiation and/or dynamic mutualism
are more pronounced earlier in development.
Strengths and limitations
A major strength of the present study was the large
developmental range covered, from very early child-
hood to midadolescence. Early and middle childhood
are dynamic periods of the life span, involving
significant biological, cognitive, and social change,
and it is well-established that psychopathology in
childhood is a precursor to mental ill-health in
adulthood (Kessler et al., 2007). With regard to
limitations, first it must be noted that the present
study relied solely on maternal reports across all
assessment waves, however, proxy reports are con-
sidered necessary in early childhood. It is worth
noting that when children become old enough to self-

report, cross-informant agreement has generally
been low (Waters, Stewart-Brown, & Fitzpatrick,
2003). Second, while the sample used in the present
study was large and diverse, it was not nationally
representative. Third, due to the computational
complexity of the tested model, the preferred method
of employing a single longitudinal structural equa-
tion model was not possible. The implemented `two-
step' approach has some weaknesses (e.g., smaller
standard errors, biased estimates) (DiStefano, Zhu,
& Mindrila, 2009). Finally, as previously mentioned,
the longitudinal invariance of p was not tested in the
present study, meaning p in this case reflected only a
broad statistical summary of comorbidity across
internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems.
Conclusion
The current study highlights the utility of a general
factor as a method for capturing psychopathological
comorbidity and investigating the role that comor-
bidity plays in the development of mental illness.
Contrary to prior research, the findings demon-
strated that p-differentiation and dynamic mutual-
ism are both plausible mechanisms by which
psychopathology develops over time. It is possible
that there are specific pathways experienced by
different individuals across development. Further
studies implementing both variable-centered and
person-centered techniques may be required to
better illuminate these developmental pathways,
differentiate those who experience them, and exam-
ine the outcomes associated with each.

Key points
· Research suggests that a bifactor model comprised of a general bifactor and specific factors effectively
captures psychiatric comorbidity across development, yet the developmental stability of these factors remains
under-researched.
· Confirmatory bifactor modeling demonstrated that this model fit well in a cohort of children assessed
between ages 2 and 14 years, with the general factor accounting for the vast majority of symptom covariation.
· Cross-lagged modeling indicated that this general factor temporally predicted and was predicted by specific
factors.
· Psychopathological comorbidity may become increasingly/decreasingly distinct over time, or demonstrate
intermittent periods of both.
