Abstract
Care of the elderly with dementia represents one of the major challenges for the modern society worldwide. The burden of
dementia care often falls on the family members, entailing heavy psychosocial and economic consequences. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the caregiver's perspective concerning the support for disease management on behalf of the physicians and the
local Sicilian administrations (Italy), and the burden of care and effects on their lifestyle, to propose new prevention strategies
and service for managing dementia and caregiver's burden. Fifty-nine caregivers of Italian elderly people with dementia (mean
age, 73; age range: 63-83) were interviewed, and 55 of them completed an ad hoc self-report questionnaire composed of 54
multiple-choice questions. Our findings suggest that caregivers need more information on the disease's management, as well as
on how to deal with the stress due to the disease burden. Moreover, a negative perception about the services offered from the
local administration emerged. Assistive technology (AT) could be useful in promoting interaction between general practitioners
and specialized centers for diagnosis, pharmacological and psychosocial treatments, and in saving costs. Moreover, case manager
could follow patients and support family members within the care pathway, besides collecting and sharing information among the
different health professionals involved. Further studies should be aimed at investigating whether AT and/or the use of specific
educational strategies could be the right approach for meeting the needs of families living with dementia.

Original Research
Introduction
Dementia includes a wide range of brain diseases character-
ized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. It has been
estimated that about 47 million people worldwide suffer
from dementia, and this number is expected to reach 75 mil-
lion by 2030.1 In Italy, dementia affects approximately 1 mil-
lion elderly people, including 7.23% of the population aged
65 years or above, and the number of carers is about 3 mil-
lion.2 Given the continuous growth of incidence of this ill-
ness, especially in elderly often affected by other chronic
diseases, dementia represents one of the major plagues for
the modern society. As the disease progresses, a host of
symptoms can emerge, such as disorientation, mood swings,
confusion, more serious memory loss, behavioral changes,
difficulties in speaking and swallowing, and problems with
walking. Thus, dementia interferes with daily, social and
professional functioning of patients, also affecting the daily
life of their families.3
From an epidemiological point of view, in Europe only
50% of the elderly receive a diagnosis of dementia by a spe-
cialized center and this often occurs when the patient is
already in a moderate stage of the disease.4
But, a timely diagnosis can facilitate care and support
patients and their families to take control of their situation.4,5
Moreover, interventions focused on modifiable risk factors,
if provided earlier in life, might be promising preventive
actions,6,7 reducing between 1.1 and 3 million cases of
Alzheimer disease (AD).8

2 INQUIRY
The worldwide economic costs of dementia were esti-
mated to be more than $600 billion in 2010,9 and $818 bil-
lion in 2015,1 a substantial economic impact for a single
group of disorders. Globally, 87% of the direct costs occur in
high-income countries, mainly in strategies, to compensate
lost function rather than treatment for prevention.3 Indirect
costs, due to informal care, include the estimation of the
amount of lost work productivity and the costs to pay a pro-
fessional caregiver to reduce the time spent on caregiving
tasks.10 In addition to direct and indirect costs, there are the
intangible costs of reduced quality of life of both patient and
familiars. Indeed, informal care is the most important form
of care in many countries, especially when dedicated health
care services (home care, nursing homes, and daycare) are
almost inexistent.11 In Italy, as across all European countries,
it is the relatives who predominantly manage AD patients,
and the main out-of-pocket expenditure borne by the Italian
relatives concerns the cost of private care workers
(13590/y). In 2015, the societal burden ofAD, composed of
public, patient, and informal care costs, was about 20000/y;
out of this, the cost borne by the public sector was 4534/y,
mainly for the national cash-for-care allowance (2324/y)
and drug prescriptions (1402/y).12
Care for a familiar affects the working life of the care-
giver, who may be compelled to opt for part-time or leave the
job13; for this reason, the informal caregivers are mainly
women, usually spouses, but also daughters or daughters-in-
law. However, the increasing employment rates for women is
clashing with their availability in providing informal care for
familiars with dementia.14
Within this context, assistive technology (AT) may lead to
possible cost savings in care delivery. Indeed, ad hoc tech-
nologies could be used for monitoring people with dementia
(PWD), facilitating access to health care services, and pro-
moting interaction with general practitioners.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of
southern Italy families dealing with dementia about services
received by the local Sicilian administration, general practi-
tioners, and neurologists of our specialized center. We also
investigated on the psychosocial problems perceived by car-
ers of elderly PWD, to propose new prevention strategies
and service for managing dementia and caregiver's burden.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
All the eligible caregivers of the patients referred for demen-
tia to IRCCS Centro Neurolesi "Bonino-Pulejo" of Messina
were asked to complete a questionnaire during a period of 4
weeks in May 2015. Fifty-nine participants (32 females and
27 males) completed the questionnaire after having signed a
written informed consent. Four questionnaires were excluded
because missing data did not allow further analysis. Thus,
the study population consisted of 55 caregivers aged 21 to 85
years (mean age: 53.04 ± 14.21 years), who cared for patients
having a mean age of 72.94 ± 9.59 years. Table 1 shows in
detail the demographic characteristics of both patients and
caregivers. The study was approved by our IRCCS Local
Ethical Committee (Ref. No. 13/2016). To secure privacy
and anonymity of participants, we used study codes on data
documents (ie, completed questionnaire) instead of record-
ing participants' identifying information, which were con-
versely kept in a separate document where codes and
identifying information were matched/linked. This docu-
ment was locked in a separate location, and the access to it
was restricted to the principal investigator of the study.
Data Collection
Caregiver perspective was assessed by a self-report Italian
questionnaire composed of 54 multiple-choice questions (see
the appendix), created ad hoc by the authors, that evaluates
the personal perception about three main issues: (1) support
for disease management from physicians and local adminis-
trations, (2) effects of the disease on the caregiver lifestyle,
and (3) caregiver burden. As the main purpose of this study
was to know whether patients and caregivers felt abandoned
in disease management, especially by the local administra-
tion and the health system, as well as to observe the caregiv-
ers' lifestyle to conceive potential strategies suitable for the
situation, we did not use any standardized scale or test.
However, we included, within the questionnaire, a set of
questions aimed at evaluating the caregiver burden. These
included emotions, behaviors, and problems perceived by
the caregiver. The questionnaire included another 10 items
aimed to collect demographical information on both the
patient and caregiver.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by using the 3.2.3 version
of the open-source software R.15 A P value <.05 was consid-
ered as statistically significant.
Results for continuous variables were expressed in mean
± standard deviation, whereas categorical variables were
expressed in frequencies and percentages. Initially, a bivari-
ate statistical analysis was performed to investigate on care-
givers'lifestyle and disease management, aside from support
provided by physicians and local administrations. Thus, cor-
relations between quantitative variables were computed by
Pearson coefficient, or by point-biserial correlation coeffi-
cient when one variable was dichotomous. The chi-square
test or the Fisher exact test were used for proportion com-
parison, and the Student t test was used to compare the mean
age by gender, as well as the frequency of medical examina-
tion by the general practitioner and the neurologist. Next, we
also conducted a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)
on the last 24 questions of the questionnaire concerning care-
giver burden and help in disease management. The analysis
De Cola et al 3
of the MCA was carried out with regard to the correlations
between the variables and the factorial axes.
Results
Sociodemographic Aspects and Health of the
Sample
As shown in Table 1, the caregivers were mainly graduated
(47.27%), as compared with patients, who were poorly
educated. About 65% of the patients were married and
25.45% widowed, whereas caregivers were principally
married (69.09%). More than half of caregivers cared for
their parents (54.54%), who were mainly pensioners or
housewives. We found that female caregivers were slightly
younger than males (t = -1.74, df = 47, P < .05). No other
significant differences by gender emerged. However, we
found a significant association between gender and job (P
< .01): Women were mainly housewives (36.67%) or
unemployed (23.33%), whereas men were mainly pen-
sioned (40%) or office makers (28%). On the contrary,
32.73% declared having to interrupt their working activity
(12.72% definitively) to take care of their own loved-one
(Table 2, Q13).

4 INQUIRY
A substantial percentage of caregivers (80%) lived with
the patients (Table 2, Q18): 32.73% declared of having to
move in with their loved-one after the diagnosis of dementia,
whereas 47.27% already lived with him or her.
Fifty out of 55 patients (90.9%) suffered from at least one
chronic disease, and in particular, 35 out of 55 patients had at
least three chronic diseases (Q29). Hypertension (49.2%),
arthrosis (47.4%), and anxiety and depression (45.6%) were
the most common. Moreover, 27.27% of the caregivers were
married to the patients, and 52.78% of them, in turn, suffered
from at least one chronic disease (Q30).
Support to the Patients' Management
Patients went to their general practitioner (Q1) more often than
to the neurologist (Q4; t = 3.9, df = 31, P < .001), and in 92.73%
of the cases, neurologists provided clear information about the
disease, versus 65.45% of the general practitioner (Table 2, Q5
and Q3, respectively). However, 40% of caregivers declared of
not having received suggestions on how to manage the famil-
iar's disease (Table 2, Q6) and 80% of them of not having
received suggestions on how to deal with the burden (Table 2,
Q8).Around 46% of the patients had only one caregiver (Q14),
apparently because he or she was the most appropriate (40%),
or because others had no time (28%; Q16).
Only 14.55% of caregivers declared of having received an
economical or material (eg, health aid) support from local
administration, and 21.82% an attendance allowance (Table 2,
Q11 and Q10, respectively). However, 78.18% of the caregiv-
ers declared that the disease had affected the family's econom-
ical balance (Table 2, Q28). Indeed, 85.85% found the national
and local administration support inadequate (Table 2, Q12).
Caregiver Lifestyle and Burden
Concerning lifestyle, although 50.91% of caregivers were
motorized (Table 2, Q27), they spent their free time mainly
watching TV and listening to the radio (67.27%; Table 2,
Q23), as well as reading books and newspapers (50.91%;
Table 2, Q22). Around 53% of the caregivers did not attend
meeting places (Table 2, Q21), and 36.37% did not see
friends (Table 2, Q20). However, 49.09% attempt to regu-
larly cultivate a hobby (Table 2, Q25). On the other hand, we
think the caregivers' free time was inversely correlated with
their difficulty to manage anger (r = -0.25), and with the
caregivers' perception that their loved-ones were perceived
as a "weight" (r = -0.31). Similarly, the number of caregiv-
ers was moderately correlated to their guilty for leaving the
familiar alone (r = 0.32). However, only 7.27% of caregivers
declared to use psychiatric drugs (Table 2, Q19).
Multiple Correspondence Analysis
The results of the MCA conducted on the last 24 questions
supported our idea about the caregivers' burden and stress
(Table 3). Indeed, the first factorial axis, which accounts for
23.61% of total inertia, can be considered as the axis of the
caregiver's burden, because it correlated highly with many
questions concerning the emotional management of the care-
givers. They felt stressed (Q50; r = 0.79), not able to deal
with their problems (Q49; r = 0.74), angry (Q51; r = 0.69)
especially with himself (Q47; r = 0.78), and sometimes they
felt the wish to escape from the situation (Q45; r = 0.79).
On the other hand, the second factorial axis (10.42% of
total inertia) could be considered as the axis of need for help
in disease management. Indeed, this axis correlated highly
with the caregivers' desire in receiving additional informa-
tion about the disease (Q33; r = 0.69), their necessity to have
advice on how to assist their loved-one (Q36; r = 0.69), and
their quarrels for care management with other family mem-
bers (Q37; r = 0.59).
Overall, caregivers wish to have more time for themselves
(Q35; r = 0.56 and r = 0.40, respectively).
Discussion
According to literature, the care and support provided for
PWD often cover several areas of their lives.3 Typical
health care delivery structures usually do not pay much
attention to this support, with an enormous impact on the

whole family, ranging from the caring burden to the psy-
chosocial and economic aspects.
Familiars are physically, emotionally, and financially
involved by the disease, and the burden has a significant
impact on their physical and mental health, personal and
social life, and overall well-being.16 In our sample, around
60% of the caregivers declared the necessity of having
more information on the disease's management (Table 2,
Q7), and 61.82% on how to deal with the disease caring-
related stress (Table 2, Q9). According to previous works,
caregivers sustain an ever-increasing burden of care in the
management of patients associated with progression of
dementia. They spend many hours in supporting the patient
in direct care activities (personal hygiene, preparation and
serving of meals, dispensing of drugs and medications,
care and support) and surveillance, which imply a gradual
reorganization of their lives. Indeed, spaces and roles
required assisting the patient expose the entire family to
stress and pressures that threaten to destabilize, even dra-
matically, their "equilibrium."17 Thus, conflicts secondary
to fatigue and economic or psychological problems may
frequently emerge. The variability of the patient's behavior
increases caregiver's disorientation and sense of fragility
and helplessness. Furthermore, an increasing risk of coro-
nary heart disease and mortality for caregivers have been
found in previous studies.18,19
In this study, we found that caregivers experienced a
stress condition related to dementia. MCA results showed
that caregivers were not capable of emotional manage-
ment, with regard to anxiety, anger, and frustration; fur-
thermore, bivariate analysis highlighted relationship
problems and social isolation. In particular, difficulty in
anger management was associated with a decrease in the
time spent on their own needs (r = -0.25). Moreover,
47.27% of caregivers declared a sense of guilt. Notably,
the most important aspect that we want to underline is the
caregivers' perception of the inadequate service offered
from the local government: Only 14.55% of families
received an economical or material (eg, health aid) sup-
port, whereas 78.18% of the caregivers declared that the
disease management affected the family budget. These
participants declared they needed more support from local
and national governments to manage all the aspects
involved in dementia. However, the notable contribution
provided by familiars is a benefit for the health care sys-
tem, in terms of cost-effectiveness advantages.20
In this scenario, strategies to bridge the gap between
patient demands and their families and the public health
care system are crucial for the quality of care.21 Thus,
political strategies should be integrated with voluntary and
private organizations to create an environment able to meet
patients' needs, in terms not only of care (eg, eating, dress-
ing, and hygiene) but also supporting psychosocial and
existential needs. Similarly, programs for case manage-
ment, counseling, daycare, and education by different care
providers, as well as interventions for helping familiars to
manage the personal burden of caring, need to be devel-
oped. Indeed, many studies showed that support for family
members and other caregivers can represent a valuable
cost-effective use of resources,22,23 reducing or postponing
nursing-home admissions,24,25 and improving psychologi-
cal caregivers' conditions.26,27 Moreover, by providing bet-
ter training for dementia care, healthcare services will
improve the global quality of care, also reducing the grow-
ing necessity of future costs.
AT can improve the quality of life and cut down on
health care costs. Alarms, GPSs, watches, smartphones,
and so forth could be used for monitoring PWD, facilitat-
ing access to health care services, and promoting interac-
tion with general practitioners. After all, PWD have
demonstrated a positive response to AT use, but if and
when this can facilitate autonomy and independence
nobody knows.28,29 Moreover, it has been shown that tele-
medicine can be considered as an important tool for
improving health, cognitive function, and quality of life in
the elderly living in nursing homes.30,31 AT for carers
could also be useful in "caregivers' empowerments,"32 as

well as in reducing their burden.33,34 Telehealth systems
could play a pivotal role for both the families living with
dementia and health care administrations in a cost-effec-
tive approach, avoiding the unnecessary hospital admis-
sions,35 which have been estimated to be about 40% higher
in PWD and/or cognitive impairment than in the elderly
without deficit.36 Thus, general practitioners could use AT
to promote interventions targeting multiple modifiable
factors and to bridge the gap between families and spe-
cialist centers to provide a timely diagnosis of dementia.
In fact, general practitioners often perceive a failure in
traditional care, declaring the need for routine provision
of medication dose decision aids.37 Similarly, case man-
agement may offer potential benefit to patients, their care-
givers, and community-based professionals through
continuity of care with a trusted and qualified individual,
who can address the needs of the families living with
dementia.38 Although it is not possible to rate whether
case management could delay institutionalization in care
homes or can be successfully incorporated into routine
general practice,39,40 it could have a place within initia-
tives for health and social services integration. Indeed, the
case manager could follow the patients within a specialist
local care network, supporting the familiars in the disease
management, and collecting and sharing information
among the different health professionals.
The dependence on the participants' subjective assess-
ments/self-report, and the absence of objective measures
incorporated to support the participants' subjective
responses may be considered the main limitations of this
work. Nonetheless, no standardized scales or tests exist to
estimate how patients and caregivers perceive the local
administration and the health system services in dementia
support care.
Conclusions
Territorial health care systems do not pay much attention
to the care of PWD. Consequently, the burden of dementia
often is supported by the family members. To meet the
needs of PWD and their carers is a challenge that has to be
addressed as an important part of clinical decision mak-
ing. Thus, there is a growing need to have local and
national policy strategies in a multidisciplinary care pro-
gram management, with the organization of a network
linking specialist centers for diagnosis and pharmacologi-
cal and psychosocial treatments, general practitioners,
sheltered housing facilities, integrated home care, and
nursing homes. Implementation of a guideline and new
national and local policy strategies for dementia care are
therefore necessary to fulfill such a necessity. Thus, fur-
ther studies should be fostered to investigate whether AT
and/or the use of specific educational interventions could
be the right approach to better meet the needs of families
living with dementia.
