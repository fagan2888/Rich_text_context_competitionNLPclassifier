Validity of Self-reported Diagnoses Leading to Hospitalization: A
Comparison of Self-reports with Hospital Records in a Prospective
Study of American Adults
Manuela M. Bergmann,1 Tim Byers,2 David S. Freedman,2 and Ali Mokdad2
The authors compared interview reports with hospitalization records of participants in a nationally representative
survey to determine the accuracy of self-reports of ischemic heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, ulcers,
cataract, hip fracture, colon polyps, and cancers of the colon, breast, prostate, and lung. The study cohort
consisted of 10,523 participants from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1971-1975 who
were aged 25-74 years at the baseline examination and who completed a follow-up interview in 1982-1984.
Serf-reports of hospitalization for breast cancer were confirmed as accurate for 100% of cases where a hospital
record was available. Self-report accuracy was also high for ischemic heart disease (84%), cataract (83%), and hip
fracture (81 %); it was moderate for lung cancer (78%), prostate cancer (75%), gallbladder disease (74%), colon
cancer (71%), and stroke (67%); but it was low for ulcers (54%) and colon polyps (32%). Some of the self-reports
of ulcers (20%), hip fracture (9%), ischemic heart disease (7%), and stroke (7%) were found to reflect diagnoses of
other conditions of anatomic proximity. Accuracy of self-reports improved with higher levels of education, but was
not generally related to age, gender, race, alcohol use, or smoking. The results suggest that self-reports of some
diseases can be taken as accurate, but self-reports of other conditions might require medical record verification in
epidemiotogic follow-up studies. Am J Epidemiol 1998; 147:969-77.

Employing self-reports of major illnesses and health
events is the most practical method of assessing dis-
ease status in large prospective studies. However, the
quality and accuracy of self-reports may vary by type
of illness (1, 2), age, education, time since diagnosis,
and method of interviewing (3-6). For example, in a
prospective study of elderly women, in self-reporting
fractures, those participants who graduated from col-
lege were more accurate than those with less education
(4). The accuracy of self-reported age at menopause in
the Nurses' Health Study (3) was higher among nurses
who had undergone surgical menopause and lower
among nurses with a relatively longer elapsed time
from menopause. Previous studies (1-5) have shown
that people can accurately recall various cancers and
fractures (4, 5, 7), but recall is less accurate for myo-

cardial infarction and stroke (7). Interviewing tech-
niques, such as probing, improve the validity of self-
reports of previous health conditions (6). However,
further investigation is needed to assess potential bi-
ases in ascertaining outcomes in epidemiologic obser-
vational studies relying on self-reports of medical con-
ditions (8, 9).
To assess the potential bias in ascertaining outcome
in observational studies through serf-reports, we ex-
amined differences in the true-positive rate of self-
reported hospital diagnoses of several chronic diseases
in a representative sample of American adults. We
also examined whether various respondent character-
istics, such as age, race, gender, education, alcohol
consumption, and smoking status, might affect the
validity of self-reports.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The First National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES I) was conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics in collaboration with
other US Public Health Service agencies from 1971 to
1975. NHANES I was based on a representative sam-
969
970 Bergmann et al.
pie of Americans aged 1-74 years. Four waves of
follow-up have been completed, in 1982-1984, 1986,
1987, and 1992. We obtained study data from the first
wave of the First National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey Epidemiologic Followup Study
(NHEFS). The design and the methods of NHEFS
have been published elsewhere (10). The follow-up
included a personal interview of participants in which
they were asked whether they had ever had certain
diseases and whether they had been hospitalized for
these diseases subsequent to 1970. Interview data were
obtained for 91 percent of the individuals (n -- 12,220)
who were successfully traced from the NHANESI and
who were aged 25-74 years at baseline examination.
We excluded 1,697 individuals from our study for
whom information had been provided by a proxy
(where the subject was deceased or incapacitated)
because of differences in the accuracy of proxy pro-
vided data compared with self-reports (4, 11). Thus,
our final study cohort comprised 10,523 participants.
Interview
The NHEFS investigators collected information on
more than 40 conditions (see Appendix); 11 of these
conditions that we thought would represent a range of
types of serious illnesses were chosen for analysis.
These conditions include ischemic heart disease (heart
attack and angina), stroke (including small stroke
(transient ischemic attack) and cerebrovascular acci-
dent), gallbladder disease, ulcers of the stomach or
duodenum, cataract, hip fracture, colon polyps, and
cancers of the colon, breast, prostate, and lung.
For each disease, interviewers collected information
on the occurrence, the year it first occurred, whether
the subject had been hospitalized for that disease since
1970, and the name of the facility where the subject
was hospitalized. Participants were asked: "Did a doc-
tor ever tell you that you had. . . ?" If participants
answered "yes" they were then asked: "In what year
were you first told that you had this condition?" and,
"Since 1970, have you been hospitalized overnight for
this condition?" Only those subjects who reported they
were first told about the condition by a doctor between
the NHANES I examination in 1971-1975 and the
NHEFS interview in 1982-1984 were included in this
analysis. In all, 2,603 participants (25 percent) re-
ported having one or more of the 11 study conditions,
and 1,561 (15 percent) reported being hospitalized for
one or more of these conditions during the relevant
time period.
Hospital records
NHEFS researchers tried to obtain complete records
from all hospitals and nursing homes reported by the
participants. Each participant reporting admission to a
hospital or nursing home was requested to sign a form
authorizing the health care facility to release the re-
quired information. The facility staff were asked to
abstract all discharge diagnoses and procedures onto a
special form and to identify the principal diagnosis.
Usually, the facility attached a copy of the hospital or
nursing home discharge summary or the medical
record face sheet to the abstract. Before entering the
information into the NHEFS database, the abstract
form was compared with the discharge summary or
face sheet. Discrepancies between the diagnosis on the
abstract form and the face sheet or discharge summary
were resolved in favor of the latter two documents.
Diagnoses on each hospital or nursing home record
were coded using the International Classification of
Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-
CM) (12). As many as 10 diagnoses for each overnight
stay from the abstract form, discharge summary, or
face sheet were entered into the database. Records
were not obtained for 214 (11 percent) of the 1,880
reported overnight stays because the participant re-
fused to sign the consent form, the hospital refused or
was not able to respond, or the hospital had no record
of a stay.
Data analysis
We compared the interview responses about hospi-
talization for the 11 self-reported conditions with all
the diagnoses provided by the health care facilities.
Each self-report for which at least one hospital record
was available (n = 1,666) was categorized as a true
positive or a false positive. We defined true positive as
an exact match of the participant's self-reported hos-
pitalized condition with one of the available hospital
or nursing home diagnoses, whereas we defined a
self-report as false positive if the hospital or nursing
home diagnoses did not match the self-reported con-
dition. We also did not accept diagnoses which were
closely related, primarily due to anatomic proximity,
or which matched the self-report but were labeled as
"probable" or "possible" on the hospital report. The
Appendix table lists the ICD-9-CM codes correspond-
ing to the conditions we studied as well as the closely
related diagnoses.
The true-positive rate measures the probability for a
self-reported hospitalization diagnosis to be confirmed
by hospital or nursing home records. The 95 percent
confidence interval for each true-positive rate was
calculated. Since the NHEFS requested information
only from those health care facilities named by indi-
viduals reporting a hospitalization, we were unable to
estimate the true-negative rate of self-reports (the
probability that a hospitalization for a condition was,

in fact, absent when the subject did not report the
hospitalization).
Stratified analysis of true-positive rates for each
condition by gender and by levels of race, age, edu-
cation, alcohol consumption, and smoking were cal-
culated. Because of the small numbers, all four cancers
were combined into one cancer category for this anal-
ysis. We categorized age at the time of the 1982-1984
follow-up interview as less than 50 years, 50-64
years, or older than 64 years. Years of formal educa-
tion were classified as less than 10 years, 10-12 years,
more than 12 years, and not ascertained. We catego-
rized race as white, nonwhite, and not ascertained.
Alcohol drinking during the past year at baseline was
classified as never drinking alcohol, drinking less than
one time per month, drinking one time per month to
three times per week, drinking more than three times
per week, and not ascertained. We defined smoking at
baseline based on information from the NHANES I
interview supplemented by retrospective self-reports
in 1982-1984, using the categories of never smoker,
former smoker, current smoker, and not ascertained
(13).
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic for general
association (14-17) was used to assess differences in
self-reported conditions and hospitalizations across
strata of age and across strata of gender, race, educa-
tion, alcohol drinking, and smoking adjusting for age.
Because of the large sample size, p values of <0.001
were considered to be significant. Differences in the
true-positive rates for each condition across strata of
the sociodemographic and behavior variables, adjust-
ing for each other, were estimated, considering p val-
ues of <0.05 to be significant.
RESULTS
The larger proportion of the study participants who
reported at least one condition were aged 65 years or
older and were white. The percentage of individuals
reporting overnight stays in health care facilities dif-
fered by age and years of formal education, but not
by gender, race, alcohol consumption, or smoking
(table 1).
Older participants, males, and former smokers
tended to report ischemic heart disease, as well as
hospitalization for that condition, more frequently.
The proportion of self-reports with increasing formal
years of education, and the proportion of self-reported
overnight stays in a facility, for ischemic heart disease
decreased across strata defined by years of formal
education (data not shown). A higher proportion of
women than men reported that they had been diag-
nosed with gallbladder disease and hip fracture. The
percentage of self-reported ulcers, and hospitalization
for ulcers, were higher among current smokers than
former smokers and nonsmokers (data not shown).
The conditions reported most frequently were cata-
racts, ischemic heart disease, gallbladder disease, and
ulcers of the stomach and duodenum (table 2). The
availability of medical records ranged from 80 percent
(prostate cancer) to 92 percent (stroke, ulcers, and
breast cancer). Cerebrovascular accident, hip fracture,
and cancers were the least frequently reported condi-
tions in the study population, but had the highest
proportion of hospitalizations (greater than 90 per-
cent). Three-fourths of the individuals reporting ische-
mic heart disease or gallbladder disease reported they
had been hospitalized, whereas 59 percent reporting
colon polyps, 37 percent reporting ulcers, and just 31
percent reporting cataracts reported a hospitalization
for these conditions.
True-positive rates for self-reports of hospitalization
because of a particular condition ranged from 32 per-
cent for colon polyps to 100 percent for breast cancer
(table 2). The true-positive rates for ischemic heart
disease, myocardial infarction, cataract, hip fracture,
and breast cancer were all greater than 80 percent. A
small proportion of self-reports (0-4 percent) were
labeled false positive because the diagnosis on the
hospital or nursing home chart was expressed as
"probable" or "possible". Nonmatching but closely
related diagnoses accounted for 7 percent of self-
reported hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease
and stroke, for 20 percent of self-reported ulcers, and
for 29 percent of self-reported colon polyps. Between
about one-fourth and one-third of self-reported hospi-
talizations for colon polyps, colon cancer, gallbladder
disease, ulcers, prostate and lung cancer, and stroke
were defined as false positives because of unrelated
diagnoses. A comparable low proportion (9-13 per-
cent) of unrelated diagnoses was observed for self-
reported hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease,
hip fracture, and cataract.
The percentage of true-positive self-reports of cer-
tain diseases varied by gender, age, and race (table 3).
Self-reports by women of hospitalization for gallblad-
der disease were more likely to be true positive than
self-reports by men (77 percent versus 65 percent).
True-positive rates for ischemic heart disease, stroke,
and ulcers were higher in the older age ranges. Self-
reports of colon polyps by nonwhite participants were
more likely to be true positive than those by whites (86
percent versus 29 percent). Participants with more
than 12 years of formal education were more likely to
have a higher true-positive rate for colon polyps than
participants with less than 12 years of formal educa-
tion (45 percent versus 28 percent for participants with
10-12 years and 27 percent for participants with less

DISCUSSION
As we had expected, hospitalization rates varied
substantially among the 11 conditions we selected for
analysis, as did the validity of the self-reports. Almost
all individuals reporting hip fracture or cancer reported
hospitalization, but hospitalization was reported by
only a small percentage of those reporting ulcers,
cataracts, or colon polyps. The true-positive rate for
self-reports of hospitalization for ischemic heart dis-
ease (heart attack and angina combined) in our study
was 84 percent. Looking at self-reported hospitaliza-
tion for angina and for heart attack separately revealed
a high true-positive rate for self-reports of heart attack
but a low true-positive rate for angina. Other studies
(5, 7, 18, 19) have found true-positive rates of only
60-70 percent for myocardial infarction. Rosamond et
al. (19) revealed 40 percent of false-positive self-
reports of myocardial infarction being actually hospi-
taUzations for other heart disorders, primarily unstable
angina. Heart attack in our study frequently was mis-
reported as angina. Thirty-five percent of the false-
positive self-reports of angina in fact were myocardial
infarction or ischemic heart conditions. Our high true-
positive rate (81 percent) for hip fracture is consistent
with other studies: Paganini-Hill and Chao (5) re-
ported true-positive rates of 91 and 93 percent for
self-reports of hip fracture in two follow-ups of the
Leisure World Disease and Prevention Study. In a
study of osteoporotic fractures among 9,704 nonblack
women aged 65 years or older, Nevitt et al. (4) found
that 85 percent of self-reports of hip fracture were
verified by radiologic reports. Our high true-positive
rate (83 percent) for self-reports of hospitalization for

cataracts is similar to those reported by Linton et al.
(11) in the Beaver Dam Eye Study (81 percent for
telephone interviews, 84 percent for in-person inter-
views). The 74 percent true-positive rate for self-
reported hospitalization for gallbladder disease in the
present study was between the 82 percent found in a
1982 report (20) and the 68 percent found in an earlier
study (2).
Colon cancer had the lowest true-positive rate (71
percent) of the four cancers we studied. However, the
colon cancer finding may actually be an overestimate,
as we considered a diagnosis of cancer of the rectum
as verification of colon cancer. Earlier studies (5, 7)
have shown that when cancer sites are closely related
(e.g., colon and rectum), the accuracy of self-reports of
the specific anatomic site decreases. Our true-positive
rate of 78 percent for lung cancer reports is similar to
that reported in other studies; Colditz et al. (7) re-
ported in the Nurses' Health Study a true-positive rate
for self-reports of lung cancer of only 67 percent, and
Paganini-Hill and Chao (5) reported a true-positive
rate of 86-89 percent. Also, the 100 percent true-
positive rate for breast cancer in this study is consis-
tent with the 99 percent and 100 percent rates reported
by other investigators (5, 7). However, the true-
positive rate for prostate cancer self-reports of 75

percent in our study was lower than that reported in the
Leisure World Disease Prevention Study (93-100 per-
cent) (5).
We know of no recent studies that have reported
validation rates for self-report of ulcers or colon pol-
yps. In a 1973 report, Madow (2) found 60 percent
agreement between reports by personal interview and
medical records for ulcers of the stomach and duode-
num. Participants in our study reported a hospitaliza-
tion rate of only 37 percent for self-reported ulcers,
and we confirmed just 54 percent of these hospitaliza-
tions. Colon polyps also had a relatively low fre-
quency of hospitalization (59 percent), and only 32
percent of the self-reports of such hospitalizations
were confirmed. Thus, it appears that stomach and
duodenal ulcers and colon polyps (at least those that
result in a hospitalization) are not accurately self-
reported.
As have previous investigators (18, 19), we found
that a certain percentage of the false-positive self-
reports of ischemic heart disease involved diagnoses
of anatomic proximity such as acute pericarditis, myo-
carditis, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, diseases of the
pulmonary circulation, and hypertensive heart disease.
A considerable number of false-positive reports of
colon polyps also involved closely related hospital
diagnoses such as malignant neoplasm of the colon or
rectum. This confusion is obviously due to the word-
ing of the question: "Have you ever been told by a
doctor that you had polyps or tumor of the colon?"
This result illustrates how important it is to use unam-
biguous wording in inquiries. A considerable number
of false-positive stomach or duodenal ulcer reports had
a closely related hospital diagnosis, all of them for
gastritis or duodenitis. Our results may also indicate
that study participants might have focused only on part
of the information provided or might have been given
confusing information about the exact nature of their
conditions.
Very few researchers (2, 4) have examined the in-
fluence of sociodemographic or behavioral factors on
the accuracy of self-reports of illness. There were
some differences by gender, according to type of con-
dition, in the true-positive rates of the present study,
with higher true-positive rates for self-reports given by
women for hospitalization for gallbladder disease.
Furthermore, the present study found higher true-
positive rates for self-reports of ischemic heart dis-
ease, stroke, and ulcers given by participants aged 50
years and older. These differences might in large part
be due to a higher incidence of gallbladder disease
among women and a higher incidence of ischemic
heart disease, stroke, and ulcers among older age
groups. Madow (2), however, found that women were
slightly more likely than men to give false-positive
self-reports. The same study found no influence of
education. For participants of NHEFS with more than
12 years of education, however, the true-positive rate
was higher for self-reports of hospitalization for colon
polyps. Nevitt et al. (4) also observed a higher accu-
racy of self-reports of hip fracture when participants
were more highly educated.
One of the strengths of this analysis is that the
NHANES I participants were a nationally representa-
tive sample, and the NHEFS in 1982-1984 had a high
response rate (91 percent of targeted NHANES I par-
ticipants were successfully traced). The structure of
the interview in the NHEFS reduced the likelihood of
underreporting hospitalizations; each participant who
reported the occurrence of a disease was then asked

Validity of Self-reported Hospitalization Diagnoses 975
whether he/she had been hospitalized for that condi-
tion. Paganini-Hill and Chao (5) have pointed out that
the quality of reports of overnight stays in hospitals
increases when a generic question about hospitaliza-
tions is followed by questions related to specific dis-
eases. Furthermore, we defined a confirmed self-report
conservatively by excluding hospital diagnoses which
were labeled as "possible" or "probable". The validity
of self-reports for conditions not always leading to
hospitalization is an increasingly important area for
researchers, as many conditions are now being treated
only on an outpatient basis.
One of the strengths of our study was to examine the
accuracy of a self-report. Because there was no way to
screen records systematically from all hospitals, we
could not examine the issue of false-negative serf-
reports. Additionally, the true-positive rates in our
study reflected only the findings of agreement with
hospital records for cases in which a hospital record
was available. The results are valid for reports of
survivors since proxy reports for deceased or disabled
participants were excluded from the analysis.
In conclusion, we found self-reports of cancer of the
breast, hip fracture, cataract, ischemic heart disease,
and heart attack, respectively, to be accurate more than
80 percent of the time. True-positive rates were lower
for other conditions we examined, as low as 32 percent
for colon polyps. We conclude that investigators
should be aware that errors in the reporting of condi-
tions can create considerably more misclassification if
outcomes are based on self-reports only. Combining
self-reports of certain conditions with verification
against medical records will, therefore, be needed for
many outcomes in prospective cohort studies (21).
