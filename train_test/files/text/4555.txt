Results: Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 109/318 patients (34.28%); 124 isolates of 22
pathogenic bacterial species were identified, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.94%), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (16.94%), Acinetobacter baumannii (11.29%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.87%), and
Staphylococcus aureus (7.26%). S. aureus was sensitive to tigecycline, teicoplanin, vancomycin and
linezolid but resistant to penicillin and levofloxacin. K.pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii
and E. coli were susceptible to amikacin and cefoperazone.
Conclusions: K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are the most common pathogenic bacteria in
AECOPD cases in Beijing, China. Our antibiotic resistance findings may be helpful in selecting
antibiotic therapy.

Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) is a common chronic respiratory
illness worldwide1 and is characterized by
persistent airflow limitation that is usually
progressive.2 A large-scale epidemiological
survey carried out between 2002 and 2004
found the prevalence of COPD in adults in
China to be 8.2% (12.4% in men and 5.1%
in women).3 Acute exacerbation of COPD
(AECOPD) deteriorates pulmonary func-
tion and increases airway inflammation,4
and is a major cause of morbidity, mortality
and reduced health-related quality-of-life in
these patients.5 Guidelines produced by the
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive
Lung Disease (GOLD) take into account the
individual patient's history of exacerbations
when assessing symptomatology and risk of
poor outcome.6 Bacterial infection contrib-
utes to AECOPD,7­9 with 40­60% of
patients harbouring bacterial pathogens
during an acute exacerbation phase.10
Commonly isolated pathogens vary between
geographical regions, with Haemophilus
influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and
Streptococcus pneumoniae common in
Western countries,11 Klebsiella pneumoniae
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently
isolated in Taiwan,12 and H. influenzae and
P. aeruginosa in Hong Kong.13 To the best
of our knowledge, there have been no large
scale studies of bacterial infections in
AECOPD in Beijing, China, however.
Early antibiotic treatment of AEOCPD
can shorten recovery time, improve lung
function and reduce the risk of treatment
failure.6 Some studies have demonstrated
statistically significant improvements with
antibiotic therapy,14,15 although it is gener-
ally prescribed on a empirical basis.
Guidelines for antibiotic therapy of
AECOPD have been published,16 but these
cannot be applied on a worldwide basis due
to geographical variations in antibiotic sen-
sitivity and pathogen types. Antibiotic
resistance is increasingly problematic, and
judicious use of antibiotics is essential to
prevent the emergence of multidrug-resis-
tant bacteria. Information regarding anti-
microbial resistance patterns and
mechanisms will assist in determining the
best antibiotic regimens for AECOPD
treatment.
The aim of the present study was to
conduct an epidemiological survey on the
distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility
and drug resistance genes of bacteria iso-
lated from sputum samples of patients with
700 Journal of International Medical Research 43(5)
AECOPD from hospitals in Beijing, China,
to provide data that may contribute to
rational treatment and management of
AECOPD in this region.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective surveillance study recruited
patients hospitalized with AECOPD
between June 2013 and January 2014 in 11
general hospitals in Beijing, China (Chinese
PLA 304 Hospital, Chinese PLA 306
Hospital, Chinese PLA 307 Hospital,
Chinese PLA 309 Hospital, Chinese PLA
Navy General Hospital, Chinese PLA Air
Force General Hospital, Chinese PLA
Second Artillery General Hospital, Chinese
PLA General Hospital, Beijing Shijitan
Hospital, Beijing Electric Power Hospital,
Beijing Fengtai Hospital).
Diagnosis of COPD was based on GOLD
guidelines.6,13 AECOPD was considered if a
patient with background COPD presented
with an acute change of symptoms in at least
one of dyspnoea, cough and sputum pro-
duction.6,13 Exclusion criteria were: (i)
radiographic evidence of pneumonia; (ii)
diagnosis of other pulmonary disease (e.g.
bronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis,
asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, heart fail-
ure); (iii) exacerbation triggered by drugs,
asbestos, sulphur dioxide or another toxic
gas. Details of data collection procedures
are shown in Table 1.
The study was approved by the research
ethics committee of Chinese PLA General
Hospital and was undertaken according to
principles outlined in the Declaration of
Helsinki. All patients provided written
informed consent.
Sample collection and culture
Fresh sputum samples were collected in
sterile containers and processed as soon as

possible (within 2 h) according to standard
procedures by the designated microbio-
logical laboratory at each research institu-
tion.17 Sputum samples containing <10
epithelial cells and/or >25 leukocytes per
low-power field (Â100) were accepted for
subsequent analysis. At least two eligible
consecutive samples were obtained from
each participant. Sputum samples were
inoculated onto blood agar plates, chocolate
agar plates and Macconkey agar plates using
standard techniques, and incubated at 37C
in 5% carbon dioxide in air for 18­24 h.
Bacterial identification
Bacteria were identified via colony charac-
teristics and biochemical reactions using
standard microbiological methods or the
VITEKÕ 2 system (BioMe
´ rieux, Marcy
l'Etoile, France).18 Isolates of the same
species from the same patient were con-
sidered a single isolate. Nonpathogenic
micro-organisms including Neisseria,
Streptococcus viridans, Corynebacterium
and others were excluded from further
analyses.
Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified
via urinary pneumococcal antigen test
(BinaxNOWÕ S. pneumoniae Antigen
Card; Binax, Portland, ME, USA).
Serodiagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae
was performed using SerodiaÕ-Myco II
particle agglutination test (Fujirebio,
Tokyo, Japan), with titres !40 considered
positive. Both tests were performed accord-
ing to the manufacturers' instructions.
Antibiotic susceptibility
Antibiotics used in drug susceptibility tests
for Gram-negative bacteria included ampi-
cillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium,
piperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, cefox-
itin, ceftriaxone sodium, cefepime, aztreo-
nam, ertapenem, imipenem, amikacin,
gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin,
levofloxacin, tigecycline, nitrofurantoin,
cosulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), cefopera-
zone and ceftazidime. Antibiotics used
in drug susceptibility tests of the Gram-
positive bacterium S. aureus included
penicillin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, rifam-
picin, clindamycin, TMP/SMZ, tigecycline,
teicoplanin, vancomycin and linezolid.
Tests were performed using the disk-
diffusion method on Mueller­Hinton agar
medium, with plates incubated for 16­20 h
at 35C in room air. The re-identification of
all bacterial isolates and minimal inhibitory
concentration (MIC) determination were
performed at the Department of
Microbiology, Chinese PLA General
Hospital, Beijing, China. MIC values were
defined as sensitive (S), intermediate (I) or
resistant (R), based on cut-off values defined
by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute.19 P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 and
Escherichia coli ATCC25922 were used as
control strains.
Antibiotic resistant gene amplification
The four most frequently isolated Gram-
negative species were selected for polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR) detection of anti-
biotic resistance genes. Genomic DNA was
extracted from each individual isolate
($5 Â 106 cells per isolate) using a Blood
and Cell Culture DNA Maxi kit (QIAGEN,
Venlo, Netherlands) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions, then stored at À20C
until use. The PCR reaction mix comprised
10 ml 2 Â GoldStar Best MasterMix
(CWBIO company, Beijing, China), 2 ml
each primer (Table 2), 2 ml DNA template,
and 6 ml double-distilled water. The cycling
programme involved preliminary denatur-
ation at 94C for 10 min followed by 35
cycles of denaturation at 95C for 30 s,
annealing (temperatures given in Table 2)
for 30 s, and elongation at 72C for 60 s,
followed by a final elongation step at 72C
for 5 min. PCR was performed at the

completed lung function tests; all other
patients were unable to comply or their
illness was too severe. Demographic and
clinical data from the study population are
shown in Table 3.
Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from
the sputum of 109/318 patients (34.28%),
with a total of 124 isolates of 22 pathogenic
bacterial species identified (Table 4). Of
these 124 isolates, 96 (77.42%) were Gram-
negative, with the four most frequently
isolated being K. pneumoniae (21/124;
16.94%), P. aeruginosa (21/124; 16.94%),
A. baumannii (14/124; 11.29%), and E.coli
(8/124; 6.45%). These four bacteria were
selected for PCR analysis of antibiotic
resistance genes.
Data regarding the presence of antibiotic
resistance genes in K. pneumoniae, P. aeru-
ginosa, A. baumannii and E. coli are shown
in Table 5. The absence of the encoding gene
of outer membrane protein D (oprD) and
presence of aac6'-lb-cr was detected in all
four bacteria. Full details of all other anti-
biotic resistance genes are shown in Table 5.
Data regarding antibiotic susceptibility
are shown in Table 6. K. pneumoniae had
>50% susceptibility to all antibiotics tested,
with the exception of ampicillin and nitro-
furantoin. P. aeruginosa was sensitive to
cefoperazone (61.9%) and amikacin
(57.1%), with lower sensitivity to other
antibiotics. A. baumannii was most sensitive
to tigecycline (64.2%). Tigecycline and ami-
kacin were the most effective antibiotics

against E. coli (both 87.5%), followed by
imipenem and cefepime (both 75.0%). All S.
aureus isolates were sensitive to tigecycline,
teicoplanin, vancomycin and linezolid, but
resistant to penicillin and levofloxacin (data
not shown).
Discussion
Pathogenic bacteria were found in 34.3% of
patients with AECOPD in the present study,
based on sputum culture. Others have
reported infection rates of 37.4% in
China,20 32.3% in Hong Kong,21 54.7% in
Italy,22 and 51.7% in the UK (London).7
The primary pathogenic bacteria detected in
the present study were K. pneumoniae
(16.94%), P. aeruginosa (16.94%), A. bau-
mannii (11.29%) and S. pneumoniae
(8.87%), indicating that Gram-negative bac-
teria may be the predominant cause of
AECOPD in Beijing. These findings are
consistent with those from Indonesia,
Malaysia and Taiwan,11,23 but substantially
different from Hong Kong, South Korea
and the Philippines,23 and Western coun-
tries,10 where the microbiology of commu-
nity-acquired pneumonia (H. influenzae,
S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis) was
responsible for AECOPD.
Regional variation in bacterial flora
has several possible explanations.

First, differences in living habits, dietary
habits and antibiotic use may affect the
distribution of pathogenic bacteria.
Although it is unclear whether antibiotic
selection pressure is a factor in the preva-
lence of pathogenic bacteria, care should be
taken in the choice of antibiotic therapy for
people with AECOPD. Secondly, the sever-
ity of AECOPD varied between studies.
Severe AECOPD is associated with a low-
ered immune response as well as hospital-
ization, both of which benefit bacterial
colonization. COPD severity is an important
determinant of micro-organism type,24 and
enteric Gram-negative bacilli and P. aerugi-
nosa may be more frequently isolated from
patients with more severe expiratory airflow
limitation.25 The distribution of pathogenic
bacteria in patients with a single AECOPD
episode has been shown to be different from
that in patients with two or more episodes,
such that H. influenzae was associated with a
single episode and Enterobacteriaceae spe-
cies were only isolated from patients with
several exacerbations.26 Finally, sputum
culture and strain identification methods
varied between studies, and included quan-
titative, semiquantitative and qualitative
culture, biochemical studies, PCR and auto-
matic microbial identification systems. It has
been shown that the use of PCR to detect
Chlamydia pneumoniae in sputum samples
could overestimate its frequency.26
The four primary Gram-negative bacteria
species detected in this study are opportun-
istic pathogens, which always result in a long
term disease course in AECOPD.22 These
bacteria were shown to have vastly different
antibiotic resistance profiles. K. pneumoniae
was >50% susceptible to all antibiotics used

in this study (except ampicillin and nitro-
furantoin), a finding that is similar to
others.20,23 In contrast, P. aeruginosa was
only >50% susceptible to cefoperazone and
amikacin. Notably, the susceptibility of
P. aeruginosa to imipenem was 23.8%,
which is significantly lower than reported
values of 74.8% in 2003 and 70.5% in 2008,
in China.27 A. baumannii is a major patho-
gen in nosocomial infections, and its anti-
biotic resistance is an increasing problem.
Imipenem has been shown to be the most
powerful antimicrobial agent against
A. baumannii,27 but half of A. baumannii
strains were resistant to imipenem in the
present study, and tigecycline was most
effective. We found that the most effective
antibiotics against E. coli were amikacin,
tigecycline and cefoperazone, followed by
cefepime and imipenem, but others have
reported 100% sensitivity to imipenem, fol-
lowed by amikacin and ceftazidime.20 It is
clear that pathogenic bacteria have different
antibiotic sensitivity profiles in different
countries or regions, possibly as a result of
different drug-resistance mechanisms.

There are several antibiotic resistance
mechanisms in Gram-negative bacterium,
including the presence of extended spectrum
b-lactamases and antibiotic modifying
enzymes, and the loss of porins.28 Based on
these mechanisms, we evaluated the pres-
ence 14 antibiotic resistant genes in four
Gram-negative bacteria strains, in order to
examine the relationship between drug
resistance genes and antibiotic susceptibil-
ity. b-lactamase inhibitor resistant genes
blaTEM1, blaSHV, blaDHA-1 and
blaCTX-M-15 were detected in most
A. baumannii and E. coli isolates, which
were resistant to first- and second-genera-
tion cephalosporins and sensitive to some
third- and fourth-generation cephalo-
sporins. It is possible that blaTEM1,
blaSHV, blaDHA-1 and blaCTX-M-15
might be responsible for this resistance to
first- and second-generation cephalosporins.
Conversely, although some P. aeruginosa
isolates were positive for blaTEM1,
blaSHV, blaDHA-1 and blaCTX-M-15,
they were also resistant to first- and
second-generation cephalosporins, suggest-
ing the possible existence of alternative
resistance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa.
The outer membrane protein oprD regulates
the entry of carbapenems,29 and the absence
of oprD was the most prevalent mechanism
of resistance in P. aeruginosa in the present
study. Although OprD was absent from the
largely imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa
isolates in the current study, it was also not
present in imipenem-sensitive K. pneumo-
niae, A. baumannii and E. coli isolates.
Similar results were found with oxa-10 and
oxa-2, which were detected in most imipe-
nem-sensitive K. pneumoniae isolates, but
not in imipenem-sensitive A. baumannii and
E. coli isolates. This finding suggests that
oxa-10 and oxa-2 are not responsible for
imipenem resistance in K. pneumoniae.
Plasmid-mediated qnr genes can facilitate
bacterial spread and are mainly present in
K. pneumoniae and E. coli.30 In the present
study, 52.4% of K. pneumoniae isolates and
75.0% of E. coli isolates were positive for
qnrB. Interestingly, the aminoglycosides
resistance genes, aac6'-lb-cr and aac(3)-II,
were detected in all four Gram-negative
bacteria in the present study, but all isolates
were highly susceptibility to amikacin. It is
possible that the amikacin resistance mech-
anism in Beijing is not related to aac6'-lb-cr
and aac(3)-II.
The present study had two main limita-
tions. First, the majority of patients (229/
318) did not complete lung-function tests
during the study period. It was therefore not
possible to evaluate the relationship between
the severity of airway obstruction and the
distribution of pathogenic bacteria.
Secondly, sensitive techniques such as PCR
were not used for the identification of bac-
teria in sputum samples, some of which (e.g.
M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and
Legionella) require special culture media
and methods, and are therefore difficult to
identify. To our knowledge, this is the first
multicentre study of bacteriology in patients
with AECOPD performed in Beijing. The
strengths of our study were its prospective
nature, with a relatively large sample size,
and the inclusion of tests for antibiotic
susceptibility and drug-resistance genes.
In conclusion, we found that K. pneumo-
niae and P. aeruginosa are the most common
pathogenic bacteria in AECOPD in Beijing.
Amikacin and cefoperazone provide suffi-
cient antibacterial activity against the four
main Gram-negative bacilli isolated from
these patients (K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa,
A. baumannii and E. coli), but the multidrug
resistance of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii
warrants attention. These findings may be
helpful in selecting antibiotic therapy for
AECOPD in Beijing.
