Article
The demands of contemporary nursing practice necessitate
clinical reasoning and decision making at a level never
before experienced within the profession (del Bueno, 2005;
Shinnick, Woo, & Mentes, 2011). Nurses are viewed as
independent practitioners with increased autonomy while
caring for increasingly complex and acutely ill patients.
Furthermore, current mandates regarding quality improve-
ment and patient safety domains demand that even entry-
level nurses must be proficient in accurate assessment and
implementation of timely, evidenced-based, and patient-
centered interventions.
Nursing practice includes multifaceted reasoning and
complex decision making with minimal standardized guid-
ance in how to evaluate this process among nursing stu-
dents. A common thread within nursing programs includes
patient-care planning utilizing the nursing process.
Therefore, providing students with scripted simulation sce-
narios integrating multiple diagnoses and varying patient
presentations facilitates the development of clinical reason-
ing via utilization of the nursing process. This learning
activity involved pre- and post-simulation nursing process
activities evaluating students' ability to organize pertinent
patient data and implement appropriate clinical care while
utilizing simulation as an integral method of instruction.
Students' pre- and post-simulation nursing process records
were reviewed for accurate assessment, appropriate care
planning, and implementation of interventions.
Background
Clinical reasoning is an essential component to "thinking
like a nurse," as is critical, creative, scientific, and formal
criterial reasoning (Benner, Sutphen, Leonard, & Day, 2010).
Appropriate clinical reasoning skills are essential to compe-
tence in nursing. Current practice requires that even new
graduates must be prepared to make difficult decisions for
patients with multisystem dysfunction (Banning, 2008;
Lasater, 2007; Levett-Jones et al., 2010). The term clinical
reasoning is often used interchangeably with critical think-
ing and clinical judgment in the literature. Clinical reasoning
is defined as "the cognitive processes and strategies that
nurses use to understand the significance of patient data, to
identify and diagnose actual or potential patient problems, to
make clinical decisions to assist in problem resolution, and
to achieve positive patient outcomes" (Fonteyn & Ritter,
2008, p. 236). Even when provided with the same informa-
tion and the same set of circumstances, researchers have
reported that clinical reasoning among experienced nurses
varies (Sedgwick, Grigg, & Dersch, 2014).

Utilization of the Nursing Process to
Foster Clinical Reasoning During a
Simulation Experience
Amanda Lambie1, Kelly Schwend1, and Andrea Scholl1
Abstract
Nursing practice includes complex reasoning and multifaceted decision making with minimal standardized guidance in how
to evaluate this phenomenon among nursing students. Learning outcomes related to the clinical reasoning process among
novice baccalaureate nursing students during a simulation experience were evaluated. Nursing process records were utilized
to evaluate and foster the development of clinical reasoning in a high-fidelity medical-surgical simulation experience. Students
were unable to describe and process pertinent patient information appropriately prior to the simulation experience.
Students' ability to identify pertinent patient cues and plan appropriate patient care improved following the simulation. The
learning activity afforded a structured opportunity to identify cues, prioritize the proper course of nursing interventions, and
engage in collaboration among peers. The simulation experience provides faculty insight into the students' clinical reasoning
processes, while providing students with a clear framework for successfully accomplishing learning outcomes.

Therefore, nursing students require education for recog-
nizing relevant patient cues and understanding how to make
connections between accurate assessment and patient out-
comes via utilization of the nursing process (Benner, 2001).
A nurse's approach to critical thinking and reasoning is
believed to affect the accuracy of the nursing diagnosis.
Thus, it is directly linked to influencing patient care and
outcomes (Paans, Sermeus, Nieweg, Krijnen, & van der
Schans, 2012). The development of critical thinking skills
is multifaceted and encompasses several parameters of
metacognitive self-awareness. These include the ability to
adapt to complex and varied situations, application of the-
ory to practice, self-motivation and enterprising behaviors,
working effectively with other members of the patient-care
team to accomplish group tasks, strategic thinking, and
appropriate assessment of one's strengths and weaknesses
(Conley, 2012).
The interplay between critical thinking and clinical rea-
soning informs a student's clinical judgment. Faculty facili-
tation of the development of student's critical thinking skills
is guided by American Nurses Association (ANA) practice
standards, The Joint Commission Standards, Quality and
Safety Education for Nurses competencies, and Institute of
Medicine competencies. According to Alfaro-LeFevre
(2013), components of reasoning within the clinical setting
include the following:
·
· Diagnostic reasoning (applying nursing process to
determine, prevent, and manage patient problems)
·
· Problem solving, decision making, and judgment
·
· Patient, caregiver, and community safety and welfare
·
· Patient- and family-centered care
·
· Moral and ethical reasoning
·
· Applying evidence-based practice
·
· Teamwork and collaboration
·
· Clinical teaching and learning
·
· Using and creating electronic medical date (informatics)
·
· Self-improvement, stress management
·
· Quality improvement (improving outcomes and care
delivery systems).
Simulation experiences provide a setting in which nursing
students verbally practice the appropriate nursing care of
patients and families in specific clinical situations. Educators
who utilize simulation are able to highlight the students'
points of growth and meaning within a patient scenario,
while shielding the student in the safety of a virtual clinical
environment. Simulations allow nursing students to function
in the role of a nurse via the application of evidence-based
knowledge, implementation of clinical reasoning and judg-
ment, and the development of skilled knowhow (Benner
et al., 2010). Objective evidence of the student's ability to
transfer theoretical knowledge and incorporate into clinical
practice is crucial. This transference of skill-based knowl-
edge can be evaluated via nursing process records, which
utilize the development of nursing diagnoses and formula-
tion of a plan of care.
Simulation Experience
To expand the body of literature linking simulation experi-
ences of first-year student nurses to the development of criti-
cal thinking knowledge and clinical reasoning through
application of appropriate utilization of the nursing process,
a simulation learning activity was implemented. This article
describes and discusses the benefits of utilizing simulation
for fostering clinical reasoning. The evaluation of the learn-
ing activity included a comparison of pre- and post-simula-
tion clinical reasoning assignments (nursing process records/
nursing care plans) of sophomore undergraduate baccalaure-
ate nursing students. Nursing faculty facilitating the simula-
tion experience evaluated assignments.
Patient-care planning required students to gather all
known subjective and objective patient information, high-
light the abnormal findings, and analyze the data. Then,
through critical reasoning, the student group arrived at a con-
sensus on the patient's priority problem and formulated what
they postulated as the appropriate nursing diagnosis. The stu-
dents could then discuss and record the patient's treatment
goals and the nursing interventions required to evaluate their
own performance and ensure that the patient's treatment
goals were met. The nursing process record assignment
required students to document the rationale for choosing
nursing interventions and allowed the faculty a window into
the students' clinical reasoning and decision-making
processes.
Thirty-six second-semester sophomore baccalaureate
nursing students participated in the simulation as a required
activity toward completion of their medical-surgical practi-
cum rotation. The simulation experience utilized for this
learning activity was designed to facilitate the transition of
nursing theory to clinical practice. Each simulation experi-
ence, including preparation, interactive simulation, and
debriefing, occurred in the department of nursing simulation
lab. The duration of experience was approximately 4 hr.
The nursing program implements simulation as a compo-
nent of the students'required practicum hours. Pre- and post-
nursing process record assignments were completed as the
written assignment component of the simulation experience
and were collected for review. Simulation was a non-graded
assignment. Performance in the simulation experience had
no effect on the students' final clinical course grade.
Pre-Briefing
Students were provided with learning objectives for the
experience and a post-operative patient case study, which
included a history and physical to review in preparation of
the simulation experience (see Appendix A). They were also
instructed to review theoretical content in the course text
Lambie et al. 3
related to post-operative nursing care. Prior to entering the
simulated patient's room, students received a brief overview
of the simulation day. Students were provided with a nursing
process record and were asked to utilize the nursing process
and the case study to complete the nursing process record
(see Appendix B). Students completed the nursing process
record as a group of four. These de-identified nursing process
records were collected and marked "pre." Students were then
brought to the simulated patient's room where they partici-
pated in the planned simulation scenario.
Debriefing
Debriefing immediately followed the completion of the sim-
ulation scenario. Students were directed to an adjoining
classroom where they were asked to complete a new nursing
process record marked "post." Students were not allowed to
access any reference materials for the assignment. They were
instructed to collaborate and complete the care plan based
upon their collective simulation experiences. The faculty
then collected the "post" nursing process record, and simula-
tion debriefing occurred.
Results
Nursing process records were utilized to assess the evolution of
clinical reasoning prior to and following exposure to a high-
fidelity post-operative simulation experience. The nursing pro-
cess record reflects the components of the clinical reasoning
model (Hoffman, 2007), which details the thinking strategies
of both novice and experienced nurses during realistic patient-
care scenarios, and has been utilized in studies measuring the
development of clinical reasoning (Levett-Jones et al., 2010).
In addition, debriefing of participants occurred, and open-
ended questions related to student actions during the simula-
tion were presented. The student responses on their
post-simulation care plan assignment guided the debriefing
session. Written forms of debriefing and reflection, such as
care plan assignments, allowed nursing students to process
their simulation experience and provided the instructor
insight into the students' cognitive learning (Park et al.,
2013). Jeffries (2012) discusses how guided reflection, when
incorporated into simulation, promotes the self-awareness
required for the development of clinical judgment, thus fos-
tering quality patient care. Furthermore, post-simulation
debriefing and reflection, where select patient responses that
occurred during the simulation are reviewed, allow for dis-
cussion of the natural progression of nursing actions and
their potential adverse effects.
As a way to evaluate the nursing process records, faculty
utilized an evaluative table consisting of elements of the care
planning process as described by Carpenito-Moyet (2010).
In addition, clinical reasoning was identified subjectively
using the clinical reasoning model (Levett-Jones et al.,
2010). Variability in interpretation of the students' nursing
process records was eliminated as only one faculty member
evaluated the assignments. Correlation of the components of
the clinical reasoning model and the students' nursing care
plans are outlined in Table 1.
When evaluating the assignments, there were notable dif-
ferences between the pre- and post-simulation nursing pro-
cess records. Pre-simulation nursing process records reflected
a lack of relevant patient cues. Relevant patient cues are nec-
essary to anticipate potential outcomes and negative sequelae.
Faculty observed that the highest patient priority was identi-
fied incorrectly among patient cues, leading to the develop-
ment of an inappropriate course of nursing action. Nearly
half of the students demonstrated correct correlation of
selected patient outcome criteria or goals relevant to the
patient's actual nursing needs. Approximately one third of
students correctly processed assessment information and
identified pertinent patient cues and relevant clinical identi-
fiers. Identification of relevant patient cues would have led
to a more optimal course of nursing actions.
Post-simulation nursing process records revealed signifi-
cant improvement with selection of patient outcome criteria
or goals and their correlation and relevance to the patient's
actual health needs. All students were able to achieve this
objective upon completion of the simulation. Following the
simulation experience, students' ability to process assess-
ment information and identify pertinent patient cues and rel-
evant clinical identifiers increased. The post-simulation
nursing process records demonstrate that simulation was an
integral component to the refinement of the students' ability
to translate theory to practice through clinical reasoning. The
simulation experience has the potential to provide students
with a clear framework for successfully accomplishing learn-
ing outcomes related to the nursing process.
Discussion
Students' exposure to simulation is vital to foster clinical rea-
soning and facilitate the development of critical thinking skills
in nursing. The pre-simulation nursing process records identi-
fied a relevant learning need in nursing education. Through
the participation in a simulation experience, students engaged
in active learning and could immediately verbalize under-
standing of knowledge deficits related to identifying relevant
patient cues and the ability to anticipate various potential out-
comes for the patient. Nursing students had the opportunity to
immediately remediate through post-simulation nursing pro-
cess records. Faculty provided guidance and constructive
feedback in a safe and controlled learning environment. The
simulation experience provides the opportunity to develop and
refine students' utilization of the nursing process.
Limitations
Limitations include that the simulation was implemented by
the same faculty member, in the same simulation scenario,
4 SAGE Open
and at the same university with a small sample, over the
course of one semester. In addition, the sample consisted of
primarily Caucasian female nursing students. Therefore,
generalizability of the findings may be limited. The evalua-
tion of the nursing process records was potentially strength-
ened because only one faculty member reviewed them.
However, the evaluation was subjective in nature, therefore
bias may have existed.
Implications
It is incumbent upon nursing faculty to foster students'clinical
reasoning skills. The American Association of Colleges of
Nursing (AACN) has outlined recommendations for schools
of nursing detailing the educational requirements necessary to
provide quality patient care (Barton, Armstrong, Prehelm,
Gelmon, & Andrus, 2009). Therefore, clinical reasoning must
be embedded throughout the nursing curriculum. The simula-
tion experience provides an opportunity to utilize the nursing
process and strengthen the link between theory and clinical
practice. Faculty must be able to integrate domains of profes-
sional practice, such as communication and collaboration,
patient-centered care, and best practices. Recommendations
for faculty include development and analysis of instrumenta-
tion to evaluate the attributes of nursing students'nursing pro-
cess records and clinical reasoning ability. Schools of nursing
should incorporate simulation at every level of nursing
education as a means of facilitating clinical reasoning abilities,
thereby potentially improving nursing students'ability to posi-
tively affect patient care. Replication of this simulation experi-
ence utilizing various scenarios is warranted to further the
research base in nursing education and clinical reasoning.
