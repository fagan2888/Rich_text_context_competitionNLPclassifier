Acculturation and Healthy Lifestyle
Among Latinos With Diabetes
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Latinos have a high prevalence of diabetes and disproportionately
experience diabetic complications. We sought to examine the association of
acculturation on healthy lifestyle habits among the Latino population in the
United States with diabetes.
METHODS We studied Latino adults (aged 20 years) with previously diagnosed
diabetes in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(unweighted N=467; weighted N=1,957,778). Healthy lifestyle habits were those
consistent with recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)
regarding exercise, smoking, obesity, and diet. Acculturation was measured with
the Short Acculturation Scale, a validated 5-item scale assessing use of the Spanish
language. Logistic regression analyses of acculturation and healthy behaviors were
computed controlling for access to care, demographics, and disease characteristics.
RESULTS In bivariate analyses, compared with their less-acculturated counterparts,
individuals who were more-acculturated to any extent were less likely to have a
higher fiber intake (9.4% vs 35.4%, P=.001) and lower saturated fat intake (17.2%
vs 46.5%, P=.03). More-acculturated individuals were more likely to report leisure
time exercise (59.2% vs 19.3%, P<.001), whereas the proportion of individuals
who smoked did not differ. In logistic regression analyses using the 1994 ADA
dietary guidelines, more-acculturated individuals were less likely than their less-
acculturated counterparts to meet dietary criteria for saturated fat consumption
(odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.41). When using the stricter
2006 ADA dietary guidelines, more-acculturated individuals were less likely to have
recommended consumption of both saturated fat (odds ratio, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02-
0.20) and fiber (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08-0.48). Acculturation did not signifi-
cantly influence exercise and smoking status in logistic regression analyses.
CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that acculturation among diabetic Latinos
to the general US culture is associated with adoption of some less desirable
dietary habits.

INTRODUCTION
Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the United States.1
The deleterious outcomes of this disease can be decreased
through appropriate ongoing management and treatment.2 Dia-
betes burden is not distributed equally throughout the population. In par-
ticular, Latinos have a higher prevalence of diabetes, more complications,
and worse outcomes than non-Latino whites.3-7 Quality of care for dia-
betes among Latinos continues to lag behind that for non-Latino whites.8
Moreover, recent projections continue to predict an increasing prevalence
of diabetes, particularly for Latinos.9
The US Census indicates that 14.5% of adult US residents are for-
eign-born.10 These immigrants, particularly minorities, may require inter-
ventions and modifications to the standard health care delivery system
that differ from those of their ethnic counterparts who are born in the

United States. Differences in diabetes prevalence
and care among ethnic subgroups are associated with
degree of acculturation.11,12 For example, Latinos who
are less acculturated to the majority US culture tend
to have a higher prevalence of diabetes and more
complications.11,13
One aspect of successful diabetes management
takes place outside of the physician's office and entails
the patient adopting a healthy lifestyle. For patients
with diabetes, a healthy lifestyle includes an appro-
priate diet and exercise.14,15 These self-management
behaviors related to lifestyle may be particularly influ-
enced by culturally specific attitudes and beliefs.16-18 In
particular, some data suggest that acculturation for the
general population of Latinos has been associated with
suboptimal lifestyle choices, including a low intake of
fruits and vegetables, a higher consumption of fats, and
smoking.19 Acculturation among Latinos with diabetes
to the mainstream US culture may thus influence the
healthiness of their lifestyle, particularly depending on
whether the mainstream society has a healthy lifestyle.
The purpose of this study was to examine the associa-
tion of acculturation with a healthy lifestyle among
Latinos with diabetes in the United States.
METHODS
Design
We analyzed data from the 1999-2004 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Partici-
pants in this survey constitute a nationally representative
sample of the noninstitutionalized US population. The
NHANES design includes an oversampling of minorities
and enables determination of population estimates. The
NHANES program is relatively unusual compared with
other nationally representative surveys in that it com-
bines interviews with physical examinations and labora-
tory studies. More information on the methodology of
the NHANES 1999-2004, including laboratory assess-
ments, can be found at the National Center for Health
Statistics Web site.20 NHANES data are not obtained
using a simple random sample; rather, a complex, mul-
tistage, probability sampling design is used to select
participants representative of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized US population. Certain population subgroups
are oversampled to increase the reliability and precision
of estimates of health status indicators for these groups.
The data are weighted to obtain population estimates of
noninstitutionalized individuals in the United States.
Sample
The individuals analyzed in our study were Latino
adults (aged 20 years) with previously diagnosed
diabetes. The NHANES contains a series of questions
asked to ascertain an individual's race and ethnicity.
Race and Hispanic ethnicity were addressed in separate
questions. Latinos were the only group asked questions
on language, allowing for assessments of acculturation.
Interviews were conducted in both English and Span-
ish by trained bilingual interviewers. Respondents were
free to switch between languages during the interview
depending on which language they were most com-
fortable with in answering each question. Individuals
were considered to have previously diagnosed diabetes
if they answered affirmatively to a question of "Has a
doctor ever told you that you have diabetes?" Analyses
were based on 467 individuals, who represented a US
population of 1,957,778.
Measures
Acculturation Status
Acculturation is an indication of the cultural change of
minority individuals to the majority culture. Accultura-
tion measures vary widely depending on the construct
used. We used 2 general constructs available in the
NHANES 1999-2004 to assess acculturation: language
and country of birth. Both of these have been used
previously as proxies for acculturation.21-23
The degree of acculturation based on language was
assessed using the Short Acculturation Scale (SAS), a
5-item scale measuring use of the Spanish language that
has good internal reliability (Cronbach  0.90) and
has been shown to be comparable to longer published
acculturation scales. This scale has been validated in
several Hispanic populations, with correlations seen
between measured acculturation and number of genera-
tions living in the United States, length of time lived
in the United States, age at the time of arrival in the
United States, and self-reported acculturation.24 The
scale consists of the following 5 questions: (1) In general,
what language do you read and speak? (2) What was the
language(s) you used as a child? (3) What language(s) do
you usually speak at home? (4) In which language(s) do
you usually think? and (5) What language(s) do you usu-
ally speak with your friends? The options for answering
each question are "only Spanish," "more Spanish than
English," "both equally," "more English than Spanish,"
and "only English." These responses were each scored
on a scale from 0 to 4, yielding a total score ranging
from 0 to 20, with higher scores signifying greater
acculturation. The acculturation score was used to
define 5 categories representing a continuum of accul-
turation from Spanish language only (a score of 0),
primarily Spanish (1-5), about equal use of Spanish and
English (6-10), primarily English (11-15), and nearly all
English (16-20). Because of the small size of the group
with previously diagnosed diabetes, we classified their
acculturation simply as any (1-20) vs none (0).

Healthy Lifestyle
Measures of healthy lifestyle included smoking, obe-
sity, exercise, and diet. Current smoking status was
ascertained. Individuals with a body mass index (BMI)
of 30 kg/m2 or greater were considered obese, and
those with a BMI from 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 were con-
sidered overweight. Individuals were asked whether
they participated in vigorous or moderate levels of
leisure time physical activity; those who reported nei-
ther vigorous nor moderate physical activities were
categorized as getting no exercise, whereas those who
reported either or both were categorized as getting
exercise. Respondents' diets were evaluated accord-
ing to whether they met the 1994 ADA guidelines for
individuals with diabetes in terms of daily fiber intake
(20 g), cholesterol intake (300 mg), and saturated fat
intake (<10% of total calories).25 In addition, their diets
were also assessed according to the 2006 ADA guide-
lines for fiber intake (14 g per 1,000 total calories),
cholesterol intake (<200 mg), and saturated fat intake
(<7% of total calories) because these guidelines are
more restrictive and are recommended based on cur-
rent knowledge.26
Demographic Characteristics and Access to Care
We included the following demographic characteristics
of respondents: sex, age (20-64 vs 65 years), poverty-
income ratio (<1.0 vs 1.0), and education (high school
graduate vs not). Access to care was assessed from
whether the respondent had health insurance and a
routine place for health care.
Analysis
Because the NHANES has a complex sampling design
that makes the resulting sample representative of the
noninstitutionalized US population, we were able to
make nationally representative estimates. We used
SUDAAN software (RTI International, Research Tri-
angle Park, North Carolina) to account for the weight-
ing and complex sampling design. We performed 2
tests for bivariate relationships between acculturation,
as measured both by the SAS score and by country of
birth, and lifestyle measures.
We conducted multivariate analyses to investi-
gate the relative odds that individuals with any level
of acculturation (SAS score >0) practiced healthy
habits, such as not smoking, getting exercise, and eat-
ing a healthy diet. Logistic regression analyses were
computed and controlled for the potential confound-
ing variables of age, sex, poverty, education, health
insurance, having a routine place for care, number of
years with diabetes, and having been told by a physi-
cian that one has retinopathy, hypertension, or high
cholesterol. The ADA recommendations have recently
changed regarding some dietary aspects of a healthy
lifestyle, so we examined the relationship between
acculturation and diet with both the recommenda-
tions in place at the time of data collection (1994 ADA
guidelines) and the current recommendations (2006
ADA guidelines). Because socioeconomic status could
potentially modify the relationship between accultura-
tion and lifestyle, we investigated interaction effects
between health insurance, poverty, and education and
the SAS score in the models.
RESULTS
Depending on the measure used to assess acculturation,
an estimated 36% to 69% of Latino individuals with
diabetes nationally were more-acculturated (Table 1).
Latinos with diabetes who were less-accultur-
ated according to SAS score were predominantly
female, and they were significantly more likely that
their more-acculturated counterparts to have annual
incomes of less than $20,000 and less likely to be
high school graduates (Table 1). Less-acculturated
individuals were also less likely to have private health
insurance or a usual place for health care. There were
no significant differences between the groups in terms
of current smoking or BMI, but less-acculturated indi-
viduals exercised much less during leisure time. When
using the 1994 ADA dietary guidelines, in bivariate
analyses, dietary fiber and cholesterol intakes were not
significantly different between the groups, but less-
acculturated individuals were significantly more likely
to get fewer than 10% of their daily calories from
saturated fats. When using the 2006 ADA dietary
guidelines, there still was no difference between
the more-acculturated and less-acculturated groups
with regard to dietary cholesterol intake; however,
less-acculturated individuals were significantly more
likely to have diets high in fiber and low in saturated
fat. This effect was also apparent for acculturation as
assessed by country of birth.
The relationships between the lifestyle character-
istics and socioeconomic measures are shown in Table
2. The only significant differences were that compared
with individuals who had graduated from high school,
those who had not were less likely to exercise in their
leisure time and more likely to have diets low in cho-
lesterol and saturated fat.
The results of the logistic regression analyses
indicated that when the SAS score was used as the
indicator of acculturation, more-acculturated individu-
als were no more or less likely than less-acculturated
individuals to be nonsmokers (odds ratio, 0.5; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.17-1.72) or to engage in
some leisure time exercise (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI,

0.85-5.53). When using the 1994 ADA dietary guide-
lines, more-acculturated individuals were significantly
less likely to have diets low in saturated fats (Table 3).
When using the 2006 ADA dietary guidelines, how-
ever, they were significantly less likely to have diets
both high in fiber and low in saturated fat.
When country of birth was used as the indicator
of acculturation, the associations between accultura-
tion and healthy lifestyle were not as strong (Table 4).
According to the 2006 criteria, acculturation was only
associated with saturated fat intake, and that association
indicated that individuals born outside the United States
were more likely to have a diet low in saturated fat.
We found no evidence of an interaction between any
of the socioeconomic indicators (health insurance, pov-
erty, and education) and the SAS score in the models.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study suggest that although accul-
turation of Latinos to the mainstream US culture may
be somewhat beneficial in terms of access to care
and socioeconomic status, less-acculturated Latinos
with diabetes tend to have healthier diets than their
more-acculturated counterparts. Specifically, more-
acculturated Latinos with diabetes were less likely to

have diets higher in fiber and lower in saturated fat;
moreover, this effect was more apparent when using
the stricter ADA dietary criteria put forth in 2006.
These differences suggest that adopting an "Ameri-
can" diet may not be a desirable change in behavior.
This finding is especially pertinent in light of previous
studies demonstrating that Latinos have difficulty in
maintaining healthy traditional habits while adapting
to the mainstream culture, which may be due to a lack
of perceived behavioral control, as they
are unable to develop strategies to protect
these beneficial traditional habits.27-29
Acculturation has been linked to the
likelihood of developing diabetes, as well
as to quality of care, with more-accultur-
ated individuals receiving better care.8,13
Little research has focused on the impact
of acculturation on diet among Latinos
with diabetes, however. Delivery of cultur-
ally competent health care by professionals
has been discussed at length, but evidence
suggests that self-management of diabetes
in modern US society may be difficult for
Latino patients as they struggle to decide
which traditional behaviors to retain and
which new ones to adopt.28
Our findings suggest that an under-
standing of the complexities in providing culturally
competent care must include an understanding not
just of where the patient is coming from culturally,
but where they are now. Having a medical home
with continuity of care may help to ensure that
the patient-physician relationship is intact and that
the physician can understand factors that may be
changing in the patient's ability to adhere to treat-
ment or lifestyle recommendations. Consequently,

an initial lack of health insurance or disruption of
health insurance coverage is a big problem in socially
disadvantaged populations because of its impact on
this continuity and having a medical home, and cor-
responding delivery of quality care.30
There are several limitations to this study. First, the
data set is cross-sectional, which limits the ability to
make inferences about causality. The NHANES data
do, however, allow us to generate population estimates
for Latinos with diabetes in the US population. Second,
we used both a general measure of acculturation (being
born in the United States) and a standard scale that
represents acculturation based on language (SAS score),
and the latter was significantly associated with several
indicators of healthy lifestyle. It is possible, however,
that because acculturation includes multiple factors
regarding behaviors and beliefs, our measure was too
crude and simplistic to appropriately capture nuances
of culture. Third, the question regarding physician-
diagnosed diabetes, which was the basis for including
individuals in the study, does not discriminate between
individuals told that they had type 1 diabetes and indi-
viduals told that they had type 2 diabetes; however, the
lifestyle questions we used are applicable to individu-
als with either type of diabetes. Fourth, although the
NHANES allowed us to look at the current behaviors
and acculturation of Latinos generally, the survey ques-
tions were limited regarding background characteristics
of the subset of Latino immigrants. Consequently, we
were unable to investigate questions such as whether
immigrants from rural areas of Mexico differ in their
behaviors from those hailing from urban areas. Fifth,
in the bivariate analyses, more-acculturated individuals
were more likely to engage in leisure time exercise than
their less-acculturated counterparts. This finding does
not necessarily mean that less-acculturated individuals
do not engage in exercise, but rather that
they may not use their leisure time for
exercise. Individuals working in more
physical and manual labor occupations
may seek out less vigorous leisure time
pursuits. For many, the importance of exer-
cising after work may take a lower priority
than resting from a workday considerably
longer than 8 hours that involves physi-
cal activity. Even though we could not
measure exercise obtained during leisure
time vs on the job, once we controlled for
demographic characteristics, the relation-
ship between acculturation and leisure
time exercise was no longer significant.
In conclusion, the common assump-
tion that ethnic minority populations
will always benefit from acculturation to
mainstream US society does not appear to hold true
in the case of healthy lifestyle behaviors among Lati-
nos with diabetes. This study adds to other evidence
that aspects of acculturation may be maladaptive.19
Dietary habits of Latinos with diabetes who are less-
acculturated to US society are healthier than those of
Latinos who are more-acculturated. It is important to
understand the complex process of acculturation as
we focus on developing culturally sensitive health care
programs, in order to encourage patients to maintain
healthy traditional behaviors while simultaneously
adopting beneficial aspects of the mainstream culture.
