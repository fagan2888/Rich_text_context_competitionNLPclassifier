Abstract
Objectives: To examine the occurrence of stressful life events, psychological comorbidity and
suicide risk in patients with psoriasis or other dermatological conditions.
Methods: Consecutive adult outpatients with psoriasis or other dermatological conditions
completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Hamilton scales for depression and anxiety.
Results: The study included 157 patients (91 with psoriasis; 66 with other conditions [melanoma;
allergy]). Patients with psoriasis were significantly more likely to have experienced major life events
in the 12 months before diagnosis, have had a psychiatric diagnosis and to have experienced past
suicidal ideation than patients with other dermatological conditions.
Conclusions: Patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of psychiatric comorbidities, suicidal
ideation, and long-term course of the disease compared with patients who have other
dermatological conditions. Psychiatric assessment is highly recommended in patients with
psoriasis.

Introduction
Psoriasis is a common condition, affecting
up to 3% of the population in industrialized
countries.1,2 Although its aetiology is not
entirely clear, psoriasis appears to be a
multifactorial inflammatory mediated dis-
ease, involving both genetic and environ-
mental causes.3,4 In addition, emotional
stress seems to plays an important role in
the onset and exacerbation of psoriasis.5­7
As with other dermatological conditions,
psoriasis worsens with stress in between
37% and 78% of patients,7,8 and stressful
life events are both a cause and an aggravat-
ing factor for psoriasis.5,7 In over 40% of
cases, the onset of psoriasis occurs in
patients <30 years of age,9 which may
have a serious negative psychosocial
impact for individuals, including feelings of
stigmatization and increased risk of depres-
sion and/or anxiety.10,11 Some studies have
demonstrated that >90% of patients with
psoriasis have a psychiatric diagnosis,
mostly related to depression and anxiety
disorders.12,13
Evidence suggests a relationship between
psoriasis and an increased risk of suicidal-
ity,14­16 with psoriasis having a stronger
association with risk of suicidal ideation
than other dermatological conditions.17 The
aim of the current study was to examine the
occurrence of stressful life events, psycho-
logical comorbidity and suicide risk in
patients with psoriasis.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study enrolled consecutive adult out-
patients with dermatological conditions who
attended the Department of Dermatology,
S. Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of
Rome, Rome, Italy between October 2013
and September 2014. Inclusion criteria were:
at least one dermatological disease; aged
18­65 years; ability to provide informed
consent. Exclusion criteria were: active
substance abuse; dementia; severe, active
medical disorder. Patients completed a
sociodemographic questionnaire and the
Hamilton scales for depression (HAM-D)18
and anxiety (HAM-A).19
All patients provided written informed
consent prior to enrolment, and the ethics
committee of S. Andrea Hospital, Sapienza
University of Rome, Rome, Italy approved
the study.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or
n patients (%). Bivariate analyses were
performed using 2-test, one-way Fisher
exact test, or Student's t-test for independent
samples. After Benjamini and Hochberg
correction for multitesting, statistically sig-
nificant (P < 0.05) variables were selected
for multivariate analyses with log-linear
models. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSSÕ version 19.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ.
Results
The study included 157 patients (67 male
and 90 female; mean age 50.15 Æ 16.21
years; age range 18­86 years). Of these, 91
(58.0%) had psoriasis, 35 had melanoma
(22.3%) and 31 had an allergic dermato-
logical condition (19.7%). For the purposes
of the study, patients with melanoma or
allergy were combined into a single group
(other conditions). Demographic and clin-
ical characteristics of the study population
as a whole and patients stratified into groups
are shown in Table 1. There were no statis-
tically significant differences between groups
in sex distribution, age, education, marital
status or employment status. Patients with
psoriasis were significantly more likely than
those with other conditions to have path-
ology extending over >80% of the body
(P < 0.01) and illness of >8 years' duration
(P < 0.001; Table 1).

Data regarding psychiatric comorbidities
are shown in Table 2. Patients with psoriasis
were significantly more likely than those
with other conditions to have experienced
major life events in the 12 months before
diagnosis (P < 0.05), to have a psychiatric
diagnosis (P < 0.01), and to have experi-
enced suicidal ideation in the past (P < 0.01).
In addition, patients with psoriasis had
significantly more severe current depression
than patients with other conditions
(P < 0.01).
Analysis with a log-linear model (fit
indices: likelihood ratio 2 ¼ 14.99;
DF ¼ 24; P ¼ 0.92) found that those with
psoriasis were significantly more likely than
those with other conditions to have illness
duration >8 years (risk ratio 3.64; 95%
confidence intervals 1.62, 8.18). There was
no association between psoriasis and any
other variable found to be significant in
bivariate analyses.
Discussion
The results of the present study indicate that
patients affected by psoriasis are at an
increased risk of experiencing lifetime suicidal
ideation compared with those with other
dermatological conditions, which is in accord-
ance with the findings of others.14,15,17 As we
found in our patient group, patients may
experience suicidal ideation before entering
the study,15 suggesting that the course of the
illness may be related to a long term psychi-
atric comorbidity. However, in contrast to
others,14 we did not find a significant increase
in current suicidal ideation among patients
with psoriasis.
Patients with psoriasis in the present study
reported more severe depression than those
with other conditions. In contrast to others,15
however, we found no between-group differ-
ence in severity of anxiety. Depression is
considered a common co-occurring condition

in people with psoriasis,20 and is also an
important risk factor for treatment non-
adherence. Our findings confirmed this
increased number of psychiatric diagnoses in
patients with psoriasis, with 38.5% having
had a lifetime psychiatric disorder diagnosis
compared with 16.7% of patients with other
conditions.12,21,22 Psoriasis is often character-
ized by the occurrence of a major life event
before onset. Our study found that 73.6% of
patients with psoriasis reported a negative life
event 12 months before the onset of symp-
toms, which is significantly more than those
with other conditions. This result confirmed
the previously reported relationship between
stressful life events and disease onset, which is
more common in psoriasis than in other
dermatological conditions.7 Our findings
provide further evidence for the connection
between stress and psoriasis, which has been
supported by several studies.3,5,6,22 The long-
term course of illness in patients with psoriasis
reinforces the effect of this condition on
health-related quality-of-life and the risk of
psychiatric disorders and suicidal ideation.
Our study has several limitations, includ-
ing the small sample size and cross-sectional
study design. In addition, psoriasis naturally
has a longer disease course and affects a
larger area of the body than other dermato-
logical diseases such as melanoma, which
characteristically affects a small area and has
a poor 5-year survival rate.24
In conclusion, the present study confirms
that patients with psoriasis have an
increased risk of psychiatric comorbidities,

suicidal ideation and long-term course of the
disease compared with those who have
other dermatological conditions. Given
the increased risk of suicidal ideation and
depressive symptoms, psychiatric and sui-
cide risk assessment is highly recommended,
particularly among those with a previous
psychiatric diagnosis and history of suicidal
ideation. Addressing psychiatric comorbid-
ities is also important to improve patients'
treatment compliance and enhance their
health-related quality-of-life.
