Minding the gap: Elucidating the disconnect between arts participation
metrics and arts engagement within immigrant communities

A growing gap between national metrics of arts participation and the many, evolving ways in
which people participate in artistic and aesthetic activities limits the degree to which such data
can usefully inform policy decisions. The National Endowment for the Arts' Survey of Public
Participation in the Arts (SPPA) is the primary source of arts participation data in the USA, but
this instrument inadequately evaluates how members of minority and immigrant communities
participate in the arts. As the USA nears a historic demographic shift to being a majority­
minority nation ­ non-Hispanic White individuals will no longer be a demographic majority
by about 2041 ­ obtaining more accurate measures of artistic activities that are meaningful
to a more diverse population will be of increasing importance for public policy-making. To
better understand the extent to which the SPPA's questions capture the range of artistic
activities engaged in by members of immigrant communities, we cognitively tested a subset
of the survey's questions with Chinese immigrants to the USA as a pilot case. We found
that interviewees participate in a range of culturally specific and non-culturally specific arts
activities that they did not report in response to the survey's questions. In this article, we
draw upon these interviews to discuss the reasons underpinning the gap and suggest
implications for updating research tools and future research. A better understanding of the
gap between measured and actual "arts participation" will lead to improved measures and
information to support artistic expression and arts more reflective of contemporary society.

Introduction
Individuals express themselves artistically through many means and engage with art in numerous
ways. Such expression includes attending arts events, consuming artistic products, and creating,
collecting, curating and practicing cultural traditions that involve aesthetic expression. Although
the domain of artistically expressive activity is evolving due to technological advances and is
complex due to the varied contexts and motivations for these behaviors, available survey data
capture only a fraction of this activity. In general, available survey data provide a largely reduc-
tionist view that places disproportionate emphasis on the consumption of cultural products stem-
ming from a Western European tradition. The origins of such bias are that consumptive activities
can be relatively straightforwardly defined and thus measured (UNESCO Institute for Statistics,
2012, p. 11). While the challenges associated with reliably measuring the broad domain of artis-
tically expressive activity are readily acknowledged, the growing gap between what is measured
and what people value and do with art is a growing concern.

In the USA, the National Endowment for the Arts' (NEA) periodic Survey of Public Partici-
pation in the Arts (SPPA) is the primary source of data on adult arts participation. The SPPA has
been fielded approximately every five years since 1982 and while questions have been amended
and expanded over time, the changes made to the most recent survey instrument fielded in 2012
are the most substantial to date. In particular, the NEA added questions designed to collect infor-
mation on new ways that individuals create and interact with arts online in order to measure a
broader array of arts participation behaviors taking place in the USA. However, the SPPA's instru-
ment continues its emphasis on arts attendance, which was originally intended to provide insights
to non-profit arts organizations about their health (Novak-Leonard et al., 2014; Orend, 1977;
Tepper & Gao, 2008). The SPPA's aggregate measure of attendance at benchmark arts ­ which
includes having attended a ballet, classical music, jazz, opera, musicals or plays, or visiting an
art museum during the prior 12 months ­ has remained consistent throughout the survey's
history and makes the survey unmatched in its facilitation of long-term trend analysis of arts
attendance in the USA (Pettit, 2000). Nonetheless, the focus on measures of consumptive behav-
ior is problematic for measuring arts-related behaviors within minority1 and immigrant commu-
nities (Novak-Leonard & Brown, 2011; Rosenstein, 2005).
As the USA nears a historic demographic shift to being a majority­minority nation, more
inclusive and accurate measures of arts participation within minority and immigrant communities
become increasingly important for empowering cultural researchers and informing public policy-
making. By approximately 2041, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that non-Hispanic Whites will
no longer comprise the majority of the American public (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013b). Hispanics
are projected to comprise approximately 30 per cent of the US population, Blacks/African Amer-
icans about 13 per cent and Asians/Pacific Islanders about 8 per cent (Farrell & Medvedeva,
2010). Historically, the data captured by the SPPA have suggested that arts participation is dispro-
portionately undertaken by non-Hispanic Whites and early analysis of the 2012 SPPA's data
suggests the same (DiMaggio & Ostrower, 1992; National Endowment for the Arts, 1999,
2014; Nichols, 2003; Welch & Kim, 2010).2
The SPPA has been deemed inadequate for measuring arts-related behaviors within minority
and immigrant communities for two key reasons. First, the SPPA's emphasis on arts attendance,
given that members of immigrant communities tend to favor participatory forms of engaging with
art (Alvarez, 2005; Moriarty, 2008; Rosenstein, 2005; Wali, Severson, & Longoni, 2002). Rosen-
stein (2005, p. 3) argues that "the relatively narrow and passive definitions of arts participation
used in the [SPPA] disproportionately affect the results measured among Hispanics and people
who are not white, systematically producing lower rates of arts participation among these
groups". Additionally, studies using attendance measures typically find that higher levels of edu-
cational attainment and income strongly predict participation while race and ethnicity have little
net predictive power (Love & Klipple, 1995; Welch & Kim, 2010), but recent research that looks
closely at measures of participatory forms of engaging with art finds that identifying as a minority
or as an immigrant has significant net effects on participation (Novak-Leonard, Reynolds,
English, & Bradburn, 2015). A second reason is the implied meaning of the term "arts partici-
pation", which connotes Western artistic forms, and the practical emphasis on these forms,
given significance of the benchmark arts for trend analysis (Novak-Leonard et al., 2014). In
some minority and immigrant communities, the concept of "art" is not distinct from the aesthetic
elements of daily, cultural or ritual practice (Brown, 2001; Jones, 1971; Novak-Leonard et al.,
2014). However, relatively little research has looked at this in depth or as it relates to studying
"arts participation".3 While this lack of clarity between what is artistic and what is a meaningful
activity or object that embodies aesthetic qualities or creative expression applies across society,
understanding how these distinctions are meaningful is particularly important for "arts partici-
pation" research relevant to racial and ethnic minority groups within the USA.

In this investigation, we applied cognitive testing to the 2012 SPPA in order to elucidate the
process by which immigrants perceive and respond to these questions about arts participation.
The SPPA's instruments have previously been subject to pilot testing with general population
samples, but, to our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore how members of immigrant com-
munities understand the SPPA's questions (Keegan, 1987; Robinson, Keegan, Karth, & Triplett,
1987; Triplett, 2011). Specifically, we sought to understand whether immigrants would report cul-
turally specific activities in response to the SPPA's questions and if not, why not. As researchers
and federal agencies seek to update their surveys of arts participation and develop complementary
forms of research, on the basis of our pilot case, we argue that greater attention needs to be paid to
the forms of artistic and aesthetic expression that are happening within and across diverse popu-
lations. This pilot study thus provides a foundation for developing improved and different
research tools for understanding and measuring "arts participation".
Methodology
The objective of our study was to discover the extent to which the SPPA captures arts engagement
within immigrant communities and to describe the reasons underlying any identified gaps. As a
case for studying immigrants in the USA more generally, this article draws upon interviews con-
ducted with 14 adult Chinese-Americans and Chinese immigrants who reside, work or utilize
immigrant social services in Chinatown in Chicago, Illinois in the USA.4 Eleven interviewees
were recruited with the help of the Chinese American Service League, a social service agency
for Chinese-American immigrants, and three interviewees were recruited by the Chinese-Amer-
ican Museum of Chicago. Both organizations are located in the heart of Chicago's Chinatown.
Interviews were conducted onsite at each location in February and March 2014, and were con-
ducted with the assistance of translators who spoke English, Mandarin and Cantonese. Intervie-
wees were paid a $10 incentive to participate and each interview lasted approximately 45 minutes.
Interviewees were asked a subset of questions from the 2012 SPPA's question series about
attendance at arts events and about making art. Given the importance of the benchmark arts
throughout the SPPA's history, these questions were used in the interviews. The subset of ques-
tions about making art were primarily selected on the basis that they had been used relatively con-
sistently across the SPPA's waves. Table 1 lists the SPPA's questions tested in the interviews.
Although the question about social dancing is new to the 2012 SPPA, it captured one of the
highest rates of arts participation at 32 per cent (National Endowment for the Arts, 2014).
Interviews were semi-structured and used probing questions in an attempt to establish context
and motivation for the responses. Interviewers used concurrent and retrospective verbal probing
techniques (Willis, 1999). The probes included asking interviewees to describe specific instances
or events that they thought about before answering the question, and specific instances or events
they excluded from their response. Interviewees were asked about where, with whom, and at what
time of year the activities occurred, and about why the interviewee engaged in the activity
(Brown, 2006; McCarthy, Ondaatje, Zakaras, & Brooks, 2004). In addition, we asked an open-
ended question about the interviewees' involvement in any activities that they considered to be
"creative, cultural or artistic" (Novak-Leonard et al., 2015).
"Does this count?"
From the interview data, we find a gap between what interviewees reported they do in terms of
arts participation in response to the SPPA's questions and the reality of what they do. While inter-
viewees' direct answers to the SPPA's questions suggested low levels of arts participation, all the
interviewees revealed that they participated in additional artistic and creative activities via
114 J.L. Novak-Leonard et al.
Downloaded by [52.6.120.158] at 05:56 28 May 2015
subsequent probes. The gap between the direct responses given to the SPPA's questions and inter-
viewees' actual activities seemed to stem from interviewees' uncertainty about what the SPPA's
questions implied about what counts as "arts participation". Interviewers were instructed to accept
all responses and to clarify for interviewees that they were welcome to share anything that came to
mind during the interview. However, despite this openness, interviewees projected awareness that
they were operating without a clear understanding of what was intended by the survey questions.
A third of the interviewees explicitly asked "does [this] count?"
In response to a question about visiting an art museum or a gallery during the past year, a middle-
aged man who primarily spoke Mandarin in the interview, quickly replied "yes", and listed the Field
Museum, the Chicago Children's Museum, Adler Planetarium and the Chicago History Museum.
The interviewer then asked him whether he visited any galleries in the past 12 months. He
replied that he attended an exhibition of Chinese calligraphy at a library, but that he was not sure
whether that could be counted as a visit to a gallery. Once probed about his own thoughts, he con-
cluded that it should count as a visit to a gallery and ultimately added that he thought of things with
historical and cultural significance when he heard the terms "museum" and "gallery".
When a middle-aged interviewee was asked if she took any "photographs as an artistic
activity", she wanted to know whether pictures of "daily life when she goes outside" counted.
She qualified her responses by saying that she was not sure if she would have the "right
answers", and although the interviewers tried to reassure her, there was no right answer, she
appeared to remain unconvinced. In her later comments, she implied that she thought there
were correct answers to questions about arts participation.

One interviewee explained more explicitly that certain activities would not count as a
response to the SPPA's questions because the activity was not adequately formal. For example,
one older male interviewee believed that for an activity to count as a response it "must be a
public event". He added that private activities were too ambiguous to define, as they were
subject to the personal definition of the participants and could be either artistic or not. Throughout
the interview, he remained firm in his belief, further elaborating that for acting and singing per-
formances, the performance must be on a public stage.
From an etic perspective, these examples suggest that the interviewees are engaged in artistic
and cultural activities; however, these individuals are uncertain whether these activities are legit-
imate activities when responding to the SPPA's questions. In one case, the interviewee is adamant
about the kinds of activities that do not fit within the implied definitional boundaries of the SPPA's
questions. In the following sections, we discuss reasons underlying the uncertainty that emerge
from the interview data.
Questioning culturally specific activities
Chinese culture is generally recognized as one rich in arts, in both traditional and contemporary
forms. Multiple interviewees reported engaging in activities rooted in Chinese culture, yet only a
few explained that they included these activities when formulating direct responses to the SPPA's
questions.
Six interviewees shared that they do calligraphy, but they shared differing views as to whether it
counts as art. When asked if he had created any "visual art, such as paintings, sculpture or graphic
designs", a middle-aged interviewee quickly answered "no". However, when the interviewer asked
him if he could "extend the realm of visual art to anything he did in the past 12 months involving
visual or graphic works", he answered that he did Chinese calligraphy. In response to the same
SPPA question, another interviewee who immigrated over 10 years ago hesitated before answering
"no". Later in the interview, she shared that she did calligraphy. The interviewer asked her why,
since she practiced calligraphy, did she answer "no" to the previous question asking about
visual arts in the last 12 months. She responded that she was unclear about what "visual art"
entailed. She explained, " ... calligraphy is extremely dependent on the hand and gestures from
the hand, ... whereas visual art is something that you look at". This same interviewee shared
that she tied knots as a traditional Chinese art form. She finds the knots to be visually pretty and
enjoys looking at and trying to replicate them, but seemed uneasy about considering it to be a
means of engaging with art despite her appreciation of its aesthetics. She initially learned knot
tying as physical therapy for her fingers while she was in the hospital back in Hong Kong. She
said she found the activity fun and especially enjoyed the handmade aspect. Knot tying also
gave her an opportunity to interact with friends. She said that when she gathers with her friends,
everyone shares what they have learned and shows the knots they have already completed.
In another interview, when asked, "During the last 12 months, did you do any acting?", the
middle-aged interviewee answered in Chinese, and the translator responded, "she [the intervie-
wee] mentioned Tai Chi, but no acting". The interviewer then asked if she considered Tai Chi
as more of a dance, or if she does it for exercise. The translator responded after the interviewee
spoke, "For fitness ­ she does that every night".
Many of the activities interviewees engage in are hard to classify using Western definitions of
art forms. As both Rosenstein (2005) and Moriarty (2004) point out, the culturally rooted arts activi-
ties of immigrant communities differ from the benchmark arts activities in the sense that they are
often more participatory. Furthermore, individuals from immigrant communities show "clear differ-
ence[s] in attitudes about artistic or creative engagement" when compared to others from the
majority culture of a host country (Rosenstein, 2005, p. 3). Therefore, their activities do not fit
116 J.L. Novak-Leonard et al.
Downloaded by [52.6.120.158] at 05:56 28 May 2015
neatly into the categories of a survey instrument that has not been designed with such activities in
mind. As a result, these activities may show up as survey responses in an unexpected place, such as
Tai Chi being given in response to a question about acting, or they may not show up at all.
Questioning the importance of artistic intentions
A second explanation for the uncertainty about "what counts" as a response to the SPPA's ques-
tions is questioning whether activities undertaken for reasons besides expressing one's self artis-
tically or to consume others' artistic creations count. This relates to our first suggested
explanation, but goes beyond culturally rooted activities. In cases such as these, one might
look at the motivation behind an activity to determine the degree of its creative or artistic
nature or intent, but as has been found in other research, motivations are mixed, and not
always conscious (Belfiore & Bennett, 2007). The following responses were offered with some
reluctance.
In response to the question, "In the last 12 months, did you do any work with leather, metal, or
wood?", a middle-aged interviewee responded that she built a desk for her daughter. When asked
about her reasons for building the desk, the interviewee explained she did it for functional and
creative reasons,
... I think it's more satisfying for myself so I get what I want, and cheaper, and more comfortable for
myself because I know what I want and what I need. If I want a special design, it's more expensive, so
why not do it? Because, I can.
Another middle-aged interviewee gave a similar response in discussing photographs she took of a
children's performance of traditional Chinese dances. She noted that, on the one hand, the chil-
dren were wearing traditional costumes, and they looked very beautiful, and she wanted to pre-
serve the celebration of Chinese culture. On the other hand, "children grow up very quickly and I
wanted to be able to capture the moment and have good memories".
Of the 14 respondents, seven interviewees reported practicing weaving, crocheting, quilting,
needlepoint, knitting, or sewing, but for differing motivations. One interviewee, a middle-aged
woman, shared that she really liked sewing and explained that she makes hair accessories for
her daughter and other embellishments for her daughter's clothes, such as flowers that can be
attached to skirts. However, another respondent explained that the sewing she had done in the
past 12 months was only to help mend a garment if someone at home had a tear in his or her
clothes and wanted to know if that "counted". Fixing things was also the motivation for
another interviewee. Also of middle age, when asked about leatherwork, metalwork or wood-
work, he answered that he rarely did these works for artistic purposes. For practical reasons,
though, the interviewee had worked with metal or wood more than 10 times in the past 12
months. When asked to describe his work with metal and wood, he mentioned using nails to
fix things. As for woodwork, he mentioned that he sometimes mends furniture and chairs.
Three interviewees cited health benefits as their main motivation for engaging in Tai Chi, tra-
ditional lion dancing, and kung fu, but also recognized each of these as a culturally based art. One
interviewee began lion dancing with a performance group about 10 years prior, while she was still
living in Hong Kong. Since coming to Chicago, however, she no longer performs at public events,
but practices lion dancing as a way to exercise. Another interviewee explained that she practices
Tai Chi and light kung fu exercise every morning, as she explained "[to] feel the energy flow all
over the body".
Three of our interviewees were parents who reported that their only motivation for attending
museums or concerts was to expose their children to the arts and spend time with them. In
Cultural Trends 117
Downloaded by [52.6.120.158] at 05:56 28 May 2015
response to a question asking about attending any museum or gallery in the last 12 months, one
interviewee responded that she had visited multiple museums with her daughter and that the learn-
ing opportunities for her daughter were important to her. Another respondent confirmed that she
attended concerts in the park during the summer. When the interviewer asked her why she and her
friends wanted to go with their children, she replied that she and the other parents wanted to
expose their children to as many kinds of culture and music as possible.
Six of the 14 interviewees reported singing karaoke when asked if they have sung in the past
12 months. One interviewee mentioned that he goes to his friend's house for karaoke every other
month. An older interviewee thinks that karaoke is especially important as it allows her to spend
time with people who matter to her.
The interviewees' responses suggest some ambiguity about how central the "arts" must be to
the activity or experience to qualify it as counting for a response to the SPPA's questions. This
creates an interesting juxtaposition with existing literature that discusses the range of motivations
for engaging in various arts-related activities, including promoting one's physical and mental
health and, namely, social interactions (Blume-Kohout, Leonard, & Novak-Leonard, 2015;
Lena & Lindemann, 2014; Moriarty, 2004). Understanding the broad range of ways that experi-
ences with arts and culture bring value to individuals is an explicit priority for the NEA (National
Endowment for the Arts, 2012b); however, the interview data suggest that individuals may be fil-
tering their responses to the SPPA's questions based on these same values and motivations when
they feel that the "art" in the activity does not meet an implied threshold of artistic intention or
awareness.
Limitations
This study takes an initial step toward elucidating the gap between what the SPPA captures in
terms of arts engagement within immigrant communities and the reality. However, we recognize
the limitations of this pilot study. The primary limitations to this study are considerations about
translation and its limited sample. For the interviews, a subset of the SPPA's questions was trans-
lated into Mandarin and Cantonese and we acknowledge the complications introduced when
translating a survey instrument (Berkanovic, 1980; Davidov & De Beuckelaer, 2010). As is the
challenge with translations generally, direct translation does not always clearly convey the
intended meaning. Further research is warranted to understand how well the terminology used
in the SPPA translates, literally and conceptually, into other languages.
Our sample is limited to one specific community of immigrants and is modest in its size. The
emergent themes from this pilot study should be tested with larger samples and refined through
additional interviews with other immigrant communities. Additionally, while questions about the
artistic intent of an activity emerged from our interviews with an immigrant sample, further testing
is warranted to understand the generalizability of this finding to the whole of the US population.
Discussion
While this article focused on immigrant communities, several core concepts apply to the US
population at large. Across society, addressing the gap between measured arts participation and
actual engagement in artistic expression represents a contemporary policy priority (Rife, King,
Thomas, & Li, 2014). Given that many policy decisions are reliant on quantitative measures of
arts participation, greater clarity about the strengths and limitations of tools measuring arts par-
ticipation is important for well-informed public policy.
In this study, we summarize a pilot set of cognitive interviews with members of the Chinese
immigrant community as a case of immigrant communities. The results help inform why there is a
118 J.L. Novak-Leonard et al.
Downloaded by [52.6.120.158] at 05:56 28 May 2015
gap between the arts participation behavior captured by the SPPA's data within minority and
immigrant communities and actual engagement with arts and culture. Even though this research
is a pilot, it identifies several important questions that should be considered for measuring "arts
participation".
What is currently being measured? The SPPA serves as the preeminent source of data on how
adults in the USA engage in art and cultural activities; however, it is important to understand the
extent to which it captures the true nature of people's engagement with arts and culture. In this
pilot study, we determined that even describing the survey as one about "arts participation"
evoked notions about a limited set of qualifying activities and biased responses. Multiple inter-
viewees did not think that their activities qualified as appropriate activities to report in response
to the survey questions, despite the interviewees explicitly valuing the aesthetic and creative
aspects of the activity, which seem like characteristics germane to much "arts participation".
At a minimum, this pilot investigation suggests that future surveys on arts participation should
include questions worded in a broader and more inclusive fashion. Currently, the SPPA's ques-
tions about attendance at arts events largely ask about events of specific artistic genres, such as
ballet or classical music, as opposed to asking more generally about dance or music, respectively.
When more broadly stated arts participation survey questions have been employed in other
research, the distribution of participants more closely reflects the racial and ethnic composition
of the population (Novak-Leonard et al., 2015; Rosenstein, 2005), suggesting that such
broader question phrasing reduces racial and ethnic bias in survey responses.
But, this alsoraises questions aboutthe types of research needed as society and"art" evolve to be
clear about what is being measured with existing survey tools, what information is needed for
policy-making purposes, and what are the most appropriate methods for developing this knowledge.
What needs to be understood? If research and policy communities are aiming to understand
the range of ways that people in the USA engage in art and cultural activities, then this pilot study
suggests that more research is needed to understand multiple cultural frames of reference; what
activities are considered to be artistic, creative and cultural within those frames; and the values
that people derive from those experiences. This pilot suggests that interviewees were operating
with an awareness that they did not have a good grasp of what might be deemed American
arts participation, and in their survey responses, these individuals endeavored to describe their
own activities with respect to that perceived frame of reference. As the demographic composition
of the USA shifts to majority­minority, what might be deemed as American arts participation
may shift and more research is needed to understand what creative and cultural activities
matter to people living within the USA.

coming from Mexico. Individuals of Chinese ethnicity represent almost a quarter (24 per cent) of the
Asian population living in the USA (Pew Research Center, 2013).
