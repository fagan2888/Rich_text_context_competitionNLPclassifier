abstract
OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in early
childhood and teacher-reported academic and behavioral problems in kindergarten.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Fragile Families and Child
Wellbeing Study, a national urban birth cohort. Subjects with primary caregiver-reported
information on ACE exposures ascertained at 5 years and teacher-reported outcomes at the
end of the child's kindergarten year were included. Outcomes included teacher ratings of
academic skills, emergent literacy skills, and behavior. We included 8 ACE exposures on the
basis of the original Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Kaiser study and created
an ACE score by summing individual adversities. We examined the associations between
teacher-reported academic and behavioral outcomes and ACE scores by using logistic
regression.
RESULTS: In the study sample, 1007 children were included. Fifty-five percent had
experienced 1 ACE and 12% had experienced  3. Adjusting for potential confounders,
experiencing  3 ACEs was associated with below-average language and literacy skills
(adjusted odds ratio [AORs]: 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1­2.9) and math skills
(AOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1­2.9), poor emergent literacy skills, attention problems (AOR: 3.5, 95%
CI: 1.8­6.5), social problems (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4­5.0), and aggression (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI:
1.2­4.6).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of urban children, experiencing ACEs in early childhood was
associated with below-average, teacher-reported academic and literacy skills and behavior
problems in kindergarten. These findings underscore the importance of integrated
approaches that promote optimal development among vulnerable children.

WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Adverse
childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with
poor health outcomes in children and adults. Little is
known regarding links between adverse experiences
in early childhood and academic and behavioral
outcomes in kindergarten.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: ACEs in early childhood
were associated with poor academic skills and
behavior problems in kindergarten, which are
strong predictors of educational trajectory. These
findings underscore the importance of integrated
approaches for addressing the developmental needs
of vulnerable young children.
JIMENEZ et al
Early childhood experiences lay the
foundation for well-being throughout
the life course.1 The rapid pace of
child development and brain growth
from birth through age 5 make it a
critical time period of opportunity
and vulnerability.2 Several studies
have linked adverse childhood
experiences (ACEs), broadly defined
as household dysfunction and abuse,
to poor health outcomes.3­7 More
recent work has linked ACEs with
lower levels of school engagement in
middle childhood and adolescence.8
Most studies linking ACEs to poor
outcomes rely on adult recall of
events before age 18 and provide
limited information about exposures
taking place in the critical birth-to-
age-5 time period. Although ACEs
in early childhood have been linked
to poor physical health outcomes,9
little is known regarding associations
between early childhood ACEs and
developmental and behavioral
outcomes.
To address this gap, we used a unique
birth cohort to explore associations
between ACEs and academic skills
including literacy and behavior in
kindergarten. We focus on these
outcomes in kindergarten because
academic skills and behaviors at
that time point are strong predictors
of educational trajectory.10 We
hypothesized that ACEs in the
birth-to-age-5 time period would
be associated with poor teacher-
reported academic skills including
emergent literacy and behavior
difficulties.
METHODS
Study Design and Data Source
We conducted a secondary analysis
of data from the Fragile Families and
Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS). The
FFCWS birth cohort consists of nearly
5000 children born between 1998
and 2000 in 20 large US cities.11,12
By design, most children in the study
were born to unmarried parents.
This longitudinal data set includes
postpartum interviews with mothers
and fathers, follow-up interviews
with parents ~1, 3, 5, and 9 years
after the child's birth, and in-home
child assessments and educator
interviews at key time points. A more
detailed description can be found
elsewhere.11,12 The current study
utilizes data on ACEs reported in the
mother's 5-year follow-up interview
(which took place when the child
was 61 months old, on average), as
well as data on teacher-reported
school performance in the last month
of the child's kindergarten year.
Because mothers were asked to recall
information about past exposures
and the teacher interviews occurred
well after the mother's interviews,
the exposures clearly preceded the
outcomes.
Study Population
The study sample was limited to
children for whom teacher-reported
outcomes as well as primary
caregiver-report information on 8
ACE exposures on the basis of the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Kaiser ACE study13 were
available. Given 98% of primary
caregivers in the sample were
biological mothers, we refer to them
generically as mothers in this article.
Outcomes
Teacher-Reported Academic Outcomes
The children's teachers were
asked to rate the child's academic
skills during the last month of
the child's kindergarten year on
a 5-point Likert scale ("far below
average" to "far above average")
in the following: (1) literacy, (2)
science and social studies, and (3)
math. We created a dichotomous
variable ("far below average" or
"below average" versus all others).
To explore literacy in depth, we also
analyzed teacher-rated emergent
literacy skills during the last month
of kindergarten. Teachers rated these
skills on a 5-point Likert scale ("not
yet" to "proficient") and answers
were dichotomized to "not yet" or
"beginning" versus all others.
Teacher-Reported Behavior Problems
Teachers were asked to describe
child classroom behavior during
the last month of kindergarten
by using questions from the Child
Behavior Checklist.14 Teachers
rated statements about child
behavior as "not true," "somewhat
or sometimes true," and "very
true or often true" for the child.
Scores were summed for each of
3 subscales (attention problems,
social problems, and aggression)
assigning values of 1 for not true, 2
for somewhat or sometimes true,
and 3 for very true or often true, with
higher scores representing greater
behavior difficulties. We created a
dichotomous variable for scores in
the top 10th percentile versus lower.
Missing data for outcome variables
ranged from 0.5% to 2.8%.
Exposures
ACE measures were created from
maternal reports at 5 years. These
covered 9 out of the 10 ACEs included
in the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention Kaiser ACE study,13
although emotional and physical
neglect were characterized by using a
single measure because the available
information did not allow us to
distinguish between the 2. We did not
include parental divorce/separation
as an ACE because the FFCWS
oversampled nonmarital births, and
recent qualitative work with urban
youth did not endorse parental
divorce/separation as an ACE
because many children had parents
who were never married.15 Overall,
our measures of ACEs included 4
categories of child maltreatment
(physical, sexual, psychological
abuse, and neglect) and 4 categories
of household dysfunction (substance
use, mental illness, caregiver treated
violently, and incarceration).
Individual ACEs were dichotomized
as exposed or not and then summed
2
PEDIATRICS Volume 137, number 2, February 2016
to create a score ranging from 0 to
8. We then created a categorical
variable consisting of "0," "1," "2," and
"3" ACEs on the basis of the sample
distribution.
Child Maltreatment
The FFWCS contains information
regarding child maltreatment in 2
forms: (1) The mother was directly
asked whether Child Protective
Services (CPS) had been contacted
for the child regarding physical,
sexual abuse and/or neglect since
the child was born, and (2) mothers
completed the Parent-Child Conflict
Tactics Scale(CTS-PC)16 in reference
to their own behavior and the child's
secondary caregiver's behavior (if
applicable). The CTS-PC screens
for child maltreatment and has 3
relevant domains: psychological
aggression, physical assault, and
neglect. The FFCWS includes 5
items about physical assault (eg,
hit, slapped), 5 items about neglect
(eg, failure to provide supervision),
and 5 items regarding psychological
aggression (eg, threatened). The
mother was asked how many times
each behavior occurred in the
past year. Based on past work,17,18
responses were assigned a score (0
for never or not in the past year, 1 for
event occurred once, 2 for twice, 4
for 3­5 times, 8 for 6­10 times, 15 for
11­20 times, and 25 for > 20 times),
and we created a dichotomous
variable considering domain scores
in the top 10th percentile as high risk
for maltreatment.
Psychological aggression was
considered present on the basis of
the CTS-PC score for the mother
and/or secondary caregiver.
Neglect and physical abuse were
considered positive on the basis of
the CTS-PC score for the mother
and/or secondary caregiver and/
or if the mother reported CPS
involvement for the relevant
domain.
Sexual abuse was considered
positive if the mother reported CPS
involvement for sexual abuse.
Household Dysfunction
Mental illness: Maternal depressive
symptoms, which were included
under the "mental illness" category
in the original ACE study,13 were
assessed with the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview-
Short Form. The Composite
International Diagnostic Interview-
Short Form has been used in
past studies and categorizes
respondents as having experienced
a depressive episode in the past 12
months on the basis of Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria.19
Substance use: Mothers were asked,
"In the past 12 months, was there
ever a time when your drinking or
being hung over interfered with
your work at school, or a job, or
at home?" and "Did you use any
of these drugs during the past 12
months?" They were also asked
whether the biological father and
current partner if applicable "had
problems such as keeping a job
or getting along with family and
friends because of alcohol or drug
use?" An affirmative response
for the mother, father, or current
live-in partner was considered an
exposure.
Incarceration: Incarceration was
assessed by maternal report of
whether the child's father had
spent time in prison or jail in the
past 2 years, whether a current
live-in partner spent most of the
previous week in jail or prison, and
whether she had been convicted
of a crime during the past 2 years.
Although conviction does not
always result in incarceration, it
still may cause turbulence in the
child's life. An affirmative response
for any of these was considered an
exposure.
Caregiver treated violently: This
information was based on
questions that were drawn from
the Conflict Tactic Scale, as well as
qualitative interviews with victims
of domestic violence20 and have
been used in other studies.21,22
Questions explored physical and
sexual violence (eg, slap or kicks,
hits with fist, tries to make you
have sex) by the biological father
or current partner in the past year.
A reply of "sometimes" or "often"
to any items as opposed to "never"
was considered an exposure.
We also considered whether the
mother had a physical fight with
the biological father or current
partner (if applicable) in front of
the child in the past 2 years and
whether she had been seriously
hurt in a fight with the father or
current partner (if applicable),
with an affirmative response
considered an exposure.
Covariates
Guided by past studies,6,7,9 we
controlled for the child's age (in
months) and gender, the mother's
race and ethnicity, the mother's
education and the relationship
status of the parents at the time of
child's birth, and household income
at the time of the 5-year follow-up
(dichotomized based on the poverty
threshold for a family of 4). We used
an imputed variable for household
income provided by the FFCWS given
the degree of missing data (~10%).12
Supplementary models included
birth weight, maternal report of the
child's health status, and the number
of siblings as covariates.
Statistical Analysis
First, we computed sample
characteristics. Next, we assessed
independent variables for
colinearity and found none to be
highly correlated (r  0.7). Then
we estimated both unadjusted and
adjusted logistic regression models
of associations between ACEs and
the outcomes of interest. Finally, we
assessed sensitivity to construction
3
JIMENEZ et al
of key measures and model
specification. We used Stata 13 (Stata
Corp, College Station, TX) to conduct
all analyses.
The Rutgers Biomedical Health
Sciences Institutional Review Board
determined this study to be exempt.
RESULTS
Study Sample
Eighty-five percent (4055) of
mothers in the original FFCWS
sample completed 5-year follow-up
interviews. Of those, 1007 (our
analysis sample) had available data
from their children's kindergarten
teachers and mother-reported
information on ACEs. At 5 years, 97%
of mothers in our sample reported
living with their child most of the
time, 26% reported a romantic
relationship with a new partner, and
56% of mothers with new partners
reported living with their current
partner most of the time (results not
shown).
Sociodemographic characteristics of
the study sample are summarized
in Table 1 along with corresponding
measures for the full 5-year follow-up
sample. Almost half of children in the
sample were African American and
one quarter were Latino. Although
only 27% of the mothers were
married to the father of the child at
the time of the birth, the majority
of parents (93%) had some kind
of a relationship. Socioeconomic
characteristics were similar for the 2
samples.
Forty-five percent of the children had
no ACEs, 27% had 1 ACE, 16% had 2
ACEs, and 12% had 3 (Table 2). The
most common ACEs were exposure
to incarceration and physical
and psychological abuse. African
American children and children
with family income <$20000 were
more likely than their non-African
American and higher income
counterparts to experience at least 1
ACE (Supplemental Table 6).
Approximately one quarter of the
children had below-average teacher-
rated literacy skills and math skills
(Table 3). Not yet or beginning
ratings by teachers ranged from 10%
to 26% for emergent literacy skills
(Table 4). A general pattern of worse
academic, literacy, and behavior
outcomes with increased number of
ACEs is apparent (Tables 3, 4, and
5). The average number of ACEs for
children with poor academic and
behavioral outcomes was higher for
all outcomes examined (1.2­1.54)
compared with those without
(0.92­0.97).
Logistic Regression Analysis
In unadjusted models, experiencing
1 ACE was associated with poor
teacher-reported language and
literacy skills (odds ratio [OR]:
1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]:
1.1­2.1), science and social studies
skills (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1­2.4), and
math skills (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1­2.3),
as well as not yet or beginning to
understand and interpret a story
or other text read to the child (OR:
1.6, 95% CI: 1.04­2.4). We also
found that 1 ACE was associated

with teacher-reported attention
problems (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1­3.3)
and aggressive behavior (OR:
1.9, 95% CI: 1.1­3.2). With few
exceptions, increased ACEs were
associated with increased odds
of below-average academic skills
and behavior problems. Exposure
to 3 ACEs was associated with
below-average academic skills
(Table 3), literacy skills (Table 4),
and behavior problems (Table 5) for
all outcomes examined. Although
many associations between 2
ACEs and outcomes were no longer
statistically significant, adjusting for
potential confounders changed the
ORs only minimally. Treating ACEs
as a continuous variable resulted in
statistically significant associations
between ACEs and all outcomes
examined in unadjusted analyses
with ORs ranging from 1.18 to 1.45
and minimal change after adjusting
for potential confounders.
Results were insensitive to
treating missing ACE information

DISCUSSION
In a national urban sample,
experiencing ACEs in early childhood
was associated with poor teacher-
reported academic and behavioral
outcomes in kindergarten. Relative to
children with no ACEs, children who
experienced ACEs had increased odds
of having below-average academic
skills including poor literacy skills,
as well as attention problems,
social problems, and aggression,
placing them at significant risk for
poor school achievement, which is
associated with poor health.23 Our
study adds to the growing literature
on adverse outcomes associated
with ACEs3­9,24­28 by pointing to
ACEs during early childhood as a
risk factor for child academic and
behavioral problems that have
implications for education and health
trajectories, as well as achievement
gaps and health disparities.
Our findings add insight into the
pathways linking early childhood
adversity to poor adult wellbeing.29
Complementing past work that
focused on physical health,9 our
findings provide information
about links between ACEs and
early childhood outcomes at the
intersection of learning, behavior,
and health.29 We found that ACEs
experienced in early childhood were
associated with poor foundational
skills, such as language and literacy,
that predispose individuals to low
educational attainment and adult
literacy, both of which are related
to poor health.23,30­33 Attention
problems, social problems, and
aggression were also associated with
ACEs and also have the potential to
interfere with children's educational
experience given known associations
between self-regulatory behavior
and academic achievement.34,35
Consistent with the original ACE
study and subsequent research,
we found that exposure to more
ACEs was associated with more
adverse outcomes, suggesting a
dose­response association.3­8 In fact,
experiencing 3 ACEs was associated
with below-average performance
or problems in every outcome
examined.
Our findings highlight the cross-
sector nature of the associations
between ACEs and wellbeing.
Given their frequent contact
with children,36 pediatricians
are uniquely positioned to detect
both ACEs and associated adverse
developmental and behavioral
outcomes and to link families to
community resources that can
provide necessary assistance and
foster resilience. Bright Futures, the
AAP health promotion initiative,
provides resources for pediatricians
to detect both ACEs and adverse
developmental outcomes.36
Programs like Reach Out and Read, in
which pediatricians distribute books
and model reading, simultaneously
promote emergent literacy and
parent­child relationships through
shared reading.37,38 However, ACEs
cannot be addressed in isolation
and require collaborative efforts
with partners in the education,
home visitation, and other social
service sectors in synergistic efforts
to strengthen families.29 In this
way, programs like Help Me Grow39
that create streamlined access
to early childhood services for
at-risk children can play a critical
role in building an integrated
system that connects families to
needed resources to enhance the
development of vulnerable children.
Our study is subject to limitations.
Causality cannot be inferred
from our findings. Although we
controlled for several confounders

that had little impact on the
observed associations, there may
be unmeasured factors that account
for the associations between
ACEs in early childhood and end-
of-year kindergarten outcomes.
The study sample was from large
cities; our findings therefore do
not necessarily generalize to all
settings. For example, in a national
sample of kindergarteners in
the spring of the academic year,
95% were considered proficient
in letter recognition.40 In our
sample, ~10% could not yet or
were just beginning to easily
recognize letters. We limited our
sample to children with available
information on ACEs. Although
our estimates were insensitive to
including children with missing
ACEs information and coding them
as not exposed, it is possible that
we underestimated ACEs in our
study. Similarly ACE information
relied on maternal reports and we
used relatively high thresholds for
the standardized scales assessing
child abusive behavior, both of
which could have underestimated
ACEs. We did not include direct
assessments of academic skills.
However, teachers are professionals,
observe many children, and are
independent reporters from the
mothers, and previous work
revealed that teacher assessments
of reading skills in kindergarten are
predictive of outcomes on direct
reading assessments in first and
third grade.41 Finally, richer data
would have enriched the analyses.
Information from the 1- and 3-year
follow-up interviews had insufficient
detail to allow us to incorporate
ACEs ascertained at those time
points. Information on the nature
and characteristics ACEs (eg, timing,
chronicity) was also unavailable. We
were unable to distinguish between
emotional and physical neglect with
our data, and because emotional
neglect is independently associated
with poor outcomes, future work
would benefit from distinguishing
the 2.42 Also we were unable to
consider fathers' and partners'
reports of the mother being violent
against them without a large sample
loss; given that violence often occurs
in both directions,43,44 future work
would benefit by incorporating
this information. Despite
these limitations, the current
study assesses both ACEs and
developmental outcomes by using
several standardized instruments
at important points during a critical
stage of the life course that has been
understudied in this context.
CONCLUSIONS
This study revealed strong links
between ACEs in early childhood and
poor academic readiness by the end
of kindergarten, which place children
at elevated risk for poor educational
achievement and subsequent health.
Thus, adverse outcomes associated
with ACE exposure begin in early
childhood and impact multiple
aspects of children's lives. The
findings from this study underscore
the need for integrated cross-
sector approaches to enhance the
development of vulnerable children.
