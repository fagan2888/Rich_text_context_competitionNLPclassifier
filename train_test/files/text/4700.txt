Alexithymia describes a lack of emotional consciousness
and is often associated with the Asian personality (Dion,
1996; Le, Berenbaum, & Raghavan, 2002; Taylor, Bagby, &
Parker, 1997). From the Asian perspective, this rings hollow.
In particular, the Korean culture rests on a foundation of
"jeong." Jeong is a very difficult concept to translate but it
stresses the emotional connections within intimate relation-
ships and is a central concern for Koreans, permeating one's
private life (Kalton, 1994). This paper aims to explore the
gap between stereotypes of Korean emotional experiences
versus felt emotional experiences within the context of inti-
mate relationships. In addition, we examined how emotional
factors may shift as a function of minority statues within
another culture.
Some studies have demonstrated a negative relationship
between alexithymia and intimate relationships. For exam-
ple, Vanheule, Desmet, and Meganck (2007) examined 561
individuals from clinical and student populations and
assessed how alexithymia was linked to specific interper-
sonal problems. They found that alexithymia was related to
interpersonal distance and nonassertive social functioning.
In addition, Humphreys, Woof, and Parker (2008) found that
higher levels of alexithymia predicted lower relationship sat-
isfaction. Montebarocci, Codispoti, Baldaro, and Rossi
(2003) found that alexithymia was positively related to dis-
comfort in intimacy. Finally, Hesse and Floyd (2008) found
that alexithymia was negatively related to affectionate expe-
rience, happiness, nonverbal immediacy cues, affectionate
communication, and closeness in intimate relationships.
Accordingly, the Western idea of successful intimate rela-
tionships includes both intense emotional experiences
between partners and high emotional intelligence (EI). It has
been assumed that non-Western cultures would also display
a strong positive relationship between relationship satisfac-
tion and intense emotional awareness and encounters
between the partners. However, there is virtually no data on
non-Western cultures to support such generalizations.
Although alexithymia and EI are independent constructs,
there is a significant negative relationship between the two
constructs in the West. For instance, Parker, Taylor, and
Bagby (2001) compared EI scores with alexithymia levels
and found that a significant negative relationship exists
between the two constructs. However, it is possible that in
cultures where harmonious social interactions and the subtle
expression of emotions are highly valued, the inability to

Relationship Satisfaction in Native
Koreans and Korean Americans as a
Function of Alexithymia, Emotional
Intelligence, and Marital Vows Orientation
Victoria Lee1, Linda Berg-Cross1, and Kyung Hyun Suh2
Abstract
The common stereotype of the inexpressive Asian, holding all emotions at bay, continues in our expectations of how Asian
couples relate in intimate relationships. There is also a widely held belief that Asian marriages embrace more covenant-
oriented commitments, compromising individual freedom and expression for the sake of harmony and integration of the
couple. The current study attempted to test these stereotypes among Koreans living in the United States and Native Koreans.
Results indicated that the dominant culture significantly shapes the expression and importance of alexithymia among Koreans,
but when Koreans are a minority group, traditional beliefs may exert an even greater influence on the covenantal aspects of
the couple relationship. Most interestingly, couples with only one Korean member had very different results than the other
groups; most notably in a strong significant negative relationship between emotional intelligence and relationship satisfaction.

experience simple full-blown emotions and overtly express
them can serve as a facilitating factor in social interactions.
Therefore, in Asian culture, the relationship between the two
factors may not be negatively correlated as reported by
researchers studying Western couples.
Another factor that may play a role in this complex link
between culture and intimate relationships is the individuals'
attitudes and values about marriage. Bromley and Bushing
(1988) stated that two distinct types of social relationships
exist; "tribal" (covenantal) and "industrial" (contractual),
reflecting the difference in social relationships among col-
lectivistic and individualistic cultures. Thus, the lack of emo-
tional expression in a spouse may be tolerated less by an
individual who values self-actualization (contractual type)
than in a spouse who values vow-taking (covenantal type).
Also, individuals who see the dyad as the primary unit may
inhibit emotional displays, which could disrupt the harmony
within the relationship.
Method
Measures
All native Koreans were given scales that had been translated
and back-translated. In addition to the demographic form,
the scales administered included the Toronto Alexithymia
Scale (Taylor et al., 1997), Assessing Emotions Scale
(Schutte et al., 1998), Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Spanier,
1976), and Marital Vows Scale (Ripley, Worthington,
Bromley, & Kemper, 2005).
Participants
Thirty-six Korean American couples had a mean age of 32
and a mean relationship length of 7.89 years. The 45 married
Native Korean couples had a mean age of 31 and a mean
relationship length of 11.1 years. The 9 Mixed-Culture cou-
ples consisted of 9 Korean American females, 8 Caucasian
males, and 1 African American male. These 9 couples had a
mean age of 38 and an average relationship length of 14.36
years.
Results
Korean American Couples
Overall, EI was negatively correlated with alexithymia, r =
-.37, p = .00. This indicated that individuals with higher EI
tended to have lower alexithymia. Although the direction of
the relationship was similar to previously found results, the
correlation appeared weaker, although not significantly
weaker, than reported in previous research, r(24) = -.65
(Schutte et al., 1998). EI was negatively correlated with dif-
ficulty identifying feelings, r = -.28, p = .02; difficulty
describing feelings, r = -.39, p = .00; and externally oriented
thinking, r = -.27, p = .02. EI was significantly correlated
with relationship satisfaction, r = .23, p = .05. Relationship
satisfaction was negatively correlated with alexithymia, r =
-.41, p = .00; difficulty identifying feelings, r = -.43, p = .00;
difficulty describing feeling, r = -.31, p = .01; and externally
oriented thinking, r =-.25, p =.03. Relationship satisfaction
was also significantly correlated with marital values, r = .41,
p = .00.
Native Korean Couples
Overall, EI was negatively correlated with alexithymia, r =
-.58, p = .00. This finding was similar to previous research,
r(24) = -.65 (Schutte et al., 1998). EI was negatively corre-
lated with all three factors of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale
(TAS-20): difficulty identifying feelings, r = -.48, p = .00;
difficulty describing feelings, r = -.51, p = .00; and exter-
nally oriented thinking, r = -.48, p = .00.
EI was significantly correlated with relationship satisfac-
tion, r = .52, p = .00. Relationship satisfaction was negatively
correlated with alexithymia, r = -.47, p = .00; difficulty
describing feeling, r = -.35, p = .00; difficulty identifying
feelings, r = -.49, p = .00; and externally oriented thinking,
r = -.26, p = .01. Relationship satisfaction was also signifi-
cantly correlated with marital values, r = .30, p = .00. This
indicates that individuals with more covenantal values
toward marriage reported being more satisfied in their
relationship.
Mixed-Culture Couples
Overall, EI was negatively correlated with relationship satis-
faction, r = -.58, p = .00. No other significant relationships
were found among the variables.
Between-Group Analyses
An ANOVA indicated that the three groups had significantly
different mean alexithymia scores, F(2, 177) = 4.75, p = .01.
Dunnett's C post hoc test indicated that Native Korean cou-
ples (M = 50.19, SD = 10.47) were more alexithymic than
Mixed-Culture couples (M = 43.32, SD = 6.53). Result also
indicated the three groups differed significantly with regard
to their mean EI scores, F(2, 177) = 9.13, p = .00. Tukey's
HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) post hoc analysis
(test of homogeneity of variance was significant only for this
variable) indicated that both Korean American (M = 125.42,
SD = 11.25) and Mixed-Culture couples (M = 125.69, SD =
9.65) were more emotionally intelligent than Native Korean
couples (M = 117.52, SD = 13.82). Analysis of the Dyadic
Adjustment Scale indicated differences among the groups on
relationship satisfaction, F(2, 176) = 2.96, p = .054. Dunnett's
C post hoc analysis indicated that Korean American couples
(M = 111.68, SD = 13.46) were more satisfied in their rela-
tionship than the Native Korean couples (M = 104.96, SD =
20.70). The analysis of Marital Vows scale indicated that
Lee et al. 3
there was a significant difference among the groups on their
values toward marriage, F(2, 173) = 3.36, p = .04. Dunnett's
C post hoc analysis indicated that Korean American couples
(M = 46.50, SD = 5.03) were more covenantal in their view
of marriage than Native Korean couples (M = 44.31, SD =
5.34).
A Fisher r to z transformation revealed that the strength of
the relationship between EI and relationship satisfaction was
significantly different in Korean American and Native
Korean couples, z = -2.11, p = .03. Both were positively cor-
related and statistically significant but the correlation
between the two factors in Native Korean couples was sig-
nificantly stronger (.23 vs. .52). Higher EI was a stronger
predictor of relationship satisfaction in Native Korean cou-
ples than in Korean American couples.
When Korean American couples were compared with
Mixed-Culture couples, the strength of the relationship
between EI and relationship satisfaction was significantly
different as well, z = 3.14, p = .00. The direction of the rela-
tionship was opposite for the two groups and both relation-
ships were statistically significant (.23 vs. -.58). Higher EI
was a predictor of lower relationship satisfaction in Mixed-
Culture couples but in Korean Americans, higher EI pre-
dicted higher relationship satisfaction. Similarly, Native
Korean couples were also significantly different from Mixed-
Culture couples, z = 4.48, p = .00 (r = .52 vs. r = -.58).
Discussion
Korean Americans
The Korean American couples' EI was inversely correlated
with alexithymia. Contrary to what we expected, the findings
on Korean Americans were similar to previous research. This
finding suggests that the relationship between EI and alexi-
thymia generalizes across geographical/ethnic cultural
boundaries.
Within Korean Americans, higher levels of alexithymia
and lower EI predicted less relationship satisfaction. These
two findings replicate previous research and suggest that an
individual's inability to get in touch with and communicate
feelings may result in not getting their needs met with their
partners. This finding confirmed that within romantic rela-
tionships, emotional factors are just as important in Korean
American couples as has been reported in EuropeanAmerican
couples. Perhaps, emotional control is more important for
Asians in public and formal settings whereas more expres-
sive, high-level emotional processing is valued among
Korean Americans motivated to have positive intimate rela-
tionships with their partner.
In regard to views about marriage, Korean Americans
with more covenantal views of marriage reported higher
relationship satisfaction than those who endorsed more con-
tractual views of marriage. This suggests that viewing the
relationship as a whole rather than stressing individual
happiness promotes higher relationship satisfaction among
Korean Americans. Perhaps, the emphasis on the dyad leads
to a more tolerant attitude toward what is perceived as their
partner's faults or interpersonal differences. Also, it is likely
that those who hold covenantal views on marriage have
views more consistent with collectivism or traditions. In
turn, these individuals are more likely to put in the effort to
"make things work." This would lower the likelihood of mar-
ital distress and motivate the individuals to avoid the stigma
of divorce within the community. Furthermore, when indi-
viduals put in a great deal of effort to make things work, but
feel unsatisfied in their relationship, they will experience
cognitive dissonance. To reduce this cognitive dissonance,
they may rationalize away many negative attitudes toward
their partner to feel more satisfied in their relationships. The
overall findings appear similar to previous research on
European Americans.
Native Korean Couples
The Native Korean sample, which included 45 married
couples currently living in the Seoul metropolitan area in
South Korea, yielded surprising results. It was hypothe-
sized that emotional factors would have less of an impact or
differentially impact the relationship satisfaction of Korean
couples living in Korea when compared with the previous
findings. On the contrary, results indicated similar findings
to the previous research. Three of the four significant rela-
tionships among the factors replicated the previous research.
This suggests that these emotional factors do have a similar
impact on intimate relationship beyond Western cultural
boundaries.
EI and alexithymia were negatively correlated, which
indicates that individuals who are more emotionally intelli-
gent tended to have lower levels of alexithymia. The direc-
tion of the relationship was the same as previous research
and the strength of the relationship was similar to previous
research (Schutte et al., 1998). The results indicated that
individuals with higher EI tended to be more satisfied in their
relationships. This finding was also similar to previous find-
ings (Brackett, Warner, & Bosco, 2005; Smith, Ciarrochi, &
Heaven, 2008; Smith, Heaven, & Ciarrochi, 2007). The very
strong relationship between EI and relationship satisfaction
found among Native Koreans compared with Korean
Americans, suggests that contrary to Western stereotypes,
emotional values and sensitivities are vibrant and forceful
among a significant group of Native Koreans. On this one
measure, emotional processing appears to permeate their cul-
tural cognitive style. Also, individuals with higher levels of
alexithymia tended to be less satisfied in their relationship,
which is also consistent with previous research. It appears
that emotional functioning is important in intimate relation-
ships even in a culture where emotional restraint is valued
for the benefit of group harmony. What is most surprising is
that these results held true even though the group, as a whole,
4 SAGE Open
had higher alexithymia levels than the Mixed-Culture cou-
ples and lower EI compared with other two groups.
Covenantal views of marriage were linked to higher rela-
tionship satisfaction in this group. More emphasis on the
dyad seems to promote higher satisfaction.
Mixed-Culture Couples
No significant relationship between alexithymia and EI was
found among the Mixed-Culture sample. Their relationship
between alexithymia and EI is moderated by some still
unknown variables. Furthermore, the small sample size may
have contributed to the nonsignificant finding.
Odder still is that EI and relationship satisfaction were
negatively correlated in the Mixed-Culture couples. This
finding is opposite to what was previously found (Schutte et
al., 2001). Possibly, in Mixed-Culture relationships, the cul-
tural differences are more pronounced for the emotionally
intelligent partner, who is sensitive and aware of the nuances
of cultural and emotional communications, but this aware-
ness is not necessarily related to acceptance. Indeed, high-EI
individuals may be hypersensitive to differences in commu-
nication, rituals, values, and lifestyle.
Discussion
Similar to previous research, EI predicted the magnitude of
relationship satisfaction among individuals. However, the
degree and the direction of influence varied across groups.
Higher EI was a significantly stronger predictor of relation-
ship satisfaction among Native Koreans compared with
Korean Americans, most likely as a function of minority/
majority culture status. Possibly, minority couples (Korean
Americans) with high EI are sensitized to the stereotyped
expectations projected from the majority culture and/or
introject negative stereotypes about their inability to use EI;
both factors which could weaken the relationship between EI
and relationship satisfaction. In addition, as a minority, eco-
nomic success and worries may be contributing more to rela-
tionship satisfaction and eroding some of the impact of EI.
The significantly stronger relationship found in Native
Koreans between EI and relationship satisfaction should help
recast Western notions of the fabric of successful intimate
relationships among Asians.
Surprisingly, in Mixed-Culture couples, an inverse rela-
tionship was found between EI and relationship satisfaction.
Although the sample size was small, the relationship was
very strong. When the relationship between EI and relation-
ship satisfaction was compared between Mixed-Culture cou-
ples and the other groups, higher EI was a predictor of lower
relationship satisfaction in Mixed-Culture couples; but it
predicted higher relationship satisfaction in the other groups.
The most likely reason for this initially surprising finding is
that individuals from different ethnic backgrounds inevitably
experience cultural conflicts and difficulties with disparate
communication styles. The higher their EI, the more likely
these conflicts and differences are to appear on one's radar
screen and prove to be an irritant. Perhaps lack of emotional
insight is protective in such situations and serves to reduce
conflict. It may be a case where ignorance truly is bliss.
Only a few studies have examined Mixed-Culture cou-
ples and the findings are inconsistent. Some findings sug-
gest they may be at more risk of relational dysfunction.
Killian (2001) interviewed 20 participants to examine the
experience of individuals in interracial relationships. The
couples examined were African American­European
American. The results indicated that African American
partners experienced more emotional sensitivity to the
reactions of others regarding their relationship. Presumably,
this insight was more a burden than a blessing to the rela-
tionship--again showing that EI may be of mixed value to
a relationship, depending on the most frequent emotional
cues in the environment.
Furthermore, these findings suggest that Mixed-Culture
couples are more at risk of relational dysfunction. Indeed,
research indicates that 66% of interracial marriages end up
divorced (Gaines & Brennan, 2001), which is higher than the
national average.
Another difference found in the present study concerns
the couples' values orientation toward marriage. Analyses of
each group revealed that having a covenantal view toward
marriage was predictive of relationship satisfaction in
Korean­Korean couples, irrespective of their country of resi-
dence. The relationship between marital values orientation
and relationship satisfaction was not found among Mixed-
Culture couples. The most parsimonious explanation for this
is that among Korean­Korean couples, the more culturally
consistent, traditional views toward marriage are linked to an
individual's cultural/racial identity. Mixed couples, with a
more diverse ethnic identity have a harder time linking philo-
sophical assumptions about marriage with their own rela-
tionship satisfaction.
Unlike EI, results indicated that the impact of alexithymia
on relationship satisfaction was pretty consistent across
Native Koreans and Korean Americans. This pattern was not
replicated in the Mixed-Culture couples. Native Korean cou-
ples were found to be more alexithymic than Mixed-Culture
couples but no differences were found among Korean­
Korean couples living in the United States and in Korea. This
finding is consistent with previous research (Dion, 1996; Le
et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 1997) and suggests that Asians, in
this case Koreans, regardless of their country of residence,
have a higher level of alexithymia as measured by the current
assessment.
Another surprising finding is that, in their orientation
toward marriage, Korean Americans tend to have more cov-
enantal views about marriage than Koreans living in Korea.
Possibly, identification with the stereotypes of marriage from
their country of origin is a protective mechanism for those
living in a country as a minority.
Lee et al. 5
In summary, Koreans living in their country of origin con-
firm some Western stereotypes (e.g., alexithymia) and defy
other stereotypes (e.g., underappreciating the strong Korean
connection between relationship satisfaction and EI) com-
pared with Korean Americans. Thus, a recently immigrated
couple from Korea may be less traditional than a Korean
American couple. If clinicians do not take such factors into
consideration, they may make an inaccurate conceptualiza-
tion and risk damaging the therapeutic alliance.
