Abstract
Background: Mental health disorders are major contributors to the global burden of disease and their inverse
relationship with physical activity is widely accepted. However, research on the association between physical
activity and positive mental health outcomes is limited. Happiness is an example of a positive construct of mental
health that may be promoted by physical activity and could increase resilience to emotional perturbations. The aim
of this study is to use a large multi-country dataset to assess the association of happiness with physical activity
volume and its specificity to intensity and/or activity domain.
Methods: We analysed Eurobarometer 2002 data from 15 countries (n = 11,637). This comprised one question
assessing self-reported happiness on a six point scale (dichotomised: happy/unhappy) and physical activity data
collected using the IPAQ-short (i.e. walking, moderate, vigorous) and four domain specific items (i.e. domestic,
leisure, transport, vocation). Logistic regression was used to examine the association between happiness and
physical activity volume adjusted for sex, age, country, general health, relationship status, employment and
education. Analyses of intensity and domain specificity were assessed by logistic regression adjusted for the same
covariates and physical activity volume.
Results: When compared to inactive people, there was a positive dose­response association between physical activity
volume and happiness (highly active: OR = 1.52 [1.28-1.80]; sufficiently active: OR = 1.29 [1.11-1.49]; insufficiently active:
OR = 1.20 [1.03-1.39]). There were small positive associations with happiness for walking (OR = 1.02 [1.00-1.03]) and
vigorous-intensity physical activity (OR = 1.03 [1.01-1.05). Moderate-intensity physical activity was not associated with
happiness (OR = 1.01 [0.99-1.03]). The strongest domain specific associations with happiness were found for "a lot" of
domestic (OR = 1.42 [1.20-1.68]) and "some" vocational (OR = 1.33 [1.08-1.64]) physical activity. Happiness was also
associated with "a lot" of leisure physical activity (OR = 1.15 [1.02-1.30]), but there were no significant associations for
the transport domain.
Conclusions: Increasing physical activity volume was associated with higher levels of happiness. Although the
influence of physical activity intensity appeared minimal, the association with happiness was domain specific and was
strongest for "a lot" of domestic and/or "some" vocational physical activity. Future studies to establish causation are
indicated and may prompt changes in how physical activity for improving mental health is promoted.

Background
The global burden of mental and behavioural disorders is
currently estimated to account for 22.9% of years lived
with disability, which is higher than any other disease cat-
egory [1]. Previous research has predominantly focused on
preventive and curative approaches to negative mental
health disorders that are endemic in modern society [2]. It
is now widely accepted that engaging in physical activity
positively influences depression and anxiety across the
lifespan [3-6]. However, there is less evidence regarding
the relationship between physical activity and positive
mental health constructs that may subsequently increase
resilience to emotional perturbations [4,7-9]. This paucity
of research is evident in physical activity behaviour change
messages that have previously focused on disease preven-
tion rather than the promotion of positive mental health
outcomes (e.g. physical activity to prevent depression ra-
ther than to promote happiness). It is thought that exam-
ining positive components of mental well-being, such as
happiness, may identify new opportunities to apply health
promotion models to physical activity interventions and
improve mental health outcomes [10].
Despite a range of definitions for the construct of happi-
ness, there is general consensus that it comprises positive
mental or emotional (affective) states of enjoyment and
contentment [9-11]. It appears that the promotion of hap-
piness is emerging as a public health priority in several
countries globally. This is evident in a recent report pub-
lished by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Bulletin
that indicated countries such as the UK, France and
Canada are following Bhutan's example and considering
national happiness indexes to complement existing popu-
lation measures of development such as Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) [11]. This represents a clear departure
from measuring economic growth as the sole indicator of
national prosperity and has stimulated debate on how
happiness can be facilitated [12,13]. Lyubomirsky et al.
(2005) described three general predictors of happiness: (i)
life circumstances and demographics; (ii) traits and dispo-
sitions; (iii) intentional behaviours [12]. From a public
health perspective, "intentional behaviour" is the only one
of these predictors that is individually modifiable and as
an example of this, physical activity has been identified as
a strategy that may induce happiness [13].
Several literature reviews have described a positive associ-
ation between physical activity and mental well-being, but
there is a paucity of studies specific to the construct of hap-
piness [6,7,14]. The existing evidence primarily comprises
single-country cross-sectional analyses that indicate happi-
ness is positively associated with higher volumes of physical
activity [15-17]. These studies have used different methods
to assess happiness and to our knowledge there are no pre-
vious multi-country analyses that have assessed the associ-
ation with physical activity using consistent metrics. There
is also limited evidence describing the relationship of differ-
ent physical activity domains (i.e. domestic, leisure, trans-
port, vocation) and intensities (i.e. moderate, vigorous) with
happiness. This makes it difficult to target specific physical
activity promotion messages to activities that may be more
beneficial. Although previous analyses of population survey
data from several countries indicate that physical activity for
leisure appears to have a stronger association with mental
health than other domains, these studies have not assessed
the construct of happiness [18-20]. It also appears that phys-
ical activity intensity may be an important moderating factor
for various mental health outcomes, but existing recom-
mendations focus on physical outcomes and there is
currently insufficient evidence to target these towards im-
proving emotional well-being [9,21-23].
In this paper, our primary objective is to use a large
multi-country European dataset to examine the association
between self-reported physical activity and happiness. Our
secondary objective is to analyse the domain- and intensity-
specific associations of physical activity with happiness. We
intend the results to inform future research and policy on
targeting physical activity interventions to promote happi-
ness and other positive constructs of mental health.
Methods
Study sample and data collection procedures
The Eurobarometer is a multi-national survey of public
opinion and social trends in the European Union
conducted since the 1970s on behalf of the European
Commission (http://www.gesis.org/eurobarometer). In this
study, we accessed data from Eurobarometer 58.2, which
was the most recent survey that collected concurrent data
on physical activity and happiness (October 28 - December
8, 2002) [24]. The data is publicly available and its use for
non-commercial research is authorized.
Eurobarometer 58.2 was conducted among 15,334 re-
spondents from 15 European Union countries: Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, United Kingdom. All European Union citizens
residing in those countries (nationals and non-nationals)
who were at least 15 years old were eligible to partici-
pate. Sample sizes within countries ranged from n = 602
(Luxembourg) to n = 2,042 (Germany) and the overall
response rate was 54.6%.
Participants in the Eurobarometer 58.2 survey were sam-
pled via a multi-stage design. First, primary sampling units
(PSU) were selected from each European statistical adminis-
trative region in participating countries, with the sampling
probability proportional to population size and stratified by
urbanisation. Second, addresses were randomly selected
within each PSU, and then one respondent was randomly
selected per household. All necessary informed consent was
obtained for each respondent and they were interviewed

face-to-face in their homes in their national language. The
data were collected by the European Opinion Research
Group, which is a consortium of marketing and public
opinion research agencies. Further details of Eurobarometer
methods are available online (http://ec.europa.eu/public_o-
pinion/description_en.htm).
Measures
The Eurobarometer 58.2 survey categories for socio-demo-
graphic data about the participants were used for: sex (male,
female); age (15­24, 25­39, 40­54, 55 years and older);
age when finished full-time education (15 years, 16­19
years, 20 years, still studying); self-reported general state of
health (very good, good, fair, bad/very bad); employment sta-
tus (self-employed, employed, not working). We recoded the
relationship status responses into a dichotomized variable
based on current cohabitation with a partner (currently
cohabitating: "married", "remarried", "unmarried, currently
living with partner"; not currently cohabitating: "unmarried,
having never lived with a partner", "unmarried, having previ-
ously lived with a partner but on my own", "divorced", "sep-
arated" and "widowed").
The measurement of happiness was adopted from a
single question from the SF-36 survey: "In the past
month, have you felt happy?" [25]. There were six re-
sponse options that we recoded into a dichotomized
variable to differentiate between those who provided a
positive vs. negative response (YES: "all the time", "very
often", "often"; NO: "rarely", "very rarely", "never").
Physical activity was assessed by adapting questions
from the short form of the International Physical Activ-
ity Questionnaire (IPAQ-short) into a multiple-choice
format as presented in Table 1 [26]. The IPAQ-short had
test-retest reliability (Spearman's rho = 0.76) and criter-
ion validity (Spearman's rho = 0.30) that was comparable
to other self-report measures [27]. Participants were
asked to report the number of days in the past week and
the total time per day (hours/minutes) of walking,
moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activ-
ity in bouts of at least 10 minutes. We calculated phys-
ical activity volume as the sum of the three activities
with vigorous physical activity weighted by two to ac-
count for higher energy expenditure. Participants were
then classified based on the global physical activity rec-
ommendations as "inactive" (0­9 minutes of physical ac-
tivity), "insufficiently active" (10­149 min), "sufficiently
active" (150­299 min), and "very active" (300+ min). We
also calculated the independent amounts of walking,
moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activ-
ity for subsequent analysis of intensity specific associa-
tions with happiness.
The Eurobarometer 58.2 survey included four additional
questions to assess physical activity in various domains (i.e.
vocation, transport, domestic and leisure). The participants
were asked: "In the last seven days, how much physical ac-
tivity did you get: 1) at work; 2) when moving from place to
place; 3) doing work in and around your house (including
housework, gardening, general maintenance, or caring for
your family); 4) for recreation, sport and leisure-time activ-
ities?" There were three response options: "a lot", "some" or
"little or none". These data were used to assess domain spe-
cificity of the association between physical activity and
happiness.
Statistical analysis and reporting
Data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS19.0. Partici-
pants who did not have complete physical activity data
(n = 3,607) and an additional 90 individuals who reported
they were "severely restricted to physical activity" were ex-
cluded from the final analytical sample. Reported happiness
was presented according to socio-demographic character-
istics and bivariate associations were examined using a
Pearson's chi-square test. We ran logistic regressions to
examine the crude and adjusted associations of happiness
with: 1) physical activity volume; 2) physical activity inten-
sity; 3) physical activity domain. The model for physical
activity volume was adjusted for sex, age group, country,
general state of health, relationship status, employment
status and age when finished full-time education. The
model for physical activity intensity included time spent
engaging in walking, moderate-intensity and vigorous-
intensity physical activity as independent variables, adjusted
for all of the covariates described above. Since previous
studies have identified sex differences for the association

between physical activity intensity and mental health, we
tested these interactions and conducted stratified analysis
for any significant findings [21]. The associations between
domains of physical activity and happiness were tested in
separate models adjusted for physical activity volume in
addition to all covariates. The model for vocational physical
activity only included those currently employed (n = 5,816).
Statistical significance was assessed at the levels of p < 0.05,
p < 0.01 and p < 0.001.
Results
Descriptive statistics
A total of 11,637 participants with complete data from 15
European Union countries (75.9% of the original sample)
were included in the current study. Descriptive statistics on
proportion of feeling happy by country and relevant vari-
ables are presented in Table 2. Overall, 82.9% of the partici-
pants reported feeling happy (all the time, very often or
often) in the past month. Significant differences were ob-
served across socio-demographic factors and by country.
Italians (72.4%) and Germans (73.8%) reported the lowest
proportions of feeling happy and Dutch (91.1%) and Irish
(90.4%) reported the highest proportions of feeling happy.
The participants were more likely to report feeling happy if
they were male, of younger age groups (i.e. below 40 years),
in good health, currently in a relationship and working. Be-
sides a positive association between educational attainment
and feeling happy, those who were still studying were the
most likely to report being happy. There was a significant
and positive association between physical activity participa-
tion level and happiness, with nearly 86% of those who were
very active reporting feeling happy.
Physical activity and happiness
The crude and adjusted odds ratios of the association of
feeling happy with physical activity volume, intensity and
domain are presented in Table 3.
A positive dose­response relationship was found for
physical activity volume and happiness. Compared to in-
active participants, the adjusted odds of being happy was
20% higher for people insufficiently active and this in-
creased to 29% and 52% higher for those sufficiently and
very active respectively.
All crude odds ratios for the association between happi-
ness and different physical activity intensities (i.e. walking,
moderate, vigorous) were small, but statistically significant.
These associations only remained statistically significant for
walking and vigorous-intensity physical activity in the ad-
justed model. The adjusted results indicate that the odds of
being happy were 2% higher for each additional weekly
hour of walking and 3% higher for each additional hour of
vigorous physical activity. There were no significant interac-
tions with sex for our analyses of walking [p = 0.21] or
moderate intensity physical activity [p = 0.20]. However, we
found a significant interaction with sex for our vigorous
physical activity result [p = 0.002]. The sex stratified analyses
found a significant association between vigorous physical ac-
tivity and happiness for females [OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03-
1.11], but not for males [OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.98-1.03].
There was a statistically significant crude association be-
tween happiness and doing "some" or "a lot" of physical
activity in each domain (i.e. vocation, transport, domestic
and leisure). These associations remained statistically sig-
nificant for the vocational and domestic domains after
adjusting for socio-demographic variables and physical ac-
tivity volume. Domestic physical activity appeared to have
the strongest association with happiness in the adjusted
models. Compared with people who reported "little or no"
domestic physical activity, those who reported "some" had
36% higher odds of feeling happy and this further in-
creased to 42% for those who reported "a lot". In contrast,
compared with people who reported "little or no" voca-
tional physical activity, those who reported "some" had
39% higher odds of feeling happy and this decreased to
33% for those who reported "a lot". Participants who re-
ported "some" leisure physical activity were not signifi-
cantly different to those who reported "little or none", but
those doing "a lot" had 15% higher odds of feeling happy.
The amount of physical activity in the transport domain
was not significantly associated with feeling happy in the
adjusted model.
Discussion
Findings from our study indicate that increasing volumes of
physical activity are associated with higher levels of happi-
ness. The intensity of physical activity appears to be of min-
imal importance. However, the association with happiness
was domain specific and our results indicate it was stron-
gest for people who engaged in "some" vocational and/or "a
lot" of domestic physical activity.
To our knowledge, this paper presents the first multi-
country analyses of the association between physical activ-
ity and happiness. Our results for the association between
physical activity volume and happiness are similar to pre-
vious cross-sectional analyses completed in several healthy
populations. Kye et al. (2014) assessed a random sample
of 1,530 people in Korea aged 30­69 years and found that
those who exercised for 30 minutes at least five times per
week were more likely to be happy [17]. Similarly, a study
of 3,461 university students aged 17­24 years in Chile
found that those who engaged in daily physical activity
were more likely to be happy [16]. Moljord et al. (2011)
examined 1,508 adolescents aged 13­18 years in Norway
and found that those who participated more frequently in
physical activity were significantly happier [15]. Secondary
analysis of four population surveys from the USA and
Canada that included people aged 10 years and older also
demonstrated an association between physical activity and

positive mood [19]. This collection of papers suggests a
global phenomenon that extends across the lifespan and
aligns with the broader evidence for other positive con-
structs of mental health [6,7,14,28].
However, several authors remain sceptical about the asso-
ciation between physical activity and happiness. Blacklock
et al. (2007) suggested that the contribution of physical ac-
tivity to happiness might be minor compared to other
demographic and lifestyle factors such as education, income
and companionship [29]. Similarly, a longitudinal co-twin
study conducted in the Netherlands concluded that an
underlying environmental or genetic confounding factor
may be positively influencing both physical activity partici-
pation and happiness [30]. This ongoing conjecture war-
rants further prospective intervention studies to establish
the relationship between physical activity and happiness.
Our finding that only walking and vigorous-intensity
physical activity had small associations with happiness
adds to ongoing debate in the literature regarding
intensity-specificity. Although a previous review of exer-
cise and mood state suggested that moderate-intensity
physical activity is the most beneficial, it is thought that
this may vary according to the personal preference of
each individual [22]. An assessment of 6,803 Belgian
adults suggested that sex may moderate the association
between physical activity intensity and several constructs
of mental health [21]. However, our results contrasted
with the findings of this previous study, which suggested
better mental health outcomes were most strongly asso-
ciated with physical activity at a vigorous intensity for
men and at a moderate intensity or walking for women
[21]. Although it is important to note that previous re-
search has focused on broader constructs of mental
health than happiness, this ongoing uncertainty suggests
further sex specific investigation is necessary.
In contrast, we found several stronger associations be-
tween different domains of physical activity and happi-
ness. The results for the vocational domain suggest that
optimal happiness is associated with performing some
physical activity at work, but not a lot. This concurs with
existing evidence for the deleterious effects on mental
health of both highly sedentary lifestyles and work that
is primarily manual labour [31,32]. There appears to be

a "happy medium" for vocational physical activity and
further research is indicated to identify the most effect-
ive ways of facilitating this in different workplaces.
Our results for the transport domain also concur with
existing data. The Taking Part Survey included more
than 24,000 British adults and demonstrated that happi-
ness is associated with participation in recreational
sport, but not cycling for utilitarian purposes (e.g. trans-
port to work) [33]. This may be explained by concerns
about safety and the underlying recreational versus utili-
tarian motives for physical activity in the transport do-
main (i.e. commuting is often a necessary process that
"must be done" and is inherently stressful) [9,20,33].
Consequently, perhaps future research on the relation-
ship between active transport and happiness should
focus on comparisons with motorised commuting, rather
than other physical activity domains.
Contrary to our results suggesting that domestic phys-
ical activity has the strongest association with happiness,
the existing evidence indicates that the leisure domain
may be more important. Secondary analysis of the 1978
Canadian Health Survey found that women were consid-
erably happier when engaged in recreational activities
only than when domestic chores were part of their phys-
ical activity mix [19]. Our contrasting findings may re-
flect changes that have occurred between 1978 and 2002
in social perceptions of domestic activities and gender
roles and/or variation in cultural norms between Canada
and Europe. It is also likely that further changes have oc-
curred since the 2002 Eurobarometer data was collected
and this may limit the relevance of our results to current
associations between physical activity and happiness in
the participating countries. However, more recent data
from 19,842 adult participants in the 2009 Scottish
Health Survey also indicated an inverse association with
negative constructs of mental health that was stronger
for leisure than domestic physical activity [18]. Similarly,
a Belgian study of 1,919 adults demonstrated variation
according to sex and other socio-demographic factors,
but also indicated that psychological distress was associ-
ated with recreational sport participation and inversely
associated with housework [20].
We hypothesise that the strong association between hap-
piness and domestic physical activity in the 2002 Euroba-
rometer data was because the measurement tool explicitly
referred to tasks that are often recreational (i.e. gardening)
and promote self-worth (i.e. caring for family) [24]. As de-
scribed by Aszatalos (2012), these are typical characteristics
of "mindful" physical activity that is driven by a positive
underlying motivation and is more likely to be associated
with better mental health outcomes [9]. In contrast, the
domestic domains of the Canadian Health Survey focussed
on "chores", the Scottish Health Survey referred to "heavy
housework/manual and gardening work" and the previously
described Belgian study also assessed "housework" [18-20].
These descriptions invoke different connotations to the
terms used in the Eurobarometer survey and demonstrate
how the heterogeneous adaptation of physical activity mea-
sures in different settings may limit comparisons between
studies.
Methods for assessing happiness have also been subject
to ongoing debate and in 2011 there were more than
1,200 measurement items listed on the World Database of
Happiness [34]. The question we used was derived from
the widely utilised SF-36 Health Survey, but had not been
validated in isolation. Despite continued conjecture about
the use of a single-item self-report measure of happiness,
the early work of Fordyce (1977) demonstrating this to be
the most psychometrically valid approach is yet to be

refuted [35]. However, there is evidence to suggest that
the construct of happiness is inconsistent across languages
and this may have implications on the validity of the find-
ings in this multi-country study [34]. Furthermore, the
relationship with mental health outcomes may vary de-
pending on whether physical activity is measured subject-
ively (e.g. self-report) or objectively (e.g. accelerometer)
[36,37]. The limitations of self-report data for physical ac-
tivity are well documented and although this has not been
examined when assessing associations with positive con-
structs of mental health, it weakens our conclusions and
may be an important consideration in future studies.
Another limitation of our study is the cross-sectional
design. There has been limited research to establish the
existence and direction of a causal relationship between
physical activity and happiness. Wang et al. (2012) linked
data from consecutive National Population Health Surveys
in Canada and found that leisure physical activity was as-
sociated with a decreased likelihood of becoming unhappy
and may help maintain happiness over time [38]. Similar
conclusions were drawn from a survey of 438 Norwegian
adults that found that retrospectively reported adolescent
exercise levels were correlated with positive mood and
happiness in adulthood [39]. However, the relationship
between adolescent physical activity and adult happiness
was no longer significant after adjustment for adult phys-
ical activity levels [39]. Consequently, further investigation
into the direction of causation and the longitudinal
relationship between physical activity and happiness is
warranted.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time
that happiness is associated with physical activity participa-
tion across multiple countries. This study adds impetus to a
potential paradigm shift for physical activity and mental
health towards promoting positive outcomes that may be
more appealing to the population and increase resilience to
mental health disorders. However, further longitudinal re-
search is indicated to dissect the direction of causation and
the specificity of physical activity domain and intensity for
different mental health constructs.
