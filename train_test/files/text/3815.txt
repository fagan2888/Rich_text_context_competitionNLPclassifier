ABSTRACT
The ability of an AEF (axolemma-enriched fraction) to
influence the proliferation, survival and differentiation of
OPC (oligodendrocyte progenitor cells) was evaluated.
Following addition of AEF to cultured OPC, the AEF
associated with the outer surface of OPC so that sub-
sequent metabolic events were likely mediated by direct
AEF-OPC contact. Addition of AEF to the cultured OPC
resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in
proliferation that was partially dependent on Akt (protein
kinase B) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)
activation. The major mitogen in an AEF-SE (soluble 2.0 M
NaCl extract of the AEF) was identified as aFGF (acidic
fibroblast growth factor) and accounted for 50% of the
mitogenicity. The remaining 50% of the mitogenicity had
properties consistent with bFGF (basic fibroblast growth
factor) but was not unequivocally identified. Under
conditions that limit the survival of OPC in culture, AEF
treatment prolonged the survival of the OPC. Antigenic
and morphological examination of the AEF-treated OPC
indicated that the AEF treatment helped the OPC survive in
a more immature state. The potential downstream
metabolic pathways potentially activated in OPC by AEF
and the consequences of these activated pathways are
discussed. The results of these studies are consistent with
the view that direct contact of axons with OPC stimulates
their proliferation and survival while preventing their
differentiation.

INTRODUCTION
The influence of axons on oligodendrocyte development has
been controversial (Barres and Raff, 1999). While a number of
researchers have reported that axons regulate OPC (oligo-
dendrocyte progenitor cell) proliferation (Barres and Raff,
1993), the role of the axon in the differentiation of OPCs is
less clear. OPCs can differentiate into oligodendrocytes in the
absence of axons (Abney et al., 1981), giving rise to the idea
that OPCs contain an intrinsic timer related to cell divi-
sion that regulates their development. Support for this view
has previously been reported by Dugas et al. (2007) who
showed that p57(kip2) may be an intracellular timer that
regulates how many times an OPC can divide prior to
differentiating. Alternatively, a more recent analysis of the
transcriptome of OPCs reveals three enriched signalling
pathways in OPCs, which the authors postulate are influenced
by cell­cell signalling pathways (Cahoy et al., 2008). A role for

axons in preventing early differentiation of OPC via the
axonal Jagged ligand and Notch receptor on the OPC has also
been postulated (Wang et al., 1998). It is important to note
that most of these studies have utilized as an axonal source
the easily accessible optic nerve in neonatal animals.
However, in the adult CNS (central nervous system) during
demyelinating disease, it is the mature demyelinated axon
that must reinitiate the OPC proliferation and possibly
differentiation. Our laboratory has devised a method to
isolate an AEF (axolemma-enriched fraction) from the mature
CNS (Detskey et al., 1988) that retains its ability to influence
the differentiation and proliferation of myelinating glial cells
(Yoshino et al., 1984; Chen and De Vries 1989). In the present
study, we examined the potential of the axonal plasma
membrane derived from the adult CNS to influence the
proliferation, differentiation and survival of OPC. These data
are significant, since it has been reported that active
demyelinating lesions contain intact OPCs that fail to be
stimulated by mature demyelinated axons (Breij et al., 2008).
It is postulated that this lack of remyelination is possibly due
to a loss of axon­oligodendrocyte communication.
METHODS
All animals used in the present study were housed in the
Hines VA Animal Facility, and procedures were approved by
the Hines Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in
accordance with the guidelines in ``Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals'' from the National Institutes of
Health.
Preparation of AEFs
AEF isolation from bovine white matter has been previously
described (Zetusky et al., 1979; Detskey et al., 1988). In brief,
bovine CNS white matter was homogenized and centrifuged
to obtain a floating layer of myelinated axons. The myeli-
nated axons were osmotically shocked to release the myelin
from the axonal plasma membrane, followed by separation
of the shocked myelinated axons in a 10­40% continuous
sucrose gradient. To control for any variation in starting
tissue sample, multiple AEF preparations were made and
tested in multiple experiments.
Primary cell culture
OPCs were prepared from postnatal day 2 Sprague­Dawley
rat pups using the method of McCarthy and De Vellis (1986).
Cortices were dissected from approx. 25 pups, suspended in
DMEM­F12 [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium­nutrient
mixture F-12 (Ham's F12 nutrient medium); Invitrogen] and
treated for 30 min at 37°C with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen).
Trypsin digestion was inactivated by the addition of FCS
(fetal calf serum; Hyclone) and the tissue dissociated using a
14-gauge needle. Following dissociation, the cells were cen-
trifuged at 1000 g for 15 min to form a pellet that was
resuspended in DMEM­F12 with 10% (v/v) FCS. The mixed-glial
cell suspension was added to poly-L-lysine- (Sigma­Aldrich)
coated T75 flasks (Corning). The cells were allowed to attach
and the medium changed every other day. After one week in
culture, the flask contained astrocytes, OPC and some
microglial cells. The medium was changed and microglial cells
were removed by shaking at low speed on an orbital shaker
for 2 h. After removing the medium containing the microglial
cells, fresh medium was added and the flasks were shaken
overnight to selectively detach the OPC from the astrocyte bed
on which they were growing. The medium was harvested and
filtered through a nylon mesh to remove debris. Contami-
nating astrocytes were removed by plating the OPC on to
uncoated T75 flasks for 30 min at 37°C. Astrocytes preferen-
tially attach to the flask, while the OPC remain floating. The
medium containing the floating OPC was replated on to poly-
lysine-coated Petri dishes (Falcon). After OPC attachment, the
medium was changed to a defined medium containing DMEM
with Glutamax (Invitrogen 10569), 30 mg/ml gentamicin
(Invitrogen), 16ITS (insulin-transferrin-selenium; Invitrogen),
100 mM putrescine (Sigma­Aldrich), 10 ng/ml biotin (Sigma­
Aldrich) and 20 nM progesterone (Sigma­Aldrich) with 30%
B104-conditioned medium. Examination of the cultures by
phase-contrast microscopy revealed a purity of 95% or greater
of all OPC cultures used in these studies.
MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and
Akt (protein kinase B) kinase activation and
Western blot analysis
OPC were plated on to poly-L-lysine-coated 60 mm Petri
dishes with 320000 cells/plate in DMEM­F12 with 10% FCS.
After 2 h, the medium was changed to defined medium with
B104-conditioned medium. Cultures were grown for 2 days
and then were nutrient starved for 4 h prior to AEF
treatment. OPC were either treated with AEF in basal
DMEM or untreated. Cells were harvested 5, 15, 30 and 120
min following treatment. Cells were solubilized in RIPA (radio
immunoprecipitation assay) buffer with complete protease
inhibitor (Boeringer Mannheim) and 30 mg total protein was
separated using 4­20% gradient SDS/PAGE (Bio-Rad).
Following transfer to PVDF membranes, membranes were
incubated with antibodies to phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/
Tyr204) (Cell Signalling, 1:2000), Akt (Cell Signalling, 1:1000),
phospho-Akt (Ser473) (Cell Signalling, 1:1000) and G3PDH
(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Trevigen,
1:12000). Blots were washed with PBST (phosphate buffered
saline with Tween 20) and incubated with either anti-rabbit or
-mouse peroxidase-labelled secondary antibodies. Immu-
noreactive bands were detected using chemiluminescence
(PerkinElmer). Densitometric analysis was performed using UN-
SCAN-IT 5.1 software (Silk Scientific). Experiments were
repeated in triplicate using multiple preparations of AEF.

Immunocytochemistry
OPCs were plated on to poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips in
24-well plates with 30000 cells/well in DMEM 10% FCS to
facilitate cell attachment. After 2 h, the medium was changed
to defined medium with 30% B104-conditioned medium. Half
of the wells containing OPC were treated with AEF (25 mg/ml) in
basal DMEM and the other half remained untreated. At 0, 24,
48 and 72 h, coverslips were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformalde-
hyde and processed for immunocytochemistry using a
previously described protocol (Espinosa-Jeffrey et al., 2002).
Antibodies to nestin (BD Pharmingen, 1:1000), A2B5 [DSHB
(Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank)], APC/CC1 (adeno-
matous polyposis coli protein; Merck Chemicals, 1:20), O1
(DSHB), O4 (DSHB), MAP2 (Millipore, 1:1000), GalC (galacto-
sylcerebroside; Millipore, 1:2000), CNPase (29,39-cyclic nucleo-
tide 39-phosphodiesterase; Sigma, 1:50), TuJ1 (Covance, 1:500),
transferrin (Nordic Immunology, 1:50), GFAP (glial fibrillary
acidic protein; Millipore, 1:1000) and MBP (myelin basic
protein; Dako, 1:200) were used. In brief, the samples were
incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C prior to
washing and incubating with the appropriate FITC-, AMCA
(aminomethylcoumarin acetate)- or Texas Red-conjugated
secondary antibody. Negative controls were treated in the
same manner as the experimental coverslips, while omitting
the primary antibody. Select coverslips were counterstained for
nuclei with DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Analysis and
imaging were done using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with
appropriate filters equipped with an Axiocam HRm camera and
Axiovision 4.3 software (Carl Zeiss).
OPC proliferation assays
OPC were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well plates with
4000 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. OPCs were
either untreated or treated with AEF in basal DMEM for 24,
48 and 72 h. Cell proliferation following treatment was
measured using the CyQuant assay (Invitrogen) in which the
amount of proliferation is correlated with the quantity of
fluorescent dye bound to DNA within the cell. The CyQuant
assay was performed according to the manufacturer's
recommendations. In brief, cells were washed with PBS,
frozen, thawed and lysis buffer containing fluorescent dye
was added to each well. Plates were read on a PerSeptive
Biosystems (Farmingham, MA, U.S.A.) CytoFluor Series 4000
Multiwell Plate Reader (lex
at 485 nm and lem
at 530 nm) and
cell number calculated using a standard curve of fluorescence
intensity versus cell number. Statistical analysis on the mean
cell numbers for untreated and treated cultures was done
using a paired t test with significance at P,0.05.
In order to confirm results obtained with the CyQuant
assay, an MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-
tetrazolium bromide] assay was used to determine the cell
number following treatment with AEF. The MTT assay is based
on the conversion of MTT into insoluble formazan, which can
then be solubilized and the concentration determined by
attenuance (D) at 540 nm. The attenuance can be correlated
to the number of cells present in the well. OPCs were plated
at 6000 cells/well in poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well plates,
allowed to attach and treated with AEF in basal DMEM
without Phenol Red for 48 h. MEK [MAPK/ERK (extracellular-
signal-regulated kinase) kinase] inhibitor (PD-98059, Biomol)
was used at 10­50 mM and the Akt kinase inhibitor, triciribine
(Biomol) was used at 1­100 mM. Following AEF treatment, 10
ml of MTT stock solution was added to each well and
incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Following the incubation, 85 ml of
medium was removed from each well and 50 ml of DMSO was
added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37°C for
10 min. Plates were read on the PerSeptive Biosystems
CytoFluor Series 4000 Multiwell Plate Reader at 540 nm.
Attenuance values from wells with no cells were subtracted
from treatment wells to account for background signal. Mean
attenuance values from triplicate runs were expressed as a
percentage and untreated OPCs were set to 100%.
Significance of change in percent proliferation was compared
between AEF-treated and AEF-treated with addition of kinase
inhibitor using a paired t test with significance at P,0.05.
In the experiments designed to extract the mitogen from
the AEF, the more sensitive 3H-thymidine incorporation assay
was used to determine cell proliferation. In this assay, OPCs
were seeded on PDL-coated 96-well plate in defined medium
plus 1% horse serum at a cell density of 4610 cells/well. The
cells were allowed to attach for 24 h before the serum-
containing medium was removed. The cultures were washed
twice with PBS and shifted to defined medium for another
48 h. Membrane fraction or soluble mitogen in 100 ml was
added to each well for 72 h and 3 piCi/ml of 3H-thymidine
was added to the cultures 24 h after the mitogen was added.
The cultures were washed with PBS and treated with 0.25%
trypsin at 37°C for 60 min. The cells were collected on to a
filter paper using a Titertek cell harvester. The filter paper was
transferred into a 10 ml scintillation vial and 4 ml of Budget-
solve scintillation fluid (Research Products International
Corp., Mount Prospect, IL, U.S.A.) was added to each vial.
The radioactivity on the filter was determined using a
Beckman LS5801 liquid-scintillation counter.
Live-dead assay
OPCs were plated on to poly-L-lysine-coated 6-well plates
and were either untreated for control or were treated with
AEF. Following AEF incubation, the number of live (Syto10-
Green-labelled) and dead cells (Dead Red labelled) was
determined using the Live/Dead Cytotoxicity kit (Roche) in
accordance with the manufacturer' instructions. Syto 10
(green) is a permeable dye that stains the nucleic acids of all
cells and Dead Red is cell-impermeant and only labels cells
with compromised membranes. Random fields were examined
for the presence of both live and dead cells, and their
numbers recorded. Experiments were carried out in triplicate
and counts were performed by a blinded observer. Statistical
comparison of the percentage of live cells in untreated and

AEF-treated OPC was done using a paired t test with a
significance of P,0.05.
Solubilization of AEF mitogen for OPCs
Four approaches were used to solubilize the axolemmal
mitogen. Alkaline extraction: 0.25 M sodium carbonate/
sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9). Detergent extraction:
0.05% Triton X-100 prepared in 0.5 M NaCl solution. Heparin
extraction: 0.5 mg/ml heparin in water. High salt extraction: 2
M NaCl in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
AEF membranes were centrifuged in a Beckman microfuge
at 12000 rev./min (12000 g) for 10 min to obtain a pellet. The
pellet was resuspended in alkaline buffer, detergent, high-salt
solution or heparin solution to reach a final concentration of
10 mg protein/ml.
Extract mixtures were shaken at 1000 rev./min on an
orbital shaker at 37°C for 1 h and subsequently centrifuged in
a Beckman airfuge with pressure set at 28 (135000 g) for 30
min. Soluble protein in the supernatant was collected and
protein concentration was determined by the Bradford
dye-binding assay (Bradford, 1976). Insoluble pellet was
resuspended in isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl in HP) and protein
was determined with Hartree (1972) protein assay.
Before adding the alkaline extract to the culture to assay
mitogenicity, the soluble fraction of the pH 9 extraction was
neutralized with Hepes buffer; the salt and detergent in salt
extract and detergent extract were removed by dialysing the
sample in 1 litre of 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) plus
0.15 M NaCl overnight with two changes of dialysis buffer.
Dialysis tubing with a molecular mass cut-off of 3.5 kDa was
used throughout for sample dialysis. Tubing was boiled in
EDTA aqueous solutions as followed: 1.5 mM EDTA twice for
15 min each, 1 mM EDTA for 15 min and 0.2 mM EDTA for 15
min. Boiled tubing was then soaked in Milli Q H20 and stored
at 4°C. Table 1 lists the specifics of the extraction of the
mitogenic activity from the AEF.
Heat and trypsin treatment of soluble mitogen
Heat treatment
Microfuge tubes containing heparin extract in PBS, salt
extract in PBS, heparin alone or PBS alone were placed in a
water bath preheated to 60°C or 100°C for 10 min and then
cooled to room temperature (23°C). The soluble extracts were
diluted to appropriate concentration with fresh defined
medium and added to oligodendrocyte cultures.
Trypsin treatment
Heparin extract in PBS, salt extract in PBS, heparin alone or
PBS alone were treated with 0.25% acetylated trypsin (final
concentration) at 37°C for 30 min. Trypsin was inactivated by
adding 0.5% soy bean trypsin inhibitor (final concentration).
The mixture containing extract, acetylated trypsin and trypsin
inhibitor was diluted with fresh defined medium and added
to the cultures.
Heparin-sepharose column chromatography
Affi-Gel Heparin gel (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, U.S.A.) was
packed in a 0.6610 cm column and the column was equi-
librated with 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, plus 0.15 M
NaCl. Sample was applied in the same buffer at a flow rate
of 20 ml/h. The unbound fraction was collected and reapplied
to the column twice. The column was washed with the same
buffer until the D at 280 nm of the eluant reached the
background reading. Proteins bound to the column were then
eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15­2 M NaCl in phosphate
buffer. Fractions (0.8 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 12
ml/h and D at 280 nm was measured for each fraction.
Aliquots of 100 ml of each fraction were saved for protein
assay using a micro-BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay
(Smith et al., 1985). Another 100 ml of each fraction was
saved for SDS/PAGE. BSA was added to the rest of each
fraction to reach a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The
buffer of each fraction was exchanged with phosphate buffer
(20 mM, pH 7.4) plus 0.15 M NaCl by using a PD-10 column
(prepacked Sephadex G-25 column from Pharmacia). The
samples were then sterile filtered with a 0.22 pm Millex-GV4
filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, U.S.A.) and stored at 4°C.
In some experiments, the bound proteins were eluted with
step salt solution. The column was first eluted with phosphate
buffer containing 0.8 M NaCl. Fractions were collected and
D at 280 nm were measured. Fractions with D at 280 nm
above the background reading were pooled and labelled as
0.8 M NaCl fraction. Similar methods were used to collect 1.5
M NaCl fraction and 2 M NaCl fraction. The pooled fractions

were then dialysed in 0.15 M NaCl phosphate buffer (20 ml,
pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C with two changes of dialysis buffer.
The fractions were sterile filtered and stored at 4°C. Protein
concentration of each fraction was determined with the
micro-BCA protein assay.
Trichloroacetic acid precipitation of protein
Proteins in the soluble fraction were precipitated by adding ten
times the volume of 10% cold trichloroacetic acid. BSA (0.1
mg/ml as final concentration) was added as carrier when the
protein concentration in the solution was lower than 0.1
mg/ml. The mixtures were precipitated at 4°C for 2 h and
centrifuged in a Beckman microfuge at 12000 rev./min
(12000 g) for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended
with acetone and vortexed for 30 s. After removing ace-
tone by centrifugation in a Beckman microfuge at 12000 rev./
min (12000 g) for 15 min, the pellet was dried overnight under
a vacuum. The precipitate was dissolved in sample buffer for
polyacrylamide electrophoresis and subjected to SDS/PAGE.
Gel electrophoresis
SDS/PAGE was carried out using a 10% acrylamide gel by the
method of Laemmli (1970) or in an 11­23% precasted gradient
gel from Amersham (Arlington Heights, IL, U.S.A.). Ten percent
gels were run at constant current using 15 mA for the stacking
gel then 40 mA for the separating gel. Gradient gels were run
at constant current using 15 mA for the first 20 min then 40
mA until the tracking dye reached the gel front. Proteins in the
gel were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver
stained with a silver stain kit (Bio-Rad).
Immunoblot analysis
AEF, heparin extract and salt extract were subjected to SDS/PAGE
as described above and then transferred electrophoretically to
0.45 mM nitrocellulose membrane using a current of 90 mA.
Rainbow molecular mass marker from Amersham was used to
indicate the position of proteins of known molecular mass. The
filters were equilibrated in a large volume of TTBS (0.05 M Tris, pH
7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) for 10 min. BLOTTO
containing TTBS and 5% Carnation dry milk was used to block the
non-specific binding at room temperature for 10 min. Primary
antibodies at the proper dilution in BLOTTO were incubated with
the membrane at room temperature for 1 h. The nitrocellulose
filters were washed twice with large volume of TTBS for 10 min
each and blocked with BLOTTO for 10 min. Alkaline phosphatase-
conjugated secondary antibody at the appropriate dilution in
BLOTTO was incubated with the membrane at room temperature
for 1 h. The membrane was washed twice with TTBS and twice
with TBS (0.05 M Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl). The alkaline
phosphatase activity was visualized using Nitro Blue tetrazolium
(0.4 mM) and 5-bromo-4-chloro3-iodolyl phosphate (0.4 mM) in
alkaline phosphatase buffer [100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2
and 100
mM Tris/HCl (pH 9.5)]. The enzyme reaction was stopped by
washing the membrane several times with water.
RESULTS
Direct neuronal-glial contact
To determine how the isolated axonal plasma membrane
would interact and affect OPC in vitro, we directly added AEF
to wells containing actively growing OPC. We initially
observed that the AEF bound to the OPC within 30 min of
incubation (Figure 1). The OPC cultures treated with AEF did
not appear to be adversely affected with regard to
proliferation or survival, even at longer incubation times
(.72 h). We had previously determined that the AEF
contained minute fragments of neuronal cytoskeletal proteins

such as beta-3 tubulin and neurofilament, probably due to the
anchoring of these intracellular proteins to the plasma
membrane. Following incubation with AEF for 24 h, OPC were
washed to remove excess and loosely bound AEF. Using
antibodies to beta-3 tubulin and neurofilament, two proteins
not expressed by OPC, AEF was found localized to the OPC
bodies and processes (Figure 1). AEF was bound to OPC even
after incubation for 72 h (results not shown). Random binding
of the AEF to the culture dish was not detected (Figure 1B).
AEF contact induces OPC proliferation
On prolonged incubation with AEF, we noted that the number
of OPCs was significantly increased after 24 h. We incubated
increasing amounts of AEF with OPC and found a dose-
dependent increase in the amount of proliferation (Figure 2).
This dose-dependent increase in cell number diminishes with
AEF concentrations in excess of 100 mg/ml (results not shown).
The experiment was conducted using both basal DMEM with no
additives as well as defined medium without B104 (described in
the Methods) with similar results. The data shown in Figure 2
are representative of experiments performed in triplicate.
In order to determine the effect of AEF treatment over
time, we treated OPC with 10, 25 or 50 mg/ml AEF over 72 h,
measuring the amount of fluorescence and correlating
this with the number of cells at 24, 48 and 72 h. We found
a significant increase in the number of OPCs both as a
function of time and amount of AEF used for treatment
(Figure 3).
Characterization of the AEF OPC mitogen
Since the mitogenicity of AEF OPC appeared to require
membrane contact, several approaches were taken to extract
the mitogenicity from the membrane fraction.
The abilities of heparin, salt, alkaline or detergent con-
ditions to extract AEF mitogenicity are shown in Table 1.
Clearly, heparin potentiates whatever mitogen it extracts
from the AEF, since the recovery of activity was 1.6-fold
greater than the starting activity. Heparin binds and activates
aFGF (acidic fibroblast growth factor), which gave the first
clue as to the potential mitogen in the AEF. Next to heparin,
the most efficient extraction was achieved with 2 M NaCl salt
that removed about half of the original mitogenic activity
with a 5.8-fold enrichment in specific activity. Alkaline
extraction (0.25 M sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate, pH
9) solubilized 19.3% of the original protein with moderate
mitogenicity recovery (36%). Detergent (0.05% Triton X-
100+0.5 M NaCl) extracted mitogen of low specific activity
with low recovery.
Figure 4 shows a dose-dependent stimulation of OPCs 3H-
thymidine incorporation in response to added heparin
extract, salt extract, detergent extract and pH 9 extract.
Salt extract exhibited a dose-dependent stimulation curve
similar to that obtained from heparin extract, with a slightly
higher minimum effective concentration (5 mg protein/ml
for salt extract versus 2.5 mg/ml for heparin extract). Both
the pH 9 extract and the detergent extract required much
higher protein concentrations to stimulate the proliferation
of cultured OPCs. Based on these results, salt extraction was

OPCs were incubated in two types of medium, basal DMEM with gentamicin and DM, a defined medium with some growth factors
added. OPCs cultured in either DMEM or DM without AEF treatment show an increase in the mean absorbance correlating with basal
levels of proliferation. AEF treatment in addition to the medium results in an increased amount of absorbance directly correlated to
the amount of AEF added, up to 100 mg/ml when the effect has reached peak levels. Differences in the amount of converted formazan
are not significantly different between the two media used in this experiment. Data are means¡S.D. of three separate

chosen to solubilize the AEF mitogen. Since there was only
50% of the original mitogenicity present in the 2 M NaCl
extract, we confirmed that the remaining 50% mitogenic
activity is still associated with the membrane fragment.
When the mitogenicity of the salt extract pellet was
compared with the original AEF membrane, a similar dose-
dependent stimulation with 50% less potency was observed
(results not shown). We made an attempt to further
solubilize the remaining mitogenicity by a second salt
extract but failed to obtain a significant amount of activity.
The failure to extract all the mitogenicity from AEF
membrane by salt extraction is consistent with the view
that AEF might contain more than one mitogenic signal
with differing membrane affinities.

To further investigate the protective and potentiating
effects of heparin on the extracted mitogens, the heparin
extract and the salt extract (in the presence or absence of
heparin) were subjected to heat and trypsin treatments. The
results are shown in Figure 5. Note that under the untreated
conditions there was a 4-fold increase in the mitogenicity of
the salt extract. The AEF-salt extract alone was completely
inactivated by heating at 60°C for 10 min or by trypsin
digestion. In contrast, in the presence of 100 mg/ml of
heparin the mitogenic activity of salt extract was not
affected by heat or trypsin treatment, similar to the
behaviour of the heparin extract. We conclude that heparin
binds to the AEF mitogen specifically, and the formation of a
heparin­protein complex induces a conformational change of
the AEF mitogen that stabilizes the biological activity of the
mitogen.
To assess the possibility that the AEF mitogen might be
similar or identical with the brain-derived, heparin-binding
growth factors, we investigated the mitogenicity of the
aFGF and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) on cultured
OPCs under our experimental conditions. As shown in
Figure 6, both aFGF and bFGF were potent mitogens for
cultured OPCs. Purified aFGF gave a more than 50-fold
stimulation at a protein concentration of 100 ng/ml, with

half-maximal stimulation at the concentration of 8 ng/ml.
Purified bFGF stimulated the 3H-thymidine incorporation
of cultured OPCs to the same extent, with a lower half-
maximal stimulation concentration, 1.1 ng/ml. We also
examined the effect of heparin on the mitogenicity of both
aFGF and bFGF. As shown in Figure 6, 100 mg/ml of heparin
potentiated the mitogenicity of aFGF on cultured OPCs about
8-fold but had no effect on the bFGF activity. The half-
maximal stimulation concentration of aFGF in the presence
of 100 g/ml heparin was 1.1 ng/ml, similar to that obtained
for bFGF.
To determine the affinity of the AEF mitogen for heparin,
proteins in the AEF-salt extract were bound to an Affi-Gel-
heparin column and eluted using a 0.15­2.0 M salt gradient.
Figure 7 shows the elution profile of protein and the
distribution of the mitogenicity in the gradient. While most
of the proteins were eluted from the column at the salt
concentration below 0.8 M, the major peak containing
mitogenic activity was found at the salt concentration
between 1.0 and 1.5 M. The results revealed an affinity of the
AEF mitogen in the AEF-SE for the immobilized heparin
consistent with the properties of aFGF.

To definitively identify the salt-extracted mitogen, the
AEF-salt extract, the fraction eluted from Affi-Gel-heparin
with 1.5 M NaCl, and standards of purified bovine aFGF
were analysed by using SDS/PAGE (Figure 8). The proteins were
electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper and
incubated with rabbit antiserum against bovine brain aFGF or
bFGF. The anti-bFGF antibody detected 1­5 ng of bFGF but did
not detect any immunoreactivity of 10 ng aFGF. Similarly, the
anti-aFGF antibody recognized 10 ng of aFGF but did not
cross-react with 10 ng bFGF, thus confirming the specificity of
these antibodies. No band of immunoreactivity could be
detected in either AEF-salt extract or fraction eluted with 1.5
M NaCl by using anti-bFGF (results not shown). However, the
anti-aFGF antibody detected a protein in both the AEF-salt
extract and the fraction eluted by 1.5 M NaCl from the heparin
affinity column. The protein migrated to the 17.5 kDa position,
which is consistent with the migration of the FGF standards
(Figure 8). Based on the stimulation of oligodendrocyte
proliferation observed with these extracts (Figure 4), and
assuming that all that activity was due to aFGF, there should be
1­2 ng of aFGF in those two lanes, and the intensity of the
immunoreactivity is consistent with this estimation. These
results unequivocally confirm the presence of aFGF in the AEF-
salt extract.
AEF-OPC contact activates kinase pathways
The increase in the number of OPCs detected using both the
CyQuant and MTT assays could be due to both increased OPC
proliferation and/or survival after AEF treatment. To elucidate
which cellular mechanism was responsible for the increased
number of OPCs, we examined the activation of two well-
documented pathways in OPC, MAPK and Akt (protein kinase
B). Activation of the MAPK [ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-
regulated kinase 1/2)] pathway is known for its downstream
effect on cell proliferation and differentiation. Following
treatment with AEF, we found a rapid increase in the
expression of the phosphorylated form of MAPK (Figure 9A).
The peak of this increase was detected as early as 5 min after
treatment and remained at 15 min but tapered to basal levels
by 30 min. Activation of Akt and its subsequent signalling
cascade have effects on both cell survival and proliferation.
We found increased levels of phosphorylated Akt peaking
approx. 5 min following AEF incubation and with continued
activation at 15 min (Figure 9B).
OPC proliferation is MAPK dependent but Akt
independent
To gain more insight into the pathway responsible for OPC
proliferation, OPC were stimulated with AEF in the presence
or absence of inhibitors of the MAPK pathway (PD-98059) or
the Akt pathway (triciribine). The results are shown in
Figure 10. In the presence of 50 mM PD-98059, the AEF
stimulation of proliferation was inhibited significantly
(P,0.05 compared with baseline AEF proliferation). On the
other hand, AEF stimulation of OPC in the presence of 100 mM
triciribine (Akt inhibitor) had no effect on proliferation. These
data are consistent with the view that AEF-stimulated OPC
proliferation was MAPK dependent but Akt independent.
OPC survival increases following AEF treatment
Since the CyQuant and MTT assays were mainly used to assess
proliferation, we wanted to examine whether AEF treatment
played a role in cell survival via the Akt pathway. Given the
activation of both the MAPK and Akt pathways during
normal OPC culture, it was not clear as to whether the
increased number of OPCs in AEF-treated cultures was due to
an increase in cell proliferation, cell survival or both. The
percentage of live OPCs within AEF-treated cultures was
measured by counting the number of live cells within a field

and expressing this as a percentage of the total number of
cells within that field. The percentage of live cells in AEF-
treated cultures was compared with the percentage of live
cells in untreated cultures at 24-h intervals over 3 days. A
significant increase in the number of live cells in AEF-treated
cultures was observed at 24 h (Figure 11). At subsequent time
points, there was no significant increase in cell number in
the AEF-treated cultures relative to appropriate untreated
controls.
AEF-treatment reduces the extent of OPC
differentiation
Given the AEF-dependent induction of both the MAPK and
Akt pathways, the effect of AEF-treatment on early OPC
differentiation was investigated. After 24 h, the number of
AEF-treated OPC expressing nestin (an intermediate filament
protein) and A2B5 (Figure 12B, arrows), was increased
compared with untreated OPC (Figure 12A). Few AEF-treated
OPC expressed nestin alone (asterisk ­ Figure 12B), while the
majority of the AEF-treated OPC co-expressed both nestin
and A2B5 (Figures 12C and 12D). GFAP-positive processes of
astrocytes were detected in close proximity to nestin and
A2B5-positive OPC in AEF-treated but not in untreated
cultures (asterisk­Figure 12B), which may indicate that AEF-
treated immature OPC may preferentially signal to and
require close contact with astrocytes under these culture
conditions. In agreement with previous studies that showed
axolemmal fragments diminish astroglial proliferation (Sobue
and Pleasure, 1984), an increase in astrocyte proliferation
with AEF treatment was not observed (results not shown). In
untreated OPC at 24 h, there was a marked increase in the
number of OPC co-expressing CNPase and O4 which displayed
a more mature morphology with numerous branched processes
(Figure 12E). In contrast, the AEF-treated OPC expressed
limited CNPase which was restricted to the cell body. The
AEF-treated OPC did not express O4 at all (Figure 12F),
suggesting a more immature stage of maturation. After 48 h,
the untreated cultures had both increased GalC and O4-
positive OPC (Figure 12G), which exceeded the amount of GalC
expression in the AEF-treated cultures (Figure 12H). Limited
punctate GalC expression can be seen on the cell bodies and
proximal processes of AEF-treated OPC, possibly indicating the
start of maturation (Figure 12H, arrows). The emergence of
specific populations of transferrin-positive OPC in the
untreated cultures (Figure 12G, asterisks) could suggest a
second wave of differentiation occurring in these cultures.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that the majority of
the OPC in the untreated cultures have already lost immature
markers such as nestin and A2B5 and now express more
mature markers such as CNPase, O4 and GalC. In contrast, the
AEF-treated OPCs are maintained in a more immature state,
evidenced by the continued expression of nestin and A2B5, the
limited expression of CNPase, O4 and GalC, and an immature
morphology with more limited extension and branching of
processes.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have demonstrated that an AEF
isolated from adult myelinated axons stimulates the prolif-
eration, promotes the survival and arrests the differentiation
of OPCs in culture. Axonal signals responsible for regula-
tion of oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation as
well as survival are currently a topic of intense investigation.
Since the AEF can be isolated only from well-myelinated
axons, we could not generate an AEF from less mature or
actively myelinating axons for comparison of the relative
potencies of these signals during development. It is not

known if signals required for myelinogenesis in early
development would be retained by the axon later in deve-
lopment. The present study demonstrates the persistence
of axonal signals for proliferation and survival, in the
axolemma of fully myelinated mature axons. The converse
has also been reported, namely that neurites from embryonic
dorsal root ganglia can stimulate adult OPCs to divide (Wood
and Bunge, 1986). Our laboratory has also reported that
under the proper conditions adult rat OPCs can be stimulated
to divide by AEF (Vick and DeVries, 1992). Fields has recently
summarized the evidence that even in the fully matured CNS,
neuronal signals influence the thickness of the myelin sheath
(Fields, 2008). The persistence of axonal signals in mature
myelinated axons is consistent with the view that these
signals could be reactivated by neuronal activity at later
stages of development, perhaps at the paranode and at the
node of Ranvier.
Several studies have reported that the mitotic signal for
myelinating glial cells is specific to the AEF. We have previously
reported that the dose-dependent stimulation of rat OPC
proliferation by rat AEF is not present in a myelin-enriched
fraction, red blood cell membranes or a membrane fraction
prepared from astrocytes (Chen and DeVries, 1989). In addition,
neither granule cells nor a membrane fraction derived from
granule cells was mitogenic for cultured OPCs (Mason et al.,
1990). Since the neuronal mitogen for OPCs and Schwann cells
may be co-localized (Mason et al., 1990), it is relevant to cite
evidence of the specificity of AEF for Schwann cells. Plasma

membrane fractions from rat skeletal muscle or mitochondrial
fragments could not stimulate mitosis of neonatal rat Schwann
cells in culture, as reported by Sobue et al. (1983). These data
are consistent with the view that the mitogen for OPCs in AEF
is specific and not due to a generalized effect of any membrane
fraction on OPCs.
Since the AEF is a vesicular preparation, for proper cell­cell
signalling, it is critical that these vesicles are oriented with
the outside out rather than being inside out. If the vesicles
were in an outside-in orientation, this orientation would not
allow molecules that are on the surface of the axolemma in
vivo to interact with the surface of the OPCs. Three lines of
evidence indicate that the majority of the AEF vesicles are in
the outside out orientation. First, freeze fracture studies of the
AEF revealed distribution of membrane particles consis-
tent with an outside-out orientation (Cullen et al., 1981).

Secondly, AEF is able to specifically bind scorpion toxin with an
affinity similar to that of other excitable membranes (DeVries
and Lazdunski, 1981). This binding is only possible if the
membrane vesicle is properly polarized (Catterall et al., 1979),
which requires an outside-out orientation. Finally, detergent
treatment of AEF does not increase the specific activity of the
externally orientated acetylcholinesterase, implying that none
of this enzyme, which is externally orientated and enriched in
the preparation (DeVries et al., 1983), is trapped inside the
membrane vesicles, i.e. the AEF vesicles have an orientation
that is outside out (G.H. DeVries, unpublished work). Therefore,
the AEF preparation has an orientation that allows the surface
of the axolemmal vesicles to interact with the outer surface of
the OPCs, mimicking the cell­cell contact in vivo.
Although evidence has been presented to indicate that
axonal signals for proliferation of OPC are secreted by axons
(Richardson et al., 1988), there are abundant data to suggest
that the mitogenic signal for OPCs is membrane bound. No
mitogenic activity can be detected in the supernatant of
high-speed centrifugation of the AEF (G.H. DeVries, unpub-
lished work). Wood and Bunge (1986) first reported that in
culture, only OPCs that had contacted neurites were
stimulated to divide, which our laboratory has also confirmed
(Mason et al., 1990). In further support of the tight
association of the AEF mitogen with the membrane, we have
previously reported that the AEF-related mitogenic signal for
Schwann cells and OPCs are both tightly membrane bound
(Mason et al., 1990).
A membrane-bound mitogenic signal implies that the mi-
togenic effect of AEF is mediated by direct contact of the
AEF with the cultured OPCs. Given the similarity of the AEF
mitogen for both Schwann cells and OPCs (Mason et al.,
1990), studies that support direct contact of the AEF with the
surface of the Schwann cell are informative. For example,
fluorescent labelled AEF quickly localizes to the outer sur-
face of Schwann cells and eletron microscopy studies confirm
this cell surface localization. Direct contact of AEF with
Schwann cells is also supported by the observation that, in
contrast to myelin, AEF does not require internalization and
lysosomal processing for its mitogenic activity (Meador-
Woodruff et al., 1985). AEF specifically binds with high
affinity to the surface of Schwann cells, but it does not bind
at all to fibroblasts, consistent with AEF-Schwann cell surface
binding. Treating the AEF with trypsin or heat inactivation
decreased mitogenicity and adhesion to cultured Schwann
cells in a parallel fashion, further supporting the cell surface
localization of the AEF mitogen (Sobue and Pleasure, 1985).
The extraction of the AEF mitogen by heparin (Table 1)
indicates that the AEF mitogen is bound to a heparin-like
molecule that is displaceable by heparin. Therefore it is likely
that at least some of the mitogenicity in AEF is bound to cell
surface heparin-related molecules and in this manner is
presented to the oligodendrocyte surface as a result of cell­cell
contact.
For the first time we report that at least half of the
mitogenicity in the AEF for OPCs is due to aFGF. A number of
lines of evidence support this view. The properties of the AEF
mitogen are identical with those of aFGF: it is extracted
by 1.5 M NaCl (Table 1), it is displaceable from the AEF by
heparin (Table 1), it is potentiated and protected by heparin
(Figure 5), and its elution profile from a heparin affinity
column (Figure 7) is consistent with the elution profile of
aFGF from a heparin affinity column (Thomas et al., 1991).
Finally, PAGE analysis of the peak of mitogenic activity eluted
from the heparin affinity column and the 1.5 M extracted
mitogen unequivocally identify the mitogen as aFGF. A
quantitative analysis of the mitogenicity in the salt extract
leads to the conclusion that aFGF, is the only mitogen present
in that fraction. For example, the mitogenicity for OPCs in a 5
mg/ml heparin-stimulated AEF-SE (soluble 2.0 M NaCl extract
of the AEF) is equivalent to 5 ng/ml of heparin-stimulated
aFGF. PAGE analysis of AEF-SE (Figure 8) revealed that there
is 1 ng of aFGF/mg of AEF-SE. Therefore, the 5 mg/ml AEF-SE
contains 5 ng of aFGF, which can account for the total
mitogenicity in the AEF-SE. If OPCs respond not only to aFGF
but also to other growth factors in the AEF-SE, a proliferation
greater than can be accounted for by the aFGF in the AEF-SE
should be observed that is not seen in our experiments. We
conclude that the major mitogen extracted by 2 M salt from
the AEF is aFGF.
However, the AEF-SE represents only 50% of the total
mitogenicity in the total AEF fraction (Table 1), raising the
interesting possibility that the AEF could contain other
mitogenic signals in addition to aFGF. Preliminary results
indicate that like the AEF-SE, the salt-extracted AEF pellet
was able to stimulate the proliferation of FGF-sensitive
cultured fibroblasts and cultured OPCs, suggesting that the
non-dissociable AEF mitogen might be similar to the salt
dissociable mitogen (S.-J. Chen and G.H. DeVries, unpublished
work). The best candidate for this tightly associated mitogen
is bFGF, because bFGF has been localized in neurons and
because bFGF usually associates much more tightly with a
heparin or heparin-like molecule than aFGF (Gospodarowicz
et al., 1984; Lobb and Fett, 1984; Lobb et al., 1986). PAGE
analysis of AEF has confirmed that bFGF is present in the
preparation (S.G. Becker-Catania and G.H. DeVries, unpub-
lished work). However, given that there are high levels of
bFGF in astrocytes (Gonzalez et al., 1995), we cannot exclude
the possibility that if bFGF is in the preparation, it may be
derived from bFGF released from astrocytes during prepara-
tion of the AEF. Further investigations will be required to
clarify this matter, since the tightly bound mitogen has not
yet been identified.
The identification of aFGF and potentially bFGF as axonal
mitogens for OPCs is consistent with the localization of these
factors in the CNS. We have previously reported that cultured
dorsal root ganglion neurons express both aFGF and bFGF on
the surface of neurites after 20 days in culture (Neuberger
and DeVries, 1993a). Both these growth factors were present
on the surface of neuritic vesicles after a crush injury to
neurites that had been cultured for 30 days (Neuberger and
DeVries, 1993b). Elde et al. (1991) reported that in the CNS

aFGF was localized in neurons and not glial cells, with
strong aFGF immunoreactivity in the axonal membrane of
myelinated axons. Since the AEF is derived from myelinated
axons, it is not unreasonable to find aFGF in the AEF. In
addition, Butt and Berry (2000) proposed that FGF is an
axonal signal that regulates myelination based on in vivo
studies of the effect of FGF on myelination in the rat anterior
medullary vellum. We conclude that the presence of aFGF in
AEF is consistent with its distribution in the CNS and reflects
the in vivo expression of aFGF associated with the axonal
plasma membrane in myelinated axons.
However, other molecules associated with the AEF may also
contribute to the observed effects of AEF on OPCs. For
example, it is known that both BDNF (brain-derived
neurotrophic factor) and basic FGF induce oligodendrocyte
proliferation (McTigue et al., 1998; Mason and Goldman,
2002) and AEF also contains BDNF and bFGF (S.G. Becker-
Catania and G.H. DeVries, unpublished work). NRG (neuregulin)
I isoforms have also been reported to play a major role
in signalling that affects oligodendrocyte specification,
differentiation, myelination and survival, at least in vitro
(Raabe et al., 1997; Flores et al., 2000). Since both the alpha
and beta isoforms of NRG I Type II have been detected in AEF
(J.K. Fitzgerald and G.H. DeVries, unpublished work), it is
reasonable to propose that these NRG I isoforms may stimu-
late the MAPK and Akt pathways. It is interesting to note that
NRG I (III) is completely absent from CNS axons and AEF (Bare
et al., 2011). Therefore, it is not likely that this isoform of
NRG I plays any role in the biological effects of AEF on OPC
although NRG I (III) is a critical axonal initiation factor for PNS
(peripheral nervous system) myelination (Taveggia et al., 2005)
and modulates CNS myelination (Taveggia et al., 2008). In any
case, it is clear that activation of MAPK (ERK, specifically p42
and p44) is required for AEF-stimulated OPC proliferation to
occur (Figure 9).
In addition to MAPK and Akt, AEF is also likely to influence
other downstream signalling pathways related to prolifera-
tion. For example, CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding
protein) has been reported to be a major mediator of the
MAPK pathway regulating OPC proliferation (Johnson et al.,
2000). AEF has been shown to induce both the expression and
phosphorylation of CREB (Lee et al., 1996, 2003). Therefore it
is possible that AEF-stimulated proliferation of OPC may
result from the induction and phosphorylation of CREB and
subsequent activation of MAPK in the OPC.
The metabolic pathways in OPCs which are activated by
AEF are consistent with pathways known to be activated
by FGF. For example, FGF activates both the Akt and the
MAPK pathways (Yim et al., 2001). FGF activation of the Akt
pathway prevents apoptosis in the OPCs lineage (Yasuda
et al., 1995), which is consistent with the protective effect of
AEF on oligodendrocyte survival possibly mediated by the AEF-
associated FGF (Figure 11). Evidence has also been presented to
suggest that FGF plays a subtle role in oligodendrocyte
maintenance in the mature CNS (Harari et al., 1997). It is
possible that in the mature CNS, AEF-associated FGF may play
this role. Butt and Berry (2000) reported that in vivo FGF
retarded oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. The
inhibitory effect of aFGF and bFGF on OPC differentiation in
vitro has also been reported (Engele and Bohn, 1992). Further
studies showed that the inhibitory effect of FGF on
oligodendrocyte differentiation was mediated by a specific
FGF receptor known to be present on OPCs (Zhou et al., 2006).
These data raise the possibility that AEF-associated FGF could
mediate the inhibition of OPC differentiation that we observed
(Figure 12). In summary, many of the biological effects
observed when AEF contacts OPCs may be due to the FGF
found in the AEF.
The ability of AEF to prevent OPC differentiation is
interesting and unexpected. Although it would seem logical
that OPC­AEF contact would stimulate myelinogenesis,
recent evidence suggests several explanations for this
inhibitory effect. The Gallo laboratory recently reported that
ERK activation in OPC up-regulated c-Jun, which in turn has
a negative effect on myelin gene expression (Chew et al.,
2010). Therefore the sequence of events after addition of AEF
to OPC could include rapid activation of ERK leading to
stimulation of c-Jun, inhibition of myelin gene expression,
and repression of other myelin markers as noted in Figure 12.
Subsequent activation of p38 MAPK would repress ERK and
JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activity and via up-regulation
of Sox 10 stimulate the expression of myelin markers (Chew
et al., 2010). These data would imply that signals other than
those found in the AEF will be necessary to stimulate
myelinogenesis after axonal contact is re-established follow-
ing demyelination. The Notch1 signalling pathway in OPC is
another FGF-activated pathway known to inhibit OPC
differentiation (Zhang et al., 2009). In OPC, downstream
targets in the Notch signalling pathway such as mastermind-
like 1 and Hes 5 were activated by FGF signalling and
inhibited OPC differentiation (Zhou and Armstrong, 2007).
Taken together these data raise an interesting possible
inhibitory role for the axolemma after demyelination.
Evidence has been presented that after demyelination, the
Notch signalling pathway is specifically activated in OPCs
near demyelinated lesions (John et al., 2002). The high
expression of a ligand that activates the Notch1 signalling
pathway (Jagged 1) was noted in hypertrophic astrocytes
and postulated to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation via
secretion of Jagged 1 by astrocytes, subsequent activation
of the Notch pathway, followed by inhibition of OPC
differentiation. After demyelination, contact of OPC with
the surface of demyelinated axons containing FGF could
activate these downstream effectors in the Notch signalling
pathway and further inhibit OPC differentiation. In any
case, the pathways activated by FGF and the downstream
effects of this activation are consistent with the localiza-
tion of FGF on the axonal surface of mature myelinated
axons.
After demyelination, rapid OPC ensheathment can promote
axonal preservation that is required not only during
development but also after demyelination when the axon is

in a metastable condition (Franklin and Kotter, 2008;
Kassmann and Nave, 2008). Therefore, it is advantageous
for the demyelinated axon to rapidly signal to the appropriate
myelinating cell, expediting rapid myelin ensheathment. In
this regard, we have shown that within 5 min after addition
of AEF to OPC, both the MAPK and Akt activation are almost
at maximal levels (Figure 10). We have also reported a similar
rapid induction of axonal signals to Schwann cells (Saunders
and DeVries, 1988). It has been reported that maximal AEF-
induced Schwann cell proliferation requires 24 h of exposure
to AEF in spite of the fact that maximal AEF adhesion to
Schwann cells is reached after 6 h (Sobue and Pleasure, 1985).
Although initial axonal contact may cause a rapid metabolic
response in both Schwann cells and OPC, sustained axonal
contact is required to achieve a proliferative response. AEF
binding to OPC persists even after 72 h in culture (see
Figure 12). We have previously reported that AEF signalling to
induce CREB expression reaches a maximum at 72 h (Lee
et al., 1996). These data suggest that the OPCs are not able to
phagocytose or break the binding between the AEF
membrane fraction and the OPC cell surface for at least
72 h (Meador-Woodruff et al., 1985). This persistent AEF-OPC
binding suggests that if OPC are supplied to a freshly
demyelinated axon, then after binding, the OPC would rapidly
receive the appropriate signals to survive and multiply, but
further signals may be required for differentiation. A possible
candidate for the differentiation signal is LIF (leukaemia
inhibitory factor), which the laboratory of Fields has
identified as a key signalling molecule for the initiation of
myelination (Ishibashi et al., 2006, 2009). Recently, evidence
has been presented that LIF-negative mice have impaired
remyelination implying a role for LIF in remyelination
(Marriott et al., 2008).
In summary, the present study demonstrates that axonal
signalling to OPC leading to proliferation and survival as well
as arrested differentiation can result from direct axonal
contact with the OPC. aFGF has been identified as a key
factor in the AEF preparation relating to mitotic stimulation
of OPCs by AEF. These results are consistent with the report of
Butt and Berry (2000) who concluded that axons and OPC
form interdependent functional units and that axons govern
the number of OPCs and their differentiation state. Current
studies are aimed at further identification of factors in the
AEF that also contribute to regulation of OPCs.
