Introduction
This article poses a very simple question: What are the main
concerns raised by climate change sceptics?1 This is an impor-
tant question for multiple reasons. First, it is a question that has
been neglected in studies of scepticism and sceptics. Scholarly
and popular attention has centered on the cultural, ideological,
material, and psychological contexts of the sceptical phenom-
enon. Second, the core views of sceptics, particularly the prom-
inent publicists, filter through to the public.Those in the general
public who are receptive would be inclined, one might assume,
to appropriate these arguments of the sceptic elites. In addition,
thirdly, if one wished to counter or neutralize the sceptical argu-
ments, a thorough understanding is necessary of the types of
objections raised by sceptics to both the substance and conduct
of mainstream climate science.
Taking notice of sceptics' express objections to the sub-
stance and conduct of mainstream climate science would
address one of the most enduring criticisms that sceptics
have continued to level against mainstream exponents,
namely that mainstream exponents are uncritically foreclos-
ing debate, and in the process become guilty of the exact
same thing they are accusing the sceptics of, namely, protect-
ing their vested interests, group-think, and pushing an ideo-
logical agenda.
Critical exposure of the machinations and sociopsycho-
logical biases of certain sceptics can be helpful,2 yet we
argue that progress in the climate debate will be better
advanced through open discussion and testing of arguments
in the public sphere. Progress will not be achieved by avoid-
ing direct engagement with the specific claims of sceptics.
Instead, we envision a long, hard-fought victory in which the
scientific evidence debate should occupy the foreground. We
propose that not all sceptics are of the entrenched/obstinate
kind, and that many sceptics sincerely share the values of
transparency, critical freedom, and inclusivity associated
with serious scientific enquiry.
The article elaborates this argument by first describing the
prevailing depictions of climate change scepticism in the
scholarly literature, followed by a consideration of the dif-
ferential influences of scepticism at lay and elite levels. We
then outline the specific (Australian) context of the sceptic
views that will be canvassed, followed by a brief explanation
of how we have used the textual analysis tool, Leximancer,
to unpack some key texts. The main sceptical objections are
mapped and cataloged, followed by a discussion of their sig-
nificance and structure. The article concludes with some
remarks about a way forward in dealing with climate change
scepticism.

Climate Change Scepticism:
Reconsidering How to Respond to Core
Criticisms of Climate Science and Policy
Willem Van Rensburg1 and Brian W. Head1
Abstract
The contextual drivers of climate change scepticism are well described and explained in the literature. A key assumption
underlying most of the scholarly constructions of the sceptical phenomenon is that the key objections raised by sceptics to
climate science and climate policy proposals represent some form of submerged deception or self-delusion on their part.
This article refocuses attention on sceptics' central criticisms, and argues that direct responses to these criticisms should not
be neglected in favor of a primary focus on sceptics' possible inner motivations. The article investigates the core objections
raised by sceptics, with particular attention to the views of one prominent Australian sceptic, Andrew Bolt. We argue that
some of these objections should be treated as legitimate forms of dissent, and that ongoing constructive responses to such
criticisms are necessary to counter the impact of climate change scepticism.

The Scholarly Construction of "Climate
Change Scepticism"
A recurring theme in scholarly explanations of climate
change scepticism is that when sceptics think about the cli-
mate problem, they are heavily influenced by prior com-
mitments (Rudiak-Gould, 2014). Scholars claim that
sceptics' opposition to mainstream climate science and cli-
mate mitigation policies is, in fact, a smokescreen for
deeper values and consequent disputes about social and
economic processes and policies (Dunlap, 2013, p. 695).
Climate change scholarship argues that governments need
to steer their economies away from heavy reliance on fos-
sil fuels, entailing a major transition with costly adjust-
ments. As such, the role of government, the role of the free
market in determining the allocation of resources, and the
prevailing consumerist culture in general have come under
question. In short, the prevailing status quo is challenged
by science-driven plans to reduce society's reliance on
industrial technologies that emit large concentrations of
greenhouse gas (GHG), and it is this threat, scholars and
observers insist, that sceptics are really targeting through
their challenging of mainstream climate science (Boussalis
& Coan, 2013, p. 3). The climate issues trigger, it is argued,
a defensive reaction from political conservatives (McCright
& Dunlap, 2000, 2003, 2010).
The worldview/ideological roots of climate change
scepticism have been explored in the work of, among oth-
ers, Peter Jacques, McCright and Dunlap, and Clive
Hamilton. For Jacques, climate change scepticism is a spe-
cies within the broader genus of "environmental scepti-
cism," and stems from a deep anthropocentrism among
ideological conservatives (Jacques, 2006). In his view,
environmental scepticism "guards against paradigmatic
changes to world dominant social values and institutions
that guide global accumulation and concentration of power"
(Jacques, 2006, p. 78). In essence, climate change scepti-
cism is a defense of economic modernity. McCright and
Dunlap propose a similar thesis, describing climate change
scepticism as one of the strategies deployed by conserva-
tives to counter or undermine environmental "moderniza-
tion" and associated policy reforms (McCright & Dunlap,
2010, p. 101). Similarly, Hamilton describes climate change
scepticism as central to conservatives' persistent efforts to
block the policy strategies of "environmentalism," which
they see as a major threat to Western notions of prosperity
(Hamilton, 2010, pp. 101-114).
The idea that climate change has become a battleground
for conflicting worldviews is also argued by some politi-
cal anthropologists. The school of Cultural Theory associ-
ated with the work of Douglas, Wildavsky, and Thompson
proposes that individuals, when faced with a challenge,
tend to favor solutions and strategies consistent with the
"worldview" associated with their "cultural type" (Verweij
et al., 2006, pp. 818-821). The Cultural Theory "type"
most associated with climate change scepticism is the
"individualist," who according to Thompson favors "indi-
vidual pursuit of rational self-interest" and "the optimal
allocation of resources" through free markets (Thompson,
2003, p. 227). Many of the policy solutions proposed to
counter climate change might require major regulatory
interventions to reduce GHG-intensive production, but
such policy transformations would run counter to the indi-
vidualist preference for free markets and limited govern-
ment. As noted by Verweij and colleagues, individualists
would tend to discount both the scientific basis of climate
mitigation policies and the merits of response policies. By
contrast, the individualists would tend to favor perspec-
tives, consistent with their worldview, that nature is resil-
ient and that human innovation and entrepreneurship offer
the best prospect for addressing environmental challenges
(Verweij et al., 2006, p. 827).
Other scholars have drawn on cognitive psychology for
identifying distinct cognitive processes that might contribute
to an individual's stance on the climate issue. Mechanisms
such as cognitive dissonance avoidance and assimilation bias
have been found to distort the interpretive powers of the indi-
vidual (Anderegg, 2010; Bell, 1994; Boykoff & Smith, 2010;
Leiserowitz, 2005; Marshall, 2011; Poortinga, Spence,
Whitmarsh, Capstick, & Pidgeon, 2011; Swim et al., 2010;
Whitmarsh, Seyfang, & O'Neill, 2011). These mechanisms
explain the significance of ideological, cultural, and other
social predispositional influences. Avoidance of cognitive
dissonance is the main cognitive-psychological process iden-
tified by scholars as helping to explain sceptics' resistance to
the evidence of human-induced climate change. According
to Upham et al. (2009), individuals tend to notice and inte-
grate information supporting their existing cognitive sche-
mas, while ignoring or rejecting inconsistent information. If
a conflict arises, people will "typically act to reduce the cog-
nitive dissonance by changing their attitude to justify their
behaviour, claiming (or perceiving) to have little or no choice
in their action, or denying any inconsistency" (Upham et al.,
2009, p. 14).
Scholars have also noted other cognitive heuristics or
shortcuts, which might facilitate individual biases and
misjudgments. Nisbett and Ross (1980) have cataloged
diverse ways in which humans err in their judgments,
many of which have been applied to explaining climate
beliefs. The role of social groups and peer influence have
been widely documented as shaping people's responses to
risks and issues (Kasperson et al., 1988, p. 185).
Individuals are inclined to, belong to, and remain loyal to
"affinity groups central to their personal wellbeing"
(Kahan, 2013, pp. 417-418).
A sharply critical interpretation of climate change scepti-
cism has drawn on the notion that such views are potentially
pathological.According to this view, sceptics, especially those
Van Rensburg and Head 3
engaging in public debate, display some of the behaviors con-
sistent with the "paranoid style"--a term used by Richard
Hofstadter (1964) to describe the irrational behavior of extrem-
ist fringe elements. According to this claim, sceptics may
exhibit the paranoid personality's sense of disconnection and
alienation from the mainstream, and defensively attribute
blame to specific enemies. Sceptics are, in the paranoid style,
both irrational and extreme in their views. The theme of scep-
tic irrationalism is often used by champions of climate science
(e.g., Hoegh-Guldberg, 2013). A related accusation is that
sceptics indulge in conspiracy theories. Some scholars have
pointed to impact of the sceptics' suspicions that "green
extremists" and "self-serving scientists" are manipulating the
climate debate (Bricker, 2013, p. 220); such conspiracy theo-
ries may influence public opinion about the integrity and
strength of mainstream climate claims (Diethelm & McKee,
2009, pp. 2-3).
The above constructions of climate change scepticism
facilitate two interpretations of the phenomenon. A "hard"
and critical interpretation holds that climate change scepti-
cism is a contrived and ideological phenomenon. Sceptics
deliberately manufacture heightened doubts about the core
claims of mainstream climate science, as part of a strident
defense of the status quo. This critique is reflected in the
titles of numerous accounts of the activities of climate
change sceptics and their political and financial backers
(see Dunlap & McCright, 2011; Gelbspan, 1997, 1998,
2004; Hamilton, 2007, 2010; Hodder, 2010; Hoggan, 2009;
Leggett, 2001; Oreskes & Conway, 2010; Pearse, 2007;
Pooley, 2010). A "softer" interpretation of the phenome-
non is that the worldviews are acting indirectly, as back-
ground dispositions that are reinforced by various cognitive
and psycho-sociological mechanisms noted previously
(e.g., Anderegg, 2010; Boykoff & Smith, 2010; Whitmarsh
et al., 2011). In this "softer" interpretation, the cognitive-
psychological drivers amount to dispositional influences
on individual behavior, somewhat like "invisible hands"
that guide the debate (Kahan & Braman, 2006, p. 155).
Interestingly, the "hard" interpretation is most frequently
applied to "elite" sceptics, whose leaders are often accused
of cynical bad faith, whereas the "softer" or indirect inter-
pretation is reserved for "lay" sceptics, who are seen as
more naïve and less capable of negotiating the complexi-
ties of climate change knowledge. It is to this dichotomy
that we will turn next.
Elite/Lay Distinctions
Survey research has demonstrated some commonalities
among lay sceptics in terms of their cultural and value
dispositions. Surveys in Australia (Tranter, 2011, 2014),
the United States (Borick & Rabe, 2010; Dunlap, Xiao, &
McCright, 2001), Canada (Heath & Gifford, 2006), and
the United Kingdom (Poortinga et al., 2011; Whitmarsh,
2011) showed strong associations between several clus-
ters of ideas: conservatism, support for the free market,
anthropocentricism, low concern about climate change,
high scepticism about climate science, and opposition to
climate change mitigation policies. Surveys that focus on
political party identification established the same pattern.
An Australian survey showed that, even under circum-
stances of wide public concern about the climate during
2007, political party identifications were strongly corre-
lated with climate change beliefs. Labor and Green sup-
porters were almost 3 times as likely as conservative party
supporters to believe that global warming would pose a
serious threat in their own lifetime (Tranter, 2011, p. 89).
Surveys in later years reaffirmed the partisan divide on the
climate issue (Tranter, 2013, 2014). A major study of
Australian public opinion on the climate issue (Reser,
Bradley, Glendon, Ellul, & Callaghan, 2012) found that
87.9% of Green supporters and 73.6% of Labor supporters
indicated concerns about climate change, whereas only
half the conservative supporters felt the same.
The links between climate scepticism and political con-
servatism are also evident at the level of political elites.
For example, conservative think tanks in the United States
have produced most of the "environmental sceptical" com-
mentaries (Jacques, Dunlap, & Freeman, 2008; Union of
Concerned Scientists, 2016), and have strongly influenced
the content of the printed media (Dunlap, 2009). A similar
trend was found in Australia, where conservative front
groups and think tanks have played leading roles in the
climate-sceptic campaigns (Hodder, 2010; McKewon,
2012), buttressed by the role of the conservative Murdoch
media outlets in promoting climate-sceptic positions
(Bacon, 2011; McKnight, 2010). Leaders of conservative
parties in the United States and Australia have also been
more sceptical of the climate risks than their center-left
and progressive counterparts (Dunlap & McCright, 2008;
Fielding, Head, Laffan, Western, & Hoegh-Guldberg,
2012). Fielding et al. (2012, p. 712) found that in Australia,
"political ideology (left­right) emerged as the most impor-
tant predictor of politicians' climate change beliefs." They
found that
politicians from more left-leaning or politically progressive
parties (Greens, Labor) had beliefs that more closely endorse
scientists'beliefs about the causes and impacts of climate change
and gave greater priority to climate change in their political
work. In contrast, conservative politicians were more uncertain
and more sceptical about climate change and gave lower priority
to climate change. (Fielding et al., 2012, p. 728)
Tranter (2013) found the same pattern: strong majorities
of Green and Labor politicians believed (in a 2010 poll) that
"global warming will pose a serious threat to your way of life
in your lifetime," in contrast to only a third of conservative
4 SAGE Open
politicians (pp. 405-406). Interestingly, both Fielding et al.
(2012, p. 728) and Tranter (2013, p. 412) found that on cli-
mate issues the politicians were even more polarized along
ideological lines than the voting public.
The similarity of correlations between personal biases
and climate opinions at lay and elite levels, however, can
obscure important differences in how scepticism is main-
tained at these two levels. It is reasonable to suspect that
laypersons are more passive in both forming and maintain-
ing their climate views, by comparison with elite actors
who would be more active in assessing information and
reviewing and revising their opinions. Marshall (2009)
pointed out that "having neither the time nor skills to
weigh up each piece of evidence" the lay person "fall(s)
back on decision-making shortcuts formed by our educa-
tion, politics and class."
Elites or intellectuals who actively tackle these issues in
some depth might be assumed to engage in careful analysis
and assessment, rather than simply produce ideological
conclusions. We argue that many (though not all) sceptics
could be expected to consider their arguments carefully, to
be self-aware about their own biases, and argue within
"normal" levels of intellectual integrity (Van Rensburg &
Head, 2017). Sceptics often claim that their queries and
counterarguments are scientifically grounded, and that that
they could change their positions if more conclusive evi-
dence, in their estimation, emerged that could dispel their
doubts and concerns.
As a background to analyzing one selection of texts in
some depth, we first describe the political context of the
period in which the views were expressed.
Time Period
Australia has been a hotbed of debate over climate change
policy and climate scepticism for a long time. Contestation
over the climate issue reached a peak during the period of a
Labor national government from 2010 to 2013. Labor intro-
duced a new carbon-pricing scheme (Department of the
Environment, 2011) as a result of policy negotiations to
secure the formation of a minority government after the 2010
election (Crowley, 2013). Labor gained the support of the
Greens for the introduction of carbon pricing, despite sub-
stantial business opposition (Christoff, 2013). Public opinion
polls in 2011-2012 demonstrated declining support for car-
bon pricing and lower levels of public concern about the
need for decisive climate action (Lowy, 2012, pp. 6-7). The
conservative opposition, the Liberal-National coalition, was
determined to "scrap the carbon tax." In September 2013, the
conservatives won the election and they abolished the car-
bon-pricing scheme in mid-2014.
In the following year, the climate issue subsided as an
electoral and legislative issue. It did resurface at intervals
in the context of two prominent international events--the
G20 summit in Brisbane in November 2014, whose com-
munique included reference to climate policy, and the
relatively successful Conference of the Parties (COP) to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris in November­December,
2015. But in general, the period from August 2014 to
December 2015 in Australia represented a much less
heated period in terms of climate policy debates. In other
words, it was not complicated by election politics or leg-
islative posturing. Politicians themselves made few forays
into the issue, leaving public commentary largely to indi-
viduals (sceptics and nonsceptics) who had an enduring
interest in the issue.
The issue remained important, despite it subsiding in pub-
lic prominence. A major survey on the climate change opin-
ions among Australians found that a substantial proportion of
the Australian public (38.6%) did not believe humans were
responsible for observed climate changes. A small group
(7.9%) denied that the climate is changing at all. Combined,
these two groups of climate change sceptics outnumbered
the people who believe both that the climate is changing and
that humans are largely responsible (Leviston, Greenhill, &
Walker, 2015).
Sample Composition and Text Analysis
Sole-authored opinion pieces by Andrew Bolt--a prolific
and well-known Australian climate change sceptic, journal-
ist, newspaper columnist, radio commentator, blogger, and
television host--were collected from the Factiva Database
for the period August 1, 2014, to December 2, 2015. A total
of 17 unique articles were found in which the words "climate
change" or "global warming" occurred either in the title or in
the lead paragraph. The list of these 17 items is provided in
the appendix. Bolt is regarded as a significant opinion leader
for the lay sceptics in Australia. His work mobilizes a range
of claims linked to science, political ideology, economic
growth, and global competition.
The data set was subjected to a computerized text analysis
to highlight the most significant words and concepts. The
proprietary text processing software Leximancer was used
for this purpose. Leximancer exploits the quantifiable char-
acteristics of a text corpus. Quantifying the semantics of text
has the advantage of grounded research, namely, that the data
drive the explanation of the phenomenon and potential
researcher bias is minimized. Leximancer is specifically
designed to "learn(s) in a grounded fashion what the main
concepts in a corpus are and how they relate to each other"
(McKenna & Rooney, 2005, p. 6).
Leximancer produces a concept map that provides a
visual illustration of the main concepts in the text sample and
their connectedness. Proximity on the map indicates that
concepts appear in similar textual contexts, and vice versa.
When concepts appear in polarized positions, it is indicative
Van Rensburg and Head 5
of weak relationships and mutually exclusive contexts,
which usually occurs when the author offers multiple dis-
tinct, relatively freestanding arguments. The concepts in the
center of the map are well connected to most other concepts
and are either important grammatical terms (which can be set
aside), or point to themes that are important to all (or most)
of the distinct arguments in the text.
Findings
Figure 1 shows the concept map of the text sample after
being processed by the Leximancer software. The central
area of the concept map is encircled by the dotted oval. These
concepts are well connected to most other concepts on the
map, hence their central location. Some concepts in this area
simply reflect the topic of the text as predetermined by the
search strategy. The terms "Australia," "emissions," and
"carbon" would naturally be prominent and central to the
views of an Australian about climate change or global warm-
ing. Some other concepts in the central area serve generic
grammatical purposes, such as "told," "don't," "leader,"
"week," and "year," and would have low value for under-
standing argumentative themes.
Remaining in the central area, then, are six concepts (two
groups) that potentially add meaning to the general argumen-
tative thrust of the text sample. Table 1 shows their relative
frequency of use in the sample.
Concept Group 1 consists of the terms "fact," "tell,"
"truth," and "scare." Following are summaries of the contex-
tual use of these four terms:

Discussion
The concept "scare" is the most prominent "connecting"
concept in the text sample. In other words, it is used in mul-
tiple argumentative contexts and can be considered a recur-
ring theme in the text. It is used to indicate that a mind-set
prevails in important government, scientific, and public sec-
tors that climate change is something to be feared. Sceptics
perceive this mind-set as a distortive influence on the public
and that there is a need for a more "realistic" picture of the
phenomenon. Sceptics are also convinced that some individ-
uals and institutions exploit this mind-set to artificially main-
tain momentum behind the call for urgent and comprehensive
climate change action.
Sceptics' perception of climate change as a massive unwar-
ranted "scare" is primarily underpinned by arguments repre-
sented in the "fact," "tell," and "truth" concepts.These concepts
are all related to the notion that the mainstream position lacks
rigor in one respect or the other. The "fact" concept links to
perceived inconsistencies in the scientific evidence (e.g., the
claimed hiatus in land surface and warming), the logic of cli-
mate change measures (e.g., Australian emission cuts would
represent only a miniscule proportion of what is needed glob-
ally to contain climate change), and the logic in supportive
arguments (e.g., containing climate change will not resolve or
prevent indirectly related problems such as human conflicts
over increasingly scarce natural resources). The "tell" concept
equally links to a perceived lack of rigor in the mainstream
position. Here the sceptical perception is that mainstream expo-
nents regularly withhold important contextual information
(e.g., not disclosing the full costs of emission cuts), and that
they do not openly acknowledge uncertainties or contradictory
scientific evidence. The "truth" concept also conveys the scep-
tic notion that mainstream exponents present an incomplete
picture of the scientific evidence (e.g., that some coral islands
might in fact be growing instead of shrinking).
The concept "greens" adds two quite different argumenta-
tive themes. First, it contains the notion that those supporting
the climate change "scare" are doing so for the motive of
leading the world to a radically alternative socioeconomic
order. Sceptics suspect such an ideological agenda on the
part of the far left (who they see as antagonistic to the polit-
ico-economic status quo and as seeking ambitious social and
economic transformation), and that center-left parties such as
the Labor Party are complicit, albeit somewhat naïvely, in
this agenda. A second theme emanating from the "greens"
concept is a perception that the political left is willing to sup-
port disproportional sacrifices and costs on their own host
country (Australia in this case) to combat climate change
(e.g., that Australia should not only abandon the coal indus-
try but also forego the benefits of fracking, nuclear power, or
new hydro-electric dams, while other nations such as the
United States and China maintain a wide range of options).
The "stop" concept is related to the concepts in Concept
Group 1, which argue that the portrayal of climate science is
8 SAGE Open
not entirely truthful or realistic. The sceptic argument here is
that the mitigation measures endorsed by mainstream cli-
mate science would not "stop" the global warming that sci-
entists so alarmingly predict. More realistically, the sceptic
argument continues, efforts to "stop" climate change consti-
tute a futile exercise against an unproven risk.
The concepts in Concept Group 1 ("fact," "tell," and
"truth") overwhelmingly construct the sceptic notion that the
mainstream climate position lacks rigor and is overblown, in
comparison with the concepts in Concept Group 2 ("greens"
and "stop"). The "green" concept is the only concept that
introduces new argumentative lines (i.e., Bolt's specter of
world government and the claim that Greens and the left
undermine local economic well-being).
Thus, the sceptical position as revealed in the text samples
investigated here shows that sceptics emphasize a perceived
lack of rigor in the mainstream position in relation to the
scientific evidence behind climate change, as well as the
logic and outcomes of climate mitigation measures. The
main argumentative lines are built around perceived con-
flicts in the evidence and partial or exaggerated presentation
of the "facts." These sceptic text samples seem to center their
criticism on the substance of mainstream exponents' claims,
with criticism of the motivations of left wing players as an
interesting but secondary source of concern for sceptics.
This is a significant finding for those concerned with
communicating the mainstream view and those policy prac-
titioners who need to devise climate measures that would
enjoy public support. It means that climate sceptical beliefs
are potentially vulnerable to convincing arguments built
around the scientific evidence and the need and benefits of
mitigation measures. More importantly, it shows that climate
sceptical criticisms are often built around a small number of
examples of perceived inconsistences and exaggerations. It
would not be necessary to "convince" sceptics of every
aspect of the science and every aspect of the case for early
and effective climate intervention. The sceptical position can
be met by persistently responding to a relatively small num-
ber of specific criticisms (Van Rensburg & Head, 2017).
Understanding the political and sociopsychological driv-
ers of scepticism can be helpful in devising sophisticated
communication strategies that might appeal to sceptical
audiences. However, the sceptic discourse as outlined here,
demonstrates that it is equally important to engage sceptics'
substantive criticisms and concerns. Sceptics rely on per-
ceived inconsistencies and improbabilities in the evidentiary
claims of mainstream opponents to justify their continued
criticisms. From a sceptical point of view, the mainstream
position will continue to lack credibility as long as these per-
ceived inconsistencies and improbabilities have not been
tackled head-on by mainstream protagonists. In fact, sceptics
interpret the lack of attention to their concerns as proof of
what they perceive as scientific fiefdoms, closed circuit
thinking, and professional and political manipulation of the
climate issue.
Conclusion
We argue that examining the specific objections of sceptics is
important for devising more effective responses. We argue
that climate communicators and practitioners should con-
structively, patiently, and persistently respond to sceptical
criticisms, instead of trying to starve sceptics of public expo-
sure by refusing to engage them. Ranalli (2012) cautioned
against probing the underlying intentions of sceptics, sug-
gesting that a more open-minded approach might open up
"opportunities for improved understanding" (p. 202). The
argument for greater openness and public debate rests on a
positive conception of the public (including the sceptic ele-
ments) as relatively intelligent and scientifically capable
(Tøsse, 2013, p. 35). Such an approach favors engagement
with sceptics over disengagement. This aligns with scholarly
work indicating the importance of "social robustness" in sci-
entific deliberations (Gibbons, 1994).
In practical terms, we recommend climate communicators
and policy practitioners adopt five axioms for dealing with
the sceptic challenge:
Accept Debate
Mainstream exponents of climate science and policy should
use every opportunity to convincingly put their case. It is a
fallacy to believe that the sceptic challenge could be neutral-
ized by denying it public attention. Given the complexity,
uncertainties, and vast array of climate-related scientific fields,
sceptics have many stories about anomalous or contradictory
evidence. Only by consistently winning the evidence-informed
debate can the science experts ensure the public is turned away
from cynical scepticism. Mainstream climate exponents can
avoid much suspicion and derision from sceptic quarters, if
they are willing to engage with the sceptic arguments.
Anticipate and Preempt Debate
Climate science and policy communications tend to empha-
size the affirmative case. This may assist the sceptics in their
claim that key uncertainties are underplayed. If climate com-
munications included responses to anticipated critiques (such
as constructing answers to Frequently Asked Questions), it
would create a stronger impression of even-handedness. It
would also help communicators to prepare themselves for
the inevitable challenges and debates.
Acknowledge the Uncertainties in the Science and
the Risks in the Policies
Transparency is an essential quality of good science. The uncer-
tainties in climate science occur in the context of strong agree-
ment about the core trends, causality, and impacts. Avoiding
public engagement with sceptics has allowed them to elevate
some scientific uncertainties to undeserved prominence, and
Van Rensburg and Head 9
maintain that the science is not settled. Similarly, in regard to
policy tools such as carbon pricing, communicators need not be
overly defensive about such measures, as the case for carbon
pricing is strong. By acknowledging potential risks from poor
design, communicators have the opportunity to explain how
those risks can be managed.
Correct Any Overstatements
Climate science typically presents its assessments in terms of
probabilities. When the worst scenarios are dramatically
highlighted, sceptics can claim this represents premature
scare-mongering. Science communicators should carefully
qualify their claims, and demonstrate how policy measures
are proportionate to the challenges faced. In rare cases where
mainstream exponents misrepresent the scientific evidence,
communicators should enhance the legitimacy of science by
publicly correcting misrepresentations.
Maintain a Respectful Tone
Complaints by both sides about the acrimonious tone of
some exchanges need to be taken seriously. The label "cli-
mate denier," to name just one example, evokes deep resent-
ment among sceptics and merely distracts the debate from
the science issues. It is the derogatory opposite of "climate
alarmist." Sceptics range from the entrenched ideologists to
the seriously uncertain. It is the last group who would be
most responsive to patient and respectful engagement.

Notes
1. The terms "scepticism" and "sceptics" are widely used to
denote those unconvinced about the core claims of the main-
stream climate science thesis, namely, that human activities
have significantly affected the global climate owing to higher
levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), leading to
such impacts as sea level rise, higher temperatures, severe
weather events, ocean acidification, and so on. This form
of scepticism is different from the general norms and prac-
tices of scientific scepticism--that is scholars undertaking
close scrutiny and critical review of each other's research
(Van Rensburg, 2015). The label climate change "sceptic"
is widely used in media discourse and academic analysis,
and several prominent writers happily describe themselves
as climate change "sceptics" (Painter, 2013; Painter & Ashe,
2012). However, there is significant variation among sceptics
in terms of the grounds for their scepticism and the degrees
of conviction with which they hold their views (Dunlap,
2013, p. 693). They constitute a distinct category, because
they remain unconvinced of core scientific claims that are
extremely well established and about which high levels of
certainty exist (Painter, 2013, p. 15). In that sense, they
have been described as scientific "outliers" (Boykoff, 2013;
Boykoff & Olson, 2013, p. 278).
2. The website skepticalscience.com goes to great lengths to
expose and debunk so-called sceptical myths. It has been at the
center of investigations into the level of "consensus" among
climate-related scholars about the climate issue. It also has a
free online e-learning resource aimed at educating people in
the origins and biases of "climate science denial."
