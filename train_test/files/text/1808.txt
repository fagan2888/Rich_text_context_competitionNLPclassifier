Abstract
Objective: The study compared the height and BMI values of US children and youth by gender in the
most recent NHANES surveys (1999­2004) to those of their Dutch counterparts in 1997 in order to
gain insights into the different growth patterns.
Results: US children and youth are both shorter and heavier than their Dutch counterparts. US
adolescent girls tend to experience an earlier growth spurt than do the Dutch and the velocity of
growth of US boys slows down faster after the adolescent growth spurt than does that of their Dutch
counterparts. The latter end up being approximately 5.6 cm taller and their median BMI values are
1.9­2.0 less than that of US youth between the ages of 10 and 19. This implies that US boys of the
same height at age 19 are 8.8 kg heavier than their Dutch counterparts, and girls of age 13 are 7.2 kg
heavier.
Discussion: Some studies link high BMI values in childhood to an earlier onset of adolescence, which in
turn has been linked to less growth thereafter.
Conclusion: The fast tempo of growth of the US children may be associated with high energy balance,
which leads to higher BMI values and which in turn may be associated with less growth during
adolescence.

Introduction
Americans were the tallest in the world until the cohorts born around the time of World
War II when they were overtaken first by the Dutch and then by most other Western and
Northern European populations as Americans experienced two decades of practical
stagnation in adult height among the birth cohorts of circa 1955­1975 (Komlos and Baur
2004; Komlos and Lauderdale 2007). A similar stagnation was found among children

(Malina 1990, p. 211; Freedman et al. 2000; Komlos and Breitfelder 2007). Thereafter
some growth has taken place (1976­1983), but not sufficient to catch up to West European
levels. Today the Dutch are the tallest population in the world (Burgmeijer and van
Wieringen 1998; Van Wieringen 1986; Fredriks 2004). We compare the linear growth
profiles and BMI values of Dutch children in 1997 to those of US-born (non-Hispanic)
black and white children measured in 1999­2004 in order to gain some insights into the
differences in anthropometric values of the two populations.
We confine our comparisons to children born in the USA, because the inclusion of
immigrants, Asians, and Hispanics would impart a degree of heterogeneity to the height
sample that would make the comparison to their Dutch counterparts less appropriate
(Rosenbaum 2005). It takes generations for immigrants to reach American height levels
(Smith et al. 2003). For example, Mexican-Americans in the NHANES 1999­2002 sample
aged 20­29 were 8.5 cm shorter than Non-Hispanic white Americans (McDowell et al.
2005, p. 26). Furthermore, immigrants were also excluded from the Dutch sample. In the
Netherlands, boys of Turkish origin at age 14 were 10.9 cm shorter than their Dutch
counterparts, and similarly Moroccan children were 8.5 cm shorter (Fredriks 2004, pp. 113,
133). (Both Turkish and Moroccan children were either first or second generation
immigrants.) Differences in BMI values by ethnicity, however, are less blatant. Among
males, for example, the BMI values of non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Mexican-Americans
are almost the same among 20­39-year-olds (McDowell et al. 2005, p. 27).
The US and Dutch data sets are comparable insofar as both are representative of the
respective domestic-born population. The Dutch sample pertains to those who had Dutch
parents (both) or if not, at least one parent had to be Dutch and the other could be West
European. Insofar as we have excluded from the US sample those who were not born in the
US as well as Hispanics and Asians, the two samples are comparable. The weights given in
the sample were used to calculate all US statistics.
Methods
Using the three most recent (biennial) surveys referred to jointly as NHANES 1999­2004
we calculate the weighted averages of US children's height by age stratified by gender.
The data are available from the Center of Disease Control (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes.htm). The weights, provided by the center, are designed to render the sample
representative of the US population. Because of the relatively small number of observations
in some cells, we smooth the obtained result with a non-linear regression model using
BayesX, a `freeware' program (Lang and Sunder 2003). BayesX enables us to smooth
adjacent values of the coefficients using polynomial splines for non-linear effects. The values
of the function provide the smoothed values of the height by age profile calculated from the
raw data (Table I, column A). Furthermore, we reproduce Dutch reference values (1997) to
which the US children are compared (Fredriks et al. 2000b) (Table I, columns B, F). The
Dutch data used for this comparison were kindly provided by Stef van Buuren of the
Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research and are the same as those
published in Fredriks et al. (2000). The US data are averages over the year for a particular
age while Dutch data pertain to the mid-year values estimated using the LMS method
(Cole 1990). The Dutch BMI values and weights are also compared to current US values
(Table I, columns G, H).

Results
While US babies are longer at birth than their Dutch counterparts, the latter catch up by age
6 months and are continuously taller thereafter. At age 2þ the mean height of US boys
(1999­2004) is at about the 25th percentile of the Dutch reference values until about age 10
when they increase across the centiles but are again near the 25th percentile by age 17 and
thereafter (Figure 1). At age 2þ US girls are at a somewhat higher Dutch percentile value

determined by the inclusion of blacks. The curves have not been smoothed for whites
otherwise the `all girls' and `white girls' lines would be hardly distinguishable.
Growth velocities are not accurately estimated in cross-sectional samples, but insofar as
both the US and Dutch samples are cross-sectional the biases should be similar and
therefore one might gain some insights by the comparison (Figures 4 and 5). Among girls
the Dutch and US growth increment curves would be very similar provided the Dutch values
were lagged by 1 year, except that among US girls the adolescent growth spurt is somewhat
more concentrated around the peak growth increment between ages 9.5 and 10.5. Among
Dutch girls the average growth increments are slightly smaller between the ages of 8 and 10,
implying that there are fewer precocious girls in the sample than among US girls, but there
are more girls in the Dutch sample who experience their peak growth later, at age 12 and
therefore increase the average values (Figure 4). Because of the 1 year's worth of longer
growth prior to adolescence the adult height of Dutch females is nearly 6 cm above that of
their US counterparts (Figures 2 and 3).
The growth increment curves are quite similar among US and Dutch boys except that
there are few more precocious boys at ages 10.5­11.5 in the former. The greatest
growth increments are at similar ages 12.5­14.5 in both samples (Figure 5). However, the
decrease in the growth increments is steeper among US boys between ages 15 and 17,
indicating either that growth in late adolescence decelerated more rapidly or that a larger
number of Dutch boys experience more growth in late adolescence than US boys. This
difference in growth at ages 16­20 accounts for nearly half of the difference in adult height.
The whites-only curves are not depicted in Figures 4 and 5 because the values coincide with
the `all' US graphs.
Median Dutch BMI values (1997) are consistently below US values 1999­2004 and
substantially so after age 8 (Table I, column G and Figure 6). The maximum difference of
2.8 BMI units is reached among 19-year-old boys and 13-year-old girls. This translates into

a difference in weight of some 8.8 kg for boys and 7.2 kg for girls at the mean US height at
those ages (Figure 7). The average difference in weight at ages 13­20 at the mean US heights
is 6.5 kg among boys and 5.0 kg among girls. The US reference values are based on data
from 1963 to 1980 (except for 2­6-year-olds, for whom data from 1988 to 1994 are also
included). They are not depicted here, but they are above the Dutch values particularly after
age 9. The average difference between US reference values and the Dutch BMI values is 1.4
among boys and 1.1 among girls between the ages of 11 and 20 even though the Dutch
values have increased since the previous survey in 1980.
Discussion
Reference charts are useful insofar as they describe what is `normal' within the population in
the sense of being most frequently observed. In contrast, the Dutch reference charts are
useful for other populations from the perspective of being an example of `ideal' development
conducive to a healthier life (Waaler 1984; Cole 2002). From that perspective Dutch
reference values provide a complementary perspective on the height, BMI values, and
development of US children and youth without arguing that the Dutch reference values
are representative for the US population. This is a similar perspective to that of the
World Health Organization insofar as it uses reference values of height for six healthy,
well-nourished populations as an `ideal standard' against which the world's children should
be evaluated (Kuczmarski et al. 2000).
It is noteworthy in this regard that the CDC also constructed weight and BMI reference
charts in terms of an `ideal normal' and not as a normal in the sense of being most frequently
observed. It states: `. . . all charts with weight and BMI exclude data from NHANES III for
children ages 6 years and older. This exclusion was made because of the higher prevalence of
overweight in this sample as compared with data from previous surveys. NHANES III had
an unduly high influence on the curves compared with the other surveys' (Ogden et al. 2002;
Ogden et al. 2004). In other words, the CDC did not use the recent values for weight
because these values did not reflect outcomes obtained in a `best practice' environment,
i.e. included values which reflect the current obesity epidemic and would give a biased view
of healthy development. Arguably the use of Dutch reference values for height and BMI
values has similar implications. Moreover, the use of Dutch height references gives US
parents an opportunity to gauge their children's growth relative to a `world standard' in
a similar fashion as the World Health Organization uses reference values from six countries
as an ideal standard for the world population (Garza and de Onis 2004). The Dutch are the
tallest in the world today with a relatively low level of obesity and it should be useful for
parents to know how their children compare not only to the rest of their US peers, but also
to the world's best practice.
There are several obvious differences in the height and weight of US (1999­2004) and
Dutch (1997) children and adolescents: (a) US children are shorter than Dutch children
throughout their growth years although they are born longer. (b) More US girls experience
the onset of their adolescent growth spurt at an earlier age than Dutch girls: the latter lag the
former by about a year, but Dutch girls grow for a longer period of time during adolescence.
The rate of growth of Dutch girls exceeds that of their US counterparts between the ages of
11 and 16. At age 11 years US girls are within 1 cm of their Dutch counterparts and boys are
within 2 cm but fall behind thereafter (Figure 3). (c) The cross-sectional growth increments
are quite similar between US and Dutch boys until reaching the peak adolescent growth
spurt, but thereafter the velocity of growth decelerates at a faster pace among US boys.
Are Americans shorter (partly) because they are fatter? 601
(d) As a consequence of these growth patterns both male and female Dutch are more than
5 cm taller by age 20 than US adults. (e) US children are consistently heavier, but
particularly so after age 8. The average difference among adolescents is some 5.0­6.5 kg.
US nationwide longitudinal studies do not exist on the growth velocities to corroborate
the cross-sectional ones depicted above, but scattered regional evidence does tend to do so.
In a longitudinal sample of six US cities average age of girls at peak growth velocity was 11.5
among whites and 10.8 among blacks, that is to say, slightly later than one might infer from
the cross-sectional evidence above. Among boys in that same sample it was 13.6 among
whites and 13.3 among blacks (Berkey et al. 1994, p. 439), that is to say, within the range of
cross-sectional estimates presented here. In contrast, among the Dutch adolescents the
mean age at the (longitudinal) peak height velocity was 12.6 years among girls and 14.0 years
among boys, that is to say later than among their US counterparts (Kemper et al. 1985).
Admittedly, the Kemper et al. study pertains to a small sample and begins at age 12þ so that
it may not have captured the growth spurt of early maturers. While it is not strong
collaborative evidence of the above-described pattern, it is the only one available and hence
worth mention to the extent that it at least does not contradict the cross-sectional growth
increments calculated above. Hence, both cross-sectional and longitudinal samples tend to
indicate that the tempo of growth is greater in early adolescence among the US population
than among the Dutch.
The obesity epidemic in the US is clearly linked to the high energy balance of the
population caused by the over-consumption of food coupled with the sedentary lifestyle,
which leads to extraordinary BMI values particularly after age 8 (Figures 6 and 7). Insofar as
dietary intake, particularly of animal protein, can affect the onset of adolescence (Berkey
et al. 2000), the high pre-puberty calorie intake in the US may well induce an earlier onset of
the adolescent growth spurt among females in the US. In turn, the early onset of the
adolescent growth spurt may affect adult size: `several studies have clearly illustrated the
negative impact of early puberty on final height' (Vizmanos et al. 2001, Karlberg 2002, p. 22,
Hermanussen et al. 2006, Sandhu et al. 2006). He and Karlberg (2001) argue that `A higher
BMI gain in childhood was related to an earlier onset of puberty' and a `reduced height gain
in adolescence . . .' although adult height was not affected in their Swedish sample. Nutrition
is one of the factors associated with the onset of puberty along with genetic and hormonal
ones: `puberty results from the awakening of a complex neuroendocrine machinery in which
the primary mechanism is still unclear . . . the molecular determinants are yet to be identified'
(Parent et al. 2003). `The pace of pubertal development correlates with the levels of sex
steroid hormones during early puberty' (Rogol et al. 2002, p. 196). Overnutrition prior to
adolescence may affect the hormonal system and may produce too much growth hormone
prior to puberty so that sex steroids are produced earlier (Karlberg 2002, p. 27). In a
personal communication Rogol suggests that estradiol levels might well play a key role in the
US growth pattern: `The critical path is that these small but biologically relevant levels of
estradiol begin to increase GH release and IGF-I levels and lead to the initiation of the
pubertal growth spurt which occurs at a younger age in girls than boys and perhaps more
importantly at an earlier stage of puberty in girls. For boys the issue is the same ­ it is
estradiol that leads to the increase in GH and the pubertal growth spurt.' Indeed, the
positive correlation between estradiol levels and peak growth velocity has been documented:
`The estrogen level is closely related to testosterone concentration and to the time of peak
growth velocity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that estrogen at low
levels augments skeletal growth and maturation . . . They are also consistent with the
hypothesis that continued exposure to estrogen leads to epiphyseal fusion' (Klein et al. 1996;
Janfaza et al. 2006).

The overload of carbohydrates and fats in a fast-food diet may also be inimical to
the consumption of micronutrients essential to growth. While the evidence is admittedly
circumstantial, the possibility arises that the high US BMI values may contribute to
the higher tempo of growth of the US population and also to the shorter adult heights.
While such findings have not been consistently reported (Koziel 2001) this could depend on
the degree of obesity in the population as there are possible trigger or threshold effects.
There are other indications that adolescence begins earlier in the US. Generally girls
with higher BMI values also experience earlier menarche (Juul et al. 2006, p. 252).
The age at menarche in the US in the early 1990s was 12.9 years among whites and 12.2
years among blacks while in the Netherlands it is 13.2 years and in Denmark 13.4 years
(Fredriks et al. 2000). Breast development was also significantly earlier in the USA than in
European countries, including the Netherlands (Juul et al. 2006, p. 251). The timing
of sexual maturation among American boys is also earlier than among Europeans
(Juul et al. 2006, p. 252). This set of evidence also indicates that adolescence is reached
earlier in the USA than in the Netherlands.
Conclusions
US children and youth are both shorter and heavier than their Dutch counterparts
(Figures 3 and 6). US adolescent girls tend to experience an earlier growth spurt than do the
Dutch and the velocity of growth of US boys slows down faster after the adolescent growth
spurt than does that of their Dutch counterparts (Figures 4 and 5). In turn the latter end up
being 5.6 cm taller and their median BMI values are 1.9­2.0 less than that of US youth
between the ages of 10 and 19 (Figure 6). This implies that US boys of the same height at
age 19 are 8.8 kg heavier than their Dutch counterparts and girls of age 13 are 7.2 kg heavier
(Table I and Figure 7).
Research on the relationship between BMI and earlier onset of puberty on other
populations suggests that the somewhat speculative hypothesis might well be worthwhile to
consider, namely that such effects are at work in the US as well. In other words, in addition
to the US medical system and dietary habits which would affect height directly (Komlos and
Lauderdale 2007), the positive energy balance itself might also lead to a higher tempo of
growth in childhood and an earlier cessation of growth in adolescence. Thus, there might
well be a causal association between the high BMI values in the USA and the relatively
shorter stature of the Americans.
We conjecture that US children would be capable of reaching Dutch reference values in
both height and BMI values. It is true that the US population is socially more heterogeneous
­ i.e. has more poverty ­ than the Dutch society, which also leads to inadequate medical care
as well as sub-standard diets which contribute to the height­weight differences of US and
Dutch children and youth (Komlos and Lauderdale 2007). Yet, that Americans could gauge
themselves by Dutch standards is supported by the fact that Americans were 6.5 cm taller
than the Dutch in the middle of the 19th century (Komlos and Baur 2004). Moreover, the
World Health Organization believes that at least in early childhood `nearly all interethnic
variability is probably a result of environment assaults' (Garza and de Onis 2004). Hence,
we suggest that Dutch reference values should complement the ones currently in use for
US-born non-Hispanic, non-Asian children in order to gauge ideal height and weight in an
international context (Figures 1, 2, 8 and 9).
Cole and Roede (1999) have advocated the use of 1980 Dutch BMI reference values as
a `suitable baseline to monitor international trends in obesity.' These were below the 1997

values used here (Fredriks et al. 2000). Moreover, Dutch BMI values are by no means
atypical. They are similar to Danish ones (Juul et al. 2006). US BMI reference values
(not shown here) are above those of the Dutch and are probably not appropriate to gauge
healthy development.
Children's biological welfare is clearly important. As a recent UNICEF (2007) report
states, `The true measure of a nation's standing is how well it attends to its children ­ their
health and safety, their material security, their education and socialization, and their sense of
being loved, valued, and included in the families and societies into which they are born.'
According to an index of well-being calculated by UNICEF on the basis of 40 variables
Dutch children came out on top followed by the Swedes and Danes (UNICEF 2007).
Furthermore, the US was near the bottom of the list of 21 countries examined. That the US
has almost twice the rate of infant mortality and has the lowest life expectancy compared to
Western European countries are other indications that health of US children is below that of
Western European levels (WHO 2007). A recent report found that `compared with five
other nations . . . the US ranks last or next-to-last on five dimensions of a high performance
health system: quality, access, efficiency, equity, and healthy lives' (Davis et al. 2007). These
biological outcomes correlate with the evidence on heights and weights. Thus, more
attention needs to be paid to these anthropometric markers insofar as they reflect health in
general and conditions in childhood and youth have a long reach into adulthood.
