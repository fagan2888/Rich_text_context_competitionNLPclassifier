Introduction
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are among the most complex
health problems of the 21st century (Ungan & Yaman, 2003).
It affects all body systems as well as the mental health and
social relationships of carriers and asymptomatic patients
(Tavossi, Zaferani, Enzevaei, & Tajik, 2004). HIV/AIDS is
transmitted through sexual transmission, parenteral, perina-
tal transmission, and contaminated blood products (Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and World Health
Organization [UNAIDS/WHO], 2006).
As of 2009, it is estimated that there are 33.3 million peo-
ple worldwide infected with HIV (Worldwide AIDS & HIV
Statistics, 2009). Although HIV/AIDs prevalence rates in the
Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) are low, the region
has one of the fastest-growing HIV infection rates in the
world (United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS,
2007). Djibouti and Sudan have the highest prevalence rates
in the Arab world and are facing a generalized epidemic
(WHO, 2006). As of January 5, 2011, the prevalence rate of
AIDs among Saudi adults 15 to 49 years was 0.04%, with
10,000 people with AIDs and 300 deaths (UNAIDS/WHO,
2008). The route of infection in the Arab world is unpro-
tected heterosexual intercourse. However, in some countries,
injecting drugs is the major cause of HIVinfection (Badahdah
& Sayem, 2010).

Abstract
This study aimed to assess acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception
among Saudi nursing students, and to identify predictors of their willingness to provide care for patients with AIDS. A cross-
sectional study of 260 baccalaureate nursing students at King Saud bin-Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, was done using a previously validated instrument. Students' knowledge percentage mean score (PMS) on AIDS was
72.93 ± 10.67 reflecting an average level of knowledge. There were many misconceptions about how AIDS is transmitted,
for example, use of same toilets and bathrooms and washing clothes together (24.9%), swimming (53.7%), and coughing and
sneezing (49.6%). Nursing students reported an overall negative attitude toward AIDS, with a PMS of 43.48 ± 9.21. The
majority of students agreed that AIDS patients should be isolated from other patients (83%), and should not share the room
with other noninfected patients (81.8%), and some reported that people living with AIDS deserve what has happened to
them (24.7%). After controlling for confounders, students' poor knowledge and negative attitude were associated only with
having never been given nursing education as their primary university education "Stream 2 students" (p = .012 and p = .01,
respectively). These findings have implications for development of teaching strategies and curricular approaches for nursing
to address this health care issue.

Health education and prevention remain the main health
care priorities in HIV/AIDS prevention, because of HIV/
AIDS is still a noncurable disease and developing an AIDS
vaccine has proven extremely complex due to virus's ability
to mutate (Buskin, Lin, Houyuan, Tianii, & Mcgough, 2002;
Pita-frenandez, Rodriguez, & Pertega, 2004; Preston, Forti,
& Kassab, 2002; Watkins & Gray, 2006). Studies were con-
ducted in Turkey (2003) and Saudi Arabia (2005) revealed
that health education intervention has a positive impact on
students' knowledge and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS
(Al-Mazrou, Abouzeid, & Al-Jeffri, 2005). Several studies
revealed the importance of health education to reduce stigma
related to HIV/AIDS (Earl & Penney, 2003; Martin &
Bedimo, 2000). Another study in Nigeria (2005) showed that
although students were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS,
many do not practice what they know (Ogbuji, 2005). Study
in Iran (2004) showed that there were misconceptions about
the route of transmission such as Mosquito bites 33%, public
swimming pools (21%). and public toilets (20%). It also con-
cluded that although the knowledge level seems to be moder-
ately high, there was intolerant attitude toward HIV/AIDS
patients (Tavossi et al., 2004).
Nursing students are being identified as a potential risk
group for the HIV/AIDS infection, for that reason awareness
regarding HIV/AIDS in this group is very important for its
prevention (Rondahal, Innala, & Carlsson, 2003). Literature
indicated the lack of accurate information about HIV infec-
tion is associated with lack of confidence in caring for clients
with HIV/AIDS patients. Researches indicated that nursing
students are frightened of AIDS patients and often unwilling
to care for them (Petro-Nustas, Kulwicki, & Zumout, 2002).
Nursing attitudes toward HIV/AIDS patients will heavily
influence their willingness to learn about and provide health
care for this population (Lohrmann, Valimaki, Suominen,
Muinonen, & Dassan, 2000; O'Sullivan, Preston, & Forti,
2000). Unwakwe (2000) reported that students with suffi-
cient education and more knowledge about HIV/AIDS had
more positive attitudes and were more willing to provide
care for HIV/AIDS patients.
In countries such as Saudi Arabia, for which Islam is the
official religion, compliance to Islamic rules is thought to
offer the best protection for Muslims from AIDS. Traditional
Muslim approaches have tended to be conservative, and it is
difficult to break the silence around issues of sexual behav-
iors, especially those that deviate from religious norms
(Ersilia, 2002). Yet, the most recent estimate of the number
of people living with HIV/AIDS in the Middle East and
North Africa is about half a million (Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization
UNAIDS/WHO, 2008). Nursing plays major role in the care
for HIV/AIDS patients. Therefore, it is very important to
assess the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of this group.
This will provide a basis for a much-needed AIDS education
for the students in Saudi Arabia. Few previous studies were
conducted in the Middle East region to investigate this issue
on nursing (Hassan & Wahsheh, 2011). Thus, this study
aimed (a) to assess AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and
risk perception among Saudi female students of college of
nursing, King Saud bin-Abdulaziz University for Health
Sciences, and (b) to identify predictors of willingness to pro-
vide care for patients with AIDS.
Study Design
A cross-sectional design was applied.
Study Area/Setting
The study was conducted in College of Nursing, King Saud
bin-Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, National
Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Study Participants
The target population of the study was the students of College
of Nursing (CON-R), KingAbdulaziz Medical City, National
Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. CON-R admits
female Saudi national mainly and awards a bachelor of sci-
ence in nursing (BSN) to two educational streams. Stream 1
has, as its intake, secondary school graduates and follows
what is known as the conventional program. Stream 2 admits
holders of bachelor of science degrees. These students fol-
low what is known as the Graduate Entry Accelerated
Program. This program is the first of its kind in the kingdom
of Saudi Arabia and is designed to expedite the process of
graduation by recognizing these students' previous learning,
thus, helping increase market supply of nurses faster. The
target sample of the study was all female students registered
in CON-R, and willing to participate during the academic
year 2009-2010 (around 340 students). Those who responded
to the study constituted 260 students with a response rate of
76.5%.
Data Collection Methods
All students were subjected to a self-administered question-
naire, previously administered to both San Franciscan
(Diclemente, Zorn, & Temoshok, 1986) and Irish (Doyle &
Conroy, 1991) adolescents, as well as the health care provid-
ers in Nigeria (Adebap, Bangbala, & Oyedirn, 2003). A pre-
viously validated Arabic version (Abolfotouh, 1995) of this
questionnaire with nursing-related modifications was used.
This questionnaire was composed of four parts:
1. Students' personal data such as age, origin, academic
level, previous information on AIDS, and source of
these information.
2. AIDS-related knowledge: This part consisted of a
total 51 statements. These statements addressed five
basic categories: cause of AIDS (5 statements),
Abolfotouh et al. 3
nature (16 statements), mode of transmission
(15 statements), treatment/control (7 statements),
and groups at high risk (8 statements). The correct
response was scored as "1," and the incorrect and
"Don't know" responses as "0." An overall knowl-
edge score was calculated by summing the scores for
statements, thus the highest possible score was 51
points. Percentage mean score (PMS) was estimated
for each category and for the overall knowledge
score.
3. Attitude of nursing students toward AIDS: This part
consisted of a total 19 statements, these statements
addressed three basic categories (Abolfotouh, 1995;
Adebap et al., 2003; Diclemente et al., 1986; Doyle
& Conroy, 1991): (a) attitudes toward people living
with AIDS (PLWA; 10 statements), (b) attitudes
toward care (4 statements), and (c) attitudes toward
precautionary measures (5 statements). Attitude
toward AIDS was measured on a 4-point Likert-type
scale, with 4 indicating strongly agree and 1 indicat-
ing strongly disagree. The 4-point scale, rather than a
5-point scale, was used to motivate respondents to
indicate either a positive or a negative attitude.
Approximately one half of the statements were
warded negatively to avoid a response set and were
reverse coded for data analysis. For analysis, points
"1"and "2" were combined to form the category
"positive attitude," while points "3" and "4" were
combined to form the category "negative attitude."
The instrument was piloted with 20 students for clarity and
comprehensiveness. Reliability measures for internal consis-
tency were not established prior to administration of the
instrument; however, Cronbach's alpha was conducted fol-
lowing data collection for the attitude scale. Obtained alpha
coefficients were as follows: overall instrument ( = .88), atti-
tude to AIDS patients ( = .83), attitude to provision of care
( = .65), and attitude to precautionary measures ( = .76).
Ethical Issues
The study was described and the surveys were distributed
during the recess, with an attached letter giving further infor-
mation including an explanation of rights and assurance of
anonymity. The students were informed that their decision
regarding participation would not affect their course grades
or their relationships with the faculty members. Only stu-
dents who were willing to participate in the study, after being
fully informed of the aim of the study and methodology,
were included in the target sample of the study Returned
completed instruments constituted consent to participate.
Students were asked not to write their names on the question-
naire form so as to be anonymous. Data were treated confi-
dentially by the primary investigator and co-investigators.
The study protocol received ethical approval from the Saudi
National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (Ref #
RC09/007).
Data Analysis
Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (Windows, ver-
sion 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statis-
tics such as mean, mode, median, and standard deviation
were applied to summarize the data. To compare between
categorical data, chi-square test was used. In the case of
variables having more than two categories, degrees of free-
dom are given with the chi-square statistic. For comparison
between numerical data, Student's t test, and analysis of
variance (ANOVA) were applied. To identify the significant
predictors for knowledge and attitudes (dependent vari-
ables) of students toward AIDS and PLWA, multiple linear
regression models were applied, with age (in years), origin
(urban, rural groups), academic year, stream group (SI and
SII) and previous information (yes, no) about AIDS as inde-
pendent variables. p value of <.05 was considered as the
level of significance.
Results
Part I: Demographic Data
The study included 280 nursing students, all of whom were
females (200 from Stream 1 and 60 from Stream 2). Their
mean age was 21.55 ± 2.56 years (minimum 17 years and
maximum 30 years). The distribution of their academic years
was as follows--1st year 65 (25%), 2nd year 51 (19.6%), 3rd
year 36 (13.8%), and 4th year 108 (41.5%)--the majority of
whom were of urban origin (92.7%). Students from Stream 2
were significantly older than those of Stream 1 (24.45 ± 2.07
years vs. 20.68 ± 2.00 years, t = 12.73, p < .001), and showed
higher proportion of students of rural origin (18.3% vs. 4.0%,
Fisher-exact [FET], p < .001; Table 1).
Almost all students reported previous information about
AIDS (97.6%). The primary source of information for stu-
dents was the media, constituting television and radio
(64.2%), the second most common source was their univer-
sity education (46.2%), followed by public lectures (31.1%).
Part II: Knowledge of AIDS
The students' knowledge PMS on AIDS was 72.93 ± 10.67
reflecting an average level of knowledge. However, it varied
with the different aspects of AIDS as follows: knowledge
related to cause (85.0 ± 18.18), nature (75.0 ± 12.46), mode
of transmission (70.0 ± 12.46), risk groups (68.50 ± 16.74),
and treatment (65.53 ± 22.42; Figure 1).
With regard to nature of AIDS, it was interesting that
about one half of students considered health team, patients in
hospitals, adolescents, and married women as groups of high
risk to contract AIDS. The question on the human fluids
4 SAGE Open
implicated in the transmission of HIV also attracted a range
of responses: blood and blood products (99.2%), semen
(93.1%), vaginal secretions (90.7%), saliva (63.2%), tears
(20.2%), and sweat (19%). The following incorrect options
attracted responses from the students about the mode of
transmission: use of same toilets and bathrooms and washing
clothes together (24.9%), swimming (53.7%), and coughing
and sneezing (49.6%). Meanwhile, about one fourth of stu-
dents reported mosquito bite as a mode of transmission for
HIV.
The students' knowledge was the lowest in treatment and
control of AIDS. One half of the students did not know that
there is at present no cure for this disease condition, and the
majority (73%) did not know that there is no vaccine yet for
prevention of AIDS contraction (Table 2).
Part III: Attitudes to AIDS
Nursing students reported an overall negative attitude toward
AIDS, as reflected by the PMS of 43.48 ± 9.21. This attitude
was the least favorable for precautionary measures (PMS =
29.29 ± 20.38), followed by attitude to patients living with
AIDS-PLWA (PMS = 40.50 ± 9.28), while it was the most
favorable for attitude to care of AIDS patients (PMS = 67.62
± 17.04; Figure 1).
With regard to attitude to PLWA, only one third of stu-
dents (32.3%) positively considered AIDS patients as vic-
tims of the society, one third (39.2%) considered HIV
carriers as unable to rear children, and 25.4% who agreed on
their right to have their diagnosis kept as a medical secret.
On the other hand, the majority of students (82.7%) nega-
tively agreed not to allow seropositive women get pregnant
(Table 3).
With regard to attitude to care of AIDS patients, more
than one half of students (55.1%) negatively agreed that
treating PLWAs puts health workers at high risk. Another
half (46.7%) negatively reported that they would not be
happy to work with a colleague who was an HIV carrier.
With regard to attitude to precautionary measures, the
majority of students negatively agreed that AIDS patients
and/or carriers be isolated from other patients (83.0%), have
their care in specialized hospitals (89.6%), and not allowed
to share a room with noninfected patients (81.8%).
Meanwhile, those who positively disagreed to wear gloves
when touching a patient with AIDS were only 15.7% of all
students. Higher PMS of attitude to precautionary measures
was significantly associated with Stream1 before (p = .019)
and after adjustment (p = .038; Tables 4 and 5).
The present study showed that knowledge score of the
students had no significant association with any of the atti-
tude categories, PLWA (t = 1.27, p = .21), care (t = 1.79, p =
.075), precautionary measures (t = .92, p = .36), and overall
attitude (t = .22, p = .82).
Part IV: Predictors of Knowledge on and Attitude
Toward AIDS and Patients
As the grades of the students increased, the total mean per-
centage score of knowledge rose significantly (F = 4.64, p =
.004), Students with previous knowledge showed signifi-
cantly higher PMS of knowledge than those without (t =
2.62, p = .01; Table 4). However, after adjustment for poten-
tial confounders, higher knowledge PMS was significantly
associated with Stream 1 (p = .012), older age (p < .001), and
having previous information on AIDS (p = .006; Table 5).
With regard to attitude, PMS of attitude to PLWA was sig-
nificantly higher in younger age (p = .015), but this associa-
tion disappeared after adjustment for other confounders (p =
.18). Higher PMS of attitude to provide care to patients was
significantly associated with Stream 1 (p < .001), and
younger age (p = .007). However, association with Stream 1
was the only significant association that remained after
adjusting for other confounders (p = .004). Higher PMS of
attitude to precautionary measures was significantly associ-
ated with Stream 1 before (p = .019) and after adjustment
(p = .038; Table 4). Higher PMS of overall attitude to AIDS
was significantly associated with Stream 1 (p < .001) and
younger age (p = .009). However, after adjusting for age,
origin, academic year, and previous information, Stream 1
was the only significant predictor of higher score of overall
attitude (p = .011; Table 5).
Discussion
Early in the HIV/AIDS health crises, several studies revealed
patterns of reluctance to care for persons with AIDS among
nursing students (Earl & Penney, 2003). These findings were
of great concern, because it is very likely at some time nurses
will be caring for people with AIDS. Students in the present
study were quite knowledgeable about the basic facts regard-
ing AIDS such as; its cause and nature and the ways in which
HIV is transmitted. This finding was consistent with the
studies of Lohrmann et al. (2000), Peate et al. (Abolfotouh,

1995), and Bektas and Kulakac (2007). However, there were
many misconceptions about how HIV is transmitted, for
example, shaking hands, using the same toilet or bathroom,
and so on. This problem was also addressed by previous
investigators such as Tavocas, Zaferani, Enzevaei, and Tajik
(2004); Bektas and Kulakac; and Badahdah and Sayem
(2010). Some of the Saudi nursing students were not aware
that there was no cure for AIDS with medication or vaccine.
However, this finding was in agreement with that of Turkish
nursing students (Bektas & Kulakac, 2007). Perhaps the stu-
dents were not educated enough about AIDS to be able to
distinguish between antiretroviral therapy and a cure for
AIDS (Badahdah & Sayem, 2010).
Negative attitudes toward PLWA can interfere with the
quality of nursing care and can cause stress to nurses and
patients alike (Earl & Penney, 2003; Martin & Bedimo, 2000).
In the present study, there was a substantial negative attitude
toward AIDS and HIV-positive patients. This finding was in
agreement with the U.K. (Earl & Penney, 2003) and Turkish
studies (Bektas & Kulakac, 2007). Yet, this finding was not
consistent with the findings of Halpern, Rodrigue, Boggs, and
Greene's (1993) study, where nursing students did not have
fears of AIDS, and did not judge individuals with AIDS in a
negative way as stated by Lohrmann et al. (2000). In the pres-
ent study, despite relatively high levels of knowledge about
AIDS and its modes of transmission, levels of fear about the
disease and prejudicial attitudes toward AIDS and AIDS
patients remain. Levels of fear were very high as shown by
the students' desire to identify and quarantine AIDS patients
in clinical and societal settings. The majority of students
agreed that AIDS patients should be isolated from other
patients, and should not share the room with other nonin-
fected patients. This tendency may be motivated by the stu-
dents' perception that AIDS is a punishment from God.
Studies from around the world and from the EMR region
have shown similar attitudes (Ayranci, 2005; Kopelman,
2002; Montazeri, 2004; Tebourski & Ben Alaya, 2004).
One of the structural factors that has been the target of
AIDS prevention efforts is stigma (Heijnders & Van Der
Meij, 2006). The findings of previous studies reported that
the stigmatization from nursing students was the mode of
transmission of AIDS virus, where students were most stig-
matizing toward those who contracted the disease through
injecting drugs and sexual transmission, and least

stigmatizing toward those who contracted the virus through
maternal and blood transmission (Earl & Penney, 2003).
Saudi Arabia is a Muslim country with conservative cultural
values where premarital sex is prohibited and female virgin-
ity is the rule. Students in the present study saw AIDS as a
punitive consequence of a promiscuous sex life. This explains
the finding of a low overall attitude toward PLWA. The
majority of students reported that AIDS is a threat to health
workers and that AIDS sufferers should be considered as vic-
tims of the society. Moreover, some of students reported that
PLWA deserve what has happened to them.
The matter of choice in treating AIDS patients remains a
knotty and sensitive issue; caregivers are often portrayed as
fearful, ill-informed, and discriminatory in their treatment
of AIDS patients (Uwakwe, 2000). In the present study,
almost all students agreed that all patients should be treated
irrespective of their HIV status, although one half of all
students agreed that treating PLWA puts health workers at
high risk.
It is clear that many rural nursing students have had lim-
ited experience with HIV/AIDS patients, and have rarely had
opportunities to discuss their feelings about the disease. In
addition, students' attitudes about caring for AIDS patients
have not changed over the past decade (Earl & Penney,
2003). In the present study, no significant difference was
detected between students of rural and those of urban origin,
in terms of knowledge on and attitude toward the disease. In
a Turkish study, nursing students who were sexually active
had a significantly higher knowledge level compared with
those who were sexually inactive (Bektas & Kulakac, 2007).
However, the Saudi population is generally known as a con-
servative community that observes Islamic rules, irrespec-
tive of the origin of the individual. However, previous
information was a significant predictor of the overall knowl-
edge, even after adjusting for the possible confounders.
However, this was not the case for attitude. The primary
source of information about AIDS for students was their
university education. The second most common source was
the media, constituting TV and radio. This finding was simi-
lar to that reported on Turkish nursing students (Bektas &
Kulakac, 2007).
It would be a safe assumption to assert that the relation-
ship between knowledge and attitude among students would
appear to have followed a similar pattern to that observed
within the general public (Uwakwe, 2000). In Turkish study,
as the knowledge score increased, willingness to care for
PLWA also increased significantly (Bektas & Kulakac,
2007). However, in the present study, knowledge score
showed no significant association with any of the attitude
categories.
It is important to examine whether nursing education has
an impact on the willingness of students to care for AIDS
patients and on potential determinants of such willingness
(Jemmott, Jemmot III, & Cruz-Collins, 1992). While
Uwakwe (2000) reported that willingness to provide care
was greater among students with greater nursing education,
others showed that students with more undergraduate nurs-
ing education were higher in homophobia (Jemmott et al.,
1992). In the present study, there was a significant associa-
tion between academic year and overall knowledge score,
with the 1st year students showing significantly lower score,
a finding that was in agreement with the findings on Turkish
students (Bektas & Kulakac, 2007), where the total knowl-
edge score rose significantly with increasing grade. However,
after adjustment for all potential variables, the association
did not remain significant.
The educational preparation of nurses providing care to
persons with AIDS has been known to affect the attitude of
the nurses and the effectiveness of the care provided to people
with AIDS (Earl & Penney, 2003). In the present study,
Stream 1 students, who received nursing education as their
main and only college education, showed significantly higher
score of attitude to care of patients with AIDS and attitude to
precautionary measures as well as significantly higher overall
10 SAGE Open
attitude to AIDs. Moreover, after adjusting for potential con-
founders, the unwillingness to care for patients with AIDS
was associated only with having never been taught nursing
education as their primary university education.
Study Limitations
Our study had some limitations. First, the study was limited
by the relatively small sample size, especially those of
Stream 2 students, for which the primary university educa-
tion was not nursing education. Thus, it would be important
to increase this in the future. Second, the study used a cross-
sectional design that did not allow for the assessment of the
temporality of the relationship between the levels of attitude
and knowledge on AIDS and other predictors such as age,
academic year, origin, and previous information. Third, the
background of Stream 2 students whose primary university
education was not nursing education has not been investi-
gated in terms of the reason for enrolment in nursing college
and experience with their previous university education
before enrollment in nursing college. Further studies may
highlight all of these issues.
In conclusion, and considering the sample as a whole,
nursing students in the present study were quite knowledge-
able about the basic facts regarding AIDS and the ways in
which HIV is transmitted. The chief areas of weakness con-
cerned misconceptions about the transmission of HIV
through casual contact and exposure to saliva of infected per-
sons. AIDS education efforts aimed at nursing students
should place greater emphasis on correcting these kinds of
misconceptions.
General attitudes toward PLWA were negative and the
students' homophobia level was high. The best weapon
against fear and ignorance is education. The entire curricu-
lum must be examined to clarify how the care of individuals
with any infectious disease is addressed. It has been reported
that nursing students taking a training course about AIDS
significantly increased knowledge and developed more posi-
tive beliefs about individuals with AIDS (Carney, Werth, &
Martin, 1999). Special emphasis should be on the value that
such patients be treated humanely.
Unwillingness to care for patients with AIDS was associ-
ated only with having never been taught nursing education as
the primary university education. Selection of students of
Stream 2 for whom nursing education is not the primary uni-
versity education should be looked at. The balance between
the desire to increase market supply of nurses faster, to com-
pensate for shortage of nurses, and the quality of nursing
practice in Saudi Arabia must be investigated.
