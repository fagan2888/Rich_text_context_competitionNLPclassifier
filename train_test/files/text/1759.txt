Abstract The association between educational attainment and self-assessed health is well
established but the mechanisms that explain this association are not fully understood yet. It is
likely that part of the association is spurious because (genetic and non-genetic) characteristics
of a person's family of origin simultaneously affect one's educational attainment and one's
adult health. In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the association between education and
health, we have to control for all relevant family factors. In practice, however, it is impossible
to measure all relevant family factors. Sibling models are particularly appropriate in this case,
because they control for the total impact of family factors, even if not all relevant aspects can
be measured. I use data on siblings from a US study (MIDUS) and Dutch study (NKPS) to
assess thetotal family impact on self-assessed health and,more importantly, toassess whether
there is a family bias in the association between educational attainment and self-assessed
health. The results suggest that there is a substantial family effect; about 20% of the variation
in self-assessed health between siblings can be ascribed to (measured and unmeasured)
family factors. Measured family factors, such as parental education and father's occupation,
could account only for a small part of the family effect. Furthermore, the results imply that it is
unlikely that there is substantial bias due to family effects in the association between edu-
cation and self-assessed health. This strengthens the conclusions from prior studies on the
association between education and self-assessed health.

1 Introduction
One of the most persistent findings with regard to questions about social inequality and life
chances is the educational gradient in health and mortality (Antonovsky 1967; Huisman

et al. 2005; Lynch 2001; Von dem Knesebeck et al. 2006). People with more education
report better health and have longer life expectancies than lower educated people. The
educational gradient in health has been documented for a variety of societies and time
periods (Von dem Knesebeck et al. 2006). These health differences are not only observed
between the highest and lowest educated groups, but health differences are found between
all consecutive steps on the educational ladder (Erikson 2001).
Despite the large number of studies on health inequalities, many fundamental questions
remain concerning the nature and causes of the association between education and health
(Banks et al. 2006; Marmot and Wilkinson 2005; Phelan et al. 2004). One of these
questions concerns the role of the family of origin. On the one hand, there is a strand of
literature that studies the association between the socio-economic position of the family of
origin and adult health (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Graham 2002; Van de Mheen et al.
1997). Studies in this literature suggest that the socio-economic position of the family of
origin is important for adult health. We know, on the other hand, from sociological studies,
that the family of origin also plays an important role in determining an individual's
educational attainment. In this paper, these two lines of research are brought together by
studying the total family impact on self-assessed health and, more importantly, by
assessing to what extent the association between education and health is biased by mea-
sured and unmeasured family factors that affect both education and health. In doing so, two
important issues are addressed that have received little attention in the literature so far.
First, only a few characteristics of the family of origin have been included in studies on
adult health. Typically information on father's socio-economic position during the
respondent's childhood was available (Hertzman et al. 2001; Power et al. 1998; Van de
Mheen et al. 1997). Although this is an important characteristic of the family of origin,
many other family factors might be important as well, such as, for example, genes, life-
style, or the family's social network. Thus, the total effect of the family of origin on adult
health might be much stronger than suggested by studies that can only incorporate father's
social class. This lack of measured family factors raises two questions: How large is the
total family impact on self-assessed health? (Or, in other words, to what extent do family
factors explain differences in adult self-assessed health?) And: How well do measured
characteristics of the family of origin cover the total effect of the family of origin on adult
health?
The second issue that has received little attention so far, is the question to what extent
the association between education and self-assessed health is biased if not all family factors
are taken into account. A serious bias could exist if some of the family factors that
determine adult health are also important for educational attainment. Part of the association
between education and health could actually be the result of growing up in a particular
family rather than a true effect of education on health.
Prior studies primarily aimed at quantifying the additional importance of childhood
circumstances for adult self-assessed health (after controlling for the current situation).
They did not address the question whether education and health have important family
factors in common. For example, we know that parental social class strongly affects
children's education attainment (Hout and Diprete 2006; Shavit and Blossfeld 1993) as
well as their health status in adulthood (Power et al. 1998). As a result, not taking into
account parental social class would overestimate the association between education and
health. A bias could also result from family factors that are not measured in the sample. To
advance our understanding of educational differences in health, it is important to know the
extent to which the association between education and health reflects the `unbiased effect'
of schooling. This is especially important for explanatory studies, such as Lynch (2001),
322 C. W. S. Monden
123
Stronks et al. (1996) and Van Lenthe et al. (2002) that can not take all family factors into
account.
One of the reasons that the above mentioned questions have received little attention is
that the majority of studies analyses samples of unrelated individuals. Samples with such a
design can not be used to answer questions about total family effects adequately. Instead,
samples are needed that contain multiple persons per family (i.e., siblings or twins). If we
observe two or more siblings per family, we can draw conclusions about the total family
effect by studying the shared variation among the siblings' outcomes. Sibling analysis
makes it possible to assess how much of the variation in health and education is linked to
family factors and to estimate the relative importance of measured and unmeasured family
factors. The difference between sibling data and twin data is that the latter, given a number
of assumptions, allows splitting the total family effect into genetic and non-genetic family
components. Sibling studies have been used in various fields, for instance to assess the total
family effect and `unbiased effects' of schooling for outcomes such as income (Griliches
1979), occupational status (Hauser and Mossel 1985), cultural consumption (Van Eijck
1996), social stratification and social orientations (Sieben 2001). So far, there has been
little investigation of the total family effect for self-assessed health (but see the twin
studies discussed below). The current study focuses on self-assessed health, which is the
most frequently used health indicator in social sciences (Ferraro and Farmer 1999).
To sum up, I address the following questions: (1) How large is the total family effect on
self-assessed health? (2) To what extent do measured aspects of the family's socio-eco-
nomic status account for this total family effect? and (3) To what extent is the association
between education and self-assessed health biased by measured and unmeasured family
factors?
2 Theory and Prior Research
As the research questions of this study are explorative it does not seem informative to
formulate precise hypotheses (e.g., a hypothesis on the exact size of the family effect on
self-assessed health). However, building on insights from sociology and social epidemi-
ology and prior research, I will formulate a general hypothesis for each of the three
research questions.
Regarding the first research question, there is ample reason to assume that there is a
substantial family effect on adult self-assessed health. One's health status at a particular
moment in time is not simply the result of current circumstances and behaviour, but rather
the result of exposure to various circumstances and behaviour over the life course (Lynch
and Kaplan 1997; Wadsworth 1997, 1999). Many physical conditions and also behaviour
early in life are shaped by the family of origin. Furthermore, there is probably a genetic
impact of the family. Thus, we can distinguish three mechanisms to explain how family
factors influence adult self-assessed health: genetic, material and cultural factors. Below
each one is discussed briefly.
First, an obviously shared family factor is genetic endowment. If self-assessed health
has important genetic determinants, then we would expect siblings to show considerable
similarities in health. Twin studies, however, have yielded mixed evidence about the
genetic family component of self-assessed health. Two American studies on male twins
(Romeis et al. 2000, 2005), two Finish studies (Leinonen et al. 2005; Silventoinen et al.
2007), two Swedish studies (Harris et al. 1992; Lichtenstein et al. 1993), one Danish study
(Christensen et al. 1999) and one Norwegian study (Roysamb et al. 2003) have estimated
Do Measured and Unmeasured Family Factors Bias 323

to what extent the resemblance in self-assessed health between twins can be attributed to
family factors (genetic factors and the shared environment) on the one hand and individual
factors (non-shared environment) on the other. The importance of the family factors in
these studies varies strongly by country, sex and age. The percentage of variance that can
be explained by the genetic family factor ranges from 15% to well over 50% in the
different samples. In one subsample no genetic component was found (Harris et al. 1992).
Some studies find that non-genetic family factors are associated with self-assessed health,
whereas others conclude that only the genetic family factor is important (Romeis et al.
2000, 2005). Overall, these studies support the idea that family factors partly determine
self-assessed health, although it remains an open question to what extent this family effect
can be attributed to genetic factors, material family factors or cultural family factors.
The second family factor concerns material circumstances. Several authors have argued
that growing up in materially less advantageous circumstances can have lasting negative
effects on health (Blane et al. 1996; Hertzman et al. 2001; Lundberg 1993; Power et al.
1998; Van de Mheen et al. 1997). Crowded and poor housing, poor nutrition, low access to
(preventive) health care as well as financial stress could have long-lasting effects on health.
These adverse material circumstances are strongly related to low socio-economic status.
Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown significant associations between adult
health and childhood material circumstances as measured by father's socio-economic
status.
Third, the family of origin may shape lifestyles and attitudes that are relevant for health.
Important health related behaviours such as smoking, dietary habits and exercise are, in
part, influenced by family culture in childhood and adolescence. Also, attitudes and beliefs
about health and health care may be influence by the family of origin. In sum, the above-
mentioned genetic, material and cultural factors related to the family of origin would lead
us the expect a low to moderate correlation between the health statuses of adult siblings.
Next I turn to the second research question. If we find significant resemblance in self-
assessed health and education among siblings, can `standard measures' of family factors,
such as father's socio-economic position, explain the whole family effect? In the literature,
parental social class and parental education are the most frequently used family indicators
(Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Power et al. 1998). In addition also indicators of financial
hardship during childhood are sometimes used (Lundberg 1993). These family factors are
also available in the data used for the current study. But apart from the measured family
factors, many potentially important family factors remain unmeasured or are only partly
picked up by the measures of social class. Relevant aspects of the family concerning
housing, the neighbourhood, culture and lifestyles remain unobserved and are not (fully)
captured by the standard socio-economic indicators. Again, it is impossible to formulate a
hypothesis about exactly what proportion of the total family effect is captured by the
measured factors. Therefore the following more explorative hypothesis is formulated:
measured socio-economic family characteristics explain a substantial part of the total
family effect on self-assessed health.
The final question is whether there is substantial overlap between family factors that
determine adult health, on the one hand, and family factors that influence educational
attainment on the other hand. If there is such overlap the association between education
and health would be partly spurious. In other words, the association is biased by family
factors in studies that do not or can not take all possible family factors into account. It
seems reasonable to expect at least some overlap in the relevant family factors. The
family's socio-economic position is likely to affect both outcomes, albeit possibly through
different mechanisms. The health effects of the family's position may be more related to
324 C. W. S. Monden
123
the material circumstances whereas the effect on educational outcomes may be more
related to cultural factors and ambition. Sociological research has shown a persistent
association between parental educational level and father's occupation on children's
educational attainment (Blau and Duncan 1967; Hout and Diprete 2006; Sieben 2001) and
these factors are also related to adult health.
There might also be genetic factors that affect education and health simultaneously.
There is empirical evidence suggesting that some genetic factors that are related to self-
assessed health are also related to education (Lichtenstein et al. 1993). Lichtenstein et al.
(1993) found a correlation of r = 0.21 between the genetic family factor for self-assessed
health and that for education. They also found a correlation of r = 0.26 between the factor
for shared family environment (i.e., non-genetic family aspects) related to self-assessed
health and that related to education. This suggests that another part of the association
between education and health is caused by common non-genetic family factors. Although
these correlations are not high, they do suggest that the effect of education on health is
partly spurious. Therefore, I will test the hypothesis that the association between education
and self-assessed health is upwardly biased if not controlled for measured and unmeasured
family factors.
To sum, the expectation is that there indeed is a family effect on self-assessed health,
which is partly explained by parental education and occupation, and that the pure effect of
education on health will be smaller, but still significant, after taking all possible family
factors into account.
3 Data
There are only few data sets that include relevant information on education, health and
family background for adult siblings. I use an American and Dutch data set.
3.1 US Sample
The US data come from the MacArthur Foundation Midlife Development in the United
States survey (MIDUS) (Brim et al. 2004). This is a national telephone and mail survey
carried out in 1995­1996 under the auspices of the John and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation Network on Successful Midlife Development (ICPSR 2760). A sample ranging
in age from 25 to 74 years, was recruited from a random-digit-dial sampling frame of the
coterminous United States and oversampling in five metropolitan areas. One respondent
was selected from each eligible household. The survey was carried out in two phases: a
telephone interview followed by a self-administered mail questionnaire. The phase 1
response rate was 70%, and the conditional phase 2 response rate was 87%, with an overall
response rate of 61%. There are 4,242 cases (primary respondents) in the main sample.
Non-twin siblings were enrolled by sending a postcard to all respondents, asking them
to provide contact information for their siblings. Since the family study was a secondary
aim of the project, no elaborate non-response procedures were employed. While the
number of eligible respondents who provided the names and addresses of their siblings was
low (20%), the cooperation rate for the sibling sample was high (69%). In total 951 siblings
were interviewed. The number of siblings from a single family ranged from one to six,
including one sibling from 272 families, two from 146 families, three from 75 families,
four from 22 families, five from 10 families, and six from four families. I constructed all
possible sibling-pairs and applied a family weight to give each family equal influence in

123
the analysis. Apparently sisters were more willing to give each other's addresses. This is in
line with the finding that sister-sister relationships are stronger than brother-brother or
mixed-sex sibling relationships (Lee et al. 1990). As a result there is an overrepresentation
of females in the MIDUS sample.
MIDUS includes a standard single-item question about general health: ``in general,
would you say your physical health is... (1) excellent, (2) very good, (3) good, (4) fair or
(5) poor?'' Self-assessed health has repeatedly been shown to be a good indicator of
general health (Ferraro and Farmer 1999; McHorney 2000). In a longitudinal population-
based study Mossey and Shapiro (1982) showed that self-assessed health predicts mortality
independently of age, sex, ``objective health status'', life satisfaction, income and resi-
dence. Moreover, the association of self-assessed health with mortality was stronger than
the association between objective health status and mortality. Many other authors have
reported similar results for a variety of populations, countries and age-groups (Benyamini
and Idler 1999; Idler and Benyamini 1997).
Information provided by the primary respondent and siblings on their own educational
attainment is used. Education is coded in years of completed education. The primary
respondent also reported the educational attainment of both parents and the father's
occupation at the time when the respondent was an adolescent (``Tell me about the job he
had for the longest time during your adolescence--when you were 12­18 years old'').
Father's occupation is converted to manual or non-manual. I use mother's education and
father's occupation. Finally, I use the answer to a question about the family's financial
situation: ``When you were growing up, was your family better off or worse off financially
than the average family was at that time? (1) A lot better off to (7) A lot worse off''.
3.2 Dutch Sample
The data I use for the Netherlands come from a large-scale study of family relations: the
Netherlands' Kinship Panel Study (Dykstra et al. 2005). The NKPS is a nationally rep-
resentative survey among 8,155 primary respondents aged 18­79. Residents of care-
institutions, penitentiaries, homes for the elderly, and holiday homes were excluded from
the sample frame. The data were gathered in 2002­2004. Interviews were held with
respondents at home using CAPI face-to-face interviews and self-administered question-
naires. The overall response rate was 45%, which is low compared to the US but about
average for the Netherlands.
For each primary respondent who had living brothers or sisters, one sibling was ran-
domly selected to be interviewed as well. The primary respondents were asked to provide
the address and grant permission to contact the sibling. This permission was granted by
60% of the respondents who had a living sibling. The response rate among the siblings was
63%. I select siblings in the 24­75 age range to match the MIDUS sample. In total,
information from 2,289 siblings is used.
The health question in NKPS is similar to the one in MIDUS except that the answer
categories differ slightly: ``(1) excellent, (2) good, (3) not bad and not good, (4) poor, or (5)
very poor''.
The primary respondent and sibling report their highest obtained diploma. This infor-
mation is converted to total years of education. Additionally, the primary respondent was
asked to report father's and mother's education and father's occupation when the
respondent was about 15 years old. The occupational title is converted to manual or non-
manual. NKPS also offers an indicator of parents' wealth: whether family was home owner
or renting a house when the respondent was 15 years old. In the Netherlands, this is a good

indicator of the family's wealth. Descriptive statistics for both samples are given in
Table 1.
4 Methods
To assess the total family effect, Hauser-Mossel sibling-models (Hauser and Mossel 1985;
Sieben 2001; Van Eijck 1996) are estimated. Originally, these models were designed to test
the effect of family background on occupational attainment, but the technique can be used
for any outcome.
The more important the family is, the higher the resemblance among brothers and sisters
will be. Thus, sibling resemblance can be used as an estimate for the total effect of family
factors (including all shared genetic, environmental, social, and cultural factors). The
sibling model decomposes the variance in the dependent variable into a family component
(also called `between-family') and an individual component (also called `within-family').
The first refers to the variance that siblings have in common, the second to individual
deviations from the common variance. Structural equation models make it possible to
assess family (between-family) and individual (within-family) regression coefficients, as
depicted in Fig. 1. The square boxes in Fig. 1 indicate observed variables, the ovals
indicate latent variables. The loadings of the latent variables are constrained to equal 1.
The individual regression coefficient represents the individual association between edu-
cation and health, controlled for all family effects. If there is no family effect, the family
regression coefficient and individual regression coefficient will be equal. However, if the
family regression coefficient is significantly larger, in a better fitting model, than the
individual family regression coefficient, then this indicates a family bias in the effect of
education on health. By adding measured family characteristics to the model, one can
estimate how much of the total family-effect is captured by these characteristics. This way,
hypotheses can be tested about the nature of, at least part of, the family's influence. The
siblings models are estimated as structural equation models using Lisrel 8 (Jo
¨reskog and
So
¨rbom 1993).
Five regression models are estimated. The first two models (A1 and A2) are conven-
tional regression models in which siblings' health is regressed on age, gender, education

and four measured family characteristics. Because siblings are not independent observa-
tions, robust standard errors are used that correct for clustering within families (Rogers
1983; Williams 2000). These models are the reference models. The coefficients for edu-
cation can be compared to the individual regression coefficient of education in the three
siblings models (B1 to B3). The individual regression coefficient is set equal for both
siblings in these models. The first sibling model, Model B1, assumes that the individual
and family regression coefficients of education on health are equal. This equality constraint
is relaxed in Model B2. If Model B2 has a significantly better fit than B1, there is a family
bias in the educational effect on self-assessed health. In Model B3, I add observed family
factors. How much the observed family factors contribute to the total family effect is
indicated by the change (reduction) in the size of the family regression coefficient for
education between Model B2 and Model B3. It is also reflected in the increase of the
proportion of explained variance at the family level between the two models.
5 Results
5.1 Sibling Correlations
Table 2 shows the sibling correlations in education and self-assessed health. The results in
this table are in line with earlier findings on sibling resemblance in education (Hauser and
Mossel 1985; Lichtenstein et al. 1993). Four observations can be made from this table.
First, sibling correlations for educational attainment are about twice as high as the sibling
correlations for self-assessed health (the 95% confidence-intervals of the two correlation
coefficients do not overlap). This suggests that the total family impact on adult self-
assessed health is much smaller than the family effect on educational attainment.

variables; ovals indicate latent variables in the structural equations model. The two individual regression
coefficients (within-family regression) are set equal to each other

Second, sibling correlations tend to be higher among same-sex pairs than among mixed-
sex pairs. This pattern holds for education as well as for self-assessed health. The corre-
lation coefficients for education differ significantly between mixed sibling pairs and same-
sex pairs in both samples. For health the same pattern is observed, but the correlation
coefficients are not significantly different at the 5% significance level. Curiously, the
sibling correlation for self-assessed health among US male sibling pairs seems much lower
than the sibling correlation among female US pair and male and female Dutch sibling
pairs. Note, however, that the difference between these correlation coefficients is only
borderline significant (at a significance level of 10%).
The third observation is that sibling correlation for education is higher in female pairs
than in male pairs. This difference is found in both samples and statistically significant in
the Dutch sample. This suggests that the family is more important for women's education
than for men's. Van Eijck (1996) showed that family background explains a larger pro-
portion of variance in women's education compared to men in the Netherlands. However,
this is most likely due to the smaller variance in women's education rather than to a larger
impact of the family of origin (Van Eijck 1996).
Finally, we can observe in Table 2 that, despite some difference among the subgroups
of sibling pairs, the overall correlations in the US and the Netherlands are quite similar;
0.16 and 0.17 for health and 0.40 and 0.37 for education in the US sample and Dutch
sample, respectively. These small differences between the samples are not statistically
significant.
In the remainder of this paper, I will analyse same-sex sibling pairs only. As mentioned
above, the sibling correlations are systematically lower among mixed pairs compared to
same-sex pairs (the differences are significant for education in both samples). The lower
sibling correlations in mixed pairs suggests that the family is less important than the sibling
correlations for male and female pairs imply. Thus, using the mixed sibling pairs raises
important questions about differences between men and women in the variation in edu-
cation and health and questions about how the family affects sons and daughters differ-
ently. As a result, mixed pairs would complicate the interpretation of the analysis. In order
to obtain a clear picture about the impact of the family, I analyse male and female same-
sex pairs simultaneously while taking into account age and sex. Splitting the analyses by
sex would result in even smaller sample sizes. Working with small samples is not infor-
mative, because it increases the chance of type I or II errors. Studies on self-assessed health
usually find relatively small effect sizes. Therefore, splitting the analyses into several
subgroups would lead to imprecise estimates.

5.2 Conventional Models
Table 3 reports the outcome of conventional models (A1­A2) and siblings models (B1­
B3) regressing self-assessed health on education for the US and Dutch sample. These
analyses allow us to assess the total family effect on adult health and the `unbiased'
association between educational attainment and self-assessed health.
For the US sample, the conventional models show that there is a significant association
between education and self-assessed health. Respondents with more years of schooling
report better health than those with less education. The effect size is not particularly big. A
10 year difference in schooling corresponds to one standard deviation difference in health.
The maximum educational difference is about 16 years; this difference in education cor-
responds to about 1.3 points on the 1­5 health scale.
By comparing the regression coefficients for education between Model A1 and Model
A2, we can see whether the effect of education is overestimated in the conventional model
if not corrected for observed family characteristics. Adding socio-economic characteristics
of the family of origin reduces the coefficient for education by 20%, but this difference is
not statistically significant. Given the relatively small sample size it is not surprising that
the measured family factors do not reach statistical significance at the 5% level. The effects
of mother's education and father's occupational class are both borderline significant.
5.3 Sibling Models
Next we turn to the sibling models. The first sibling model for the US sample constrains the
individual and family regression coefficients for education to be equal. As can be observed
from Table 3, the regression coefficient for education in Model B1 is almost equal to that
in Model A1. The additional information that the sibling model gives us is a decomposition
of the variance in self-assessed health. About one-fifth of the differences in self-assessed
health among the respondents can be attributed to family factors. Note that this concerns all
possible family factors; either social, genetic, observed or unobserved. Part of this family
variance component is simply caused by the composition of families in terms of the
siblings' age, sex and educational attainment. About 13% of the family variance can be
ascribed to differences in composition. Most of the total variance consists of difference
between individuals. About 9% of this remaining individual variance can be explained by
age, sex and education.
In the second sibling model, the individual and family regression coefficients for
education are allowed to vary freely. Relaxing the constraint does not significantly improve
the model fit, as can been seen in the last two columns of Table 3. This suggests that,
although the family coefficient for education is somewhat larger than the individual
coefficient, there is no substantial family bias in the association between education and
self-assessed health.
In Model B3, measured family factors are included in the sibling model. Adding these
variables leads to a better fit compared to a model in which the effects of these variables
are constrained to equal zero (chi-square of 81 with 32 degrees of freedom). The family
coefficient for education is now much smaller and an additional 12% of the family variance
in self-assessed health can be explained, mainly by mothers education and father's class
(due to small sample size these effects do not reach statistical significance).
In addition to these three sibling models, I estimated Model B3 with an equality con-
strain on the individual and family regression coefficients for education. All results were
similar to the unconstrained model except for the educational coefficient, which became

0.066 (virtually the same as in Model A1). This model has a similar fit but uses one degree
of freedom less compared to the unconstrained model, suggesting there is hardly any
family bias in the association between education and self-assessed health if standard family
factors are taken into account.
The qualitative results for the Dutch sample are quite similar to those of the US sample.
The educational differences in health appear to be smaller in the Netherlands, but also
among the Dutch siblings there is a significant and positive association between self-
assessed health and education. Again, about one-fifth (18%) of the variation in self-assessed
health can be attributed to the family of origin. Education, age and sex explain less of the
total variation in the Dutch sample than in the US sample. This holds true for both the family
level as well as the individual level. Parental education, occupation and home ownership
account for a small proportion of the total family effect, namely about 6%. Comparing the
coefficient for education in Model A2 with the family coefficient for education in Model B3
shows whether not taking into account the total family effect causes a bias in the effect of
education. The educational coefficients in all five models are very similar and do not differ
significantly from one another. Thus, there is no indication that there is a family bias in the
association between education and self-assessed health in the Dutch sample.
6 Conclusions
The aim of this paper was (1) to estimate the total family effect on self-assessed health (2)
to determine what proportion of the family effect is tapped by measured socio-economic
variables of the family of origin, and (3) to assess to what extent the association between
education and self-assessed health is biased if family factors are not taken into account.
To answer these questions, sibling data from the US and the Netherlands were used.
Overall, the sibling models showed that there is more within-family variance than between-
family variance in self-assessed health. In other words, individual differences seem to be
much more important than differences between families. About 20% of the variation in
self-assessed health is related to family factors, including all genetic, material and cultural
factors (both measured and unmeasured). The remaining 80% of the variation in self-
assessed health has to be attributed to purely individual differences. The total family effect
on self-assessed health appears to be of equal magnitude in the two samples.
Standard indicators for the family of origin, father's occupational class (manual or non-
manual) and parental education, appear to explain only a small part of the total family effect.
For the US sample one-eighth of the family variance in adult self-assessed health can be
explained by parental education, father's manual/non-manual class and financial well-being.
Another one-eighth of the family variation is due to differences in age, sex and educational
attainment of the siblings. In the Dutch sample, only 6% of the variation at the family level
could be explained by measured family factors. It is important to note that in many data sets
more indicators of the family's socio-economic position are available and that the indicators
used in this study can be measure in much more detail. It remains an open question whether
using more detailed family indicators would make a substantial difference.
No evidence was found for a substantial `family bias' in the association between
education and self-assessed health. This suggests that conventional analyses can be used to
estimate largely `unbiased effects' of education on self-assessed health if measured indi-
cators of the family of origin are controlled for. This strengthens the conclusions from
previous studies that seek to explain the association between education and self-assessed
health.

At the same time, these results increase the need to come up with better explanations for
the association between education and self-assessed health. And the 20% variation due to
family factors calls for new studies to better understand the family of origin effects on adult
health. Such studies should use twin and sibling designs as well as longitudinal individual
designs. Which factors could be responsible for the unexplained part of the family effect on
self-assessed health? A first logical candidate seems a genetic factor (or rather: genetic
factors). Another candidate would be family culture, especially family habits related to
health and health related behaviour. Although health related behaviour is correlated with
the socio-economic position of the family it is likely that families develop specific habits
and health beliefs that are largely independent of their socio-economic position.
This study found higher sibling correlations for education than for adult self-assessed
health, suggesting family factors are more important for educational attainment. Why
would shared family factors be less important for adult health? One possible explanation is
that during the period when educational attainment is `determined' for most people,
brothers and sisters live at home with (one of their) parents and the environment to which
they are exposed is quite similar. One's health condition, on the other hand, is shaped
continuously over the life course. During adult life, siblings do not share the family home
and environment anymore. The circumstances siblings life in become more divergent
during adulthood. This would explain lower sibling resemblance later in life for outcomes
that have important environmental, social and cultural determinants.
Some limitations of the study need to be discussed as well. The samples were quite
small and prior studies (i.e., twin studies on self-assessed health) showed mixed results.
Therefore, more definite conclusions can only be drawn after replication of the current
findings. Replications for different age groups and twin registries are especially important.
An important limitation of the US sample is its relative small size, and low participation of
male siblings. Replications with larger sibling sets, should also address sex differences in
more detail.
Another limitation is that the results of this study pertain to self-assessed health only.
Family resemblance could differ by health indicator. I am not aware of studies showing
differences in sibling (or twin) correlations for the various types of health indicators used
in social epidemiological research. Still, it seems reasonable to expect that such differences
exist and, hence, that one should be careful in generalizing the findings of this study.
The main strength of this study should also be stressed: the sibling design. This is a
unique design that allows us to take into account the total family effect. Of course the
drawback of the sibling design is that the family effect can not be separated into a genetic
and non-genetic part. However, it is important to note that a sibling design is much easier
to implement in large scale survey studies than a twin design. Given the substantial family
impact on self-assessed health, using sibling studies and twin data to increase our
knowledge on social health variations seems highly relevant. Currently, such data are only
available for a limited number of countries. There is a need for more and richer data sets
based on sibling and twin designs. Generating such data in more countries would not only
allow us to better test the general hypotheses addressed in this study, but it would also
contribute to our understanding of how social variations in health emerge in different types
of societies.
