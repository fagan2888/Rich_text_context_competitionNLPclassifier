Non-technical summary
Research Question
Unconventional monetary policy measures in the Eurozone seem to have led to a compres-
sion of bond yields that was stronger than the decrease of interest rates on newly issued
loans charged by banks in Germany. Furthermore, the volume of credit has increased in
relation to security holdings of German banks. This paper examines whether the change
in the relative price between bonds and credit resulted in a rebalancing of banks between
the securities and credit portfolio.
Contribution
This paper uses a fully anonymized dataset on banks' security holdings along with bank
balance sheets and data from monetary policy implementation. This granular data facil-
itates to answer the above question. In addition to the announcement and expectation
effects of unconventional monetary policy measures on bond yields, the analysis also ex-
ploits the reinvestment decisions that banks have to make when facing maturing securities.
Results
Results suggest that banks facing higher reductions of the average yield of their securities
portfolio increase their lending to non-financial firms and households more strongly in
response. The effect is particularly pronounced for banks that face more reinvestment
decision due to a high fraction of maturing assets. Additionally, banks more affected by
the unconventional monetary policy induced yield decline decrease their overall security
holdings, especially reducing the holdings of securities with the highest drop in yield. My
results shed light on the role of banks in the transmission of unconventional monetary
policy.

Unconventional Monetary Policy, Bank Lending, and
Security Holdings: The Yield-Induced Portfolio
Rebalancing Channel
Karol Paludkiewicz
Deutsche Bundesbank
Abstract
Exploiting a granular dataset of banks' security holdings I assess the impact of
unconventional monetary policy on bank lending and security holdings. Using a
difference-in-differences regression setup and holding the security composition of
each bank constant at its level in January 2014, well in advance of an anticipation
of the ECB's asset purchase program (APP), this paper provides evidence for the
presence of a yield-induced portfolio rebalancing channel: Banks experiencing a
higher average yield decline of their securities portfolio - induced by unconventional
expansionary monetary policy - increase their real sector lending more strongly
relative to other banks. The effect is stronger for banks facing many reinvestment
decisions. Moreover, I find that banks with a higher average yield decline reduce
their overall investments in securities more intensely, especially in those securities
that had larger valuation gains. These novel findings suggest that banks target a
specific yield level and shift their investments from the securities to the (higher-
yielding) credit portfolio. Making use of data on bank-specific TLTRO uptakes,
my results do not seem to be driven by alternative, liquidity-driven transmission
channels.

1 Introduction
After reaching the zero lower bound on interest rates many central banks like the Federal
Reserve (Fed), the Bank of England (BoE), the Bank of Japan (BoJ), and the European
Central Bank (ECB) embarked on so-called unconventional monetary policy measures
to stimulate their economies. These measures included new communication strategies,
negative interest rates, liquidity injections, and large-scale asset purchases (LSAP). These
measures are sizable. Since their introduction in the Eurozone, the balance sheet of the
ECB has increased from approximately 1.1 trillion EUR in January 2007 to 4.5 trillion
EUR in January 2018 and, as opposed to the Fed's balance sheet, is still growing. The
question that has been at the center of the debate among policymakers, investors, and
academics is whether these measures are effective in stimulating economic activity and
through which channels the transmission mechanism works. For instance, in the words
of Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, in January 2014: "The problem with
Quantitative Easing (QE) is it works in practice, but it doesn't work in theory."
I contribute to this debate by documenting how QE can affect economic activity via
the banking sector. I focus on a yield-induced portfolio rebalancing channel. According
to this channel, banks might react to a yield compression of longer term securities by
(a) reducing their bond holdings and (b) investing in alternative assets with a higher
expected return like loans to the real sector.1 To empirically test for the presence of this
channel, I consider Germany, which is the largest Eurozone economy. The Eurozone has
a bank-dominated financial system and banks are key for the transmission of monetary
policy. ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet (2016) argues that: "This crucial role of the
banking system explains why many of our monetary policy interventions during the crisis
were aimed at repairing the bank lending channel."
Economic theory yields different predictions of how QE can work. In their seminal
work Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) develop the famous irrelevance result of QE. Ac-
cordingly, in a standard New Keynesian model open market operations are ineffective at
the zero lower bound. Thus, unconventional monetary policy like asset purchases or the
change in the composition of the central bank balance sheet are not expected to have
direct real effects. Only a commitment about the future path of interest rates is a power-
ful way to stimulate the economy. Bhattarai, Eggertsson, and Gafarov (2015) show that
LSAP can act as a commitment device by generating a credible signal about the future
path of interest rates.
1A similar transmission channel is also analyzed by Albertazzi, Becker, and Boucinha (2018), who
primarily focus on a rebalancing motive by economic sectors into riskier newly issued securities (see also
Section 2 for a more detailed discussion).
1
In finance theory signaling is one channel through which QE can influence asset prices.
LSAP can cause a change of the expectations of the future path of short term interest rates,
thus, affecting the risk neutral component of bond yields (see e.g. Bauer and Rudebusch,
2014). Alternatively, under the assumption of imperfect substitutability between central
bank money and financial assets, investors faced by lower yields on securities purchased by
the central bank may turn to higher-yielding alternatives as corporate bonds or stocks.
This idea of a portfolio balance channel has been developed by early studies as Tobin
(1969) or Modigliani and Sutch (1966). More recently, Vayanos and Vila (2009) have
provided a formalization of the imperfect substitutability assumption: LSAP can affect
the term premium of long-term securities if investors have maturity-specific bond demands
(see also Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011). There exists a vast empirical
literature that analyzes the impact of QE on prices and finds that, by and large, asset
purchases positively affect asset prices and decrease bond yields.2
In my study, I take the result that QE affects bond yields negatively as given and
ask whether there are second-round effects that result in a portfolio reallocation of banks.
Banks might be faced with different incentives to rebalance their portfolio composition.
First, these incentives might stem from the additional liquidity emerging at banks. In
the spirit of Bagehot (1873) in crisis times the central bank can act as a lender of last
resort and provide liquidity directly to banks to prevent a credit contraction (see e.g.
Carpinelli and Crosignani, 2017). Alternatively, liquidity might be generated by the sale
of securities to the central bank either by the banks directly (see e.g. Rodnyansky and
Darmouni, 2017) or by the deponents of the bank (see e.g. Christensen and Krogstrup,
2017). Second, the impact that the numerous unconventional monetary policy measures
exert on yields (or prices) of securities held by banks might cause a rebalancing due to a
"stealth recapitalization" (Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2014). The increase in the value
of these securities can raise banks net worth and result in increased credit supply.
There is a growing body of empirical literature that examines the liquidity-driven re-
balancing motive by banks (see e.g. Kandrac and Schlusche, 2016; Butt, Churm, McMa-
hon, Morotz, and Schanz, 2014; Carpinelli and Crosignani, 2017; Andrade, Cahn, Fraisse,
and M´
esonnier, 2015). However, little work has been done on a rebalancing that is price-
or yield-induced.3 My goal is to contribute to this strand of literature.
2See e.g. Altavilla, Carboni, and Motto (2015) for the ECB's Asset Purchase Program, Krishnamurthy,
Nagel, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2018) on the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions and the Security
Markets Program, Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2013) for the Fed's Quantitative Easing, and
Joyce and Tong (2012) for the Bank of England's asset purchase program.

and MacKinlay (2016), and Tischer (2017).

My study is motivated by the following descriptive findings (see Figure 1). Throughout
2014 and 2015 there was a huge yield decline of all types of fixed-income securities in
the Eurozone that coincided with the expectation, announcement, and implementation
of various unconventional monetary policy measures (Panel a). This yield decline led
to a compression of bond yields that was stronger than the decrease of interest rates
on newly issued loans. Consequently, the spread between the average interest rate that
German banks charged on loans to the non-financial sector and the average yield of banks'
securities portfolio increased (Panel b). At the same time, the volume of credit supplied
by German banks increased in relation to the nominal value of securities held (Panel c).
These stylized facts give rise to the question whether the increased credit quantity was
driven by the change in the relative price between book credit and bonds. In other words,
did the expectation and announcement of unconventional monetary policy measures that
increased the relative return of book credit in terms of bond yields led to a rebalancing
from security holdings into credit?
Motivated by these stylized facts, I develop the following hypotheses to test for the
presence of a yield-induced portfolio rebalancing channel: (Hypothesis i) Banks facing
a larger compression of yields in their securities portfolio increase their book credit more
strongly because they target a specific yield level. (Hypothesis ii) Banks with a higher
average yield decline of their securities portfolio reduce their overall securities holdings
more intensely, especially selling those securities with the highest drop in yield and re-
alizing valuation gains. Thus, I analyze whether, against the background of a change in
relative price between book credit and bonds, there is a rebalancing between the securities
portfolio and the credit portfolio of banks that are more affected by the monetary policy
induced yield decline.
In order to empirically test for these hypotheses, the German security register proves
particularly useful. First, the granular information about the security-level holdings by
German banks allows exploiting the impact that the expectation and announcement of
various unconventional monetary policy measures, most importantly the Expanded Asset
Purchase Program (APP) of the European Central Bank (ECB), had on the yield of each
security. More specifically, following Albertazzi et al. (2018), I use the cross-sectional
heterogeneity in the composition of each banks' securities portfolio by calculating a bank
specific "yield-drop" variable. For each security that a bank holds in January 2014, one
year before the APP was announced by the ECB in January 2015 and well before investors
started to expect and price in this measure, I calculate by how much the specific yield
changed between January 2014 and June 2015. In other words, to rule out endogeneity
stemming from reverse causality I hold the composition of securities fix at its level in
3
January 2014 and take the impact of monetary policy on prices as given. Aggregating
this information on the bank level, this yield-drop variable is characterized by substantial
cross-sectional variation.
Second, the securities register includes information about the maturity date of the
securities held by banks. This provides another source of heterogeneity that I exploit for
identification of Hypothesis (i): From the point of view of January 2014 the amount of
securities that matures between January 2014 and June 2015 is predetermined.4 This
allows me to test whether the rebalancing arising from a high yield decline is stronger
for banks with many reinvestment decisions. In face of their compressed yields and the
freed up liquidity resulting from the maturing securities, those banks might increase their
credit granting more strongly to restore their targeted yield of their portfolio.
Third, when analyzing banks' securities holdings (i.e. Hypothesis (ii)) I exploit the
exhaustive detail of the security register for identification. I analyze the data at the
security-bank-month level. The inclusion of security*time fixed effects into my baseline
regressions allows me to compare the level of holdings in the same security and the same
month across banks more and less affected by unconventional monetary policy. Thus, I
can account for any observable or unobservable time-varying heterogeneity across securi-
ties, like liquidity, credit risk, and the level of issuance (credit demand by the securities'
issuers).
Armed with the two sources of heterogeneity, i.e. yield drop and maturing assets, I
use a difference-in-differences estimation technique and find significant and sizable effects
on credit supply for banks with a higher drop in yields as compared to their counterparts.
On average, banks with a decline in yield of one standard deviation increase the quantity
of newly issued loans to the real sector by 4.8% between 2013 and 2015, i.e. over a
two year period surrounding the monetary policy induced yield decline and reduce their
overall holdings of securities by 5.1%. I find that the effect of credit supply is particularly
pronounced for banks with many maturing assets, i.e. banks facing many reinvestment
decisions. Moreover, I find that banks with a higher yield decline reduce their holdings
of securities characterized by the largest valuation gains (i.e. with the largest drop in
yield) more strongly, thus, realizing the gains from these security holdings. The results
suggest that banks target a specific yield level and, facing an average yield decline of their
securities portfolio, actively rebalance towards higher-yielding book credit.
4Among others, the maturity structure has been exploited for identification by Almeida, Campello,
Laranjeira, and Weisbenner (2012) to study the real effects of the 2007 crisis or by Tischer (2017), who
exploits banks' maturity structure to identify the effect of QE on lending using a similar dataset.
4
Instead of increasing their book loans, banks more affected by monetary policy could
seek to increase their investments in higher-yielding securities. Following Albertazzi et al.
(2018), I investigate this alternative potential rebalancing opportunity but do not find
evidence in favor of it. I follow a similar argumentation as Albertazzi et al. (2018) and
argue that yields were already so compressed in Germany that, against the background
of a home-bias, a rebalancing into securities with a relatively high yield would make
it necessary to heavily change the portfolio composition. This highlights the economic
plausibility of my findings: given the relative price change between securities and book
credit banks favor a rebalancing towards lending.
I do not find robust evidence that the above effects are more pronounced for weakly
capitalized banks. One potential explanation might be that, outside crisis times, equity
does not constitute a constraint for comparatively well-capitalized German banks. This
confirms the findings of Timmer (2018), who shows that, outside crisis times, the securities
trading behavior of banks does not depend on their equity ratio.
There are three potential concerns for identification that I address in the following
way: First, the treatment intensity given by the monetary policy induced yield decline
could potentially be correlated with other events that simultaneously affect a bank's loan
issuance through other channels. Between September 2014 and March 2017 the Targeted
Longer Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) were implemented in the Eurozone with
the aim of fostering credit supply. They offer central bank refinancing at favorable condi-
tions, which are tied to a bank's net credit supply. Using detailed proprietary data on the
bank-specific TLTRO uptakes, I show that there is no differential drawing on this specific
credit facility between banks more and less affected by the treatment. Thus, the bank-
specific yield decline is not simply proxying for the TLTRO uptakes and is not capturing
a liquidity-driven rather than a yield-induced rebalancing motive.5
Second, an important prerequisite for my estimates to be attributable to the monetary
policy induced yield decline is that the treatment intensity (i.e. by how much the average
yield of a bank's securities portfolio declined) is unrelated to other bank characteristics
that might influence the lending behavior. To address this issue, I carefully adjust the data
by means of a matching approach in addition to controlling for a number of covariates.
I effectively select a control group that has similar characteristics as the treated banks.
This weighting approach takes care of the parallel trend assumption.
5Note that I am allowing the TLTROs to affect a banks credit supply through their overall effect on
yields but I want to rule out that my treatment intensity is picking up the TLTROs' effect on banks'
credit granting through liquidity channels.
5
The third concern is that of distinguishing between supply and demand effects, which
are mostly unobserved. The portfolio rebalancing channel analyzed in this paper is a
notion involving a supply-driven credit increase. As my credit data is on a bank level,
I follow the bank lending channel literature (see e.g. Kashyap and Stein, 1995; Kishan
and Opiela, 2000; Worms, 2001) when analyzing Hypothesis (i). Accordingly, I focus
on groups of banks for which economically the supply driven effect should be stronger.
I robustly find that the yield-induced rebalancing motive towards more credit granting
is particularly pronounced for banks facing many reinvestment decisions. This result
reinforces the notion of a supply-driven credit expansion.
Various robustness checks support the presence of my findings. Most importantly,
a falsification test finds no significant differences in lending behavior between 2011 and
2013 among banks with diverse valuation gains, i.e. in a period prior to the onset of the
treatment. Thus, the observed change in lending outcomes is most likely attributable
to the monetary policy induced yield drop, as opposed to an alternative bank-specific
unobservable force.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes how this paper fits into
the existing literature. Section 3 presents the data used for the analysis and the empirical
design. Section 4 reports the empirical results and Section 5 concludes.
2 Related Literature
My paper contributes to the growing literature that assesses the effectiveness of unconven-
tional monetary policy at the bank level. Many papers in this group study liquidity-driven
channels. Papers like Carpinelli and Crosignani (2017), Garcia-Posada and Marchetti
(2016) or Andrade et al. (2015) analyze the effect of the 3-year Longer Term Refinancing
Operations (3y-LTROs) that were implemented in the Eurozone in 2011 and 2012 in the
wake of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis to prevent a funding squeeze of the banking
sector. Butt et al. (2014) focus on banks' deposits as the key pass-through variable of
assets sales by the banks' deponents (e.g. institutional investors etc.). They show that the
Bank of England's asset purchases had no impact on bank lending through this channel.
Kandrac and Schlusche (2016) test for the existence of a reserve-induced portfolio rebal-
ancing channel, where the sale of securities increases banks reserves, thus, disturbing the
banks' optimal balance sheet composition. The authors exploit a regulatory change in the
US that influenced the reserve distribution and find that banks increase their lending and
risk-taking activity to reinstall the optimal asset and liability structure. Koetter, Podlich,
and Wedow (2017) analyze the effect that the Eurosystem's Securities Markets Program
6
(SMP) had on competition in the banking market. The authors exploit the heterogeneity
in bank-level holdings of securities that were purchased under the SMP and find positive
effects on loan and deposit market shares. Another paper studying the effect of QE on
lending is Chakraborty et al. (2016). They analyze MBS and tresury purchases by the Fed
and find a crowding out of commercial lending in favor of mortgage origination following
MBS sales. In addition, they find that firms' borrowing from MBS selling banks reduce
their investments.
Another paper close to this one is Rodnyansky and Darmouni (2017). The authors
study the effect that the three rounds of QE in the US had on lending. They mainly
focus on mortgage lending and exploit the heterogeneity in the MBS holdings of banks.
In contrast to their approach, I do not consider banks' holdings of a particular asset class
to define the treatment status but rather exploit the heterogeneity in the impact that
unconventional monetary policy had on yields of all fixed-income securities that banks
hold in their own accounts. Furthermore, they do not study banks security holdings
behavior.6
Overall, my contribution consists of taking the result that asset purchases affect bond
yields negatively as given and asking whether banks that face stronger yield reductions
have larger incentives to (a) reduce their securities holdings and (b) increase bank lending.
The two closest papers to my analysis are Albertazzi et al. (2018) and Tischer (2017).
Albertazzi et al. (2018) also study the yield-induced rebalancing motive using the hetero-
geneity in the APP induced yield decline. However, they mainly focus on different sectors
(e.g. households, firms, pension funds, money market funds, banks etc.) and analyze
whether those sectors have a rebalancing motive into newly issued riskier securities. They
also give suggestive evidence in favor of a yield-induced rebalancing motive of banks from
countries less affected by the sovereign debt crisis by studying the credit granting behav-
ior of the largest 25 European institutions. As acknowledged by the authors "(...) the
small number of banks represents a constraint for the econometric analysis (...)." Further,
they do not analyze the security holding behavior of these banks as outcome variable.
In contrast, my study explicitly focuses on banks and tests for the hypotheses developed
above, which are motivated by the stylized fact that the relative price between credit and
securities has changed in Germany. As opposed to Albertazzi et al. (2018) I find that
6Further papers studying the effects of unconventional monetary policy include: Grosse-Rueschkamp,
Steffen, and Streitz (2017), Arce, Gimeno, and Mayordomo (2017), and Abidi, Miquel Flores, and Eterovic
(2017) all analyze the effects of the ECB's Corporate Bond Purchase Program. Acharya, Eisert, Eufin-
ger, and Hirsch (2017), and Ferrando, Popov, and Udell (2016) study the announcement effects of the
ECB's Outright Monetary Transaction Program. Eser and Schwaab (2016) study the transmission of
the Securities Markets Program (SMP) on bond yields. Heider, Saidi, and Schepens (2017) analyze the
transmission of negative policy rates via banks.
7
banks with greater yield declines reduce their security holdings (besides increasing their
credit granting). Additionally, I intend to shed more light on the underlying bank-specific
mechanisms as well as heterogeneities of the yield-induced portfolio rebalancing chan-
nel. Furthermore, by making use of data from monetary policy operations, in particular
bank-specific TLTRO-uptakes, I can control for alternative, liquidity-driven transmission
channels.
Tischer (2017) also analyzes the effect of QE on bank lending supply in Germany. To
this end, he exploits the maturity structure of banks' bond holdings and finds that more
exposed banks increase their loan growth during QE relative to other banks. This result
supports my main finding that banks with stronger yield compressions increase assets
with a higher expected return, i.e. book credit, and reduce their security holdings at the
same time. In addition, it is consistent with the finding in this paper that the rebalancing
motive is stronger for banks with many maturing assets that simultaneously have a strong
decline of yields in their securities portfolio. In contrast to Tischer (2017), who primarily
focuses on maturing securities for identification, my main source of heterogeneity stems
from the intensity of the average yield decline of a bank's securities portfolio. Furthermore,
I analyze the security holdings decision of banks on a security-level as outcome variable,
which allows for a rich identification. Understanding the security holdings behavior of
banks affected by unconventional monetary policy is a key contribution of this paper.
Additionally, using bank-specific TLTRO uptakes allows me to directly control for this
potentially contaminating unconventional monetary policy instrument without the need
of using proxy variables for this purpose.
Another related paper to my study is Peydr´
o, Polo, and Sette (2017). They also
analyze banks investment behavior due to monetary policy using credit and securities
register data from Italy. They find that in crisis times less capitalized banks prefer buying
securities rather than increasing credit supply in reaction to a softer monetary policy.
One key difference to my paper is the monetary policy indicator that they examine.
They mainly focus on the central bank balance sheet, which incorporates the actually
implemented monetary policy measures. In contrast, I use the impact that the anticipation
and announcement of unconventional monetary policy had on yields. Additionally, Peydr´
o
et al. (2017) study crisis and non-crisis times, whereas I focus on a time period that spans
the implementation of the APP and the TLTROs.
Another group of papers studies the effects of asset purchases on macroeconomic
variables using VAR models. Their main focus are the effects of QE on output and
prices. Weale and Wieladek (2016) rely on Bayesian inference and use a combination of
zero and sign restrictions to identify an asset purchase announcement shock. They find
8
a positive effect on output and prices for the US and UK. A similar approach is taken
by Gambacorta, Hofmann, and Peersman (2014), who estimate a Panel VAR for eight
advanced economies and focus on the aggregated central bank balance sheet as the main
policy variable. Lewis and Roth (2017) also estimate a Bayesian VAR and identify an
asset purchase shock by using different aggregated items from the ECB's balance sheet.
The authors find a positive effect of asset purchases on output for both the Eurozone
and Germany. They also analyze the response of bank lending to firms following the
asset purchase shock and find no reaction of this variable in the German economy. All
those papers have the advantage that the exploitation of the time series variation enables
them to study the transitional dynamics of asset purchases. However, it is hard to draw
conclusions about the heterogeneous reaction of various agents to the asset purchase shock.
Furthermore, most of these papers use aggregate central bank balance sheet items that
include the actually purchased amounts of securities or they construct an asset purchase
announcement series. Therefore, they do not fully incorporate the effects stemming from
the anticipation of asset purchase programs by investors. Especially in the case of the
Eurozone there is evidence that the APP has been anticipated by market participants,
thus, affecting prices positively well in advance of the actual implementation. I explicitly
incorporate this anticipated reaction in bond prices in my analysis.
My paper also relates to the literature analyzing the bank lending (Bernanke and
Blinder, 1988; Bernanke and Blinder, 1992) and risk taking channels (Borio and Zhu,
2008; Adrian and Shin, 2011) of monetary policy during conventional times. In their
seminal paper, Kashyap and Stein (1995) exploit bank-level data and identify the bank
lending channel by showing that small banks, i.e. banks facing larger frictions and having
difficulties in saturating their funding needs, contract their lending activity stronger after a
monetary policy tightening. In a similar vein, Kishan and Opiela (2000) and Gambacorta
and Mistrulli (2004) focus on weakly capitalized banks instead of the banks' size. More
recent contributions analyze the bank lending and risk taking channel using loan level data
(Jim´
enez, Ongena, Peydr´
o, and Saurina, 2012; Jim´
enez, Ongena, Peydr´
o, and Saurina,
2014).
This paper also contributes to the literature studying security holdings of banks and
institutional investors at the security-level. Abbassi, Iyer, Peydr´
o, and Tous (2016) also
use the German securities register in conjunction with lending data. However, they do
not study monetary policy, but are interested in securities trading by banks with trading
expertise in the crisis. Timmer (2018) studies security trading of institutional investors.
Contrary to my results, Timmer (2018) finds that banks respond pro-cyclically to price
changes, i.e. they sell securities when prices are falling. In contrast to Timmer (2018),
9
I focus on banks with large credit and securities portfolios and focus on a time period
characterized by a huge decline of the general yield level induced by monetary policy.7

I focus on Germany to analyze the yield-induced portfolio rebalancing channel. Ger-
many's financial system is bank-dominated and the largest in the EMU making it an
ideal candidate to study the effects of unconventional monetary policy on bank lending
and security holdings. Further, the availability and combination of the securities register
with balance-sheet information and data from monetary policy implementation provides
a comprehensive view on banks' balance sheets. In this section, I first describe the data
used in this paper. Then, I turn to the stylized facts about the credit and securities
market in Germany during the time period of investigation, i.e. from January 2013 un-
til December 2015, which provide descriptive evidence for the potential presence of a
yield-induced rebalancing channel. Finally, I describe the identification strategy and the
empirical setup.
3.1 Data
To construct the dataset used for the empirical analysis I use the German securities
register, the balance sheet statistics, the interest rate statistics, and the income state-
ment statistics of German banks compiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank. This dataset is
augmented with data on the refinancing operations of German monetary policy counter-
parties. The baseline time period under consideration is January 2013 until December
2015.
The securities register includes the nominal amounts of the security holdings of each
German bank on a security level for the end of each month. I merge this dataset with
the centralized securities data base to obtain additional security specific information as
the yield, price, maturity date, security type, and issuer sector. I complement this data
with monthly bank-level balance sheet information like total assets, equity capital, central
bank reserves, saving deposits, and yearly income statement items such as net profits and
net interest received. The data on monetary policy refinancing operations includes the
bank-specific TLTRO-uptakes.
7Timmer (2018) analyzes the time period 2005 Q4 - 2014 Q4 and focuses on all German banks.
10
My bank-level loan data comes from the interest rate statistics, composed of a sample
of above 200 deposit taking and loan granting credit institutions. The sample is selected
with a stratified sampling procedure according to the categories of banks, regional criteria,
and size. In terms of coverage around 70% of the total German loan business is captured
by this dataset.8 Thus, the sample includes German banks with a strong focus on credit
granting. The unique feature of the MFI interest rate statistics is that, along with the
interest rates on loans, it includes the monthly volumes of new business at the end of each
month for loans to households and non-financial corporations.
As I focus on newly issued loans, my final sample after merging the loan data with
the above datasets consists of 204 banks. This sample is interesting due to the following
reasons: First, those are the banks most active in credit granting and, therefore, they
are particularly important for the transmission of those unconventional monetary policy
measures, which target an expansion of credit. Second, as described in the following
section, a difference-in-differences regression setup is used and the treatment intensity in
the average yield drop of a bank is exploited for identification. This requires to make sure
that the banks from the control group are similar in terms of observable and unobservable
characteristics to the treated banks. As described in the following section, I deal with
the observable characteristics by means of a matching procedure. However, it is more
challenging to handle unobservable characteristics. Choosing banks with a similar business
model, i.e. a strong focus on credit granting, can help in this respect.
3.2 Stylized Facts
One prerequisite for the presence of the yield-induced portfolio rebalancing channel is
that of a yield decline that can be attributed to unconventional monetary policy. Panel a
of Figure 1 shows the evolution of 10-year government bond yields for selected Eurozone
countries. Between January 2014 and June 2015 yields of government securities declined
substantially. The yield decline is not specific to government securities but can also
be observed among other fixed-income securities, like corporate or covered bonds. Along
with the government bond yields the graph shows various unconventional monetary policy
measures that are indicated by vertical lines. In June 2014 the deposit facility rate was
lowered by 10 basis points into negative territory, i.e. to -0.10%. In September 2014 the
first tender of the first TLTRO-series was implemented, in January 2015 the APP was
announced, and in March 2015 the APP was implemented. It is challenging to quantify
how much of the yield decline between January 2014 and June 2015 was due to the specific

11
unconventional measures, especially because throughout 2014 there was a huge discussion
among investors whether the ECB will announce an asset purchase program. Appendix
A.1 contains a compilation of newsletter articles that highlight the investors' speculation
throughout the year 2014. As I want to capture this anticipation effects, in this paper,
I take the impact of monetary policy on asset prices as given by calculating the drop in
yields between January 2014 and June 2015.
A further indication for the presence of a yield-induced rebalancing motive towards
more credit supply is that credit granting becomes more attractive relative to security
investments. Panel b of Figure 1 illustrates the spread between the average interest rate
that German banks charge on loans to the non-financial sector and the average yield of
banks' securities portfolios. This figure is increasing over time, primarily driven by a
stronger decline of the securities' yields as compared to the fall in interest rates on loans.
This spread gives rise to the presence of a potential rebalancing motive towards more
lending. In other words, panel b shows the change in the relative return of bank loans
in terms of bond yields, which is a prerequisite for the existence of a rebalancing motive,
whereby the compression of yields on securities held by banks induces them to invest in
assets with a higher expected return, i.e. loans.9
The next piece of evidence is provided by panel c of Figure 1, which depicts the
evolution of the ratio of the average credit volume extended to the non-financial private
sector in the numerator and the average nominal value of securities held by all German
banks in the denominator. Similarly, also this ratio is increasing over time.
Figure 1 provides first descriptive evidence in favor of a yield-induced portfolio rebal-
ancing channel. This needs to be formally tested at the bank level to gauge the causal
effect of unconventional monetary policy on bank lending and securities holding behavior.
3.3 Empirical Strategy
The identification strategy exploits differences in banks' exposure of their securities port-
folio to unconventional monetary policy measures. To this end, I construct a bank-level
variable indicating by how much the average yield of the securities portfolio dropped be-
tween 2014:M1 and 2015:M6 in the following way. I consider fixed-income securities as
they account for more than 95% of all securities holdings of German banks. Further-
more, debt securities are most comparable in their structure to bank loan contracts, thus,
9One potential criticism of using this spread might be that the series increases because banks take
on more risk in the credit portfolio. Tischer (2017) calculates a risk-adjusted spread based on loans
underlying Asset Backed Securities in Germany for a similar time period and shows that the evolution
of the risk-adjusted spread is similar to the unadjusted spread.
12
a rebalancing motive into more loan supply should be most pronounced for this asset
class. For each security I calculate by how much its yield dropped between 2014:M1 and
2015:M6. I exclude all securities that mature in this time window to rule out that my
final variable picks up any mechanical change in yield stemming from a possible pull-to-
par effect10. Finally, I weight each security by its nominal amount. I label the resulting
variable "MP", which denotes monetary policy.
Holding the composition of securities fixed at its level in January 2014, well before
investors started to anticipate the asset purchase program,11 I can rule out any endo-
geneity stemming from reverse causality. Additionally, by calculating the drop in yield
between 2014:M1 and 2015:M6 irrespectively of whether the security is actually still held
in 2015:M6 helps me to prevent endogeneity arising from the decision of banks to sell a
security due to unconventional monetary policy. The choice of June 2015 as the end date
of the window for the yield decline calculation is driven by the following trade off decision.
First, enlarging the window, e.g. choosing 2015:M12 as the end date, would result in a
smaller fraction of securities that are actually still held at the end date. Second, picking
a smaller window, e.g. 2014:M12 as the end date, would result in capturing a smaller
amount of unconventional monetary policy measures.12 Nevertheless, in Section 4.3 I
show that results are robust to choosing 2014:M12 as the end date of the window for the
yield decline calculation.
Although yields might have declined due to other reasons than unconventional mon-
etary policy, I follow Albertazzi et al. (2018) and argue that both anecdotal evidence
(see Appendix A.1) and the empirical literature (e.g. Altavilla et al., 2015) demonstrate
that the announcement and anticipation of the APP by financial market participants was
the most important driver of asset prices in the Eurozone in the period examined in this
paper.13
Summary Statistics Table 1 shows the summary statistics of all variables used in the
empirical analysis. Most importantly, the MP variable is characterized by substantial
cross-sectional variation. While the securities portfolio of the lower quartile bank faced
a decline of 0.47 percentage points, the average yield drop of the upper quartile bank
10Pull-to-par describes that the bonds price will gradually converge to par when maturity approaches.
11To my knowledge, the first newsletter article that mentions speculations about an asset purchase
program was published in March 2014 (see Appendix A.1).
12The APP was implemented in March 2015. I choose June 2015 to also capture some of the effects of
the actual implementation of the APP on yields.
13The anticipation effect on yields of securities makes it challenging to quantify how much of the overall
yield decline was due to monetary policy. Considering only securities that were eligible under the APP
would introduce an endogeneity concern as the eligible assets were determined on the announcement date
of the APP, which was in January 2015, i.e. one year after January 2014.
13
was 0.79 percentage points. The ratio of maturing securities to total assets does also
display considerable cross-sectional variation: the lower quartile bank has securities that
mature between 2014:M1 and 2015:M6 accounting for 1.5% of the total balance sheet,
while this figure amounts to 4.7% for the upper quartile bank. Interestingly, the median
bank holds approximately 17% of their total assets in fixed income securities and for the
lower quartile bank this figure is at approximately 10%. This illustrates that the banks
in my sample are characterized by a fairly large fraction of fixed-income securities on the
asset side of their balance sheet.
Table 2 displays additional descriptive statistics. Given the total securities holdings
in 2014:M1 the table shows that 62% of these securities are still held in 2015:M6, whereas
22.5% are maturing and 15.5% are sold in between. It is crucial to emphasize that
banks would not have a rebalancing motive if they held all assets until maturity as their
eventual yield would be determined at the moment of the security's purchase in this
case. However, as Table 2 shows, banks are selling a substantial fraction of their overall
securities. Additionally, they face reinvestment decisions whenever a security matures.
Thus, it is an empirical question whether they continually target a specific yield level and
whether the change in relative price between book credit and securities drives their credit
granting and their security holdings decision.
Credit Analysis To assess the yield-induced impact of unconventional monetary policy
on bank lending, i.e. Hypothesis (i), I employ a difference-in-differences (DID) approach
and run the following bank-level regression (Baseline Model 1):
Log(loans)i
= 0
+ 1
 MPi
+ Xi
2
+ Banktype FE + ui
, (1)
where i denotes a bank. The dependent variable Log(loans)i
is the change in the
logarithm of newly issued loans around the yield decline. To avoid problems of serial
correlation, I follow Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004) and collapse the monthly
observations in pre (2013:M1-2013M12) and post (2015:M1-2015:M12) event averages.
Thus, I have one observation for each bank. The alternative to collapsing the data is
twoway-clustering of the standard errors (see below). The key variable of interest is MPi
.
Control variables are denoted by Xi
. Following the bank lending literature (Kashyap
and Stein, 2000) Xi
includes the logarithm of total assets, the equity to assets ratio,
and the return on assets. I include the central bank reserves to assets ratio to control
for any potential sales of securities by the bank to the central bank in the context of
the APP and to control for a possible reserve-induced transmission channel (Kandrac
and Schlusche, 2016). The deposit to assets ratio controls for another liquidity-driven
14
transmission channel operating through deposits (Butt et al., 2014). I further include an
interbank lending to assets ratio to control for the funding situation of the bank and the
net interest margin to control for the profitability and the importance of credit business.
Additionally, banktype fixed effects (i.e. savings banks, cooperative banks, Landesbanks,
big commercial banks, regional banks) are included in the regressions. In this collapsed
regression Model 1 all control variables are measured before the yield decline in December
2013. Finally, ui
is an error term. The coefficient 1
measures the treatment effect of the
monetary policy induced yield decline.
As an alternative specification to Model 1, I estimate the following panel equation
(Model 2):
Log(loans)i,t
= i
+ t
+ 1
(MPi
 POSTt
) + Xi,t
2
+ ui,t
, (2)
where i
are bank fixed effects and control for bank-specific time invariant unobserved
characteristics. t
denote time fixed effects and control for different economy wide de-
velopments that change over time.14 Note that a country-wide change of loan demand
is absorbed by the time fixed effects. The dependent variable Log(loans)i,t
is the log-
arithm of newly issued loans and POSTt
is a dummy variable that takes the value of
one after 2015:M1. The model is estimated with monthly data for the period 2013:M1
until 2015:M12. Time-varying control variables are denoted by Xi,t
and include the same
variables as above. I follow Bertrand et al. (2004) and avoid problems of serial corre-
lation of the error term by twoway clustering the standard errors at the bank and time
level (Petersen, 2009) instead of collapsing the data as in Model 1. The key variable of
interest is the interaction term MPi
 POSTt
, as I am interested in the differential effect
of banks with a high decline in yields versus banks with a low yield decline comparing
the pre-MP period (2013:M1-2013:M12) relative to the period after the MP induced yield
decline (2015:M1-2015:M12). In other words, the coefficient 1
measures the treatment
effect of the monetary policy induced yield decline.
Securities Analysis To analyze whether banks reduce their security holdings and re-
alize the valuation gains stemming from unconventional monetary policy, i.e. Hypothesis
14Among others, the time fixed effects control for conventional monetary policy, i.e. the main refinancing
(MRO) rate of the Eurosystem, as well as economy wide shock.
15
(ii), I estimate the following econometric model at the security-bank-month level:
Log(security holdings)j,i,t
= 1
(MPi
 POSTt
 High-yield-declinej
)
+ 2
(MPi
 POSTt
)
+ 3
(POSTt
 High-yield-declinej
)
+ 4
(MPi
 High-yield-declinej
)
+ Xi,t
5
+ j,t
+ i,t
+ uj,i,t
, (3)
where the dependent variable is the logarithm of nominal holdings of security j by bank
i at month t. Xi,t
includes the bank-specifiy, time-varying control variables from above.
POSTt
is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 after 2015:M1. High-yield-declinej
is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if a security has a high drop in yield
between 2014:M1 and 2015:M6, i.e. when the security is above the 90th percentile of all
securities. The model is estimated for the period 2013:M1 until 2015:M12.
For identification, in the strongest specification, I include security*time fixed effects
to control for any security-specific time varying observable or unobservable characteristics
(e.g. liquidity, risk, issuance amount) and bank*time fixed effects to control for any bank-
specific time varying observable or unobservable characteristics. In some regressions I am
interested in the interaction between MPi
and POSTt
. I include security, bank, and
time fixed effects, or security*time fixed effects along with bank fixed effects and time-
varying, bank-specific control variables into the regression in this case as otherwise the
interaction term would be absorbed by the bank*time fixed effects. I cluster standard
errors at the bank, security, and time level.15 The estimated coefficient 2
then measures
the overall securities holdings of banks more versus banks less affected before versus
after the monetary policy induced yield decline. The estimated coefficient 1
measures
the differential securities holdings of securities with a high decline in yield by banks
more versus banks less affected by monetary policy before and after the unconventional
monetary policy driven yield decline.
Parallel trend assumption The key identifying assumption is that the treatment
intensity is unrelated to other bank characteristics that might influence a bank's lending
behavior. In other words, the trends related to loan granting need to be the same among
more and less treated banks before the treatment happens. Figure 2 provides a first test
of this assumption. The sample is divided into high- and low-yield-drop banks according
to the median of the MP variable. Before January 2014 the evolution of new loans looks

16
comparable. In line with the hypothesis of the paper, starting in the middle of 2014 banks
more affected by the monetary policy induced yield decline increase their new loans much
stronger than less affected banks. This development continues throughout 2015.
In a next step, I assess whether the MP variable can be predicted by various (pre-
shock) bank-level characteristics. Column 1 of Table 3 shows the results of a probit
regression of the MP dummy on these characteristics. No variable has explanatory power
for the treatment status and also the p-value of the 2 test of overall model fit shows that
one cannot reject the null hypothesis that all coefficient estimates are zero. Nevertheless,
as the p-value is close to the 10% significance level and given the pre-shock evolution of
newly issued credit shown in Figure 2, in a careful attempt to ensure that my results
are not biased by the potentially endogenous determination of securities holdings (with
a high yield-drop), I perform a nearest-neighbor propensity score weighting approach. In
a first step, I divide my sample according to the median of the MP variable and regress
the resulting treatment status on the pre-shock bank-level characteristics. The propensity
scores (predicted values) of this probit regression are used in a nearest neighbor propensity
score matching approach with replacement. For each bank out of the group with a high
yield drop a control unit is selected out of the "low-yield-drop" group that gives the best
match according to the propensity score. In a second step, I use the resulting weights
that are calculated based on the frequency of a match in my regressions. This way I
discard the observations that are very dissimilar to the "treated" banks by giving them
a low weight. Column 2 of Table 3 displays the results of the probit regression with the
matched sample. Compared to column 1, the p-value of the 2 test of overall model fit
increases to 0.726, which indicates the satisfactory performance of the weighting exercise.
I report results based on this matched sample in columns 2 and 4 of Table 4.
4 Results
4.1 Credit Analysis
Table 4 reports the main estimation results for the credit regressions to test Hypothesis (i).
Columns 1 and 2 show the results of the collapsed baseline model 1, where the dependent
variable is the change of the logarithm of newly issued loans of bank i between the pre event
average (2013:M1-2013:M12) and the post event average (2015:M1-2015:M12). Bank-type
fixed effects are included. The coefficient estimate of the MP variable is statistically
significant at the 1% significance level. The positive sign is in line with the presence of
a yield-induced rebalancing motive: Banks experiencing a higher average yield decline of
17
their securities portfolio induced by expansionary unconventional monetary policy increase
their real sector lending more strongly in response. To illustrate the economic impact
of the effect lets consider the coefficient of the MP variable in column 1, which shows
the results in a sample without propensity score weighting. A bank with a one standard
deviation decrease of the average yield (0.41) of its securities portfolio increases the average
newly issued loans by 8.8% between 2013 and 2015 as compared to a bank without such
decrease in yield.
In column 2, I report the results with the weighted sample based on the propensity
score matching procedure described above. The coefficient in colum 2 is only slightly
smaller as compared to the unmatched sample. This indicates that it is unlikely that my
results in the unmatched sample in column 1 are biased by the potentially endogenous
determination of security holdings (with a high yield-drop).
Next, in columns 3 and 4, I present results for model 2, where instead of taking pre
and post event averages, the regression is performed using monthly observations with
standard errors clustered at the bank and time level. As the dependent variable is the
natural logarithm of newly issued loans, the coefficient estimate in column 3 suggests that
banks with a decrease of the average yield in their securities portfolio by one standard
deviation (0.41) on average increase their newly issued loans by 4.8% between 2013 and
2015 as compared to banks without such decrease in yields. Compared to model 1,
the lower magnitude of the effect might be driven by the control variables. Whereas
in model 1 the bank-specific control variables are measured before the monetary policy
induced yield decline (2013:M12), model 2 includes the time varying values. As before, the
coefficient estimate is only slightly changed when using the weighted sample (see column
4). Therefore, for the ease of exposition, in all subsequent regressions I report the results
with the unweighted sample.
Heterogeneities: Maturing Assets The main hypothesis analyzed in this paper is
that banks that face a stronger yield compression rebalance their portfolio towards al-
ternative assets with a higher expected return. This effect should be particularly strong
for banks that hold many maturing securities. Once a security matures and additional
liquidity is released, the bank has to make a reinvestment decision. Hence, the yield-
induced portfolio rebalancing effect towards loans to non-financial companies and house-
holds should be particularly strong for banks with many maturing assets that simulta-
neously have a strong decline of yields in their securities portfolio. These banks might
increase their credit granting more strongly to restore their targeted yield of their securi-
ties portfolio.
18
In Table 5, I test for this incentive by exploiting the heterogeneity given by the amount
of securities that mature between 2014:M1 and 2015:M6 for identification.16 In column 2 I
include the maturing-assets-ratio along with an interaction term between MP variable and
the maturing-assets-ratio into the regression model 1. I precede equivalently in column 4
for model 2. As expected, in both cases the interaction term is positive and statistically
significant. This means that the treatment effect is larger for banks with a higher maturing
assets to total assets ratio. In both models the coefficient estimates of the MP variable
remain positive and significant. The marginal effect of the MP variable depending on
the maturing-assets-ratio is depicted in Figure 3. Thus, the results seem to confirm
the above conjecture that banks that face reinvestment decisions due to many maturing
securities increase their (higher yielding) credit granting when they are more heavily
affected by the monetary policy induced yield decline. These findings seem to be in line
with banks targeting a specific yield level of their total assets. Furthermore, these findings
are consistent with the results in Tischer (2017).
Heterogeneities: Equity Now, I turn my attention to analyzing whether the effect of
unconventional monetary policy is stronger for weakly capitalized banks. In the presence
of funding constraints the monetary policy induced valuation gains on securities held
by banks can potentially improve the banks' capital position and, consequently, their
credit-bearing capacity. Table 6 tests for this mechanism. The regression setup remains
unchanged compared to above with the exception that an interaction term between the
MP variable and the equity-ratio is included into the regression. Intuitively, worse cap-
italized banks should profit more by the valuation gains as opposed to well capitalized
banks because they face more frictions: they are more likely constrained by their capital
position and they have more problems in attracting funds. Hence, if this form of equity
mechanism is at work one would expect a stronger effect of the MP variable on bank
lending behavior for banks with a lower equity to assets ratio. The coefficient estimates
of the interaction term between the MP variable and the equity ratio is not statistically
different from zero in neither model. Thus, I do not find evidence for the above conjecture.
Heterogeneities: Sectors So far, I have focused on the total lending to the private
non-financial sector. An interesting question is which sectors receive the additionally
issued loans. Table 7 contains the results of regressions with the dependent variable
split into loans to non-financial corporations (columns 1 and 3) and loans to households
(columns 2 and 4). The results do not show any difference in loan granting to any of the
16The maturing-assets-ratio is calculated based on the securities portfolio in 2014:M1.
19
two sectors. Accordingly, both, the non-financial corporations and the household sector
face higher loan granting.
Contaminating Events One potential concern regarding the identification strategy
implemented in this paper is that one of the unconventional monetary policy measures
that potentially affects banks through other non yield-induced channels might be both cor-
related with the MP variable and linked to banks' lending behavior. One such measure are
the Targeted Longer Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs), which were implemented
between December 2014 and March 2017, i.e. during most of the time period analyzed
in this paper. The main aim of the TLTROs was to provide banks with liquidity under
favorable conditions to foster credit supply. These refinancing operations have a maturity
of up to 4 years. The amount that a bank is allowed to draw in the numerous tender
operations and the interest rate it has to pay for the central bank money are linked to
the banks' newly issued loans.
In an initial attempt to eye-ball whether the potential contamination of the TLTROs
might bias my results, in panel a of Figure 4 I use data on bank-specific TLTRO uptakes to
shows the average TLTRO uptake as a fraction of total assets of the two groups of banks
divided according to the median of the MP variable. The evolution of the TLTRO-ratio
is mostly parallel for the two groups, which is a first indication that banks with a higher
yield drop do not use the TLTROs more extensively than banks with a lower yield drop.
Next, in Table 8 I run regressions, where I explicitly control for the bank specific TLTRO
uptakes. 17 All previous results hold. Thus, the results suggest that the monetary policy
induced yield decline is not simply proxying for TLTRO uptakes. This indicates that my
results do not seem to be driven by alternative liquidity-driven transmission channels but
are rather capturing yield-induced rebalancing motives.
Apart from the TLTROs, further potentially contaminating events are the actual
purchases of securities by the central banks of the Eurosystem in the context of the APP.
When a bank sells eligible securities on behalf of their deponents, the bank's total central
bank reserves on its asset side as well as its saving deposits on its liability side might
increase. This increase might disturb the bank's optimal balance sheet composition. In
order to reinstall the original composition, banks might seek to increase their loan supply.
This argument has been made by Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and has recently been
17I use the empirical specification of model 2 in this case because model 1 includes control variables
measured in 2013:M12 and the TLTROs were initiated in late 2014. An alternative to reporting the
results with the additional control variable separately would be to directly include it in the main spec-
ification. However, in this case the TLTRO-ratio could only enter model 2. To ensure comparability
of estimates stemming from the model choice and not from different control variables, I chose to report
results separately in Table 8.
20
empirically tested by Kandrac and Schlusche (2016). In addition to controlling for the
deposit-to-assets ratio and the reserves-to-asset ratio in all regressions, panels b and c of
Figure 4 show the evolution of those variables for the two groups of banks. Although the
central bank reserves ratio increases sharply starting at the beginning of 2015, banks with
a higher yield drop do not face a larger increase compared to banks with a low drop in
yield. Similarly, there is no differential pattern for the evolution of the deposit-to-assets
ratio. Thus, the MP variable does not proxy for this reserve-induced portfolio rebalancing
effect.
4.2 Securities Analysis
This section investigates whether banks more affected by the unconventional monetary
policy reduce their overall securities holdings and realize the gains from holding securities
with a high drop in yield (Hypothesis ii). Before conducting a detailed analysis Figure 5
shows the evolution of the securities to total assets ratio of banks more and less affected
by monetary policy. Banks more affected reduce their nominal overall security holdings
throughout 2014 and 2015, whereas banks less affected by the yield decline do not seem to
adjust their securities portfolio. A similar pattern emerges when examining the fraction
of securities with a high decline in yield to total assets in Figure 6. The Figure shows that
banks more affected by the monetary policy induced yield decline decrease their holdings
of securities with the highest valuation gains. Banks with a lower average yield decline
do not seem to reduce their holdings of these securities.
A more formal analysis, i.e. the results of estimating Equation (3), is presented in
Table 9. Column 1 shows that banks more affected by unconventional monetary policy
reduce their overall nominal securities holdings after the shock. Economically, banks with
a one standard deviation drop in the average yield of their securities portfolio reduce
their overall holdings of securities by approximately 5.5% (0.41*(-0.133)). In column
2 I add security*time fixed effects and find similar results in terms of significance and
magnitude. Banks more affected by monetary policy decrease their security holdings
by 5.1%. In column 3 I add the triple interaction term between MPi
, POSTt
, and
High-yield-declinej
along with all other double interaction terms between those three
variables. I find that after the monetary policy induced yield decline, banks more affected
by monetary policy (i.e. with a one standard deviation decline) reduce their holdings of
securities with the highest yield decline by 5.6%. The coefficient of MPi
*POSTt
remains
largely unchanged in column 3. In columns 4 and 5 I successively saturate the econometric
model with bank*time and security*time fixed effects. The coefficient estimates of the
triple interaction term remain qualitatively similar. All in all, the results suggest that
21
banks more affected by monetary policy reduce both, their overall securities holdings and
the holdings of those securities that had the largest drop in yield, realizing the gains from
these securities.
Next, I investigate the type of securities that banks more affected by unconventional
monetary policy are reducing. Corporate bonds are most comparable in their character-
istics to book credit. An interesting question therefore is, whether banks are especially
reducing their holdings of this particular asset class. To this end, I consider corporate
bonds, government bonds, and other securities.18 I repeat the same type of security hold-
ings regressions for the different issuer sectors in Table 10, where I include security*time
fixed effects, bank fixed effects, and time-varying bank-level controls into the regression.
Looking only at the size of the coefficient estimates, the results might suggest that the
rebalancing motive might be largest for corporate securities. However, one has to bear
in mind that corporate bonds account only for a small fraction of overall banks' security
holdings.19 In terms of nominal amounts, the largest reduction concerns the holdings of
securities issued by financial institutions.
In unreported regressions I have investigated whether there is a differential heterogene-
ity in the securities holdings with respect to the equity ratio. I do not find evidence in
favor of the hypothesis that banks with a low equity ratio reduce their securities holdings
more strongly. One potential explanation might be that, outside crisis times, equity does
not constitute a constraint for comparatively well-capitalized German banks.
Following Albertazzi et al. (2018), I have analyzed whether banks more affected by
monetary policy rebalance towards securities with a higher yield.20 I do not find evidence
for this kind of rebalancing into higher yielding securities. Similar as Albertazzi et al.
(2018), I argue that one possible explanation might be that yields were already so com-
pressed in Germany that, against the background of a home-bias, investing in securities
with a relatively high yield would make it necessary to heavily change the portfolio com-
position. This highlights the economic plausibility of my findings: given the relative price
change between securities and book credit banks favor a rebalancing towards lending.
18Those include mainly issues of financial institutions and, to a much smaller extend, of public sector
entities like agencies etc.
19The fraction of the total nominal amount of corporate bonds held by the banks in my sample in
2014m1 amounts to 1.8% of the total securities portfolio.
20This can be tested by the inclusion of an interaction term between MPi
, POSTt
, and the time varying
yield of the security yieldj,t
into the security-level regression equation 3.
22
4.3 Robustness
So far, I found significant effects of the monetary policy induced yield decline on bank
lending and securities holding behavior. In this section, I test the robustness of these
results. Most importantly, to test whether the MP variable picks up any other observable
or unobservable traits that might be linked to banks' lending behavior, I run placebo
regressions with a different timing of the dependent variable. I regress the change in
the logarithm of newly issued loans between 2011 and 2013, i.e. in a period where the
differential yield decline should have no effect on bank lending, on all control variables
from above. Table 11 shows the results of this falsification exercise. As expected, the
MP variable is not statistically significant and has the wrong sign in all regressions. This
points towards the exogeneity of the MP variable. Hence, the change in lending outcomes
observable in the period under investigation is most likely attributable to the yield drop
as opposed to an alternative observable or unobservable force.
I present additional robustness checks in Table A1 of the Appendix. First, I show
results for an alternative dependent variable. Instead of newly issued credit, in column
2 of Table A1 I use the outstanding stock of credit as outcome variable. The previous
results hold. As expected, the magnitude of the effect is reduced in this case because
the credit stock includes maturing assets, which might lead to a smaller increase of this
variable as opposed to the amount of truly newly issued loans. Looking at the coefficient
of the MP variable in column 2 of Table A1 banks with a one standard deviation decrease
of their average yield (0.41) in their portfolio increase their outstanding stock of credit by
approximately 3% between 2013 and 2015.
Column 3 of Table A1 shows results with a dummy variable instead of the continuous
MP variable. The dummy takes the value of 1 for banks with a yield drop above the median
of the MP variable distribution. The baseline result remains qualitatively unchanged.
Next, to further highlight the economic plausibility of my results, in column 4 of
Table A1 I weight the MP variable with the securities to assets ratio. The rebalancing
motive should be larger for banks that hold a larger fraction of yield-decreasing securities
relative to their total balance sheet. As expected, this robustness check indicates that the
size of the securities portfolio plays a role in the strength of the rebalancing motive.
To rule out that the results are driven by potential outliers or the level of winsorization
applied to the outcome variable in all preceding regressions, I present the results of two
additional specifications. In column 5 of Table A1 I winsorize the MP variable at the 1%
and at the 99%-level of the distribution with little impact on the coefficient estimates. I
23
report results without winsorizing the dependent variable in column 6. The findings are
confirmed.
Next, instead of estimating an interaction term between the maturing asset ratio and
the MP variable, I split the sample according to the median of the maturing assets to
total assets ratio in columns 7 and 8. As expected the statistical and economic significance
is larger for banks with a higher maturing assets to total assets ratio. For banks with
below median maturing assets the coefficient estimate is still significant and positive.
Additionally, also the difference between the two coefficients of the two groups of banks
(with a high or low maturing asset ratio) is significant for both models.21
Eventually, I change the timing of the construction of the MP variable. Instead of
calculating the decline in yields between January 2014 and June 2015, I choose a smaller
time window, i.e. January 2014 until December 2014. Results are robust to this alternative
timing and are displayed in column 9 of Table A1. The coefficient estimate of the MP
variable is somewhat smaller in this case. This makes sense economically, as yields further
declined after December 2014.
5 Conclusion
I have documented new stylized facts regarding the credit and security holdings of German
banks. The change in the spread between the average interest rates that German banks
charge on loans to the non-financial sector and the yield on securities that they hold has
increased during a time period of implementation of various unconventional monetary
policy measures. At the same time also the volume of credit supplied has increased in
relation to the nominal securities holdings.
Building on these stylized facts, in this paper I analyze the following questions: Given
the change in relative prices between securities and credit, do banks that face a larger
decrease in yields of their securities portfolio induced by unconventional monetary policy
measures supply more credit to the real sector? Do those banks also reduce their securities
investments, thus, changing their portfolio allocation? And if so, are those banks selling
the securities with the highest yield decline, thus realizing valuation gains? Are the effects
stronger for less capitalized banks?
21The p-value of the two-sided t-test of the difference between the two coefficients (with 87 degrees of
freedom, i.e. 102 observations-15 controls and fixed effects) is 3.9%. In both cases the t-statistic reads:
( ^
1
- ^
2
)/( se( ^
1
)2 + se( ^
2
)2).
24
The availability and combination of the securities register, bank balance sheet infor-
mation, and, most importantly, data from monetary policy implementation, provides a
comprehensive view on banks' balance sheets and facilitates to answer the above questions.
I find that banks experiencing higher drops in yields of their securities portfolio seek to
restore their targeted yield level by increasing their higher-yielding credit extension. This
effect is particularly pronounced for banks with many maturing assets that have to make
reinvestment decisions. At the same time, these banks reduce their security holdings and
realize the gains from securities with a high drop in yield. My results suggest that banks
actively rebalance their investments from the securities portfolio to the credit book, given
the change in the relative price between credit and securities. Thus, the paper sheds
additional light on how the transmission of unconventional monetary policy works at the
bank level.
My results are informative for the current debate on the effectiveness of unconventional
monetary policy. My paper highlights the importance of keeping hold of the impact of
these measures on financial markets as changes in relative prices between bonds and book
credit have implications for bank lending to the real sector.

A.1 Newsletter Articles
· Reuters 31.03.2014:
"...Speculation has also grown that it [ECB] may employ other easing measures
such as...U.S.-style bond-buying. ECB President Mario Draghi suggested after
the ECB's March meeting that the bank will either do nothing or take bold action
should the outlook deteriorate."
· Bloomberg 11.04.2014:
"Speculation is a big factor in the latest decline in bond yields in Spain, Italy, Portu-
gal, and Greece. Bond prices rose another notch and yields fell after ECB President
[Draghi] said the bank's Governing Council was "unanimous" on exploring tools in-
cluding purchases of debt, a European echo of the Federal Reserve's quantitative
easing (QE) program."
· The Telegraph 29.07.2014:
"...investors are starting to price in quantitative easing by the ECB, which would
entail sovereign bond purchases and potentially push yields lower."
· Financial Times 27.11.2014:
"Government borrowing rates across Europe fell to historic lows on Thursday as
speculation grows that the central bank is on the brink of buying large quantities
of sovereign."
