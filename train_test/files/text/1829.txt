Objective: To determine the US national prevalence of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
whether prevalence, recognition, and treatment vary by
socioeconomic group.
Design: Cross-sectional survey.
Setting: Nationally representative sample of the US popu-
lation from 2001 to 2004.
Participants: Eight- to 15-year-old children (N=3082)
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey.
Main Outcome Measures: The Diagnostic Interview
Schedule for Children (caregiver module) was used to
ascertain the presence of ADHD in the past year based
on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) criteria. Prior diagnosis of
ADHD by a health professional and ADHD medication
use were assessed by caregiver report.
Results: Of the children, 8.7% met DSM-IV criteria for
ADHD. The poorest children (lowest quintile) were more
likely than the wealthiest (highest quintile) to fulfill cri-
teria for ADHD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.3; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.9). Among children meeting
DSM-IV ADHD criteria, 47.9% had a prior diagnosis of
ADHD and 32.0% were treated consistently with ADHD
medications during the past year. Girls were less likely
than boys to have their disorder identified (AOR, 0.3; 95%
CI, 0.1-0.8), and the wealthiest children were more likely
than the poorest to receive regular medication treat-
ment (AOR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3-9.1).
Conclusions: Of US children aged 8 to 15 years, 8.7%, an

DESPITE WIDESPREAD CON-
cern that the rate of atten-
tion-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder(ADHD)isonthe
rise,1 the national popula-
tion-based prevalence of ADHD in US chil-
dren has not been firmly established. Prior
nationalpopulation-basedstudiesofAmeri-
can children have primarily used parental
report of an ADHD diagnosis, medical rec-
ord review, or medication use2-9 as prox-
ies for a formal ADHD diagnostic assess-
ment.OtherstudieshaveappliedDiagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(Third Edition)10 (DSM-III), Diagnostic and
StatisticalManualofMentalDisorders(Third
Edition­Revised)11 (DSM-III-R), and Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders (Fourth Edition)12 (DSM-IV) crite-
ria to determine diagnostic status, but those
samples have been regional or multisite co-
hort studies.13-30 Owing to differing meth-
odsofdeterminingdiagnosticstatusandre-
gional variations in prevalence, estimates
of ADHD prevalence in community-based
American samples have ranged from 2% to
26%.13-30 To our knowledge, to date, no US
nationally representative population-
based studies using DSM-IV criteria for
ADHD have been conducted in children.
In addition to ambiguity regarding over-
all ADHD prevalence, there is uncer-
tainty about prevalence of the ADHD sub-
types. The DSM-IV ADHD subtypes are
useful because each is differentially asso-
ciated with delinquency, comorbid con-
ditions, and life outcomes.31 Most of what
is known about ADHD subtype preva-
lence comes from clinic-based samples,
which have demonstrated higher rates of
ADHD­combined type (ADHD-CT) than
the other subtypes.31,32 However, interna-
tional and US regional population-based
studies have had mixed results, with some

showing a predominance of the inattentive subtype
(ADHD-IA)16,27,33 and others documenting highest rates
of ADHD-CT.30,34,35
The extent to which the prevalence of ADHD and its
subtypes varies by population characteristics, in particu-
lar socioeconomic and racial/ethnic status, is also un-
clear. Although an elevated ADHD prevalence is plau-
sible in lower-income populations because of their higher
rates of putative ADHD risk factors such as low birth
weight,36 lead exposure,37 and in utero tobacco expo-
sure,38 national studies have not observed a difference in
rates by income9 or have identified income-related dif-
ferences among boys but not girls.5 However, because
these studies relied on caregiver report of an ADHD di-
agnosis, the findings may reflect differential access to
health care or diagnostic bias. Results from US regional
studies using DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV criteria to
study ADHD rates in different income groups have var-
ied, with 2 documenting an elevated ADHD prevalence
in lower-income children and 1 finding no differ-
ence.21,24,25 Studies of ADHD rates in US racial/ethnic
groups have also been inconsistent. The US national stud-
ies have shown lower rates of reported ADHD diagnoses
in children from minority backgrounds,7,9 but 2 re-
gional studies found no difference in DSM-based ADHD
rates in non-Hispanic white and African American chil-
dren.21,30 Little information is available about DSM-
based rates of ADHD in Mexican American children,27,39
one of the fasting growing sectors of the US population.
There is also broad public concern about rates of psy-
chostimulant use for ADHD,40 yet these concerns are dif-
ficult to evaluate because most studies have not bench-
marked the appropriateness of medication treatment
against actual DSM-based diagnostic status.15,28,29 Prior
national studies have documented lower rates of ADHD
medication use in uninsured children, African Ameri-
can children, and Hispanic children but no difference in
use by income.3,5,41 However, because these studies ex-
amined psychostimulant use without information about
ADHD symptoms and impairment, it is unclear whether
differences in medication use signify undertreatment in
specific groups.
The purpose of this study was to examine ADHD preva-
lence in a national population-based sample of US chil-
dren assessed with a DSM-IV­based diagnostic instru-
ment. We also investigated sociodemographic predictors
of ADHD and the likelihood of receiving a prior diagno-
sis and medication treatment among children who ful-
fill DSM-IV ADHD criteria.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES)42 is an annual multistage probability sample sur-
vey of the noninstitutionalized US population, including an
oversample of minority populations. A total of 3907 children
aged 8 to 15 years participated in NHANES from 2001 to 2004,
with data regarding DSM-IV ADHD diagnostic status available
for 3082 children (78.9% of total). Approximately 10% of chil-
dren lacked DSM-IV ADHD data because they did not com-
plete a previously required survey component at the NHANES
mobile examination center, and caregivers of another 10% could
not be located for the ADHD interview, refused, or had a pri-
mary language other than English or Spanish. Those with
DSM-IV ADHD information did not differ from those without
in terms of sex (P=.84), report of prior ADHD diagnosis (P=.93),
or health insurance status (P=.45). However, those lacking
DSM-IV ADHD data were significantly more likely to be younger
(mean age, 9.9 years vs 12.1 years), poorer (lowest income quin-
tile, 24.9% vs 18.9%), and African American (17.0% vs 14.7%).
OUTCOMES
The National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview
Schedule for Children­IV (DISC-IV), a structured diagnostic
interview instrument designed for use in epidemiologic stud-
ies, was used to assess the presence of ADHD based on DSM-IV
criteria. This study used the ADHD DISC caregiver module,
which has evidence of substantial validity,43 reliability for both
its English43 and Spanish44,45 versions, and successful use with
the telephone in the DSM-IV field trials.32 Caregivers com-
pleted the DISC telephone interview 2 to 4 weeks after the child's
NHANES mobile examination center evaluation, providing in-
formation about the child's ADHD symptoms, age at onset, symp-
tom pervasiveness, and related impairments during the prior
12 months. The DISC algorithms determine ADHD diagnostic
status and ascertain ADHD subtype (ADHD-IA, ADHD-CT, and
hyperactive-impulsive type [ADHD-HI]). In addition, ques-
tions on the DISC inquire about use of "medicine for being over-
active, being hyperactive, or having trouble paying attention"
in the past 12 months and whether medication was taken "most
of the time during the last year" (ie, consistent medication treat-
ment) (D. J. Brody, MPH, written communications, October
17, 2006). To determine whether a child had been previously
diagnosed as having ADHD, caregivers were asked, "Has a doc-
tor or health professional ever told you that [child's name] had
attention deficit disorder?"46 during the administration of a sepa-
rate NHANES interview module.
PREDICTORS
Predictors considered in these analyses included the child's age,
sex, race/ethnicity, household income to poverty line ratio (PIR),
and health insurance status. The PIR is the ratio of the re-
ported household income to the poverty threshold appropri-
ate for household size. To capture the distribution across the
US population, the PIR was categorized into quintiles. Child
race/ethnicity was designated by caregivers and included the
following categories: non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
other Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and other (including mul-
tiracial). Because of the small number of subjects in the "other
Hispanic" and "other (including multiracial)" groups (n=115
and n=107, respectively), they were combined into a single
"other race/ethnicity" category.
ANALYSES
To account for the complex survey design, sample weights and
design variables were applied according to National Center for
Health Statistics guidelines to generate all estimates. These
sample weights were calculated from the base probabilities of
selection, adjusted for nonresponse, and poststratified to match
population control totals. Analyses were performed using SAS
statistical software, version 9 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North
Carolina), procedures for analysis of complex surveys.
Descriptive statistics on the national prevalence of ADHD
and ADHD subtypes are given for the sample overall and across

socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. For children meet-
ing DSM-IV ADHD criteria, rates of caregiver-reported diag-
noses (ie, prior disorder recognition) and medication treat-
ment are also summarized overall and across demographic
groupings. We used 2 tests to assess bivariate associations be-
tween the demographic predictor variables and ADHD diag-
nostic status, prior disorder recognition, and treatment status.
To adjust for the effects of the demographic variables on ADHD
status, prior disorder recognition, and history of ADHD treat-
ment, multivariable logistic regression was performed with in-
come, race/ethnicity, age, and sex included as predictors. In ad-
dition, for models predicting prior disorder recognition and
history of ADHD treatment, health insurance status and ADHD
subtype were included to account for differential access to care
and the potential bias toward diagnosing and treating chil-
dren with more externalizing behaviors.
The institutional review board of Cincinnati Children's Hos-
pital Medical Center determined this study to be exempt from
its review.
RESULTS
PREVALENCE OF ADHD
Among participants aged 8 to 15 years, 8.7% (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 7.3%-10.1%) met DSM-IV criteria
for ADHD in the year prior to the survey, equivalent to
2.4 million children in the United States (Table 1). An
additional 3.3% (95% CI, 2.4%-4.1%) did not meet
DSM-IV ADHD criteria but had both a parent-reported
prior diagnosis of ADHD and treatment with ADHD medi-
cations at some time during the past 12 months. How-
ever, the following results focus on those meeting DSM-IV
ADHD criteria in the past year.
In bivariate analyses, rates of meeting DSM-IV ADHD
criteria were higher in boys than girls (11.8% vs 5.4%;
P.001) and higher in non-Hispanic white children
than Mexican Americans or children of "other race/
ethnicity" (Table 2).
In multivariable models, the poorest children were
more than twice as likely as the wealthiest to meet cri-
teria for ADHD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for PIR, first
quintile vs fifth quintile, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.9) (Table 2).
Multivariable analyses confirmed that boys had an in-
creased likelihood of ADHD (AOR vs girls, 2.3; 95% CI,
1.8-2.9), whereas Mexican Americans and children of
"other race/ethnicity" had lower likelihoods compared
with non-Hispanic white children (AOR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-
0.8, and AOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9, respectively).
PREVALENCE OF ADHD SUBTYPES
Of the children, 4.4% met criteria for ADHD-IA, 2.2%
for ADHD-CT, and 2.0% for ADHD-HI (Table 1). Sub-
type differences were observed among the various in-
come and racial/ethnic groups (Table 3). The poorest
children had a higher likelihood of ADHD-HI compared
with the wealthiest (AOR for PIR, first vs fifth quintile,
3.1; 95% CI, 1.2-8.3). African Americans and Mexican
Americans had a lower likelihood of ADHD-IA rates com-
pared with non-Hispanic white children (AOR, 0.4; 95%
CI, 0.2-0.8, for both).

Boys had an increased likelihood of meeting
DSM-IV criteria for all ADHD subtypes compared with
girls in bivariate analyses (ADHD-CT: 3.3% vs 1.0%,
P.001; ADHD-IA: 5.7% vs 3.1%, P=.004; ADHD-HI:
2.8% vs 1.2%, P=.01). In multivariable analyses, this
pattern of male predominance was strongest for
ADHD-CT (AOR vs girls, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.9-5.5) but was
also significant for ADHD-IA (AOR vs girls, 1.8; 95%
CI, 1.2-2.8) and ADHD-HI (AOR vs girls, 2.2; 95% CI,
1.1-4.5).
Younger children were observed to have higher
ADHD-HI rates compared with older children (2.8% for
8- to 11-year-olds vs 1.3% for 12- to 15-year-olds; P=.03)
in bivariate analyses, but this difference reached only bor-
derline significance in multivariable analyses (AOR, 1.9;
95% CI, 0.9-3.9).
REPORTED PRIOR DIAGNOSIS
AMONG CHILDREN MEETING
DSM-IV ADHD CRITERIA
Among those meeting DSM-IV ADHD criteria during the
past year, 47.9% (95% CI, 39.5%-56.2%) of caregivers
reported that their child had received an ADHD diagno-
sis by a health professional. In bivariate analyses, signifi-
cant predictors of prior ADHD recognition included
non-Hispanic white race, male sex, older age, and
receipt of health insurance (Table 4). Multivariable
analyses confirmed male sex, older age, and health
insurance receipt as predicting a greater likelihood of
prior ADHD recognition (P=.03, P.001, and P=.002,
respectively), whereas race/ethnicity was no longer sig-
nificant. Income and ADHD subtype were not associated
with prior diagnosis among children meeting DSM-IV
ADHD criteria.
MEDICATION USE AMONG CHILDREN
MEETING DSM-IV ADHD CRITERIA
Of the children who met DSM-IV ADHD criteria, 38.8%
(95% CI, 30.3%-47.3%) reportedly received medication
to treat inattention, hyperactivity, or overactivity at any
time in the prior year, and 32.0% (95% CI, 25.7%-
38.3%) received medication for most of the past year (ie,
consistent use). Child age was the only significant so-
ciodemographic predictor of any ADHD medication use
in the past year in multivariable analyses, with an in-
creased likelihood of treatment for older children
(Table 5). However, income was a significant predic-
tor of consistent medication treatment. Among children
meeting DSM-IV ADHD criteria, only 15.5% (95% CI,
5.5%-25.5%) of the poorest children (PIR, first quintile)
had received ADHD medications for most of the previ-
ous year, with their likelihood of consistent medication
receipt being less than one-third that of children in other
income groups (Table 5). There was also a trend toward
increased regular medication use in older children. Race/
ethnicity was not associated with consistent ADHD medi-
cation use.
COMMENT
In a nationally representative sample of children aged 8
to 15 years, 8.7% met DSM-IV criteria for any type of
ADHD in the year prior to the survey, equivalent to ap-
proximately 2.4 million children. We found a higher
prevalence of meeting DSM-IV ADHD criteria in the poor-
est children, particularly for ADHD-HI. Mexican Ameri-
can children had lower overall rates of ADHD, and both
Mexican Americans and African Americans had lower

rates of ADHD-IA. Despite rising public awareness of
ADHD, less than half of children who met DSM-IV ADHD
criteria had reportedly had their conditions diagnosed by
a health care professional or been treated with medica-
tions. Girls were less likely to have their disorder recog-
nized, and the poorest children were least likely to re-
ceive consistent ADHD medication treatment.
ADHD AND ADHD SUBTYPE PREVALENCE
OurestimateofoverallADHDprevalenceiswithintherange
of prior ADHD prevalence measurements in US regional
studies using DSM-IV criteria (2.6%-11.4%).15,16,20,27,30
However, the present study's use of a national sample al-
lows increased generalizability and more precisely char-
acterizes the magnitude of the disorder. In this sample,
ADHD-IA was the most common ADHD subtype, a find-
ing that concurs with 2 US regional and 2 international
population-based studies of ADHD prevalence16,27,33,47
but is in contrast to the results of 1 US regional30 and 2
international population-based investigations.34,35 Pos-
sible reasons for differences include parents' varying cul-
tural expectations of behavioral norms or changes in
media coverage increasing awareness of inattentive
symptoms. The distribution of ADHD etiologic factors
may also have varied, leading to true differences in sub-
type predominance.
ADHD PREVALENCE WITHIN
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC SUBGROUPS
The nation's poorest children had an increased likelihood
of meeting DSM-IV ADHD criteria. This is consistent with
the findings of 2 US regional population-based studies that
used DSM-III-R criteria for outcome assessment.21,24 In ad-
dition, we found higher rates of ADHD-HI in lower-
income children, supporting the results of a prior clinical
referral sample in which socioeconomic status was lowest
for patients with ADHD-HI and highest for for those with
ADHD-IA.31 Because the findings of these DSM-based in-
vestigations were in regional, predominately non-
Hispanic white communities or clinically referred samples,
our nationally representative study improves understand-
ing of the ADHD burden facing poor children across the
UnitedStates.ReasonsfortheincreasedlikelihoodofADHD
in poorer children may include the elevated prevalence of
ADHD risk factors (ie, premature birth36 and in utero38 or
childhood exposures to toxic substances37) in this group.
In addition, given the high heritability of ADHD48 and its
negative impact on social, academic, and career out-
comes,49 it is plausible that families with ADHD may clus-
ter within the lower socioeconomic strata.
Inaccordancewith2DSM-basedinvestigations,weob-
served no significant difference in overall ADHD rates be-
tweennon-HispanicwhitechildrenandAfricanAfricans,21,30
although African Americans had lower rates of ADHD-IA.
We also found that Mexican American children had half
the likelihood of meeting DSM-IV criteria for any type of
ADHDcomparedwithnon-Hispanicwhitechildren.Given

REPORTED PRIOR DIAGNOSIS RATES
AMONG CHILDREN WITH ADHD
Wefoundthat48%ofchildrenmeetingDSM-IVADHDcri-
teria had reportedly been diagnosed as having ADHD by a
health care professional. Unlike prior national studies, in
whichAfricanAmericanracewasassociatedwithlowerrates
of reported ADHD diagnosis,7,9 race/ethnicity did not pre-
dictpriorrecognitionamongthosemeetingADHDDSM-IV
criteria. In addition, income level and ADHD subtype were
not associated with reported prior ADHD diagnosis among
childrenmeetingDSM-IVcriteria,whereasolderage(12-15
years old) and male sex did predict a prior diagnosis. Our
results suggest a need for health care professionals to in-
crease their index of suspicion regarding the likelihood of
ADHDingirls.50 DespiteconcernsthatADHDmaybeover-
looked in patients from minority backgrounds51 and those
with ADHD-IA,52 we did not find evidence of preferential
underrecognition in these groups.

cation treatment during the past year. To our knowl-
edge, only a few prior population-based studies, con-
ducted in single-site15,28 or multisite29 samples, have
reported on treatment received by children with ADHD
using a DSM-diagnosed sample. Rates of ADHD medica-
tion treatment among those meeting DSM-IV ADHD cri-
teriawerehigherinourstudythanthoseobservedbyJensen
et al (12% for use in the previous 12 months)29 and Wol-
raich et al (15%-27% for current medication use)15 but
lower than rates documented by Angold et al (72% for any
use during a 4-year period).28 These differences may be
due to variations in regional prescribing practices or to dif-
fering time frames for outcome assessment.
Although prior national studies found no disparity in
medication treatment rates by income,3,41 we found that
among children fulfilling DSM-IV ADHD criteria, the
poorest children were 3 to 5 times less likely to receive
consistent medication treatment compared with other
income groups. In a prior regional study using a DSM-III-
R­based assessment for ADHD, income-related differ-
ences were not observed for the likelihood of any ADHD
pharmacotherapy during a multiyear span.28 However,
because the prior study did not comment on the duration
and regularity of medication treatment by subgroup, a
comparison is not available for our findings regarding
consistent ADHD medication treatment. Although prior
national studies found that racial/ethnic minority popu-
lations are less likely to use ADHD medications com-
pared with non-Hispanic white children,3,5 we found no
significant racial/ethnic group differences in the likeli-
hood of pharmacotherapy among those with DSM-IV­
defined ADHD.
LIMITATIONS
One limitation relates to how the ADHD diagnosis was
derived for this study. The American Academy of Pedi-
atrics recommends that both caregiver and teacher re-
ports be used to inform a clinical diagnostic evaluation
for ADHD.52 However, DSM-IV criteria state simply that
impairment must exist in 2 or more settings and do not
specifically require 2 reporters.12 The NHANES used only
the DISC caregiver module for ADHD assessment, a struc-
tured diagnostic interview designed for use in large-
scale epidemiologic surveys.43 Notably, the DISC inter-
view assesses symptom pervasiveness by asking caregivers
to report symptoms and impairment at home and at school
or other activities.12 To our knowledge, no prior US popu-
lation-based studies using DSM-IV ADHD criteria have
gathered clinical data from both caregivers and teach-
ers.15,16,20,27,30 Nonetheless, lower overall rates of ADHD
and different subtype rates may result when reports from
both teachers and parents are available.53,54
Another potential limitation pertains to the influence
of cultural behavioral norms on caregiver symptom
reports, as sociodemographic differences in prevalence

may be partially due to culturally divergent ratings of
ADHD symptoms.55 In addition, circumstances are diffi-
cult to interpret for the 3.3% of children who had a
reported diagnosis of ADHD and were receiving medi-
cation but did not meet DSM-IV ADHD criteria. The
NHANES' cross-sectional design does not allow us to
distinguish those who intially met DSM-IV criteria but
whose symptoms were reduced below the threshold by
medication from those who were prescribed medication
inappropriately. Therefore, these 3.3% were not in-
cluded in our overall ADHD prevalence measurement, a
factor that may make our estimate of 8.7% a conserva-
tive approximation. Missing data could also have
altered the observed prevalence rates. However, given
that the analyses incorporated sample weights account-
ing for differential nonresponse, bias due to this factor
is minimized. Furthermore, although this study is of
substantial dimension, sample size was still limited for
sociodemographic subgroup analyses, particularly for
ADHD subtype prevalence.
Finally, our medication treatment outcome was as-
sessed via parent report, whereas review of medical or
pharmacy records would have been preferable. In addi-
tion, although we are able to determine the prevalence
of reported pharmacotherapy in children with DSM-IV­
defined ADHD and its variation across sociodemo-
graphic groups during the year prior to the survey, we
cannot comment on reasons for the rates or differences
observed. Although there are often compelling reasons
to try stimulant medication treatment in children with
ADHD, including robust data confirming short-term
symptom improvement, reduced impairment, and pro-
tection against future adverse outcomes such as sub-
stance abuse,56,57 stimulant medications are sometimes
discontinued owing to lack of efficacy or or unaccept-
able adverse effects.58 Because the NHANES does not con-
tain information about lifetime ADHD medication treat-
ment, we are unable to differentiate children who never
tried ADHD medications from those who did not con-
tinue because of ineffectiveness or adverse effects. Fi-
nally, although behavioral interventions for ADHD are
important, the NHANES does not contain specific infor-
mation about nonpharmacologic treatments for atten-
tional problems.
CONCLUSIONS
We found DSM-IV­diagnosed ADHD to be prevalent in
American children and more common among the poor-
est children. Children from minority backgrounds had
lower rates of ADHD-IA, whereas the poorest children
had an increased likelihood of ADHD-HI. If this study is
replicated, etiologic factors that may partially explain
these differences--such as varying rates of in utero to-
bacco exposure, childhood lead exposure, and compli-
cations of pregnancy and delivery--should be investi-
gated so that future public health efforts can be directed
at preventing ADHD in groups at highest risk. We also
observed that less than half of children who met DSM-IV
criteria for ADHD had reportedly had their conditions
diagnosed or been treated with ADHD medications, sug-
gesting that some children with clinically significant in-
attention and hyperactivity may not be receiving opti-
mal interventions. Finally, our finding of a lower
likelihood of consistent medication use in the poorest chil-
dren warrants further investigation and possible inter-
vention to ensure that all children with ADHD have eq-
uitable access to treatment when appropriate.
