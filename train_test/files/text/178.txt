are related to pediatric body mass index and obesity: Results
from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey. Obes Res. 2000;8:575­581.
Objective: Clinical research has shown an increased preva-
lence of obesity in children with asthma. This study was
designed to assess the relationship between asthma and
pediatric body mass index (BMI) in a national database and
to examine factors that may modify this relationship.
Design: The cross-sectional relationship between asthma
and pediatric BMI and obesity (BMI  85th percentile) was
studied. Variables that may influence the relationship be-
tween asthma and pediatric BMI, such as race/ethnicity and
television watching were included in the model for the total
sample. A smaller sample of 3009 white and African Amer-
ican youth were studied in regression models including
maternal BMI.
Study Population: A nationally representative cross-
sectional sample of 5154 children and adolescents of 6 to 16
years of age from the Third National Health And Nutrition
Examination Survey.
Results: In the full sample, asthma and television watching
were related to BMI, accounting for 3% of the variance in
BMI. When maternal BMI was included in the non-
Hispanic sample, television watching, maternal BMI, and
the interaction of maternal BMI and asthma were related to
youth BMI, accounting for 15% of the variance. The stan-
dardized BMI z-score for those youth without asthma and
no maternal obesity was 0.06, which increased to 0.33 if the
youth had asthma, to 0.70 if the youth did not have asthma
but the mother was obese, and to 1.71 if the youth had
asthma and the mother was obese. Asthma, television
watching, and maternal BMI were independent predictors of
youth obesity.
Conclusions: BMI and prevalence of obesity is higher in
youth with asthma. Pediatric BMI, but not obesity, is also
related to the interaction of asthma and maternal BMI in
white and African American youth. Comorbidity of
asthma and obesity may complicate treatment of either
condition, and prevention of obesity should be encour-
aged for asthmatic children.

Introduction
Obesity and asthma are two major causes of morbidity in
the United States (1,2), with asthma the principle cause of
chronic illness and school absenteeism in children (1).
These are also two of the most prevalent pediatric disorders
in the United States. Approximately one-fourth of children
and adolescents are obese (2), and 10% to 15% of boys and
7% to 10% of girls are diagnosed with asthma during
childhood (3). The prevalence of obesity (2) and asthma
(1,4) is increasing.
Recently, we examined the relationship between asthma
and obesity in a predominantly Hispanic inner-city pediatric
sample of 171 children and adolescents and found that
youth with asthma had significantly greater body mass
index (BMI) values than youth without asthma, and that
2.5 times as many children with asthma were obese com-

pared with children without asthma (5). These results are
consistent with the relationships that have been observed
between obesity and asthma for other groups of minority
children (6,7), but it is important to confirm these clinical
observations on a more representative sample.
Identification of comorbidity between these two preva-
lent pediatric disorders has important implications for the
prevention and treatment of these problems. If asthma is a
risk factor for the development of obesity, it may be impor-
tant for pediatricians to monitor BMI in youth with asthma
and associated risk factors to prevent comorbidity of asthma
and obesity. If obesity does develop in children with
asthma, implementation of dietary and activity programs is
needed. However, there may be limitations in attempts to
increase physical activity in children with asthma. Children
with asthma frequently have exercise-induced broncho-
spasm, which can decrease their participation in sports and
vigorous free play (1,8), and the aversiveness of subjective
symptoms associated with exercise-induced bronchospasm
(9) may make it more difficult to increase physical activity
in an obese child with asthma.
The purpose of this study was to determine the relation-
ship between asthma and obesity in a large pediatric sample.
We hypothesize that asthma, along with the traditional risk
factors for obesity of television watching (10) and maternal
obesity (11), will be related to pediatric BMI. We also
assess whether asthma interacts with other risk factors to
increase youth BMI.
Research Methods and Procedures
Data and Sample
The Third National Health And Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) assesses a representative sample of
the population in the United States. Data were collected in
two phases by the National Center for Health Statistics of
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, between
1988 and 1991 and between 1991 and 1994. The total
sample interviewed across all ages was 33,994. Our sample
was composed of the 5154 youths with obesity and asthma
data between the ages of 6 and 16, which was 76.3% of the
available sample.
Measurements
The major dependent variable was pediatric BMI (BMI 
kg/m2, height measured with a stadiometer and weight, with
a balance beam scale). To control for age and gender
influences, BMI values for children, mothers, and fathers
were converted to z-scores using gender- and age-appropri-
ate means and SDs reported in NHANES II (12). Obesity
status was based on being equal to or greater than the 85th
percentile BMI in the NHANES II reference data.
Race and ethnicity codes were developed from the
NHANES questions on race and ethnicity. Participants were
classified as white, African American, or Hispanic based on
responses to the race/ethnicity question. Additional subjects
were classified as Hispanics based on affirmative responses
to Mexican American of unknown race on the race question
and other Hispanic ethnicity on the ethnicity question.
Asthma status (yes/no) was determined by the parent-com-
pleted item, "Did a doctor ever say that (child's name) had
asthma?" Hours of watching television were estimated with
a question from the youth examination that asked, "How
many hours of television did (child's name) watch yester-
day?," ranging from 0 to 5 hours. Family income was
estimated using the poverty income ratio, which is based on
family income and family size. A ratio of 1 is at the poverty
level.
Analytical Plan
Analyses and descriptives statistics used NHANES
weighting variables that take the complex sampling design
into account to estimate population values. Analyses were
completed with replicate weights for estimating variance
and SEs for testing parameter coefficients, using the Wes-
Var PC software package (Westat, Rockville, MD) (13).
The full sample weight variable was used, with Fay's
method of balanced repeated replication, using a perturba-
tion factor of 70% as the replication method. Multiple linear
regression models were constructed to examine variables
that predicted youth BMI standardized for age and gender.
Categorical predictor variables were dummy-coded before
entry into the model. Interactions between asthma and gen-
der, age, race/ethnicity, television watching, and maternal
BMI were explored. In addition, logistic regression models
were used to predict youth obesity. Odds ratios (ORs) for
obesity were determined controlling for gender, age, and
race/ethnicity.
The sample size for the relationship between obesity,
asthma, and television watching was the entire cohort of
children (N  5154) with obesity and asthma data. In
addition to these relationships, we also were interested in
examining other variables that may relate to pediatric
obesity, including parental BMI (11) and income (14).
However, there was missing data for parental BMI and
income. A series of -square analyses was conducted to
evaluate whether inclusion of maternal BMI, paternal
BMI, or income was associated with significant differ-
ences in the proportion of subjects who were eliminated
for each racial/ethnic group. Inclusion of any of these
variables produced a significant reduction in Hispanic
subjects. When the sample was limited to non-Hispanic
youth, maternal BMI could be studied without a signifi-
cant loss of subjects between white and African Ameri-
can samples. However, when paternal BMI or income
was included in addition to maternal BMI, missing data
caused a significant reduction in the percentage of Afri-
can American youth included in the sample. The second

predictor of pediatric BMI and obesity in the non-
Hispanic population.
Results
Table 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of the entire
sample. Age was equally distributed across race/ethnic
groups. Slightly more than 25% (26.4%) of the sample was
obese, and 11.6% had diagnoses of asthma. Results from the
multiple regression model (Table 2) showed that asthma and
television watching were related to obesity. Controlling for
gender, age, and race/ethnicity, children with asthma were
1.53 times more likely (confidence interval [CI]  1.25 to
2.46) to be obese than children without asthma, and children
who watched 4 hours or more of television per day were
1.63 times more likely (CI  1.42 to 2.48) to be obese than
those who watched for 1 hour or less per day. No significant
interactions between asthma and other predictors were ob-
served. The model had an R of 0.18 and accounted for 3.4%
of the variation in children's BMI. The logistic regression
predicting pediatric obesity was significant F(6,47)  9.27,
p  0.001, accounting for 1.9% of the variability in pedi-
atric obesity. Significant independent predictors of obesity
included Hispanic race/ethnicity (p  0.025), television
watching (p  0.001), and pediatric asthma (p  0.005).
Hispanic youth were 1.35 times more likely to be obese than
white youth.
The descriptive characteristics of the restricted sample
that did not include Hispanic subjects are shown in Table 3.
This restricted sample included 25.3% of the children as
obese, and 11.1% with asthma. Over 28% (28.5%) of the
mothers of these children were obese. The results from the
regression model for this sample (Table 4) showed that
maternal standardized BMI was an additional significant
predictor of pediatric BMI, with an OR of 2.2 (CI  2.18 to
3.59) controlling for gender, age, and race/ethnicity.
Asthma was not a significant independent predictor, but
maternal standardized BMI interacted with pediatric asthma
to predict pediatric BMI. Television remained a significant
predictor, with an OR of 1.98 (CI  1.69 to 3.30) for those

watching for 4 or more hours per day, versus those watching
for 1 hour or less per day. The model had an R of 0.39 and
accounted for 15.0% of the variation in children's BMI. As
shown in Figure 1, pediatric asthma was associated with an
increment of 1 z-score unit if the mother was obese (1.71 to
0.70), whereas pediatric asthma only showed an increment
of 0.27 z-score unit if the mother was not obese (0.33 to
0.06). If maternal standardized BMI was not included, then
television (p  0.001) and asthma (p  0.02) were signif-
icant predictors of pediatric BMI, accounting for 3.7% of
the variance, similar to the amount of variance accounted
for in the regression model for the full sample with the same
predictors.
The logistic model was significant F(6,47)  17.12, p 
0.001, accounting for 6.9% of the variability in pediatric
obesity. Youth asthma (p  0.025), television watching
(p  0.001), and maternal BMI (p  0.001) were significant
independent predictors of pediatric obesity. Youth with
asthma were 1.65 times (CI  1.2 to 3.02) more likely to
become obese than youth without asthma, controlling for
gender, age, and race/ethnicity.
Discussion
This study confirms clinical observations (5) that pediatric
BMI is related to asthma during development, and provides the
new observation that pediatric BMI is related to the interaction
of maternal BMI and pediatric asthma. Asthma may influence
higher BMI by increasing caloric intake or decreasing expen-
diture. Asthma and maternal BMI were significant indepen-
dent predictors of pediatric obesity, but maternal BMI did not
interact with youth asthma to predict pediatric obesity. Re-
search suggests that caloric intake is similar in children with or
without asthma, but children with asthma are less active than
those without asthma (15,16). Resting energy expenditure,
which makes the largest contribution to total energy expendi-
ture, is greater, rather than suppressed, in children with asthma
in comparison with children without asthma (16). Taken to-
gether, these data support the hypothesis that increases in
obesity in children with asthma are related to decreases in
physical activity. The relationship between obesity and
television watching observed in this and other studies (10)
is consistent with inactivity being a major influence for the
development of obesity in children. Asthma did not inter-
act with television watching to influence obesity, perhaps
because the influence of television watching on pediatric
obesity is also very strong for children and adolescents
without asthma.
Maternal obesity is a traditional risk factor for pediatric
obesity (17). Forty percent of children with obese mothers
were obese, compared with 19.3% of children whose moth-
ers were not obese, a doubling of the risk. Maternal BMI
may predispose the child to a higher body weight based on
a number of factors. Genetic influences (18) may predispose
youth to develop obesity by having a lower threshold for
positive energy balance, such that children with maternal
obesity have to consume fewer calories or be more active
than children with lean parents to maintain normal body
weight (19). Gestational diabetes and metabolic dysregula-
tion during prenatal development (20) may predispose chil-
dren with obese mothers to develop obesity. Environmental
factors related to having a mother with high BMI, such as
modeling inactivity (21), development of food preferences
for high-calorie foods (22), and use of food as a reward (23),
may influence the development of obesity. Maternal BMI
also interacted with pediatric asthma to predict the contin-
uous variable of pediatric BMI. The combination of a ge-
netic or environmental predisposition to develop obesity in
combination with increased sedentary behavior and lowered
energy expenditure in children with asthma could increase
the susceptibility of these children to higher BMI values.
However, asthma and maternal BMI had significant and
independent effects when the dichotomous outcome, pedi-
atric obesity, was considered. Thus, there are differences in
predictors based on whether the continuous variable of
pediatric BMI or the dichotomous variable of non-obese/
obese is the dependent variable. Pediatric obesity is inde-
pendently related to asthma and maternal BMI, whereas
pediatric BMI is related to maternal BMI and the interaction
of maternal BMI and asthma. These differences may be due
to maternal BMI and asthma interacting in relationship to
pediatric BMI at lower levels than the 85th BMI percentile.
Likewise, the failure to observe the interaction of maternal
BMI and pediatric asthma may be due to reductions in
power to detect the interaction effect when dichotomous
rather than continuous variables are used as the dependent
variables.

We have demonstrated previously that pediatric
asthma and obesity were related in a predominately His-
panic sample (5), but methodological problems in the
current study limited studying maternal BMI as a predic-
tor of obesity in Hispanic youth. Future research is
needed to examine the joint influence of maternal BMI
and asthma on weight in Hispanic youth. Methodological
issues also limited the study of physical activity and
caloric intake as predictors of pediatric obesity. The only
measurement of physical activity available was the single
question that asked children, "How many times in the last
week did you play or exercise enough to make you sweat
or breathe hard?" Because asthma may alter the threshold
for breathing hard, this definition may not be measuring
similar degrees of physical activity for asthmatic and
non-asthmatic youth. The common method for collection
of nutritional information for children and adolescents in
NHANES III was a 24-hour dietary recall, with the recall
completed by the parents for children younger than 12. It
is well known that self-reported dietary information un-
derestimates caloric intake in comparison with objective
measures of energy balance (24,25). Consistent with
these data, previous analyses of the NHANES III data-
base showed no differences in the caloric intake of obese
and non-obese children (26). Dietary data were not in-
cluded to reduce the possibility of reporting a relation-
ship based on inaccurate self-reports.
If asthma is under proper control, children with asthma
experience few physical limitations (1). Children with
asthma who experience respiratory symptoms during ex-
ercise have poor control of their asthma, and even mild
asthma can be very restrictive if it is not properly con-
trolled with medications and environmental alterations.
Children with asthma and active lifestyles can have sim-
ilar exercise tolerance to control children without asthma.
Only the children with mild asthma and a sedentary
lifestyle had poor physical fitness (27). Likewise, when
children with and without asthma were matched on body

size and habitual physical activity, they did not differ in
fitness or pulmonary function (28).
Obesity may influence bronchial hyperactivity in children
without asthma (29). For example, wheezing was related to
increases in BMI or triceps skinfolds in NHANES II (30). A
significantly greater frequency and degree of bronchospasm
of the smaller airways occur in obese children without
asthma compared with their nonobese counterparts, which
is related to the amount of subcutaneous fat (29). Changes
in lung volume, as with obesity, can increase airway respon-
siveness in subjects without asthma, and chest wall loading
associated with obesity may mechanically alter airways,
increasing airway reactivity (31,32). Research suggests that
adult BMI is prospectively related to onset of asthma (33).
Research on the causal relationship between obesity and
asthma in youth is needed, including prospective research to
evaluate whether the onset of obesity precedes asthma in
pediatric samples, and whether weight loss improves pul-
monary functioning in pediatric obese asthma patients.
There are several clinical implications to the current
results. Pediatricians should be aware of the relationship
between asthma and obesity, and initiate preventive dietary
and activity measures if the child or adolescent with asthma
is in a family with an obese mother or if the child with
asthma begins to show large increases in BMI for his/her
age and gender. Children and adolescents with comorbid
asthma and obesity should be provided treatments for their
obesity, which include decreasing inactivity and increasing
vigorous physical activity to decrease body fat and improve
exercise tolerance. Comorbidity of these prevalent pediatric
conditions suggests that attention to reducing sedentary
behaviors and increasing physical activity may be important
in the prevention of obesity and treatment of asthma.
