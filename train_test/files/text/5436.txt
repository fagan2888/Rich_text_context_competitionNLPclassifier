Partisan conflict was not always the norm regarding cli-
mate policy (Ogden, 1971). However, contemporary elite
battles, with Republicans in the USA usually leading the
opposition to Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) poli-
cies, demonstrate a heightening partisan polarization
through both policy stances and rhetoric (Dunlap and
McCright, 2011; Fisher, 2006; McCright and Dunlap,
2010). Over the same period, American public opinion on
many different aspects of the AGW challenge has become
similarly polarized: Republicans have sustained a low level
of concern and low support for government-led policy
responses to AGW over the last two decades, while
Democrats have consistently become more concerned and
supportive of policy interventions over time (Dunlap et al.,
2016; Whitmarsh, 2011). Not only have concern and policy
attitudes polarized, but contemporary political debate on
AGW has also seen a rise in AGW conspiracy theories
(CTs) (Boussalis and Coan, 2016; Elsasser and Dunlap,
2012; McCright and Dunlap, 2010), primarily coming from
the right (e.g., Smith and Leiserowitz, 2012).
Conspiracies and misinformation are politically and
socially significant (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler, 2010; Oliver
and Wood, 2014; Uscinski and Parent, 2014); the misinfor-
mation and conspiracies surrounding climate change are
consequential for myriad reasons (e.g., Uscinski et al.,
2017), namely the clear linkage between conspiracy theory
belief and behaviors affecting the political system. For
example, beliefs that AGW is a hoax are negatively corre-
lated with pro-environmental behaviors (Jolley and Douglas,
2014), create an environment where attempts at delibera-
tion, negotiation and action about AGW are increasingly
difficult (Lewandowsky et al., 2015) and, through elections,
put into place a balance of representatives unwilling to
The impact of elite frames and motivated
reasoning on beliefs in a global warming
conspiracy: The promise and limits of trust
Kyle L Saunders
Abstract
Given the potential attitudinal and behavioral impact of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) conspiracy beliefs, it
is important to understand their causes and moderators. Here, two explanations for the variation in these beliefs are
engaged: the first is the choice among elites to frame AGW using the phrase `global warming' (GW) as opposed to
`climate change' (CC); the second is partisan motivated reasoning. A theory is then developed about the role of trust in
moderating the impact of the two frames on AGW conspiracy beliefs. In the case of CC, which is perceived as less severe
than GW (and is therefore less identity threatening among Republicans), it is hypothesized that trust will moderate hoax
beliefs among Republicans. In the case of GW, where the implications of existence beliefs have policy consequences that
are more unpleasant, motivated reasoning will `win out', and trust will not moderate conspiracy endorsement among
Republicans. The results from an original question framing experiment are consistent with the author's hypotheses.
Whilst trust is a welcome commodity to those looking to persuade citizens to support AGW-ameliorating policies, it is
not a cure-all, especially in the face of elite partisan cues that edify pre-existing attitudes/identities and arouse a strong
desire to engage in motivated reasoning.

address the challenge that climate change presents (Douglas
and Sutton, 2015).1
Given the potential attitudinal and behavioral effects of
belief onAGW CTs, it is important to understand the causes
of such beliefs, as well as any potential moderators. Here, I
engage two explanations ­ elite framing of the terms `global
warming' (GW) as contrasted with `climate change' (CC)
and partisan motivated reasoning ­ for the belief that AGW
is a conspiracy or hoax. I then develop a theory about the
moderating role of trust, not only in AGW conspiratorial
ideation but also across GW and CC frames.
Frank Luntz, elite framing, and the
CC/GW distinction
It is impossible to understand fully the causes of beliefs
about the existence and/or seriousness of AGW without
accounting for the different ways in which the AGW
issue has been strategically framed by increasingly polar-
ized political elites in order to affect attitudes (e.g.,
Leiserowitz et al., 2014; Schuldt et al., 2011). As such,
the first explanation is elite-driven partisan polarization
and framing (e.g., McCarty et al., 2006; Zaller, 1992) on
the issue of AGW (McCright and Dunlap, 2011; Dunlap
and McCright, 2011).
In 2002, pollster and strategist Frank Luntz advised the
Bush Administration to frame its discussion of AGW using
the term `climate change' instead of `global warming'.
Luntz (2002) suggested this because CC was naturally
occurring and therefore `less frightening'. The logic behind
Luntz's recommendation was to broaden the consensus in
the public that climate change was not that big of a deal. In
his strategy memo to Republican leaders, `Mr. Luntz urges
that the climate change term be used instead of global
warming because "while global warming has catastrophic
communications attached to it, climate change sounds a
more controllable and less emotional challenge"' (Lee,
2003). The recommendation was based in part on the pol-
icy implications of the GW frame (the solution for which
would be much stricter anti-pollution regulations that
would affect businesses) versus CC (a naturally occurring
fluctuation in temperature for which fewer, if any, policy
fixes are needed). Thus, elite discourse conducted through
the CC frame would be less likely to lead to division on the
issue inside the Republican coalition, leading to fewer
calls for policies antithetical to Republican values.
Political operatives like Luntz know that the framing of an
issue matters because it clarifies and condenses the issue for
the public (e.g., Nelson et al., 1997). In fact, framing experi-
ments confirm Luntz's assertions (but see Dunlap, 2014; Villar
and Krosnick, 2011). For example, compared to CC, people
are more concerned and worried about GW (Whitmarsh,
2009; Leiserowitz et al., 2014), believe that it is more tractable
(Whitmarsh, 2009), and are less likely to believe in its exist-
ence (Schuldt et al., 2011; Schuldt et al., 2015).
The role of partisanship and motivated
reasoning in the AGW discourse
However, the framing research described above obscures
the role that partisanship plays in the effect of strategic
AGW framing on individuals' attitudes. Partisan framing
is a conditioning factor in the delivery of information that
directs reasoning about that information: party elites can
polarize the discourse by structuring the frames around an
issue (Slothuus, 2010; Slothuus and de Vreese, 2010). In
fact, compared to CC, GW evokes stronger ratings of neg-
ative affect, greater worry, and greater perceptions of per-
sonal and family threat among Democrats than Republicans
(Kraft et al., 2015; Leiserowitz et al., 2014; Villar and
Krosnick, 2011). In contrast, the gap in the belief in the
existence of GW versus CC is greater for Republicans than
Democrats, with Republicans being more likely to deny
the existence of GW than CC (Schuldt et al., 2011; Schuldt
et al., 2015; but see Dunlap, 2014). This pattern of
responses is consistent with motivated reasoning: people
will engage in reasoning processes such as selective-expo-
sure, counter-arguing, and outright denial in the face of
identity-threatening or counter-attitudinal information in
order to protect, bolster or defend their pre-existing atti-
tudes and identities (Kunda, 1990; Lodge and Taber, 2013).
When it comes to the impact of AGW seriousness and
existence beliefs on environmental attitudes and partisan
identity, Republicans would be expected to be more
likely to engage in motivated reasoning than Democrats.
Specifically, Republicans are less supportive of pro-
environment policies than Democrats (e.g., Dunlap
et al., 2016). As such, Republicans would be expected to
engage in motivated AGW conspiracy endorsement to a
greater extent than Democrats (e.g., Smith and
Leiserowitz, 2012), to protect their pre-existing (anti-)
environmental policy attitudes.2
It also stands to reason that Republicans would be more
sensitive to the differences between the GW and CC frames
on conspiracy endorsement than Democrats. Given that
GW evokes, on average, stronger feelings of worry, per-
sonal threat and associations with severe weather than CC,
belief in the existence of GW would have more severe
environmental policy implications in the direction anti-
thetical to Republicans' pre-existing policy attitudes.
Consistent with this reasoning, Republicans are less likely
to believe that GW, rather than CC, exists, whereas
Democrats (for whom the policy and identity implications
are more consonant with their pre-existing attachments
and beliefs) do not distinguish between the two frames
with regard to existence beliefs.3 In summary, based on
motivated reasoning, the `default' is that Republicans
should be more likely than Democrats to believe that AGW
is a hoax, doing so to bolster/protect their pre-existing atti-
tudes and identities. Moreover, this motivated reasoning
among Republicans should be stronger when the CT is
Saunders 3
framed as GW than as CC, because GW is more identity-
threatening to Republicans than CC.
Research has demonstrated that Democrats and
Republicans alike are willing to suspend disbelief and
endorse CTs on all sorts of topics in the service of identity
and attitude protection, thus demonstrating the power of
motivated reasoning (e.g., Miller et al., 2016). To believe
that AGW is an elaborate hoax, for example, one must
believe in a vast conspiracy of elected and appointed gov-
ernmental officials, scientists, academics and journalists,
all coordinating to perpetrate an elaborate lie for decades
(e.g., see Grimes, 2016 and Keeley, 1999 on the viability of
unwarranted conspiracy beliefs). If partisan-motivated rea-
soning affects AGW conspiracy beliefs similar to how it
affects endorsement in other CTs, is there anything that
could moderate this process?
The moderating role of generalized
trust in motivated AGW conspiracy
endorsement
Kunda (1990) argued that motivated reasoning (`direc-
tional reasoning' in her language) was not as ubiquitous as
many contemporary scholars and observers perceived it to
be: `People do not seem to be at liberty to conclude what-
ever they want to conclude merely because they want to...
They draw the desired conclusion only if they can muster
up the evidence necessary to support it' (Kunda, 1990:
482­483, emphasis added). In other words, people engage
in a balancing act between wanting to protect and bolster
their attitudes/identities, and wanting to maintain an `illu-
sion of objectivity' (Kunda, 1990: 483). In this article, I
shine a spotlight on a heretofore under-examined factor
which might moderate motivated reasoning, especially in
the context of conspiracy endorsement ­ generalized trust
(in people, the media, and politicians and other political
actors).
Why trust? As Hetherington (1998) argued, trust is more
than just an indicator of how much people like politicians,
political institutions, and the like. Trust is an important
political and social commodity. Interpersonal trust and trust
in government are positively related to civic engagement
and, thus, social capital (Brehm and Rahn, 1997). Trust in
government also fosters inter-party cooperation among
political leaders (Hetherington and Rudolph, 2015). Trust
is also negatively correlated with conspiracy endorsement
in general (Miller et al., 2016). Not only does conspiracy
endorsement require some level of suspension of disbelief,4
it also requires a low level of trust in people, the media and
political institutions to do, at best, the right thing (or, at the
very least, to not engage in secret plots that involve lying to
the public in perpetuity).
With regard to the AGW conspiracy theory specifi-
cally, I argue that Republicans who might otherwise be
motivated to believe that AGW is an elaborate hoax (to
protect their partisan identity or pre-existing policy atti-
tudes) will be less likely to be able to `muster up the evi-
dence necessary'5 to do so if they also believe that people
and political actors are trustworthy. This gives rise to
Hypothesis 1:
H1: Trust will moderate AGW hoax beliefs for
Republicans (as trust increases, hoax beliefs will
decrease). For Democrats, as trust increases, belief in
the hoax will either also decrease or be unchanged
(given the likely floor effect in hoax beliefs for
Democrats).6
Miller et al.'s (2016) finding that trust moderates moti-
vated conspiracy endorsement across a wide range of CTs
implies that trust could be a `cure-all'. But is trust powerful
enough to mitigate conspiracy endorsement when the
implications for pre-existing attitudes and identities are
strong and salient? In other words, trust has promise as a
mitigating factor regarding motivated conspiracy endorse-
ment; does it also have limits?
With regard to AGW hoax beliefs, the effect of trust may
be more nuanced than previous research suggests.7 As
reviewed above, the desire to engage in motivated conspir-
acy endorsement when the issue is framed as being about
GW is likely to be stronger for Republicans (compared to
the CC frame) because the policy and identity implications
are much more unpleasant. Therefore, I hypothesize that
the two-way interaction between generalized trust and
party identification (H1) will be qualified by a three-way
interaction between trust, party identification and hoax
frame. Specifically, generalized trust will moderate moti-
vated conspiracy endorsement among Republicans when it
comes to CC, but will not have a similar moderating effect
when it comes to GW. In the balancing act between iden-
tity/attitude protection (motivated reasoning) and maintain-
ing an illusion of objectivity (thus rejecting that trustworthy
actors would engage in conspiracies), maintaining an illu-
sion of objectivity will `win out' with regard to CC (when
Republicans' identities are less threatened), whereas iden-
tity/attitude protection will `win out' with regard to GW
(when Republicans' identities are more threatened). Hence
I offer Hypothesis 2:
H2: For Republicans, trust will have a larger negative
effect on the belief that CC is a hoax than the belief that
GW is a hoax. For Democrats, trust will have either no
effect (because of the potential floor in endorsement) or
a negative effect on both the CC and GW question
frames.
Description of study and measures
To test these hypotheses, I analyzed an original online sur-
vey experiment of 2316 Republicans and Democrats
4 Research and Politics 
administered between 21 November and 13 December
2013 via Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The
use of MTurk in social science research is growing in popu-
larity because it provides access to more demographically
diverse samples of the US voting-age population than other
commonly-used convenience samples, and provides high-
quality data (e.g., Clifford et al., 2015; Huff and Tingley,
2015; Mullinix et al., 2015).
Experimental manipulation and dependent
variable
Respondents were randomly assigned to receive one of two
CT question frames: `Some people believe that [global
warming/climate change] is a hoax. Others do not believe
this. What do you think?' Responses were coded such that
1 = `definitely not a hoax', 2 = `probably not a hoax', 3 =
`probably is a hoax', and 4 = `definitely a hoax', which
were then recoded to 0­1.8 1174 (807 Democrats, 367
Republicans) respondents were assigned to the GW condi-
tion and 1142 (809 Democrats, 333 Republicans) were
assigned to the CC condition.
Explanatory variables
The primary explanatory variables of interest are party
identification and generalized trust. For party identifica-
tion, the standard seven-point partisanship measure was
recoded into a Republican dummy variable with `leaners'
coded as partisans (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat; pure
Independents were dropped from the analyses).
The trust index is an average of responses to four ques-
tions (coded on four-point scale ranging from 0­1 such
that higher numbers equal greater trust) which assessed
how much of the time respondents thought that (1) the fed-
eral government, (2) law enforcement, (3) the media and
(4) people in general can be trusted to do what is right
(alpha = 0.58).9
To isolate the effects of trust, analyses below control for
the following (all coded to range from 0­1): political
knowledge, authoritarianism, efficacy, need for cognition,
need for evaluation, assessment of federal power, religios-
ity, education, income, gender, age, ethnicity/race and the
Big Five.10
Results11
Using OLS, I estimated the two-way interaction between
party identification and trust to test H1 (that the party iden-
tification effect on AGW hoax belief will be moderated by
generalized trust, regardless of question framing). The
interaction is positive and statistically significant (b =
-0.35, se = 0.10; see Model 1 in Table 1). Figure 1 displays
the shape of the interaction. Consistent with H1, general-
ized trust is negatively associated with hoax beliefs among
Republicans (b = -0.39, se = 0.09) and is not associated
with hoax beliefs among Democrats (b = -0.04, se = 0.04,
owing to a floor effect on hoax beliefs). Generalized trust
moderates AGW hoax beliefs among Republicans.
Model 2 in Table 1 reports the test of H2 (that for
Republicans, trust will have a larger negative effect on the
belief that CC is a hoax than the belief that GW is a hoax.
For Democrats, trust will have either a flat or negative
effect on both the CC and GW question frames). The inter-
action between party identification, trust, and question
frame is positive and statistically significant (b = 0.47, se
= 0.20). The shape of the interaction confirms H2 (see
Figure 2).12 Among Democrats the trust slopes for GW and
CC hoax frame are both negative and not statistically
significantly different from one another (b = -0.03,
se = 0.06 for the `trust x question'frame interaction among
Democrats). Among Republicans, the effect of trust on
belief that CC is a hoax is negative and quite large (b =
-0.61, se = 0.12);13 the predicted value on the CC hoax
question drops from 0.61 to near 0 when moving across the
full range of the trust scale. In contrast, the trust effect on
GW hoax beliefs among Republicans is negative, but not
statistically significant (b = -0.13, se = 0.14). The two
trust slopes are statistically significantly different, one
from the another (b = 0.49, se = 0.18 for the `trust x ques-
tion' frame interaction among Republicans). In the case of
CC, which sounds less threatening and less severe than
global warming, trust mitigates hoax beliefs. In contrast, in
the case of GW, where the implications of belief have
much more unpleasant policy consequences, motivated
reasoning `wins out', and trust does not mitigate conspir-
acy endorsement among Republicans.14
To clarify these differences further, Figure 3 shows the
differential (GW minus CC) between the effect of trust
between the two frames across partisans. Figure 3 demon-
strates a completely flat, insignificant finding for Democrats
across the experimental conditions, while showing a
decrease of -0.15 (se = 0.08) in endorsement among low
trust Republicans when the GW frame is used instead of the
CC frame. Among high trust Republicans, an increase of
0.33 (se = 0.11) in endorsement results when the GW frame
is used instead of the CC frame.
Discussion
To summarize, I argue that the strategic framing choices
made by Republican elites rely on the motivated reasoning
of their partisans to reinforce and perpetuate the belief that
AGW is a hoax. Under the conditions that activate moti-
vated reasoning, it is likely that it has become more and
more difficult for Republican voters to support policies that
(and candidates who) would take steps to address the AGW
issue. Moreover, I find that trust moderates AGW hoax
beliefs among Republicans, but only under the less iden-
tity-threatening CC frame.
Saunders 5
With regard to CT beliefs in general, these findings raise
an interesting proposition: perhaps identity threat is a key
to understanding the conditions under which motivated CT
belief are going to be the strongest, and when factors such
as trust may mitigate such beliefs. Research on the anteced-
ents of CT beliefs has yet to address systematically the
impact of the ways in which CTs vary (e.g., the number of
people involved, the time horizon for the conspiracy,
whether the theorized conspiracy is with regard to a dis-
crete event or is more wide-ranging) on the strength and
persistence of endorsement (but see Grimes, 2016; and
Keeley, 1999). The research reported here suggests that the
degree to which a CT implicates people's attitudes and/or
identities may affect the motivation to believe the CT in
general, and the ways in which variables such as trust mod-
erate such beliefs. With regard to AGW CT beliefs in par-
ticular, as discussed more extensively above, these findings
reinforce the existing evidence that partisans' beliefs are
strongly affected by elite cues on this issue ­ the frames
that Republican elites use to talk about GW/CC matter.
The findings about trust presented here also offer a
potential path to reconciling conflicting findings (e.g.,
Dunlap, 2014; Schuldt et al., 2011, Schuldt et al., 2015)
about whether or not the CC versus GW frame conditions
the effect of partisanship (Democrat versus Republican) on
belief in the existence of AGW. Whereas Schuldt and col-
leagues (2011; 2015) found that the partisan gap in exist-
ence beliefs is larger for the GW than the CC frame, Dunlap
(2014) found no impact of the GW/CC frames. None of
those studies took trust into account as a potential modera-
tor of beliefs; perhaps, if they had, their results might have
been more consistent across the studies. Future research
should explore whether the evidence of trust effects noted

here, with regard to belief in conspiracy theories, general-
ize to questions about the existence of AGW that do not
explicitly raise the spectre of conspiracy.
In conclusion, for those looking for ways to persuade
those who believe in the extremely cynical scenario that
AGW is a hoax to think otherwise, attempts to increase
trust combined with strategic use of the climate change
frame are likely to be most fruitful. However, given the
recent notable declines in trust in our institutions and others
(Hetherington and Rudolph, 2015), the prospects for
increasing trust appear quite dim. Conversely, for those
looking for ways to reinforce beliefs that AGW is a con-
spiratorial hoax and/or persuade others to follow their
cause, the prescription is simpler, if not more harrowing.
Hetherington and Rudolph (2015) showed that political dis-
trust in the electorate and between partisan elites had con-
strained the policy options available to legislators in our
polarized political environment. As such, there is no need
to attack AGW head on in order to accomplish the goals of
subverting pro-AGW policy attitudes in the electorate;
undermining trust and facilitating partisan motivated rea-
soning (through the strategic use of the GW frame) should
be sufficient. Furthermore, the tendency for people to seek
out information that confirms their predispositions means
that they rarely venture outside of their ideological echo
chambers (Feldman et al., 2014). Thus, CTs (such as that
AGW is a hoax) have a self-reinforcing quality. As such,
much of the research on the antecedents and consequences
of CT endorsement leads to the unfortunate conclusion that
these beliefs are close to intractable and may only be
responsive to Republican elite persuasion, and barring that,
life experience and the observation of ecological tragedy.

Notes
 1. CTs are typically defined as `an effort to explain some event
or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful
people, who attempt to conceal their role' (Sunstein and
Vermeule, 2009: 205), or a `secret arrangement between two
or more actors to usurp political or economic power, vio-
late established rights, hoard vital secrets, or unlawfully alter
government institutions' (Uscinski and Parent, 2014: 31).
Believing that AGW is a `hoax' fits the conceptual defini-
tion of a CT, because perpetrating a hoax (i.e., a deliberate
falsehood) of this magnitude requires the coordinated, secret
efforts of a large group of powerful people.
2. Republicans indicate a much greater belief that AGW is a
hoax than Democrats (36% of Republicans endorse the state-
ment that GW/CC is either `probably a hoax' or `definitely a
hoax', whereas only 4% of Democrats did so.) ­ see Online
Appendix A.
3. Republicans are more likely to believe that GW is a hoax
than that CC is a hoax (38% vs 34%); there is little differ-
ence in hoax beliefs between the GW and CC frames for
Democrats ­ see Online Appendix A.
 4. The extent of suspension of disbelief required to endorse a
particular CT varies across the population of CTs (keeping
in mind that some small proportion of CTs do turn out to be
true).
 5. The level of cognitive effort one might put into `mustering
up' evidence could vary from a low-effort `is this believ-
able?' heuristic to a more effortful, cognitive weighing of
arguments for and against.
 6. This hypothesis (and H2) conceptualizes trust differently than
does the framing literature. In that literature, trust is often
measured by source credibility (e.g., Druckman, 2001). Here,
given that my experiment does not mention the source of the
CT, I take my cue from Miller et al. (2016), who argued (and
found) that belief in CTs in general is likely to be moderated
by generalized trust in people, institutions and the media.
 7. Miller et al. (2016) did not account for the possible variation
in identity threat across the CTs they used in their indices/
analyses. If they had, I suspect that trust would have miti-
gated belief in low identity threat CTs to a greater extent than
high identity threat CTs.
 8. This question is in line with the way CTs have been measured
in the literature. Oliver and Wood (2014) asked respondents
to indicate how much they agreed or disagreed with each CT.
The 2012 American National Election Study (ANES) asks,
for example,
Some people say that when Hurricane Katrina hit the
Gulf Coast in the summer of 2005, the federal gov-
ernment intentionally breached flood levees in New
Orleans so that poor neighborhoods would be flooded
and middle class neighborhoods would be spared. Do
you think the federal government definitely did this,
probably did this, probably did not do this, or definitely
did not do this?
To avoid acquiescence bias (Krosnick, 1991), and to avoid
bias due to unbalanced questions (Schuman and Presser,
1991), I adapted the ANES measure to include both sides of
the spectrum.
8 Research and Politics 
 9. It is unfortunate that this survey did not include a measure
of trust in scientists. But, given the documented differences
between Democrats and Republicans in trust in scientists
(e.g., Bolsen et al. 2015), I suspect that there would be too
little variance among the partisan groups to provide a clear
test of a moderation hypothesis.

11. Descriptive statistics of the belief that CC and GW are
hoaxes, as well as of the partisan differences on those beliefs,
appear in Online Appendix A.
12. I report the OLS results rather than ordered logit here because
the OLS estimates are more intuitive and require less space
to elaborate. The ordered logit results (which are consistent
with the OLS results) appear in Online Appendix C, along
with additional robustness checks.
13. Simple slopes are presented here in Figure 2 to decompose
the three-way interaction between question frame, parti-
sanship and trust; marginal effects plots appear in Online
Appendix F (as Figure 10).
14. I ran the moderating interactions from both Model 1 and Model
2 in Table 1 through a diagnostic tool called Interflex on Stata
(Hainmuller et al., 2016, Brambor et al., 2006); the manual
and installation guide can be found here: http://yiqingxu.org/
software/interaction/StataGuide.pdf). The Interflex software
facilitates the estimation of the conditional marginal effect
of a treatment on an outcome variable across terciles of a
moderator as well as the presentation of conventional linear
marginal effects. All of the interactions in this manuscript
returned p-values for their respective Wald tests greater than
0.3, meaning that linear extrapolation is appropriate across
the moderator for all of the models reported here (see Online
Appendix D for more details).
