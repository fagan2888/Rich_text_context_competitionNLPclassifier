Abstract
Objective: To investigate the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and sex, and asthma-
like disease and current wheeze in Han children in Nanjing, China.
Methods: Han children aged 3­14 years were recruited. Height and weight were measured;
individuals were classified into obesity, thinness and normal-weight groups on the basis of the
calculated BMI. Questionnaires were used to measure prevalence of asthma-like disease and
current wheeze. Results were evaluated using the 2-test, odds ratios with 95% confidence
intervals and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
Results: In total 12 092 children (6 331 boys and 5 761 girls) were included. Rates of normal
weight, obesity and thinness were 8915/12 092 (73.73%), 1479/12 092 (12.23%) and 1698/12 092
(14.04%), respectively. Asthma-like disease and current wheeze were reported in 2051/12 092
(16.96%) and 400/12 092 (3.31%), respectively. An increased BMI was associated with a greater risk
of asthma-like disease; this relationship was strongest in girls. Current wheeze was associated
positively with obesity and negatively with thinness, but only among boys. Boys had a greater risk of
asthma-like disease and current wheeze than girls.
Conclusions: BMI and sex were associated independently with the prevalence of asthma-like
disease and current wheeze in Han Chinese children.

Introduction
Asthma is a major cause of chronic morbid-
ity and mortality throughout the world and
its prevalence has increased considerably
over the past 20 years, especially in chil-
dren.1 In recent decades there has also been
a substantial increase in the prevalence of
obesity among children.2 A number of
studies have shown that obesity is an
important risk factor for asthma and
wheeze. A study carried out in the USA
found that the risk of obese children having
asthma was two times higher than for chil-
dren with normal body weight.3 An Asian
study by the Prediction of Allergies in
Taiwanese Children (PATCH) group, invol-
ving 5 476 children showed that an elevated
body mass index (BMI), was associated with
a greater prevalence of wheezing and
eczema.4 In many studies, especially those
based in the USA, the term `overweight/
obese' has usually been defined as the 95th
centile of the US Center for Disease Control
reference curves for BMI, with children at or
above the 85th (but below the 95th) centile
classified as being at risk.5 The prevalence of
asthma in the USA has been reported to be
higher than in many other countries.6
Furthermore, in a US study in children
from racial minority subgroups with differ-
ent genetic backgrounds, obesity prevalence
ranged from 4.4% in Asian Indian children
up to 13.0% in American Indian/Alaska
Native children.7 Therefore, it is important
for such surveys to take ethnicity into
account. A number of studies investigating
the relationship between the incidence of
asthma or asthma-like symptoms and
increasing BMI have included information
on individuals' sex.3,4,6­8 Nevertheless, there
is still a need for further studies that include
these key factors and involve large numbers
of individuals.
The present large population study aimed
to investigate whether BMI and sex are
associated with the prevalence of asthma-
like disease and current wheeze, in children
from the Han ethnic group in Nanjing,
China.
Subjects and methods
Every child belonging to the Han ethnic
group from 16 kindergartens and 12 elem-
entary schools, covering the age range 3­14
years old, in the northern part of Nanjing
City, China, was selected to participate in
the study. Data collection took place
between August 2010 and January 2011.
Children with major systemic diseases or
syndromes were excluded.
The children's parents completed a set of
questions derived from the International
Study of Asthma and Allergies in
Childhood (ISAAC) core questionnaire.9
The ISAAC is a well-validated standard
tool for epidemiological investigation of
the prevalence and severity of atopic dis-
orders, such as wheezing and rhinitis, for use
in children living in different countries.10,11
In the present study, the presence of asthma-
like disease was based on a positive response
to the question, `Has your child ever been
diagnosed with asthma, asthmatic bron-
chitis, chronic bronchitis or asthmatic pneu-
monia?'. The presence of current wheeze was
based on a positive response to the question
on asthma-like disease, plus a positive
response to the question, `In the last
12 months, has your child had wheezing in
the chest?'. The questionnaire also gathered
140 Journal of International Medical Research 43(1)
information on birth date, sex, height,
weight, home address, and a history of
asthma or other allergic disorders in the
parents and grandparents. The date on
which the questionnaire was completed
was recorded for each individual.
All the parents provided verbal informed
consent and anonymity was preserved in the
data analysis. The study was approved by
the Committee on Human Experimentation,
Nanjing Children's Hospital, Nanjing
Medical University, Nanjing, China, and
was conducted in accordance with the
Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in
2013.12
The weight and height of each participant
were measured according to a standard
protocol. All children were weighed while
wearing light clothes and without shoes.
Measurements were conducted using a cali-
brated weighing scale and stadiometer.
Weight (in kg) was measured to the nearest
1 kg and height (in cm) was measured to the
nearest 1 cm. The BMI for each study par-
ticipant (defined as weight in kg divided by
height in m2), was calculated from these
measurements.
The study population was divided
according to age (<7 years versus !7
years) and sex. Participants were also
divided into three groups according to
BMI, based on age- and sex-specific criteria
for normal weight, obesity13 and thinness,14
using well-validated standards developed on
the basis of worldwide surveys.15,16
Statistical analyses
The prevalence of asthma-like disease and
current wheeze in the different BMI and sex
groups were compared using the 2-test.
Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI) were derived in the different BMI,
sex and age groups. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis was performed to esti-
mate the effects of BMI, sex and age inde-
pendently; the confounding factor of BMI
was treated as ranked data, whereas sex and
age were treated as dichotomous data. A
P-value <0.05 was considered to be statis-
tically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSSÕ software, ver-
sion 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
A total of 12 110 children were recruited to
the study. Eighteen questionnaires were
incomplete; therefore data from 12 092 par-
ticipants were available for statistical ana-
lysis. Of these, 6 331 participants were male
and 5 761 were female, with a mean Æ SD age
of 8.24 Æ 2.99 years and 8.21 Æ 3.01 years,
respectively; this difference was not statis-
tically significant. Prevalence rates of
obesity, thinness, asthma-like disease and
current wheeze are shown in Table 1.
BMI
Of the 2 051 children with asthma-like dis-
ease, 292 (14%) were in the obesity group.

In contrast, of the 10 041 children who did
not have asthma-like disease, only 1 187
(12%) were obese. This difference was stat-
istically significant (P ¼ 0.002). A similar
difference was observed when comparing
obesity rates in those with and without
current wheeze. Of the 400 children with
current wheeze, 63 (16%) were in the obesity
group, whereas only 1 416 (12%) of the 11
692 children who did not have current
wheeze were obese (P ¼ 0.029).
The prevalences of asthma-like disease
and current wheeze in the obesity and
thinness groups were compared with that
in the normal-weight group using OR
(Table 2). The overall risk of asthma-like
disease in obese children was significantly
higher than that in normal-weight children
(P < 0.05). There was no statistically signifi-
cant difference in the overall risk of current
wheeze between the different BMI groups.
However, when considered according to sex,
the increased risk of asthma-like disease in
obese children was only statistically signifi-
cant in female subjects (P < 0.05). In add-
ition, the risk of current wheeze was
significantly higher in the obesity group
and significantly lower in the thinness
group compared with the normal-weight
group in male subjects only (P < 0.05 for
both) (Table 2). On interaction analysis, the
effect of BMI on the prevalence of current
wheeze was different between sexes (OR
0.624, 95% CI 0.404, 0.964, P ¼ 0.034).
Sex
The overall prevalence of asthma-like dis-
ease and current wheeze were compared
between the sexes, using OR. The risk of
asthma-like disease was significantly higher
in male subjects than in female subjects (OR
1.284, 95% CI 1.167, 1.414, P < 0.001).
Likewise, a significantly higher risk of cur-
rent wheeze was observed in male, compared
with female, subjects (OR 2.202, 95% CI
1.772, 2.737, P < 0.001).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was
conducted to assess the effects of BMI, sex
and age on asthma-like disease and current
wheeze, independently (Table 3). After

controlling for age and sex, the risk of
asthma-like disease among obese individuals
was 0.242 higher than in those of normal
weight (P ¼ 0.001). After adjusting for BMI
and age, male subjects had a significantly
higher risk for asthma-like disease than
female subjects (P < 0.001). For current
wheeze, an increase in BMI was associated
with an increase in risk (P ¼ 0.005 for both
obesity and thinness compared with normal
weight). In addition, the risk of current
wheeze in children !7 years was lower
than that in younger children (P < 0.05)
and was lower in female, than in male,
subjects (P < 0.05).
Discussion
The present study revealed a significant
relationship between asthma-like disease
and obesity among children from the Han
ethnic group in Nanjing, China.
Both 2-test and multivariate logistic
regression analyses showed that an increas-
ing BMI was significantly and independently
associated with a higher prevalence of
asthma-like disease in children. While a
number of studies have shown that asthma
or asthma-like symptoms were significantly
more frequent among obese children,4,17­19
the associated OR have varied. Interaction
analysis of BMI and sex suggested that the
effect of BMI on asthma-like disease does
not differ between the sexes. This is in line
with some reports,20 but some studies have
revealed a stronger association between
BMI and asthma-like disease in boys than
in girls3,8 or conversely a stronger associ-
ation in girls than in boyssubjects.18,21,22
Reported differences between the sexes in
the effect of body size on asthma suggest it is
important to specify the age at which an
effect is observed, as some associations may
only be seen during certain periods of
development.23 The present study also
demonstrated a significant association
between BMI and current wheeze, but only
in boys.
While the epidemiological evidence link-
ing asthma or asthma-like symptoms and
obesity is impressive, the mechanism of the
link between these diseases is far from clear.
Since variations in this association are seen
in results from different areas and ethnic
groups,3,4,10,21 it has been proposed that
asthma and obesity may be linked via spe-
cific regions of the human genome, such as
chromosomes 5q and 6p21.24 It is thought

that interactions between genetic and envir-
onmental factors may be important.24 In
addition, it has been suggested that mech-
anical factors such as the functional residual
capacity of the lung (which is lower in obese
subjects), breathing patterns (obese subjects
have a higher breathing rate and a lower
tidal volume) and alterations in smooth-
muscle structure and function may also play
a role.18
Adipose tissue is not a passive energy
storage depot;25 it has been shown that
obesity affects the immune system and pro-
motes inflammation, which could poten-
tially promote the development of a variety
of chronic conditions and diseases.26
Furthermore, it has been reported that the
cellular and signalling networks linked to
the immune system undergo changes in lean
individuals, and activated macrophages and
eosinophils have been found in adipose
tissues.27 Changes in macrophage function
have been reported in organs other than
adipose tissue, which could contribute to the
development of steatohepatitis.27 In add-
ition, studies have suggested that alveolar
macrophage function may be altered in
obesity.25
The results of the present study indicated
that boys were more likely than girls to
suffer from current wheeze, which is con-
sistent with the results of previous studies.8
This may be due to a higher degree of
physical activity among boys, leading to a
greater likelihood of discovering their symp-
toms.28 The hormone oestrogen may also
play a role in the sex difference.24
In conclusion, the present study, which
had a high participation rate and used the
well-validated ISAAC criteria, showed that
an increase in BMI was associated with an
increased risk of asthma-like disease in Han
children from Nanjing, China. In addition,
sex may also play a role in the presence of
current wheeze. Knowledge of this associ-
ation may help inform public health deci-
sions concerning asthma diagnosis,
management and prevention. However,
because of the cross-sectional design of the
study, and since only sex and age were used
as confounding factors, a causal association
cannot be assumed on the basis of the
present study. Additional investigations are
needed to gain further insight into the
underlying mechanisms.
