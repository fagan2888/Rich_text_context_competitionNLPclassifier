THE NATIONAL HEALTH AND NU-
trition Examination Survey
(NHANES) provides the oppor-
tunity to track trends in the
prevalenceofobesityintheUnitedStates
by collecting data on height and weight
measurements. Data from 1988-1994
showed that the prevalence of obesity in
adults had increased by approximately
8 percentage points in the United States
since 1976-1980, after being relatively
stable over the period 1960-1980.1,2
Analysesofdatafrom1999-2000showed
further increases in obesity for both men
and women and in all age groups.3
The increases in obesity from 1976-
1980 to 1988-1994 were statistically sig-
nificant in all sex and age groups. The
increases in obesity from 1988-1994 to
1999-2000 were statistically signifi-
cant in all sex and age groups except
men aged 40 to 59 years. Analyses of
data from 2001-2002 and 2003-2004
suggested increasing trends since 1999-
2000 among men but not among wom-
en.4,5 Comparisons between 2003-
2004 and 2005-2006 showed no
significant changes but had limited sta-
tistical power.6
Herein we report the results from the
latest NHANES data from 2007-2008
regarding population trends in obe-
sity and compare the results over the
10-year period from 1999 through
2008.
METHODS
The NHANES program of the National
CenterforHealthStatistics,Centersfor
DiseaseControlandPrevention,includes
aseriesofcross-sectional,nationallyrep-
resentativehealthexaminationsurveys
beginning in 1960. To obtain a nation-
ally representative sample of the US
civiliannoninstitutionalizedpopulation,
each survey period used a complex,
stratified,multistageprobabilitycluster
sampling design. Beginning in 1999,
NHANES became a continuous survey
(without a break between cycles) and
dataarereleasedin2-yearcycles,includ-
ing1999-2000,2001-2002,2003-2004,
2005-2006, and 2007-2008.
In 2007-2008, the sample consisted
of 8082 men and women aged 20 years
or older; of whom 73.4% (n=5935)
were interviewed and 70.6% (n=5707)
were both interviewed and examined.
Participants missing weight or height
measurements (n=95) and pregnant
women (n=57) were excluded from the
analyses. This report uses data for 2750
adult men and 2805 nonpregnant adult
women with measured weights and

Context The prevalence of obesity increased in the United States between 1976-
1980 and 1988-1994 and again between 1988-1994 and 1999-2000.
Objective To examine trends in obesity from 1999 through 2008 and the current
prevalence of obesity and overweight for 2007-2008.
Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of height and weight measurements
from 5555 adult men and women aged 20 years or older obtained in 2007-2008 as
part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally
representative sample of the US population. Data from the NHANES obtained in 2007-
2008 were compared with results obtained from 1999 through 2006.
Main Outcome Measure Estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity
in adults. Overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 29.9. Obe-
sity was defined as a BMI of 30.0 or higher.
Results In 2007-2008, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 33.8% (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 31.6%-36.0%) overall, 32.2% (95% CI, 29.5%-35.0%) among
men, and 35.5% (95% CI, 33.2%-37.7%) among women. The corresponding preva-
lence estimates for overweight and obesity combined (BMI 25) were 68.0% (95%
CI, 66.3%-69.8%), 72.3% (95% CI, 70.4%-74.1%), and 64.1% (95% CI, 61.3%-
66.9%). Obesity prevalence varied by age group and by racial and ethnic group for
both men and women. Over the 10-year period, obesity showed no significant trend
among women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for 2007-2008 vs 1999-2000, 1.12 [95%
CI, 0.89-1.32]). For men, there was a significant linear trend (AOR for 2007-2008 vs
1999-2000, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.12-1.58]); however, the 3 most recent data points did
not differ significantly from each other.
Conclusions In 2007-2008, the prevalence of obesity was 32.2% among adult men
and 35.5% among adult women. The increases in the prevalence of obesity previ-
ously observed do not appear to be continuing at the same rate over the past 10 years,
particularly for women and possibly for men.

heights from the most recent 2 years
of the continuous NHANES 2007-
2008, in addition to data from NHANES
1999-2006. NHANES 1999-2008
received approval from the National
Center for Health Statistics research
ethics review board. Written in-
formed consent was obtained.
Weight and height were measured in
a mobile examination center using stan-
dardized techniques and equipment.
Body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared, rounded to
the nearest tenth. For adults aged 20
years or older, overweight was de-
fined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 and obe-
sity was defined as a BMI of 30.0 or
higher.7 Obesity may be divided into
grade 1 (BMI, 30-35), grade 2 (BMI,
35-40), and grade 3 (BMI 40).8

COMMENT
TheprevalenceofobesityintheUnited
States continues to be high, exceeding
30% in most sex and age groups. Com-
parisonsbetweenCanadaandtheUnited
Statesshowthatobesityprevalencewas

encelargelyduetohigherobesitypreva-
lenceamongwomen.10 Comparisonsof
obesityprevalencebetweenCanadaand

adults show no significant differences
for men.10 A review of prevalence esti-
matesinEuropeancountriesfoundthat
theprevalenceofobesitybasedonmea-
suredweightsandheightsvarieswidely
from country to country, with higher
prevalences in Central, Eastern, and
Southern Europe.11 In most cases, the
prevalenceofobesityappearedlowerin
European countries than in the United
States. However, estimates from other
countries are not precisely comparable
withUSestimatesbecauseofdifferences
instudymethods,yearsofmeasurement
and the age ranges, and methods of age
adjustment or age categorization.
The prevalence of obesity shows sig-
nificant variation by racial and ethnic
groups. Racial and ethnic differences in
theprevalenceofobesityasdefinedbyBMI
shouldbeinterpretedcautiouslybecause
theydonotnecessarilycorrespondtodif-
ferencesinfatmassorpercentageofbody

ever,BMIdoesnotdistinguishfatandlean

The relative, although not absolute,

however, this theory has been dis-
puted.21 Considerablediscussion22-24 has
addressed the public health and policy
issuesofusingdifferentBMIcutoffpoints

ferent relationships with BMI, body fat,
and health risks.
Forwomen,theprevalenceofobesity
showednostatisticallysignificantchanges
overthe10-yearperiodfrom1999through
2008.Formen,therewasasignificantlin-
ear trend over the same period, but esti-
mates for the period 2003-2004, 2005-
2006, and 2007-2008 did not differ sig-
nificantly from each other. These data
suggestthattheincreasesintheprevalence
of obesity previously observed between
1976-1980and1988-19941,3 andbetween
1988-1994 and 1999-20003 may not be
continuingatasimilarleveloverthepe-
riod1999-2008,particularlyforwomen
but possibly for men.
The prevalence of obesity for adults
aged 20 to 74 years increased by 7.9 per-
centage points for men and by 8.9 per-
centagepointsforwomenbetween1976-
1980 and 1988-1994, and subsequently
by 7.1 percentage points for men and by
8.1 percentage points for women be-
tween1988-1994and1999-2000.1 Ifthe
trends between 1988-1994 and 1999-
2000 continued at approximately the
same annual level, an increase of 6 to 7
percentage points between 1999-2000
and 2008-2009 would be expected for
both men and women. The sample size
was sufficient to detect a linear increase
of this magnitude with 90% power. Be-
tween 1999-2000 and 2007-2008, there
was an increase of 4.7 percentage points
(95% CI, 0.5 to 9.0) for men and a non-
significant increase of 2.1 percentage
points (95% CI, -2.1 to 6.3) for women.

1960-1980 (covered by the earliest
NHANESsurveysandtheNationalHealth
ExaminationSurvey),obesityprevalence
was relatively stable, but then it showed
strikingincreasesinthe1980sand1990s.
The data presented in our current study
using 2007-2008 data suggest that the

This study has several limitations.
These data were obtained from a sample
survey and like other survey data, they
may be subject to sampling error or
nonsampling error. In addition, the
power of this study is limited to detect
small changes in prevalence, particu-
larly among subgroups defined by sex,
age, and racial and ethnic group.
Obesity is a risk factor for a variety of
chronicconditionsincludingdiabetes,hy-
pertension,highcholesterol,stroke,heart
disease, certain cancers, and arthritis.26
Higher grades of obesity are associated
withexcessmortality,primarilyfromcar-
diovasculardisease,diabetes,andcertain
cancers.26-28 Trends in obesity-related
health outcomes do not always parallel
