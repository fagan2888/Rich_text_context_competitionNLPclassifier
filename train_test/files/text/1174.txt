Background. The marked racial disparity in sexually transmit-
ted infection (STI) rates in the United States remains inade-
quately explained. One important factor may be concurrent
sexual partnerships (relationships that overlap in time), which
can transmit STIs more rapidly through a population than does
sequential monogamy.
Methods. To determine prevalence, distribution, and corre-
lates of U.S. women's involvement in concurrent partnerships,
we analyzed sexual partnership data reported by the 10,847
women, age 15­44 years, in the 1995 National Survey of
Family Growth. Overlapping sexual partnership dates were
determined by computer program and visual review of the data.
Results. Prevalence of concurrent partnerships since January
1991 was 12% overall. Prevalence was lowest among currently
married respondents (4%) and highest among those who were
formerly married (22%), never married (19%), in the lowest
income stratum (17%), age 18­24 years when interviewed
(23%), or who first had sexual intercourse at age 12 or 13
(35%). Prevalence was 21% among blacks, 11% among whites,
8% among Hispanics, and 6% among Asian American and
Pacific Islanders. Multiple logistic analysis substantially weak-
ened the relationship between concurrency and black race
(OR  1.2; 95% CI  1.1­1.4).
Conclusions. Marital status in particular is strongly related to
concurrency; thus, lower marriage rates among blacks and the
associated higher concurrency of sexual partners may contrib-
ute to racial disparities in STI rates.

Key words: concurrent partnerships, sexual networks, HIV, sexual behavior, African Americans, sexually transmitted infections.
Throughout much of the United States, rates of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are dra-
matically higher among blacks than whites. The reasons
for these marked racial disparities remain poorly defined.
Sexual networks and patterns of partner mixing play
a critical role in the spread of sexually transmitted in-
fections (STIs) throughout a population.1­6
One pattern that can accelerate the transmission of
STIs is concurrent (overlapping) sexual partnerships.7
Compared with sequential monogamy, concurrent rela-
tionships permit more rapid spread of an STI through a
population because an individual becoming infected by
one partner already has other partners to infect. In
addition, an individual's partners who entered the con-
current partnership earlier are put at risk for infections
from that individual's subsequent partners.8 This is in
contrast to serial monogamy. Mathematical models dem-
onstrate that concurrent partnerships can dramatically
accelerate spread of an STI among partner networks
immediately after the pathogen enters the population.9
Thus, a higher prevalence of concurrent partnerships
among blacks could be a factor in their higher incidence
of heterosexually acquired HIV. We hypothesize that
the prevalence of concurrency is higher among blacks
than among U.S. non-Hispanic whites due to blacks'
much lower marriage prevalence. The lower marriage
prevalence is likely a consequence of their adverse so-
cioeconomic context and much lower sex ratio (ratio of
men to women).10­12

United States. The NSFG is conducted periodically by
the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention to collect data on
factors affecting pregnancy and women's health in the
United States.13 Data collection for Cycle V took place
during January through October 1995. Interviews were
conducted by trained interviewers using computer as-
sisted personal interview technology. To enhance recall
ability for dates, respondents constructed a calendar
showing the month, year, and respondent's age from
birth through the date of the interview of important life
events.
Sample
The sampling frame for the 1995 NSFG consisted of
all 25,534 civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. women
age 15­44 years who lived in 21,168 households that
responded to the 1993 National Health Interview Sur-
vey (NHIS).14 The NSFG sample contained one woman
from each of the 5,341 NHIS households with an ap-
parently eligible Hispanic or black woman and one
woman from each of about 55% of the NHIS households
with eligible women who were neither Hispanic nor
black. The 79% response rate yielded 10,847 completed
cases. Sample weights were computed to adjust for sub-
sampling, nonlocation, and nonresponse, and further
adjusted to match the Census estimates of the U.S.
population by age, race, marital status, and parity.
Weighted analyses yield estimates for the approximately
60,201,000 civilian, non-institutionalized women in the
United States in 1995.14
Dates of Sexual Partnerships
The NSFG interview asked each respondent the
month in which she first had sexual intercourse with:
her first partner, spouse, each man with whom she co-
habited, and any other sexual partners she had since
January 1991. Cohabitation was defined as living with a
man with whom the respondent was having a sexual
relationship; "sexual relationship" in this and other con-
texts was defined as a relationship involving penile-
vaginal intercourse. The month of last sexual intercourse
was also asked for non-marital partners who were not
regarded as "current."
Definition of Concurrent Partnerships
We defined concurrent partnerships as two or more
partnerships that were "current" or where first sexual
intercourse with one partner occurred before the month
of last sexual intercourse with another partner. Partner-
ships that ended by January 1991, the start of the study
period, were ignored. Because the NSFG contains lim-
ited information about the continuity of sexual relations
between dates of first and last sex, we treated all part-
nerships as continuous from the month of first sex to the
month of last sex. For about 15% of the women classified
as "concurrent" (and included in the analyses), their
only concurrent partnership(s) began before January
1991; thus some of these women may have had no actual
overlap in partners during the study period.
Classification Procedure
We operationalized the above definition by using
computer routines to classify partnership histories. To
verify that the computer algorithms were performing
correctly, we inspected the records for 100 women who
had been computer-coded as "concurrent" (99 classifi-
cations were confirmed) and 50 women reporting more
than one partner since January 1991 but computer-
coded as "not concurrent" (49 classifications were con-
firmed). When the month of first sexual intercourse with
a partner was not provided, we substituted (where pos-
sible) the earlier of the month the respondent and her
partner began cohabiting or married. Similarly, when
the month of last intercourse was not available, we used
(when available) the month of final separation, divorce,
or death of the partner, whichever was earliest. If con-
currency status could not be determined due to missing
partnership dates, then the woman was dropped from
concurrency analyses.
Imputation and Visual Review
The problem with the above imputation procedure
was that in a significant number of cases information for
one kind of partnership (eg, spouse) appeared to have
been incorrectly placed in a record location reserved for
another kind of partnership (eg, casual partner), creating
the appearance of two different, overlapping partner-
ships (one missing the month of first and last inter-
course). Imputation in such a situation produces spurious
concurrency. Because 35% of records ultimately classi-
fied as having a concurrent partnership required impu-
tation, we visually reviewed all records where imputa-
tion created an appearance of concurrency. We also
reviewed all records in which two partnerships had iden-
tical start months and end months, as these records
might simply contain the same partnership data entered
twice. In all, over 1,500 observations, including the
majority of those deemed "concurrent," were classified
following visual review.
Analyses with Covariables
We examined the association of concurrent partner-
ships with the following variables: ethnicity, age at in-
terview, education, marital status, lifetime number of
sexual partners, number of partners since January 1991,
age at first voluntary vaginal intercourse, work status,
and receipt of Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC), as well as combined family income from all
sources in the 12 months prior to the survey (as a
EPIDEMIOLOGY May 2002, Vol. 13 No. 3 CONCURRENT SEXUAL PARTNERSHIPS

percent of the 1994 poverty line), which we grouped
into four categories.15 Data on education and income
were used only for women over age 21.13 The 10 Amer-
ican Indians were omitted from analyses that controlled
for ethnicity.
We used stratified analyses and multiple logistic re-
gression models with concurrency as the dependent vari-
able and ethnicity as the "exposure" of primary interest
to assess residual associations, after inclusion of potential
explanatory variables of a priori interest that were asso-
ciated with concurrency. (Poverty, receipt of AFDC,
and education were assessed as indicators of socioeco-
nomic status. Age and marital status are associated with
sexual partner number16; early age of sexual debut is
associated with sexual risk behavior later in life.17) Col-
linearity was not a problem because correlation coeffi-
cients for all pairs of variables used in the same model
were below 0.50, and no principal component had a
variance proportion at or below 0.8 on more than one
variable.18 Neither the estimated coefficients nor the
standard errors were inflated, suggesting absence of nu-
merical problems.19 We examined models with various
subsets of explanatory variables in the complete data set
and in a subset chosen for greater homogeneity (women
age 22 and older, with age at first intercourse between 12
and 24 years, and sexually active for at least 5 years).
Variables with multiple levels (age, age at first inter-
course, education, income) were analyzed as categorical
variables in some models and as continuous variables in
others.
SAS (versions 6.12 and 8.01, SAS Institute, Inc.) was
used for data management and descriptive analyses.
SUDAAN (version 7.5.2, Research Triangle Institute)
was used for statistical analyses to account for the com-
plex sampling design and weighting. Design effects for
prevalence estimates were mostly below 1.5.
Results
Demographic Information
Distributions of ethnicity and other demographic
characteristics of women in the NSFG are shown in
Table 1. Marked, though familiar, ethnic disparities in
poverty are evident: blacks and Hispanics were most
likely to report annual incomes of less than 150% of the
poverty line (41% and 40%, respectively) and to receive
AFDC (23% and 15%, respectively); whites were least
likely to have incomes below 150% of the poverty line
(16%) and to receive AFDC (4%).
Sexual Relationship History
African American women were much less likely to be
married at the time of interview (25%) than were whites
(54%), Hispanics (47%), or Asian Americans or Pacific

Islanders (49%) (Table 2). The differences in percent-
ages across the ethnic groups were essentially unchanged
by the classification of unmarried cohabiting women as
married.
Median age at first sexual intercourse was 16 or 17
years. Black women tended to initiate intercourse earlier
than other groups (38% before age 16); Asian American
and Pacific Islander women were older at first inter-
course (19% before age 16) than white and Hispanic
women.
Black women were more likely than white women to
report having had more than one sex partner (ever):
(79% vs 68%), but only slightly more likely to have had
more than five (32% vs 30%). Hispanic and Asian
American/Pacific Islander women were much less likely
to report having had more than one sex partner.
Concurrency Prevalence
Approximately 12% of women were classified as hav-
ing had concurrent partnerships since January 1991 (Ta-
ble 3). As expected, concurrency prevalence was
strongly associated with number of sexual partners.
Overall, concurrency was much less likely to have oc-
curred among women who were currently married (4%)
and most likely to occur among women who were for-
merly married (22%), had combined family income be-
low 150% of the poverty line (17%), received AFDC
(23%), were age 18­24 years at interview (23%), first
had sexual intercourse at age 12 or 13 (35%), or reported
at least 11 lifetime sexual partners (41%). Among black
women, educational attainment was inversely related to
crude concurrency prevalence, but in other ethnic
groups no association was apparent.
Marked ethnic differences in concurrency were evi-
dent. Concurrency prevalence was highest among black
women (21%), lowest among Asian American and Pa-
cific Islanders (6%) and Hispanics (8%), and interme-
diate among whites (11%). These ethnic patterns per-
sisted in stratified analyses across all variables, except for
women who had been formerly married, where concur-
rency prevalence was the same (24%) among blacks and
whites. Even among women reporting the same number
of partners since January 1991, concurrency prevalence
for black women was considerably higher than for the
other ethnic groups. Concurrency was moderately re-
lated to poverty among black and white women but not
among the other racial/ethnic groups.
Multiple Logistic Analysis
The crude association of concurrency prevalence
with younger age, earlier sexual debut, and being unmar-
ried remained in multiple logistic models, as did the
inverse association with Hispanic ethnicity. Terms for
Asian American ethnicity and black ethnicity were in-
cluded in all models, although the regression coefficient
Asian Americans was small and for blacks it diminished
substantially with the inclusion of marital status and age
at first intercourse. The association of concurrency with

yses in Table 3, became monotonic and only weakly

income and AFDC were apparently explained by other

Discussion
Concurrent sexual partnerships can efficiently spread
HIV and other STIs throughout a population.8,9,20,21 Par-
ticipation in concurrent sexual partnerships has been
associated with increased risk of STI transmission.22­25
Some authors have implicated concurrent partnerships
in the spread of HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa
and other populations with extensive heterosexual HIV
transmission.26­28
To determine the prevalence of concurrency and its
predictors among women in the United States, we ana-
lyzed sexual partnership histories reported in the 1995
NSFG. About 26% of women of reproductive age had
two or more sexual partnerships during the approxi-
mately 54 month-year study period, and 46% of these

women had concurrent partnerships. Substantial ethnic
differences were noted in the crude prevalence of con-
currency, which was most common among black women
(21%), lowest among Asians (6%) and Hispanics (8%),
and intermediate among whites (11%). Concurrency
prevalence was strongly related to age, age at first inter-
course, marital status, and receipt of AFDC, and less
strongly associated with education, income, and work
status. The multiple logistic models suggested that the
relationship with income, work status, and AFDC could
be explained by other variables. Age, age at first inter-
course, and marital status remained strongly associated
with concurrency. Hispanic ethnicity was significantly
inversely associated, and black ethnicity retained at
most a weak residual positive association.
Previous studies of concurrency have dealt with spe-
cial populations, such as adolescents with STD exposure
and college students. Among adolescents at a public
STD clinic in San Francisco who had at least one main
sexual partner during the preceding 6 months, 31%
reported a concurrent partnership during a main rela-
tionship.22 Coital diaries of 82 adolescent females who
either had or were exposed to an STD revealed concur-
rent partnerships among 13% during a 21-month peri-
od.29 A small survey of college students found similar
levels of concurrency among African American (47%)
and white (50%) men but higher prevalences among
white (38%) than African American (19%) women.30
Several studies based on national surveys have docu-
mented reported numbers of sexual partnerships in the
past year,31­35 but the extent of concurrency is unclear.
Among sexually active U.S. women studied in the 1988
NSFG, approximately 3% reported at least two partners
in the previous 3 months.36 In that sample, unmarried
women of all age and ethnic groups were equally likely to
report having multiple partners.35 Given the brevity of
the time span, many of these partnerships are likely to
have overlapped, although concurrency was not specif-
ically examined. In contrast, the current study specifi-
cally examines the prevalence of concurrent partner-
ships and their correlates.
In the United States, explanations for the marked
ethnic disparity in rates of HIV and other STIs have
remained elusive. Causes are likely multifactorial and
include differential access to healthcare, poverty, and
prevalence of infection in the pool of sexual partners.
But a pattern of increased sexual risk behavior (eg,
partner number, condom use, sexual practices) has not
been clearly established for black women. Consistent
with the findings of previous investigations,17,35 our data
showed that similar proportions of black and white
women reported more than five partners during the
preceding 5 years.
In contrast, differences between blacks and whites
have recently been found in the nature of sexual net-
works; among blacks, more sexual mixing occurs be-
tween those with fewer partners and those with many
partners, a pattern that efficiently transmits STIs
throughout a population.37 Our study suggests that con-
current sexual partnerships may represent another net-
work pattern that contributes to the high rates of HIV
and other STIs among blacks in the United States.
Black women's greater prevalence of concurrency is
unlikely to be due to attitudes about sexual relationships,
as some studies report similarity between blacks and
whites in such attitudes.38­40 More likely explanations,
suggested by our analyses, are younger age at sexual
debut and marital status. Nevertheless, the potential role
of these factors as determinants of concurrency does not
diminish the likelihood that concurrency is a determi-
nant of higher STD rates in blacks.
Early age of sexual debut predicts larger partner num-
ber later in life16,41 and has been associated with extra-
marital intercourse among men.42 However, the nature
of the link between concurrency and age of first sexual
intercourse is unclear.
In contrast, the pathway between marital status and
concurrency is more direct. Because marriage usually

constrains sexual interactions with other partners, strong
associations between marital status and numbers of sex-
ual partners are expected. Married persons are far less
likely than those who are unmarried to have had mul-
tiple partners during the past year.16,41 In 1997, only 34%
of African American adults were married and living with
a spouse, a percentage that was substantially lower than
for whites (59%), Asians and Pacific Islanders (57%),
and Hispanics (51%).43,44
A possible explanation for the high percentage of
black women who are unmarried is the relative scarcity
of black men. The low sex ratio (ratio of men to women)
among blacks results largely from higher mortality rates
among black males due to disease, violence, and the
disproportionate incarceration of black men.45 This
"male shortage" depresses marriage rates overall and may
also raise divorce rates. Moreover, men's scarcity affords
them greater opportunity to maintain simultaneous re-
lationships with different women.12 The effect of the low
sex ratio is compounded by economic marginality, a
feature of life for many blacks that has a well-known
deleterious effect on marital stability.46,47
A major strength of this study is its use of a large,
high-quality, nationally representative data set with
oversampling of blacks and Hispanics. A significant lim-
itation, however, is the lack of data on men. This lack
prevented our investigating whether concurrency among
men may be responsible for the apparent anomaly of
Latinos having lower concurrency prevalence than
white women despite having higher STD rates.
Our measure of concurrent sexual partnerships relies
on respondents' self report and their recalling months of
first and last sexual intercourse with various partners
going back nearly 5 years, a cognitively difficult recall
operation,48 although the NSFG did employ several
techniques to improve accuracy of recall. Nevertheless,
our ethnic comparisons would be seriously affected by
recall errors only if the errors were differentially distrib-
uted by ethnicity.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study revealed ethnic differences
among U.S. women of childbearing age in the reported
prevalence of concurrent partnerships. Differences in
marital status and age at first sexual intercourse appeared
to mediate the higher concurrency prevalence among
African Americans. Greater involvement in concurrent
partnerships may play a role in the longstanding ethnic
disparities in rates of HIV and other STIs experienced by
African Americans. Further research should seek to un-
derstand the phenomenon of concurrency in women and
men and the factors that promote this sexual pattern and
discourage long-term monogamy. In particular it is im-
portant to re-assess long-standing national policies re-
garding economics, employment, substance use, and law
enforcement that help destabilize relationships in the
black community.49
