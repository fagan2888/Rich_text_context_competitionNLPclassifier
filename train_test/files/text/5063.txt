Abstract: Mate preferences shift according to contexts such as temporal duration of
mateship sought and ecological prevalence of parasites. One important cross-cultural
context that has not been explored is a country's socioeconomic development. Because
individuals in less developed countries are generally less healthy and possess fewer
resources than those in more developed countries, displays of health and resources in a
prospective long-term partner were hypothesized to be valued more in populations in which
they are rare than in populations in which they are more common. We also predicted
negative correlations between development and preferences for similar religious
background and a desire for children. We found strong support for the health hypothesis
and modest support for the resource acquisition potential hypothesis. We also found an
unpredicted positive correlation between development and importance ratings for love.
Discussion addresses limitations of the current research and highlights directions for future
cross-cultural research on mating psychology.
Keywords: mate preference shifts, cross-cultural, socioeconomic development,

Introduction
Mate preferences are context sensitive, and this context-sensitivity is expected from
an evolutionary psychological perspective (Buss, 2004, for a review). Preferences have
been found to shift as a function of parasite prevalence in the ecology, operational sex ratio,
and other culturally variable factors (Gangestad and Buss, 1993; Stone, Shackelford, and

Socioeconomics and mate preferences
Buss, 2007). Previous research on the context sensitivity of mate preferences indicates that
men and women also place differential importance on certain characteristics in a mate
depending on the temporal context of the desired relationship (Buss and Schmitt, 1993;
Kenrick, Groth, Trost, and Sadalla, 1993; Schmitt and Buss, 1996).
Although sex differences in importance of mate preference characteristics are
frequently predicted and discovered empirically, the effects of culture on mate preferences
are potentially generally greater than those of biological sex (Buss et al., 1990; Gangestad,
Haselton, and Buss, 2006). One variable that may serve as a baseline in comparing
different cultures is a country's level of socioeconomic development. Socioeconomic
development is a variable that cuts across different modes of production, types of
government, and geographic regions to present a broad picture of problems people confront
in daily life across cultures that would otherwise be incomparable. Men and women
evaluating potential partners in different cultures face different problems associated with
socioeconomic development. We therefore expect that men and women may place
differential importance on characteristics in a long-term mate that solve the different
problems encountered by individuals in each context.
Contextual Problem of Finding a Healthy Partner
In general, individuals in more socioeconomically developed countries are healthier
(Marmot, 2005). Therefore, encountering a healthy potential partner is less likely in less
developed countries. We hypothesize that men and women in less developed countries will
rate a potential partner's health as more important than those in more developed countries.
Additional characteristics indicative of good health are predicted to be more important to
both sexes in less developed countries than in more developed countries, including
preferences for refinement/neatness and chastity. Men and women who are more refined
and neat--conceptualized as clean--are more likely to be healthy, relative to individuals
who are less refined and neat. Although the sterile environments of some very developed
nations may yield weakened immune responses, cleanliness (and refinement and neatness)
is far more likely to be related to healthful outcomes than filthiness across a wide range of
cultures. Also, men and women who are chaste, or who have had no previous sex partners,
are much less likely to carry a sexually transmitted disease. In addition, because women are
traditionally associated with the performance of domestic labors, including a characteristic
related to eating and living healthfully--cooking and housekeeping--we predict that only
men will increase importance ratings for a partner who is a good cook and housekeeper in
less developed countries. The sexual division of labor is a feature found universally in
human societies (Brown, 1991), and we mean only to note that these are tasks traditionally
(and throughout cultures universally) adopted by women, and they should be especially
important to men in less developed societies where women are indeed less likely to be in
the workforce (South, 1988).
Hypothesis 1: The importance that men and women place on characteristics indicative
of good health will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic development.
Prediction 1: The importance that men place on a potential partner's health,
refinement/neatness, chastity, and being a good cook and housekeeper will be negatively
correlated with socioeconomic development.
Prediction 2: The importance that women place on a potential partner's health,
refinement/neatness, and chastity, will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic

development.
Contextual Problem of Finding a Partner with Ample Resources
Individuals in less socioeconomically developed countries are less likely to have
access to resources, and so may place particular importance on associated characteristics in
a mate. These characteristics may include good financial prospects, status, ambition and
industriousness, and education and intelligence.
Hypothesis 2: The importance that men and women place on characteristics related
to wealth, including good financial prospects, status, ambition and industriousness, and
education and intelligence, will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic development.
Contextual Problem of Finding a Partner Desirous of Children
Men and women in less developed countries have more children than do men and
women in more developed countries (Aarssen, 2005). This may be because children in less
developed countries are an economic asset to the extent they are able to help the household
with farming or herding, relative to more developed countries in which children may be a
net financial drain. Indeed, parents appear to explicitly perceive the value of children as a
greater net benefit (psychologically as well as economically) in less socioeconomically
developed countries (Kaitçibai, 1982). In addition, life history theorists studying the
demographic transition find that the cost of raising successful, competitive children
negatively affects the optimal family size and positively affects amount of resources
allocated per child (Mace, 2000). Thus, men and women have more children in less
developed countries, and may do so because they perceive children to be a greater net
economic and psychological benefit to the household. In the current research, we
investigate whether a greater valuation of children, as reported in Kaitçibai, extends to
characteristics important in a mate among individuals in less developed countries. And to
the extent that children are a net benefit at the household level, individuals in less
developed countries are predicted to place greater importance on a potential partner's desire
for home and children than men and women in more developed countries.
Hypothesis 3: The importance that men and women place on a potential partner's
desire for home and children will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic
development.
Contextual Problem of Finding a Partner with a Similar Religious Background
Khallad (2005) suggests that religion may be particularly important in the day-to-
day life of people in less developed countries, and some evolutionary psychological
accounts of religion stress that it may function, in part, to allay people's anxieties about
death (Atran, 2002; Atran and Norenzayan, 2004). To the extent that individuals living in a
less socioeconomically developed country experience higher infant mortality, lower life
expectancy, and are less healthy (Marmot, 2005), people are predicted to place greater
importance on religion--and religious similarity in a potential mate--in less developed
countries if indeed religion serves, in part, to allay anxieties about death. We therefore
hypothesize that men and women in less developed countries will place more importance
on finding a partner who shares their religious background.
Hypothesis 4: The importance that men and women place on a potential partner
having a similar religious background will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic
development.

Socioeconomics and mate preferences
We used a descriptive measure of differences between countries--socioeconomic
development--to test hypotheses and derivative predictions of variance in importance
ratings of 18 characteristics in a prospective long-term mate. Although this mate preference
database has been analyzed to produce several articles (e.g., Buss, 1989; Buss et al., 1990),
the current article presents the results of new analyses designed to test different hypotheses
and predictions.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants were 4,499 men and 5,310 women residing in 36 cultures located on six
continents and five islands. Men ranged in age from 17 to 30 years, with a mean age of
23.3 years. Women ranged in age from 17 to 30 years with a mean age of 22.6 years (see
Buss, 1989, for additional details).
Materials and Procedure
The survey used to assess mate preferences was adapted from Hill (1945). In this
survey, participants rate the importance of 18 mate preference characteristics (see Table 1)
on the following 4-point scale: 3 points = indispensable, 2 = important, 1 = desirable, but
not very important, and 0 = irrelevant or unimportant. Instructions were provided to each
collaborator for translating the instrument into the appropriate language for their sample
(see Buss, 1989, for additional details).
We calculated an index of socioeconomic development according to the method
prescribed in South (1988), as he used four common development indicators and found this
measure to strongly mediate women's marital opportunities. We summed standardized
scores for the country's Gross National Product (GNP), infant survival rate, life
expectancy, and the percentage of the population that is urban, and achieved an acceptable
alpha ( = 0.82). Because the mate preference data were collected in the mid-1980s, we
collected socioeconomic development data for a comparable year (i.e., 1985). GNP data
were obtained from the United States Bureau of the Census (2002) for the year 1990, and
remaining demographic data were obtained from the United Nations (2004) for the year
1985. Stone et al. (2007) present each country's calculated Development Index.
Additionally, because Stone et al. found mate preference shifts according to a country's sex
ratio, we controlled for sex ratio in partial-order correlations (see Table 1).
Results
Table 1 presents the zero-order correlations and partial correlations between all of the
18 preference characteristics, including those unrelated to the hypotheses, and the
Development Index. Predictions 1 and 2 of Hypothesis 1 were supported. Importance
ratings of health (p < .01 for men, p < .05 for women) and health-related characteristics,
including refinement/neatness (ps < .01), chastity (ps < .01), and good cook and
housekeeper (for men, p < .001), correlated significantly and negatively with
Developmental Index (see Table 1).

Hypothesis 2 was partially supported: importance ratings for status significantly and
negatively correlated with Development Index for both sexes (p < .01 for men, p < .001 for
women), as did the characteristic education and intelligence for both sexes (ps < .05). As
hypothesized, ambition and industriousness was significantly negatively correlated with
Development Index for men (p < .05), but not for women (although the correlation was
marginally significant, p < .10). Finally, importance ratings for good financial prospects
were not significantly negatively correlated with Development Index (ps > .05), although
these relationships were in the predicted direction for both men and women, and for women
this relationship was marginally significant (p < .10; see Table 1).
Men's and women's importance ratings for desire for home and children correlated
significantly and negatively with Development Index (ps < .05), providing support for
Hypothesis 3 (see Table 1). Hypothesis 4 also was supported: across cultures, importance

ratings for similar religious background correlated significantly and negatively with
Development Index for both men (p < .05) and women (p < .01; see Table 1).
An additional unpredicted significant correlation emerged: men's and women's
importance ratings for the characteristic "mutual attraction--love" correlated significantly
and positively with Development Index (p < .001 for men, p < .01 for women; see Table 1).
Controlling for sex ratio did not result in partial correlations that differed significantly from
the corresponding zero-order correlations (see Table 1; by Fisher's r-to-z transformation;
all zs < 1.50, all ps > .10; analyses available on request).
Discussion
Consistent with Hypothesis 1, men and women in less developed countries placed
greater importance on health and health-related characteristics in a potential long-term
mate. This corroborates the results of previous research indicating a positive relationship
between the prevalence of parasites and the importance that men and women place on
attractiveness in a potential partner (Gangestad and Buss, 1993). Gangestad and Buss found
that wealth may have confounded their results, and additionally, a country's level of
socioeconomic development is a conceptually distinct context from parasite prevalence.
Accordingly, the current investigation of the relationships between importance ratings and
socioeconomic development yielded non-significant results for the characteristic of good
looks. Men's and women's relatively stable preference for attractiveness indicates that,
although health (and healthy behaviors) in a prospective long-term mate is variably
important, the value attached to attractiveness does not shift across this context.
The results partially supported Hypothesis 2: although men's and women's
preferences for a mate with good financial prospects did not change, men and women in
less developed countries rated a potential partner's status and education and intelligence as
more important, relative to ratings provided by individuals in more developed countries.
The failure to find support for a shift in preferences for good financial prospects might be
attributable, in part, to the fact that men and women in less developed countries are less
wealthy, and thus are not able to secure mates who do have good financial prospects. They
might instead place increased importance on related characteristics that are attainable in
potential partners in less developed countries, such as status and education and intelligence,
a speculation corroborated by the current results. In addition, in less developed countries
financial prospects may be less important indicators of resources than the possession of
cows, sheep, and goats, for example, which those in high status may possess. It is worth
noting, however, that the correlation between good financial prospects and Development
Index is in the predicted direction, and is marginally significant for women. Finally, there
were sex-differentiated shifts in preferences for the characteristic ambition and
industriousness--men in less developed countries placed relatively more importance on
this characteristic. This may be somewhat unsurprising, given that in less developed
countries, men need women to work hard and to be industrious in gathering, housework,
hauling firewood and water, and other important domestic tasks.
The results supported Hypothesis 3: men and women in less developed countries
placed greater importance on a potential partner's desire for home and children than did
men and women in more developed countries. These results corroborate the results of
previous research indicating that individuals living in less developed countries perceive a

Socioeconomics and mate preferences
greater benefit from having more children, as they also place more importance on this mate
preference characteristic. These results also suggest that there is a psychological foundation
for cross-cultural variation in family size--manifested in mate preferences--that eschews
explanations concerning a relative lack of contraception in less developed countries.
The results also supported Hypothesis 4, in that men and women in less developed
countries placed greater importance on a potential partner's similar religious background,
than did men and women in more developed countries. These results are consistent with
Khallad's (2005) contention that people in less developed countries place greater
importance on religion than do people in more developed countries. These results also are
broadly consistent with evolutionary psychological arguments that highlight the role of
religion in reducing existential anxieties (Atran, 2002; Atran and Norenzayan, 2004). These
results appear not to be consistent with predictions derived from hypotheses that religious
beliefs are a by-product of other psychological mechanisms that serve no substantive role
in alleviating anxiety (Boyer, 2003).
One unpredicted result emerged: men and women in more developed countries placed
greater importance on "mutual attraction/love" than did individuals in less developed
countries. This cross-cultural shift in importance of mutual attraction/love might reflect
cultural differences in the functions of long-term mating relationships (Smits, Ultee, and
Lammers, 1998). Men and women in less developed countries may perceive long-term
relationships as an economic transaction. In some less developed cultures, for example,
marriages involve a trade between families of cows, sheep, or goats for a valuable mate
(Borgerhoff Mulder, 1988), or the formation of an economic alliance between two extended
families (Hart and Pilling, 1960). In some cultures, such as traditional India, married
couples do not spend much time together, preferring to socialize primarily with members of
their own sex (Buss, 2003). Individuals in more developed countries often have more
latitude for individual choice, and perceive the functions of long-term mateships to include
mutual socializing, companionship, and close emotional commitment (Buss, 2003; Fisher,
2004). The somewhat different functions of long-term mateships in developed versus less
developed cultures may be responsible for the differential emphasis placed on mutual
attraction/love--a hypothesis that awaits additional empirical testing. Future research might
investigate directly cross-cultural differences in perceptions of the functions and benefits of
long-term mateships.
Alternatively, the reported shifts in preferences may not reflect true differences in
mate preference characteristics, but rather a limitation of the study design. Li, Bailey,
Kenrick, and Linsenmeier (2002) proposed a model of mate preferences that includes a
trade-off between necessities and luxuries. This trade-offs model suggests that real
individuals do not possess equal amounts of the characteristics measured in mate
preference studies, but that these characteristics are unevenly distributed. In the real world,
men and women must choose certain characteristics over others. Accordingly, men and
women in more developed countries may not find characteristics related to a potential
partner's health and wealth to be any less important than do individuals in less developed
countries. Rather, men and women might universally consider characteristics of health and
wealth to be necessities, but because men and women in developed countries may take
these characteristics for granted relative to individuals in less developed countries, they
rated them as less important in the current study. Future research investigating cross-
cultural mate preference shifts might profitably assess differences in the necessities and

Socioeconomics and mate preferences
luxuries of mate preferences.
Additionally, we note that, except for the one predicted sex difference in preferences
for healthiness operationalized in preferences for a good cook and housekeeper, we
identified few sex-differentiated mate preference shifts associated with socioeconomic
development. The lack of sex-differentiated shifts according to the context of
socioeconomic development does not contradict previous research documenting sex
differences in mate preference characteristics (e.g., for characteristics indicating access to
resources or social status; Buss, 1989). Indeed, there is no theoretical reason for other sex
differences to shift according to socioeconomic development--for example, women place
relatively more importance than men on indicators of potential resources across this
context, although both sexes place more importance on this characteristic in less developed
countries than do individuals in more developed countries.
Finally, because the nature of this study is correlational, a causal relationship between
these variables cannot be inferred. Future research might investigate other variables that
may be related to cross-cultural shifts in mate preferences, such as differences in women's
economic power, or a country's type of government (see Gangestad, Haselton, and Buss,
2006).
In summary, the results of the current study provide initial support for cross-cultural
mate preference shifts according to differences in socioeconomic development. These shifts
predictably occur in domains related to health, wealth, traditional values related to religion
and the desire for children, as well as love. These findings contribute to a growing body of
evidence that links important ecological, temporal, and cultural contexts with shifts in mate
preferences.
