Original Article
The study of social problems has long suggested that ideo-
logical motivations may fuel "symbolic crusades" (Gusfield
1963) and "moral panics" (Cohen 1972; Critcher et al. 2013;
Goode and Ben-Yehuda 1994), generating mass responses out
of proportion to the underlying problem they aim to address.A
similar approach characterizes constructivist and critical
approaches to criminology (DeKeseredy and Dragiewicz
2014; Garland 2001; Schuilenburg, Garland, and Hall 2016)
as well as the emerging field of critical terrorism studies
(Jackson, Smyth, and Gunning 2009). In this view, security
policies and priorities are not direct reflections of relative
threats to public safety but are mediated by ideological con-
siderations that heighten the risks associated with some forms
of threat and downplay others. With respect to Muslim
extremism, arguably the defining threat of the present era, this
perspective argues that certain government officials, policy
experts, and sectors of the public have exaggerated the scale
of the threat, spending fortunes, instituting mass surveillance,
and demonizing suspect populations as a result (Kundnani
2014; Lustick 2006; J. Mueller 2006; J. Mueller and Stewart
2011, 2016; Stampnitzky 2013).
This article offers a statistical test of this hypothesis by
comparing threat assessments by law enforcement agencies
around the United States as recorded in a survey in the first
half of 2014. The article examines the correlation of these
assessments with the number of cases of Muslim and right-
wing extremism in each jurisdiction over the previous dozen
years and the ideological context of each law enforcement
agency, both in the jurisdiction at large and among law
enforcement officers. The article finds that ideological fac-
tors were associated with the assessment of threats posed by
Muslim extremists but were not associated with the assess-
ment of threats posed by right-wing extremists.
This contrast suggests that concern over Muslim extrem-
ism was ideologically motivated years before Donald Trump
made this issue a central component of his presidential
campaign.

Ideology and Threat Assessment:
Law Enforcement Evaluation of
Muslim and Right-Wing Extremism
Charles Kurzman1, Ahsan Kamal1, and Hajar Yazdiha1
Abstract
Does ideology affect assessment of the threat of violent extremism? A survey of law enforcement agencies in the
United States in 2014 offers a comparison suggesting a small but statistically significant effect: Political attitudes were
correlated with assessment of threats posed by Muslim extremists, and threat assessment was not correlated with the
number of Muslim Americans who had engaged in violent extremism within the agency's jurisdiction. By contrast, the
perceived threat of right-wing terrorism was correlated with the number of incidents of right-wing violence and not
with political attitudes. These findings reflect the context of growing polarization of attitudes toward Muslims in the
United States as well as the challenge of bringing counterterrorism policies into proportion with the actual scale of
violent extremism.

approximately 3,000 people in those attacks seemed to
mark a new era in which relatively small groups of mili-
tants, located anywhere in the world, could cause massive
destruction in the United States. Terrorism, which occu-
pied a relatively minor place in the 2000 National Security
Strategy (Clinton 2000), became the top priority of the 2002
strategy (Bush 2002). A new federal agency was created with
counterterrorism responsibilities (the Transportation Security
Administration), others were combined into a new
Department of Homeland Security whose primary mission
was to prevent terrorism in the United States (U.S. Congress
2002), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) made
terrorism its top priority (R. S. Mueller 2002)--in its previ-
ous strategic plan, terrorism was one of nine top priorities
(FBI 1998).
The scale of the threat was considered massive. Seventeen
months after 9/11, Robert Mueller (2003), director of the
FBI, testified to Congress that "FBI investigations have
revealed militant Islamics [sic] in the US. We strongly sus-
pect that several hundred of these extremists are linked to
al-Qaeda." Estimates such as this justified expenditures of
$50 billion more per year on homeland security than before
9/11 (J. Mueller and Stewart 2011).
A threat on this scale did not materialize. Between 2003
and 2012, the U.S. government averaged 40 indictments per
year for offenses related to international terrorism, of which
8 per year had an al-Qaeda "affiliation or inspiration"
(Department of Justice 2016). Most involved attempts to
travel overseas, not plots targeting the United States; none of
these cases involved coordinated, trained operatives compa-
rable to the 9/11 plotters (Kurzman 2012, 2013, 2014a,
2014b, 2015, 2016a, 2016b, 2017; Kurzman, Schanzer, and
Moosa 2011).
Beginning in 2006, the director of the FBI acknowledged
the reduced threat from al-Qaeda, which "we have made
great strides in disabling." He did not mention or withdraw
his earlier estimate of several hundred al-Qaeda­linked
extremists in the United States, and he did not lower his
assessment of the level of threat from Muslim extremists.
Instead, he said that the threat was "evolving" into "smaller,
more loosely-defined individuals and cells who are not affili-
ated with al Qaeda, but who are inspired by a violent jihadist
message . . . [and] may prove to be as dangerous as groups
like al Qaeda, if not more so" (R. S. Mueller 2006).
This "evolving" threat, "as dangerous as" the threats iden-
tified right after 9/11, "if not more so," became the official
assessment of federal law enforcement agencies. In 2012, for
example, a year when the FBI indicted only 11 people for
offenses related to international terrorism (Department of
Justice 2016) and no attacks were carried out by Muslim
extremists in the United States (Kurzman 2013), R. S.
Mueller(2012)reaffirmedtoCongressthat"Counterterrorism
remains our top priority. . . . The terrorist threat is more
diverse than it was 10 years ago," he explained, and "home-
grown violent extremists . . . are increasingly savvy and
willing to act alone, which makes them difficult to find and
to stop." James Clapper (2012), Director of National
Intelligence, echoed this theme: While al-Qaeda has "weak-
ened significantly," some homegrown violent extremists
(HVE) "have exhibited improved tradecraft and operational
security and increased willingness to consider less sophisti-
cated attacks, which suggests the HVE threat may be evolv-
ing." Janet Napolitano (2012), Secretary of the Department
of Homeland Security (DHS), made a similar point: "While
we have made significant progress, threats from terrorism--
including, but not limited to al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda related
groups--persist and continually evolve, and the demands on
DHS continue to grow."
Federal counterterrorism efforts focused almost exclu-
sively on Muslim extremists rather than other forms of
extremism. The National Strategy for Combating Terrorism
(later renamed the National Strategy for Counterterrorism)
made no mention of any other form of terrorism (White
House 2003, 2006, 2011b). A companion document, a
primer on radicalization dynamics produced by the
National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC 2012:3), noted
explicitly that it "focuses on radicalization inspired by al-
Qa'ida and related groups that target US Muslims. . . .
There are other types of extremists--such as white suprem-
acists and ecoterrorists--who commit violence in this
country and are of concern to law enforcement, but such
extremists are not specifically addressed here" (see also
White House 2011c:2.)
A Control Case: Right-Wing
Extremism
As it happens, one of these other types of extremism--(non-
Muslim) right-wing extremism--generated a comparable
number of fatalities to Muslim extremism and can serve as a
control case to test for ideological influences on threat
assessment.
Right-wing extremism encompasses a variety of ideolo-
gies, including anti-government, sovereign citizen, and
white supremacist movements (Balleck 2014; Caiani, della
Porta, and Wagemann 2012; Goldwag 2012; Zeskind 2009).
The U.S. government has expressed concern about the vio-
lent potential of these movements for many years, espe-
cially after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the deadliest
attack by domestic terrorists in U.S. history. An FBI assess-
ment in 2007 concluded that "Militias and sovereign citi-
zens demonstrated intent to harm and harass federal and
state judges, other officers of the court, and government
employees," although "very few went beyond paper terror-
ism tactics to commit direct acts of violence or terrorism."
Fewer than 350 of the 2,000 agents in the FBI's counterter-
rorism division were assigned to "domestic terrorism" in
2008­2009, the only years for which figures were made
public (FBI 2008:6­18; Department of Justice 2010:43).
(The FBI categorizes almost all extremism by Muslims in
Kurzman et al. 3
the United States as "international terrorism," on the pre-
sumption that it is inspired overseas.)
In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security warned of
a possible upsurge in right-wing extremism (DHS 2009) but
retracted the report and shut down the office that produced it
after complaints from conservatives who believed the report
cast unwarranted suspicion on Americans with conservative
beliefs (Johnson 2012). (Similar complaints by Muslim
Americans about reports on Muslim extremism did not lead
to retractions or offices being shut down.) "The threat is
real," a Department of Justice trainer told local law enforce-
ment officers at a workshop on domestic terrorism in 2014.
"Since 2000, 35 law enforcement officers have been killed in
26 incidents in which at least one of the suspects was a right-
wing criminal extremist" (Harris 2014). The Department of
Justice has offered law enforcement training on right-wing
violence since 1996, soon after the Oklahoma City bombing
(Chermak, Freilich, and Shemtob 2009).
By the start of 2014, when we carried out our survey of
law enforcement agencies, the amount of violence attributed
to right-wing extremists was similar to or greater than vio-
lence attributed to Muslim extremists.1 The Global Terrorism
Database, maintained by the START Center at the University
of Maryland (2016), lists 65 attacks in the United States
associated with right-wing ideologies and 24 attacks by
Muslims between 9/11 and the end of 2013, although right-
wing attacks resulted in fewer fatalities (17 vs. 24).2 The
International Security Program at the New America
Foundation (2016) identified 31 fatalities from "non-jihad-
ist" homegrown extremists and 21 fatalities from "jihadist"
extremists through the end of 2013. The Extremist Crime
Database, a project tracking extremists who have committed
violent crimes (Freilich et al. 2014), identified just over 200
right-wing extremists in the years 2002­2011, as compared
with just over 100 extremists associated with al-Qaeda and
affiliated movements (Chermak and Gruenewald 2015).3
By another count, Muslim extremists accounted for 67
violent plots aimed at targets in the United States between
9/11 and the end of 2013, including 14 attacks and 43 fatal-
ities (Kurzman 2014b). Right-wing extremists accounted
for 66 violent plots over the same period, including 31
attacks and 33 fatalities (Anti-Defamation League 2015).
Using a broader definition that includes hate crimes, Arie
Perliger (2012) of the Combating Terrorism Center at the
U.S. Military Academy counted 3,375 right-wing attacks
in the years 2002­2011, leading to 254 fatalities. (On the
relationship between hate crimes and far-right ideological
violence, see Adamczyk et al. 2014; Dunbar, Blanco, and
Crèvecoeur-MacPhail 2016; Mills, Freilich, and Chermak
forthcoming.)
Neither Muslim nor right-wing violent extremism
accounted for a large proportion of violence in the United
States. More than 190,000 Americans were murdered
between 9/11 and the end of 2013 (FBI 2016); violent
extremism was responsible for less than 1 percent of this
total. (After the survey was conducted, the number of fatali-
ties in the United States caused by Muslim extremists more
than doubled, to a total of 123 between 9/11 and the end of
2016, due in large part to the mass shooting at a nightclub in
Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people, plus the attacker;
Kurzman 2017. The proportion of murders due to violent
extremism remained under 1 percent of the overall toll.)
While the numbers have been relatively small, the compari-
son of Muslim and right-wing extremists provides an oppor-
tunity to identify ideological influences in the assessment of
each form of threat.
Ideological Polarization
The comparison of Muslim and right-wing violent extrem-
ism takes place against a backdrop of increasing ideologi-
cal polarization in the United States (Abramowitz 2010;
Campbell 2016). Although most Americans agree on most
issues (Fiorina 2011), partisan identities manifest them-
selves in a number of hot-button issues that have come to
symbolize our era. One of these issues is the place of Islam
in America. As recently as the fall of 2001, however, that
was not the case.
Six days after 9/11, President George W. Bush visited a
mosque two miles from the White House and delivered a
speech praising Islam and Muslim Americans. "Like the
good folks standing with me, the American people were
appalled and outraged at last Tuesday's attacks. And so were
Muslims all across the world," Bush (2011) said. "The face
of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam
is all about. Islam is peace." As a Christian, Bush was not
especially qualified to interpret the meaning of Islam. But as
a public official who considered Islamic terrorism his num-
ber one priority, Bush did not want the war on terrorism to
be viewed as a war on Islam. In particular, Bush was con-
cerned that vigilante attacks on Muslim Americans would
undermine his administration's efforts to mobilize the
world's Muslims against al-Qaeda and other revolutionary
1In late 2014 and early 2015, after the survey was completed, there
was an uptick in violence attributed to Muslim extremists, although
the scale of violence remained low (Kurzman 2016a).
2After a review of all of the incident descriptions and notes in the
data set, right-wing ideologies were identified by the keywords
abortion, Ku Klux Klan, Minutemen, Nazi, white, supremacist, anti-
government, pro-life, hate, gun, and anti-IRS and by targets includ-
ing reproductive, health, mosque, Obama, liberal, Holocaust, and
Sikh. Muslim extremism was identified by the keywords Muslim,
Arab, Taliban, Islam, Allah, Osama, Nidal, and Palestinan and by
targets including Israel and marathon.

1990­2011 as well as demographic characteristics for the entire
period, the pre-9/11 period, and the post-9/11 period. We estimated
the number of extremists post-9/11 by comparing the percentage
male in each period.

groups. Bush denounced such attacks as illegal and immoral
as well as counterproductive. "Those who feel like they can
intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don't
represent the best of America," Bush stated. "They represent
the worst of humankind, and they should be ashamed of that
kind of behavior." Even as the Bush administration placed
Muslims in the United States under special scrutiny
(Bakalian and Bozorgmehr 2009), officials were careful not
to demonize the community whose assistance they sought in
preventing terrorism.
A series of surveys suggests that most Americans shared
the Bush administration's reluctance to denounce Muslims in
general. One of the most commonly asked items on this sub-
ject was some version of the question, "Is your overall opin-
ion of Muslims very favorable, mostly favorable, mostly
unfavorable, or very unfavorable?" The question is an imper-
fect indicator since it forces people to generalize about an
entire group in a way that may not reflect more complex
judgments, but it has been asked so often in nationally repre-
sentative samples--24 times since 9/11--that it allows for
comparison over time. Unfavorable attitudes toward
Muslims--combining somewhat unfavorable and very unfa-
vorable, when both options were offered--rose from a
median of 24 percent in the first eight surveys after 9/11
(March 2002­April 2008) to a median of 30 percent in the
next 11 surveys (June 2009­August 2012) to a median of 41
percent in the next five surveys (June 2014­June 2016).
These surveys are summarized in Figure 1. (An even steeper
rise is visible in 33 surveys asking about favorable and
unfavorable attitudes toward Islam, where unfavorable
responses outnumber favorable responses beginning in 2006.
The rise in unfavorable attitudes is not so pronounced in 13
surveys asking about favorable and unfavorable attitudes
toward Muslim Americans; Kurzman 2014a.)
The overall rise in unfavorable attitudes toward Muslims
was accompanied by a striking rise in polarization. In sur-
veys for which partisan breakdowns are available, the differ-
ence between Republicans' and Democrats' attitudes toward
Muslims, also shown in Figure 1, rose from a median of 8
percentage points in 2002­2008 (seven surveys) to 20 per-
centage points in 2009­2012 (seven surveys) to 29 percent-
age points in 2014­2016 (four surveys).
This trend toward polarization is not limited to party iden-
tification but is also evident with ideological identification:
The gap between self-identified conservatives and liberals
widened from a median of 11 percentage points in 2002­
2008 (six surveys) to 17 percentage points in 2009­2011
(four surveys), although we have found no survey data using
these categories after that year.
Other data sources tell a similar story of polarization. The
American National Election Studies (ANES) of 2004 and
2012, for example, included a "feeling thermometer" asking
respondents to rate their feeling toward Muslims on a scale
from 0 (very cold and unfavorable) to 100 (very warm and
favorable). The gap in the mean rating of "extremely liberal"
and "extremely conservative" respondents widened from 13
points in 2004 to 22 points in 2012 (ANES 2015). Using a
different metric, sociologists Clem Brooks and Jeff Manza
Figure 1. Americans' unfavorable attitudes toward Muslims since 9/11, by party affiliation.
Kurzman et al. 5
(2013:68, 72, 76, 160) found a growing gap between
Democrats and Republicans over the years 2007­2010 in
positive attitudes toward "allowing law enforcement to bring
in for questioning people of certain ethnic backgrounds if
these groups are thought to be more likely to engage in ter-
rorist activities."
This polarization coincided with a campaign to cast suspi-
cion on Muslims in the United States as potential terrorists
and on American liberals as enablers of terrorism. Funded by
conservative foundations and donors, this campaign encour-
aged media messaging and local mobilizations to block
mosque construction, introduce legislation against shari'a
law, and demand profiling of Muslims by law enforcement
agencies to counteract a supposed plot by Muslims to under-
mine the Constitution (Ali et al. 2011; Duss et al. 2015;
Yazdiha 2014). The campaign also cast liberals' defense of
Muslims' rights as a front for terrorism and a betrayal of
national security (Bawer 2009; D'Souza 2007; Glazov 2009;
Horowitz 2004).
Between 2001 and 2008, according to data analyses by
sociologist Christopher Bail (2015), fringe anti-Muslim
organizations managed to get their message increasingly into
mainstream media coverage of Muslims and developed
interlocking board memberships with mainstream conserva-
tive organizations. Some anti-Muslim activists, posing as
experts on Islamic extremism, were hired to train law
enforcement officers and military personnel (Sacirbey 2014);
according to an internal FBI review, 392 training presenta-
tions contained "offensive" stereotypes of Muslims and
Islam (Durbin 2012). The polarization of attitudes toward
Muslims was vividly displayed in responses to these pur-
ported experts. The Obama administration, which entered
office in 2009, tried to remove anti-Muslim activists from its
pool of trainers in countering violent extremism (CVE), the
phrase it adopted in place of counterterrorism (Cole 2012;
Department of Defense 2011). By contrast, the Republican
Party increasingly embraced anti-Muslim activists, who
were named as advisers to all of the leading presidential
campaigns in 2012 and 2016 (Kurzman 2016b; Bail 2015:98).
The campaigns of Mitt Romney and Donald Trump, for
example, both affiliated themselves with an anti-Muslim
activist who had expressed the paranoid concern that Muslim
extremists "are already in possession of weapons of mass
destruction inside the United States" and may have "infil-
trated the agencies that protect national security--the FBI,
DHS, Defense Department, military, and other institutions"
(Phares 2005:287­88).
Unfounded suspicion of American Muslims escalated to
the point that many non-Muslims were willing to consider
banning the practice of Islam in the United States. In a sur-
vey in October 2015, 67 percent of self-identified Democrats
said Islam should be legal, 15 percent said it should be ille-
gal, and 18 percent said they were not sure. Among self-
identified Independents, the responses were 60 percent
legal, 20 percent illegal, and 19 percent not sure.
Only two-thirds of these subsamples considered Muslims
deserving of freedom of religion, which is commonly hailed
as a bedrock principle of Constitutional protection and
international human rights (U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom 2016:9). Among self-
identified Republicans, this proportion was less than half:
Only 40 percent said Islam should be legal, while 36 per-
cent said it should be illegal, and 25 percent were not sure
(Public Policy Polling 2015).
Local Law Enforcement and Violent
Extremism
In the aftermath of 9/11, many state and local law enforce-
ment agencies--municipal police departments, sheriffs'
offices, state departments of public safety, and other agen-
cies--increased their emphasis on terrorism prevention. In a
survey of 219 state and local law enforcement leaders in
early 2004, 86 percent of respondents reported that 9/11 had
inspired operational and/or policy changes in their agency
(Needle 2005).
The federal government enlisted local law enforcement in
this mission. In 2003, the Bush administration began to
establish "fusion centers" around the United States to coordi-
nate activities by local law enforcement officials and federal
counterterrorism officials. Within a decade, more than 70
such centers were in operation (Monahan and Regan 2012;
Regan and Monahan 2013, 2014; U.S. Senate 2012). In
2009, the Obama administration inaugurated the Nationwide
Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative to train local law
enforcement in a federal system of information sharing on
"suspicious activity" related to violent extremism. In its first
three years, more than 200,000 officers received this training
(Napolitano 2012). In 2011, the Obama administration
announced a new strategy of community partnerships to pre-
vent violent extremism in the United States, relying largely
on local agencies because "The Federal Government will
often be ill-suited to intervene in the niches of society where
radicalization to violence takes place" (White House
2011a:3; see also White House 2011c).
Many local law enforcement agencies embraced the
counterterrorism mission, collaborating with researchers to
establish best practices for this work (International
Association of Chiefs of Police 2012a, 2012b; Miller,
Toliver, and Schanzer 2016; Schanzer et al. 2016). Some
agencies used this mandate to experiment with community
engagement (Schanzer et al. 2016; Weine et al. forthcom-
ing); others, most notably the New York Police Department
under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went in the direction of
community surveillance (Apuzzo and Goldman 2013). This
difference in approaches suggests that local law enforce-
ment agencies may hold varied ideas about the severity of
threats from violent extremism, although this has not been
studied directly. This article examines to what extent ideol-
ogy may be associated with this variation.
6 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World 
Methods
As part of a survey on local law enforcement agencies' com-
munity outreach programs, we asked agencies to rate the
level of threat from violent extremism in the United States in
the agency's jurisdiction:
On a scale from 1 to 5 (5 = Severe Threat, 1 = No Threat), please
rate how severe your agency believes the threat of violent
extremism is within your jurisdiction, for the following forms of
extremism (check one box in each column):
Al-Qaeda­Inspired Violent Other Violent Extremism
Extremism
1234512345
This survey was conducted in the first half of 2014, before the
self-proclaimed Islamic State began to encourage violence in
the United States.At the time of the survey, al-Qaeda was seen
as the dominant international terrorist network, and al-Qaeda­
inspired violent extremism was an umbrella term that avoided
the derogatory connotations that were sometimes associated
with the phrase Islamic terrorism. The sampling frame was all
480 state, county, and municipal law enforcement agencies
with more than 200 sworn officers, plus 63 additional county
and municipal agencies with 200 or fewer sworn officers in
selected jurisdictions that experienced an incident or prosecu-
tion for violent extremism in recent years. The survey yielded
responses from 339 of the larger agencies (a 71 percent
response rate) and 43 of the smaller agencies (a 68 percent
response rate), for a total of 382 law enforcement agencies (a
70 percent response rate), including 35 state agencies, 141
county agencies, and 206 municipal agencies, whose com-
bined jurisdictions covered 86 percent of the U.S. population.
The survey was mailed to the commanding officer of the
agency, with follow-up e-mails and telephone calls. The com-
manding officers themselves completed 49, or one-eighth, of
the surveys, generally in smaller agencies; the remainder were
completed by officers selected by the commanding officer,
generally individuals who directed or were involved in divi-
sions investigating violent extremism.
To identify the ideological context in which these threat
assessments were made, we merged the survey results with
city-, county-, and state-level estimates of ideology calculated
by political scientists Chris Tausanovitch and Christopher
Warshaw (2013, 2014). Replication data are available at
americanideologyproject.com (Warshaw and Tausanovitch
2015). This index, ranging from -1 (most liberal) to +1 (most
conservative), draws on dozens of policy questions in seven
large-scale surveys, aggregated through a multilevel regres-
sion and poststratification (MRP) model. This variable was
not available for 18 small jurisdictions in the law enforcement
survey, lowering the effective sample size from 382 to 364.
To measure the political attitudes of law enforcement
agencies, we draw on data developed by Crowdpac.com, a
technology company that has generated an index of political
attitudes of law enforcement officers living in each state and
county, based on publicly available data on campaign dona-
tions. The index, ranging from -10 (most liberal) to +10
(most conservative), is calculated through the campaigns and
organizations that the recipients of the officers' campaign
donations have themselves contributed to as well as the can-
didates' statements and (for incumbent candidates) their vot-
ing record (Bonica 2014). Using the same method, Crowdpac
has also created an index of the average political attitude of
the entire population within each city, county, and state. City-
level population attitudes are available at https://www.
crowdpac.com/games/lookup/hometown; county-level law
enforcement attitudes are available at https://www.crowd-
pac.com/games/lookup/police; state-level law enforcement
and population attitudes are available in Rohrlich (2015).
Crowdpac was kind enough to provide additional data on
county-level population attitudes for this project. These vari-
ables are imperfectly matched with one another: Law
enforcement attitudes are available only at the county and
state levels, while population attitudes are available at the
city, county, and state levels. We have merged county-level
law enforcement attitudes with city-level population atti-
tudes, because many city police officers live outside of city
boundaries (Silver 2014). From these variables, we gener-
ated a measure of the difference between law enforcement
officers' attitudes and population attitudes. Including this
variable lowers the effective sample size from 382 to 323.
To specify the number of incidents of violent extremism
occurring within each agency's jurisdiction prior to the sur-
vey in early 2014, we draw on the two most extensive data-
bases of Muslim American extremism and right-wing
extremism, respectively. The first is Kurzman (2017), which
lists the name, location, and demographic characteristics of
239 Muslim Americans involved with plots of violent
extremism from 9/11 through the end of 2013, just prior to
the law enforcement survey. The second data source is the
list of 4,420 right-wing violent extremist incidents between
1990 and 2011 that formed the basis for the analysis in
Perliger (2012); we thank Professor Perliger for sharing the
location variable of each incident. Both data sets were aggre-
gated to the level of city, county, and state and merged with
the survey results.
The two data sources on violent extremism adopt differ-
ent measurement approaches: The list of Muslim extremists
counts both incidents of violence and plots that were dis-
rupted before they could engage in violence, which comprise
a large majority of the cases, while Perliger (2012) counts
only incidents of violence. Perliger includes hate crimes and
ideologically motivated property damage, while the list of
Muslim extremists consists primarily of plots involving
indiscriminate violence against persons. Despite these differ-
ent approaches, the two data sets allow us to compare juris-
dictions with less or more violent extremism of each
sort--that is, jurisdictions with less Muslim extremism as
against those with more Muslim extremism and jurisdictions
with less right-wing extremism as against those with more
right-wing extremism.
Kurzman et al. 7
Both measures of extremism involve count data that are
highly skewed and include many zero values: 73 percent of
the jurisdictions whose agencies participated in the survey
had experienced no cases of Muslim extremism since 9/11,
and 46 percent of the jurisdictions had experienced no cases
of right-wing violence. The inverse hyperbolic sine transfor-
mation is designed to handle data of this form (Burbidge,
Magee, and Robb 1988), although it is typically used for
dependent variables; an alternative approach, adding a posi-
tive number to the zero value cases and taking the natural
log, generated similar findings. (The pattern of significant
and nonsignificant coefficients is the same for logged values
using additions of .01, .1, and 1.)
We also control for the population (logged) in each agen-
cy's jurisdiction, drawn from the 2010 U.S. census (Social
Explorer 2015), because larger populations may offer a greater
pool for recruitment by extremists. Models involving Muslim
extremism also include the estimated number of Muslims as a
percentage of total population in 2010 in each jurisdiction
(Grammich et al. 2012). For the 83 jurisdictions whose Muslim
population is not available in this data source, we set the figure
arbitrarily to .016 percent, which is the smallest value of the
non-missing data as well as the value of the 10th percentile.
Ideology and Threat Assessment
State and local law enforcement agencies were less likely to
identify Muslim extremism as a severe threat within their
jurisdictions than other forms of violent extremism (see
Figure 2). Within the "other" category, the primary ideology
identified by these agencies was "anti-government" extrem-
ism, which was listed as one of the top three threats of violent
extremism in 73.8 percent of the jurisdictions; this rate was
almost double the next most widely identified threat, Muslim
extremism, which was listed as one of the top three in 39.3
percent of the jurisdictions (Table 1).
This finding replicates threat assessments in two earlier
surveys of law enforcement agencies. In 2002, 85 percent
of state agencies and 17 percent of local agencies reported
that right-wing terrorist groups were located in their juris-
diction; 38 percent and 3 percent, respectively, reported
knowledge of "religious groups using violence" in their
jurisdiction (Riley et al. 2005:9). In 2013­2014, a survey of
259 law enforcement officers ranked sovereign citizens as
the greatest potential threat (mean response of 3.20 on a
scale of 1 [strongly disagree] to 4 [strongly agree]; Islamic
extremists/jihadists were ranked second with a mean
response of 2.89 (Carter et al. 2014:7). One smaller survey
of 37 state police agencies in 2006­2007 found the reverse,
with Islamic extremists/jihadists rated as a greater threat to
state security than right-wing groups (Freilich, Chermak,
and Simone 2009:462).
Switching to multivariate regression with threat assess-
ment as the dependent variable (Table 2), we find that threat
assessment of al-Qaeda­inspired violent extremism is cor-
related with the number of Muslim violent extremists in a
Figure 2. Threat assessment of violent extremism by state and local law enforcement agencies, 2014.
Note: Gray = al-Qaeda­inspired violent extremism; black = other violent extremism.

jurisdiction (Model 1) and that threat assessment of other
forms of violent extremism is correlated with the number of
incidents of right-wing violent extremism (Model 4). Logged
population size is also correlated with threat assessment, as
expected, and the number of Muslims as a percent of the total
population of the jurisdiction is correlated with threat assess-
ment of al-Qaeda­inspired violent extremism.
Introducing ideology, however, has different effects on
threat assessment. For al-Qaeda­inspired violent extremism
(Model 2), political attitudes of the jurisdiction are a strong
predictor of threat assessment, even stronger than the num-
ber of Muslim violent extremists, whose coefficient falls to
marginal statistical significance (p = .07). For other forms of
violent extremism (Model 5), political attitudes do not affect
threat assessment, which remains strongly correlated with
the number of right-wing violent incidents in the jurisdiction.
(Another study has found evidence that conservative atti-
tudes in a county are associated with the presence of far-right
ideological violence [Adamczyk et al. 2012], although we
are unable to replicate this finding with our data.)
The law enforcement agencies in our survey reported
lower levels of threat in conservative jurisdictions than in
liberal jurisdictions. A shift of one point in the political ideol-
ogy scale (e.g., from the most liberal to the midpoint of the
scale) is associated with a lower threat assessment of two-
thirds of a point, on average, on a five-point scale.
This pattern holds in subsets of the sample as well, such
as liberal jurisdictions only (political attitudes scale <0), con-
servative jurisdictions only (political attitudes scale >0), and
middle-of-the-road jurisdictions only (political attitudes
scale between -0.5 and +0.5): More conservative jurisdic-
tions, even within these subsamples, are associated with
lower threat assessments for Muslim extremism, controlling
for the actual number of Muslim extremists, and are not sig-
nificantly correlated with threat assessments for other
extremisms, controlling for the actual number of right-wing
incidents.
The pattern also holds with the percentage of votes cast
for Obama in 2012 and with an indicator of the party in
office. Agencies reporting to a Republican mayor, sheriff, or
governor (or county board or executive for county agencies
with appointed sheriffs) were marginally more likely (p =
.06) to rate threats from Muslim extremism lower than agen-
cies led by Democrats and Independents, controlling for the
actual number of Muslim extremists. Party affiliation did not
matter for the assessment of other forms of violent extrem-
ism. (A dummy variable for elected sheriffs was not signifi-
cant for either form of threat.)
The pattern holds as well with a direct indicator of law
enforcement officers' political attitudes, as calculated by
Crowdpac from campaign donation data, although this indi-
cator is not available for all of the jurisdictions surveyed for
this project. As shown in Table 2, threat assessment of
Muslim extremism was associated with the difference
between the political attitudes of law enforcement officers
and the jurisdiction at large: Agencies where officers were
more conservative than the population they served rated the
threat of Muslim extremism higher than agencies where offi-
cers were more liberal than the population (Model 3). The
difference between law enforcement attitudes and the popu-
lation's attitudes was not significantly associated with the
assessment of other forms of violent extremism (Model 6).
Threat Assessment and Subsequent
Violent Extremism
Law enforcement agencies' threat assessments may have
been based in part on ongoing investigations of plots that had
not yet yielded arrests or otherwise come to public attention.
These cases would not have appeared in the data sets of vio-
lent extremism.
To test whether this was the case, we counted Muslim
Americans associated with violent extremism in 2015, the
year following the survey (Kurzman 2016a). Cases were
more numerous in 2015 than in any year since 9/11, spurred
by online recruitment by the self-proclaimed "Islamic State,"
although the pace of new cases dropped off sharply in the
middle of the year (Kurzman 2016a, 2017). Most of these
cases involved arrests of individuals attempting to join mili-
tant groups overseas. No comprehensive list of right-wing
violent extremism was available for 2015, comparable to the
Perliger (2012) data set for earlier years.
The number of Muslim American extremists in 2015 in
each jurisdiction was strongly correlated with the number of
cases in previous years as well as with logged population
(Table 3, Model 1). The size of the Muslim population, net of
total population, was not correlated with the number of cases
in 2015--it was not correlated with the number of cases in
previous years either, although it was positively associated

with law enforcement's threat assessment for al-Qaeda­
inspired violent extremism. Law enforcement agencies'2014
threat assessment, added in Model 2, is not significantly cor-
related with the number of cases in 2015. A likelihood-ratio
(LR) test indicates that adding this variable does not improve
model fit (LR chi-square = .95, p = .33).
Whatever nonpublic information about al-Qaeda­inspired
violent extremism that law enforcement agencies had in
2014, therefore, did not help them to predict cases of Muslim
extremism in 2015.
Conclusion
Four observations emerge from these findings. First, we note
that ideology mattered in the assessment of threats from
Muslim extremism. Law enforcement agencies in liberal

10 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World 
jurisdictions rated the threat of Muslim extremism higher than
agencies in more conservative areas. Agencies that were more
conservative than the public they served rated threats from
Muslim extremism more highly than agencies in which offi-
cers were no more conservative than the jurisdiction at large.
We do not have evidence in these data sets to explain why this
might be so, but we do have evidence that this assessment was
correlated more strongly with ideological factors than with the
number of Muslim extremists in the jurisdiction.
Second, ideology did not matter in assessment of threats from
other forms of violent extremism. These assessments were not
the inverse of the threat from Muslim extremism: They were not
higher in conservative areas than liberal areas. Instead, threat
assessments hewed consistently to the number of incidents of
right-wing violence in the jurisdiction. This is particularly nota-
ble because of the definitional mismatch between the indicator of
violence (right-wing violence only) and the threat assessment
category of "other violent extremism," which is not limited to
right-wing extremism (although that was the most common form
of extremism identified by the law enforcement agencies).
Despite the statistical noise that we would expect from this mis-
match, threat assessment in this "other" category was robustly
correlated with the prevalence of right-wing violence.
Third, the contrast between the two forms of extremism
offers a telling comparison of the effect of ideology on
threat assessment. Ideology does not matter equally for all
forms of threat assessment. In the context of increasing
polarization of attitudes toward Muslims in America, ideo-
logical factors are associated with the perception of threat
posed by Muslim extremists but not with perception of
threat posed by other extremists. This ideological context
outweighs the effect of evidence of extremism by Muslims,
but it does not outweigh evidence of right-wing extremism.
We do not offer a theory of threat assessment, but we note
that these findings support the suggestion from the field of
critical terrorism studies that American responses to
Muslim extremism are related more to ideological consid-
erations than to the observable scale of the threat.
Finally, law enforcement's threat assessment of al-Qaeda­
inspired violent extremism did not predict the number of
Muslims involved in violent extremism the following year,
controlling for the number of cases in previous years. This
finding reinforces the impression that threat assessment
regarding Muslim extremists may be detached from the actual
level of threat, a "moral panic" in sociological terms. "The
United States is obsessed with terrorism, to an unhealthy and
illogical degree," a recent analysis concluded. "When politi-
cians attempt to calm those fears, to put terrorism into per-
spective, they are accused of ignoring danger, of coddling the
enemy. Terrorists want attention; our hyper-sensitivity to their
violence feeds that need." This judgment came not from the
field of critical terrorism studies but from the former director
of analysis at the National Counterterrorism Center and dep-
uty director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center (Liepman
and Mudd 2016:14).
