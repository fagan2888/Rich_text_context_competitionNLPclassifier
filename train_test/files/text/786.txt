Abstract. Objective: `Ib examine the population
and geographic patterns, patient characteristics, and
clinical presentations and outcomes of alcohol-related
ED visits at a national level. Methods: Cross-sec-
tional data on a probability sample of 21,886ED vis-
its from the 1995 National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey were analyzed with considera-
tion of the individual patient visit weight. The annual
number and rates of alcohol-related ED visits were
computed based on weighted analysis in relation to
demographic characteristics and geographic region.
Specific variables of alcohol-related ED visits exam-
ined included demographic and medical characteris-
tics, patient-reported reasons for visit, and physi-
cians' principal diagnoses. Results: Of the 96.5
million ED visits in 1995,an estimated 2.6 million
(2.7%)were related to alcohol abuse. The overall an-
nual rate of alcohol-related ED visits was 10.0visits
per 1,000 population [95% confidence interval (CI)
8.7-11.31.Higher rates were found for men (14.7per
1,000,
95% CI 12.5-16.9),
adults aged 25 to 44years

95% CI 14.0-22.11,
and residents living in the
northeast region (15.2per 1,000,
95% CI 12.1-18.2).
Patients whose visits were alcohol-related were more
likely than other patients to be uninsured, smokers,
or depressive. Alcohol-related ED visits were 1
.
6
times as likely as other visits to be injury-related,and
1.8times as likely to be rated as "urgent" or "emer-
gent." The leading principal reasons for alcohol-re-
lated ED visits were complaints of pain, injury, and
drinking problems. Alcohol abusddependence was
the principal diagnosis for 20% of the alcohol-related
visits. Conclusion:Alcohol abuse poses a major bur-
den on the emergency medical care system. The age,
gender, and geographic characteristics of alcohol-re-
lated ED visits are consistent with drinking patterns
in the general population. Key words: alcohol abuse;

UBSTANCE abuse is a major public health
Sissue faced by emergency physicians (EPs).
According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network
(DAWN),more than half a million ED visits were
caused by drug abuse in 1994.' The DAWN, cur-
rently sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Men-
tal Health Services Administration, was designed
to monitor nonalcohol substance abuse based on a
nationally representative probability sample of
hospital EDs. National estimates of alcohol-related
ED visits were not available until recent years.

Most previous studies of alcohol and ED visits
were limited to individual hospitals, with an em-
phasis on the relationship between alcohol and in-
jury.* In an ED-based study involving 4 community
hospitals, Cherpitels found that 11% of injured pa-
tients and 5% of diseased patients were positive for
alcohol. Involvement of alcohol in adolescent
trauma has been reported to range from 36% to
48%.4-sUsing a case-crossover design, Vinson et
al.7examined the transient effect of alcohol on the
risk of injury necessitating an ED visit and found
that alcohol use is associated with a 1.5-fold in-
creased risk of injury.
Although a variety of diseases are directly at-
tributable to alcohol, few studies have examined
the role of alcohol in emergency medical conditions
other than injury. Little is known about the distri-
bution of alcohol-related ED visits in different pop-
ulations and geographic regions. This study was
undertaken to document the descriptive epidemi-
ology of alcohol-related ED visits at a national
level and to explore the utility of the National Hos-
pital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS)
as a resource for emergency care research.

METHODS
Study Design. This study was an analysis of
data on ED visits from the 1995NHAMCS. Started
in 1992 and sponsored by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS), the NHAMCS collects
data each year for a national probability sample of
ED visits and outpatient department visits, to pro-
vide health services information about ambulatory
medical care in the United States.8 Since data for
this study were from the database issued by the
NCHS for public use with all patient identifiers
removed, this research was exempted from review
by the institutional review board at the Johns Hop-
kins University School of Medicine.
Study Setting. The NHAMCS has 2 components,
ED visits and outpatient department visits. This
study was limited to the data for ED visits. The
ED visits database of the 1995 NHAMCS was a
nationally representative sample of all visits to
EDs of nonfederal and noninstitutional hospitals,
exclusive of hospitals with an average length of
stay for all patients of 230 days. Using a multi-
stage probability sampling strategy, the 1995
NHAMCS selected a sample of 21,886 ED visits
from 112 primary sampling units and 437 hospi-
tals, with a hospital response rate of 94%.8 The
US. Bureau of the Census regional office staff co-
ordinated the data collection, including training
the field representatives and overseeing the imple-
mentation of the protocol. Field representatives
were responsible for inducting hospitals and train-
ing the hospital staff on the visit sampling method
and completion of the data forms. The actual data
collection was done by the trained hospital staff
using the uniform patient record forms during a
randomly assigned 4-week period for each of the
selected hospitals. The patient record form was
filled out at or near the time of visit for each sam-
pled patient. The hospital staff responsible for data
collection were instructed in how to complete each
data item by the field representatives and were
provided with instruction booklets.
The target number of patient record forms to be
completed was 50 ED visits at each of the selected
hospitals. Visits were selected based on a system-
atic sampling method; i.e., picking up every r-th
visit after a random start, with r determined by
dividing the expected number of visits during the
reporting period by 50. The sampling design and
data collection procedures are described in detail
elsewhere.8
Measurements. The patient record form contains
a data item indicating whether the visit was alco-
hol- or drug-related. A visit was defined as being
alcohol-related if the patient's most important
complaint or presenting problem was caused by
use or abuse of alcohol. By this definition, alcohol-
related visits also include trauma patients who
were injured by alcohol intoxicated drivers. Alco-
hol-relatedness was determined by the hospital
staff based on information in the medical records,
such as patient complaints, physician diagnoses,
and laboratory testing results. Alcohol-relatedness
was coded as "unknown" for 4,556 (21%) of the
21,886 ED visits in the 1995 NHAMCS. A compar-
ative analysis indicated that those visits with un-
known alcohol-relatedness were more similar in
patient age, gender, and race to the visits that
were not alcohol-related than the visits that were
alcohol-related. In the data analysis, visits with
unknown alcohol-relatedness. were combined with
visits that were not alcohol-related. Categorizing
the 4,556 visits with unknown alcohol-relatedness
into the group of visits that were not alcohol-re-
lated undoubtedly biased the results toward un-
derestimating the magnitude of alcohol-related ED
visits. In this study, the measurements of interest
were the estimated annual frequency of alcohol-re-
lated ED visits, the rates of alcohol-related ED vis-
its per 1,000 population, and the proportions of ED
visits that were alcohol-related.
Data Analysis. The probability sampling design
of the NHAMCS made it possible to generate na-
tional estimates of the major epidemiologic char-
acteristics of ED visits. Based on the probabilities
of selection and adjustment for nonresponse, a Ups-
tient visit weight" was assigned by NCHS to each
of the 21,886 ED visits included in the 1995
NHAMCS sample. Using these weights in the data
analysis provides national estimates. Standard er-
rors for these national estimates were computed
using the method recommended by NCHS.8 To
avoid the complexity resulting from the multistage
probability sampling design, significance testing
was not conducted. Instead, 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIS) were calculated using the standard er-
rors. Population data used to compute annual
rates of alcohol-related ED visits were based on the
provisional estimates for the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population as of July 1, 1995, provided
by the U S . Bureau of the Census.
Patient characteristics examined in this study
included age, sex, race, insurance status, and ge-
ographic region. Information on smoking, depres-
sion, time of the visit, urgency of the visit, reason
for the visit, and principal diagnosis also was an-
alyzed. Urgency was coded as either "urgentlemer-
gent," if the medical condition necessitated imme-
diate attention and delay of care would be harmful
to the patient; or "non-urgent," if the medical con-
dition did not necessitate attention immediately or
within a few hours. Data analysis progressed from

RESULTS
its. Of the alcohol-related ED visits, 14.6% also in-
volved illicit drugs, such as cocaine and heroin.
Rates. The overall annual rate of alcohol-related
ED visits was estimated as 10.0 visits per 1,000
population. The rates peaked at age 25 to 44years
and were lowest among children and elders. Males
had significantly higher rates than females in all
age groups except children under 15years, where
the rates were similar between sexes (Table 1).
Overall, the annual rate of alcohol-related ED vis-
its for males (14.7visits per 1,000population) was
2.6times the rate for females (5.6visits per 1,000
population).
Alcohol-related ED visits also varied with race.
In 1995,blacks made 18.1alcohol-related ED visits
per 1,000population, compared with 8.8 visits per
1,000 population for whites. The discrepancy be-
tween blacks and whites existed primarily among
adults aged 25 to 64years (Table 1).The rates for
the young and the elder populations showed little
racial differences. The racial pattern for males was
consistent with that for females, with blacks hav-
ing the highest rates of alcohol-related ED visits
and whites the lowest for both sexes, and with
other minorities at the intermediate level (Fig. 1).
When the data were examined by geographic
regions, it was apparent that people living in the
south had the lowest rate of alcohol-related ED vis-
its (7.4per 1,000population), whereas residents in
the northeast had the highest rate (15.2per 1,000
population) (Table 1).
Patient Characteristics. In the following anal-
yses, alcohol-related ED visits were considered in
terms of their proportions among all ED visits.

Visits by adults in the middle-age range (25-44
years) were significantly more likely to be alcohol-
related than visits by patients in other age groups
(Table 2). The age pattern for male patients was
more pronounced than for females (Fig. 2). Males
aged 25 to 44 years accounted for 15%of all ED
visits and 40% of all alcohol-related ED visits.
Overall, ED visits made by male patients were 2.7
times as likely to be alcohol-related as visits made
by females (Table 2).
Ethnic background and insurance status also
were associated with alcohol-related ED visits (Ta-
ble 2). Of the ED visits made by blacks and other

minorities, 3.3% were alcohol-related, compared
with 2.5% of the visits made by whites. Overall, 1
of 6 ED visits was made by uninsured patients.
Visits by patients who were uninsured were sig-
nificantly more likely than other visits to be alco-
hol-related (Table 2). This association between in-
surance status and alcohol-related visits was also
found in different subgroups of patients aged 215
years when stratified by age, gender, and race.
The prevalence rates of smoking and depression
among ED patients were 7% and 3%,respectively.
ED visits by patients who smoked were >12 times
as likely to be alcohol-related as visits by non-
smokers (Table 2). The proportion of alcohol-re-
lated ED visits for patients with depression was
nearly 6 times that for patients without depression
(Table 2). Whereas depression was more common
among smokers than nonsmokers (9% vs l%),
there appeared an interaction effect of depression
and smoking on alcohol-related ED visits: the pro-
portion of alcohol-related visits increased from
~ 1 %
for nonsmokers without depression, to 5% for
nonsmoking patients with depression, to 9% for
smokers without depression, and to 23% for smok-
ers with depression.
Injury accounted for 39% of all ED visits and
50% of all alcohol-related ED visits (Table 2).
Among injury-related visits, those resulting from
assaults or homicide were most likely to involve
alcohol (19%), followed by self-inflicted injuries
(lo%), poisoning (7%), and motor vehicle crashes
(5%)
Alcohol-related ED visits accounted for a higher
proportion of visits that were coded as urgent/
emergent as compared with nonurgent visits (Ta-
ble 2). Visits in the northeast region also were
more likely to be alcohol-related than in other

icantly higher than the rate, 12.6% (95% CI,
12.0-13.1), for other ED visits. Admissions to in-
tensive care units accounted for 13%of all hospital
admissions among alcohol-related visits and 15%
among other visits. The annual number of patients
who died on arrival or at the ED was estimated to
be 301,000 persons, or 0.3%of all ED visits. The
case-fatality rates did not differ significantly be-
tween alcohol-related visits and other visits.

DISCUSSION
The health consequences of alcohol abuse have
been documented primarily based on mortality
data and hospital discharge data. It is estimated
that alcohol contributes to about 100,000 deaths
and 1 million hospitalizations each year in the
United State~.~-*O
This study sheds light on the
magnitude of alcohol-related morbidity and the ED
resources deployed for alcohol-related visits. Our
results reveal that 2.6 million ED visits in 1995

regions. There was an apparent temporal pattern
in alcohol-related visits: whereas about 2% of day-
time ED visits were alcohol-related, the proportion
in which alcohol was attributed as a factor rose
after 8 PM and peaked at about 7%for visits oc-
curring between 2
:
O
O AM and 359 AM (Fig. 3).
TABLE3. Percentages and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIS)of
the 20 Principal Reasons Most Frequently Mentioned by
Patients for Alcohol-relatedED Visits, United States, 1995
Principal Reason for Visit. A total of 162 prin-
cipal reasons were recorded for alcohol-related ED
visits. More than half (52%)of the patients re-
ported one of the 20 reasons listed in Table 3. The
principal reason most frequently reported by pa-
tients was chest pain, accounting for 5%of all al-
cohol-related ED visits (Table 3). Other pain-re-
lated complaints frequently reported by patients
included back pain, headache, abdominal pain, and
neck pain. Reasons not related to pain could be
generally categorized into 2 groups, injury and al-
cohol abuse.
For ED visits that were not alcohol-related, fe-
ver was the leading principal reason, reported by
4.9%of the patients, followed by chest pain (4.7%)
and abdominal pain (3.9%).

Principal Diagnosis. Alcohol abuse, alcohol de-
pendence, and other alcohol-related mental disor-
ders were the principal diagnoses for more than a
fourth (26%)of alcohol-related ED visits. The 20
most frequently recorded principal diagnoses are
listed in Table 4, accounting for 60%of all alcohol-
related visits. In addition to alcohol abuse and al-
cohol dependence, injury, particularly open wound,
was the common principal diagnosis.
In contrast to the profile of principal diagnoses
for alcohol-related ED visits, the leading diagnoses
for other ED visits were otitis media (3.1%),ab-
dominal pain (2.5%),acute upper respiratory in-
fection (2.2%),chest pain (2.1%),acute pharyngitis
(1.9%),
and asthma (1.9%).

resulted from abuse of alcohol, yielding a rate of
10 alcohol-related ED visits per 1,000 population.
Previous research showed that quantity and fre-
quency of alcohol use are predictive of adverse so-
cial consequences (e.g., losing a job and being ar-
rested for driving under the influence of alcohol).11
Results from the present study indicate that the
rates of alcohol-related ED visits were significantly
higher in men, adults 25 to 44 years of age, and
residents of the northeast region. The gender, age,

For instance, it
has long been recognized that the northeast is the
"wettest" region and the south the "driest"as mea-
sured in the prevalence of drinking,I2 which cor-
respond respectively with the highest and the low-
est rates of alcohol-related ED visits.
Although drinking among whites is slightly
more prevalent than among blacks,12J3this study
indicates that the rate of alcohol-related ED visits
for blacks is nearly twice that for whites. This ra-
cial discrepancy in alcohol-related ED visits is
probably due to socioeconomic factors. It is known
that much higher proportions of blacks and other
minorities than whites are ~ n i n s u r e d ~ ~ . ' ~
and that
the uninsured are more likely to use the ED as
their regular source of are.'^,'^ In this study, we
found that 19% of the black patients and 16% of
the white patients were uninsured, and for both
races ED visits by the uninsured were more than
twice as likely as visits by the insured to be alco-
hol-related. Thus, additional yet-to-be-explored
factors, such as the higher incidence rates of fire-
arm-related injuries among blacks,i8must contrib-
ute to the observed racial disparity in rates of al-
cohol-related ED visits.
This study adds more evidence that alcohol is
an important risk factor for injuries treated at the
ED. Injury-related ED visits were significantly
more likely to involve alcohol than other ED visits.
One-half of all alcohol-related ED visits were due
to injuries. Although the strength of the associa-
tion between alcohol and injury among ED pa-
tients is not as strong as found in patients admit-
ted to trauma centers or in injury fatalities,lgthe
magnitude of alcohol-related injury necessitating
emergency care is worrisome. Results from this
study indicate that approximately 1.3 million ED
visits each year are attributable to alcohol-related
injury. The finding that alcohol-related ED visits
are more likely to be urgenuemergent, as com-
pared with visits that are not alcohol-related, fur-
ther reflects the important role that alcohol plays
in injury.

sion and smoking are the variables most predictive
of alcohol-related ED visits. Depression is preva-
lent among elder ED patients but is rarely recog-
nized by E P S . ~ ~
Since alcohol, tobacco, and depres-
sion are closely correlated, it will be beneficial to
apply a holistic approach to addressing these
health issues in the ED patient population. The
routine practice of screening all ED patients for
risk factors such as alcohol abuse and cigarette
smoking, in conjunction with a streamlined mech-
anism for referral into rehabilitation and counsel-
ing programs, could lead to emergency services'
having a profound impact on the nation's public
health. Improving and ensuring access to high-
quality emergency care is one of the priority areas
recommended by the Macy Foundation Conference
on the Future of Emergency Medicine.25The Public
Health and Education Task Force of the SAEM is
charged with making access to emergency care, in-
cluding screening for substance abuse and violent
behaviors and providing counseling, referral, pa-
tient education, and community-based health pro-
motion, an objective of the national health agenda
for the years 2001 to 2010.26
794 ALCOHOL Li et al. ALCOHOLRELATEDED VISITS
LIMITATIONS
AND FUTURE
QUESTIONS
Despite the importance of emergency medical care
in the national health system, ED-based surveil-
lance has been largely lacking. A few existing ED-
based information systems are restricted to moni-
toring narrowly defined emergency episodes. While
the DAWN is limited to nonalcohol drug abuse, the
US. Consumer Product Safety Commission's Na-
tional Electronic Injury Surveillance System
(NEISS) reports only certain product-related inju-
ries treated in a probability sample of 91 hospital
ED's.18 Injuries related to major products such as
alcoholic beverages and motor vehicles are not in-
cluded in the NEISS.
The NHAMCS represents the most comprehen-
sive ED-based information system. This study
shows that the NHAMCS is a valuable data source
for studying the epidemiology of emergency medi-
cal conditions at the national level. Data on alco-
hol-related ED visits from the NHAMCS appeared
to be valid because the age, gender, and geographic
patterns described in this study are consonant
with drinking patterns in the general population.
Since we combined those visits in which the role
of alcohol was unknown with visits known not to
be alcohol-related, the estimated frequency and
rates of alcohol-related ED visits reported here are
conservative. Inherent limitations of the data in-
clude the fact that alcohol-relatedness of ED visits
was not determined by universal alcohol testing,
but rather by evaluation of the clinical presenta-
tion as reflected in the patient's chart. Further-
more, because patients were not routinely
screened for problem drinking using established
interview instruments, the results of this study are
primarily estimates of acute alcohol effects. There-
fore, the data should not be interpreted as the
prevalence of alcoholism in the ED patient popu-
lation. A study involving 2 hospitals and using
standard screening instruments indicated that the
prevalence rates of alcohol dependence among ED
patients aged 218 years range from 9% to 19%,
depending on the geographic region and patient
characteristic^.^'
Future research should address the economic
costs of alcohol-related ED visits, further examine
the role of alcohol in other major emergency med-
ical conditions such as chest pain and abdominal
pain, and implement and evaluate ED-based inter-
vention programs.
CONCLUSIONS
Alcohol abuse poses a major burden on the nation's
emergency care system. Each year, nearly 3 mil-
lion ED visits are caused by abuse of alcohol. In-
jury accounts for 50%of all alcohol-related ED vis-
its. The age, gender, and geographic characteristics
of alcohol-related ED visits are consistent with
drinking patterns in the general population. Men,
young and mid-aged adults, and blacks are at in-
creased risk of making alcohol-related ED visits.
ED visits by uninsured patients are more than
twice as likely to be alcohol-related as visits by the
insured. Alcohol among injury-related visits is sig-
nificantly more prevalent than among visits for
other medical conditions. Alcohol-related ED visits
are closely correlated with smoking and depres-
sion. The causal relationship between alcohol and
injury is well established based on controlled epi-
demiologic studies. There is a need to systemati-
cally examine the role of alcohol in other major
emergency medical conditions, such as chest pain
and abdominal pain. High priority should be
placed on integrating alcohol screening and inter-
vention programs into emergency care.
