Abstract
This paper draws together empirical findings from our study of hackathons in the UK with literature on big data through
three interconnected frameworks: data as discourse, data as datalogical and data as materiality. We suggest not only that
hackathons resonate the wider socio-technical and political constructions of (big) data that are currently enacted in
policy, education and the corporate sector (to name a few), but also that an investigation of hackathons reveals the
extent to which `data' operates as a powerful discursive tool; how the discourses (and politics) of data mask and reveal a
series of tropes pertaining to data; that the politics of data are routinely and simultaneously obscured and claimed with
serious implications for expertise and knowledge; and that ultimately, and for the vast majority of hackathons we have
attended, the discursive and material constructions of data serve to underpin rather than challenge existing power
relations and politics.

Introduction
This paper draws together empirical findings from our
study of hackathons1 in the UK with literature on big
data through three interconnected frameworks: data as
discourse, data as datalogical and data as materiality.
We suggest not only that hackathons resonate the wider
socio-technical and political constructions of (big) data
that are currently enacted in policy, education and the
corporate sector (to name a few), but also that an inves-
tigation of hackathons reveals the extent to which
`data' operates as a powerful discursive tool; how the
discourses (and politics) of data mask and reveal a
series of tropes pertaining to data; that the politics of
data are routinely and simultaneously obscured and
claimed with serious implications for expertise and
knowledge; and that ultimately, and for the vast major-
ity of hackathons we have attended, the discursive and
material constructions of data serve to underpin rather
than challenge existing power relations and politics.
At the same time, (big) data is already, as David
Beer has noted: `an established presence in our every-
day cultural lives' (2015: 2) and this means that the
material and embodied configurations of data are
already normative and quotidian. It also suggests that
hackathons can be investigated as a `datalogical struc-
ture' (Clough et al., n.d., 2015) in terms of the events
themselves and as particular prototypes pertaining to
how innovation and creativity occurs ­ as increasingly
data driven and automated. In relation to hackathon
events, these normative and quotidian configurations
also highlight a real disjuncture between the way data
is discursively constructed, and the way data is vari-
ously and unevenly operationalized in the material
and embodied processes of the events themselves.
Inhabiting the hack
Hackathons are established methods and `spaces of
innovation' in the corporate sector (see Go

public and third sectors across the globe (see also Irani,
2015; Leckart, 2012; Marlow, 2013; Townsend, 2013
for histories of the hackathons). They have been
widely discussed and critiqued within academia and
industry2 and our aim for this paper is to draw on
our experiences in order to critically discuss what we
perceive as the underlying and connective thread across
all the hackathons events we researched: the discursive,
technological and material significance of data.
For our research, the hackathons we attended were
delineated along three axes: (1) Those within the arts
and creative sectors, where programmers, coders, hack-
ers, digital artists used hack and `wreck' methods to
explore digital objects as new ways of `creative' and
political disruption (Octopus, FoAM, Access Space,
Digital Labs, MzTek, ODI and MadLab). (2) Those
within the public sector, where the model of the hacka-
thon and creative lab has been adopted as means of fast
innovation and public engagement (see also Gregg,
2015). An extension of this also includes key user
groups (families, young people, disabled groups) who
work with coders, programmers and designers to `solve'
a social, health or cultural issue (`Leeds Hack', `Hack
the City', `Young Peoples Digital Innovation Lab',
`Watch-It', `Leeds NHS Hack', `Leeds Data Mill
hacks'). (3) Those within the corporate sectors where
individuals or groups are invited to develop prototypes
or ideas into marketable commodities, usually competi-
tively, through a range of established hackathons meth-
ods (Up London, Digital Shoreditch and USTWO ­ a
digital products studio). While these events varied enor-
mously in terms of politics and aims, what was notable
for us was not only the reach of the hackathons across
many sectors but also the continual feeling of de
´ ja
` vu
we experienced regardless of the event.
We attended just over 20 hackathons in the UK
between 2013 and 2016 as participant observers, but
we also worked with hackathons organizers and digital
artists as they organized and ran hackathons events in
order to understand processes behind the events and
their position within a wider spectrum of temporality
(beyond the discrete event itself). The particular meth-
odological approach we used in our fieldwork was
drawn from Pink et al.'s (2015) concept of `digital eth-
nography', which is situated in the politics and prin-
ciples of reflexivity, participation and observation but
is also attuned to the (digital) mediatory elements of
digital culture (2015: 3). Our aim was to understand
the event from the perspectives of those involved, and
reflexively consider our own involvement, with a central
question around the issue of innovation: who claimed it,
when and how. Our methodological leanings were
towards ethnography and we drew on a wide corpus
of research not only in feminist new media theory, eth-
nography and digital anthropology but also in design,
digital humanities, organizational studies, business
management and science and technology studies to
anchor our approach (see e.g., Hoholm and Araujo,
2011; Irani, 2015; Suchman et al., 2002). We were
also aware of the unique temporal and spatial environ-
ment of hackathons and so were also informed by the
notion of `fast' digital ethnography following the work
of Hoholm and Araujo (2011), which focuses on `an
emerging object or practice from the inception of an
idea to its successful realization (or indeed failure)'
(2011: 936). However, we soon came to realize that
the object and practice of our research was not innov-
ation, in fact, but data, and this posed different meth-
odological and critical questions for us. It led us on two
paths: the first was a discussion of the ethnographic
material and considerations of methods and practice
(written about elsewhere).3 The second path ­ encapsu-
lated in this article ­ was a critical interrogation of the
significance of data within and beyond these events.
Although we reference ethnographic material, then,
this paper is a reflective and critical interrogation and
not a presentation of the ethnographic material per se.
In what follows, we discuss three interwoven strands
that emerged from our research: data as discourse, data
as datalogical and data as materiality. These three con-
figurations enable us to elucidate the multiple and oscil-
latory alignments of data. For example, on the one
hand hackathons are only possible because of digital
technologies and their underpinning datasets, and this
is written into the discursive signifiers of the events
themselves.4 This means that data is both a discursive
trope with particular affordances and a material `con-
dition' of the events (Suchman, 2007). At the same time
and as we discuss in this paper, data is simultaneously
obscured through the infrastructure of the hackathon
events where the emphasis is on creativity and innov-
ation. For us, this reconfigures certain power relations
and undermines (we argue) the possibility for a deeper
interrogation of the politics of data as an operational or
conditional force. Given this, hackathons are not just
emergent and proliferating events and methods across a
range of sectors: they are also a useful lens to interro-
gate contemporary issues around (big) data not least
because they return us to issues around discursive and
material automation (see also Bassett, 2016; Clough
et al., 2015; Sterne, 2015), metrification and value, the
politics of data and a critical inquiry into `datalogical'
turn (see Clough et al., 2015).
Data as discourse
As suggested above, `data' is a discursive trope with
particular affordances for the events themselves and
written into the language of the events through an
explicit reference to the digital and to particular
2 Big Data & Society
cultural moments and politics of digital culture.5 The
second issue is that these constructions of data also
obscure a very real discriminatory politics in which
non-valuable data (`raw', `dirty', `waste' data) is not
simply negated, it is actively unsought, dismissed, dis-
appeared. This means there is a politics at the heart of
these events that remains unacknowledgeable through
the discourse of data. At the same time, because data is
constructed as a malleable, benign tool for participants,
identifying the discriminatory politics that are mobi-
lized is a difficult task and one that resonates the exist-
ing debates within big data about obscured data
aggregation, value and waste (see boyd and
Crawford, 2012; Clough et al., 2015; Kitchin, 2014b).
These politics can be discussed in a number of ways,
but for the purposes of this article, we will focus on two
interrelated issues: the first seeks to interrogate how
that discursive construct actively glosses over material
and lived inequalities such as age, gender, class, ethni-
city that are also particular metrics used in the forma-
tion of the event (in terms of the demographics who are
invited). The second looks at the kinds of data that
becomes unavailable ­ the `waste' data; data that
cannot be `cleaned' ­ and so continually fails to frame
this data in an operational capacity: not only can
`waste' data not frame the subsequent prototypes or
products that emerge during the hackathon, such data
is also never referenced or acknowledged as potentially
framing ­ they are written out of the process of cre-
ation, the discourse that underpins it and the subse-
quent product that emerges.
For the hack events that were more consciously pol-
itically orientated ­ such as those organized by
MadLab or the ODI, the women only hack event, or
those run by the NHS that sought intervention into a
system of care ­ participants were carefully invited
along key demographic lines. They were chosen because
of their particular value: they were women, they repre-
sented a certain set of disciplines, they were users of an
existing system that needed changing, they had particu-
lar expertise or they were the ultimate users of the new
system that was sought. To a certain extent then, it is
worth noting that the demographic organization of a
hack event is also, in a similar fashion to `clean data',
written along a value system where key identity signi-
fiers are aggregated and afforded particular value. In
saying this, we are not drawing a direct correlation
between clean data and participant demographics.
Instead we are simply noting that the processes cri-
tiqued in relation to big data (see boyd and
Crawford, 2012) and data analytics (Han et al., 2011;
Kitchin, 2014b; Miller, 2010) which note the processes
of aggregation in the formation of data and along the
data points and `variables that have the most utility'
(Kitchin, 2014b: 101) are more widespread practices
than we might at first acknowledge. Similarly just as
the power relations behind these processes of aggrega-
tion are sometimes obscure, so hack organizers write
out their own intervention in their (later) narratives of
the socio-technical outcomes of the event and the spe-
cific contribution that these chosen demographics con-
tribute to the event.
The second point to make here is that many of these
demographics could neither find themselves in, nor
identify with, the datasets they were invited to use by
the organizers. We worked with obese families who
could not locate the complexities of their obesity
within the datasets they were offered (the datasets
pulled together income, class and age for example,
but not other health and mental health issues, family
relations, debt or education). We worked with not in
education, employment or training (NEET) groups
who appeared as unemployed and female and in
Leeds, but not (also) as being a primary carer or as
having a mental or physical disability, for example. In
other words, the datasets were always incomplete, yet
were presented as `clean' data to the participants. The
issue here is not about the completeness of a dataset;
the issue is that certain datasets were valued over others
within the parameters of the hackathon (presumably
for time, ease, cost, availability, aims of organizers,
etc.). At the same time the rationale for valuing certain
datasets over others was masked through a discourse of
`cleanliness', which worked to construct those datasets
as benign. The participants had to decide whether to
actively seek different datasets thus taking up valuable
time from the event or to use the available datasets. If
they did the latter, the elements that mattered to those
demographics (such as being a primary carer or giving a
percentage of income support routinely to another
family member) remained obscured in whatever they
built, or had to be retrospectively and consciously
added, while the discourse of `clean' data remained
relatively unchallenged.
Of course, participants have different stakes in the
hackathons and indeed the data they use, they have
their own politics and aims: the datasets were in no
way evenly taken up, but neither were they benign in
any way. As many researchers have noted, data is
uneven and wrought along political and power rela-
tions: data `depend on hierarchy' (Gitelman and
Jackson, 2013: 8); they are `correlated' in particular
ways to construct particular value (Mayer-
Scho
¨ nberger and Cukier, 2013: 70). Yet through the
discourse of cleanliness, malleability and openness,
the data was simultaneously constructed as the bedrock
for and of innovation or creativity (as fuel, a building
block, a terrain). We heard this kind of comment at
nearly every hackathon we attended: `This is non-raw
data, and it's clean' (Ian Holt, Ordinance Survey.
Thornham and Cruz 3
Digital Shoredich, 2014); `The data is clean, it's there
for you, its ready to use' (Leeds Data Mill Hack, 2013);
`I have a lot of really, really clean data for you. So it's
really easy to use' (Bruce Darling, UP London
Hackathon, 2013). Seen here, data was constructed as
central tools for the events, and better because data is
`ready' to use, speedier and can be automatically and
interoperably (computationally) aggregated.
The data was also constructed as open and transpar-
ent ­ and available for anyone to use (`programming is
easy, it's just a matter of `ifs' and where to put them'
(Leeds Hack, 2014), or `all I need is the data, once I
have that, its easy' (UP London, 2013). By comparison,
`raw' data required interpretation, sorting, translating:
they required human agency to make them useable. Our
argument here is that the discursive construct of data
writes out the possibility of interrogating the silences
within the datasets ­ the discriminations ­ and makes
the converse claim that, if anyone can use it, data actu-
ally promotes and enforces equality and openness.
These discursive constructions of data also reveal
huge investment in the creation of particular structures
in which and through which data can emerge: if `clean'
data is more valuable (or only `clean' data is considered
data) this goes precisely against the notion of big data
as `clean' representations of reality (see also Gitelman
and Jackson, 2013: 3; Manovich, 2001: 224; Van Dijck,
2014: 4). Discursively, then, there is as much investment
in the cleaning of data as there is in trying to demon-
strate that data speaks to/for itself. Data as `clean' dem-
onstrates the results of this investment, whilst also, of
course, obscuring the processes behind it (see also
Boellstorff, 2013).
During many of the hackathons we attended, par-
ticipants came up not only against data they could not
identify with, then, but they also came up against inac-
cessible datasets such as land register data, social hous-
ing data. The women only hack event (Newcastle, 2015)
for example, had an implicit gender politics that had to
be forged through the human and material. There was
also a concerted effort to `find' data relating to women
in the North East, but the data was unclean, patchy,
too `raw' to use. Instead, the participants ended up
using digital archive material or university material
that obscured class, age or geographic location, for
example. For the subsequent prototypes, this meant
that the politics of the data had to be retrospectively
and actively imposed through the material and human
interventions. In nearly every instance, participants did
one of three things: they turned to familiar data and
APIs (familiar through their own use ­ weather data,
travel data) or to social media data (twitter or scraping
tools that drew on social media data such as Klout6 or
Kred7) or they used the APIs made available by organ-
izations at the hackathon (ordinance survey data,
mapping data). For us, this further contributes to a
self-fulfilling cycle that perpetually reinforces the
notion of data as a priori, self-evident and truthful
not least because in these instances, then, it was
`clean' data that shaped what they built, and whatever
the original human/machine intention, the data that
was not clean did not register either in the process of
creativity or the final project.
These issues also reconfigure `waste' or `non-repre-
sentational' data (Clough et al., n.d.; Thrift, 2007) in
new ways. Indeed, even if we recognize that in the
hackathons, data was generative and conditioned the
possibilities for the activities and prototypes (Clough
et al., n.d.: 14; Suchman, 2007), we also have to recog-
nize they also created `silences' (Bowker, 2005: 11­12)
as well as the `absences of relations' (Kitchin, 2014b:
22, see also Vis, 2013) as we discuss below.
Data as datalogical
Many of the hackathon processes described above are
built on a wider, long-standing and normative con-
struction of data. Indeed as suggested above, the cen-
tral underpinning element that enables data to be
valued and operationalized in the ways described
above relates to the long-term construction of data as
`transparent', `self-evident', `the fundamental stuff of
truth itself' (Gitelman and Jackson, 2013: 2). In this
section, we briefly elucidate some of these issues in
order to suggest that this explains some of the power
relations and processes described above and their wider
iteration beyond data `itself'. We also suggest that, par-
ticularly with the advent of big data, the notion of self-
legitimating datalogical structures is gaining traction
with a number of implications not only for the subse-
quent valuing of the human and material but also for
wider issues such as expertise and knowledge which are
(re)located into the data processes. The irony, of
course, is that the conception of datalogical systems
as self-legitimating requires a huge amount of complex
(and ironically, external) discursive, human and mater-
ial elements to sustain it.
There are a number of accounts (see also boyd and
Crawford, 2012; Clough et al., n.d.; Gitelman and
Jackson, 2013; Manovich, 2001) that seek to under-
stand the long-term social, political and technological
trend towards a valuing of a system over an individual,
and the subsequent consequences for contemporary
constructions of (big) data as the foundation of that
system and as something that precedes information,
knowledge and wisdom (Kitchen, 2014b: 9). David
Graeber's (2015) work into bureaucratic systems
offers one avenue through which we can begin to under-
stand the long-term shift towards trust and value in
both the system per se and systems of metrification
4 Big Data & Society
and quantification on which and through which (big)
data emerges. Indeed, for Graeber, the history of bur-
eaucracy is the story of the Internet (2015: 163) and
following this, of big data; his work parallels Mayer-
Scho
¨ nberger and Cukier when the latter talk about how
datafication and metrification are age-old conceptual
tools of early civilizations (2013: 78). What these the-
orists have in common is a concern with detailing how
human trust and value has shifted from people onto
systems, and how this shift has further contributed
not only to the contemporary value in/of data and
big data in particular, but also how this shift increas-
ingly disables us from interrogating the system, com-
prehending it, or indeed, intervening in it (see also
Berry, 2014). Graeber remarks on how bureaucratic
systems have become (like big data) both indispensible
and incoherent. The difference is that bureaucratic sys-
tems have been (relatively successfully) critiqued
through (neo)liberalism and right wing politics of the
market (Graeber, 2015: 6­7); big data absorbs this cri-
tique into its logic as a modus operandi of the system.
Following this, the central issue for the purposes of
this article is how this long-term valuing and construc-
tion of data is operationalized into and conditions sub-
sequent value systems within the hackathon events. As
we discussed above, such discursive constructions of
data have material consequences in terms of what
becomes possible to build, to imagine or to utilize.
But this discursive construction of data exacerbates a
second critique levelled at hackathons around their pol-
itics. Irani has noted, for example, that hackathons are
exceptionally good at masking a neoliberal and entre-
preneurial politics in a language of innovation and cre-
ativity with similar consequences to those noted above
(in relation to data) in terms of the socio-technical and
material outcomes of hackathon events (2015: 2­3). As
she argues, this results not only in the active enforce-
ment of a kind of citizenship as entrepreneurialism, but
also that this is imagined and constructed as a positive
and productive force for social change (Irani, 2015:
2­3). For the purposes of this article, then such con-
siderations remind us that data operates within and
alongside a range of other powerful material and dis-
cursive signifiers that similarly `condition' and shape
the event; they also remind us that data is also becom-
ing enmeshed in a wider discourse not only of creativity
and innovation but also in the elision of these concepts
with that of entrepreneurialism. All of these concepts
work to disappear or negate an overt politics under the
guise of the hackathon event8 and its premise of
creativity.
The second issue, which perhaps draws a more direct
parallel with contemporary concerns around data,
relates to how the construction of data configures the
human or material elements within the hackathon.
Indeed, if we consider the way the human and material
are conceived by organizers of events, this becomes
clearer. Hackathon events are carefully structured
with delineated challenges, discussions, scenarios and
research and build times written into them (see also
Go
´ mez Cruz and Thornham, 2016; Leckhart, 2012).
Irani (2015) describes the design of (particularly cor-
porate) hackathons as wrought with the politics of
speed and vision (2015: 19) and this means that,
although there may be an overt discussion of techno-
logical or material `play' or even `failure' (when ideas
don't work), in reality and because of the temporal
conditions of the events (with strict and rapid times
that are conducive to the notion of fast innovation);
failure, experimentation, labour and play are very min-
imal activities within the scope of the hack.9 Instead, as
we have observed again and again, discussion is rapidly
followed by build ­ and the build is, because it is both
material and human, necessarily the slowest element of
an event that prioritizes speed not only through the
temporal dimensions of the event itself, but also
because of the construction of big data as framing the
conditions of, and possibilities for, the event. While we
explore this in more detail below in terms of the pro-
cesses of hack events, the issue we want to note here
relates to the way disruption, failure, compromise and
frustration are all constructed as wholly human, as
slow, and as a kind of necessary evil of the events.
Partly these conceptions emerge from the construction
of the events themselves as temporally specific ­ and as
necessarily fast. But they also emerge from the condi-
tions introduced by data (as the tool, the bedrock, the
grounds on which such events are possible). Data, by
comparison to the human and material is conceptua-
lized not only as clean, open, transparent and a priori
to inequality and discrimination but data is also fast.10
This is further conflated by what we referred to earlier
as self-legitimating datalogical structures that not only
position the human and material as separate from such
structures, but also as increasingly unnecessary ­ at
least in terms of legitimation or in terms of the gener-
ation of meaning or agency. It is this issue, of course,
that has drawn the most criticism and concern from
theorists writing about big data (see boyd and
Crawford, 2012; Gitelman and Jackson, 2013;
Kitchin, 2014a, 2014b; Manovich, 2001; Mayer-
Scho
¨ nberger and Cukier, 2013).
Indeed, datalogical structures, by comparison with
humans, are constructed as dynamically adaptive ­ they
are both in a constantly fluid state and adaptively
responsive. Datalogical structures generate information
and have the capacity to build in response to that infor-
mation. They are self-referential and self-legitimating
(partly because of the necessary obfuscation of the
system see Berry, 2014; Graeber, 2015) and even while
Thornham and Cruz 5
the human element responds to them, they respond to
(through interaction with) the outside (human) envir-
onment (see Clough et al., n.d.: 7). This means not only
that datalogical structures and systems are self-referen-
tial and durable (to use Latour's term 1990) but it also
means that the frameworks for measurement and value
are forged in the system `itself'. It does not need legit-
imation or take-up by human or material agents: and in
fact, this process is never as good, as fast, as productive
as the system.
The final point to make here is in relation to the
discursive and material process of automation, then,
particularly in relation to knowledge and expertise.
Indeed, we suggest that the construction of data not
only as `a priori' (Drucker, 2011: 1) to information,
bias, value, but also as the underpinning element of
self-legitimating datalogical structure, conditions
knowledge and expertise in particular ways. If we add
wider constructions of smart technology to the concep-
tions of data already discussed in this article, we not
only have `clean' and `truthful' data, but we also have
clean and truthful data within a system that is conceived
of as `anticipatory' (Berry, 2014: 22), `dynamic' (Van
Dijck, 2013), `networked' (boyd, 2014): as `smart'
(Shepard, 2011). These are all terms that carry ideo-
logical weight and seek to elucidate the way that auto-
mation is shifting expertise and knowledge away from
the human and (back) into the system (Webster, 2014:
244). At the same time, the `system' is also becoming
normatively accepted as illegible (Berry, 2014: 14).11
Similarly, if expertise, knowledge and legitimacy are
increasingly and normatively located within the digital
system (rather than with the human), human capacity
for intervening into or critiquing it is also shifting ­
leaving us with a human (slower, less dynamic, less
adequate) mode of expertise, that is less capable of,
amongst other things, future thinking or planning. In
considering, then, the constructions of data as datalo-
gical, then, we also have to grapple with a very real
politics of data that is not (only) bounded by the experi-
ence of the hackathon, but is a much wider phenom-
enon that collapses our capacity not only of
intervention, but of future thinking, imagining and
planning; of expertise and knowledge into (to borrow
from Clough et al., n.d.) `the changing parameters of
computational arrangements' (Clough et al., n.d.: 15,
see also Sterne, 2015).
Data as materiality
The final consideration of this article relates to the con-
cept of data as materiality, which we understand in two
key ways. The first is through the transformation of
data into a tangible and literal material prototype
through embodied socio-technical processes, which
elucidate a range of tensions around what we call mun-
dane and ritualized practices and the discourses of data
already discussed above. This offers a more ontological
and embodied account of data reconfigured into the
specific parameters of a hackathon, as well as raising
further critical questions for concepts like creativity,
innovation and automation. The second way we under-
stand data as materiality relates to a more traditional
concept of technology as `disciplining' bodies
(Foucault, 1991, 1997) following scholars such as
Cheney-Lippold (2011) and Nafus and Sherman
(2014). Foucault's work explicitly connects metrics
and measurement of populations with disciplining and
measuring bodies (1997), which correlates if not elides
(for the purposes of this article) participant demo-
graphics with socio-technical capital (see also
Graeber, 2015). In the context of the hackathon with
its temporal and spatial frameworks and clear delinea-
tion of activities organized into specific events, this
notion of disciplining is a clear condition of the
events themselves that work to both enable and close
down certain embodied interactions and interventions.
These conditions, in turn, are centrally framed and con-
ditioned by data, in terms of the technical and material
conditions for hackathon processes. In relation to this,
we suggest that there is a clear correlation between data
and certain structures such as innovation and creative
structures like those pertaining to (and claimed by)
hackathon events, as well as to wider issues such as
research, knowledge and expertise. The convolution
of the datalogical turn, of course, is that data is increas-
ingly positioned as the condition sine qua non so that
despite the socio-technical and material processes dis-
cussed in this section, it is data that remains the power-
ful trope and condition of (and beyond) the hackathon
event.
On the one hand, data is transformed into a tangible
and literal prototype through established and familiar
practices that are enacted in the hackathon event as a
process of innovation or creativity. Indeed, within the
relatively rigid structures of a hackathon, we found that
participants necessarily arrived with established pro-
cesses, ideas or products that were rolled out in a new
environment, rather than entirely negotiated with other
participants and arrived at during the event.12 Indeed,
to create a new process of prototyping would be beyond
the usual temporal and organizational structures of the
event. This meant that social dynamics of the hacka-
thon converge with the particular time pressures, result-
ing in a rapidly emergent dominant idea and process
that was conducive to the data available and the socio-
technical conditions of the specific event (see Go
´ mez
Cruz and Thornham, 2016). Most clearly, this was
demonstrated through participants arriving with their
own kit: wires and systems, software, hardware,
6 Big Data & Society
speakers, sensors or recording equipment, weaving
looms, projectors, amps. In our observations, this kit
is adapted to the available data and the infrastructure
of the hackathon to produce for example: knitting code
that can be translated into sound code within an estab-
lished and created software (written by another partici-
pant) to be performed at the end of the event; sensors
that alter tonal register from male to female (or vice
versa), using spoken recordings from available archival
data; Apps with established design principles that are
made to fit the particular requirements of the event.
There are a number of ways we could consider this.
One interpretation relates to how we conceive `innov-
ation' and `creativity' as something more in keeping
with what Shaun Moores has called `unreflective,
taken-for-granted' (digital) corporeal movement and
process (2014: 202) where routine and everyday embo-
died actions occur in specific places and with specific
objects (see also Ingold, 2013; Pink, 2012). Seen here,
innovation and creativity are more about our mundane
and ritualized practices or relationships with techno-
logical objects and processes that are enacted across a
variety of contexts (see also Kember and Zylinska,
2012: 120­122), than, for example, novel and nego-
tiated socio-technical methods (Balsamo, 2011). To a
certain extent then, we might suggest that `innovation'
is better conceptualized as a change of context and that
the processes (the infrastructures) of innovation actu-
ally remain relatively unchanged. Alternatively, we
could argue that innovation occurs in the spaces
between the data and human ­ in the embodied prac-
tices of participants ­ that may also recognize the pos-
sibilities of human data agency within the structure of
the hackathon. From an organizational perspective, of
course, participants arriving with their own kit, expert-
ise or methods further underpins the necessity of ensur-
ing a particular demographic presence at hackathon
events not least because there seems a clear correlation
between participant demographics and socio-technical
capital as measured through the causal relationship of
participant demographics and final prototype (see also
Graeber, 2015; Nafus and Sherman, 2014). Indeed,
organizers of hackathon events (particularly those
working with digital artists) reiterated the importance
of the inclusion of particular skills and demographics
because of how this related to `innovation' and `cre-
ative' processes'13 as well as to a wider conception of
technology and data as implicitly (through embodied
subjective process) human. Indeed as one organizer
told us:
our hackathons have all been about treating technology
as something that can be dissembled and reimagined
not as black boxes that can't be accessed. . . hackathons
for us are about humans reclaiming technology as
human, taking it apart, claiming it for yourself.
(Uncanny Valley Hack, 2015)
While we are not suggesting these processes or relations
are transparent or causal, we are suggesting that within
a metrified and data-driven landscape, this interpret-
ation has particular traction. It also, in the wider con-
text of big data and self-legitimating structures,
suggests that we might be witnessing (as Clough et al.
(n.d.) and Graeber (2015) suggest) a much wider appro-
priation of bureaucratic and datalogical processes into
different contexts than we might otherwise note or
acknowledge.
A second interpretation of the data as materiality
relates to how we conceive processes of `innovation'
and `creativity' (and even `imagination' see Go
´ mez
Cruz and Thornham, 2016) as primarily data driven
(through both the framework of the hackathon and
through the methods and kit brought to the event by
participants) and what this means for embodied and
human subjectivities. Indeed, one argument we could
make within the specific temporal and spatial frame-
works of the hackathons relates to the ways embodied
participation could be understood as a particular form
of lived and embodied socio-technical action (even
agency) that disrupts the disciplining power of the
data through embodied mediation. Indeed, some par-
ticipants actively used kits as disruptive methods in
order to highlight the power relations, assumptions
and politics at work within the hackathon. Their par-
ticipation was in and of itself a disruption to the pro-
cesses, materialities, discourses and ideologies of the
events (see author). In this sense, we could argue that
the kits brought to events are disruptive digital­human
negotiations that intervene into the process of the
hackathon: they are familiar, routine and lived as well
as digital, technological and datalogical.
These arguments draw on a range of literature
within a longer trajectory of (feminist) STS studies
that investigates digital embodiment through concepts
like `intra-action' ­ entangled in and `intra' to the digi-
tal, technological and discursive (Barad, 2009); digital
data­human `assemblages' (Haraway, 2015; Lupton,
2016: 4), or the `body multiple' as a site to explore
lively data that is `ingested' or `emitted' (Mol, 2002,
2008: 402). All of these concepts think through embo-
died human subjectivity as data in relation to agency
and power. Indeed in relation to the hackathon, they
offer a powerful framework for enabling embodied
data­human agency whereby the data is corporeally
and discursively reconfigured through embodied
action. But as Deborah Lupton has noted, these actions
ultimately generate more data that circulates in a wider
`digital data economy' (2016: 4) beyond the initial cor-
poreal and lived processes. This is not to undermine the
Thornham and Cruz 7
potential of data­human agency but to note its tem-
poral and spatial contextuality. In the case of the
hackathon, it seems that that ontological expertise,
human everydayness and human­technological pro-
cesses of design are actually carefully and doubly
framed and contextualized by not only the rigid infra-
structure of the event itself (and therefore only afforded
bounded and embodied agency within the temporal and
spatial frameworks of the event), but also by the vari-
ous conceptions of data discussed in this article (data as
discourse, data as datalogical, data as materiality) that
continually and ultimately try to (re)position data as
the powerful force that continue to operate beyond
these boundaries of the hackthon in a wider data econ-
omy or datalogical system. This isn't always successful
­ in some cases the participants took their prototypes,
created their own narratives of the events, circulated
their activities in their own way after the event: they
resisted these processes. But even as this occurred, the
hackathons and their products were also being made to
mean in other environments, where they became evi-
dence of entrepreneurial success, claimed as innovation
or innovative practice (see also Irani, 2015; Leckart,
2012, author). Clough et al. understand this as this as
(re)organizing embodied practices in relation to the
values of the datalogical system, ultimately valuing
them (only) in terms of their capability of generating
data. Seen here the labour of the participants, their own
narratives of their activities and even their prototypes
are surplus to, or an aside from, the final product:
`bodily practices themselves instantiate as data, which
in turn produces a surplus of bodily practices' (Clough
et al., n.d.: 11­12). Given this, and to reiterate our argu-
ment above, the convolution of the datalogical turn is
that data underpins, frames and generates `innovation'
or `creative' practices. It is also ultimately positioned as
the condition sine qua non ­ beyond the spatial and
temporal lived conditions of a hackathon, and as the
generator for such bounded activities within a hacka-
thon event that can only ever minimally intervene into
the datalogical system which continues to be (drawing
on earlier arguments) faster, better, self-legitimating.
Our argument for the purposes of this article, then, is
that despite the socio-technical and material processes
discussed in this section, it is data that remains the
powerful trope and condition of (and beyond) the
hackathon event.
Conclusion
This article has explored data, discourse and materiality
through the specific lens of the hackathon in order to
interrogate the socio-technical and political configur-
ations they engender. What we have demonstrated is
that data, as self-fulfilling prophecies and self-
legitimating structures is discursively, operationally
and materially constructed as both the basis for, and
condition of, creative and innovative practices such as
those claimed within the discourses of the hackathon.
Perhaps more importantly in the context of this article,
these discursive, operational and material constructions
of data obscure and mask the enormous effort sur-
rounding data that is necessary to position it as self-
legitimating and self-fulfilling.
At the same time, and as suggested at the start of this
article, data and datalogical structures already have an
established presence in our lives. But what this article
has also attempted to demonstrate is that the claims
made in the relatively new field of big data ­ around
metrification, decision making, around infrastructure
and processes of organization ­ have a long-term tra-
jectory in terms of wider value systems and discursive
claims. This means that we not only have to recognize
events like hackathons within the discursive, ideological
and material parameters of (big) data, but also that
hackathons reveal that many of those parameters pre-
exist and condition the contemporary discourses of big
data as well. This highlights to us that the politics of big
data have a long term and normative base beyond data-
logical structures, and that the turn towards big data
has revealed these politics in new ways that similarly
make demands of us (see also Gitelman, 2006;
Gitelman and Jackson, 2013).
This last issue raises questions around the kinds of
demands that can be made around big data, not least
when human interventions are normatively positioned
as always already inferior. And our hope is that in
recognizing data as discursive, as datalogical and as
materiality we can open up a different space where
new demands of the digital can be made. But in relation
to this, we also have to ask about our own complicity.
Indeed, Caroline Bassett has recently critiqued our
`post-digital desire to accept the presence of. . .technol-
ogy as a given, but also to put it aside' in the explan-
ation of power (2016: 23). Her comment locates data as
already figured within discursive and material power
relations (and vice versa) but routinely set aside in
explanations of them. Indeed our interrogation of
hackathons reveals a very real discriminatory politics
at work in the infrastructure of the event, in the valuing
of data, in the participant demographics, in the claims
made about the value of such activities. At the same
time, these politics are simultaneously negated or dis-
appeared in the datalogical system, or located expressly
at the site of the human with lesser interventionist abil-
ity. In the end, then, the politics of data that are
revealed here as having much wider resonance beyond
a datalogical system demand that we consider and
question our own roles in the long-term normative con-
stitution of data. This is necessary if we are to move
8 Big Data & Society
beyond a simple acknowledgement of sociality as data-
logical with its corresponding disempowerment of our
own value, and instead seek interventions that move us
beyond our own complicity in being primarily and
ultimately reconfigured through the values of that data-
logical system.

Notes
1. Although we have participated in a number of variously
named and labelled events, and although we are aware of
the particular history the term `hackathon' evokes ­ some-
times uncomfortably for participants ­ we will refer to
these events collectively as `hackathons' for the duration
of the paper.

8. `it is just for fun really. There isn't a hidden agenda' (Up
London participant 2013); `this is about sharing, not show-
ing off' (Women only hack participant 2015); `we're here
to create and participate, not compete' (Digital Labs par-
ticipant 2015), `The most important thing is that there is a
real creative vibe here' (Leeds Data Mill participant 2014);
`they are just really cute ideas' (Intel judge, UP London
2013); `this is about helping the digital artist develop them-
selves and their own creative practices, it's not an industry-
funded event: it's not instrumentalised' (organizer
Uncanny Valley event 2015).
9. Or as Leach and Wilson have noted, creativity `appears in
a linear relationship to innovation' (2014: 13).
10. We could also consider here the way that the conception
of data as fast also apoliticizes the event not least because
the event is always already unable to intervene in the
datalogical structures by virtue of being too slow, but
also because by comparison to the data on which the
hackathon is built, the human and material contribution
is always already unnecessary, slow, behind.
11. Which we could also read following Graeber (2015), as a
long-term trend towards metrification imposed by
bureaucracy.
12. For example:
we were very careful to invite a range of expertise,
not just because this means more interesting projects
but also because it means everyone here is an expert.
This is not about making the next advanced thing, or
about showing off, but about sharing approaches
and perspectives and good practice. (Women only
hack organizer 11.15)
we need users and designers here to shape a useful
product. Their knowledge and experience is crucial.
