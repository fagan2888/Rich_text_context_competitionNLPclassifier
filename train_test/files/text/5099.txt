Article
There is now a large body of literature on intimate partner
violence (IPV) since the World Health Organization (WHO;
2002) drew attention to the alarming rate of IPV against
women across cultural contexts. Recent large-scale multi-
country studies have confirmed this by reporting higher
prevalence rates of physical, psychological, and sexual vio-
lence among women (Abramsky et al., 2011; Garcia-Moreno,
Jansen, Ellsberg, Heise, & Watts, 2006; Graham, Bernards,
Wilsnack, & Gmel, 2011; Hindin, Kishor, & Ansara, 2008;
H. Johnson, Ollus, & Nevala, 2008). The growing consensus
is that IPV against women is a public health problem that
should be tackled (Loseke, Gelles, & Cavanaugh, 2005;
WHO, 2002). Past scholarship has offered various explana-
tions for the occurrence of IPV against women, including the
view that IPV is a behavior learned during childhood
(Ehrensaft et al., 2003; Gover, Kaukinen, & Fox, 2008;
Straus, Gelles, & Steinmetz, 1980), or that it is the result of
personality disorders (Dutton, 1994, 2006; Dutton &
Starzomski, 1997; Dutton & van Ginkel, 1997; Holtzworth-
Munroe, Rehman, & Herron, 2000) or that it is due to the
influence of alcohol and other substances (Field, Caetano, &
Nelson, 2004; Foran & O'Leary, 2008; Snow, Sullivan,
Swan, Tate, & Klein, 2006). However, feminist scholarship
argues that male perpetrated IPV is a characteristic of strong
patriarchal attitudes/beliefs held among men that leads to
subjugation and violence against women (VAW; Dobash &
Dobash, 1980; Jewkes, Levin, & Penn-Kekana, 2002; M. P.
Johnson, 2006; Loseke et al., 2005; Pence & Paymar, 1993;
Stark, 2007). In Ghana, for instance, scholars have noted the
cultural predisposition of men and boys to dominate (Mann
& Takyi, 2009; Takyi & Mann, 2006), especially, husbands'
quest to maintain control over wives, which has sometimes
led to homicide (Adinkrah, 2008a, 2008b, 2014).

Correlates of Intimate Partner
Violence in Ghana
Paul Alhassan Issahaku1
Abstract
This study bridges a knowledge gap in existing literature by investigating correlates of male perpetrated intimate partner
violence in Ghana. Based on a review of literature, it was hypothesized that some sociodemographic factors would be
associated with the experience of male perpetrated physical, psychological, and sexual intimate violence in Ghana. To
examine this hypothesis, data were collected from a convenience but nonreferral sample of 443 women, using a structured
instrument. Descriptive statistics showed that 27%, 62%, and 34% of the sample, respectively, had experienced past-
year physical, psychological, and sexual violence. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, using some 15
sociodemographic factors as predictors. The analyses showed that women in rural settings had 1.71 and 2.20 times the
odds of experiencing psychological and physical violence, respectively; women who were younger than their husbands had
2.67 and 5.71 times the odds of experiencing psychological and sexual violence, respectively; women whose husbands were
unemployed had 2.41 and 2.58 times the odds of experiencing psychological and physical violence, respectively; women
whose husbands had nonmarital sexual partners had 2.10 and 2.33 times the odds of experiencing psychological and physical
violence, respectively; women who rated their health as good had 2.10 and 2.39 times the odds of experiencing psychological
and sexual violence, respectively; and women whose husbands did not appreciate them had 2.22 and 2.57 times the odds
of experiencing physical and sexual violence, respectively. Low education and polygamous marriage were also related to
psychological violence. Policy and practice implications of the findings are discussed.

IPV is a problem in Ghana, registering a high prevalence
(Coker-Appiah & Cusack, 1999; Ghana Statistical Service
[GSS], 2009; Issahaku, 2015) with a set of cultural beliefs
supporting it (Mann & Takyi, 2009; Takyi & Mann, 2006).
For example, in a national survey 33% of women reported
partner physical and sexual violence (Coker-Appiah &
Cusack, 1999). Again, the 2008 Ghana demographic and
health survey (DHS) found that 58% and 42.8% of women
have suffered physical and sexual violence, respectively, by
a current or former husband (GSS, 2009). Furthermore,
Adinkrah (2008a, 2008b, 2014) has analyzed spousal killing
cases among Ghanaian couples, indicating that in this society
IPV can sometimes lead to fatalities.
This article contributes to existing literature by investigat-
ing correlates of male perpetrated IPV in Ghana. Although
the seriousness of the issue has necessitated passage of legis-
lation criminalizing domestic violence (Republic of Ghana,
2007), we currently do not know, scientifically, what factors
are associated with IPV in Ghana, information that will
inform policies and programs to address the issue. The article
uses data from the administrative northern region of Ghana
to bridge the existing gap.
Literature Review
Unlike earlier literature which explained male perpetrated
partner violence as a behavior learned through experience
and exposure (Straus et al., 1980), or the result of personality
disorder (Dutton, 1994, 2006; Dutton & Starzomski, 1997;
Dutton & van Ginkel, 1997), or a psychiatric problem (West,
Roy, & Nichols, 1978), or simply the exercise of male power
and control--masculinity (Jewkes et al., 2002; M. P. Johnson,
2006; Pence & Paymar, 1993;Stark, 2007), the focus of cur-
rent scholarship is on identifying factors that correlate with
IPV so as to identify pragmatic policy and practice interven-
tions to combat violence. Correlates of male perpetrated IPV
are described as factors that are associated with increased
risk of perpetration or victimization. Several such factors
have been identified in studies conducted across different
national and geographic contexts. The following is a brief
review of the literature on correlates of male perpetrated IPV.
Correlates of Male Perpetrated IPV
Several sociodemographic characteristics have been identi-
fied as correlates that are associated with the risk of IPV vic-
timization among women. Depending on the social context,
some factors are more prominent than others as risk markers
for IPV perpetration/victimization, although some correlates
are common to most studies perhaps because these contexts
are fundamentally similar.
Alcohol use. Literature examining the association between alco-
hol use and male perpetrated IPV is growing. Studies in North
America and other parts of the world have found a significant
relationship between alcohol consumption and IPV perpetra-
tion/victimization. Several studies in the United States of
America (U.S.) identify alcohol drinking as a key correlate of
IPV (Fals-Stewart, 2003; Fals-Stewart, Leonard, & Birchler,
2005; Field et al., 2004; Snow et al., 2006; Temple, Weston,
Stuart, & Marshall, 2008). Field et al. (2004) in a U.S. study
investigating aggressive behavior, alcohol use, impulsivity, and
attitudes to domestic violence using a probability sample of
couples, found that 11% of 1,163 respondents who reported
alcohol use also reported perpetrating domestic violence and
those alcohol users were 3.2 times more likely to perpetrate
IPV. In two samples of U.S. men entering domestic violence or
alcoholism treatment, Fals-Stewart (2003) and Fals-Stewart
et al. (2005) have found that alcohol use is associated with
higher odds of frequency and severity of partner violence. Sim-
ilarly, in another U.S. study, Snow et al. (2006) found that
"problem drinking" was strongly related to perpetration of
physical violence (r = .17) and to psychological violence (r =
.23), suggesting that more drinking is associated with more
perpetration of violence. Outside of the United States,
Abramsky et al. (2011) have found a link between alcohol use
and IPV against women. In their analysis of data drawn from
10 countries involving a sample of 24,097 women aged 15 to
49, Abramsky et al. identified problem drinking as a key cor-
relate of IPV. According to the researchers, "In all sites odds of
IPV were higher in relationships where one or both partners
had problems with alcohol . . . " (p. 13). In another study
involving 13 countries, Graham et al. (2011) found that aggres-
sion toward a partner was more severe when either the male
partner or both had been drinking prior to the incident.Accord-
ing to Graham et al. (2011) although alcohol may not be the
cause of IPV, it can worsen the violent incident. However, not
all alcohol users perpetrate IPV and men and women who use
alcohol do not commit violence in equal measure (Giancola
et al., 2002; Graham et al., 2011; Graham, Plant, & Plant, 2004;
Thompson & Kingree, 2006). Therefore, it is not clear what in
alcohol predisposes users to aggressive behavior.
Age and age disparity between couples. Current literature sug-
gests that there is an association between age and IPV against
women. First, some research has shown that there is an
increased risk of violence in older couples (Luke, Schuler,
Mai, Thien, & Minh, 2007; Vakili, Nadrian, Fathipoor,
Boniadi, & Morowatisharifabad, 2010). Luke et al.'s (2007)
study of couple attitudes and marital violence involving a
sample of 465 women in Viet Nam found that there was an
increased likelihood of older men hitting their wives and an
increased likelihood of older women being hit by their part-
ners. Vakili et al. (2010) also found a significant positive cor-
relation between age of woman and IPV when they analyzed
data from a sample of 702 women drawn from an Iranian
county. Similarly, in an African American female subsample,
a U.S. study (Lacey, West, Matusko, & Jackson, 2016) found
that women aged 35 and above (35-64) were at increased risk
of severe partner physical violence. Other studies show that
Issahaku 3
age disparity is related to IPV, especially, that women are at
heightened risk of IPV victimization if they are younger (in
most cases, less than 30 years; Faramarzi, Esmailzadeh, &
Mosavi, 2005; Hadi, 2000; Hindin & Adair, 2002; Obi &
Ozumba, 2007). For example, a study conducted with 2,400
women in Iran (Faramarzi et al., 2005) found that younger
women (20 years) had 2.23 times the odds of experiencing
IPV compared with older women. Similarly, in his analysis
of data from 500 women in various parts of Bangladesh,
Hadi (2000) found that women who were less than 30 years
were at increased risk of sexual violence during pregnancy,
menstruation, and the neonatal state. However, a 10-country
study (Abramsky et al., 2011) produced mixed results on the
relationship between age and IPV. Abramsky et al. found a
strong association between younger age of women and
increased risk of IPV across the sites. But they also report
that older age of the woman was also associated with
increased risk of IPV. The findings on the effect of age and
age disparity on IPV are not conclusive.Although we can say
that both younger and older women are faced with increased
risk of IPV, the same is not suggested about IPV perpetration
among younger and older men. Luke et al. suggest that per-
haps because older men and women have been exposed to
the potential of violence for longer periods in their relation-
ships, they are more likely to report having hit or been hit.
Current employment status.Employment status of either or
both of the couple is an important correlate of IPV, with most
studies indicating that unemployment is significantly related
to IPV. For example, Vakili et al. (2010) found that women
who were not currently employed had a higher mean reported
IPV and women whose partners were currently not employed
also had a higher mean reported IPV. In addition, Faramarzi
and colleagues (2005) found that women who reported not
currently employed had 2.75 times the odds of experiencing
IPV. Similarly, a Lagos, Nigeria, study involving 400 women
(Onigbogi, Odeyemi, & Onigbogi, 2015) found that women
whose partners were unemployed had 5.89 times the odds of
experiencing sexual violence. Furthermore, in their study of
600 men from south-east Nigeria, Obi and Ozumba (2007)
found that among men who reported perpetrating IPV there
was a significant association between a spouse's unemploy-
ment status and physical, psychological, and sexual IPV.
Findings of a U.S. study using a sample of 848 couples (Cun-
radi, Todd, Duke, & Ames, 2009) support the fact that unem-
ployment of either or both partners increases the risk of IPV.
However, as Naved and Persson (2005) have found in a Ban-
gladeshi sample of 2,702 women, sometimes women who
are employed (earning an income) are also at risk of IPV.
Residential setting.Studies on correlates of IPV have found
that the setting in which the couple resides, rural versus
urban, makes a difference in the experience and/or perpetra-
tion of IPV. Some studies find that women in rural settings
are at a higher risk of IPV or that men in rural areas have a
higher likelihood of perpetrating partner violence. The work
of Vakili et al. (2010) is important on this point. Vakili et al.
found that women in rural residence showed a higher mean
of reported IPV compared with women in urban residence.
This finding corroborates what was reported by Haj-Yahia
(2000). In an analysis of data from two surveys involving
2,400 and 1, 334 samples of women, respectively, Haj-Yahia
found that, across these surveys, residing in a rural setting
was consistently significantly related to the risk of experi-
encing physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. However,
perhaps the effect of residence on IPV is context dependent.
This is because a study conducted in Chebu, the Philippines
(Hindin & Adair, 2002) found that women in rural settings
are less likely to experience IPV compared with women in
urban areas. This suggests that the effect of residential set-
ting on IPV varies from context to context.
Other correlates. A number of other factors have been identi-
fied as correlating with IPV in the literature. Four of these
that are of interest to the present study include level of (for-
mal) education, type of marriage (polygamous vs. monoga-
mous marriage), presence of nonmarital sexual partners, and
number of children in the marriage. Higher formal educa-
tional attainment is generally found to be a protective factor
against IPV (Abramsky et al., 2011; Haj-Yahia, 2000; Luke
et al., 2007; Onigbogi et al., 2015). These studies suggest
that increased formal education of both partners or of the
male partner is associated with a decreased risk of IPV
against women. Type of marriage correlates with IPV such
that women in polygamous marriage are shown to have a
higher risk of IPV victimization (Abramsky et al., 2011;
Onigbogi et al., 2015). Similar to a polygamous context,
research has shown that women whose partners have other
nonmarital sexual partners are at increased risk of IPV
(Abramsky et al., 2011; Townsend et al., 2011). Studies
investigating the relationship between number of children
and partner violence indicate that an increase in number of
children is associated with increased risk of IPV (Acevedo,
Lowe, Griffin, & Botvin, 2013; Obi & Ozumba, 2007; Onig-
bogi et al., 2015). For example, after controlling for other
factors, a U.S. study using a mixed sample (57.9% women;
Acevedo et al., 2013) found that participants who had two or
more children had 2.21 times the odds of reporting IPV com-
pared with those who had only one child. Although not found
in many studies, perhaps because they are not regarded as
important factors, polygamous marriage, presence of non-
marital sexual partners, and increased number of children are
important considerations for a study in a context like Ghana
where, among many cultural groups, these are almost the
norm rather than the exception.
Focus of the Present Study
Although some work has been done on domestic violence
in Ghana and the issue has received legislative attention, no
4 SAGE Open
research has explored correlates of male perpetrated IPV in
the country. The present study therefore contributes to
existing scholarship by investigating factors associated
with IPV in Ghana. Based on what has been found in the
literature, it was hypothesized that some sociodemographic
factors, including age, employment status, type of mar-
riage, alcohol use, residential setting, and level of formal
education, among others, will be significantly associated
with physical, psychological, and sexual IPV experience
among women. The study used data from a survey with
women in Northern Ghana to examine the stated hypothe-
sis, making it possible to see how the Ghanaian situation
compares with what has been found in the literature.
Study Context
The research was carried out in the administrative northern
region of Ghana. Ghana, formerly the Gold Coast, is a coastal
country in West African which shares borders with Togo, Cote
d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso. The population of Ghana is esti-
mated to be over 24 million, of which 51% is female (GSS,
2012). The research was carried out in northern region, one of
the administrative regions within the larger geographic area
known as northern Ghana. Northern region lies in a semiarid
savanna zone, with rain-fed single-season agriculture as the
main economic activity. The region, with an estimated popula-
tion of over 2 million (GSS, 2012), occupies 29.5% of Ghana's
total land mass, is the largest of the ten administrative jurisdic-
tions of the country, and is divided into 20 local government
areas--district assemblies. Custom and tradition in northern
region place a high premium on marriage and the family insti-
tution in which women are subordinated to men. For example,
although young men and women look forward to marriage and
family life, it is the man who should initiate the process, pay
the bride price and bring the woman to his father's compound,
and act as head and breadwinner (Nukunya, 2003). In addi-
tion, men have permission to take an additional wife whereas
the woman is expected to commit to one husband (Mahama,
2004). Again, in matters of inheritance and ascension to chief-
taincy positions--traditional leadership--men (sons and
nephews) rank ahead of women. This unequal placement of
women in relation to men in this society provides an important
lens to look at men's controlling behavior and violence toward
women. (A more detailed description of the study context has
been provided in another article by Issahaku [2015].)
Method
Participants
Four hundred and forty-three (443) women participated in
the study. These were recruited from outpatient popula-
tions at six district hospitals, using targeted sampling
approaches. As explained by Singleton and Straits (2005),
although targeted sampling is a nonprobability sampling
approach it is not necessarily purposive or convenience
sampling because it captures a cross-section of the popula-
tion of interest at strategic locations. Established ethical
guidelines suggested that institutional settings that provide
services to women are safe grounds to recruit women into
research on a sensitive topic such as VAW (WHO, 2001).
This guided the choice of district health facilities as recruit-
ment sites. Furthermore, the Research Ethics Board of the
University of Toronto advised that to ensure privacy and
confidentiality, participants be contacted at health centers
with daily outpatient populations large enough to provide
anonymity. Information received from the regional direc-
torate of health services indicated that these facilities
record an average daily outpatient department (OPD)
attendance of more than 300 people. Women, who visit
these facilities for their own health care needs or as care-
givers to sick children and relatives, constitute a substan-
tial proportion of the OPD populations. (Participants of
this study were not at the health centers to receive treat-
ment as victims of IPV. These facilities are not violence
support service centers and do not assess for violence as
part of the routine care.) At the selected hospitals, women
in the OPD population who were within the age range of
18 to 49 years and in intimate relationships were eligible to
participate in this study. (Most studies on IPV focus on
women of this age range because that is the period during
which many women are in active marital unions [see
Abramsky et al., 2011; H. Johnson et al., 2008; Kishor &
Johnson, 2006].) Posters designed to advertise the study at
recruitment sites were not used because it was feared that
doing so could attract the attention of men and possibly
jeopardize the participation of some women. With this lim-
ited publicity, the rule of thumb was that a woman should
be approached in such a way that no intruder would know
what was being discussed. Any woman willing to partici-
pate following a solicitation in face-to-face contact was
included in the sample. Recruitment was done concur-
rently with data collection. Data collectors did a more
detailed introduction of this study, emphasizing its purpose
and why they were the people being contacted as part of
the informed consent process. The consent process high-
lighted the overall importance of this study, the unique
contribution of the information they would provide, as
well as the potential risks and benefits to individual par-
ticipants. It also highlighted the voluntary nature of par-
ticipation and the right to decline participation or to
withdraw from the interview at any time without conse-
quence. At the convenience of participants, instrument
administration happened immediately following consent
or at a later time. All interviews took place in confidential
OPD spaces designated for that purpose by management of
the health centers. In all, 600 women were approached to
participate in this study. Out of this number, 443 women
agreed, resulting in a 74% response rate. (These details
have been provided elsewhere [Issahaku, 2015].)

Measures
Participant sociodemographic characteristics alongside mea-
sures of physical, psychological, and sexual violence were
the important measures for the study. Sociodemographic
measures were treated as the independent/predictor vari-
ables, whereas the physical, psychological, and sexual vio-
lence measures were the dependent variables.
Participant characteristics.The following characteristics of
participants and their partners were taken: age relative to
husband's--participants were asked whether they were
younger than the husband (yes/no); type of marriage (polyg-
amous/monogamous); number of years of marriage; number
of children in the marriage; years of education (participant's
and partner's); woman and her partner's current employment
status (employed/not employed); whether husband is a chief
(yes/no); whether husband drinks alcohol (yes/no); couple's
residence (rural/urban); participant's assessment of her cur-
rent health status (good/poor); whether husband has nonmar-
ital sexual partners (yes/no); whether husband appreciates
(commends) her for her contributions (yes/no); whether par-
ticipant belongs to any associations (yes/no); and partici-
pant's religious affiliation (Christian, Muslim, Other).
Measures of partner violence.The WHO's VAW instrument
(see Ellsberg & Heise, 2005), which has been validated for
wider use in developing countries and was part of Ghana's
2008 DHS (GSS, 2009), was adapted for this study. For this
study, the section on violence during pregnancy in the origi-
nal instrument was eliminated since the focus was on vio-
lence without reference to any event in the life cycle.
Moreover, three questions were added to the psychological
violence subscale, making it seven items in all for the present
study. The three items included refuse to eat your food, refuse
to communicate with you, and refuse to perform your family
member's funeral. These questions were added to the scale
because of the author's understanding of the culture and ways
where men use different forms of psychological abuse against
women. (Other researchers have made similar modifications
to the psychological violence subscale for cultural relevance
[see Naved & Persson, 2005; Vakili et al., 2010].) Following
adaptation, the violence instrument had 16 items in all.
Past-year physical violence was a six-item Yes or No scale
measuring physically assaultive acts such as slapping you or
throwing something at you that could hurt, push you or shove
you or pull your hair, hit you with fist or something that could
hurt you, kick you or drag you or beat you up, choke you or
burn you on purpose, and threat to use or actual use of weap-
ons against you. Past-year psychological violence was a
seven-item Yes or No scale measuring men's actions that are
potentially psychologically injurious. Examples include the
following: insult you or make you feel bad about yourself;
belittle or humiliate you in public; scare or intimidate you on
purpose; threaten to hurt you or someone dear to you, refuse
to communicate with you; refuse to eat your food; and refuse
to perform your family member's funeral. Past-year sexual
violence was a three-item Yes or No scale. They included the
following: forced you to have sexual intercourse, made you
engage in nonconsensual sex due to fear, and forced you to
perform something sexual that feels degrading. Reliability
analysis showed Cronbach's alphas of .72 (N = 6), .74 (N = 7),
and .61 (N = 3), respectively, for the physical, psychological,
and sexual violence subscales.
Data Collection
Data were collected as part of the author's doctoral disserta-
tion research. The major medium of data collection was face-
to-face interviews. Assistants interpreted the English
instrument in structured interviews for women who did not
have English proficiency. The four main local languages
used in these interviews were Dagbanli, Twi, Hausa, and
Gonja. On average, interviews lasted for 45 min. The data
collection team of 12 female assistants consisted of practic-
ing nurses, high school teachers, and upper-year university
students. Data collectors were trained in VAW research based
on the WHO's (2001) guidelines. They were also given an
orientation on solution-focused brief counseling to help par-
ticipants deal with emotions during the interviews and to
refer participants who needed further help. Participant safety
was taken care of by ensuring, among other things, the pri-
vacy and confidentiality of the interviews and ensuring that
experienced nurse practitioners were on standby to offer
emotional support to participants. Participants who could
read and write in English were allowed the choice of inde-
pendently completing the questionnaire.At each of the health
centers, an experienced female nurse practitioner was on
standby to provide support. Each participant received GHS 2
(two Ghana Cedis) as appreciation of their time and help
with the study. Protocols for this study went through full
review by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board.
Data Analysis and Results
Data were analyzed using the statistical package for the social
sciences (SPSS) Version 20. Frequency distribution, bivariate
chi-square, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were
performed to make sense of the data. Frequency distribution
analysis (see Table 1) showed the following: 46% came from
rural areas, 67% identified as younger than their partners, 35%
identified their marriage as polygamous, and 70% were cur-
rently employed. Other characteristics include the following:
mean length of marriage was 9.66 years (SD = 8.47), mean
number of children was 2.55 (SD = 1.87), mean years of educa-
tion for participants was 7.89 (SD = 7.67), mean years of part-
ner education was 9.14 (SD = 8.24), 66% of participants were
Muslim, 17% rated their general health as poor, 19% reported
their partners take alcohol, 20% reported their partners have
nonmarital sexual partners, 22% reported their partners were
6 SAGE Open
not currently employed, 25% reported they belong to an asso-
ciation, 11% indicated their partner is chief, and 27% reported
their partners do not appreciate. Frequency distribution of the
violence measures showed that 69% of the sample (N = 443)
had experienced past-year IPV, 62% had experienced psycho-
logical violence, 27% had experience physical violence, and
34% had experienced sexual violence (Table 1).
Bivariate relationships.Table 2 presents cross-tabulations for
the bivariate analyses. As can be seen, all the demographic
variables were significantly related to at least one of the vio-
lence measures at the alpha level of .05 or lower as follows:
Type of residence was significantly associated with psycho-
logical violence (² = 7.84, p < .005), physical violence (² =
25.53, p < .001), and sexual violence (² = 7.91, p < .005).
Woman's age relative to her partner's was significantly associ-

three measures not shown in the chi-square analysis were
included in the logistic regression models as follows:
years of education for participant and partner were dichot-
omized into 0 to 7 years = elementary/no education and 8
years and above = some/post-secondary education; and
number of children in the marriage was dichotomized into
0 to 2 and 3 or more children. The religious affiliation
variable was dichotomized into Christian and Muslim/
Other. Other assumptions of the logistic regression analy-
ses were met as follows: the outcome variables were
dichotomous, statistically independent, mutually exclu-
sive and collectively exhaustive, and the sample size (N 
400) was large enough to produce meaningful regression
coefficients.
Predictive models.Separate logistic regression models were
used to assess how the 15 variables predicted IPV. These pre-
dictors were type of residence, type of marriage, whether
woman is younger than partner, religious affiliation, whether
woman belongs to an association, woman employment, part-
ner employment, whether partner is chief, partner alcohol use,
whether partner has nonmarital sexual partners, woman's
assessed health, whether partner appreciates, partner educa-
tion, woman education, and number of children. These are all
dichotomous variables. In each case, the reference category
(dummy coded 0) is not shown in the logistic regression table.

employed, does not belong to an association, no nonmarital

Christian, no partner alcohol use, partner appreciates (yes),
some/post-secondary education, 0 to 2 children, respectively,
are the reference categories. For each predictive model the
nonsignificant Hosmer­Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic
supported the claim that the model was a good fit for the data.
The first model assessed how well the variables predicted
the odds of experiencing psychological violence in the sam-
ple. Model coefficients and related statistics are presented in
Table 3. An examination of the z (Wald) scores and the prob-
abilities suggests that the population correlation coefficient
is probably greater than 0 for at least seven of the predictors.
The coefficients for type of residence, woman younger, part-
ner employment, type of marriage, presence of nonmarital
sexual partners, woman's assessed health, and partner educa-
tion variables were statistically significant, indicating the
following: women who resided in rural settings were signifi-
cantly more likely to experience psychological violence, p <
.050, odds ratio (OR) = 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
[1.00, 2.91]; women who are younger than their partners
were significantly more likely to experience psychological
violence, p < .001, OR = 2.67, 95% CI = [1.58, 4.51]; women
in polygamous marriage were significantly more likely to
experience psychological violence, p < .041, OR = 1.73,
95% CI = [1.02, 2.93]; women whose partner was not cur-
rently employed were significantly more likely to experience
psychological violence, p < .016, OR = 2.41, 95% CI = [1.18,
4.95]; women whose partner had nonmarital sexual partners
were significantly more likely to experience psychological
violence, p < .023, OR = 2.06, 95% CI = [1.10, 3.85]; women
who assessed their health as good were significantly more
likely to experience psychological violence, p < .030, OR =
2.10, 95% CI = [1.10, 4.10]; and women whose partner had
elementary/no education were significantly more likely to
experience psychological violence, p < .035, OR = 2.07,
95% CI = [1.05, 4.10].
Next, a model predicting the odds of experiencing physi-
cal violence in the sample was established. Model coefficients
and related statistics are presented in Table 4. An examination
of the z (Wald) scores and the probabilities suggests that the
population correlation coefficient is probably greater than 0
for at least four of the predictors. The coefficients for type of
residence, partner employment, presence of nonmarital part-
ners, and partner appreciation variables were statistically sig-
nificant, indicating that women residing in rural setting were
significantly more likely to experience physical violence, p <
.015, OR = 2.20, 95% CI = [1.16, 4.18]; women whose part-
ner was not currently employed were significantly more
likely to experience physical violence, p < .010, OR = 2.58,
95% CI = [1.26, 5.29]; women whose partner had nonmarital
sexual partners were significantly more likely to experience
physical violence, p < .012, OR = 2.33, 95% CI = [1.20, 4.51];
and women whose partner does not appreciate were signifi-
cantly more likely to experience physical violence, p < .015,
OR = 2.22, 95% CI = [1.17, 4.22].
The final model assessed how the variables predicted the
odds of experiencing sexual violence. Model coefficients and
related statistics are presented in Table 5. An examination of
the z (Wald) scores and the probabilities suggests that the
population correlation coefficient is probably greater than 0
for at three of the predictors. The coefficients for woman
Issahaku 9
younger, partner appreciation, and woman's assessed health
were statistically significant, showing that women who were
younger than their partner were significantly more likely to
experience sexual violence, p < .001, OR = 5.71, 95% CI =
[2.88, 11.33]; women whose partner does not appreciate were
significantly more likely to experience sexual violence, p <
.01, OR = 2.57, 95% CI = [1.40, 4.71]; and women who
assessed their health as good were significantly more likely to
experience sexual violence, p < .041, OR = 2.39, 95% CI =
[1.03, 5.52].
The results of the logistic regression analyses indicate that

partner employment status, partner's nonmarital sexual part-
ners, woman's assessed health, partner education, and whether
or not partner appreciates are the correlates of IPV in this sam-
ple. Women residing in rural settings had 1.71 and 2.20 times
the odds of experiencing psychological and physical violence,
respectively; women who were younger than their husbands
had 2.67 and 5.71 times the odds of experiencing psychologi-
cal and sexual violence, respectively; women whose husbands
were currently not employed had 2.41 and 2.58 times the odds
of experiencing psychological and physical violence, respec-
tively; women whose husbands had nonmarital sexual part-
ners had 2.10 and 2.33 times the odds of experiencing
psychological and physical violence, respectively; and women
who assessed their health as good had 2.10 and 2.39 times the
odds of experiencing psychological and sexual violence,
respectively. Furthermore, women whose husbands did not
have the habit of appreciating (commending) them had 2.22
and 2.57 times the odds of experiencing physical and sexual
violence, respectively, women in polygamous marriage had
1.73 times the odds of experiencing psychological violence,
and women whose husbands had elementary or no education
had 2.10 times the odds of experiencing psychological vio-
lence. In all three models, the relationship between alcohol use
and violence was not significant.
Discussion
Results of this study corroborate previous research on IPV
among women. Consistent with findings of studies in con-
texts similar to the Ghanaian society there were high rates of
physical, psychological, and sexual IPV in this study. For
example, similar to findings in multicountry studies which
show that prevalence rates of IPV among women range from
15% to 71% across countries (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2006) or
10% to 69% across countries (WHO, 2002), the rates found
in the present study were 69% overall, 62% psychological
violence, 34% sexual violence, and 27% physical violence.
These are also comparable with results of Vakili et al.'s
(2010) study in Kazeroon, Iran, in which 82.6%, 30.9%, and
43.7% of the sample, reported psychological, sexual, and
physical IPV, respectively. It is possible that IPV was under-
reported in our sample, giving that domestic violence is a
sensitive subject and coupled with the social norm in the
Ghanaian society which enjoins individuals not to discuss
the family's secret with outsiders.
Consistent with previous research on correlates of IPV,
our findings show that some factors do influence the risk of
IPV victimization among, with rural residence, woman being
younger than partner, partner having nonmarital sexual part-
ners, partner not appreciating the woman, woman assessing
her health as good, partner not currently employed, polyga-
mous marriage, and partner having only elementary or no
education increasing the risk of IPV. Our finding that women
in rural settings are at a higher risk of IPV compared with
women in urban residence confirms the work of other
researchers (Faramarzi et al., 2005; Haj-Yahia, 2000; Vakili
et al., 2010). The finding that women in rural residence were
1.71 times and 2.20 times more likely to experience physical
and psychological violence, respectively, corroborates Vakili
et al.'s (2010) reported higher mean violence among rural
women. It is not known for sure what links rural residence to
the risk of IPV. Perhaps isolation and the strength or other-
wise of patriarchal traditions may help in understanding the
link. It is possible that women in rural communities are more
easily isolated by their husbands than those in urban cities.
This is because most rural communities do not have social
and recreational centers and, perhaps there are only a few
friends for the woman to hang out with, making it possible
for men to easily confine and have their way with their wives.
Moreover, as Nukunya (2003) has noted of Ghana, perhaps
patriarchal tradition, which legitimizes a husband's author-
ity, is much stronger in the rural society. However, the work
of Hindin and Adair (2002) which more IPV among women
in urban settings contradicts our position. Indeed, Hindin and
Addair reported that women in the remotest of rural settings
were the least at risk of IPV. This suggests that IPV among
women may not be unique to any residential setting.
Our finding that younger women are at increased risk of
IPV is consistent with previous research (Faramarzi et al.,
2005; Hindin & Adair, 2002; Obi & Ozumba, 2007). In most
of these cultures, age comes with power and privilege and,
especially in a patriarchal society where men occupy a posi-
tion of privilege, the younger age of the woman relative to
partner aggravates her vulnerability. Therefore, consonant
with Faramarzi et al. (2005) who report that younger women
were 2.23 times more likely to experience IPV, we found that
younger women had 2.67 and 5.71 times the odds of experi-
encing psychological and sexual violence, respectively.
However, other studies have shown that both younger and
older women are at risk of IPV (Abramsky et al., 2011; Lacey,
West, Matusko, & Jackson, 2016; Luke et al., 2007).Although
women who are younger than their partners may be especially
vulnerable to IPV, what the literature suggests, generally, is
that IPV risk among women does not respect a woman's age
relative to her partner's. In societies such as Ghana, age is a
tool in the system of social-gender stratification based on
judgments of maturity, responsibility, and cultural role sig-
nificance (Mahama, 2004; Nukunya, 2003; Ortner, 1972;
Rosaldo, 1974), in which case a man is always "older" than a
woman because of the privilege attached to his sense of judg-
ment and social roles. As a result, perhaps women in general
and married women in particular are always under the disci-
plinary authority of the man, including his use of violence.
Our findings that women whose partners were currently
not employed and women whose partners had nonmarital
sexual partners had higher odds of experiencing violence
confirm previous research. The finding that women whose
partners were unemployed had 2.41 and 2.58 times the odds
of experiencing psychological and physical violence, respec-
tively, adds to the Nigerian study (Onigbogi et al., 2015) in
which women whose husbands were unemployed had almost
six times the odds of experiencing sexual violence. Perhaps
Issahaku 11
the association between male unemployment and IPV is
explained by the concept of "male identity crisis" (Bradley,
1999; Jewkes et al., 2002; Moore, 1994), which is character-
ized by feelings of vulnerability, loss of control, loss of
meaning, and loss of status arising from an imminent inabil-
ity to fulfill the role of breadwinner (Ehrenreich, 1995;
Mohammed, 2004). Under such circumstances "of threat-
ened egotism" (Baumeister, Smart, & Boden, 1996, p. 5),
men may use violence at the least provocation. Luke et al.
(2007) discussed this issue in terms of men's possession of
little resources or low status in their Vietnamese study.
Although not significant in our study, other studies show that
unemployed women are at increased risk of IPV (Cunradi
et al., 2009; Obi & Ozumba, 2007; Vakili et al., 2010).Again,
consistent with what has been reported by others (Abramsky
et al., 2011; Onigbogi et al., 2015; Townsend et al., 2011) are
our findings that (a) women whose partners had nonmarital
sexual partners were 2.10 and 2.33 times more likely to
experience psychological and physical violence, respec-
tively, and (b) women in polygamous marriage had 1.73
times the odds of experiencing psychological violence. A
context of nonmarital sexual partnerships is similar to polyg-
amous marriage perhaps only that nonmarital partners do not
reside in the conjugal home. Women in these contexts usu-
ally view each other rivals (Benneh, 1994; Kuenyehia &
Aboagye, 2003; Lamphere, 1974; Mahama, 2004).Therefore,
women whose partners have other sexual partners may be
challenging their husbands over the issue and get physically
beaten. Women in this context may also face psychological
violence in the form of insults, negative comparisons, belit-
tlement, and cessation of communication.
Other correlates found in the study, including the effect of
education, woman's assessed health, and whether or not partner
appreciates the woman are an important contribution to the lit-
erature. Our finding that women whose partners had only ele-
mentary or no education were at increased risk of IPV is
consistent with research which reports that increased educa-
tional achievement is associated with decreased risk of violence
(Abramsky et al., 2011; Ishida, Stupp, Melian, Serbanescu, &
Goodwin, 2010; Onigbogi et al., 2015). The relation between
education and IPV suggests that men with higher educational
attainment are perhaps more accepting of egalitarian values and
respect women's rights to personal safety from harm. In addi-
tion, perhaps men who have attained a level of formal education
understand the negative implications of IPV and are also aware
oflawswhichprotectwomenagainstdomesticviolence.Unique
to our study, and puzzling, are the findings that women who
assessed their health as good and women whose partner did not
appreciate them were at increased risk of IPV. The effect of
woman's health on IPV in our study can be likened to the obser-
vation in other studies that when women control resources and
decision making they are at increased risk of violence (Hindin
& Adair, 2002). Because health is wealth and wealth is strength
perhaps women who assess their health as good act tough, chal-
lenge conservative male perceptions of women as the weaker
sex, and appear threatening to men who use violence to feel in
control. It is also possible that in the social context of our study
men selectively beat or sexually abuse healthy women to avoid
responsibility for any serious repercussions. Our finding that if
a partner does not appreciate the woman she is at increased risk
of IPV is also consistent with the finding that even when women
are working and contributing income to support the family they
are still at risk of violence (Abramsky et al., 2011; Naved &
Persson, 2005). Indeed, dual-earner families are now the norm
rather than the exception (Bradley, 1999). Hence, in addition to
their child care and homecare work, most women are out there
working to contribute income to their families.As a result, non-
appreciation of the woman is in itself violence and to follow it
up with physical and sexual violence is double jeopardy which
we can hardly explain. However, if men in this society have the
opportunity to establish sexual liaison with other women then,
perhaps it is understandable why they can afford not to appreci-
ate their wives.
Limitations of the study should be taken into account
when interpreting the results. The sample employed in this
study was regional, nonrandomly selected, and characterized
by a volunteer bias. In addition, the measures used in the
study were self-reports which are characterized by a response
bias and where underreporting is highly likely. Another limi-
tation is that we did not introduce any control variables in the
analyses. The noted limitations notwithstanding, however,
443 is a reasonably large sample and recruiting from public
places which attract a cross-section of the general population
of women ensured that some diversity was reflected in the
data. Therefore, given that there has been no prior empirical
investigation of correlates of IPV in Ghana, the study makes
an important contribution to the literature and has implica-
tions for policy and practice in the country.
Conclusion and Implications
IPV victimization is a serious issue among women in Ghana,
with nearly seven in 10 women experiencing violence at some
point in their marriage. This corroborates and adds to findings
of research in other contexts (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2006;
Vakili et al., 2010; WHO, 2002). The association between
some sociodemographic factors and IPV found in this study is
also consistent with and adds to existing literature. Although
not exclusive to them, women in rural areas, women who are
younger than their partner, who assess their health as good,
whose partners have other sexual relationships, and whose
partners do not appreciate them are particularly vulnerable to
IPV victimization. In a patriarchal society like Ghana where
men "construct women as legitimate vehicles for the reconfir-
mation of male powerfulness through beatings . . ." (Jewkes
et al., 2002, p. 1615), younger women, less exposed women
(in rural areas), strong/healthy women, and women challeng-
ing men over their extramarital escapades are at increased risk
of violence. For similar reasons, the risk of violence is higher
for women whose husbands have only elementary or no edu-
cation or whose husbands are unemployed. If postsecondary
education and a white-collar job enhance a man's social
12 SAGE Open
standing, then with neither of these he will have to assert his
place in relation to the woman by some other means which,
unfortunately in this case, is violence.
Findings of this study have implications for policy and
practice in Ghana. A number of such implications are outlined
here for serious consideration by government, civil society
organizations (CSOs), and nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) who are stakeholders and partners in promoting fam-
ily and community well-being. To begin, the age at which
young people establish marriage relationships needs a critical
review. Maturity in terms of self-discipline, personal responsi-
bility, and accountability for behavior should be factored into
the definition of legal age of marriage. If maturity comes with
education and young people need up to 18 years to finish high
school and enter college, then it makes sense to raise the age of
marriage to 21/22 years. However, although Ghana's law puts
the age of maturity at 18 years, it is not uncommon to find 16-
to 17-year-old girls in marriage. Indeed, in areas where polyg-
amy is practiced it is possible to find a girl married to a
polygamous man who is old enough to be her father. What is
seriously required, therefore, is concerted education and
awareness about the harmful implications of marrying teenage
girls or giving teenage daughters into marriage. Second, the
finding that women in rural Ghana are at increased risk of IPV
suggests that within the broader framework of tackling vio-
lence, rural areas be given special attention. In this regard, it is
recommended that (a) disparity in access to quality education
and educational attainment between rural and urban Ghana be
bridged, (b) education and awareness about the problem and
about laws protecting women against violence be targeted to
rural communities, and (c) perhaps the provision of woman-
friendly recreational facilities in rural communities will give
women safe spaces to break from the routine interactions of
violence with their husbands. The CSOs and NGOs who
already have a strong presence and influence in rural Ghana
can partner government and village elders in the education and
awareness drives and in providing safe spaces for women. A
third policy intervention suggested by this study is education
and awareness about the economic and social costs of polyg-
amy and extramarital partnerships. Polygamy and extramarital
partnerships are not lawful in Ghana, but they are not also out-
lawed. Indeed, as Islam permits men to have multiple marital
partners, Ghana cannot outlaw these practices. However, we
think that perhaps when men become acutely aware of the eco-
nomic and social costs of multiple partnerships they will
engage less in them and that will reduce the associated risk of
violence. As we have suggested elsewhere (Issahaku, 2016),
traditional and religious leaders who occupy positions of influ-
ence, including chiefs and their elders-in-council, Imams,
Priests, and Pastors would, in partnership with government,
CSOs, and NGOs, play an important role in the education and
awareness on the harm of multiple and extramarital partner-
ships. Finally, if women who assess their health as good are at
increased risk of IPV then, as we have suggested elsewhere
(Issahaku, 2015), we reiterate the need to encourage routine
visits to health clinics among women. At these clinics, in
addition to routine health checks, women would be assessed
and given support for violence and emotional difficulties. A
universal health insurance coverage would significantly
remove barriers to routine visits to health centers among
women.
Findings of this study also have implications for future
research in Ghana, two of which are the following. First,
there is need for a larger scale study employing random sam-
pling techniques to further investigate factors associated
with IPV in the country. This would fill one of the limitations
of the present study. Second, and perhaps more important,
future research should try to explain/theorize the relationship
between IPV and the identified correlates through qualitative
designs. This would enhance understanding of the mecha-
nism between these factors so that appropriate strategies
would be developed to disrupt the relationship.
