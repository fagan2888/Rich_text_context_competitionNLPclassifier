Introduction
The delegitimization of the public sphere implies that decent
people should avoid politics, or enter them only grudgingly, on
the grounds that "someone has to do the dirty work."
--Ghia Nodia, 2002
With the goal of unpacking the consequences of foreign-
led empowerment of civil society, a pilot program was con-
ducted through an international democracy promotion
NGO during the 2008 Georgian parliamentary elections.
The intent of the program was to increase civic engagement
and deter voter fraud by providing Georgian citizens with
information on (a) how to file a formal complaint and (b)
how an individual could monitor and change the voter reg-
istry. Programs were implemented in randomly selected
voting precincts, which allowed for the gold standard in
program evaluation methodology: a randomized controlled
experiment. The pilot program increased citizen activism,
evidenced by a 12% rise in registered complaints and a
moderate increase in voter registration.
While the intervention worked as intended, examina-
tion of the information campaign's effects on electoral out-
comes revealed an unexpected result: precincts randomly
selected for the "complaints" intervention had 5% lower
voter turnout than those that received no treatment. For
every person contacted, at least one person stayed home on
election day. In two separate replications of this result,
precincts that were randomly selected for a 2008 or 2010
pre-election panel survey--even if they received no addi-
tional contact with the NGO--had a voter turnout about
3% lower than precincts where no data were gathered. In
all three experiments, relatively innocuous interventions
induced voter abstention. Given that these interventions
are representative of standard methodologies used in
democracy promotion activities and social scientific
inquiry more generally, an in-depth exploration of these
unexpected findings may shed light on important and
under-reported political processes unfolding in the shadow
of democracy promotion aid.
An individual's decision to turn out to vote on election
day is typically modeled as a minimally costly action with
few direct benefits.1 Since rationalist approaches to turnout
typically depend on non-material inducements (i.e. "expres-
sive" benefits) to explain aggregate electoral participation, it

Abstract
What are the political consequences of democratization assistance to regimes transitioning from authoritarian rule?
By exploiting the downstream effects of a field experiment designed to encourage citizen monitoring of Georgia's
2008 parliamentary elections, we evaluate the political consequences of one type of democracy promotion aid. The
intervention increased citizen activism, but it also had the unanticipated effect of suppressing overall voter turnout by
approximately 5%. We hypothesize that the civic education campaign was interpreted as a sign of increased political
attention to a selected voting precinct, which suppressed opposition turnout. Two additional experiments provide
additional evidence for the hypothesis.

is plausible that in the Georgian case a small increase in
negative emotions--fear or disgust--on the part of study
respondents might have tipped the scales against participa-
tion among some voters on election day. In semi-authoritar-
ian contexts, some citizens believe that regimes can monitor
individual voting decisions and use the results to tailor retal-
iations.2 As a result, many post-Soviet elections resemble
"rituals of consent" ("voting in order to be seen voting by
anyone who might be interested in keeping track of who is
voting") rather than exercises in preference aggregation.3
These fears are not subject to easy falsification. They are
akin to a conspiracy theory, which can vary in potency
across different electoral districts within the same state or
county. We hypothesize that whether a Georgian voter
turned out to participate in the 2008 or 2010 election hinged
on individuals' self-assessment of two factors: (a) whether
the regime was capable of monitoring his or her vote choice,
and (b) potential personal costs of retaliation for voting for
the opposition. Our suspicion is that our intervention trig-
gered risk aversion behaviors: staying home on election day.
An alternative hypothesis to regime surveillance is dis-
enchantment with politics in general, as suggested by the
epigraph to this paper. Randomization of the content of a
2010 pre-election survey found that refusal to voluntarily
supply information was more common the more "political"
the survey instrument was. This finding was especially
acute in precincts rife with mistrust of regime intentions.
Perhaps citizens feared that the data being collected would
be somehow used against them. Or perhaps respondents see
politics as intrinsically "dirty," and viewed the activities of
the foreign-assisted youth who arrived from the capital
with some mix of pity and disgust. Regardless of the pre-
cise mechanism, these findings draw attention to a possible
source of bias in much of the survey data collected in semi-
authoritarian regimes on politically sensitive subjects.
Local context: The Georgian case
Georgia is a post-Soviet state that enjoys an unusually
strong strategic relationship with the United States. It
receives more Western aid per capita than the rest of the
states in the region combined.4 In 2003, peaceful protests
swept Eduard Shevardnadze and his regime from power
when exit polls did not match official vote tallies.5 In the
wake of the "Rose Revolution," the next president, Mikheil
Saakashvili, allowed the Soros Foundation, NDI, IRI,
Transparency International, and various other democracy
promotion organizations freedom of action.
At the time of the study Saakashvili's party, the United
National Movement (UNM), dominated the political land-
scape by using formal institutions--notably the judiciary,
the Ministry of Interior, and Parliament--to discourage
electoral alternatives.6 As president, Saakashvili enjoyed
favorable media coverage and free time on state television
networks. In a pre-election survey conducted in the lead-up
to the 2008 parliamentary election, 32% of voters reported
that people had to "vote a certain way to keep their jobs."An
additional 34% of voters admitted that this happens "some-
times."7 For all the disappointments of the post-Rose
Revolution era, however, Saakashvili's decision to concede
electoral defeat to Bidzina Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream
party in 2012 represents the clearest example of a party in
post-Soviet Eurasia losing an election and voluntarily step-
ping down from power.8
Two facets of the 2008 Parliamentary election deserve
special note. First, the election was conducted in an atmos-
phere of paranoia and conspiracy. Many voters believed
the integrity of the secret ballot was compromised. It was
taken for granted by Georgian media outlets that authori-
ties could figure out how constituents voted, and tailor
rewards or punishments accordingly.9 This is borne out in
survey data. According to a nationally representative
household survey conducted in the Spring of 2009, only
50.1% of voters believed that their vote was secret in last
Georgian election--a far lower figure than was reported
for the same question in either Armenia (72.8%) or
Azerbaijan (62.8%).10 Second, little distinguished the vari-
ous opposition parties in terms of ideology or policy pro-
posals. Voters generally went to the polls to either affirm or
reject the status quo--to either vote vote for or against
Saakashvili's UNM party.
Program evaluation: Expected and
unexpected findings
In the weeks leading up to the 2008 parliamentary elections,
the authors worked with an international democracy promo-
tion NGO to randomize the precincts that would receive a
voter information program. The goal of this pilot program
was to educate Georgian citizens about common technolo-
gies of electoral fraud and--it was hoped--to deter voter
fraud by disseminating accurate information about how to
file an anonymous complaint. With the aid of the imple-
menting organization, we tailored the content of the mes-
sage to address types of fraud regularly reported to be
associated with Georgia's electoral environment. The pro-
gram was implemented by the Caucasus Research Resource
Centers (CRRC). The total program budget was just under
$10,000. Eligible precincts were those previously selected
as primary sampling units in a national panel survey on the
2008 parliamentary elections. Canvassers delivered the
message several weeks after the first wave of the survey. To
increase efficiency, precincts were grouped in blocks of
four, based on region, urban or rural, 2006 governing party's
vote share, and percentage of ballots cast between 5:00 p.m.
and 8:00 p.m. in the previous election, which election
observers use as a rough proxy of voter fraud (since ballot
stuffing tended to occur at the end of the day). Within these
blocks of four, two precincts were randomly selected to
receive the intervention.

Description of intervention
The pilot program studied an intervention designed to
encourage voters to report any observed problems on elec-
tion day to either local electoral officials or to well-known
NGO partners (with experience in election monitoring).11
The messages were delivered through a combination of
pamphleting and canvassing. In every treatment precinct,
approximately 30 households were visited by canvassers
and given a face-to-face oral message and a flier. Canvassers
also distributed fliers to roughly 80 additional households
in the precinct (2­3 neighbors per home selected). Given
that average precinct size in the experimental samples is
1151 voters and assuming an average of 2 voting age adults
in each household,12 we would have directly exposed about
20% of households to the message. The canvassers were
college students recruited from Tbilisi universities. Most
enumerators had substantial survey administration experi-
ence and training through the CRRC. The text of the mes-
sages are in the appendix.
Expected results: Enhanced civic activism
against electoral malfeasance
The intent of the "Complaints" intervention was to encour-
age voters to monitor local elections themselves, filing a
grievance if election regulations were violated. To check if
our intervention had this effect, we compiled data on com-
plaints of electoral malfeasance reported by prominent
election monitoring organizations. We use two dependent
variables: (a) a dummy variable for at least one complaint
filed by a voter in that precinct and (b) the raw number of
complaints filed. Results are presented in Table 1. We find
strong evidence that our intervention increased the propen-
sity of voters to challenge voting procedures on election
day. The mean difference across treatment and control for
the complaints dummy implies a 12% increase in the prob-
ability of a complaint being filed in treated districts. For the
models using the raw number of complaints, the point esti-
mate is 0.26--which is roughly twice the mean number of
complaints filed in all precincts in the sample.
Unexpected downstream results: Turnout
suppression
Subsequent investigation of the data revealed another find-
ing: a substantial number of Georgians did not cast their
votes on election day in districts selected for the
"Complaints" treatment, as seen in Table 2. The average
effect of the complaints treatment (unadjusted specifica-
tion) on voter turnout is about ­5.4%. We find a positive,

but small, difference in the ruling party's vote share (model
3 and 4), though the null hypothesis of no difference could
not be not rejected at conventional levels.13 This unex-
pected finding prompted additional investigation.
Turnout suppression effects of two
pre-election surveys
Given that the turnout dependent variable was not pre-
specified prior to the experiment's implementation, skep-
tics could reasonably dismiss the turnout suppression find-
ing as a statistical fluke. This section presents two partial
replications of the result, wherein two pre-election surveys
are treated as randomized interventions. Subcontracted
Georgian canvassers capital city visited randomly selected
precincts, asking standard questions about political beliefs
a few weeks before two separate elections. The 2008 and
2010 CRRC surveys had a multi-stage sampling structure,
with precincts as the primary sampling units. In 2008, prior
to the parliamentary elections, 85 precincts were selected
out of a total of 3019 precincts using sampling probabilities
(i ) proportional to the number of registered voters. Using
a virtually identical sampling procedure in the weeks prior
to the 2010 local elections, 110 precincts were selected as
primary sampling units for a similar political survey. The
unit of analysis for this "experiment" is the precinct and the
treatment is selection into the sample. To recover the aver-
age treatment effect of being included in the survey sample
on turnout and regime vote share, we fit a weighted linear
model of each dependent variable on a treatment indicator
variable and the selection variable, the number of regis-
tered voters. The weights are inverse probability weights,
where the weight for each treatment unit is equal to
1

and
the weight for each control unit is
1
1-
. Because the selec-
tion weights are known, incorporating these weights in our
estimation procedure allow us to recover unbiased treat-
ment effect estimates.14 Balance statistics for this design
are presented in the Appendix.
The results are reported in Table 3. In both the 2008 par-
liamentary election and the 2010 local elections, being ran-
domly selected for a pre-election survey had a statistically
significant voter suppression effect. The suppression effect
was slightly more acute in 2008 than in 2010 (a lower turn-
out of approximately 3% compared to a lower turnout of
approximately 2.5%). The results are consistent with the
effects of the complaints intervention reported in Table 2.
Potential mechanisms
Why did the three interventions lower turnout? The inter-
ventions could have lowered turnout either by changing the
behavior of Georgian voters or the functioning of the elec-
tions themselves. In the latter scenario, exposure to the
information or survey intervention could have deterred
would-be ballot stuffers, thus reducing the number of man-
ufactured voters and consequently reducing measured turn-
out. Ballot-stuffing and tabulation manipulation are
prevalent in the South Caucasus.15 In the 2008 election,
however, European election monitors observed only one
instance of ballot stuffing and the ballot counting proce-
dures were generally assessed "positively" (OSCE, 2008:
7). Under this scenario, political operatives--typically
allied with the ruling regime--would interpret the interven-
tions as increasing the probability of being caught and pun-
ished for breaking the law, thus deterring electoral
manipulation. According to this hypothesis, one would
expect the vote share for the president's party to decrease in
treatment precincts, as ballot stuffers would no longer gen-
erate the same number of votes for the ruling party. The
evidence for this implication of the fraud dampening mech-
anism is equivocal. The point estimates of the effect of the
complaints intervention (Table 2) on the vote share of the
presidential party is positive (albeit not statistically signifi-
cant), while the effects of the survey (Table 3) are indeed
negative (again not significant). Furthermore, it is not clear
why a precinct being selected as a primary sampling unit
for a survey would reduce ballot stuffing, since enumera-
tors were deployed several weeks before the election and
did not present themselves as election observers. Given the
weak theoretical rationale for attributing reduced ballot
stuffing to the "survey as an experiment" intervention and
the null results on regime party vote share, the case for this
mechanism is tenuous.

This table shows the estimated effects of a precinct being included in two different political surveys. The first survey was conducted immediately
before the 2008 parliamentary election. The second survey was carried out before the 2010 local elections. Treatment effect estimates account for
unequal probability of selection and control for precinct size, the variable used to sample precincts into the "treatment".
Driscoll and Hidalgo 5
Our favored explanation for the findings is that the inter-
ventions lowered the propensity of some Georgian citizens
to vote. Being surveyed has been shown to affect consumer
behavior (Zwane et al., 2011) in a variety of contexts and
several cognitive mechanisms such as self-prediction and
related priming effects have been proposed as explanations
(Rogers et al., 2013). The particular characteristics of the
Georgian political environment, however, suggest an alter-
native mechanism for our findings on voter behavior:
increased suspicion of regime surveillance, induced by the
unexpected arrival of survey enumerators, reduced political
participation. This mechanism is plausible given the wide-
spread disbelief in the secrecy of the ballot and the common
view that the government punishes political opponents.
Citizens in post-Soviet Georgia--many of whom came of
age in a totalitarian state--may misconstrue enumerators
from the capital asking about politically sensitive issues as
agents of the state seeking to gather information about their
political sympathies. These types of fears are frequently
expressed by Georgian opposition leaders. For example, in
2009, a Georgian opposition legislator claimed that
telephone calls have been made ... to people from a number
which is registered to a division of the Ministry of Internal
Affairs ... An unidentified individual was conducting a survey
from this number, asking whether or not they were planning to
attend the 9 April rally, whether they stood in solidarity with
[participants of] the rally and whether they would change their
mind if the opposition used weapons [at the rally].
(BBC, n.d.)
If visits by enumerators prime these sorts of fears, it is
plausible that even a small increase in the perceived risk to
the voter or her family could tip the scales against participa-
tion on election day.
Some evidence for this mechanism can be observed by
examining how treatment effects in the original "com-
plaints" experiment vary by perceptions of the prevalence
of electoral coercion, as well as the geographic location of
the precinct. We examined three main interactions: urban
precincts versus rural precincts, prevalence of employer
pressure to vote, and the degree to which employers pres-
sured employees to campaign.16 If the intervention was
indeed being interpreted as political monitoring, then we
would expect that the effect would be largest in rural areas
where machine politics is more entrenched. The qualitative
literature suggests that employment, particularly in the
public sector, is often used to mobilize supporters. To that
end, we examined whether, as expected, the monitoring
effect was largest in areas where survey respondents
reported that employer political pressure was highest. We
also check whether effect estimates are larger in areas
where employers are perceived to place undue pressure on
workers to participate in a campaign.17
The results can be found in Figure 1. The treatment
effects all vary in the expected directions, though only one
interaction--perhaps not surprising giving the low sample
size--is statistically significant. The intervention had a
larger suppression effect in rural areas, as expected. But
particularly striking is the "employer pressure to vote"
interaction, which is statistically significant at the 5% level.

6 Research and Politics 
In areas where relatively few survey respondents believed
that employer pressure to vote for particular parties was
widespread, the estimated effect on turnout is close to 0. In
areas with a high number of people citing employer pres-
sure as widespread, the effect estimate is ­12.7%.
Cumulatively, these patterns in the data provide suggestive
evidence that the intervention was interpreted by opposi-
tion voters as a signal that there would be increased regime
attention to their voting behavior on election day.
Politicized data collection and
non-response in 2010
In order to probe the mechanism further, we implemented a
survey experiment in the 2010 pre-election survey. Our
new question: Is the behavioral response of Georgian citi-
zens to a survey instrument different if the survey is clearly
associated with politics? Procedurally, we front loaded half
of the surveys with the "politics module" (treatment) and
placed these directed political questions at the end of the
survey for the other half of survey respondents (control).18
Every respondent was eventually asked political questions,
so if the hypothesized mechanism is correct, the survey
itself heightened concerns over regime surveillance in both
the treatment and control group. The advantage of the ran-
domization of module order is that one can observe if
Georgian respondents perform differently on surveys they
know to be collecting political behavior data compared to
surveys where this was suspected but not known.
The dependent variable in the analysis that follows is the
number of questions that the respondent answered "Don't
Know" or refused to answer.19 The average treatment effect
for the full sample can be seen in Table 4. Asking political
questions in the first part of the survey increased the num-
ber of "Don't Know" or "Refuse To Answer" responses by
an average of 1.7, which does not reach standard levels of
statistical significance.
Given that a variety of mechanisms could explain how
priming politics could induce higher rates of non-response,
we are particularly interested in heterogeneous treatment
effects: is non-response attributable to treatment higher in
precincts with greater distrust of Georgian political insti-
tutions and the ruling party? A complication is that it is
not possible to use individuals' responses to a question as
a covariate: all answers are "post-treatment." Since the
thrust of our argument is that respondents are reluctant
about providing data and answer questions strategically,
examining heterogeneity by individual response risks
conflating treatment with baseline characteristics.
Ecological inference provides a partial solution to this
problem: creating covariates, at a precinct level, based on
aggregates of survey responses that could divide precincts
transparently.20 It becomes possible to make generaliza-
tions about which communities are essentially UNM
strongholds and which communities do not believe that
Georgia is a democracy.21 Table 5 splits the sample by the
median value of the community level covariates and
then displays the average treatment effect within each
stratum.
Citizens were less likely to give answers to questions
on the politics-loaded version of the survey (treatment) in
precincts where many citizens also report they are not liv-
ing in a democracy, they don't trust the electoral process,
and they are mistrustful of the UNM.22 The specific ques-
tions with the the largest difference in non-response rates
across the treatment and control conditions also support
the favored hypothesis.23 The five questions with the larg-
est gap in response rates when the politics module was put
at the front of the survey are as follows, in descending
order:

In line with our theoretical expectations, front loading the
survey with political questions most powerfully affected non-
response rates on questions related to monitoring of electoral
practices, the credibility of the electoral process, and feelings
about opposition parties. The first and fourth largest gap in
response rates were questions that asked respondents to rate
particular opposition parties (Alliance for Georgia was a coa-
lition of opposition parties backing the main opposition can-
didate in the Tbilisi 2010 mayoral race; We Ourselves was a
single-issue opposition party focusing on the Abkhazia dis-
pute). The three other questions with large gaps refer to the
credibility of the electoral process--with particular reluc-
tance about monitoring, either via cameras and digital record-
ing devices or domestic election observers. We interpret this
pattern as additional circumstantial evidence that the more the
survey veered into questions of politics, the less willing
Georgian citizens were to reveal their opinions.
All of this may, in part, explain why neither area experts
nor Georgians themselves predicted that Saakashvili's UNM
party would be outmaneuvered in the 2012 election by
Bidzina Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream. Mullen (2012)
reports that 46% of people contacted for a NDI-funded pre-
election survey in the immediate lead-up to the 2012 elec-
tion refused to tell CRRC survey enumerators who they
were planning to vote for. He speculates: "[T]hat number
was based on fear; and fear had become an important part of
life under the UNM for many people. It was a fear that
would lead people to avoid taking risks that could have put
them on the wrong side of the authorities." But it is impor-
tant to remember that is also plausible that respondents sim-
ply did not see themselves in solidarity with foreign-funded
democracy professionals doing surveys. While fear is the
mechanism that we find most intuitive--and a mechanism
that fits neatly into both the rationalist voting framework
and anti-regime polemics--other psychological mecha-
nisms are plausible. Simple disgust is difficult to falsify, and
broadly consistent with the heterogeneous treatment effects
reported above. As Nodia's epigraph to this paper makes
clear, politics in Georgia are widely viewed as dirty work.24
The tendency to perceive politicians as corrupt, and respond
negatively and emotionally to misused political power, is
ubiquitous in democracies around the globe. The desire by
Georgian respondents to avoid dirtying themselves with
politics by avoiding it as much as possible could explain the
behaviors reported in this study.
Conclusion
In recent years a number of studies have used natural and
field experiments to demonstrate that the presence of interna-
tional actors--as election monitors, scientific observers, or
activists--can have a causal influence on local electoral out-
comes. Unfortunately, as this study emphasizes, it is likely
that well-meaning interventions are occasionally misinter-
preted. And while we are certain that our intervention inter-
acted in an unexpected way with prevalent beliefs in Georgian
society, we emphasize that our study does not allow us to dis-
tinguish precisely which inherited beliefs interacted with the
interventions to reduce turnout. Did the intervention acciden-
tally prime fear of regime monitoring? Or did it accidentally
activate ambivalence, reminding respondents of some other
distasteful aspect of Georgian political life? Future research
may be able to discover the mechanism at work.
The Rose Revolution is an exemplary case of civil society
actors nonviolently seizing control of the state apparatus. One
of the unforeseen consequences was a blurring of the boundary
of where the regime ends and civil society begins. Well-
meaning efforts by foreigners to strengthen civil society, in this
context, were likely interpreted by many Georgians as strength-
ening the state. While this study provides limited grounds for
generalization beyond the Georgian case, or even beyond the
Saakashvili era, inherited beliefs from the Soviet legacy--a
culture of bureaucratic compliance that is exploited by incum-
bent parties, expectations that private behaviors can and will be
monitored and reported to authorities, and a sense that the polit-
ical sphere is "dirty"--are ubiquitous in the region.25 Residual
fear of state surveillance is a common phenomenon in post-
authoritarian societies. This study should be seen as an invita-
tion for further research on how authoritarian cultural legacies
interact with the standard social science toolkit.
Unexpected results are not unusual in the nascent field
experimental literature on democracy promotion and elec-
tion observation. Hyde (2010), for example, reports the
results of a randomized evaluation of election observers in
Indonesia, where she found that precinct visits by interna-
tional observers increased the vote share of the incumbent
presidential candidate by 32%. Hyde (2010: 521) proposes
several possible explanations, but underscores that the spe-
cific result is "somewhat idiosyncratic" and unanticipated.
In a voter mobilization experiment in Uganda, Ferree et al.
(2011) unexpectedly found that increasing the salience of
8 Research and Politics 
the visibility of voting suppressed turnout, particularly
among women. These results highlight one of the strengths
of field experiments in that they enable researchers to
uncover unanticipated effects of interventions. But these
results also point to our incomplete knowledge about how
interventions common in democracy promotion activities
interact with local political practices and cultural beliefs.
This study has policy implications. Investments in
improving the secrecy of the ballot--and then funding a
public information campaign to publicize this fact--would
probably indirectly empower opposition parties by reduc-
ing the perceived risks from regime surveillance. But pri-
marily these findings represent a sobering reminder that
U.S. policy ambitions outstrip the current state of knowl-
edge on how foreign assistance can alter the relationship
between the state and civil society.Ahealthy dose of humil-
ity is justified. While aggregate analysis of democratization
aid have found positive effects on democracy indices
(Finkel et al., 2008), our results suggest that the conse-
quences of any particular program can be highly heteroge-
neous and dependent on hard-to-measure local factors,
particularly in countries just emerging from long bouts of
authoritarian rule. There is much that we do not know about
the technologies used by electoral authoritarian regimes to
conduct elections in an environment that keeps citizens
insecure, atomized, and dependent on the party in power.

Notes
1. Arguments from psychology and sociology have been for-
malized, tested, and refined to enrich this rationalist account.
For a synthesis and formalization of the literature on voter
behavior in fully consolidated democracies see Gerber et al.
(2008). Brody and Page (1973) and Anderson and Glomm
(1992) discuss the decision to abstain strategically rather
than vote for an "alienating" party in the American context.
2. The journalist Thomas Friedman often told the following
joke: "A minister goes to the Syrian dictator Hafez Assad
after a national election. Minister: I have excellent news, Mr.
President! You won 98.6% of the vote in the election! Less
than 2% of the people dissented! What more could you pos-
sibly want? Assad: Their names." Like much black humor, it
draws attention to a set of rational fears that are not remotely
funny for citizens born into authoritarian rule. This intuition
is formalized in Stokes (2005), who provides a seminal model
that parameterizes machine ability to monitor individual vote
choice. For the related model of "turnout buying," see Nichter
(2008). See also Wedeen (1999) Chapters 1 and 6.
3. The evocative phrase "ritual of consent" is borrowed from
Heathershaw (2009: 95).
 4. Jones (2013: 136­139) reports that between 1992 and 2010
Georgia received $3.37 billion in U.S. aid. Jones (2013: 244)
notes that after its war with Russia over disputed secession-
ist territories in the summer of 2008, the United States was
quick to pledge Georgia $1 billion in reconstruction and
development aid, and the European Commission promised
$500 million more.At the time that this study was conducted,
it was common for political scientists to describe Georgia as
an electoral authoritarian (Linz, 2000) or competitive author-
itarian (Levitsky and Way, 2002) political system. Still,
the year before the experiment was implemented, the 2007
"Nations in Transition" data from Freedom House--which
ranks every post-Socialist nation on a 1­8 scale from most to
least democratic on 8 different dimensions--rated Georgia at
4.68, the most democratic of the eight post-Soviet states of
Central Asia and the Caucasus (the average score of all eight
states in this region was 5.96).
5. The late Shevardnadze era was eloquently described as
"Potemkin Democracy" by King (2001). The events of the
Rose Revolution are described in Wheatley (2005: 181­
209). See also De Wall (2005), Nodia and Scholtbach (2006),
Areshidze (2007), and Wheatley and Zürcher (2008).
 6. When votes were counted after the 2008 Parliamentary elections,
the UNM, controlled 119 seats in the 150 member parliament--
a very comfortable cushion of safety above the 100 votes that
would be necessary to rewrite the constitution. The second larg-
est faction--the United Opposition, consisting of eight small
parties and a few individual politicians--had only 17 seats.
 7. As shall be discussed below, the percentage of respondents in
a particular voting precinct that believed it was widespread
varied substantially. 23% of survey respondents in the aver-
age precinct in the study reported that these beliefs were
widespread, with a standard deviation of 22--which is to
say, in some precincts no one reported this fear and in others
it was the majority belief.
8. For a lurid English-language account of how UNM tactics
were portrayed at the time, see Fairbanks (2012).
9. Certificates were distributed prior to elections for electric-
ity, fuel, or food, with the implied caveat that they could be
invalidated by opposition victory at a district level.
10. The survey was conducted by the Caucasus Research
Resource Centers (CRRC) as part of their Data Initiative,
which seeks to gather comparable, nationally representative
Driscoll and Hidalgo 9
household survey data from Armenia, Azerbaijan, and
Georgia. 1837 individuals participated in the survey, with
921 (50.14%) reporting that they believed their vote was
secret, 345 (18.78%) reporting that they believed it was not
secret, and 501 (27.27%) reporting that they didn't know.
The remaining 70 individuals either refused to answer or did
not complete the survey.
11. A second intervention encouraged voters to check the public
voter rolls in the lead-up to the election, to ensure that their
and their families' registration status was accurate. This sec-
ond intervention was only implemented in urban areas and in
fewer precincts. Results from this intervention are presented
in the Appendix.
12. According to the 2008, Georgian households have an aver-
age 3.5 members, but this figure includes children.
13. Electoral statistics are from the Georgian Central Electoral
Commission. The President's party vote share is for candi-
dates of the UNM running for the single member district tier
of the national legislature.
14. This estimation procedure is equivalent to inverse propensity
score weighting with a known propensity score. Unlike most
applications using inverse propensity score weighting, unbi-
asedness of the estimator is guaranteed in this case because
the true propensity score--the sampling weights--are known
ex ante (Tsiatis, 2006).
15. These activities are almost always assumed to benefit the
regime (Tucker, 2007; Sjoberg, 2012).
16. The variables "political pressure by employer," and "percent
reporting pressure to campaign," are aggregated from pre-
treatment survey data. The variables are the percentage of
survey respondents that said the following phenomena are
widespread: "Voters feeling they have to vote a specific way
to keep their jobs," and "Employers forcing employees to
take part in a campaign."
17. For these variables, with the exception of urban­rural,
we split the sample into "high" and "low" samples by the
median. For subsample treatment effect estimates, we used
point estimates and their associated standard errors from a
regression model that allows the treatment effect to vary with
a binary interaction variable:
y T Z Z T
i i i i i i
= ( )
0 1 2 3
    
+ + + × + +  +
Xi

In this equation, Zi is the dummy indicator variable for
the subgroup, Ti
is an indicator for selection into treatment,
and 
Xi
is a vector of covariates.
18. The politics module for the 2010 local election contained
a standard battery of questions that contemporary political
scientists working in comparative political behavior use to
make inferences about likely voter behavior: questions about
past voting history, intended vote choice in the upcoming
elections, and the like.
19. This analysis excludes "cascade" questions that were only
asked of respondents who answered in a particular way to
a previous question. Summary statistics for the dependent
variable can be found in the Appendix.
20. When using individual level data to estimate heterogeneous
treatment effects, the same general patterns are found.
21. The questions used to construct the community level vari-
ables are: "In your opinion, is Georgia a democracy now?";
"On a scale of 1 to 5, where `1' means `Totally Falsified'
and `5' means `Conducted Very Well' how do you think the
local elections will be conducted?"; "Which party is clos-
est to you?" Community level variables are the fraction of
respondents who answered that Georgia was a democracy,
the fraction that rated the elections as a "3" or above, and the
fraction that stated that the UNM (Saakashvili's party) was
closest to them. Descriptive statistics for the community-
level covariates can be found in Table 10 in the Appendix.
22. The treatment effect is statistically significant at the 5% level
in two of the three substrata and statistically significant at the
10% level for the third. The interaction (i.e. the difference
between the above and below median strata) is statistically
significant at the 5% level in the case of the "Georgia is a
Democracy" comparison and significant at the 10% level in
the "Elections Conducted Well" comparison.
23. Treatment effects on individual questions are generally
small, even for the five questions with the largest difference
in response rates. The treatment effect on nonresponse for
these five questions was about 4%. While small in absolute
terms, the average non-response rate among control respond-
ents was about 8%, making the treatment effect an increase
of about 50% over baseline.
24. For a description of politics as "dirty," see Wheatley (2005:
180).
25. For a historically grounded explanation of why a wide
stratum of Georgian voters tend to see politics as dirty, see
Wheatley (2005: 5). For ethnographic observations on post-
totalitarian behaviors, see Paxson (2005) and Harris (2004).
26. The restriction to urban precincts for the voters list interven-
tion was determined before randomization.

Appendix
Data and methods
To examine the effects of our intervention we employ multi-
ple sets of data: administrative data (collected at the precinct
level) and individual panel survey data (aggregated to the pre-
cinct level). Administrative data includes voting behaviors,
changes to the voter lists, and registered official complaints of
election day malfeasance. Panel data provides a rich set of
variables that we can employ to probe hypothesized causal
mechanisms. We aggregate the survey data to the precinct
level, which allows us to examine treatment effect interac-
tions with theoretically interesting pre-treatment covariates.
Electoral statistics are from the Georgian Central
Electoral Commission and complaints data was compiled
by from the electoral authorities and various election moni-
toring NGOs. The President's party vote share is for candi-
dates of the UNM running for the single member district
tier of the national legislature.
We present treatment effect results for a number of
distinct dependent variables: a dummy variable for
whether a complaint was filed with accusations of elec-
toral malfeasance in a precinct, the total number of com-
plaints, three different measures of whether a district had
changes to the voter list, voter turnout by district, and
percentage of votes received by the president's party by
district. To estimate the average effect of each interven-
tion on these variables, we employ a simple linear regres-
sion of the outcome variable on a treatment indicator, a
vector of covariates (in some specifications), and block
dummy variables:
y T
i i i i
= 0 1
  
+ +  +
X 
where yi is a variable measuring electoral outcomes
(complaints, voter list changes, turnout, or vote share) in
precinct i. Ti is an indicator variable for either the com-
plaints or voters list treatment, the 1 coefficient captures
the average impact of each intervention on the experimen-
tal population. Xi
is a vector of covariates (including
block indicators) and i is an unobserved error term. For
the specifications that include covariates, the adjustment
variables (by precinct) are the number of registered voters,
voter turnout in 2006, and vote share of the president's
party in 2006. In each case we present unadjusted and
adjusted results. The standard errors for the regression esti-
mates are calculated using White's heteroskedasticity-
consistent estimator.

control groups in the "Complaints" field experiment can be

Balance statistics
While randomization ensures unbiased treatment effects in
expectation, any given realization of the treatment assign-
ment may result in chance differences across treatment and
control groups. To check that randomization adequately
balanced background characteristics in both treatment con-
ditions, we present the treatment effect of both the voters
list intervention and the complaints intervention on

10 pre-treatment covariates in Table 6. Standard errors are
presented in parentheses. There were no statistically sig-
nificant differences between the treatment and control
groups on any of the covariates.
For the "Survey as an Experiment" design, we have only
a limited set of variables to check balance. Fortunately,
these variables are pre-treatment values of the outcome
variables. These are presented in Table 7. None of the esti-
mated differences across the treatment and control condi-
tions are statistically significant at conventional levels.
Voters list intervention results
The intent of the "Voters List" treatment was to encourage
voters to check their district voters list and make modifica-
tions if errors were found. To check if our intervention had
this effect, we used the complete national voter registration
database to track any alterations to existing entries in the
voter registry by precinct (such changes in address, updat-
ing erroneous information, removing names, or the like).
We examined three dependent variables: (a) the percent of
voters list entries that were altered at any point in the post-
treatment period, but before the election; (b) the percent of
voters list entries altered in the week after the intervention
(as recorded on 4 and 5 May); and (c) the percent of voters
list entries altered immediately before the election, as
recorded on 11 and 12 May. Results are presented in
Table 8. Due to logistical constraints, the voters list inter-
vention could only be administered in urban precincts, so
consequently these estimates are substantially less precise
than those from the complaints experiment and are not gen-
eralizable to non-urban areas.26 On average, the voters list
intervention, when administered without the complaints
message, induced an increase of about 0.3­0.4% to the
voter registry over the entire post-treatment period. These
estimates, however, are generally not statistically signifi-
cant, with the exception of the covariate adjusted estimated
effect on "Early Changes" (significant at the 10% level).
The effect appears to be concentrated in the days immedi-
ately after the intervention as the "Early Changes" coeffi-
cients are substantially larger than the "Late Changes"
coefficients.
