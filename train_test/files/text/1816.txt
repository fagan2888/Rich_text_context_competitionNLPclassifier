OBESITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH A
variety of poor health out-
comes including an in-
creasedriskforcardiovascu-
lar disease, diabetes, disability, and
mortality.1-5 Recentstudies,however,sug-
gestthattheobesepopulationmayhave
grownhealthiersincethe1960s.Forex-
ample,theprevalenceofhighcholesterol
and high blood pressure has declined
amongobeseindividuals.4 Additionally,
theinfluenceofobesityonall-causemor-
talitymayhavedecreased.2 However,not
all studies have supported this finding,6
andobesitycontinuestobeassociatedwith
excess mortality.2,6-9
These changes may be mediated, in
part, by improvements in medical care,
particularly for cardiovascular disease.
Increases in the use of antihyperten-
siveandlipid-loweringmedicationshave
occurred across weight groups but have
been especially large within the obese
population.4 If the physiological mani-
festations of obesity are increasingly
treatable, some of the negative health ef-
fects of obesity may be in decline.
It is unclear, however, whether im-
provements in cardiovascular risk fac-
tors and mortality have been accom-
panied by improvements in other health
outcomes. For example, the increased
risk for diabetes associated with obe-
sity has not changed4 and obesity con-
tinues to be associated with an excess
burden of disabling conditions.10,11 If
improvements in the health of the obese
population are due to primary preven-
tion efforts that reduce the burden of
disease, then obesity could become less
disabling over time. However, if im-
provements have been due to second-
ary or tertiary prevention efforts, al-
lowing people to live longer with
disease, the association between obe-
sity and disability may be increasing.

Context Recent studies suggest that the obese population may have been growing
healthier since the 1960s, as indicated by a decrease in mortality and cardiovascular
risk factors. However, whether these improvements have conferred decreased risk for
disability is unknown. The obese population may be living longer with better-
controlled risk factors but paradoxically experiencing more disability.
Objective To determine whether the association between obesity and disability has
changed over time.
Design, Setting, and Participants Adults aged 60 years and older (N=9928) with
measured body mass index from 2 waves of the nationally representative National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES III [1988-1994] and NHANES 1999-
2004).
Main Outcome Measures Reports of much difficulty or inability to perform tasks
in 2 disability domains: functional limitations (walking one-fourth mile, walking up 10
steps, stooping, lifting 10 lb, walking between rooms, and standing from an armless chair)
and activities of daily living (ADL) limitations (transferring, eating, and dressing).
Results Among obese individuals, the prevalence of functional impairment in-
creased 5.4% (from 36.8%-42.2%; P=.03) between the 2 surveys, and ADL impair-
ment did not change. At time 1 (1988-1994), the odds of functional impairment for
obese individuals were 1.78 times greater than for normal-weight individuals (95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.47-2.16). At time 2 (1999-2004), this odds ratio increased
to 2.75 (95% CI, 2.39-3.17), because the odds of functional impairment increased by
43% (OR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.18-1.75) among obese individuals during this period, but
did not change among nonobese individuals. With respect to ADL impairment, odds
for obese individuals were not significantly greater than for individuals with normal
weight (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.92-1.88) at time 1, but increased to 2.05 (95% CI, 1.45-
2.88) at time 2. This was because the odds of ADL impairment did not change for
obese individuals but decreased by 34% among nonobese individuals (OR, 0.66; 95%
CI, 0.50-0.88).
Conclusions Recent cardiovascular improvements have not been accompanied by
reduced disability within the obese older population. Rather, obese participants sur-
veyed during 1999-2004 were more likely to report functional impairments than obese
participants surveyed during 1988-1994, and reductions in ADL impairment ob-
served for nonobese older individuals did not occur in those who were obese. Over
time, declines in obesity-related mortality, along with a younger age at onset of obe-
sity, could lead to an increased burden of disability within the obese older population.

Furthermore, new cohorts of older
individuals may have experienced a
longer duration of obesity relative to
previous cohorts. The increases in
weight have occurred since the 1980s
across all age groups12; those entering
old age (60 years) with obesity to-
day are likely to have had a longer ex-
posure to excess weight than older
people in previous cohorts. The dis-
ability risk associated with obesity may
be related to cumulative exposure,1 be-
cause obesity affects disability risk not
only through cardiovascular disease
burden, but also through conditions
like arthritis.
Our objective was to determine
whether the association between obe-
sity and disability changed between
1988-1994 and 1999-2004 among in-
dividuals aged 60 years and older. A
previous analysis of trends in obesity
and disability showed a constant effect
of obesity on disability over time, with
disability increasing in both obese and
nonobese populations.13 This analy-
sis, however, was based on an earlier
period when disability appeared to be
increasing in the older population. It is
important to know whether recent de-
clines in old age disability14 have oc-
curred for all older individuals or have
been confined to nonobese individu-
als. Disability in this age group is of par-
ticular importance, given the current
context of population aging15 and an in-
creasing prevalence of obesity among
older-aged individuals.12,16 Further-
more, obesity-associated disability is as-
sociated with significant burden in
terms of both quality of life and health
care costs in this age group.17-19
METHODS
The National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Surveys (NHANES) are
cross-sectional studies of the noninsti-
tutionalized US population including
interviews and clinical examinations
conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics.20 In this analysis, data
from NHANES III (1988-1994) and
NHANES 1999-2004 were used to ex-
amine change in disability by body mass
index (BMI [calculated as weight in ki-
lograms divided by height in meters
squared]) category. We do not exam-
ine NHANES waves prior to NHANES
III because they did not include our
measures of interest on disability. There
were 5724 participants aged 60 years
and older during 1988-1994 and 4984
during 1999-2004 who participated in
the clinical examination component
(87.7% of participants).
NHANES collected information on
2 types of disability indicators: func-
tional limitations, which refer to re-
strictionsinbasicmovementability,and
limitations in activities of daily living
(ADLs), which represent the most se-
vere disabilities and reflect an individu-
al's ability to live independently. These
domains are conceptually distinct, as
functionallimitationsareintrinsictothe
individual (eg, ability to stoop or kneel),
while ADL limitations refer to an in-
teraction with the physical and social
environment to accomplish a task (eg,
dressing).21 For each question pertain-
ing to disability-related tasks, partici-
pants were asked, "By yourself and
without using any special equipment,
how much difficulty do you have" with
the particular task. Participants could
report having no difficulty, some dif-
ficulty, much difficulty, or unable to do.
In 2003-2004, a new response cat-
egory, "don't do," was added. For each
item, less than 1% of respondents se-
lected the "don't do" category, and these
responses were recoded as unable to do.
Sensitivity analysis found that exclud-
ing don't do responses as missing did
not change results.
Participants were considered to have
a functional limitation if they re-
ported much difficulty or inability to
perform any of the following 6 tasks:
walking one-fourth mile, walking up 10
steps without resting, stooping/
crouching/kneeling, lifting or carry-
ing 10 lb, walking between rooms on
the same floor, and standing from an
armless chair. Participants who re-
ported using assistive devices to walk
were assumed to have difficulty walk-
ing one-fourth mile and walking up 10
steps. Participants were considered to
have an ADL limitation if they re-
ported much difficulty or inability to
perform any of the 3 tasks represent-
ing ADLs: getting in and out of bed, eat-
ing, and dressing. Participants were in-
cluded if they answered at least 4 of the
6 functioning indicators and at least 2
of the 3 ADL indicators, which re-
sulted in 43 participants who were ex-
cluded for missing data on disability
measures. Sensitivity tests in which we
excluded all participants with any miss-
ing data or assumed that all such indi-
viduals were disabled did not change
results. Cronbach  for a summary scale
of impairment items indicated high cor-
relations among individual items and
acceptable internal reliability (=0.85
for functional limitations; =0.66 for
ADL limitations).
Unfortunately, NHANES includes
questions on only 3 of the 5 ADLs
typically used to define ADL impair-
ment22 and did not ask about bathing
or toileting, leading to a slightly
lower prevalence of observed ADL
limitations in elderly individuals
relative to other surveys.14 Neverthe-
less, we include estimates of trends
for the available ADL limitations as a
comparison for trends in functional
limitations.
Weight categories were based on
measured height and weight: under-
weight (BMI 18.5), normal weight
(BMI, 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI,
25.0-29.9), and obese (BMI 30.0).
Covariates included self-reported age,
sex, race/ethnicity (determined by self-
report and categorized as non-
Hispanic black, Mexican American, and
other compared with non-Hispanic
white), education, income, the pres-
ence of chronic conditions, smoking,
and health insurance status. Educa-
tion was coded in 3 categories: low
(12 years), 12 years, and high (12
years). Income was measured using the
poverty income ratio to account for
household size and inflation over time.23
For 11% of the respondents with miss-
ing income data, poverty income ratio
values were imputed using random re-
gression imputation.24 With respect to
chronic conditions, participants were
asked whether a physician had ever told

them that they had arthritis, asthma,
chronic bronchitis, emphysema, dia-
betes, congestive heart failure, a heart
attack, cancer, or stroke. Smoking and
health insurance were coded into 2 cat-
egories: current smokers vs nonsmok-
ers and no health insurance vs any
health insurance.
In the combined sample (N=10708),
326 participants were excluded for
missing BMI, followed by 43 for miss-
ing disability data, and 411 for miss-
ing 1 or more other covariates, yield-
ing a final analytic sample of 9928
participants from both surveys. Logis-
tic regression was used to model the
odds of having a functional or ADL limi-
tation (in separate analyses). Because
odds ratios (ORs) may overestimate risk
in common outcomes, we also pro-
vide risk ratios computed as the ratio
of the adjusted probability of disabil-
ity in the exposed group to the ad-
justed probability of disability in the
nonexposed group.
We examined the influence of weight
status on functional and ADL limita-
tions and the extent to which this re-
lationship has changed from NHANES
III (1988-1994) to NHANES 1999-
2004. In addition, we examined poten-
tial explanations for observed changes
over time. First, we considered whether
demographic changes, such as differ-
ences in age, race, education, or in-
come, accounted for trends in the as-
sociationbetweenobesityanddisability.
Next, we accounted for the changes in
the distribution of BMI in the obese cat-
egory by separating obesity into stan-
dard classes. Because the weight dis-
tribution shifted upward over this
period,12 it is possible that changes in
the risk associated with obesity sim-
ply reflect an upward shift in the BMI
distribution. We therefore estimated
risk for disability using separate obe-
sity weight categories (class I, BMI 30.0-
34.9; class II, BMI 35.0-39.9; and class
III, BMI 40.0). Finally, we exam-
ined whether changes in the preva-
lence of disabling chronic conditions,
smoking, and health insurance cover-
age for participants accounted for trends
in obesity and disability. The Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania Institutional Re-
view Board approved this study. All
analyses were conducted using STATA
version 8.2 (StataCorp LP, College Sta-
tion, Texas) to account for sample
weighting and elements of survey de-
sign.
RESULTS
TABLE 1 provides the prevalence of nor-
mal weight, overweight, and obese in
the respondents (after weighting) and
the prevalence of functional limita-
tions and ADL disability within BMI
groups. The underweight group was
omitted because of its small sample size
(202), which precluded meaningful es-
timates. The prevalence of obesity in-
creased by 8.2 percentage points over
time (P.001) from 23.5% of the popu-
lation aged 60 years and older in 1988-
1994 (time 1) to 31.7% in 1999-2004
(time 2). During both time ranges,
obese individuals were more likely than
normal-weight individuals to have a
functional impairment (P.001). Dur-
ing time 2, obese individuals were also
more likely to have an ADL impair-
ment (P=.02). Examining trends over
time showed that the prevalence of
functional impairment did not change
significantly among normal-weight in-
dividuals, but increased among obese
individuals from 36.8% to 42.2%
(P=.03). ADL impairment declined
marginally in normal-weight and over-
weight groups considered separately
and declined significantly when those
groups were combined (P=.02).
TABLE 2 provides characteristics of
the obese and nonobese populations
in NHANES III (1988-1994) and
NHANES 1999-2004. Obese partici-
pants were younger, had fewer years
of education, were more likely to be
women, black, and to have arthritis
and diabetes, and were less likely to
smoke. Education levels and asthma
prevalence increased in both the
obese and nonobese groups, but dia-
betes prevalence increased only in
the obese group.
TABLE 3 provides ORs based on lo-
gistic regression predicting the odds of
having a functional impairment or an
ADL impairment. The OR for the time
coefficient indicates the odds of being
impaired for a nonobese individual dur-
ing 1999-2004 relative to 1988-1994.
The OR for the obese coefficient indi-
cates the odds of being impaired for an

mal weight at time 1. Finally, the OR for
the obese-time interaction indicates
change in the association between obe-
sity and disability over time, or the
change in the OR associated with being
obese at time 2 relative to time 1.
Controlling for demographic char-
acteristics in model 1, we see that the
odds of being functionally impaired did
not change for nonobese individuals
from time 1 to time 2 (OR, 0.93; 95%
CI, 0.81-1.07), but increased 43%
among obese individuals (OR, 1.43;
95% CI, 1.18-1.75; OR=exp[ln(0.93)
ln(1.54)]=[0.931.54]). Accord-
ingly, we find an increasing associa-
tion between obesity and disability over
time. At time 1, obese individuals had
a 78% increased odds of functional im-
pairment relative to those with nor-
mal weight (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.47-
2.16). At time 2, the odds of functional
limitation for obese individuals were
2.75 times greater than for those with
normal weight (OR, 2.75 [1.78  1.54];
95% CI, 2.39-3.17). Hence, the OR for
obesity between NHANES III (1988-
1994) and NHANES 1999-2004 in-
creased by a factor of 1.54 (95% CI,
1.25-1.91).
The predicted probabilities ob-
tained from model 1 were adjusted for
age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and
income (FIGURE). The adjusted prob-
ability of functional impairment did not
change among normal-weight individu-
als (0.234 during 1988-1994 vs 0.221
during 1999-2004); the risk ratio of im-
pairment for normal-weight individu-
als at time 2 relative to time 1 was 0.94.
However, the probability of func-
tional impairment increased among
obese individuals from 0.352 to 0.438
for a risk ratio of 1.24 for obese indi-
viduals at time 2 relative to time 1. The
effect of obesity relative to normal
weight also increased over time; at time
1, the risk ratio of impairment for obe-
sity vs normal weight was 1.50, and this
risk increased to 1.98 at time 2.
Model 2 separates obese individuals
into 3 obesity weight categories (class I,
class II, and class III) to account for an
upward shift in the BMI distribution and
theincreasedprevalenceofextremeobe-
sity in the 1990s.13 All 3 levels of obe-
sity were significantly associated with
functional impairment, and this associa-
tion increased with increasing obesity
class. Individuals with a BMI of 40 or
greater had 8.68 times the odds of hav-
ing functional impairment relative to
thosewithnormalweight(95%CI,4.45-
16.91). The effects of both class I and
class II obesity increased between 1988-
1994 and 1999-2004, with the effect of
classIobesityincreasing1.31times(OR,
1.31;95%CI,1.00-1.72;P=.047)andthe
effect of class II obesity increasing 2.24

times (95% CI,1.48-3.38). However, the
effect of morbid obesity did not change
over time (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.40-
2.17).
Adjusting for chronic conditions,
availability of health insurance, and
smoking (model 3) reduced the OR for
class I obesity so that it was no longer
significant (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.97-
1.58). Class II and class III obesity con-
tinued to be associated with increased
odds of disability. Even after adjusting
for potential differences in other health
characteristics over time, the OR for
class I obesity increased by a factor of
1.37 (OR, 1.37, 95% CI, 1.02-1.84) and
the OR for class II obesity more than
doubled (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.29-

nificantly associated with functional im-
pairment except asthma and cancer.

failure were the most disabling chronic
conditions, each more than doubling
the odds of functional impairment.
Smoking was associated with in-
creased odds of functional impair-
ment(OR,1.44;95%CI,1.17-1.77),but
being uninsured at the time of the in-
terview was not (OR, 0.96; 95% CI,
0.67-1.38).
In terms of ADL limitations, model
1 shows that risk of ADL impairment
in obese older individuals was not sig-
nificantly different from normal weight
during time 1 (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.92-
1.88). Between 1988-1994 and 1999-
2004, the odds of ADL impairment de-
creased by 34% within the nonobese
population (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-
0.88), but did not change in the obese
population (OR, 1.03 [0.66  1.56];
95% CI, 0.71-1.51. Accordingly, the OR
for obese (vs normal weight) in-
creased by a factor of 1.56 between time
1 and time 2 (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.03-
2.36). At time 2, the odds of ADL im-
pairment for obese individuals were
2.05 times greater than for those with
normal weight (OR, 2.05 [1.31  1.56];
95% CI, 1.45-2.88).

The adjusted probability of ADL im-
pairment declined marginally in the
normal-weight population from 0.036
to 0.024, yielding a risk ratio of ADL
impairment of 0.67 for normal-weight
individuals at time 2 relative to time 1
(Figure). The probability of ADL im-
pairment did not change among obese
individuals for a risk ratio of 1.04. Be-
cause the probability of impairment de-
creased within the normal-weight
population but increased within the
obese population, the risk ratio of obe-
sity vs normal weight increased, from
a risk ratio of 1.28 at time 1 to 2.00 at
time 2.
After dividing obesity into 3 catego-
ries (model 2), only class II and class
III obesity were related to increased
odds of ADL impairment within the
obese population, and the time trend
was not significant in any obesity cat-
egory. Class II obesity was associated
with twice the odds of ADL impair-
ment relative to normal weight (OR,
2.11; 95% CI, 1.15-3.86), and class III
obesity was associated with nearly 4
times the odds of ADL impairment (OR,
3.96; 95% CI, 1.79-8.79; model 2). Ad-
justing for confounders further attenu-
ated the relationships between obesity
and impairment. Of the health condi-
tions considered in this study, arthri-
tis, diabetes, congestive heart failure,
myocardial infarction, and stroke were
significantly associated with ADL im-
pairment.
In additional analyses (results avail-
able from authors by request), we
examined changes in individual func-
tional impairment and ADL disability
items. We do not include these results
because the amount of missing data
vary across items, requiring analysis of
different analytic samples or exclusion
of 654 cases to identify a sample with
complete data. Furthermore, these
items are highly correlated, contribut-
ing to our confidence in using a sum-
mary score. For functional impairment
items, the largest increase in reported
difficulty was in walking one-fourth
mile, but difficulties increased in 4 of
the 6 items within the obese popula-
tion and decreased in each item within
the nonobese population. Although
the largest increase in functional
impairment was in walking one-fourth
mile, results are similar even if this
item is excluded. For ADL impairment
items, difficulties decreased slightly or
were similar for each of the items
within the obese population and
decreased in each item within the
nonobese population.
COMMENT
Our objective was to examine whether
the association between obesity and dis-
ability has changed over time in the US
elderly population. Despite recent im-
provements in cardiovascular health
amongobeseadults,4 itappearsthatobe-
sity-associated disability did not de-
crease during the 1990s. Using 2 differ-
entindicatorsofdisability,wefoundthat
thedisparitybetweenobeseandnormal-
weight individuals has increased over
time. The odds of functional impair-
ment did not change between NHANES
III (1988-1994) and NHANES 1999-
2004 among nonobese participants, but
increased by 43% among obese partici-
pants. Furthermore, while the odds of
ADLdisabilitydeclinedsignificantlyover
the 1990s for nonobese older individu-
als, it did not change among obese older
individuals.
For functional impairment, the
change in obesity-associated disabil-
ity risk was not explained by an in-
creased prevalence of extreme obe-
sity, as the effects of both class I and
class II obesity increased over time. The
association between class III obesity and
functional impairment did not change
over time. This group already had very
high disability levels in NHANES III and
it is possible that given the small sample
and limited power in this analysis, we
were not able to detect changes. For
ADL impairment, the change in obesity-
associated disability risk was partially
explained by increases in the severity
of obesity. Obese-time interactions were
no longer significant after separating
obesity into severity classes. Although
controlling for chronic conditions had
little effect on obese-time interactions
for either outcome, it did reduce the
main effects of obesity on disability.
Consistentwithpreviousresearch,we
found a decline in ADL disability
throughout the 1990s.14,25 These de-
clines are important because the small
percentage of individuals with extreme
disability accounts for a disproportion-
ate share of health expenditures.26 How-
ever,ADLdeclinesobservedinthisstudy
were confined to the nonobese popula-
tion, suggesting that obesity may be
slowing disability decline at the popu-
lation level and that obese individuals
may not be benefiting as greatly from
broaderhealthimprovements.Therehas
been significant debate about the ef-
fects of obesity on trends in life expec-

tancy,27 but understanding its effects on
trends in disability is important in light
of the impact of disability on both qual-
ity of life and health care spending late
in life.17-19
It is worth noting that the strength
of the association between obesity and
disability observed in this and other
studies1,13,16,18,19 is similar in magni-
tude to the associations between
chronic conditions and disability. In
contrast, we find no effect of over-
weight on disability, which is consis-
tent with other research suggesting
small effects of overweight on health in
old age.2 We tested for an interaction
between overweight and time to deter-
mine whether trends in disability dif-
fered for overweight vs normal-
weight participants, and this interaction
was not significant.
Two demographic trends deserve fur-
ther consideration. First, it is often ar-
gued that increasing education has led
to disability decline in the older popu-
lation.28,29 In this study, education lev-
elsincreasedovertimeamongthosewith
obesityevenmorethanamongindividu-
als with nonobesity. The proportion of
the obese population with fewer than 12
years of education decreased by 16.2%
in the period observed in this study
(P.001), compared with only an
11.3% decrease in the nonobese popu-
lation (P.001). Hence, controlling for
educationshowedanevenlargerchange
in the risk for disability associated with
obesity. This suggests that prevalence of
disability within the obese population
may have increased even more without
accompanying increases in education.
Second, more research is needed on
ageandcohortdifferencesinobesityand
the associated health effects. An in-
creased burden of comorbidity and dis-
ability among obese individuals at older
ages could arise from an increase in in-
dividual lifetime exposure to obesity,
leading to an expansion of disability
among obese individuals at older ages.
It could also arise from a decline in the
mortality risk associated with obesity,
which would lead to a higher preva-
lence of obesity at older ages. Recent re-
search finds that the prevalence of obe-
sity increased by 5.0 percentage points
in the Medicare population between
1997 and 2002.16 In our data covering
1988-2004, the prevalence of obesity in-
creased by 10.9 percentage points in
adultsaged60to69yearsandby5.9per-
centage points among those aged 70
years and older. In addition to an in-
creasing prevalence of obesity, we find
an increase in both the prevalence and
relative risk of functional impairment in
the obese elderly population. In addi-
tional analysis, we stratified the older
than 60-year age group into 2 groups:
aged60to69yearsandaged70yearsand
older. The effect of obesity on disability
increased over time in both age groups
for both functional and ADL impair-
ment, but not all increases were signifi-
cant, perhaps due to the loss of power
associated with age-stratified analysis
(available on request from the authors).
Furthermore,wefindthatthemostse-
vere type of disability (ADL limitations)
is decreasing among nonobese older in-
dividualsbutnotintheobesepopulation.
Thus,despiteincreasesineducationand
medicalinterventions,higherlevelsofobe-
sity in subsequent cohorts of older indi-
vidualsraiseconcernsaboutthedisabil-
ity burden in the future.
In interpreting these findings, it is im-
portant to recognize certain limita-
tions. First, although we attempted to
account for an upward shift in the BMI
distribution by disaggregating obesity
by class, this approach cannot ac-
count for increases in BMI within obe-
sity classes, which may be driving ob-
served increases in disability within the
obese population. Second, we rely on
self-reported difficulties in physical
functioning and ADLs rather than ob-
jective measures of strength or perfor-
mance. Unfortunately, these were the
only measures that could be com-
pared because NHANES performance
measures of physical ability were not
comparable across surveys. Although
reliance on self-reported measures may
underestimate prevalence differences
between demographic groups (eg,
black-white differences), it seems un-
likely to account for time trends in dis-
ability by obesity. Additionally,
NHANES did not include additional
ADL measures (bathing, toileting),
meaning that we are likely to underes-
timate ADL disability in the popula-
tion. The ADL disability levels of 4% to
5% observed in this study are lower than
the estimates of 7% to 8% observed in
the National Health Interview Survey
for a slightly older age group30; there-
fore, NHANES is likely to have missed
2% to 3% of ADL disability. However,
because we are observing trends, miss-
ing ADL items are unlikely to affect our
results unless the obese group experi-
enced changes in bathing and toilet-
ing difficulty not experienced by other
weight groups. Some studies have in-
cluded difficulty walking across a room
as an indicator of ADL limitations.14 If
we include difficulty walking between
rooms on the same floor as an ADL limi-
tation rather than a functional limita-
tion, we observe similar increases in the
effect of obesity on both functional im-
pairment and ADL impairment over
time.
Our results differ somewhat from
some other surveys that have reported
declines in functional impairment for
the elderly population31; this may be
due to differences in interview mode
(NHANES interviews are conducted in
person) or to the particular time
period considered. A recent analysis of
Medicare data found that the total
level of disability was constant from
1992 to 2003, with a decline in Medi-
care beneficiaries with ADL disability
and an increase in beneficiaries with
functional impairment.32 Finally,
screening questions relating to walk-
ing and stair climbing changed slightly
between NHANES III (1988-1994)
and NHANES 1999-2004; however,
results do not change in direction or
significance if we exclude these items.
In general, further research including
more extensive measures of disability,
multiple cohorts, and longer time peri-
ods is warranted.
CONCLUSION
Obese participants in NHANES 1999-
2004 were more likely to report func-
tional impairments than obese partici-

pants in NHANES III (1988-1994),
which suggests an increasing risk of
disability in the obese population.
Furthermore, reductions in ADL dis-
ability observed among nonobese
older individuals did not occur among
obese individuals. Taken together,
these findings suggest that recent
improvements in cardiovascular
health have not been accompanied by
a reduction in disability burden
among obese individuals; instead, the
risk of some types of disability is actu-
ally increasing.
