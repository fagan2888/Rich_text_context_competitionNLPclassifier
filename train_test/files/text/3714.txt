Introduction
In Norway, more than 80% of children who are removed
from their parental homes are placed in foster homes
(Statistics Norway [SSB], 2012). Although kinship place-
ments have become more common in recent years, most of
these children live in non-family foster care for a long time:
It is estimated that approximately 40% of children in foster
care live in foster homes for 4 years or more (Clausen &
Kristofersen, 2008). While there are no reliable statistics
showing how many foster children are returned to their par-
ents annually, children who remain in long-term foster care
are seldom returned to their parents.
Foster care systems and procedures pay little attention to
children's perceptions of the mutual significance of biologi-
cal and foster siblings (Backe-Hansen, Egelund, & Havik,
2010; Lundström & Sallnäs, 2012; Sen & Broadhurst, 2011).
For children living with their parents and siblings, there is a
merging between biological and social relations, which gives
reason to presume that biological ties give a sense of belong-
ing and identity (Midjo, 1998). In cases in which there is no
such merging, the process of acquiring this sense of belong-
ing and identity is less obvious. Studies based on children's
own views about sibling contact and how it affects them are
scarce, despite their obvious value (Herrick & Piccus, 2005).
Based on Norwegian social policy, this article discusses dif-
ferent relations between siblings and elaborates on the sig-
nificance of biological and social ties to siblings for foster
children's sense of belonging.
Up until the 1980s, studies of relations between siblings
were uncommon, and sibling relationships were considered
relatively unimportant from a developmental perspective
(Boer & Dunn, 1992). Family relationships were considered
collectively, as a unit: The family was seen to exert a homo-
geneous influence on all its members. During the last decade,
this traditional view has been challenged (Edwards, Hadfield,
& Mauthner, 2005; Mitchell, 2003), and the significance of
relations among siblings for developing identity and inner
life has been considerably emphasized (Lucey, Mauthner,
Edwaards, & Hadfield, 2005).
There is now research on how sibling relationships
develop throughout life; for example, Victor G. Cicirelli
presents the first comprehensive resource on examining the
course of a sibling relationship, from its beginnings in child-
hood to the end of life, and the factors that influence it. This
work includes a hermeneutic study of the relationships of a
single large family of adult siblings that provides new under-
standings of how adult sibling relationships are maintained
(Cicirelli, 1995). However, we have Rebecca Hagars's
reviews of 17 studies from across several countries, address-
ing definitions and descriptions of sibling groups in care,
characteristics of children placed together or separately, and
outcomes of sibling placements. Most studies examining
outcomes suggest that joint sibling placements are more sta-
ble than placements of single children or separated siblings,

Foster Children's Sense of Sibling
Belonging: The Significance of Biological
and Social Ties
Bjørn Øystein Angel1
Abstract
This article analyzes children's experiences and their perceived sense of belonging to brothers and sisters to assess the
significance of social and biological ties for developing identity. Specifically, this article aims to highlight the significance of
siblings for children moving from homes to foster homes and back to their original homes again. Most children participating
in this study emphasized the continuity of biological relations with their siblings as important for their identity and sense of
belonging. At the same time, social ties to both siblings and foster siblings had significance for their perception of themselves.
A sense of belonging and identity are, thus, shown to develop in relation to both biological siblings and foster siblings.

and that children do well or better when placed with siblings
(Hegar, 2005a). Cicirelli's and Hagars's studies emphasize
the developmental importance siblings have for each other.
A Scottish study explores the ways in which children
understand sibling relationships and how the negotiation of
sibling roles varies according to birth order, age, and gender
(Punch, 2005). This piece of research considers the extent to
which children draw on siblings as a source of support--both
inside and outside the family. The author has since gone on
to investigate the ways in which children consider siblings to
be a source of problems (in the forms of rivalry and conflict)
and how they negotiate outcomes to such tensions (McIntosh
& Punch, 2009).
The experience of new family arrangements is not exclu-
sive to children in foster homes. Children in stepfamilies also
have to deal with new carers' children in some cases. The
existing research on stepfamilies documents a wide range of
children's experiences in adjusting to the presence of steps-
iblings and full brothers and sisters. Many studies have found
that stepchildren can define their family very differently than
do non-stepchildren, as they incorporate new and old rela-
tionships into their new family concept (Berge Fjøsne, 2007;
Bray, 1999; Levin, 1994). By contrast, at least in Norwegian
research concerning foster care, there has been little focus on
existing sibling relationships, despite the fact that the
Ministry of Children, Equality, and Social Inclusion intro-
duced the idea that biological siblings should be placed
together in foster homes as a main principle (The Ministry of
Children, Equality and Social Inclusion [BFD], 1997). This
decision was motivated by the understanding that it would be
in the best interest of the children. Anfinnsen (1998) and
Gjerdevik (2005) examine foster children's understanding of
family, but their discussion of siblings' mutual significance
for one another is very limited. Bunkholdt (2004) discusses
different challenges and dilemmas concerning placing sib-
lings together. Egelund and Hestbæk's (2003) research sur-
vey about the placement of children outside of their homes
points out, among other things, the need for knowledge of
siblings' significance to be reflected in the foster care proce-
dures themselves.
British research is relatively in agreement that it is best to
place siblings together (Berridge & Cleaver, 1987; Thoburn,
1988). However, doing so incurs certain costs and risks
(Rushton, Dance, Quinton, & Mayes, 2001). Sinclair (2005)
effectively sums up newer British research by saying that
sibling relationships are of great importance for both better
and worse. Similarly, Gillian Schofield writes extensively
about the lived experience of children in foster care and their
sense of identity and belonging (Schofield, 2003). Sibling
relations can be harmonious and a source of safety and com-
fort, but they can also be destructive. There is a chronologi-
cal component to this matter as well. At one point, relations
between siblings can foster a sense of belonging and continu-
ity, while at a later point, they may also prove obstacles for
development. Siblings may hold onto old loyalties and
definitions, which, in turn, may bar them from embracing
new possibilities for development afforded by the foster
home environment.
This article's empirical starting point is the interview
material that forms the basis of the research project: Moving
Home After Having Lived in Foster Homes--An Analysis of
Children's Self-Perception and Life Stories (Angel, 2009).
The aim of this article is to explore children's sense of
belonging to siblings and to discuss the significance of bio-
logical and social ties among reunited foster children in the
Norwegian family services model. Whom do the children
perceive to be siblings, and what does this mean for their
identity and sense of belonging? Answers to these questions
will be illuminated by discussing three dimensions of sibling
relations: (a) a mutual sense of belonging and care, (b) an
ambiguous sense of mutuality and care, or (c) no sense of
mutuality and care.
Theory
In this article, the concepts "identity," "social ties," and "bio-
logical ties" are central. Identity is, in this article, based on
Mead's (1913, 1934) perspective, in which the individual's
reflexive interpretation of his or her life story is important.
Identity is socially constructed, and people can reflect on the
social world and their position therein (Jenkins, 2008), simi-
lar to the notion of "the social self" (Mead, 1934), which
asserts that the self is inseparably attached to society.
According to Mead, the self is constructed by two parts: I
and Me. Me can be called the Self's social role or expectation,
while I is the spontaneous, creative and acting component.
The tension between Me and I leads people to consciously
analyze themselves. Me is social and represents knowledge
of others' behavioral expectations. In essence, per this view,
the self is socially constructed, as it is influenced and devel-
oped through interaction with other people (Charon & Cahill,
2004; Mead, 1934). Identity is continually created and sus-
tained. To have a sense of who we are, we must have a notion
of where we come from and how we have become what we
are (Mead, 1934). Herrick and Piccus (2005) argue that sib-
ling connections are extremely important to children in out-
of-home care; children need to know their identity and
belonging.
Biological ties are more desirable than social ties. Social
ties are acquired through interaction with other people.
Biological ties are given social and cultural content, though
biological ties are seen as fixed as they are ascribed at birth
to children (Schneider, 1984). The various types of families
can make it necessary to redefine the sense of family belong-
ing to include family ties acquired and based on social ties,
independent of biological origin (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim,
2002). According to Levin (1994), emotions and intimacy
have become more important than ties of kinship and law as
foundations for a sense of belonging. Every member of the
family can have his or her own perception of who belongs to
Angel 3
the family. Familial belonging is no longer limited in the
ways it once was. Identity and sense of belonging are contex-
tual and relational entities (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim, 2002).
Children in foster homes can establish their identity and
sense of belonging both in relation to their biological and
foster families, together with biological and social ties
(Ostler, 2013).
"Belonging" describes a sense of "belonging to" or
"belonging with" someone. "A sense of belonging" can be
understood as an experience of equality and intimacy, and
thus, it is closely linked to "social identity." The concept is
often used to indicate belonging to place(s) (e.g., home/fos-
ter home), nationality, or culture (Giuliani, 2003). Individuals
can, to a certain extent, choose to whom or what they may
want to belong. The different relationships people enter can
likewise be significant to their sense of belonging (Midjo,
1997). Sense of belonging is developed in different contexts.
This situational sense of belonging gives the individual
opportunity to enter changing phases of belonging and asso-
ciated processes. Different forms of belonging may include
both biological and social ties. Foster children who have
moved homes, for example, may have a sense of belonging
to their biological siblings, to their foster siblings, and to
other children.
"Sense of belonging" refers to the experience of commu-
nity and social integration, while "identity" emphasizes indi-
viduality (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Both concepts
thematize how people find a place in society (Jenkins, 2008).
Identity consists of both expressing what is unique for the
individual and, at the same time, showing a sense of belong-
ing to a larger social context (Mead, 1913, 1934). Identity
refers to how we understand and present ourselves and to
how we understand and pass on a sense of belonging. In the
same way, foster children's sense of belonging to siblings is
part of the foundation of their identity.
Method
Participants and Data Collection
The children participating in this study each experienced the
intervention of child welfare services, placement in a foster
home, and a subsequent return to their original home at a
later date. The sample comprises 10 children, 3 boys and 7
girls, who were taken into custody when they were between
the ages of 4 and 12 years old. The children lived outside
their homes for periods ranging from 2½ to 12 years. On
average, the children lived more than 5 years in the foster
home. At the time of the interview, the youngest had just
turned 11, while the oldest was 17.All the children lived with
foster siblings: 8 children had biological siblings placed in
foster care, 5 children had biological siblings remaining with
the birth family, and 3 children had biological siblings born
into their birth family after entering care. There were 3 sib-
ling groups in the sample. In total, these 10 children had 34
full and half brothers and sisters. During the children's time
in foster homes, they established contact with a total of 28
foster siblings.
The chief reasons for the children's placement in foster
homes related to their parents' inability to care for them
(owing primarily to addictions and mental health problems).
The county social welfare boards decided that each of the
children should be taken into care and placed in a foster
home. Subsequently, these boards prescribed the return of
these children to their parents. The children had been moved
from their homes against their wishes and those of their par-
ents, and they had moved back home again according to their
own and their parents' wishes.
A half-structured interview guide was used to investigate
the research question: What is the significance of social and
biological ties to foster children's sense of belonging and
identity? The guide contained topics I wished to illuminate,
formulated as descriptive questions. The interviews were
carried out in the children's homes with one exception,
which was conducted in the corner of a café according to the
child's wishes. All the interviews were recorded and then
transcribed.
A study requires the free and informed consent of its
informants (Hill, 2005; National Committee for Research
Ethics in the Social Sciences and the Humanities [NESH],
2006). Ethical matters were considered in the recruitment of
participants, as outlined byAlderson (2005), Morrow (2005),
and Punch (2002), particularly concerning children's free-
dom to consent and confidentiality. The project was approved
by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD;
2000). I contacted the children through the Department of
Children, Youth, and Family Affairs' foster home services in
six counties (108 municipalities total), in addition to directly
contacting the child protection services in 14 of these munic-
ipalities. These services sent out the invitation, which also
described the nature of the project, to parents whose children
had been returned to them from foster care. My address and
phone number were included, in addition to a consent form
with a stamped return envelope, which parents and children
could send me if they wanted to participate in the study. The
children expressed interest at the letter stage in participating.
At our first meeting, I offered the children further opportuni-
ties for information exchange and gained their signed con-
sent to participate. Fluid consent (the freedom to withdraw
from the study at any time) was assured during the interview.
To protect the anonymity of participants throughout the text,
I have excluded the children's names or other identifiable
characteristics.
Data Analysis
The interviews, which are analyzed as life stories (Hatch &
Wisniewski, 1995), thus have a hermeneutic interpretive char-
acter (Ricoeur, 1974; Vattimo, 1997). The material is summa-
rized, so that the meaning of the text is concentrated, and the
4 SAGE Open
original text is shortened (Silverman, 2011). The children's
life stories are analyzed to reveal their most important themes.
The analysis of qualitative data involves posing questions to
the material, as well as organizing the answers in a systematic
and relevant way (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994). The analysis has
four developmental stages: (a) forming a general impression,
(b) identifying the significant units, (c) abstracting the con-
tents of the different significant units, and (d) extracting the
most important elements (Miles & Huberman, 1994).
This is a grounded theory approach analyzing informants'
stories and perspectives. The transcribed material is divided
into categories that made sense when they were taken out of
context, and which emerged inductively during analysis. The
children each describe their life stories in relation to their
siblings and foster siblings with different distance, symme-
try, and depth. In the material, we can see two different
dimensions. One dimension, called mutuality, includes striv-
ing for balance. This dimension may include mutuality in
emotions, such as liking or not liking one another; in influ-
ence, which is decided upon by both sides; and in content,
that is, having the same interests, which concerns what James
(1993) calls "to be friends with." The other dimension can be
called care. This dimension ranges from giving to receiving
care. Here, one party in the relationship is dependent on the
other. In such relational patterns, what one does together
with others is important to create a background of common
experience. Based on mutuality and care, the analysis will
thus concentrate on isolating three dimensions: a mutual
sense of belonging and care, an ambiguous sense of mutual-
ity and care, or no sense of mutuality and care. We find chil-
dren who clearly and distinctly fit into the above-identified
categories, while there are others who are less easily classi-
fied, but who still fit a category type.
Three Dimensions of Mutuality and Care
In a family with more than one child, there are usually three
sets of relations: the relationship between the spouses, the
relationships between parents and children, and the relation-
ships among the siblings (Jensen, Moen, & Clausen, 1991).
Sibling relationships are different from the other types in that
they generally last the longest; we often have siblings our
whole lives. This is not necessarily true in the case of foster
siblings. Who foster children consider to be their siblings
depends on various circumstances, such as social ties, living
in the same home, intimacy, and meeting regularly. To under-
stand a child's relationship with brothers and sisters, it is
therefore necessary to think beyond biology and include the
child's experiences (Rushton et al., 2001).
During the time the study participants spent at their origi-
nal homes, during their time in foster care, and again during
the time after their return home, all were involved in different
social and communicative processes that contributed to the
development of their respective siblings-orientation. When a
child is placed in a foster home, it is generally foster family
members who become that child's daily interaction partners,
while interactions with biological parents and siblings in that
home environment become more (or entirely) limited.
In my conversations with study participants, I asked with
whom they lived and asked them to tell me about themselves
without defining what was implied. As the children's views
on and evaluations of biological siblings and foster siblings
are complex, it is not possible to evaluate too precisely
whether or not they "liked" their siblings, or whether or not
their siblings "meant something" to them. To categorize on a
sympathy­antipathy scale would be to use a "still photo" as
a starting point, which would give a distorted view of ever-
changing relations. For example, one of the children
explained that she wanted to move into her first foster home
because the foster parents' own daughter was at her same
age. They played well together when she stayed only at
weekends and before she moved in "for real." As time went
by, this child's perception of her relationship with her foster
sister changed and became more ambivalent.
Normally, children who are born to the same parents and
live together do not problematize whether they are siblings
or not. Such a relationship is normally taken for granted and
woven into our imagined worlds (Smart & Silva, 1999).
What has significance for whether social relations become
useful social resources for children has more to do with
mutual obligations, expectations, and credibility. Children
can do things for other children, whereby trust relations are
formed that, in turn, generate expectations and obligations.
This type of belonging depends on two factors: On the one
hand, credibility to the social surroundings, which means
that one keeps one's promises; and on the other hand, the
actual scale of the obligations one has.
A Mutual Sense of Belonging and Care
This subgroup includes children who identify with and count
as brothers and sisters: (a) their biological siblings who lived
at home when they were in foster homes themselves, and/or
(b) their foster siblings. One of the children said this about
her biological siblings:
My older sister lived with mummy all the time, and then mummy
had my younger sister. It was strange that they lived at home
while Gro and I lived in a foster home. When we were at home
with mummy, we did a lot of girl stuff . . . We have always
been a family. It is here I belong.
Interviewer: What do you think about your older and your
younger sister?
Child: I love them, and they love me. I know that.
Another child said this about his foster sister:
The [the foster parents'] daughter and I had a really good
relationship, and she lives in X-city and I really like to visit her.
Angel 5
I meet her now and then, send mail and call, and . . . She is 6
years older than me . . . She is that kind of a sister to me, and
she has a boy and a girl that I am kind of an uncle to. I notice that
they like me, and I like them, too. We belong to each other.
In his story about himself and his foster siblings, this par-
ticipant conceives of himself as an acting, experiencing, and
analyzing subject. His analyses are complex, as he takes into
account others' perspectives, while analyzing his own con-
siderations of himself. He reflects critically over his own
way of being, and he has clear perceptions of the social con-
sequences of what he said and did during the time he lived in
the foster home. Mead's identity theory (1934) includes a
high degree of choice, as identity is based on one's reflexive
interpretations with one's biography as a starting point. In
this same vein, this boy now calls his foster siblings "his"
siblings. They have influenced his identity and his under-
standing and experience of belonging.
In the following, first, a biological older sister speaks
about her biological younger sister, and then this younger
sister tells us about her relationship with her older sister:
And I have promised to come and tell it to her class, as she
thinks it is so embarrassing talking about it (that she has lived in
a foster home). She says it is embarrassing, but I think she is
scared of telling, that it is a bit scary . . . she says that it is
embarrassing . . . I care for her, and we are connected to each
other.
The younger sister talks of telling others how it was for
her older sister to be in the foster home.
And then she asked almost every day if I wanted to join her and
play with dolls, for she was so alone. She loves me.
These biological sisters, who are only about a year apart
in age, had always been together, and they talked about
mutual care for each other from early on. The quotes also
point out the mutuality the sisters felt. When they talked
about important events in the interviews, they used the "we"-
form: "we endured" and "we managed" and "we stuck
together." Both girls talked about each other with joy--
simultaneously as they expressed joy and respect for an older
biological sister who had lived at home all the time. This
relationship between these sisters was confirmed and
strengthened by the time they had together, and their com-
mon history and biography strengthened their identity. Their
relations evidence balance or mutuality, according to the lan-
guage adopted in this study. This may include the idea that
care is shown mutually, and balance is created through both
parties presenting themselves as intentional, as shown in the
excerpts.
In the transcribed interviews, there are also examples of
the other dimension, care. The children both looked after and
cared for each other in different ways. We saw one variant of
this in the example above, a testimony to the girls' mutual
relationship. The care between them was characterized by a
deep, symmetrical intimacy. They alternated between giving
and receiving care, depending on who needed it. They were
there for each other freely without letting it put limitations on
their lives.
The children who participated in interviews in this study
can be said to have known a "risk situation," as children who
enter into custody in our society often show signs of diffi-
culty. In many risk situations, feeling useful, taking responsi-
bility, and experiencing control can be factors that contribute
to increased competence and the formation of a positive
identity (Grøholt, Sommerschild, & Gjærum, 1998). In this
light, the children's experience of caring may strengthen the
relations and sense of belonging among them.
There are also examples in the transcripts of how care
took the form of one of the siblings distinctly going in and
taking responsibility for the other without it being clear that
the other should give anything in return (as we saw in the
previous excerpt). Another informant provided an example
of how such a relationship can turn out:
I came to the other family [her second foster home] before him.
I said that I wanted my brother up there, rather than having him
stay with them [the old foster home]. Then he also moved.
This excerpt says much about caring for a younger bio-
logical brother and taking responsibility. This subject took
responsibility in their changing situations--in her first foster
home and in transitioning to a new foster home--by ensuring
that her brother stayed with her. In the conversations with her
brother, when we touched upon the issue of moving, he said,
"She is the one who fixes things." The texts contain a num-
ber of themes mentioned by both subjects: visiting with one
another when apart, taking responsibility, adjusting, and
trusting one another.Another informant, who is also included
in this dimension, expresses these notions explicitly when
she talks about her biological sister:
She looks up to me so much, only talks about me, like all the
time. I know that if I had died, she would never have made it . . .
She is so attached to me.
The sister responds,
. . . when she sees that I need something, she helps me. She cares
for me.
Hence, this second pattern can be described as asymmetric,
in which one of the sisters does tasks that are usually associ-
ated with parenthood in our culture. If the act of taking care of
another disturbs one's own functioning, this could be a form of
the practice that specialists of different disciplines and with
differenttheoreticalstandingscall"parentification"(Haugland,
2006). Normally, the term parentification is used in situations
when children enter adult roles in relation to their own parents,
but it could also include situations when children fulfill clear
6 SAGE Open
adult roles in relation to other family members. In my mate-
rial, it is children who perform actions or "practices" in which
one occupies a care-receiving position and the other a respon-
sible care-giving position in continual care relations. In the
type just discussed, there is dominance in the relationship, and
one has influence on the other; simultaneously, there can be
mutuality in interest. Parentification can be incompatible with
the establishment of a healthy feeling of intrinsic value and
may prevent positive self-development (Haugland, 2006).
Ambiguous Mutuality and Care
These children were uncertain whether to name their foster
siblings among their "siblings." Here, we also find children
who are uncertain of whether their biological siblings--who
were born while they lived in foster homes themselves--
were their real siblings. An informant told me about his bio-
logical sister who was born while he lived in a foster home:
She [the subject's younger sister] said that it was strange that I
came there [home]. It was Me and Me. I was a bit difficult during
that period when I came home. I think that I kind of have not got
so much attention from my mother, as I have been away so much.
And when she [the sister] also demanded attention, I wasn't very
happy with that . . . don't really know if she really is my sister.
The sense of belonging within a group of children that
fosters intimacy depends on both the physical presence of the
children and the amount of attention they give each other.
Even though children may be physically there for each other,
there is a shortage of intimacy between the children if no
strong bond exists between them. One of the children
expressed her feelings for her sister as follows:
In a way we do not fit together. But at the same time, we belong
together. I don't know what to say.
Kinship ties are no longer necessarily biological. As these
ties are no longer taken for granted, they undergo negotiation;
by contrast, in previous times, basic trust was taken for granted
in family relations. The relation builds on what the partners
obtain in their relationship with each other, more than building
on forced commitment. Here, it is mutuality and intimacy that
count--both of which are missing in the excerpt above.
No Mutuality and Care
The third subgroup embraces two subcategories. The first
subcategory is made up of respondents who do not consider
their foster siblings as siblings. One of the children in my
study expressed it like this:
Their kids, they got a key when they were going home after
school, but I waited a couple of hours now and then, to get home
and such. That really sucked. We did not care for each other . . . .
Note the child called his foster siblings "their kids." He
also used the term the other non-foster-children. This was his
description of his foster siblings from his first foster home.
Concerning the foster siblings in his other foster home, he
barely mentioned that the foster parents had some grown-up
children. He related to me,
I have never been . . . familiar with them [the foster siblings],
they . . . kept . . . to themselves. I can't say that they are my
siblings. Not what I put into it.
Interviewer: When are people siblings of each other then?
The child: It is when you have the same parents and have grown
up together, and we care about each other.
In sum, this participant does not consider his foster fami-
ly's children as his siblings with significance for his sense of
belonging and identity. Another child in my study said,
I felt that the foster parents' children looked down on me. I
didn't like them either.
When one of the children recounted her life story, she
mentioned that her foster parents had a daughter after she
had been there for 4 years, and then a son 3 years later. In
conversation, we touched upon the contact she had with her
previous foster home:
Interviewer: Do you have any contact with your previous
foster home today?
Child: Yes.
Interviewer: Tell me a little bit about this contact.
Child: It is like going to people you know from before.
But it gets weirder when you go there, and then the
little kids are there.
Interviewer: What do you think about the little kids over
there, then?
Child: They are much nicer now; they are not so annoying
any more. They do not cling onto you all the time. My
previous foster parents tell me that they talk about me,
like, all the time.
Interviewer: I can imagine that. Do you think they see you
as their sibling?
Child: I don't know.
Interviewer: Do you think of them as your siblings?
Child: No, not at all. We do not have the same parents and
we have not grown up together. There is nothing that
ties us together.
Thus, in her reflections on her foster home, she did not
consider herself as sister to these children because she was
not related to them. Nonetheless, she did not reject the pos-
sibility that her previous foster siblings might view her as
their older sister.

The other subcategory covers those who do not consider
their biological siblings as siblings. One informant describes
and analyzes her relationship with her biological brother as if
there is distance between them:
And then he decided to become a Christian once. And now he
goes around and testifies, and that is okay. We never figured it
out with each other, we are so different. In fact, I do not think of
him as my brother, just that we are so different.
In her elaboration, she said that there had always been a
certain distance between her and her biological brother.
When she lived in the foster home, they lived there together,
but they never had a very close relationship with each other.
To a query about understanding her relationship with her
brother, she says in response that she has never thought much
about him, even when young. He found his place in the foster
home, while she longed to get back home to her mother.
According to the informant, the foster home favored her
brother. She thinks that the difference in treatment that took
place in the foster home contributed to maintaining the dis-
tance or at least prevented them from becoming closer to
each other. After she moved back home, things did not
improve; rather the opposite occurred. She presumed that
there was a sense of mutuality in how her biological brother
would describe the relationship between them.
This section has shown three dimensions of mutuality and
care as reflected in the informants' life stories. In the next
section, I summarize and conclude the article's key points.
Discussion and Summary
The starting point of this study is children's understandings
of their own situation, as well as the significance of social
and biological ties to the development of a sense of belong-
ing and identity. Responding to calls from scholars such as
Herrick and Piccus (2005), among others, this study attempts
to address the lack of research examining children's under-
standing of themselves--in this case, specifically regarding
sibling relations and their significance to children.
This article has focused on a particular aspect of sibling
relations: an exploration of the significance of biological and
social ties among reunited foster children and what can be
described as the creation of sibling relationships. All children
need a sense of belonging and identity, a sense which is derived
according to both biological and social ties. This is also true
for children who have lived in foster homes, though such chil-
dren may have more complex patterns of biological and social
ties owing to their experiences in different home environ-
ments. The authority of the child welfare system can have the
effect of giving sibling relations a high degree of intensity and
density, but diversity and distance may also result.
The study shows that foster children may have biological
siblings with whom they live in the same foster home, who
are in different foster homes or with whom they live after
they have moved back home again. Furthermore, the study
shows that more foster children from different families may
live in the same foster home, and the foster family may have
their own biological children. The children participating in
the study revealed different types of relations to their bio-
logical and foster siblings. One group experienced a mutual
sense of belonging and care, another group experienced
ambivalent mutuality and care, and a third group experienced
no mutuality and care at all. Because children are active
agents in their own lives (Angel, 2010), they use the signifi-
cance of their relationships with biological and foster sib-
lings to negotiate their understandings of themselves. In this
context, siblings'reciprocal relation to each other establishes
a sense of belonging and care. In turn, belonging and care are
ambivalent or absent when children define their relational
experiences in other ways.
The majority of the children in this study feel a sense of
belonging to their biological family. To have a comprehen-
sible identity and a consistent biography, these children
chose to distance themselves from their foster siblings. Those
who were placed in foster homes together chose each other,
while those who were placed alone chose siblings who lived
with their mother. There were also children who were closely
attached to their foster siblings and to their foster families as
if these ties would last. There were even children who did not
claim any relation to their biological siblings and did not
experience any sense of belonging to them. Clearly, both bio-
logical and foster siblings can be important for a child's
development, identity, and sense of belonging. The strict
definition of "sibling" can vary according to a child's experi-
ence. My summarizing conclusion is that, for the children in
the study, biological siblings are the most important sibling
relation. At the same time, the study shows that, for some
children, the sibling relation to other children is more impor-
tant than the relation to the biological siblings. There is noth-
ing in the children's lives that immediately and objectively
indicates which sibling relation is most meaningful to them;
this can only be understood through conversations with each
individual child.
The majority of the children in the study tended to display
an either­or sense of belonging vis-à-vis their siblings.
Sibling relationships vary according to whom they live with
and how they perceive their social interactions, echoing
Mead's theory of the social self (Mead, 1934). Biological
and social ties which can be re-created and maintained
socially become significant for sibling relations. For some
children in the study, relations to other children could be
characterized as "pure relations" (Giddens, 1992), in which
the children choose which relations they call siblings. For
some children in the study, social relations have precedence,
while for others, biological ties are more significant.
According to Mead's theory, to have a sense of who we are,
we must have a notion of where we come from and how we
have become who we are (Mead, 1934). This is the case for
the children in my study.

Changes in environment, caregivers, and siblings show
that children's positions in relation to each other are not
"static." This observation agrees with the changing positions
that Mauthner (2002) describes in his research on sistering,
wherein role reversals take place between the "big sister"
role of caregiver and "little sister" position of receiving care.
Changes in sibling status may reflect strategic interaction, as
McIntosh and Punch (2009) have noted.
The study shows that sibling relations play a significant
role in children's developmental situations, particularly
regarding how they take responsibility for and care for each
other, and how they perceive and understand themselves.
Having to move back and forth between parents' homes and
foster homes precipitates a perceptual shift in which the
affected children can no longer take common family rela-
tionships for granted, and in turn become more conscious
about themselves and their siblings. We have also seen that
some foster children attach themselves to foster siblings in a
positive way, and that this relation significantly affects their
self-perception. Others, however, maintain distance from
their foster siblings to clearly establish that they belong to
another family. The study by Cicirelli (1995), as well as
newer studies by Hegar (2005a) and Lucey et al. (2005), con-
firms these findings about the construction of meaning in
sibling relationships. Hegar (2005b) further shows that sib-
ling placements are more stable than situations where chil-
dren are placed separately. Although my study did not
specifically focus on this distinction, it does show how
important the biological sibling relationship may be for
children.
To have continuity in one's own story--and to be able to
interpret this story--is important for everyone. This identity
depends on the biography as the individual reflexively under-
stands it (Mead, 1934). The stories and perceptions revealed
by the children in my study confirm this theory. Another
finding from the interviews was that most children do not
talk much about their foster siblings and their relations with
them in positive terms. Furthermore, the study shows that the
foster children negotiate the siblings' roles in relation to sib-
lings who live back home, siblings who are born while they
themselves live in foster homes, and the foster parents' own
children. This builds on Punch's (2005) finding that siblings'
roles vary in relation to the children's gender, age, and posi-
tion in the sibling group. Caring about biological siblings,
rivalry and conflict with biological siblings, or having to
compare oneself with the foster parents' own children
strengthens the children's perception of themselves and their
identity, and a sense of belonging becomes a central feature.
Similarly, in line with McIntosh and Punch's (2009) finding
that children may view their siblings as a source of rivalry
and conflicts, the children in my study define their sibling
relations from biology, relations, intimacy, and whether or
not they have cohabitated. These findings confirm and build
upon findings from prior research on siblings and stepfami-
lies (Berge Fjøsne, 2007; Bray, 1999; Cicirelli, 1995;
Edwards et al., 2005; Hegar, 2005a; Levin, 1994; Mitchell,
2003).
These findings highlight a number of challenges in plac-
ing siblings in the same foster home. Many child welfare
services in Norway are experiencing a growing housing cri-
sis, as they struggle to place children in a time of financial
retrenchment, staff turnover, and other procedural difficul-
ties. Similar challenges have been reported both in the
United States (Schorr, 2000) and Great Britain (Randall,
Cowley, & Tomlinson, 2000). Despite these trying circum-
stances, expectations dictate that siblings should be placed
together. Many foster children had siblings, or half-siblings
who may not have shared a home, prior to their removal by
the social welfare services. The diverse situations of chil-
dren in the public child welfare system make it very chal-
lenging to place children with their siblings (Hegar, 2005b).
They often come into care at different times, and sometimes
social welfare services may not have a complete picture of
the children's relationships. Members of several sibling
groups have individual needs that may require different
levels of care. Some are part of large sibling groups with
wide age spans, which poses a challenge to placing them all
in a single home. Despite these challenges, it is encourag-
ing that sibling placements have become a priority for child
welfare services in Norway.
Some of the limitations of the present study include the
self-recruitment of the informants and their relatively small
number. Furthermore, the age range of informants is rela-
tively large. Although it is widely understood that siblings
will fare the best by being placed together, lack of foster
homes can lead to placement in separate homes. Despite this,
my findings have several practical implications. Child wel-
fare services should acknowledge the importance of getting
to know each individual child and his or her sibling
relationship(s), of learning what they represent for each
child, and of considering each child's point of view.
Children's relationships with siblings must be addressed,
both before and during the process of choosing foster homes.
Furthermore, this perspective must be maintained through-
out the entire foster care period. Children's relationships
with siblings--biological as well as foster siblings--seem to
be important to them. While we still do not know enough
about the significance of contact with siblings during stays in
foster homes, my study shows that children develop their
identity and sense of belonging through ties with both bio-
logical siblings and foster siblings.
