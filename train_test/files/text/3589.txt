Introduction
Providing care to a sick family member is a tradition embed-
ded in African culture. It is regarded as an age-old act of
kindness, love and loyalty, which bind family members
together (Asuquo, Adejumo, Etowa, & Adejumo, 2013;
Smith & Segal, 2013). With sub-Saharan Africa accounting
for 69% of people living with HIV, coupled with advance-
ment in medical treatment and improvement in life expec-
tancy, many more persons will assume caregiving role of
people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA; Singh, Chaudoir,
Escobar, & Kalichman, 2011; UNAIDS, 2012). Studies have
shown that most HIV infected individuals return to their
homes for care and psychological support (Bachmanna &
Booysenb, 2006; Global Coalition on Women and AIDS,
2004; Grunfeld et al., 2004; Kipp, Nkosi, Laing, & Jhangri,
2006; VSO, 2006; WHO, 2005). According to Takamura and
Williams (1998) in our society, family caregivers often go
unnoticed except by those who depend on their care.
Similarly, Abasiubong, Bassey, Ogunsemi, and Udobang
(2011) asserted that while resolute efforts are made to
improve the quality of life of PLWHA in many countries,
little or no acknowledgment is given to the supportive role of
caregivers or the effect the role is having on them. Habid and
Rahman (2010) reported that family caregivers are physi-
cally, psychologically and socially disabled due to caring for
PLWHA.
Health systems in most developing countries do not have
the capacity to provide long-term care and support to
PLWHA, and patients are discharged without contact with
family caregivers (Tshililo & Davhana-Maselesele, 2009).
Patient discharge is based on the implicit assumption that,
family members are always available to provide care at home
to the dependent ill, without adequate educational prepara-
tion of family members on their expected roles (VSO, 2006).
Reinhard, Given, Petlick, and Bemis (2008) observed that a
serious health care gap exists as health professionals' fail to
recognize caregivers as "hidden" patients even with numer-
ous research evidence on adverse physical and mental health

Assessing Women Caregiving Role to
People Living With HIV/AIDS in Nigeria,
West Africa
Ekaete Francis Asuquo1, Josephine B. Etowa2,
and Margaret I. Akpan1
Abstract
HIV/AIDS scourge remains high in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa such as Nigeria, which is home to about 3.3 million
HIV positive individuals and represents the second largest burden of HIV/AIDS care, treatment and demand worldwide after
South Africa. Anti-retroviral treatment options though a welcome development, has increased the number of people living
with this chronic illness, and most of them depend on family members for physical and emotional support. Traditional gender
norms in Nigeria ensure that legitimately, women and girls are the first options for caregiving roles. This mandatory role
has in turn imposed psychosocial disruption in the lives of female family members in Calabar, Nigeria. This descriptive study
utilized convenient sampling technique, Zarit Burden Interview scale and semistructured questionnaires for data collection
(260 respondents), and data analyses were achieved using SPSS16.0. The study showed that a significant (p < .05) proportion
of women (91%) were involved in providing care, including children from 10 years and above. Caregivers had minimal social
support which increased the burden they experienced. The need for policy that recognizes and supports female caregivers
("silent cornerstone") to reduce burden and ensure high quality care of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Nigeria is
advocated.

consequences from physically and emotionally demanding
work of caregiving. The physical tasks performed by the
caregivers transcend minor to complex tasks, which is simi-
lar to those carried out by paid health or social service pro-
viders. These impart a great degree of burden on the
caregivers especially, as they combine the caregiving ser-
vices with their official roles in the society. Caregiving has
increased the burden of care on many households particu-
larly the females, by worsening their economic status and
subjecting them to imminent poverty. The need for heal
thcare system and government to promulgate policies that
will support female caregivers and also enhance quality of
care to PLWHA in Nigeria becomes imperative. This study
therefore highlights the extent of burden experienced by
female caregivers compared to male counterparts and the
support available to all caregivers of PLWHA in Calabar
Municipality, Nigeria.
Women and Burden of Care
Women constitute about 50% of the people living with HIV
today worldwide (WHO, 2013). In 2007, the prevalence of
HIV infection had been on men than women (UNAIDS,
2008), but with the turn of events women now bear the bur-
den of this devastating disease more than men (WHO/
UNICEF/ UNFPA/World Bank, 2010). In sub-Saharan
Africa, women constitute 60% of people living with HIV and
the proportion of women living with HIV has been increas-
ing in the last 10 years (WHO, 2013). These figures vindicate
the words of Lewis (2005) that HIV/AIDS in Africa has a
"female face." Apart from biological vulnerability of women
to HIV, the African traditional gender norms stipulate care-
giving as female normative role where women and girls in
the various communities become caregivers, while still need-
ing care themselves, and possibly being HIV positive also
(UNAIDS, 2008; UNIFEM, 2005; VSO, 2006). These "tra-
ditional gender norms" also exclude men and boys becoming
caregivers, exacerbating the burden for females. Many
women and girls have left work and school to provide care,
and most have taken on this role in addition to their existing
reproductive and primary roles as housewives/housekeepers
(VSO, 2006).
Encouraging care provision in homes is regarded as a
cost-effective strategy for governments and the private sec-
tor, but little consideration is given to the physical, emotional
and economic costs to households and the caregivers who
take on the additional burdens, many of whom are often poor
and living below US$ 1.00 to US$1.25 per day (Asuquo,
Etowa, & Adejumo, 2013; United Nations, 2012; United
Nations Development Progress, 2013). Mbirimtengerenji
(2007) asserted that not only does correlation exist between
poverty and HIV infection but HIV remained the exact out-
come of poverty in the sub-Saharan region with sexual trade,
migration, polygamy, and teenage marriages as its predic-
tors.According to VSO-RAISA(2007) and UNAIDS (2008),
the impact of HIV and burden of care is greater in resource-
poor settings, particularly for rural and grass-root caregivers.
UNAIDS (2008) reported that women in Africa make up
70% of the world's poor and two thirds of the world's illiter-
ate and accounts for two thirds of all caregivers for people
living with HIV in Africa. The unique contribution in ame-
liorating the impact of HIV is not only peculiar to African
women alone. Global Coalition on Women and AIDS (2004)
asserted that about 90% of the care due to HIV infection is
provided at home by women and girls in addition to other
tasks they already perform. Arno (2002) and Family Care
Alliance (2003) have also reported that women caregiving
provides the backbone of support to the complex system of
long-term care and the value of the informal care that women
provide ranges from US$148 billion to US$188 billion annu-
ally. Although annual monetary value of unpaid caregiving
in Nigeria has not yet been quantified, the global estimated
value of unremunerated work by women is 11 trillion dollars
(UNAIDS, 2008).
Forever Young Information (FYI, 2013) affirmed that
females assume caregiving role at a young age and take an
active interest in their love one's health and maintain this
role as they grow older. Between the ages of 30 and 55 years,
women become primary caregivers in Ontario households
and assume the responsibility of health care decisions for
their children, siblings, spouses and parents (FYI, 2013).
Canadian Caregiver Coalition (2013) noted that about 4 to 5
million people serve as caregivers with the majority being
women and they provide more than 80% of the care needed
by HIV individuals. These "long-term" conditions and con-
stitute more than US$5 billion of unpaid labor annually to
the health care system. Hence, family caregivers (women)
are the invisible backbone of the health and long-term care
system which signify need for support to reduce negative
consequences on their health.
Caregiving and Support
Caregiving in the Nigerian society though associated with
some rewarding experiences, is laden with chronic life
strains from excessive job responsibilities. Caregivers
attempt to balance caregiving with their other activities such
as work, family and leisure, to meet the demands of daily
living. Inability to strike a balance results in experiences of
negative reactions such as increased sense of burden
(Argimon, Limon, Vila, & Cabezas, 2004; Pavalko &
Woodbury, 2000; Stephens, Townsend, Martire, & Druley,
2001). According to Reinhard et al. (2008) both negative and
positive consequences of providing care may exist simulta-
neously. The negatives consequences emanate from exces-
sive life stressors which require daily readjustments, which if
not may result in interference with performance of role-
related activities (Thoits, 1986). Excessive caregiving stress
could result in physical, social and emotional consequences
which manifest as low perception of health status, perceived
Asuquo et al. 3
high stress levels, deep unhappiness, social anxiety, depres-
sion and induced changes that could degenerate to heart dis-
ease, hypertension, increase rate of physiological illness and
suppressed immune responses (Abasiubong et al., 2011;
ANON, 2009; Kipp et al., 2006; Kurtz, Kurtz, Given, &
Given, 2005; Montgomery, Rowe, & Kosloski, 2007;
National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) & AARP, 2009;
Zarit, 2004).
The need to support caregivers' well-being and that of
care recipient becomes imperative especially with the advent
of antiretroviral therapy. Supporting caregivers' entails pro-
viding coping assistance, or involving significant others in
an individual's stress-management efforts (Hornillos &
Crespo, 2011; Thoits, 1986). Turner and Street (1999)
asserted that support could be through instrumental aid
(actions or materials provided to ensure attainment of role
responsibilities), socioemotional aid (infer the assertions or
demonstrations of love, caring, esteem, sympathy, and group
belonging), and informational aid (communications of infor-
mation that makes life challenges easier). These three mea-
sures will help the caregiver to change the situation, meaning
attached to the situation, emotional reaction to the situation,
or to change all three thereby reducing the perceived burden
(Thoits, 1986). Thoits added that social support buffers the
detrimental effects of caregiving stress.
Female caregivers of PLWHA who combine caregiving
with their reproductive and productive activities, need sup-
port for continual adaptation to task changes and to reduce
the burden of care on them and enhance quality care to the
care recipient. The conceptualization of support as coping
strategy or the active involvement of significant others in the
caregivers' ability to manage stress is the principal theme
that is exemplified in this study.
In this regard, the level of burden experienced by all care-
givers of PLWHA was examined to (a) compare the degree
of perceived burden of caregiving work experienced by
female and male caregivers, (b) assess the duration of care by
both male and female caregivers, (c) assess the availability
of support to caregivers, and (c) the willingness of caregivers
to continue caregiving in the future.
Materials and Method
Location of the Study
The study was carried out in Calabar Municipality, Cross
River State of Nigeria from June to December 2009. In
Calabar, there exist the University of Calabar Teaching
Hospital (UCTH; a tertiary institution) which is a referral
center to primary and secondary health care facilities in the
region. It also provides inpatient and outpatient services as
well as collaborates with nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) in the treatment of PLWHA from rural/urban areas
and neighboring country. The hospital has been selected by
the Federal Government of Nigeria as one of the centers for
the management of PLWHA. The study was informed by the
high HIV prevalence of 10.4% at the study site (Asuquo,
Etowa, & Adejumo, 2013; Federal Ministry of Health
[FMOH], 2011).
Study Design and Participants
The study was a cross-sectional descriptive research which
utilized convenient sampling technique to generate data from
260 participants who were primary caregivers to PLWHA.
The study participants were identified through HIV clinic of
the UCTH where some of the researchers worked as employ-
ees (Clinical Instructors) and the visitation list of a voluntary
caregiver of PLWHA, an NGO (Positive Development
Foundation, Calabar, Nigeria). Information letter and invita-
tion for willing participants were posted at UCTH and the
NGO office where willing participants contacted the
researcher. The participants who met the inclusion criteria
and were willing to participate in the study were contacted.
As described previously (Asuquo, Etowa, & Adejumo,
2013), the inclusion criteria were: being a caregiver for more
than one month and also caring for PLWHA patient with
some functional abilities as a family member. The age of
caregiver's cuts across all age brackets, which include chil-
dren under the age of 16 (Becker, 2007; Robson, Ansell,
Huber, Gould, & Van Blerk, 2006), especially in sub-Saha-
ran with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. There were 299
potential caregivers, who met the inclusion criteria of being
primary caregivers, but only 260 completely filled their
questionnaires and 11 caregivers did not know the diagnosis
or ailment of their care receivers. Twelve (12) refused to par-
ticipate while 16 did not complete their questionnaires.
Being a primary caregiver involved participants who pro-
vided unpaid physical support such as helping in activities of
daily living, shopping, food preparation, helping in adminis-
tering medication, overseeing medical appointment, finan-
cial, and emotional support to PLWHA.
Confidentiality was ensured through deleting any contact
information, retrieving and coding the questionnaires imme-
diately they were completed. The study was submitted to the
UCTH Ethics and Research Committee, who gave the
approval for conducting the study. Consent was also obtained
from the Managing Director of Positive Development
Foundation who helped to identify PLWHA caregivers.
Informed consent was also obtained from study participants
following full description of the aims and objectives of study.
Participants were appreciated for their time.
Instrument and Measures
Data was collected using structured questionnaires adminis-
tered by the researchers themselves and through the help of
trained field assistants. Some questionnaires were delivered
to the respondents by face-to-face contact, while some were
deposited with them to fill and return within one week. All
4 SAGE Open
the questionnaires were translated into Efik (the native lan-
guage of the people) and back-translated into English by
experts to ensure that there was no loss of meaning. The Efik
(local dialect) version was administered to caregivers with
little or no education. The structured questionnaires con-
sisted of 41 items, 7 demographic variables, 22 from Zarit
Burden Interview (ZBI) scale and 12 measuring social sup-
port. Measurements of the reliability of the instruments were
achieved using test­retest method. The instruments were
administered to 10 HIV caregivers in Calabar South. Two
weeks later, the same instruments were administered on the
same subjects. Their responses during the two occasions
were correlated using Pearson product­moment correlation
to obtain a reliability coefficient ranging from 0.85 to 0.96.
Demographics
The demographic variables consisted of seven items includ-
ing information on age, marital status, occupation, highest
educational qualification, household income level, number
of people in the household, and duration of care. Duration of
care was categorized into two levels to determine the extent
of involvement with caregiving. Duration of care was pre-
defined for the caregivers.
Caregivers Burden
Burden of care was assessed with the ZBI scale. 22 items
validated ZBI scale with reliability coefficient ranging from
0.88 to 0.92. This scale is made up of 22 items which mea-
sures caregivers' perceptions as caregiving demands, it
reflects the degree of physical, emotional and social impact
of caregiving on caregivers while providing care for PLWHA
(Zarit, 2004). The respondents indicated the discomfort they
experienced of particular items on a 5-point Likert-type scale
ranging from 0 to 4. The total score ranged from 0 to 88 and
a high score correlated with higher level of burden.
Support
A pilot tested structured questionnaire with a reliability coef-
ficient of .85 to .96 was used to measure social support. The
questionnaire consisted of 12 items which assessed the avail-
ability of support information, financial help, emotional sup-
port available to caregivers and help with caregiving.
Respondents indicated the extent of support they received
from each item on a 4-point Likert-type scale, ranging from
lots of support, some support, very little support and no
support.
Data Analysis
Data collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS 16.0) software to generate the
frequency and percentages of the values. By the application
of inferential statistics (chi-square test), the level of signifi-
cance was also determined at the p value of .05. The ZBI
scale scores ranged from 0 to 88; 0 to 20 represented little or
no burden; 21 to 40, mild to moderate burden; 41 to 60, mod-
erate to severe burden; and 61 to 88, severe burden (Zarit,
2004). The support instrument was summed up into two,
availability of support for "lot of support and some support,"
lack of support for "very little support and no support."
Results
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Table 1 shows the sociodemographic variables of 260 care-
givers who participated in the study. The majority of the
respondents were females 199 (76.5%) while 61 (23.5%)
respondents were males who voluntarily took up the caregiv-
ing roles. Of the 260 respondents, 22 (8.5%) females and 3
(1.2%) males aged between 10 and 20 years, 31 (11.9%)
females and 8 (3.1%) males aged between 21 and 30 years.
The majority 63 (24.2%) females and 22 (8.5%) males aged
between 31 and 40 years, 46 (17.7%) females and 15 (5.8%)
males aged between 41 and 50 years while 37 (14.2%)
females and 13 (5.0%) males aged between 51 years and
above. The data also showed that majority of respondents
were single females (93/35.8%), with tertiary education
(77/29.6%) and were employed (89/34.2%). This study
shows that 49 (18.8%) females left school to care for PLWHA
(Table 1).
Duration of Care Among Caregiver
The study revealed that majority 162 (62.3%) respondents
(145females and 17males) spent between 9 and 12 hr/day
providing care to PLWHA. 52 (20.0%) respondents ((16
females and 36males) provided 3 to 8 hr of care, while 46
(17.7%) respondents provided 13 to 24 hr/day care to
PLWHA (Table 1).
Majority 109 (41.9%) of the respondents (90 females and
19males) had provided care between 1 and 2 years, 101
(38.9%) respondents (67 females and 34 males) had been
caregivers for less than 1 year, 38 (14.6%) respondents (32
females and six males) provided care for 2 to 3 years, while
12 (4.6%) respondents (10 females and two males) provided
care for more than 3 years.
Household Income and the Number of People in
the Household
The majority 130 (50%) of the respondents lived below a
household income of US$6.00/day while only 15 (5.8%)
lived with an income of US$14.00 and above. Also, the
majority 153 (58.9%) lived in a household of about three to
six members and only about 19 (7.3%) lived in a household
of one to three persons (Table 2).
Asuquo et al. 5
Gender Difference in the Level of
Burden
Generally, the results revealed a level of burden ranging
between 14 and 71 on ZBI Scale (Table 3); 49 (18.8%)
respondents (females 39, males10) experienced no burden
while providing care, 67 (25.8%) respondents (females 46
males 21) experienced mild to moderate level of burden, 93
(35.8%) respondents (females 69, males 24) experienced
moderate to severe level of burden while 51 (19.6%) respon-
dents (females 45, males six) experienced severe level of
burden in providing care to PLWHA.
The relationship between gender and caregivers burden
assessed with students t test gave a calculated t test value of
1.27 and the tabulated value of 1.62 at p < .05, indicating a
significant relationship between the levels of burden experi-
enced by gender (Table 4).
Availability of Support to Caregivers
The availability of support was categorized into four sections,
namely, providing information on practical and coping skills,
financial assistance, help with caregiving and emotional sup-
port (Figure 1). Among the 260 respondents, 152 (58.5%)
agreed to have received some form of support while 108

(41.5%) received no form of support at all. The form of support
received included 6 (0.2%) information on practical and coping
skills, 36 (13.9%) financial assistance, 72 (27.7%) help with
caregiving, and 38 (14.6%) emotional support. Most caregivers
perceived their role to be extremely stressful with adverse con-
sequences on their health, which some form of support from
individuals or government could have helped to ameliorate.
There was no difference in the types of support by gender.
Willingness to Continue With Caregiving
Among the 260 caregivers, the majority 213 (81.9%) respon-
dents (171 females and 42 males) expressed their desire to
continue with caregiving, while 47 (18.1%) caregivers (28
females and 14 males) did not feel like continuing with care-
giving role (Figure 2).
Out of 108 respondents who received no support, 12
experienced no burden, 23 respondents experienced mild to
moderate burden, the majority 37 respondents experienced
moderate to severe burden while 36 respondents experienced
severe burden. A chi-square value of 25.1 was obtained at p
< 0.05, which showed a significant relationship between
availability of support and caregivers burden (Table 5).
Out of 52 respondents who provided care for 3 to 8 hr/day,
the majority 28 experienced no burden, 10 respondents expe-
rienced mild to moderate burden, eight respondents experi-
enced moderate to severe burden while six respondents
experienced severe burden. Out of 162 respondents who pro-
vided care for 9 to 12 hr/day, 16 experienced no burden, 50
respondents experienced mild to moderate burden, the
majority 73 respondents experienced moderate to severe bur-
den while 23 respondents experienced severe burden.Among
46 respondents who provided care for 13 to 24 hr/day, five
experienced no burden, seven respondents experienced mild
to moderate burden, 12 respondents experienced moderate to
severe burden while the majority 22 respondents experienced
severe burden. A chi-square value of 80.0 was obtained at p
< 0.05, which showed a significant relationship between
duration of care and caregivers burden (Table 6).
Discussion
Caring for those with terminal diseases such as HIV/AIDS is
intrinsically a demanding exercise that requires empathy, an
attribute which is commonly found among the women
(Okoye, 2012). This study showed clearly that the burden of
care on AIDS affected households, rest more on women and
girls than men. These are evident in the number of females
who took up caregiving roles in this study compared with
males. This is similar to UNAIDS (2008) report that caring
for the sick in affected households is relegated to females
thereby increasing the burden of care on females than males.
This finding also corroborates male dominance in the
Nigerian society that culturally assigns caregiving role to
women. But in the absence of eligible females, the males are
often engaged in the caregiving role. This traditional gender
Asuquo et al. 7
norm allows women and girls to provide care but creates the
social barrier against men and boys becoming caregivers,
exacerbating the burden for women and girls. This corrobo-
rates other reports that women are the primary caregivers in
most households and societies (FYI, 2013; NAC & AARP,
2009; UNAIDS, 2008). Takamura and Williams (1998)
observed that in most society, these caregivers often go
unnoticed except by those who depend on their care. VSO
(2006) asserted that the caregiver has a right to be valued,
supported and compensated appropriately to ensure that the
patient receive a high quality care. Primary caregiver some-
times pays a high price and lose opportunities, because pro-
viding care may entail sacrificing school or work to provide
care or taking up caregiving role in addition to existing
reproductive and household economic roles.
Apart from lost opportunities in caregiving, majority of
caregivers experience high burden level as manifested in this
study (Table 3). This indicates the degree to which caregiv-
ing endeavor impacts on emotional, physical health, finan-
cial and social life of the caregiver. The physical labor of
attaining to all the activities of daily living, coupled with lack
of resources to spend on their own medication, produces det-
rimental effects on the carer's own health (Saengtienchai &
Knodel, 2001). The physical and psychosocial impacts of
caregiving on women's well-being are rarely acknowledged,
as most women often ignore their personal health concerns to
consummate the challenges of caregiving (Asuquo, Etowa,
& Adejumo, 2013; UNAIDS, 2008; VSO, 2006; WHO,
2003).
There was a significant relationship between the level of
burden experienced and gender in this study. This is similar
to Allegra (2012) report which asserted that women experi-
enced more burden than men due to their tendency to per-
form more personal care tasks as primary caregivers and are
less likely to obtain formal help. Without appropriate inter-
vention, increased level of burden produces negative conse-
quences which manifest as symptoms of anxiety and
depression and induced changes that could lead to heart dis-
ease, hypertension, psychological worries, loneliness,
increase rate of physiological illness and suppressed immune
responses (Abasiubong et al., 2011; Asuquo, Etowa, &
Adejumo, 2013; Bevans & Sternberg, 2012; Montgomery
et al., 2007; NAC & AARP, 2009; Robison, Fortinsky,
Kleppinger, Shugrue, & Porter, 2009). According to
Takamura and Williams (1998), it is pertinent to perceive
caregivers as potential patients and accord them the neces-
sary support as little can be achieved when their well-being
is jeopardized.
Female caregivers spend more hours and years in provid-
ing care (Table 2) than male counterparts as observed in this
study. This finding is associated with traditional gender
norms which appropriates caregiving to women and for the
men to provide economically for their families, therefore
spending less time in caregiving. This corroborates previous
report (Gomo, 2008; VSO, 2006) that men's low participa-
tion in caregiving are sociocultural since they are expected to
provide financial spport for their families. Reinhard et al.
(2008) affirms that caregiving is a day-to-day obligation and
most family caregivers provide 8 or more hours of care per
week, and one in five caregivers may provide more than 40
hr of care per week. This finding is comparable with Family
Caregiver Alliance (2003) who affirmed that even when men
provide assistance, female caregivers spend as much as 50%
more time providing care than male caregivers. This study
further revealed that providing care ranges from short period
of time to full-time commitment and a significant relation-
ship (p <0.05) exist between duration of care and caregivers
burden (Table 6). This also agrees to other reports asserting

that whether it is for a short period of time or over extended
years, caregiving is a normative life challenge which exacer-
bates the burden of caregivers without adequate coping strat-
egies (Cavanaugh, 1998; Chambers, Ryan, & Millar, 2001).
There was limited support to caregivers in terms of informa-
tion on practical and coping skills, financial assistance, help
with caregiving and emotional support to caregivers (Figure 1).
Caregivers took up the caregiving role without educational
preparation and in most cases unfamiliar with the type of care
they must provide or the extent of care needed. The lack of sup-
port may be attributed to the low value placed on caregiving,
especially when caregiving is dominated by females.
UNAIDS (2008) and VSO (2006) asserted that gender
bias may play a significant role in the none recognition and
low value assigned to the "care economy" which is part of
the unremunerated work performed by women. The need to
acknowledge and celebrate family caregivers as one of the
notable strengths of our nation's families and communities
cannot be overemphasized as no one can afford to pay the
costs of replacing all informal caregivers with paid personnel
(Takamura & Williams, 1998). Chambers et al. (2001)
emphasized that it is prejudice to assume that carers have
necessary knowledge and skills to care for an ill relative
without some form of support or training. Similarly, Rose
(1997) affirmed that providing information on practical and
coping skills plays important role in caregiver's effective
management of burden and any associated stress the care-
giver may experience. The need to support caregivers is con-
sistent with most literatures on support needs. UNAIDS
(2008) and Saengtienchai and Knodel (2001) also agreed that
without proper training on practical and coping skills, ade-
quate information and supplies, there is the risk of exposure
to communicable opportunistic infections. Fear of HIV con-
tagion can cause considerable anxiety on the part of caregiv-
ers, especially if they are not well informed about the actual
risks (Asuquo, Adejumo, et al., 2013).
This study also revealed a significant relationship (p <
0.05) between support and caregiver's burden. Therefore,
support in form of information and training on caregiving
should be given to caregivers before the commencement of
caregiving role. Therefore, with the global commitment to
attain universal access to prevention, care, support and treat-
ment for those PLWHA, the need to reflect on what these
goals might mean in terms of burden on women and girls
should be considered (VSO, 2006).
In spite of the high level of burden perceived by caregivers,
many still showed the willingness to continue in caregiving
role. This may be attributed to strict adherence to cultural
expectation, fraternal love for the sick and sheer need.
Observations akin to the role theory of Berg-Weger,
McGartland Rubio, and Tebb (2000) suggest that caregivers
strive to fulfill a normative expectation to avoid criticism by
others. Okoye (2012) affirmed that this normative role in
Nigeria is backed by persistent influence of traditional norms,
values and behavior, practiced as deified and not routines. This
also conformed to Davis (2012) empirical study on role the-
ory, which affirmed that a person's behavior is indirectly or
directly influenced by the social environment. But willingness
to continue with caregiving role depend on caregivers inter-
nalize coping behavior (McKee et al., 1999) and the patient's
symptom may play a critical role in accounting for levels of
caregiver's depressiveness or willingness to continue in care-
giving role (Given et al., 2005). Majority of those that were
not willing to continue with caregiving role fell among family
caregivers that did not receive any form of support, spending
more than 9 hr/day in providing care. This is similar toAsuquo,
Adejumo, et al., (2013) and Habid and Rahman (2010) who
asserted that with increased burden and limited support, care-
givers experience serious burnout and are physically and psy-
chologically disabled. UNAIDS (2008) and Zarit (2002)
recommended the provision of social support and counseling
before role assumption to alleviate burden of caregiving and
enhance willingness to continue with role.
Conclusion/Recommendation
Over the past decade, improved antiretroviral regimens, con-
cerns about the cost of inpatient care and consumer's prefer-
ences have shifted HIV/AIDS care from hospitals to home
and community settings. This shift has placed heavy burden
on the family and friends of HIV positive individuals, and
most of them had very little knowledge of HIV management
or available resources. Strategies for counteracting caregiv-
ing stressors must be addressed by recognizing and support-
ing family caregivers as well as seeking measures to enhance
involvement of male in family caregiving. This could be
achieved through campaigns to create awareness on associ-
ated burden of care on women and the encouragement of
equal distribution of household and caregiving responsibili-
ties. The strengthening of health care systems to provide
information on practical and coping skills to caregivers of
PLWHA, will reduce the burdens that caregiving poses on
them. The government should provide as a matter of urgency
hospices where PLWHA can meet with medical profession-
als for advice. Counseling sessions should be organized reg-
ularly to present a forum where caregivers could air their
problems and challenges encountered during caregiving ser-
vices. The need also arises for the recognition of primary
caregivers as potential patients, and the formulation of policy
that recognizes and support female caregivers of PLWHA in
Africa. This will ensure caregiver's right to high quality care
through the development of a standardized assessment for-
mat to assess caregivers during each hospital visit.
Limitation
This study was limited to caregivers of PLWHA in Calabar
municipality. It was also not possible to identify households
that were predominantly male or female controlled. The instru-
ment used did not measure the HIV status of the caregivers.
