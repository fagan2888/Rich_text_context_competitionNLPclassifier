Introduction
The coastal areas are subject to an increased pressure by
regional alterations and global changes. The drivers can be
many, of which climate change and source sink alternation
are major. Among coastal issues, near-shore erosion has
become a major threat worldwide. Sediment erosion and
accretion being natural processes, any anthropogenic
influence exacerbates the environmental condition of the
coast. The population density and the developmental activ-
ities along the coastal belt accelerate the semi to perma-
nent modification in an irreversible way. Every country
has reported erosion and accretion, whereas emphasis is
being laid on coastal zone management and proper budget-
ing. Around 45.5% of Indian coastline is undergoing
coastal erosion, while about 19.8% of coastline is found to
be stable and 35.7% of coast shows signs of accretion
(Rajawat et al., 2015).
Monitoring coastal erosion is undeniable due to its wide
range of impacts to the livelihood. For a sustainable coastal
management, it is necessary to understand the interrela-
tionship between the physical processes and the forcing
factors, and their effects on the coastal system. Coast can
be studied in terms of shoreline dynamics (Boak and
Turner, 2005) or in terms of near-shore morphological
changes. Understanding the processes involved in coastal
erosion requires awareness on the interactions between
onshore and offshore environmental processes that
includes wave energy and propagation direction, episodic
weather events and trends in climate change, the materials
on the coast and the supply or extraction of sediments. In
Operational strategy to monitor coastal
erosion in tropical areas

Abstract
Assessment of coastal erosion is of high significance given the fact that the coastal communities are densely populated
areas and have an influence on the food cycle directly and indirectly. Continuous monitoring is essential part of the
work for any intervention to be carried out owing to the seasonal and inter-annual variability. The article discusses the
measurement criteria and stages in an operational plan for a monitoring exercise, preparation and execution. Erosion
can be due to a variety of natural and anthropogenic causes in general. The topic draws attention of both researchers
and coastal communities equally. This article explains the need for operational strategies for an optimal monitoring of
coastal erosion. Demonstration of such methodology was presented with a case study at a micro-tidal sandy beach
located in Tamil Nadu. A generic set up for a plan boundary to measure met-ocean parameters over a time and spatial
extent covering the beach and near-shore sediment regime, shore face and surf zone hydrodynamics is discussed. For
a detailed understanding, numerical models are set up against the measurements to have a feel of the spatial variability.
Validation was taken up extensively and the predictions were used to enhance the measurements in spatial and temporal
scales, advantages with such setup.

addition, the influence of man-made structures can greatly
alter the natural regime (Archetti and Zanuttigh, 2010;
Granja and Pinho, 2012). The monitoring methods should
be as comprehensive as possible to obtain important infor-
mation on regional bathymetry along with natural features
and materials (Holland et al., 2009). Coastal morphology
and its dynamics have to be quantified over time and ero-
sion risks have to be evaluated considering present and
potential future scenarios.
Several methods from traditional beach surveying to
remote sensing are in practice for coastal morphodynamic
monitoring. Static measurements are employed to conduct
profile surveys and slope of the beach. Although remotely
sensed data have also been successfully used for coastal
monitoring, the results were accurate to the order of the
resolution and validation undertaken. Satellite radar, par-
ticularly SyntheticAperture Radar (SAR), were used to get
the shoreline information (Niedermeier et al., 2000) and
aerial digital photography used to obtain three-dimen-
sional (3D) information through photogrammetric analysis
(Cowart et al., 2010; Fletcher et al., 2003). Alternatively
fixed video imagery (Archetti and Zanuttigh, 2010;
Davidson et al., 2007) are also used which provide con-
tinuous data, which can have an optimal temporal resolu-
tion, but to limited stretches.
Laser surveys can deliver similar or slightly better (10­
15 cm) accuracy in the vertical component and can be an
alternative to aerial photography techniques. The portabil-
ity of the equipment has facilitated rapid use, but the data
handling and processing are anchors in its advancement. A
recent approach to topographic surveys is videogramatic
mobile mapping, where 3D coordinates are extracted from
stereo video images and are used to monitor the shoreline
changes periodically.
The generalisation of GPS (Global Positioning System)
methods, particularly those using Real-Time Kinematic
corrections, has facilitated analysis of spatial variability
allowing accurate 3D data to be collected both rapidly and
at high spatial resolution (Barnard and Warrick, 2010).
This has been the technology deployed and is still widely
in use for such assessments.
Operational strategy
A broad view on the composite nature of the coastal pro-
cesses is essential for anticipated monitoring. The coastal
zone management schemes pertinent to the area of interest,
both technical and socio economic, should be the basis of
the planning in general. The present methodology needs
adaptive methods to be developed in grabbing comprehen-
sive understanding of the system with existing state-of-
the-art facilities and minimising cost and uncertainties.
The strategic objectives for all inclusive plan elements
have an important role in up keeping the safety against
hazards and formulate a `Frame of Reference'. It also aids
in regulating the short-term and long-term management
practices.
There are extensive management and monitoring strate-
gies conceived worldwide particularly for coastal erosion
issues. CONSCIENCE is one such project launched in
2007 to enhance the implementation of scientific, sustain-
able coastal erosion management in Europe (Marchand,
2010). National integrated coastline management strategy
is formulated and implemented by France since 2011 with
priorities to develop coastline monitoring, to prepare strat-
egies that can be shared by public and private stakeholders
and to move towards a policy for land planning by finding
methods for financial intervention. The National Coastal
Zone Management Program, the US programme, instituted
by NOAA through the US Coastal Zone Management Act
of 1972 developed to protect, restore and responsibly
develop its nation's diverse coastal communities and
resources. Many coastal countries have its policy and
action plans to manage its coastal resources.
In the Indian context, the action plan for integrated
coastal management became more important due to rapid
developmental activities that degrade coastal resources in
the past three decades. The data for research and planning
were very scarce. Recognising the importance of data for
coastal and oceanographic research, National Institute of
Ocean Technology (NIOT), Chennai, instituted many
operational monitoring programmes for data acquisition
around the Indian coast. Monitoring programmes that are
successfully initiated by the institute includes (a) Coastal
Monitoring System that sets up measurements for tide,
waves, currents and met-ocean parameters, (b) installation
and monitoring of HF Radar that measure waves and sur-
face currents to a maximum radius of 200 km from the
coast and (c) Ocean Observation Systems that widely
deploy instruments in the open ocean to measure all ocean-
ographic and meteorological parameters. The data sets
obtained through these programmes are extensively used
for many management plan and actions. A separate pro-
gramme, Sustainable Shoreline Management (SSM) pro-
ject, is organised by the institute for stabilisation of coast
by adapting different erosion control measures along the
erosion-prone coastal stretches in India.
According to the Concepts and Science for Coastal
Erosion Management (Marchand, 2010), a Commission
of the European Communities (EC)-funded project
describes the decision-making technique for operational
beach management in a four-stage processes such as the
following: (a) quantitative state concept defines the pre-
sent state of the coast and its natural behaviour, (b) bench-
marking process specifies whether any actions are
required, (c) intervention procedure provides a detailed
definition of what action is required when the benchmark
values are exceeded and finally (d) evaluation procedure,
through feedbacks the effectiveness of the management
actions will be assessed.

For the first two stages wherever secondary data are
available with prerequisite accuracy, detailed measure-
ments are not required. Otherwise, a strategic plan of
measurements has to be carried out to understand the
localised physical and environmental conditions that regu-
late the natural behaviour of the coast. The presence of
database for a remote site/coastal village is difficult to
establish, unless a base line study has been carried out.
This article is built on such occasion and the details of set-
ting up an operational plan for measuring the parameters
that influence the sediment transport of the coast. The plan
is optimised by numerical modelling from which areas of
increased sensitivity to specific processes at the site are
identified and field measurements are modified to suite the
data need to be collected.
Criteria in developing operational strategy for
erosion monitoring
Management plans are site-specific and hence monitoring
should adhere to the programme in addition to collection
of standardised data set. Primary data play a substantial
role in every project management, and a specific field
operational strategy for measurements is, therefore, criti-
cal. The operational strategies are mainly developed for
primary data acquisition to implement an effective field
campaigning plan. Suitable control measures are pro-
posed based on the data quality and numerical model
results.
The initial programme planning will be based on how
to address the problem and the need for the coast (immedi-
ate and long time), with stakeholder's consultation if any.
A thorough search for secondary data follows with a pre-
liminary large-scale modelling effort to understand the
local circulations if any. Although the secondary sources
provide an insight on the regional circulation, an intro-
spective view of the system has to be evaluated whether it
addresses the primary problem, otherwise unconvinced; a
proper data collection strategy is envisaged. In the case of
insufficient data, a detailed operational field programme
can be planned and applied.
As there exist several ways of estimating the loss/ero-
sion, both analytical and numerical, a general view has to
be taken without any bias. A simple numerical model
should be built with sensitivity analysis of different cali-
bration parameters for the problem understudy. Then a
control boundary has to be chosen and measurements for
validating the concept should be planned. It follows by
choice/availability of instruments, time and spatial scales
of measurement to be listed. A detailed financial implica-
tion has to be prepared and should undergo external assess-
ment for funding, after which deployments have to be
undertaken on the approved time scales.
NIOT has undertaken such deployments for research,
for more than two decades. Over time, different systems
were tried and a systematic operational strategy, as shown
in Figure 1, was developed for undertaking beach mor-
phology and erosion cases.
Sivakholundu et al. (2014) have given a brief overview
on the problem. This study is formulated based on it. The
area falling in a micro-tidal region with minimal water
level gradients, greater emphasis was laid on other param-
eters. This includes met-ocean elements, observed inde-
pendently against requirement.
Site description
The said site falls on the south of Chennai, India. Kadalore
Chinnakuppam, Kadalore Periyakuppam (KPK) and
Aalikuppam are three villages located closely within a dis-
tance of 0.5 km to the south of palar estuary (Figure 2).
This region has undergone severe erosion since 2011,
owing to tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, namely,
Thane in December 2011, Nilam in October 2012 and
Madi in December 2013, which created a permanent drift
in coastline kinetics. The beach has not recovered natu-
rally over subsequent years. This resulted in exposure of
coastal buildings to direct wave battering (Figure 3).
Generally, east coast is understood to have a net northward
drift with seasonal inversion. The discharges through the
river are largely uncertain owing to upstream dams and
non-perennial nature.
Field observation plan
At first, a field monitoring plan has been prepared to quan-
tify variation in the beach volume over a period. Real-
Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS surveys were employed to
establish beach profiles. Surveys were conducted every
month at spring low tides. The unit width volumes along
with gridded data sets on very fine site data were calcu-
lated across the entire stretch. Littoral Environmental
Observation (LEO) was carried out to have a manual feel
on the breaking characteristics and estimate long-shore
current (Figure 4) by using simple methods proposed by
Schneider (1981).
Annual changes in the beach area above water level
(Figure 5) were carried out in Shoreline and Nearshore
Data System (SANDS) package and net erosion has been
observed. The net annual average long-shore sediment
transport rate calculated using Central Electricity
Regulatory Commission (CERC) formula (Coastal
Engineering Manual, 2002) is 0.33 × 106 m3 (Table 1). The
magnitude is in acceptable limits with existing literature
(Jena et al., 2001). With a brief understanding of the net
changes, a process-based model is planned for further
assessment. This includes wave transformation and two-
way coupled flow hydrodynamics. Coupled wave and
hydrodynamic model has been used by Bhaskaran et al.
(2014), Murty et al. (2014), Gayathri et al. (2016) and
138 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)
Murty et al. (2016) to study cyclonic impacts on coast inun-
dation in a regional level. The present model domain is
constructed such that it reflects all the above-mentioned
shallow water processes. This requires a calibration of flow
model to properly represent the wave refraction by the
current, circulation cells if any. An initial validation
against measurements is essential as the sensitivity of
littoral transport to friction is expected to be high.
Keeping above aspects, a deployment plan has been
prepared (Figure 2). After a thorough sensitivity assess-
ment, feasibility for deploying instruments was exten-
sively deliberated and measurement depths are arrived.
The collection strategy includes continuous and rapid
measurement sessions. The measurement scheme planned
includes a current meter in the northern section, a tide in
southern portion and waves offshore. An integrated meas-
urement inside the control boundary at two locations was
planned for the validation. LEO observations were carried
out on a daily basis for a long-term assessment.
Instruments used
Bathymetry was obtained from field surveys using echo
sounder and DGPS, logged on the Hypack software.
Measurements such as wave, current and water levels have
been carried out for 16 days between 29 January 2016 and
13 February 2016.
Wave measurement was carried out at three locations by
instruments of different make. Datawell make GPS-based

depth, around 7 km offshore from Kadalur Periyakuppam.
Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) is deployed at 12 m,
4 m water depths in line with the first location. The advan-
tages of this deployment include collection of wave, cur-
rent and tide information simultaneously.
The Wave and Tide Recorder (WTR) measures tide and
RCM 9 captures the current data. LEO plates were used
and GPS floats were deployed for the calibration. Trained
personnel were deployed for carrying out the surf zone
characteristics including LEO.
Numerical model
The numerical model was setup on Delft3D suite. The
model domain was aligned with the control boundary, with
incremental resolution curvilinear grids (Figure 4). A cou-
pled wave and flow model was simulated to calibrate with
the data measured off KPK at 12 m depth. Measured wave,
tide and current data sets are used as model boundaries to
assess the calibration of underlying variables. Bursts in
data are avoided as current generation numerical models
become computationally expensive for such assessments.
A comprehensive validation has been undertaken against
measurements.
Although the measurements are verified and quality
controlled, certain stretches remain flagged and authentic-
ity cannot be established. Such data sets were kept in sus-
pension. Although the beach erosion can be largely
attributed to the wave and calibration of the model has
been undertaken extensively, the third-generation model

140 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)
still has limitations in very shallow water. Sensitivity to
different formulations is not undertaken at the moment and
standard cases are expected to be representative. Wind-
induced circulations in shallow water is another major fac-
tor, which can alter the tidal flow direction.
The above model has been input with boundaries
derived from the global models on a time-to-time basis,
and the surf zone width and long-shore current were esti-
mated. The sediment transport model of Van Rijn (2007)
was used to estimate the drift. The advantage of the two-
dimensional (2D) model was taken to assess the formation
of bars. The model-derived depth-averaged velocity for
sea and swell conditions (Figures 6 and 7) along the coast
clearly captures the pattern of near-shore currents due to
breaking waves from which the point of measurement is
further planned to observe more intensively. The results
are validated against LEO measurements, as presented in
Table 2. With these generated information, the observation
locations were altered spatially to capture the required
along-shore current characteristics both spatially and tem-
porally, the bathymetry surveys on the bar migrations.
With above-said strategy, LEO data set for over 3 years
was collected so far.
Conclusion
The present coast is observed to be influenced by tropical
climate system and that of Bay of Bengal, having two

monsoon spells with seasonal winds and driven circula-
tion. Additionally, storm waves batter the coast at least
once in a year, which sets different erosional rates on the
coast within the season. So a systematic deployment plan
under the adopted operational strategy is to be followed.
Erosion control measures for any coast requires an
extensive understanding of the coastal setting and sedi-
ment transport patterns. Measurements in near-shore envi-
ronments are often tedious and more expensive due to
uncertain environmental conditions with breaking waves,
swift currents and surprisingly vandalism. Innovative
methods wielded out of experience are adapted for each
specific cases. The operational strategy thus plays a vital
role in data collection methodology to find a suitable solu-
tion based on the existent scenarios. It has to be understood
that the strategies often differ with issues faced by the
coast of interest.
With the given methodology of measurements at site,
calibration and numerical modelling prediction going hand
in hand according to the operational strategy setup for this
location, desirable along-shore currents were achieved.
The strategy also recommends long-term field measure-
ments for a complete understanding of the site.
