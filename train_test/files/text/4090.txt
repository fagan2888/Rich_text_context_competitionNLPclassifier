Scaling down
Ronald L Breiger
Abstract
While ``scaling up'' is a lively topic in network science and Big Data analysis today, my purpose in this essay is to articulate
an alternative problem, that of ``scaling down,'' which I believe will also require increased attention in coming years.
``Scaling down'' is the problem of how macro-level features of Big Data affect, shape, and evoke lower-level features and
processes. I identify four aspects of this problem: the extent to which findings from studies of Facebook and other Big-
Data platforms apply to human behavior at the scale of church suppers and department politics where we spend much of
our lives; the extent to which the mathematics of scaling might be consistent with behavioral principles, moving beyond a
``universal'' theory of networks to the study of variation within and between networks; and how a large social field,
including its history and culture, shapes the typical representations, interactions, and strategies at local levels in a text or
social network.
Keywords
Scaling up, scaling down, situated networks, cultural templates, scope conditions
Network science research in the computational, social,
and biological sciences is increasingly focused on data-
sets of thousands and even millions of nodes and com-
parably massive sets of connections among them--for
example, in gene interaction networks or social media
datasets. Well over a decade ago my colleagues and I,
falling in step with many other researchers, began
asking, ``How well do the different analytical techniques
and algorithms `scale up' to large networks . . . ?''
(Breiger et al., 2003: 5). Traditional concepts of network
centrality, for example, and attendant shortest-path and
betweenness metrics, are often impractical to compute
for large-scale networks, even on very fast computers.
More fundamentally, the phenomenology of taking
account of all possible links, which is what these metrics
do, may well be appropriate for a small face-to-face
group or for several dozen trading partners, but inappro-
priate for the structuring and operation of networks at
very large scale. Much of the success of Big Data science
has consisted of formulating for large datasets algo-
rithms that are more efficient and appropriate, and that
``scale up'' only linearly with the number of nodes and
edges in a graph (Palmer et al., 2003).
While ``scaling up'' is a lively topic in network science
and Big Data analysis today, my purpose in this essay is
to articulate an alternative problem, that of ``scaling
down,'' which I believe will also require increased atten-
tion in coming years. ``Scaling down'' is the problem of
how macro-level features of Big Data affect, shape, and
evoke lower-level features and processes.
A premise of a great deal of network science and
Big-Data analysis of online behavior is that ``the web
sees everything and forgets nothing'' (Golder and
Macy, 2014: 132). Large-scale studies of Internet
behavior often make use of what is in this sense thought
to be an unmediated study of social interactions, and it
is not at all rare for authors of such studies to claim,
from the analysis of millions of Facebook posts, find-
ings about human behavior that are said to be ``in con-
trast to prevailing assumptions'' in social science such
as Festinger's (1954) social comparison theory formu-
lated from research on small human groups (Kramer
et al., 2014: 8788, 8790).

As I envision it, the alternative problem of ``scaling
down'' addresses four often-interrelated features of Big
Data and network science research that are routinely
ignored or accorded insufficient attention, to the detri-
ment of progress in research. First, whereas many stu-
dies have been undertaken of massively large systems
such as social networking sites, an under-researched
question is the extent to which the behavioral findings
of these studies ``scale down,'' i.e. apply to human
groups and organizations of moderate size (dozens or
hundreds), where most human social life takes place
and is likely to continue to do so. This is the question
of the extent to which Big-Data research applies to
human behavior at the human scale of church suppers
and department politics in which we spend much of our
lives. Second, what are the behavioral processes that
lead to the macro-level outcomes? The research com-
munity has produced stunningly impressive and work-
able mathematical models of how processes at lower
levels (among individuals, say) might cumulate to
high-level complexity (e.g. Lusher et al., 2013;
Morris, 2003), or how bags of words from multiple
topics might spill together to form texts (Blei, 2012).
However, there has been precious little attention paid
to formulating micro-processes that reflect actual
behavior. Big Data has no analog to behavioral eco-
nomics, the study of when and why actors follow or
depart from the postulated model (Thaler, 1994).
Third, network science and Big Data often see them-
selves as scaling ``up'' to generalizations that are freed
from the shackles of particular texts, and to findings
that apply universally to ``all'' networks whether power
grids, gene interactions, or Facebook friending. Scaling
``down'' would recognize the possibility that, the bigger
the dataset in the case of a particular research question,
the greater are the opportunities to search for variation
within the case, to contextualize its features in such a
way as to lead to a distinctive form of case-based gen-
eralization (George and Bennett, 2005). Fourth,
``scaling down'' refers to the problem of how a large
social field, including its history and culture, shapes the
typical representations, interactions, and strategies at
local levels in a text or social network.
In brief: (a) the degree of applicability of Big Data
research to small- and moderate-sized social groups, (b)
the study of when actors behave as if the mathematical
mechanisms postulated to generate Big Data were true,
(c) the relative utility of binning Big Data into local con-
texts, and (d) the production of local action from macro-
level processes are all problems in ``scaling down.'' I will
say a bit more in turn about each of the four aspects of
``scaling down'' that I have identified.
a. Scope conditions. Festinger (1954), on social com-
parison processes, pertains to ``peer groups'' or
``primary groups'' of the order of 101 members.
Kramer et al. (2014) studied 6.89 Â 105 Facebook
users, by manipulating the emotional expressions in
the news feeds each user received.1 People who
received positive emotion updates expressed positive
emotion reactions, not the negative reactions pre-
dicted by Festinger's social comparison theory or
by Turkle's (2011) more contemporary consider-
ation of how technology affects social life. Kramer
et al.'s assertion that their finding is ``in contrast to
prevailing assumptions'' of social science is but-
tressed, in the authors' opinion, by the ability of
Big Data to detect even such a small effect as the
one they found in this instance (2014: 8790). It's not
clear to this reader, however, why results on
Facebook should be expected to scale down so as
to apply in the same way to peer groups. We live on
the Internet, but we also and simultaneously live in
very small ``primary groups'' of the sort Festinger
was addressing. My own guess is that the difference
is ``strong'' culture (which is pervasive in peer
groups) vs. the ``weak'' culture of online friending
(Schultz and Breiger, 2010). I don't see why ``the
task of the researcher is to see online behavior as
social behavior, the kind that might occur in any
field site, be it a remote village, a law office, or a
high school cafeteria'' (Golder and Macy, 2014:
113). To be sure, online behavior is a very distinctive
and increasingly prominent form of social behavior,
and tools for analyzing Big Data open up the study
of online behavior in ways that are both innovative
and exciting for sociology. Nonetheless, Festinger
(1950: 278) himself reviewed experimental studies
showing that behavior in small face-to-face groups
like remote villages, (many) law offices, and school
cafeterias differed along multiple dimensions from
more distanced forms of communication. Several
contemporary leaders in Big Data analysis have
coined the term ``Big Data hubris'' to refer to the
often implicit assumption that Big Data is a substi-
tute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional
data collection and analysis (Lazer et al., 2014).
b. A behavioral model? Snijders et al. (2012) take note
of the many ingenious mathematical models that
have been devised for Big Data analysis. Their
main point, however, is the suggestion that ``instead
of trying to find micro-processes that lead to certain
aggregate network properties based on mathemat-
ical tractability, one could follow a different analyt-
ical strategy and try to come up with micro-
processes that match with actual behavior. And
this is exactly where social and behavioral research
can play a role.'' Research of Yotam Shmargad
(2014) moves decisively in this direction in order
to model strength of ties and social media use.
2 Big Data & Society
Shmargad analyzed the database of a social media
company that started charging its users to receive
broadcasts in their email address books. Before the
monetization, users' address books were automat-
ically updated each time one of the people they were
connected to changed their contact information.
Afterwards, users had to buy the company's pre-
mium bundle for $60 to continue receiving the
updated information. In a study with the design
of a natural experiment, Shmargad compared how
purchase rates varied with properties of users' net-
works. Among the key findings: while people value
receiving information from their strong ties, they
also highly value receiving information from ties
that are structurally diverse, for example from ties
that connect the focal individual to regions of the
social network with which she would otherwise not
be connected. This study therefore provides a useful
exemplar of how a search for micro-processes that
match users' behavior can lead to improved, rigor-
ous quantitative modeling of social media
networks.
c. Big Data, situated networks. McNely (2012) claims
(in my paraphrase) that ``the paradox of Big Data''
is that we now collect so much data that the chal-
lenge is no longer only quantitative. The paradox
``suggests the inverse: we need more situated, con-
textualized, qualitative studies of communication
practices in an age of Big Data, not less'' (p. 28,
original emphasis). In contrast to recent trends of
scaling up communication infrastructures, McNely
argues that the future of communication design
``must address the challenges of scaling down, of
delivering Big Data in contextual, meaningful, loca-
lized forms'' (p. 28, original emphasis). One pos-
sible way to exploit this paradox is to consider
Big Data corpuses, such as the set of published
US National Security Strategy statements analyzed
by Mohr et al. (2013), as a single ``case'' or type of
discourse that manifests internal variation. Using
natural language processing techniques, Mohr
et al. (2013: 678­686) show how the identification
and relational trajectories of identified actors
(``America,'' ``Yeltsin,'' ``Allies,'' ``Weapons of
Mass Destruction'') can be distilled from the
corpus. How these consequential trajectories
change over time is importantly related to a form
of within-case generalization that is usually asso-
ciated with the situated study of qualitative data
(Goertz and Mahoney, 2012: 10­11, 87­99).2
d. Fields, cultural templates, and automorphic equiva-
lence. Not all networks emerge from processes on
nodes and edges. This statement departs from the
program of Big Data analysis, yet perhaps the rec-
ognition of this point could motivate progress in the
analysis of large-scale data. In many kinds of human
networks, group style--defined as recurrent patterns
of interaction that express a social group's shared
ideas about what constitutes good or adequate par-
ticipation in group settings--provides stylized tem-
plates or ideals for interpersonal interaction
(Eliasoph and Lichterman, 2003). In what sense
are such cultural templates providing the impetus
for predictable interpersonal linkages at the micro-
level (Pachucki and Breiger, 2010), and, in this way,
scaling down? A somewhat similar question can be
posed in molecular biology,3 where certain patterns,
termed network motifs, occur more frequently than
by chance. Kashtan et al. (2004) define families of
motifs such that motifs within families share a
common general theme defined by roles that the
researchers identify using automorphic equivalence
techniques developed in sociology for the study of
social roles. Networks which share a common motif
can have very different generalizations of that motif.
In research that I see as related to the studies men-
tioned above, Lazega et al. (2008) formulate a multi-
level social network analysis via linked design: French
cancer labs have ties (such as mobility of researchers
among them), scientists have network ties (such as
working together), and scientists are affiliated with
labs. This formulation presents what I would like to
identify as ``a duality of scaling up and down'' with
an emphasis on actors' strategies, inter-organizational
control mechanisms, and a distinctively institutional
theory of their coevolution that is being developed bril-
liantly by Lazega and colleagues (especially, Lazega,
2015; Lazega and Prieur, 2014).
In conclusion, I have identified four interrelated fea-
tures of ``scaling down,'' the problem of how macro-level
features of Big Data affect, shape, and evoke lower-level
features and processes. Too often, problems of scaling
down remain merely in the background of Big Data and
network science studies. Recognizing and addressing
them should lead to additional progress in advancing
the study of what Lazer et al. (2014) term an ``all data
revolution,'' wherein innovative analytics using data
from all traditional and new sources are developed and
used to further our understanding of our world.

Notes
1. The PNAS editors accompanied publication of Kramer
et al. (2014) with an ``editorial expression of concern''
due to the absence of an effort to obtain the informed
consent of the subjects. This issue was also highlighted in
newspaper coverage (Goel, 2014).
2. Distinctive features of within-case generalization include the
search for specific pieces of information that decisively sup-
port or undermine a given theory (``smoking gun'' tests),
search for a given piece of evidence that must be present
within an individual case for a hypothesis about that case
to be valid, so that the absence of that information discon-
firms the hypothesis (``hoop tests''), consideration of how
small changes during key historical junctures might have led
the case to follow a different path (``counterfactuals''), and
other methods discussed in Goertz and Mahoney (2012).

interpretation of it on my part.
