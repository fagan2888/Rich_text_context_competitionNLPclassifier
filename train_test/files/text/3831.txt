Article
Broad personality traits such as extraversion and neuroticism
have been shown to influence the expression and interpreta-
tion of facial expressions of emotions and display rules (e.g.,
Fok, Hui, Bond, Matsumoto, & Yoo, 2008; Riggio & Riggio,
2002; Rogers & Revelle, 1998). For example, extraverts
habitually display smiling and laughter more intensely and
more often compared to introverts (Ruch, 2005; see also
Hofmann, Platt, Ruch, Niewiadomski, & Urbain, 2015).
Extraverts also tend to lessen the expressive control over joy,
while increasing the expressive control over contempt (Fok
et al., 2008). Within the extraversion­neuroticism quadrant,
one stable inter-individual differences variable is known to
account for biases in the processing of joy, humor, and laugh-
ter: gelotophobia (the fear of being laughed at; Ruch &
Proyer, 2008a).
Individuals with gelotophobia describe themselves pri-
marily as introvert-neurotics (Ruch & Proyer, 2009). They
express less smiling and laughter (Platt, Hofmann, Ruch, &
Proyer, 2013; Ruch, Hofmann, & Platt, 2015), report experi-
encing less joy in a variety of situations (see Ruch, Hofmann,
Platt, & Proyer, 2014 for a review), and others' positive
laughter is experienced as malicious (Ruch, Altfreder, &
Proyer, 2009). Also, they respond with a marked heart rate
deceleration toward hearing laughter (indicating a "freezing-
like" response; Papousek et al., 2014). Gelotophobes inter-
pret laughter as a weapon utilized for putting them down and
falsely attribute it to mockery directed toward them (Ruch &
Proyer, 2008b). Consequently, they respond fearfully to
benevolent laughter (Ruch & Proyer, 2009), implying a pos-
sible bias in interpreting joy and emotions potentially going
along with laughter/ridicule (i.e., contempt).
Thus, while extraversion and neuroticism partially predict
responses toward joy and contempt, gelotophobia is a specific
trait that biases joy responses and their interpretation (see Ruch
et al., 2014). As gelotophobia goes beyond global personality
dimensions and is also sufficiently different from lower order
concepts such as shame-proneness, timidity, and social anxiety
(Ruch et al., 2014), it is necessary to investigate its relation to
responses and interpretation of joy and contempt smiles.
Therefore, the present research investigated how individuals
with or without gelotophobia respond toward facially expressed
types of smiles (with a special focus on smiles of joy and con-
tempt). This is important, as a bias in perceiving smiles and
laughs might lead to important consequences in social interac-
tions (see Fredrickson, 1998; Johnston, Miles, & Macrae,
2010; Papa & Bonanno, 2008). It is expected that gelotophobes
have a specific bias in interpreting facially expressed smiling

Individual Differences in Gelotophobia
Predict Responses to Joy and Contempt
Jennifer Hofmann1, Tracey Platt1, Willibald Ruch1,
and René T. Proyer1
Abstract
In a paradigm facilitating smile misattribution, facial responses and ratings to contempt and joy were investigated in individuals
with or without gelotophobia (fear of being laughed at). Participants from two independent samples (N
1
= 83, N
2
= 50) rated
the intensity of eight emotions in 16 photos depicting joy, contempt, and different smiles. Facial responses were coded by
the Facial Action Coding System in the second study. Compared with non-fearful individuals, gelotophobes rated joy smiles
as less joyful and more contemptuous. Moreover, gelotophobes showed less facial joy and more contempt markers. The
contempt ratings were comparable between the two groups. Looking at the photos of smiles lifted the positive mood of non-
gelotophobes, whereas gelotophobes did not experience an increase. We hypothesize that the interpretation bias of "joyful
faces hiding evil minds" (i.e., being also contemptuous) and exhibiting less joy facially may complicate social interactions for
gelotophobes and serve as a maintaining factor of gelotophobia.

and laughter, as those displays are linked to being laughed at
(or misattributed ridicule).
The perception of being laughed at may go along with at
least two kinds of laughs and feeling states. First, amused
laughter (equivalent to joyful laughter in its expression; see
Ruch & Ekman, 2001) occurs, when mirthful people are
amused about something or someone, while the "target" is
excluded from the joke, that is, because he or she does not
get the punch line or does not have the in-group knowledge
to understand the joke. This could consequently be misper-
ceived as ridicule, though this is not directly laughing at, but
the others are not laughing with the person. In line with this,
Ruch et al. (2009) demonstrated that auditory-presented
laughs of a positive quality were misperceived by geloto-
phobes. Joyful laughs where perceived as more malicious by
gelotophobes than individuals with no fear, and listening to
the laughter did not lift the cheerful mood from pre to post
the task. Thus, we expect that gelotophobes misinterpret joy-
ful laughter as contemptuous, as those displays of joy are
misinterpreted as laughing at, while individuals with no fear
distinguish between joy smiles and contempt displays.
Second, contemptuous laughter occurs when people are
laughing at somebody else maliciously (as a form of aggres-
sion; Poyatos, 1993). Typically, this would elicit negative
emotions in the person being laughed at (e.g., shame or
anger; Papousek et al., 2014). We expect that expressions of
contemptuous laughter are perceived as such by individuals
with no fear of being laughed at and gelotophobes (i.e., con-
taining contempt), but we also expect that gelotophobes
assign those displays more joy, as they infer that people
enjoy laughing at them (see Ruch & Proyer, 2008a).
Aims of the Present Study
For an empirical test of the hypotheses on joy and contempt
smiles, photos of facially expressed joy and contempt smiles,
as well as expressions of emotions, ambiguous expressions,
and other kinds of smiles were studied (based on the works
of Bänninger-Huber, 1996; Ekman, 1985).1 By adding fur-
ther smiles and emotion expressions beyond joyful and con-
temptuous smiles,2 it could be tested whether the
gelotophobes' bias in the perception is specific to joy and
contempt and not a general inability to judging smiles and
emotion expressions. The basic emotion and ambiguous
expressions were included to conceal the main aim of the
study. Two studies were conducted to investigate responses
(verbal ratings of emotions and facial responses) toward
facially expressed smiles and laughs in individuals with and
without gelotophobia.
In Study 1, ratings of nine emotions toward photos of joy
and contempt smiles, and other smile types were investi-
gated. The hypotheses stated that gelotophobes misperceive
the joy smile and rate the perceived joy lower than the no
fear group, while individuals with no fear of being laughed at
would assign joy (and only joy) to photos of joy smiles
(H1a). Also, it was assumed that gelotophobes perceive joy
smiles as more contemptuous (due to their anticipation of
ridicule; H1b). For contempt displays, it was expected that
gelotophobes would rate contempt high, like individuals
with no fear (H2a). Moreover, gelotophobes would differ
from individuals without gelotophobia by rating joy higher,
as they attribute others to gain enjoyment from ridicule
(H2b). For the rating of other expressions (basic emotions,
smiles, ambiguous expressions), it was expected that indi-
viduals with no fear and gelotophobes would not differ in the
emotion assignment, as gelotophobes do not generally lack
the ability to rate facial expressions of others (see also
Papousek et al., 2009), but have a specific bias in joy and
contempt.
Study 2 included the rating of photos of joy and contempt
in a laboratory setting where also the participants' facial
responses were filmed and coded by the Facial Action
Coding System (FACS; Ekman, Friesen, & Hager, 2002),
giving insight into the facial responses toward joy and con-
tempt. Studies have shown that facial mimicry of smiling
increases the correct interpretation of smiles (e.g., Maringer,
Krumhuber, Fischer, & Niedenthal, 2011). As gelotophobes
have been shown to express joy less frequently and less
intensely (Platt et al., 2013), it was assumed that they show
less frequent joy responses toward photos of joy smiles (H3).
Also, it was expected that they show more contempt
responses toward joy smile photos, as they misattribute joy
smiles to being contemptuous and respond accordingly (H4).
Also, gelotophobes were expected to show more contempt
responses toward contempt expressions (compared with
individuals without gelotophobia), as they are more sensitive
to perceiving this emotion (H5). Beyond the methods uti-
lized in Study 1, Study 2 further accounted for trait positive
affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) to control for any habit-
ual tendency to rate positive emotions lower in low-trait PA
or to rate negative emotions higher in high-trait NA. This
was important because gelotophobia has been shown to go
along with lower levels of joy on a state and trait level (Ruch
et al., 2014). Participants' mood scores before and after the
experimental task were evaluated. It was expected that by
engaging with social stimuli entailing smiling and laughter,
the mood of non-fearful individuals would lift, while geloto-
phobes would not experience the same increase (H6).
Study 1
Method
Participants. The sample consisted of 83 adult volunteers (68
females, 15 males, age range = 18-62, M = 33.06, SD =
11.72). The fear group consisted of 15 participants exceeding
the empirically derived cut-off point for gelotophobia at 2.50
(see Ruch & Proyer, 2008b; M = 2.85, SD = 0.29, minimum
= 2.53, maximum = 3.53; three males, 12 females). Of the
15, 10 were classified as slight, 4 as marked, and 1 as
Hofmann et al. 3
extremely fearful of being laughed at. The no fear group's
gelotophobia scores had a mean of 1.54 (SD = 0.26, mini-
mum = 1.07, maximum = 1.93) and consisted of 68 partici-
pants (age = 18-62, M = 33.24, SD = 11.98; excluding
individuals with borderline gelotophobia n = 32; valued
between 2.00 and 2.49 on the GELOPH<15>; 12 males, 56
females). The gelotophobia mean of the no fear group was
lower than the mean of the gelotophobes, F(1, 82) = 287.68,
p< .001, p
2
= .78.
Instruments. The GELOPH<15> (Ruch & Proyer, 2008b) is
a 15-item standard measure for the subjective assessment of
gelotophobia ("when others laugh in my presence I get suspi-
cious"). All items are positively keyed and utilize a 4-point
answer scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree).
Internal consistency was high ( = .86) in the present sample.
Ruch and Proyer (2008b) derived empirical cut-off points for
slight gelotophobia (2.50-2.99), marked gelotophobia (3.00-
3.49), and extreme fear of being laughed at (3.50-4.00).
The smiling face may hide an evil mind paradigm.This para-
digm was developed to assess individuals'perceptions of joy
and contempt smiles. First, participants were given the cover
story that lay actors were asked to pose certain facial expres-
sions while being in different states of mind. In detail, the
participants were told that the presenters had undergone the
task of getting into one of three predefined frames of mind
(mean-spirited, neutral, benevolent) and then displaying cer-
tain facial configurations of emotions (e.g., joy, fear, sur-
prise) that they had practiced before. The participants were
made aware that the emotional state a presenter displays may
(but also may not) match the frame of mind the presenter was
in. The instruction, thus, facilitated gelotophobia by activat-
ing the notion that the actor might be concealing their true
emotional state when displaying facial expressions. Second,
a selection of 16 photos was then rated for their emotion
content.
The 16 photos contained expressions of joy smiles, con-
tempt smiles, other smile types (phony smiles, "Chaplin,"
masking smiles) based on the work of Bänninger-Huber
(1996) and Ekman (1985), as well as distractor stimuli (sur-
prise, a happy­surprise blend, a photo of "beginning of fear,"
"concentration," and two photos with no facial action unit
[AU; Ekman et al., 2002] present). The latter ambiguous
emotion expressions were considered "noisy" stimuli and
served as distractor stimuli. They facilitated the interpreta-
tion of the frame of mind of the presenter diverging from the
emotion displayed, as the face contained ambiguous infor-
mation. Those photos of ambiguous emotion displays needed
to be included to make the cover story plausible by implying
that the presenters might "leak" their true frame of mind and
to distract from the stimuli of interest, the joy and contempt
smiles (and counteracting any hypotheses building by the
participant). The photos included five presenters of both gen-
ders and were shown individually on a 21-inch computer
screen, head and shoulder close-up view. The participants
rated the perceived intensity of eight emotions to the photo
(anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, shame, surprise)
on a 6-point scale (1 = not at all, 6 = a lot).
Procedure
Generation of the photos.Five FACS-trained presenters
(two males) posed the 16 different smiles, basic emotions,
and ambiguous expressions that were finally selected for the
experiment. The pool of photos was coded with the FACS
(Ekman et al., 2002) by two trained FACS coders to ensure
the convergence between the intended and expressed display.
Three photos were joy smiles in different intensities (Duch-
enne displays [DDs], two times AU6 + 7 + 12; 6 + 12 + 25
+ 263; open mouth implied laughing), three contempt smiles
(AUR14; L6 + L14; 14), two masking smiles (AU6 + 7 + 12
+ 17 + 24; 6 + 12 + 24), one phony (AU12) and "Chaplin
smile" (AU13) each. The distractor stimuli consisted of one
photo for surprise (AU1 + 2), happy surprise (AU1 + 2 + 6
+ 12 + 25), beginning of fear (AU20), beginning of anger/
concentration (AU7), and two neutral photos with no AUs
present.
Study procedure.Participants were recruited through a
newspaper article, which contained a link to the study web-
site, announcing for a study in personality psychology. On
the study website, participants were first asked to fill in the
GELOPH<15>, and then asked to complete a "rating task on
judging faces" (Smiling Face May Hide an Evil Mind Para-
digm). To end the session, participants were debriefed and
thanked for their participation. All participants participated
voluntarily, and individual feedback on selected personality
variables was offered as incentive.
Data analysis strategy.In this quasi-experimental study,
the level of gelotophobia group (gelotophobia vs. no fear)
was the independent variable and the emotion ratings were
the dependent variables. Aggregated scores for emotion rat-
ings of photos with the same content (e.g., all joy smiles)
were computed, leading to one composite score for each
emotion rating for the three DDs, one for the three con-
tempt displays, and one score for the two masking smiles.
The other smiles were analyzed individually. Photos of basic
emotions and ambiguous expressions were used as distrac-
tor items.4 The following analysis strategies were applied for
hypotheses testing: First, for displays with a target emotion
(i.e., joy and contempt), it was of interest whether the tar-
get emotion (i.e., the emotion displayed, for example, joy
for DDs) would be highest for the respective stimuli. For
this, contrasts of the target emotion against the other relevant
emotions (if any) were computed. An empirical cut-off point
for "relevant emotions" was established. Only emotions with
an overall mean rating indicating at least "slight presence of
the emotion" were considered (i.e., overall mean of at least
2.00). Those are reported in each respective section of the

analysis. The consideration of emotions that were at least
slightly present allowed for targeted testing of group differ-
ences in relevant ratings (and not comparing the groups on
ratings which were not chosen to be relevant). Second, group
differences (no fear vs. gelotophobia) were investigated for
the target emotion. Third, it was of interest whether other
emotions were assigned in the rating (with a special focus
on group differences). Differences were investigated with
repeated-measures ANOVAs (gelotophobia group as inde-
pendent, intensity of emotion as dependent, and the emotions
above the cut-off as repeated-measures factors; in the fol-
lowing only referred to as repeated-measures ANOVA). The
main focus lay in the analysis of joy, contempt, and variants
of smiles.
Results
Joy smiles.The aggregated ratings of the three joy smiles
were evaluated for the intensity of the target emotion joy.
Means and standard deviations are presented in Table 1.
Table 1 shows that joy had the highest mean rating across
all eight emotions, and only the contempt rating exceeded
the cut-off in the group of gelotophobes. As expected, a con-
trast comparing joy against contempt showed that joy was
rated more intense than contempt in both groups, F(1, 79) =
202.49, p< .001, p
2 = .72. In line with the expectations, the
interaction between the type of emotion and gelotophobia
group, F(1, 79) = 5.39, p< .05, p
2
= .06, showed that geloto-
phobes rated joy lower than the no fear group; F(1, 80) =
4.29, p< .05, p
2 = .05, confirming H1a. Contempt toward
the joy photos was rated higher in gelotophobes than in the
no fear group, confirming H1b; F(1, 80) = 8.16, p< .01,
p
2
= .07.
Contempt smiles.Contempt, joy, and anger were analyzed
(they exceeded the cut-off). The intensity of the contempt
rating was compared to the other two emotions, showing that
contempt did not differ from the rating of anger, but both
were higher than the ratings of joy, Femotion
(2, 162) = 9.16, p<
.001, p
2 = .10; F
contrast
(1, 81) = 14.37, p< .001, p
2 = .15.
Contrary to the expectation, the interaction (Emotion × Gelo-
tophobia group) was not significant, F(2, 226) = 1.17, p =
.354. This disconfirmed H2a. Still, in line with the expecta-
tions, gelotophobes rated contempt numerically more intense
than the no fear group. Also joy was rated numerically more
intense in gelotophobes than in the no fear group (in the
direction of H2b), and the fearful individuals rated anger less
intense. Nevertheless, the results failed to reach statistical
significance, disconfirming H2a and H2b.
Phony, masking, and Chaplin smiles.In the phony smile, joy
and contempt exceeded the cut-off. The ANOVA showed no
group differences for the level of gelotophobia, F(1, 72) =
0.29, p = .586, occurred. As the masking smiles and the
Chaplin smile had no a priori emotion assignment, they were
analyzed for differences between the two groups in the emo-
tions being at least slightly present. For ratings of masking
smiles, joy, shame, and surprise exceeded the cut-off. The
repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the emotion ratings
differed from each other, with joy being the highest,
F(2, 146) = 46.08, p< .001, p
2
= .39, but the interaction level
Hofmann et al. 5
of Gelotophobia group × Emotion was not significant,
F(2, 146) = 2.19, p = .116, and neither was the effect for the
level of gelotophobia, F(1, 73) = 0.01, p = .984. For the
Chaplin smile, the anger, fear, shame, disgust, contempt, and
surprise ratings exceeded the cut-off point, but did not differ
in intensity, F(5, 395) = 2.18, p = .063, and no group differ-
ence, F(1, 79) = 0.27, p = .681, nor interaction occurred, F(5,
395) = 0.29, p = .919.
Discussion
Our results showed that gelotophobia biases the judgment of
facially displayed joy smiles (and laughs). While individuals
with no fear of being laughed at related only joy to the photos
of joy smiles, gelotophobes responded to these joy smiles by
assigning less joy and more contempt compared with indi-
viduals with no fear (H1a, H1b). This was in line with the
expectation that gelotophobes misperceive the genuine
expression of joy by assuming that the person is ridiculing
them and hiding an "evil mind."Already Hobbes (1651/2010)
related contempt to laughter and ridicule, and Darwin (1872)
claimed,
. . . in the case of derision, a real or pretended smile or laugh is
often blended with the expression proper to contempt, and this
may pass into angry contempt or scorn. In such cases the
meaning of the laugh or smile is to show the offending person
that he or she excites only amusement. (p. 224)
The expectations that contempt smiles are perceived as
more joyful, as well as containing more contempt for gelo-
tophobes compared with individuals with no fear failed to
reach statistical significance (H2a and H2b were discon-
firmed). Thus, the current result replicated the finding of
Ruch et al. (2009), who found that gelotophobes and indi-
viduals with no fear did not differ in judging negative audi-
tory laughter. To conclude, the bias of gelotophobes to
assign more contempt to smiles was specific to genuine
enjoyment displays, as no differences were found for other
smiles. This is the first study to reveal contempt as a rele-
vant emotion in gelotophobia, and a further assessment of
emotion displays needs to verify the findings in an indepen-
dent sample (by also controlling for trait PA and NA, and
mood).
Study 2
Study 2 included the decoding of the 16 photos in the
"Smiling Face May Hide an Evil Mind Paradigm" in a labo-
ratory setting. A sample of independently collected partici-
pants rated the same photos, and their facial responses were
filmed and coded by the FACS, giving further insight into the
responses toward joy and contempt. Also, trait PA and NA
and mood changes pre and post the task were assessed.
Method
Participants. The sample consisted of 50 adults (38 females,
12 males; age range = 18-72 years, M = 39.76, SD = 15.19).
The fear group consisted of 25 adults (eight males; age range
= 18-72 years, Mdn = 38 years) that exceeded the cut-off
score for gelotophobia in an online screening (that led to
invitations to an experiment), as well as at the beginning of
the experiment. The double check helped make sure that the
participants had at least a slight fear of being laughed at. Of
the 25, 11 were classified as slight, 12 as marked, and 3 as
extremely fearful of being laughed at. None of them were
enrolled in therapeutic treatment or consumed psychotropic
medication at the time of the experiment. The no fear group
was formed of 25 participants (4 males; age range = 20-68
years, Mdn = 44 years) that reported no gelotophobia (M =
1.79, SD = 0.40). Their GELOPH<15> scores were lower
than the ones of the fear group (M = 3.00, SD = 0.24),
F(1, 49) = 167.20, p< .001, p
2
= .78.
Instruments. The GELOPH<15> (Ruch & Proyer, 2008b), as
described in Study 1, was applied to assess the individual
differences in gelotophobia. Cronbach's alpha was high
( = .90).
The Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule
(PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) assesses the
independent dimensions of PA and NA with 20 items on a
5-point scale (1 = not at all to 5 = very much). In this study,
PA and NA as traits and states' reliabilities (internal consis-
tency) were higherthan .85.
The smiling face may hide an evil mind paradigm. The 16 pho-
tos of Study 1 were used, but the analyses focused on joy and
contempt smiles only. All other photos were used as distrac-
tor items in the assessment (and to ensure the comparability
of the design with Study 1) but not evaluated. Converging
with Study 1, photos with the same content were aggregated
to composite scores for each emotion rating.
Facial measurements. The FACS (Ekman et al., 2002) is an
anatomically based, comprehensive, objective technique
for measuring all observable facial movements. It distin-
guishes 44 AUs. These are the minimal units that are visu-
ally distinguishable. FACS allows for measurement of the
frequency and intensity of a facial movement. The intensi-
ties range from trace (coded A) to maximum (E; Ekman
et al., 2002).

calendar, where they could choose a date and were given a
personalized login to a website. On the website, they com-
pleted the PANAS trait and the GELOPH<15> (for the sec-
ond time). At the beginning of the study session, the
participants were asked to complete the PANAS state. Then,
participants were left to read the instructions and to complete
the task on the computer.All participants completed the eight
emotion ratings to an example photo. If the task was unclear,
they had the opportunity to ask the experimenter for explana-
tions. The cover story and presentation of the 16 photos, as
well as the ratings, were the same as in Study 1. Participants
completed the task in solitude with the experimenter waiting
in an adjacent room. During the task, a computer-inbuilt
camera unobtrusively videotaped the participant's face.
Afterward, participants filled in the PANAS state measure
again. To end the session, participants were debriefed and
informed about the filming. No participants took the offer to
have the video material deleted. Written consent allowed the
use of the material that was collected. On average, the exper-
imental session lasted 45 minutes. All participants attended
voluntarily, and a personal feedback on the trait measures
was offered. Procedures and interactions were standardized,
and consent was obtained from the local ethic committee.
Facial action coding.Measurements provided full color,
digital format films, which gave a close-up, head-on view
of the participants' face. The facial responses toward pho-
tos were assessed using the FACS. Two FACS-certified
researchers followed a designated procedure to scoring the
AUs relevant for joy smiles (DDs; Ekman, Davidson, &
Friesen, 1990), contempt, and masking smiles. The inter-
rater reliability (Cohen's kappa) for the two coders was K
= .88. Facial variables were formed for responses to each
photo separately. Presence of a DD and its intensity was
coded, defined by the symmetric and simultaneous presence
of AU12 + 6. It may be accompanied by a tightening of the
eyelids (AU7) and/or mouth opening (AU25, 26, 27), but no
other AU. Intensity of DDs was based on the peak intensity
of the AU12. Contempt smiles (unilateral AU14) were coded
in both frequency and intensity. Masking smiles were coded
as AU12 plus markers of any of five negative emotions (sad-
ness, anger, fear, disgust, contempt; see Bänninger-Huber,
1996; Ekman & Friesen, 1982).
Results
Differences in the level of gelotophobia in trait PA and NA.Means
and standard deviations of PA and NA are reported in Table
2. Univariate ANOVAs with the level of gelotophobia (gelo-
tophobia, no fear) as independent and the respective trait as
dependent variable showed that the gelotophobes reported
less PA compared with the no fear group, F(1, 49) = 5.52, p<
.05, p

individuals, F(1, 49) = 4.28, p< .05, p

Emotion ratings toward joy and contempt smile photos.Descrip-
tive statistics for the emotion ratings toward the photos were
computed (see Table 2). Only photos containing joy and con-
tempt smiles were evaluated to replicate the findings of
Study 1.
Table 2 shows ratings for each emotion, but only ratings
that exceeded the cut-off point of being at least slightly pres-
ent were utilized. The cut-off point was equivalent to Study
1 and ensured that only emotions were considered for analy-
ses that were empirically relevant. Table 2 shows that the
ratings of Study 2 replicate those of Study 1, with compara-
ble means and standard deviations. Next, joy and contempt
smile photos were analyzed for the emotions rated and group
differences (level of gelotophobia; gelotophobia vs. no fear).
Joy smiles. For the joy smile photos, the intensity of the
target emotion joy was compared with the only other emotion
exceeding the overall cut-off, contempt.Arepeated-measures
ANCOVA with gelotophobia group as independent, intensity

was computed. PA and NA were added to control for effects
of habitual tendencies to positive and negative emotions,
which might influence the emotion ratings. Results indicated
a significant main effect for the factor Emotion Type (joy and
contempt), F(1, 44) = 57.77, p< .001, p

tion, F(1, 44) = 18.98, p< .001, p

gelotophobes rated joy lower than the no fear group, in line
with H1a, F(3, 48) = 22.09, p< .001, p
2

higher than the no fear group, meeting the expectations of
H1b, F(3, 48) = 8.34, p< .001, p

influences of PA and NA, both interactions of the Type of
Emotion × PA, F(1, 44) = 1.54, p = .221, and NA, F(1, 44) =
1.35, p = .251, were not significant, indicating that the effect
existed independent of PA and NA, respectively. Therefore,
these traits were not controlled for in further analyses.
Contempt smiles. Contempt, surprise, and anger were ana-
lyzed. A repeated-measures ANOVA (gelotophobia group as
independent, intensity as dependent variable, emotions as
repeated measures) was computed. First, a contrast showed
that the contempt ratings differed from both surprise and

(ns, disconfirming H2a).5 Next, the joy rating was tested for
group differences as it was hypothesized that gelotophobes
would attribute joy to contempt smiles and Study 1 revealed
a numerical difference in the expected direction of H2b. The
gelotophobes showed a tendency to rate joy more intense
than the no fear group, F(1, 48) = 3.04, p< .05, one-tailed,

Facial responses towards the photos
Overview.Aggregated scores for the frequency of the
DDs, contempt smiles, and masking smiles6 towards all
16 photos, as well as scores for responses towards photos
showing DDs and contempt smiles, were computed. Non-
parametric analyses were applied for the data on types of
photos as criteria for normal distribution were violated.
Convergence of facial expressions displayed to differ-
ent smiles.It was evaluated whether appropriate mimicry
occurred toward the emotion displayed on the photos (e.g.,
DDs mimicked by DDs). A non-parametric-related sample
Friedman's two-way ANOVA was used to compare the facial
responses toward the DDs. Only the no fear group was con-
sidered for analysis, as a priori assumptions implied that
the gelotophobes respond with less, and also counter-mim-
icry (i.e., facial expressions contrary to those shown in the
photo; see Lanzetta & Orr, 1986). Thus, to confirm that the
approach is suitable to induce convergent facial responses
in participants without specific fears, all individuals without
gelotophobia were chosen for an investigation of the mim-
icry toward the photos. The differences for the frequency of
DDs (dependent variable) to joy photos and contempt photos
(repeated measures) were computed. The results yielded a
significant main effect, 2(df = 1) = 10.89, p< .001, showing
that the facial mimicry toward DDs differed. Wilcoxon rank-
order comparisons showed that more DDs occurred toward
joy photos, differing from contempt smile photos (p< .001).
For the expression of contempt smiles, it was also shown that
the facial expressions toward the two types of photos (joy
smiles, contempt smiles) differed, 2(df = 1) = 4.46, p< .05.
The post hoc Wilcoxon rank-order comparisons showed that
contempt was displayed most frequently toward contempt
photos, differing from joy displays (p< .05).
Differences in level of gelotophobia in overall frequencies of
facial displays. The frequency of all facial responses over the
16 photos ranged between 0 and 14 (M = 4.46, SD = 2.54),
implying that some participants did not show any displays of
DDs or contempt smiles, whereas others responded with one
of those facial events to 87.5% of the photos. More specifi-
cally, the occurrence of DDs over all 16 photos ranged from
0 to 7 (M = 1.58, SD = 2.02), and contempt ranged from 0
to 8 (M = 2.58, SD = 1.94). No photo elicited more than one
facial response. A repeated-measures ANOVA was computed
to reveal general differences in the frequency of joy and con-
tempt shown by the two groups (see Figure 1).

Group differences in facial expressions displays to differ-
ent types of smiles. Next, it was evaluated whether the two
groups differed in the facial expressions shown toward one
type of emotion displayed in the photos. 2 tests comparing
the frequency of occurrence of two types of facial responses
(DD, contempt smile) with two types of smiles (joy and
contempt) presented in photos were computed. First, the no
fear group's frequency of mimicked DD responses toward
joy photos was higher than that in the gelotophobia group,
in line with H3, 2(df = 1) = 23.27, p< .001. For joy smiles
toward photos entailing contempt, the assumption of having
at least five cases in each cell was violated. Second, the gelo-
tophobes differed from the no fear group in the frequency of
showing contempt in response to the joy smile photos, with
gelotophobes showing higher numbers of contempt smiles,
in line with H4, 2(df = 1) = 10.27, p< .001. In respect to
contempt smiles toward contempt photos, the gelotophobes
did not differ from the no fear group in the frequency of
responses, 2(df = 1) = 0.32, p = .571 (disconfirming H5).
Convergence of subjective and objective data.The conver-
gence between verbal emotion ratings and facial responses
was examined by Spearman's rank-order correlations.
Higher ratings of joy toward joy photos went along with
more intense DDs (r = .54, p< .01). Also, higher joy ratings
toward joy photos went along with less expressed contempt
(r = -.44, p< .01). Contempt ratings toward joy photos went
along with less intense responses of DDs (r = -.37, p< .01)
and more expressed contempt (r = .19, p = .19), showing
moderate convergence of objective and subjective data.
Participants' mood. Means and standard deviations of PA and
NA are reported in Table 2. The descriptive statistics of the
state scales indicated high skewness values for NA (i.e., gen-
erally low levels of NA were reported). To analyze the mood
changes in the two groups, a repeated-measures ANOVA for
PA was computed, as well as a Friedman two-way ANOVA
for NA, to account for the violated normality assumptions.
For PA, the two groups (gelotophobia vs. no fear) differed,
F(1, 48) = 9.82, p< .01, p
2 = .17, with the gelotophobes
being lower in PA than the no fear group. The interaction
showed that the no fear group increased in PA, while the
gelotophobes decreased, in line with H6, F(1, 48) = 6.48, p<
.05, p
2 = .12. The Friedman ANOVA with the Wilcoxon
rank-order comparisons for NA showed a significant overall
effect, 2(df = 1) = 11.91, p< .001; NA differed from pre to
post (T = 195.50, p< .05).Also, the two groups differed in the
pre- and post-measures (U = 531.00, p< .05), but no interac-
tion occurred. As expected, looking at the photos did not lift
PA of the gelotophobes, but lifted PA in no fear individuals
(confirming H6). NA was higher in the gelotophobes to start
with, but decreased from pre to post the rating task.
To test whether the increase in PA was mediated by the
amountoffaciallyexpressedjoy,arepeated-measuresANCOVA
was computed for PA (with the frequency of expressed DDs as
covariate). Results indicated that the frequency of expressed
joy, indeed, mediated PA, as the significant results disap-
peared for the interaction of Gelotophobia group ×

Discussion
As in Study 1, gelotophobes rated joy displays more con-
temptuous compared to the no fear group (in line with H1b).
Both groups rated the contempt photos as contemptuous.
Also, the contempt photos contained tendentially more per-
ceived joy for the gelotophobes than the no fear group (in
line with H2b); though this finding needs to be treated with
caution (i.e., failed to reach statistical significance in Study 1).
Overall, the results for the emotion ratings were replicated in
Study 2, but the findings were also extended to the effect of
the rating task on the mood, as well as the spontaneous facial
responses to the photos. Although the gelotophobes were
habitually lower in PA and higher in NA compared to indi-
viduals with no fear (supporting the earlier findings of gelo-
tophobes being habitually lower in joy), these scores did not
influence the ratings.
In line with the expectations, the gelotophobes expressed
less joy smiles toward joy photos, compared to the no fear
group (H3). This might be due to the elicitation of shame
through (attributed) ridicule or contempt. According to
Tomkins (1969), one of the facial response pattern in shame
is the
. . . frozen face, in which the entire facial musculature is kept
under sufficient tight control, so that shame, along with all other
affects is interfered with at the site of expressivity. This may be
a chronic of a transient defense against shame and other affects.
(p. 365)
The generally lower levels of facial responses are sup-
portive of Tomkins's (1969) claim that individuals with an
inclination to shame may display a "frozen face." Perhaps
the reduced facial expressivity of joy generalizes for geloto-
phobes over situations, in line with the findings of Papousek
and colleagues (2009) who reported that gelotophobia pre-
dicted the control over the expression of emotions.
Furthermore, the gelotophobes showed more contempt
toward joy photos, compared to the no fear group (H4). This
implies that they attribute negative emotions to facially dis-
played joy.
As laughter and smiling are known to be contagious (e.g.,
Bourgeois & Hess, 2008), it was expected that looking at the
photos would induce state PA in participants with no fear.
Indeed, the engagement with the smiling and laughter photos
lifted the PA of participants with no fear, but did not lift the PA
of the gelotophobes, confirming H6 and replicating the find-
ings of former studies (Ruch et al., 2009). The present study
suggests that this effect is mediated through the expressed
Hofmann et al. 9
enjoyment, as the mood changes differed when they were
controlled for the frequency of expressed DDs. Likewise, a
study by Papousek and colleagues (2009) showed that when
gelotophobes are exposed to the affective states of others,
they show less emotional contagion to cheerful stimuli but a
high degree of contagion to negative stimuli, in line with the
PA not increasing in the gelotophobia group. Moreover, dif-
ferences also occurred for NA: The gelotophobes' NA was
higher pre and post the rating task compared to individuals
with no fear.
General Discussion
The aim of the present research was to investigate how gelo-
tophobia biases the perception of and responses to facially
displayed joy and contempt. Gelotophobes perceive joy dis-
plays to contain more contempt compared with individuals
with no fear (next to joy) and show more frequent contempt
displays toward such displays than individuals with no fear
of being laughed at. Also, gelotophobes express less joy
toward joy displays and rate the joy lower compared with
individuals with no fear. Next, we discuss the potential
impact of those findings in the broader contexts of (a) the
emotional experience of gelotophobes, (b) the potential
impact of the bias on social interactions, (c) supporting evi-
dence for the bias from broad personality traits (extraversion
and neuroticism), and (d) possible implications on well-
being and social support of the tendency of gelotophobes to
express less joy compared with individuals with no fear.
First, the present findings lead to more insight into the
emotional life of gelotophobes. While shame, fear, and (low)
joy seem to be the emotions forming the core of the experi-
ence of fearful individuals (see Ruch et al., 2014), contempt
seems to be the emotion assigned to the "offenders" (i.e., the
persons smiling and laughing). This is in line with the
descriptions of emotion clusters, which bring contempt, ridi-
cule, and shame together. The contemptuous person ridicules
the person who is disliked, and the ridicule goes along with
the laughter of the contemptuous person, which, in turn, elic-
its shame in the victim (e.g., Tomkins, 1969; "the laugh
becomes a vehicle of contempt," p. 367). Interestingly,
Tomkins (1969) stated in his work on shame that this emotion
might be accompanied by different expressive behaviors: " . .
. another specific anti-shame posture is the use of the con-
tempt response, either as a transient or chronic posture with
which to combat one's own readiness to feel ashamed" (p.
365). This "anti-shame expression" in the form of contempt
might explain the frequent occurrence of contempt expressed
by gelotophobes and they might show contempt smiles to
counteract the emergence and expression of shame (which
they are very sensitive too). This is of particular importance,
as the induction of shame might be due to a misinterpretation,
as gelotophobes have been shown to misinterpret laughter-
related situations, auditory laughter, as well as ridicule and
teasing situations (Ruch et al., 2014). Therefore, it might be
that shame is induced in gelotophobes by making them feel
ridiculed although no ridicule was intended. While different
authors have stated that "mutual laughter" can release feel-
ings of shame by putting the shameful situation in perspec-
tive and find some irony in it (e.g., Retzinger, 1987), it is
hypothesized from the current results that gelotophobes
could not interpret these signals of mutual smiling and laugh-
ter as benevolent, as the effect of misjudgment is already
apparent in context-free photos. Therefore, mutual laughter
would not be perceived as relieving, as the underlying
misperception is not solved (laughter is seen as a social rejec-
tion cue; see also Papousek et al., 2014). In this case, it would
be necessary to train gelotophobes to re-evaluate laughter, its
elicitors, and the underlying feeling state of the laughing per-
son first.
Second, the findings help generate new hypotheses on the
difficulties gelotophobes experience in social interactions.
Misperceiving joy as contemptuous and responding with
more contempt, in general, might lead to a feedback loop of
misunderstanding, as not only the gelotophobe will misper-
ceive the "offender" but also the "offender" will be signaled
contempt on the behalf of the gelotophobe. This might leave
both parties with perceived contempt of the other. Still, this
might depend on relationship closeness too. Kashdan and
Roberts (2006) showed that for highly socially anxious indi-
viduals, small talk interactions lead to greater NA compared
with low socially anxious, whereas no difference was found
for interactions in intimate relationships. This suggests that
also for gelotophobes, intimacy might foster the mutual
understanding of the partners and might help overcoming
unusual responses.
Third, the present results lead to the hypothesis that gelo-
tophobes apply specific expressions when dealing with joy
and contempt, by generally showing more contempt and less
joy. This is also interesting in the context of the findings of
Fok et al. (2008), as they reported that extraverts lessen the
control over expressing happiness, but increase the control
over disgust, surprise, and contempt. They argued that in dis-
tant relationship, the display of emotions that communicate
discomfort or disapproval with the current situation may be
perceived as impolite. Also, extraverts think that it is more
appropriate to express contempt and disgust in close rela-
tionships, because they are more competent in their ability to
repair and maintain relationships (e.g., Watson, Clark,
McIntyre, & Hamaker, 1992). Gelotophobes generally report
being (neurotic) introverts; therefore, the findings for intro-
version might also apply to gelotophobic individuals.
Gelotophobes may lack competences to repair and maintain
relationships, but at the same time express contempt more
often toward joy and contempt than individuals without gel-
otophobia. This is likely to lead to misunderstandings in
social interactions.
For introverts, Fok and colleagues (2008) stated that they are
less socially responsive and less likely to modulate their emotion
expression (even when uncomfortable with the public attention).
This may partially explain the higher number of expressed con-
tempt in gelotophobes compared with individuals with no
10 SAGE Open
fear. Still, in the present studies, participants were unob-
served and the results cannot solely be explained by these
findings (unless the participants imagined a relationship with
the individuals shown in the photos). Furthermore, geloto-
phobes also report higher scores in neuroticism than indi-
viduals with no fear (see Ruch et al., 2014, for a review).
Kashdan (2002) showed that individuals high in neuroticism
are more socially anxious and hypothesized that they would
express their emotions less often to avoid unwelcome atten-
tion of others. For gelotophobes, this may be specific to
avoiding the laughter of others.
Fourth, it has been postulated that genuine displays of
positive emotions and mimicry elicit positive responses in
other people, thus encouraging social affiliation, improving
the quality of interactions, and making social resources avail-
able for coping with adversity (Fredrickson, 1998; Johnston
et al., 2010; Papa & Bonanno, 2008). Furthermore, positive
expressions are used on an everyday basis, for example,
when individuals respond with polite smiles to social part-
ners, leading to advantages in cooperation and communica-
tion. If gelotophobes fail to mimic those expressions and
empathize with their meaning, they will be likely to lose out
on social reinforcement and cooperation, leading to less
social affiliation and less social resources (as well as provid-
ing less of those resources to others). Consequently, the lack
of social support might be a factor that makes gelotophobes
even more vulnerable to misinterpreting people's behavior
and situations, as they get less help in re-evaluating situa-
tions, talking about experiences, and thereby less getting
external validation on their (mis-)perceptions. Furthermore,
DDs influence well-being by fostering self-regulation and
helping reduce the physiological and emotional conse-
quences of NA (Fredrickson, 1998). This intrapersonal func-
tion of smiling will also receive less importance in
gelotophobes as they generally display less joy facially.
The current study has several limitations. First and fore-
most, the stimuli utilized for the current investigation only
included a small (and uneven) number of joy and contempt dis-
plays, as well as other smiles and posed expressions. The
choice of displays was based on theoretical notions and their
described putative facial expressions. Thus, the chosen dis-
plays were a good starting point to investigate individual differ-
ences in the perception of smiling and laughter, but further
empirical validation of the smiles is needed.At best, an empiri-
cally validated classification of smiles and laughs would be used
for such an investigation, but to date, no such classification is
available. Also, the stimuli were not gender balanced. Thus, it
was impossible to investigate effects of gender of the posing per-
son and other variables (such as attractiveness of the poser) on
the perception of the displays. Although we assume that geloto-
phobia biases the smiling and laughter perception independent of
the gender and attractiveness of the poser, future studies might
investigate possible influential poser features. Furthermore, the
small number of stimuli did not allow for a complete random-
ization of the stimuli. This might be relevant, as it has been
shown that gelotophobes show overreactions to fear-inducing
stimuli (see Ruch et al., 2014), and it is possible that seeing a
joyful face at the beginning of the series induced NA, which
was carried over to the subsequent photos. Thus, a replication
of the results with more stimuli and a complete randomization
would be necessary.
Second, the "Smiling Face May Hide an Evil Mind
Paradigm" needs to be more closely evaluated, as the emotion
ratings do not allow for a judgment of the underlying feeling
state of the presenter, as participants were explicitly asked to
rate the facial displays. At best, the paradigm would be uti-
lized with additional questions. Third, it is still unanswered
whether gelotophobes misperceive joyful and contemptuous
faces because of certain features of the displays. Therefore,
features making smiles and laughs malicious need to be
investigated by specifically asking participants what made
the display contemptuous. Fourth, while the study by Ruch et
al. (2009) focused on auditory presentation, this study has
focused on visual presentation. Future studies should com-
bine the two modes and investigate the differential effects of
both, as well as their combination. Furthermore, physiologi-
cal measures, that is, of tension could give further indications
on the gelotophobes' responses to these displays. This might
help shed light on the question why gelotophobes are prone to
believing that "a joyful face may hide an evil mind."
To conclude, this is the first study investigating geloto-
phobia and emotions assigned to potential "offenders" dis-
playing smiling and laughter. Although these results need
further specification and replication, they might give an
insight into why gelotophobes find dealing with smiling and
laughter aversive (as they see them as rather contemptuous
and less joyful compared with individuals with no fear). It is
important to investigate and understand such mechanisms, as
the expression of smiling and laughter serves important
social functions beyond the communication of positive emo-
tions. Also, the expression of contempt has an important pre-
diction value in relationship processes (see Gottman,
Levenson, & Woodin, 2001). If gelotophobes misperceive
displays of joy and contempt, they may experience difficul-
ties in social interactions and it needs to be assessed how this
misperception can be addressed in training programs, maybe
by applying cognitive reattribution strategies.

Notes
1. Based on the works of Bänninger-Huber (1996) and Ekman
(1985), we utilized smile types with explicit descriptions of
their putative facial expressions in Action Unit (AU) codes (in
the Facial Action Coding System, FACS; Ekman, Friesen, &
Hager, 2002). Joy smile, Duchenne display (DD): symmetric
contraction of the zygomatic major muscle (AU12) and the
outer part of the orbicularis oculi muscle (AU6). The DD
has been related to the experience of joy, amusement, and
the funniness of jokes (Ekman, Davidson, & Friesen, 1990;
Messinger, Cassel, Acosta, Ambadar, & Cohn, 2008; Ruch,
2005). The Duchenne laugh consists of an open-mouth DD
plus an audible, laughter-related vocalization (Ruch & Ekman,
2001). Contempt smile: unilateral action of the buccinator
muscle (AU14; Ekman & Heider, 1988; Matsumoto, 2004).
Although the universality of the contempt expression has been
questioned (e.g., Russell, 1991; Wagner, 2000), there is a body
of research suggesting that it is universally recognized (e.g.,
Keltner & Haidt, 1999), though not always correctly verbally
labeled (see Rosenberg & Ekman, 1995). Phony smile: sole
contraction of AU12 (Ekman, 1985). Masking smiles (actually
a family of smiles): the combination of markers of negative
emotions and AU12 (Ekman, 1985; Ekman & Friesen, 1982).
Chaplin smile: sharp upward pulling of the lips due to the con-
traction of the caninus muscle (AU13).
2. Although comprehensive validations of smiling and laughter
classifications are still outstanding, smiling and laughter types
have been described according to their facial expression, offer-
ing a starting point to investigate the influence of gelotophobia
on smiling and laughter perception.
3. AU1 = Inner Brow Raiser. AU2 = Outer Brow Raiser. AU4 =
Brow Lowerer. AU5 = Upper Lid Raiser. AU6 = Cheek Raiser.
AU7 = Lids Tight. AU9 = Nose Wrinkle. AU12 = Lip Corner
Puller. AU14 = Dimpler. AU17 = Chin Raiser. AU20 = Lip
Stretch. AU24 = Lip Presser. AU25 = Lips Part. AU26 = Jaw
Drop. L, R = left, right side of the face.
4. Analyses of the distractor items indicated no differences between
individuals with or without gelotophobia (all ns), or interaction
between the Emotion ratings × Gelotophobia group, in line with
our predictions (all ns). The surprise photo obtained highest rat-
ings on surprise, which was rated more intense than all other
emotions (p< .001). The happy­surprise emotion blend was
rated most intensely as joyful and surprise, which did not differ
from each other but from all other emotion ratings (p< .001).
For the onset of fear, the ratings above the cut-off did not differ
(p = .055). For the concentration, the highest ratings (anger, con-
tempt) did not differ from each other but from all other emotions
(p< .001). For the neutral photos, a repeated-measures ANOVA
showed that the emotion ratings differed, F
emotion
(2, 148) = 30.08,
p< .001, p
2 = .29: Highest ratings were obtained in sadness (no
fear group: M = 2.63, SD = 1.55; gelotophobes: M = 2.63, SD
= 1.56), followed by contempt (no fear group: M = 2.38, SD =
1.67; gelotophobes: M = 2.60, SD = 1.73) and finally fear (no
fear group: M = 2.22, SD = 1.39; gelotophobes: M = 2.32, SD
= 1.21), F
contrasts
(1, 74) > 13.65, p< .001, p
2 > .16. The groups
(fear, no fear) did not differ, F(1, 80) = 0.01, p = .914, and no
interaction occurred, F(3, 240) = 0.21, p = .909.
5. Repeating the analyses by controlling for positive affect (PA)
and negative affect (NA) in a repeated-measures ANCOVA
(gelotophobia group as a factor, the emotion ratings as repeated
measures, intensity of emotion as a dependent variable, and PA
and NAas covariates) showed that neither trait had a significant
influence on the ratings (p = .132 and p = .274, respectively).
6. Too little masking smiles occurred for statistical analyses.
