Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the correlation between Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
II (APACHE II) score and plasma concentrations of copeptin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and
procalcitonin in patients with sepsis.
Methods: Patients with sepsis were prospectively enrolled. APACHE II scores were determined
during the first 24 h after admission to the intensive care unit. Plasma copeptin, CRP and
procalcitonin were quantified at admission, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Survival at 28 days after admission
was recorded.
Results: APACHE II score was significantly positively correlated with plasma copeptin, CRP and
procalcitonin concentrations. Survivors (n ¼ 15) had significantly lower APACHE II scores and
copeptin, CRP and procalcitonin concentrations than nonsurvivors (n ¼ 26). APACHE II score,
copeptin at 72 h, CRP at 48 h and procalcitonin at 24 h were independent risk factors for death.
Conclusion: Plasma copeptin, CRP and procalcitonin concentrations were positively correlated
with APACHE II score in patients with sepsis, and reflected disease severity.

therefore important for predicting pro-
gnosis, preventing complications and redu-
cing mortality. The Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)
is the standard method for evaluating
sepsis,2 but other diagnostic and prognostic
biomarkers are being investigated.
Copeptin, a short peptide derived from
a preprohormone consisting of vasopressin,
neurophysin II and copeptin, is one possible
sepsis biomarker. Vasopressin is released on
exposure to stress such as severe infection
and sepsis, but its small molecular size
and short half-life make detection impracti-
cal.3 Copeptin is a useful surrogate for
vasopressin because it is stable in plasma
and is released in similar quantities.4 Plasma
copeptin concentrations were found to be
significantly higher in patients with septic
shock than in healthy control subjects
(59­1572 pmol/l vs 0.3­18 pmol/l).5
C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-
phase protein synthesized by the liver in
response to inflammation. Normal plasma
CRP concentrations (<8 mg/l) rise signifi-
cantly during the early phase of sepsis.6
Procalcitonin is a 116 amino acid precursor
of calcitonin. Plasma procalcitonin concen-
trations are below the limits of detection in
healthy individuals (0.5 ng/ml), and can
rise to 1000 ng/ml in severe bacterial infec-
tion or sepsis.7 Procalcitonin has a half-life
of 15­20 h in the blood,8 and concentrations
are correlated with severity of sepsis in
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).9
The aim of this study was to determine
plasma concentrations of copeptin, CRP and
procalcitonin in patients with sepsis, and
evaluate their correlations with APACHE II
scores. The diagnostic and prognostic value
of these biomarkers is discussed.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective study included patients
with sepsis who were treated in the ICU of
Dalian Medical University First Hospital,
Dalian, Liaoning, China between May 2012
and December 2012. Sepsis was diagnosed
according to guidelines of the Surviving
Sepsis Campaign 2012.10 Exclusion criteria
were: (i) cardiovascular disease (e.g. acute
coronary syndrome, rheumatic heart dis-
ease, congenital heart disease); (ii) multiple
trauma with injury severity score >15; (iii)
heart failure; (iv) death within 72 h of
admission; (v) incomplete clinical data.
This study was approved by the ethics
committee of DaLian Medical University
First Hospital, and written informed con-
sent was obtained from each patient or their
next-of-kin.
Data collection
Venous blood (10 ml) was collected on admis-
sion to ICU, and at 24h, 48h and 72h after
admission. Uncoagulated blood was centri-
fuged at 2500g for 15min at ­4C and the
resulting plasma was analysed. Copeptin,
CRP and procalcitonin were quantified
using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
kits (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame,
CA, USA; Roche, Basel, Switzerland; and
BRAHMS Diagostica GmbH, Germany,
respectively), according to the manufacturers'
instructions. APACHE II scores were
assigned, based on the most pessimistic clin-
ical and laboratory data obtained during the
first 24h following admission. Patients were
followed-up for 28 days after admission, and
the 28-day mortality rate was calculated.
Statistical analyses
Continuous data were expressed as
meanÆ SD and compared using Kruskal­
Wallis or Mann­Whitney U-test. Categorical
data were expressed as n (%) and compared
using 2-test. Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient was used to evaluate associa-
tions between APACHE II score and
plasma concentrations of copeptin, CRP
Jiang et al. 189
and procalcitonin. Prognostic factors were
analysed using multivariate logistic regres-
sion analysis. Receiver operating characteris-
tic (ROC) curves of copeptin, CRP and
procalcitonin were generated and the area
under the curve (AUC) was calculated. All
statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included 41 patients (25 male/16
female; mean age 62.07 Æ 11.89 years, range
49­74 years).
Mortality rates were 11.1% (1/9), 62.5%
(5/8), and 83.3% (20/24) for patients with
APACHE II scores 15, 15 to 25, and !25,
respectively (P < 0.05). The mean APACHE
II score was significantly higher in patients
who died within 28 days of admission
(n ¼ 26) compared with survivors (n ¼ 15;
25.54 Æ 9.87 vs 10.63 Æ 6.18; P < 0.01).
There were significant positive correl-
ations between APACHE II score and
plasma copeptin, CRP and procalcitonin
concentrations at all timepoints (Table 1).
Data regarding plasma concentrations of
copeptin, CRP and procalcitonin in patients
stratified according to APACHE II scores
are given in Table 2. Concentrations of
copeptin and procalcitonin were signifi-
cantly higher in patients with APACHE II
scores !25 than those with scores <25 ( 15
or 15­25) at all timepoints (P < 0.05 for each
comparison). CRP concentrations were sig-
nificantly higher in patients with APACHE
II scores !25 than those with scores <25
( 15 or 15­25) at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after
admission (P < 0.05 for each comparison).
Plasma concentrations of copeptin, CRP
and procalcitonin were significantly higher
in patients who died within 28 days of
admission compared with survivors
(P < 0.05, Table 3).
Significant risk factors for death in
patients with sepsis were APACHE II
score (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, 95% confidence
intervals [CI] 1.054, 1.128), copeptin at 72 h
(OR 1.508, 95% CI 1.161, 1.958), CRP at
48 h (OR 1.009, 95% CI 1.003, 1.015), and
procalcitonin at 24 h (OR 1.085, 95% CI
1.036, 1.108). The AUC of the ROC curves
were 0.951, 0.837 and 0.811 for copeptin at
72 h, procalcitonin at 24 h and CRP at 48 h,
respectively (P < 0.05; Figure 1).
Discussion
Plasma copeptin, CRP and procalcitonin
concentrations were positively correlated
with APACHE II score in patients with
sepsis, in the present study. These three

biomarkers reflected disease severity and
could be used to predict outcome.
Vasopressin is released by the hypothal-
amic­pituitary­adrenal axis that also pro-
duces adrenocorticotropic hormone and
cortisol. Serum cortisol concentrations
have been shown to reflect an individual's
stress levels and can be used to predict the
outcome of patients with sepsis or pneumo-
nia.11 Copeptin concentrations provide a
more accurate reflection of stress severity
than cortisol levels.12
Copeptin concentration can independ-
ently predict the survival of critically ill
patients with haemorrhagic and septic
shock,13 and is significantly elevated in
patients with lower respiratory tract infec-
tions compared with healthy controls.14
Additionally, copeptin concentration has
been shown to be associated with the
severity of pneumonia, as based on a pneu-
monia severity index. Plasma copeptin
concentrations increased significantly with
higher APACHE II scores in the present
study, reflecting the severity of sepsis.
In addition, plasma copeptin concentrations
were significantly higher in patients who
died within 28 days of admission than in
patients who survived. In accordance
with previous findings,8,13,15­18 our study
showed that plasma copeptin could be used
to evaluate the severity of sepsis. In add-
ition, the present finding that elevated
copeptin concentration at 72 h after admis-
sion was associated with increased mortality
suggests that this parameter could be used to
predict sepsis-related patient death.
Elevated CRP concentrations represent
an acute-phase response to acute tissue
injuries such as those produced by surgery,
infection or acute inflammation, and signify
the body's attempt to neutralize the in-
flammatory agent and promote healing of
the injured tissue.18,19 Plasma CRP can

reach 1000-fold normal concentrations
during the acute-phase response,20 and
CRP has therefore been used to monitor
disease activity in conditions including
sepsis. Plasma CRP concentrations were
positively correlated with APACHE II
scores and reflected the severity of sepsis in
the present study, in accordance with the
findings of others.21
Animal studies indicate that procalcito-
nin plays a pathophysiological role in the
development of severe sepsis and is asso-
ciated with mortality. Treatment with pro-
calcitonin was shown to double the death
rate in animals,21 whereas injection with
an antiprocalcitonin antibody increased
the survival of animals with sepsis.21­24
Procalcitonin is an accurate biomarker
for severe infection,25,26 and for the diagno-
sis of bacterial sepsis and bacteraemia.27
Procalcitonin concentration has also been
used to guide the empirical antibiotic treat-
ment of sepsis patients,28 and, in accordance
with our findings, is known to reflect
the severity of infection as well as
having prognostic implications for crit-
ically ill patients.29 An advantage of
procalcitonin over other biomarkers is that
its production is not significantly affected by
nonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs.30­32
Our study has several limitations. The
sample size was small and caution should
be used when interpreting the results. In

(PTC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in predicting survival of patients with sepsis. Times shown are after

addition, copeptin concentrations at 72 h
after admission were a less-useful predictive
factor for death compared with procalcito-
nin at 24 h, since patients may have already
died by 72 h after admission.
In conclusion, plasma copeptin, CRP and
procalcitonin concentrations were positively
correlated with APACHE II score in
patients with sepsis, and therefore reflected
disease severity. APACHE II score, copep-
tin concentration at 72 h, CRP concentra-
tion at 48 h and procalcitonin concentration
at 24 h were independent risk factors for
death in patients with sepsis.
