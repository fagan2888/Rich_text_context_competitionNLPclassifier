Commentary
Digital companion species and eating
data: Implications for theorising digital
data­human assemblages
Deborah Lupton
Abstract
This commentary is an attempt to begin to identify and think through some of the ways in which sociocultural theory
may contribute to understandings of the relationship between humans and digital data. I develop an argument that rests
largely on the work of two scholars in the field of science and technology studies: Donna Haraway and Annemarie Mol.
Both authors emphasised materiality and multiple ontologies in their writing. I argue that these concepts have much to
offer critical data studies. I employ the tropes of companion species, drawn from Haraway, and eating data, from Mol, and
demonstrate how these may be employed to theorise digital data­human assemblages.

Introduction
While an intense interest in digital data in popular
and research cultures is now evident, we still do not
know enough about how people interact with, make
sense of and use the digital data that they generate.
A developing body of literature in critical data stu-
dies has begun to focus on elements of these prac-
tices. Sociologists and anthropologists have pointed
to the highly contextual aspects that shape human-
data encounters, including their specificities and con-
tingencies (for example, Nafus, 2014; Taylor et al.,
2014). Other researchers have identified a growing
concern among citizens about data privacy and secur-
ity (Madden and Rainie, 2015; Pew Research Center,
2014). Everyday data practices remain under-
theorised, however: particularly in relation to how
people conceptualise, gain purchase on and perform
the data assemblages that are generated by and for
them. In this commentary, in attempting to identify
and think through some of the ways in which socio-
cultural theory may contribute to understandings of
data practices, I develop an argument that rests lar-
gely on the work of two scholars in the field of sci-
ence and technology studies: Donna Haraway and
Annemarie Mol.
Haraway: Digital assemblages
as companion species
I begin with Haraway, as the legacy of her writing
underpins some of Mol's work. Haraway's work has
often attempted `to find descriptive language that
names emergent ontologies' (Haraway, 2015: np).
I use her ideas here in the spirit of developing new
terms and concepts to describe people's encounters
with digital data. Haraway emphasises that humans
cannot be separated from nonhumans conceptually,
as we are constantly interacting with other animals
and material objects as we go about our daily lives.
Her writings on the figure of the cyborg (for example,
Bhavnani and Haraway, 1994; Haraway, 1991, 1995)
have been influential in conceptualising human and
computer technological encounters. In this work,
Haraway draws attention to the idea that human

ontologies must be understood as multiple and dynamic
rather than fixed and essential, as blurring boundaries
between nature and culture, human and nonhuman,
self and other. She contends that actors, whether
human or nonhuman, are never pre-established;
rather they emerge through relational encounters
(Bhavnani and Haraway, 1994). The cyborg metaphor
encapsulates this idea, not solely in relation to human­
technology assemblages, but to any interaction of
humans with nonhumans.
This perspective already provides a basis for think-
ing through the emergent ontologies of digital data
assemblages. Haraway's musings on human and non-
human animal interactions (Haraway, 2003, 2008,
2015) also have resonance for how we might under-
stand these assemblages. Haraway uses the term `com-
panion species' to describe the relationships that the
human species has not only with other animal species
but also with technologies. Humans are companion
species with the nonhumans alongside which they live
and engage, each species learning from and influencing
the other, co-evolving. Haraway (2015) refers to com-
panion species as `post-cyborg entities', acknowledging
the development of her thinking since her original
cyborg exegesis.
This trope of companion species may be taken up to
think about the ways in which humans generate,
materialise and engage with digital data. Thrift (2014)
has described the new `hybrid beings' that are com-
prised of digital data and human flesh. Adopting
Haraway's companion species trope allows for the
extension of this idea by acknowledging the liveliness
of digital data and the relational nature of our inter-
actions with these data. Haraway has commented in a
lecture that she has learned
through my own inhabiting of the figure of the cyborg
about the non-anthropomorphic agency and the liveli-
ness of artifacts. The kind of sociality that joins
humans and machines is a sociality that constitutes
both, so if there is some kind of liveliness going on
here it is both human and non-human. Who humans
are ontologically is constituted out of that relationality.
(Haraway, 2015: np)
This observation goes to the heart of how we might
begin to theorise the liveliness of digital data in the
context of our own vitality, highlighting the relational-
ity and sociality that connect them.
These aspects of digital data assemblages are per-
haps becoming even more pronounced as the Internet
of Things develops and humans become just one node
in a network of software, digital data repositories and
smart objects that configure and exchange digital
data with each other. Humans move around in
data-saturated environments and can wear personalised
data-generating devices on their bodies; including not
only their smartphones but objects such as sensor-
embedded wristbands, clothing or watches. The devices
that we carry with us literally are our companions: in
the case of smartphones regularly touched, fiddled with
and looked at throughout the day. In distinction from
previous technological prostheses, mobile and wearable
devices are also invested with and send out continuous
flows of personal information. They have become the
repositories of users' communications with others, geo-
location information, personal images, biometric infor-
mation and more. These devices also leak data
outwards, transmitting them to computing cloud
servers.
All this is happening in real-time and continuously,
and in some cases without the users' knowledge or con-
sent. This raises important questions about the security
and privacy of the very intimate information that these
devices generate, transmit and archive (Seneviratne
et al., 2015; Tene and Polonetsky, 2013). Political
issues concerning data ownership are also emerging.
Critical data scholars have identified the asymmetries
in the access of citizens to digital datasets (including
their personal data) and that of government and com-
mercial entities (Andrejevic, 2013; Crawford and
Schultz, 2014).
Like companion species and their humans, digital
data are lively combinations of nature/culture. Digital
data are lively in several ways. They are about life itself
(details about humans and other living species); they
are constantly generated and regenerated as well as
purposed and repurposed as they enter into the digital
knowledge economy; they have potential impacts on
humans' and other species' lives; and their commercial
and research value contributes to livelihoods (Lupton,
2016). Just as digital data assemblages are comprised of
specific information points about people's lives, and
thus learn from people as algorithmic processes
manipulate this personal information, people in turn
learn from the assemblages of which they are a part.
The book or potential dating partner choices that
Amazon and OKCupid offer, the ads that are delivered
to users on Facebook or Twitter, the returns that are
listed from search engine queries or browsing histories,
the information that fitness trackers provide about
users' heart rate or calories burnt each day are all cus-
tomised to the users' digitised behaviours and prefer-
ences. Perusing these data can provide people with
insights about themselves and may structure their
future behaviour.
The companion species trope recognises the inevit-
ability of our relationship with our digital data assem-
blages and the importance of learning to live together
and to learn from each other. It suggests both the
2 Big Data & Society
vitality of these assemblages and also the possibility of
developing a productive relationship, recognising our
mutual dependency. We may begin to think about
our digital data assemblages as companion species
that have a life of their own that is beyond our com-
plete control.
These proliferating digital data companion species,
as they are ceaselessly configured and reconfigured,
emerge beyond our bodies/selves and into the wild of
digital data economies and circulations. They are pur-
posed and repurposed by second and third parties and
even more actors beyond our reckoning as they are
assembled and reassembled. In effect, they are digital
data-human assemblages. Even as our digital data com-
panion species engage in their own lives, they are still
part of us and we remain part of them. We may interact
with them or not; we may be allowed access to them or
not; we may be totally unaware of them or we may
engage in purposeful collection and use of them. They
have implications for our lives in a rapidly growing
array of contexts, from the international travel we are
allowed to undertake to the insurance premiums, job
offers, discounts or credit we are offered (Crawford and
Schultz, 2014; Robinson et al., 2014).
Mol: Eating digital data
The work of Annemarie Mol offers an additional con-
ceptual framework with which to understand digital
data practices at a more detailed level while still retain-
ing the companion species perspective. Mol advocates
for the use of ontologies as a structuring concept in
developing understanding of the relationship between
humans, technologies and knowledge practices. Her
focus is on the performative nature of knowledge, or
how these knowledge assemblages are enacted in prac-
tices and configure different versions of objects, hence
creating different ontologies of these objects.
If digital data­human assemblages are positioned as
objects, Mol's emphasis on multiple and shifting ontol-
ogies is a basis for further theoretical work on lively
data. Mol has developed a framework that incorporates
elements of enquiry that can be mapped onto the topic
of digital data practices. These include the following:
understanding language/discourse and its context and
effects; tracing the development and use of objects of
knowledge as they become objects-in-practice;
acknowledging the dynamic nature of processes and
the `endless tinkering' that is involved in processes;
incorporating awareness of the topologies or sites and
spaces in which phenomena are generated and used;
and finally, directing attention to the lived experiences
or engagements in which practices and objects are
understood and employed (see, for example, Mol,
2015; 2002; Mol and Law, 2004).
If this approach is applied to digital data practices
and their configurations, then focusing attention on the
language that is employed to describe digital data,
viewing digital data as objects that have both discursive
and material effects and that are constantly changing,
recognising the processes of tinkering (experimenting,
adapting) that occur in relation to digital data and the
spaces in which these processes take place are all
important to developing an understanding of the ontol-
ogy of digital data and our relationship with them.
Mol's (2002) concept of `the body multiple' has res-
onances with the Haraway's cyborg ontology. This con-
cept recognises that the human body is comprised of
many different practices, sites and knowledges. While
the body itself is not fragmented or multiple, the phe-
nomena that make sense of it and represent it do so in
many different ways so that the body is lived and
experienced in different modes. Her research on a par-
ticular medical condition, atherosclerosis, demon-
strated that multiple ways of seeing, monitoring and
treating a medical condition (or the different actor net-
works that cohere around and in response to the con-
dition) generate different versions and lived experiences
of this condition (Mol, 2002). So too, the digital data­
human assemblages that are configured by human
users' interactions with digital technologies are different
versions of people's identities and bodies that have
material effects on their ways of living and conceptua-
lising themselves. Part of the work of people's data
practices is negotiating the multiple bodies and selves
that these assemblages represent and configure.
Mol's writings on human subjectivity also have
implications for understanding data practices and inter-
pretations. In her essay entitled `I eat an apple', Mol
points out that once a foodstuff has been swallowed,
the human subject loses control over what happens to
the content of the food in her body as the processes of
digestion take place. As she notes, the body is busily
responding to the food, but the individual herself has
no control over this: `Her actorship is distributed and
her boundaries are neither firm nor fixed' (Mol, 2008:
40). The eating subject is able to choose what food she
decides to eat, but after this point, her body decides
how to deal with the components of the food, selecting
certain elements and discarding others.
This raises questions about human agency and sub-
jectivity. In the statement `I eat an apple', comments
Mol, is the agency in the `I' or in the apple? Humans
may grow, harvest and eat apples, but without food-
stuffs such as apples, humans would not exist.
Furthermore, once the apple is chewed and swallowed,
it then becomes part of and absorbed into the eater's
body. It is impossible to determine what is human and
what is apple (Mol, 2008: 30) The eating subject, there-
fore, is semi-permeable, neither completely closed off
Lupton 3
nor completely open to the world. Mol then goes on to
query at what stage the apple becomes part of her, and
whether the category of the human subject might rec-
ognise the apple as `yet another me, a subject in its own
right' (Mol, 2008: 40). Apples themselves have been
shaped by years of cultivation by humans into the
forms in which they now exist. In fact, they may be
viewed as a form of Haraway's companion species.
How then do we draw boundaries around the body/
self and the apple? How is the human subject to be
defined?
To extend Mol's analogy, the human subject may be
conceptualised as both data-ingesting and data-
emitting in an endless cycle of generating data, bringing
the data into the self, generating yet more data. Data
are absorbed into the body/self and then become new
data that flow out of the body/self into the digital data
economy. The data-eating/emitting subject, therefore,
is not closed off but is open to taking in and letting
out digital data. These data become part of the
human subject. Data assemblages also represent the
individual in multiple ways that have different
meanings based on their contexts and uses. Just as
eating an apple has many meanings, depending on the
social, cultural, political, historical and geographical
contexts in which this act takes place, generating and
responding to digital data about oneself are highly con-
tingent acts.
Further questions
Drawing on Haraway and Mol, a new set of questions
are generated when thinking about digital data­human
entanglements. If we adopt Haraway's companion spe-
cies trope, we might ask the following: What are our
affective responses to our digital data companion spe-
cies? Do we love or hate them, or simply feel indifferent
to them? What are the contexts for these responses?
How do we live with our digital data companion spe-
cies? How do they live with us? How do our lives inter-
sect with them? What do they learn from us, and what
do we learn from them? What is the nature of their own
lives as they move around the digital data economy?
How are we influenced by them? How much can we
domesticate or discipline them? How do they domesti-
cate or discipline us? How does each species co-evolve?
Alternatively, using Mol's concepts of the eating
subject, we might wonder: If digital data are never
`raw' but rather are always `cooked' (that is, always
understood and experienced via social and cultural pro-
cesses) (Gitelman and Jackson, 2013), and may indeed
be `rotted' or spoilt in some way (Boellstorff, 2013), can
we also understand them as `eaten' and `digested'?
What happens when we ingest/absorb digital data
about ourselves? Do we recognise some data as `food'
(appropriate for such ingestion) and others as `non-
food' (not appropriate in some way for our use)? Are
some data simply indigestible (our bodies/selves do not
recognise them as us and cannot incorporate them)?
How are the flavours and tastes of digital data experi-
enced, and what differentiates these flavours and tastes?
What role does human agency play in relation to
nonhuman agency in the configuration of the digital
data­human assemblage?
Taken together, these questions have implications
for research focusing on the nature of digital data­
human assemblages and practices. Both Haraway and
Mol emphasised the political implications of their
work. Haraway's cyborg theorising was developed to
explain her socialist feminist principles. In all of her
work she emphasises the importance of paying atten-
tion as critical scholars to the exacerbation of socio-
economic disadvantage and inequalities that may be
outcomes of these relationships. Mol similarly notes
the political nature of technologies. In her `I eat an
apple' essay, for example, she comments about her dis-
taste for Granny Smith apples, once imported from
Chile and therefore associated in her mind with repres-
sive political regimes. As she notes, while she may eat
this type of apple and while it may nourish her body as
other apples do, she is unable to gain sensory pleasure
from it.
Data science writings on Big Data often fail to
acknowledge the political dimensions of digital data.
They do not see how data are always already
`cooked', or how their flavour or digestibility are influ-
enced by their context. Just as `eating apples is vari-
ously situated' (Mol, 2008: 29) in history, geography,
culture, social relations and politics, resulting in differ-
ent flavours and pleasures, so too eating data is con-
textual. Like Haraway's cyborg figuration (see her
interview with Gane, 2006), the digital data­human
assemblage may be viewed both as a product of
global enterprise and capitalism and as representing
possibilities for radical creative and political
possibilities.
Perhaps critical digital data scholars could adopt an
approach from `multispecies ethnographies' (Kirksey
and Helmreich, 2010) in attempting to research the
entanglements of humans and their digital companion
species, by investigating the nature of co-humanity and
the co-evolution of these species, their symbiotic inter-
minglings and becomings and their `mutual ecologies
and coproduced niches' (Kirksey and Helmreich,
2010: 546). Such an approach may serve to bring the
political nature of these entanglements to the fore, by
asking such questions as: What are the mutual ecolo-
gies and coproduced niches of digital data-human
assemblages? Who wields power over how these ecolo-
gies and niches are configured and experienced and who
4 Big Data & Society
are allowed entre
´ e to them? How are digital data prac-
tices and technologies enacted as political modes of
engagement within these ecologies and niches?
