STETTLER, NICOLAS, AREZOO ZOMORRODI, AND
JILL C. POSNER. Predictive value of weight-for-age to
identify overweight children. Obesity. 2007;15:3106­3112.
Objective: The objective was to assess the predictive value
of weight-for-age to identify overweight children and ado-
lescents in the unusual research or public health situations
where height is not available to calculate BMI.
Research Methods and Procedures: Data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2004
were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and pos-
itive and negative predictive values of selected weight-for-
age cut-off points to identify overweight children and ado-
lescents (as defined by BMI 95th percentile). Positive and
negative predictive values are dependent on prevalence and
are reported here for this study population only.
Results: The 50th and 75th weight-for-age percentiles had
good sensitivity (100% and 99.6%, respectively), but poor
positive predictive value (23.7% and 37.0%, respectively),
while the 95th and 97th percentiles had reasonable positive
predictive value (80.3% and 91.5%, respectively), but lim-
ited sensitivity (82.0% and 66.7%, respectively) to identify
overweight subjects. The properties of weight-for-age per-
centiles to identify overweight subjects differed between
sex, age, and race/ethnicity but remain within a relatively
narrow range.
Discussion: No single weight-for-age cut-off point was
found to identify overweight children and adolescents with
acceptable values for all properties and, therefore, cannot be
used in the clinical setting. Furthermore, the positive pre-
dictive values reported here may be lower in populations
with a lower prevalence of obesity. However, in unusual
research or public health situations where height is not
available, such as existing databases, weight-for-age per-
centiles may be useful to target limited resources to groups
more likely to include overweight children and adolescents
than the general population.

Introduction
The definitions of obesity and overweight in children and
adolescents are complex and have resulted in much confu-
sion and controversy (1,2). Ideally, these definitions should
be based on their ability to predict morbidity and mortality
(3). However, in the cases of children and adolescents, this
approach is impractical, as most obesity comorbidities de-
velop later in life. Even though the long-term health con-
sequences of obesity among adolescents have been well
documented (4,5), most definitions are not based on the
predictive value of childhood weight status. The next best
option would be to use measurements of adiposity to clas-
sify children and adolescents as obese, but these measure-
ments either require extensive training (e.g., skinfold thick-
ness) or expensive tools that are sometimes difficult to
transport to the field (e.g., DXA, air displacement plethys-
mography, bioimpedance); thus, although reference data are
available, these are difficult measurements to obtain accu-
rately and are not commonly used. Furthermore, no clear
age- and sex-specific adiposity cut-off points are widely
recognized to define pediatric obesity. Therefore, BMI is
widely recognized as an appropriate tool to screen obese
children and adolescents and to define overweight status, as
a state of excessive weight relative to height, regardless of
body composition (1,2,6,7). Because BMI does not measure
body composition and adiposity, it only is a screening tool
to identify obesity, as defined by excessive adiposity (8).
BMI cut-off points for sex and age have been defined either

using a reference population (U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention definitions) (9) or by extrapolation
of adult BMI values associated with comorbidities (Inter-
national Obesity Task Force definitions) (10).
BMI is easy to obtain, as it requires only measurement of
weight and height, and BMI-for-age percentile curves are
widely available on most current national growth charts.
However, in some unusual circumstances, height is not
routinely measured and, therefore, BMI cannot be calcu-
lated. For example, in most emergency departments, weight
is measured but not height. Similarly, some clinical or
survey databases only include weight. In telephone surveys,
children's weight can easily be measured by parents, but
height measurements are more difficult to obtain. These
situations are problematic for researchers or public health
officials who need to identify obese subjects in large pop-
ulations. Furthermore, reliable height measurement requires
more training (3) than weight measurement and may not be
easily obtained under circumstances where resources are
limited and when the goal is only to identify large numbers
of obese children and adolescents for research or public
health purposes. In these circumstances where height is not
available, the question arises of whether weight-for-age
cut-off points can be used to predict the likelihood of
identifying overweight pediatric subjects.
Low weight-for-age is a reasonable assessment of under-
nutrition, as children with either acute (low weight-for-
height) or chronic (low height-for-age) under-nutrition are
likely to have a low weight-for-age. However, acute and
chronic under-nutrition cannot be differentiated by weight-
for-age alone and assessments of height-for-age and weight-
for-height are needed to distinguish these two conditions.
Lower percentile weight-for-age cut-off points have been
recommended by the World Health Organization to iden-
tify under-nutrition in some situations (7). However, less
is known about the predictive value of weight-for-age at
the upper end of the spectrum. Many, but not all, over-
weight children are tall for their age because of advanced
maturity and puberty; and in countries in nutritional
transition, overweight is actually associated with short
stature for age (11).
The primary aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the
predictive value of weight-for-age to identify population
subgroups with large numbers of overweight children and
adolescents (as defined by a BMI 95th percentile) (9)
using a representative sample of U.S. children and adoles-
cents. Sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and
negative predictive values of selected weight-for-age per-
centile cut-off points, were determined. The secondary aim
was to assess if the predictive value of these cut-off points
differed between sex, age, and race/ethnicity. The aim of
this study was not to assess if weight-for-age cut-off points
could replace BMI-for-age as a screening tool for obesity, as
it is widely recognized that BMI-for-age would perform
better than weight-for-age to assess adiposity, but rather to
provide researchers and public health professionals with
screening tools to identify subpopulations likely to contain
a high proportion of overweight children and adolescents
(with high BMI), in situations where height measurement is
not available. Therefore, we chose to use the Centers for
Disease Control definition of overweight, based on BMI,
rather than a definition of obesity based on measurements of
adiposity for primary analyses. In secondary analyses, how-
ever, the predictive values of weight-for-age cut-off points
for excess subcutaneous adiposity were also calculated.

Research Methods and Procedures
Cross-sectional data from the most recent National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)1
from 1999 to 2004 were used (12). Briefly, NHANES is
a continuous survey that uses a complex sampling process
to generate data representative of the entire U.S. non-
institutionalized population. Children and adolescents, as
well as black and Mexican-American subjects, are over-
sampled to enable analyses among these population sub-
groups.
From 1999 to 2004, weight, height, triceps skinfold,
subscapular skinfold, age, sex, and race/ethnicity were as-
sessed in 12,382 children and adolescents between the
ages of 2 and 19 years using standardized protocols and
equipment. For the present study, the numbers of subjects
by sex, age groups, and racial/ethnic groups are reported in
Table 1. Weight was measured using a Toledo digital scale
(Mettler-Toledo, Inc., Columbus, OH) with subjects wear-
ing only underwear, disposable paper gowns, and foam
slippers. Standing height was measured with a fixed Seca
electronic stadiometer (Seca GmbH & Co., Hamburg, Ger-
many) with a vertical backboard and a moveable headboard
(12). Skinfold thickness was measured using a Holtain
skinfold caliper (Holtain, Crymych, U.K.). Self-identifica-
tion of ethnicity and race resulted in 4 categories: Mexican-
American, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and
other. Mexican-American, non-Hispanic white, and non-
Hispanic black constituted the three racial/ethnic groups
large enough to conduct subgroup analyses.
All analyses were conducted with Stata 8.2 (StataCorp
LP., College Station, TX) using the survey commands (svy)
to account for non-response and the complex sampling
process used for NHANES. A p value 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. BMI was calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Subjects
with a BMI at or above the sex- and age-specific 95th
percentile of the Centers for Disease Control growth charts
were considered overweight (9). The sum of triceps and
subscapular skinfolds was calculated, and overfat status was
defined as a sum of skinfolds at or above the sex- and
age-specific 95th percentile of a U.S. representative popu-
lation measured before the obesity epidemic (13), similar
to the population used to derive the Centers for Disease
Control BMI growth charts. Height-for-age, weight-for-age,
and BMI-for-age z-scores were also calculated using Stata
"zanthro" command and averaged. The following sex- and
age-specific weight-for-age cut-off points were considered,
as they represent the percentiles seen on various versions of
the Centers for Disease Control growth charts: 3rd, 5th,
10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, and 97th percentiles of the
reference population used to derive these growth charts (9).
For each weight-for-age cut-off point, the following char-
acteristics were calculated, with 95% confidence intervals:
prevalence of subjects at or above this cut-off percentile,
based on the NHANES 1999 to 2004 survey; sensitivity, as
the probability of a weight at or above the weight-for-age
cut-off point among overweight subjects; specificity, as the
probability of a weight below the weight-for-age cut-off
point among non-overweight subjects; positive predictive
value (PPV), as the probability of being overweight among
subjects with a weight at or above the weight-for-age cut-off
point; and negative predictive value (NPV), as the proba-
bility of being non-overweight among subjects with a
weight below the weight-for-age cut-off point (14). It
should be noted that sensitivity and specificity are indepen-
dent of the prevalence of overweight in the population
studied, while prevalence of subjects at or above the weight-
for-age cut-off percentile, PPV, and NPV are dependent on
the prevalence of overweight in the study population and are
reported here for the NHANES 1999 to 2004 study sample.
The PPV and NPV, however, can easily be calculated in a
different population with known prevalence of overweight
using Bayes' rule (14). For selected weight-for-age cut-off
points, prevalence at or above the cut-off point, sensitivity,
specificity, PPV, and NPV were examined for homogeneity
between sexes, and among age groups, and racial/ethnic
groups, using the 2 test. The analyses were repeated using
overfat status instead of overweight status as the criterion
method.
Results
The prevalence of overweight status is reported in
Table 1. Overall, 15.7% of the subjects had a BMI at or at
or above the 95th percentile (overweight), while only 7.2%
had a sum of skinfold thickness at or above the 95th per-
centile (overfat). On average (95% confidence interval) in
this sample, height-for-age z-score was 0.18 (0.15 to 0.21),
weight-for-age z-score was 0.46 (0.42 to 0.50), and BMI-
for-age z-score was 0.44 (0.40 to 0.48). For each weight-
for-age cut-off point, prevalence at or above the cut-off
point, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for overweight
or overfat status are reported in Table 2 for the entire sample
of 12,382 subjects from the NHANES 1999 to 2004 survey.
No single weight-for-age cut-off point was found to identify
overweight or overfat children and adolescents with accept-
able values for all indicators of accuracy that we examined.
However, based on these results, and depending on the goal
(high sensitivity, high specificity, high PPV, or high NPV),
the weight-for-age percentile cut-offs most likely to be used
to identify population subgroups with large numbers of
overweight children and adolescents are the 90th, 95th, and
97th percentiles. For these percentile cut-offs, comparisons
of prevalence at or above the cut-off point, sensitivity,

Discussion
In this study, no single weight-for-age percentile cut-off
point had acceptable values to identify clinically overweight
children and adolescents for all predictive values. This is not
surprising, considering that tall children can have an ele-
vated weight-for-age without being overweight and that
short children can have a low weight-for-age while still
being overweight. This finding reinforces the recommenda-
tion to measure height systematically to calculate, plot, and
track BMI in the routine pediatric healthcare setting, as
recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Centers
for Disease Control (2,9). Outside of the clinical setting, in
particular in the research, epidemiological, and public
health setting, some weight-for-age percentile cut-off points
may, however, be useful to identify groups of children with
a high prevalence of overweight. The implications of our
findings for emergency care, where height is typically not
measured, or for telephone surveys are more difficult to
define.
This study shows that for situations, mostly outside of the
clinical setting, in which height cannot be readily measured,
eliminating the possibility of calculating BMI, some of the
cut-off points of weight-for-age can be used as initial
screening tools to identify subgroups of children who are
likely to be overweight and who should be evaluated
through formal assessment of BMI. For example, if the goal
is to ensure that most overweight children are identified
(high sensitivity), even if the specificity is low and many
non-overweight children are included, the 90th weight-for-
age percentile may provide a useful cut-off point. In con-
trast, if the goal is to ensure that children who are identified
using weight-for-age are very likely to be overweight, i.e.,
high PPV, even if the sensitivity is low and many over-
weight children are not included, the 95th and 97th percen-
tiles may provide useful cut-off points. However, as PPV
and NPV are dependent on the prevalence of overweight in
the population under study, these conclusions may not be
valid in every population.
Even within the U.S. population of children and adoles-
cents, the predictive value of various weight-for-age per-
centile cut-off points may differ significantly. Therefore, the
predictive values of the 3 selected percentile cut-offs were
compared between subgroups of the U.S. pediatric popula-
tion. The weight-for-age percentile cut-offs exhibited simi-
lar characteristics between the subgroups. Even if some of
the subgroup comparisons were statistically significant, due
to the large sample size, the between-group differences in
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were relatively small
within each weight-for-age percentile cut-off, in general
10% between extreme values. Furthermore, with few ex-
ceptions in the extreme values, the distribution of sensitiv-
ity, specificity, PPV, and NPV between subgroups within a
weight-for-age percentile cut-off point did not overlap with
the subgroup distribution within the next percentile cut-off.
Therefore, the choice of weight-for-age percentile cut-offs
for various uses is unlikely to differ between the population
subgroups investigated here. For example, the PPV of the
95th weight-for-age percentile cut-offs was above 74%, and
the PPV of the 97th percentile above 84% in every subgroup
studied. As the largest differences in predictive values were
observed between racial/ethnic groups, our findings may
not apply to populations with different racial/ethnic com-
position from the U.S. population. As expected in this
contemporary sample of U.S. children and adolescents, av-
erage height-for-age, weight-for-age, and BMI-for-age z-
scores were above 0, reflecting the secular trend in height,
early maturation, and the obesity epidemic.
In general, when using overfat status instead of over-
weight status as criterion variable to assess the predictive
value of weight-for-age percentiles, the sensitivity and spec-
ificity were lower, but in a similar range, with a maximum
difference of 7% between the two analyses. As expected,
because the prevalence of overfat status was about half the
prevalence of overweight status, the PPV of weight-for-age
percentiles was much lower and the NPV much higher for
overfat status than for overweight status.
This study had some limitations. For example, other
racial/ethnic population subgroups were not studied. The
sample size for other racial/ethnic groups is too small in
NHANES to provide meaningful results. Analyses by sub-
group of height status, i.e., comparing the predictive values
for short and tall children, were not performed, as the
premise of this study was to examine use of weight-for-age
in the absence of height measurement. Although BMI is a
good tool to identify overweight children and adolescents,
definitions based on BMI alone clearly are not gold stan-
dards because, in the pediatric age, body composition can
vary greatly at similar BMI levels (15). Using the sum of
triceps and subscapular skinfolds at or above the 95th per-
centile of a reference population in secondary analyses
provided similar results as using the Centers for Disease
Control definition of overweight. However, this definition
of overfat status also has important limitations, as it ac-
counts only for subcutaneous fat, as skinfold thickness can
be difficult to measure in obese individuals, and as no
cut-off points are widely recognized. Furthermore, unlike
the Centers for Disease Control BMI growth charts, the
available skinfold thickness percentiles that were used in the
present study have not been statistically smoothed (13),
which may have resulted in misclassification. These limita-
tions highlight the need for a clear and widely recognized
definition of excess adiposity in the pediatric age, against
which other assessment methods can be compared. This
study also had unique strengths, such as the large nationally
representative sample, rigorous measurement methods, in-

cluding measured rather than self-reported weight and
height, and the possibility of comparing various subgroups
of the U.S. pediatric population.
In summary, weight-for-age percentiles cannot be used as
surrogates for BMI-for-age percentiles to screen for over-
weight among children and adolescents. In the circum-
stances where height is not available, such as existing da-
tabases, some of the weight-for-age percentile cut-off points
can be used as screening tools to identify population sub-
groups more likely to be overweight. These cut-off points
may be useful in research or public health projects to
identify large numbers of overweight subjects but should
not be used clinically in individual patients.
