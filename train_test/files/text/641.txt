DataWatch
Trends In Health Insurance Coverage In California, 1989-1993
by E. Richard Brown
Abstract: California's uninsurance rate of 22.7 percent is higher than the national average. The state's
rate of employment-based insurance coverage--below the national average--is declining because of
rising health insurance premiums, falling family incomes, and the changing structure of the economy
and the labor market. Growing Medicaid coverage, fostered by expanded eligibility and falling
incomes, has prevented rapid growth in the state's uninsured population. Anticipated cutbacks in
federal Medicaid funding, however, would increase California's uninsurance rate. Continuing cut-
backs in health services for the uninsured would reduce their access to health care and increase stress
on many private health services.
California's uninsurance rate has persistently exceeded the national
average. Compared with the nation as a whole, a relatively smaller
and declining proportion of California's population is covered by
employment-based health insurance. Expansion of Medicaid eligibility has
offset declining employment-based health insurance, slowing growth of the
state's uninsured population and improving access to care for pregnant
women and young children. Cutbacks in Medi-Cal (California Medicaid),
however, together with changes in the health care market, are likely to
increase California's already high uninsurance rate. Increases in the number
of uninsured persons, coupled with cutbacks in state and local health services
for the medically indigent, are likely to reduce access to health services for
this population and strain resources, even for persons with insurance.
This DataWatch examines changes in health insurance coverage in
California between 1989 and 1993, focusing especially on lack of insurance,
employment-based health insurance, and Medi-Cal in relation to family
work status. The analyses describe changes over time within California and
in comparison with the United States as a whole.
Study methods. The March 1990 and March 1994 Current Population
Surveys (CPS) were used to develop estimates for California and the
United States. The U.S. Census Bureau, which conducts the CPS, inter-
views a rotating sample of approximately 60,000 households nationwide,

obtaining information on more than 150,000 persons, including more than
14,000 persons in California. The analyses for this DataWatch are based on
population weights for each year derived from the 1990 census, with an
adjustment for the census undercount; estimates for 1990 may differ from
those of other researchers who use CPS weights based on the 1980 census.1
Persons insured by any source at any time during the preceding year were
counted as insured. Because a person may report multiple sources of cover-
age during the preceding year, we created a single hierarchical variable that
reflects a rank ordering of reported coverage. Persons were classified as
having employment-based coverage if they had a group health plan. They
were classified as having private insurance if they did not have employ-
ment-based coverage but had other private insurance. Persons who had
neither type of coverage but reported Medicaid coverage at any time during
the year were classified as covered by Medicaid. Persons who had none of
these types of coverage but were covered by Medicare or the Civilian
Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) or
were eligible for medical care through the Veterans Affairs (VA) system
were classified as having "other public coverage." Finally, those who re-
ported no coverage from any source were considered uninsured.
CPS data generate estimates for Medicaid coverage that are lower than
those derived from Medicaid administrative data. Some persons who are
identified in the CPS as uninsured may in fact be covered by Medicaid, and
some who report having private insurance coverage in the CPS actually
may be enrolled in private managed care plans whose premiums are paid by
Medicaid. In addition, our hierarchical health insurance variable classifies
persons who, at some time during the preceding year, had Medicaid cover-
age and employment-based or private insurance as having the latter cover-
age, rather than Medicaid. We have not adjusted the CPS estimates to
match the Medicaid administrative data.
The CPS is the database most widely used to estimate health insurance
status and coverage at the state level because it is a large national survey
with a sampling method designed to produce state-level as well as national
estimates. Despite the limitations inherent in its health insurance ques-
tions, the CPS thus has advantages over most other national surveys that
obtain more comprehensive information about health insurance but do not
lend themselves to state-level estimates.
The CPS yields reasonably precise estimates of insurance coverage for
large groups in California because the state's sample size is large. Analyses
of subgroups are less precise because the smaller numbers of respondents in
sample subgroups make population estimates for them subject to greater
error. All differences in proportions reported in the narrative of this Data-
Watch are statistically significant at p < .01, and most at p< .0001.2

Study Findings
Profile of Califomians' insurance coverage. In 1993, 22.7 percent of
nonelderly Califomians (6.5 million children and adults) were completely
uninsured (Exhibit 1). This uninsurance rate is essentially unchanged from
1989 (Exhibit 2), although the number of uninsured persons grew by
177,000 (Exhibit 3). California's uninsurance rate in 1993 was one-fourth
higher than the national rate of 18.2 percent. More than one of every six of
the 41-5 million uninsured Americans lives in California.
Just 53.8 percent of nonelderly Califomians were covered by employ-
ment-based health insurance, obtained through their own or a family
member's employment--down from 56.8 percent in 1989 and continuing a
long decline that had begun by 1980.3 National rates of employment-based
health coverage also fell, from 65.8 percent in 1989 to 61.2 percent in 1993,
but remained well above California's rate throughout this period. Chil-
dren's employment-based coverage in California fell from 52 percent to
48.8 percent between 1989 and 1993, a slightly larger drop than for
nonelderly adults (ages eighteen to sixty-four) (Exhibit 2).
Some 221,000 fewer Califomians had employment-based health insur-
ance in 1993 than in 1989 (Exhibit 3). Taking into account population
growth, if California's rate of employment-based coverage had remained
the same in 1993 as it was in 1989, 868,000 more persons would have had
such coverage in 1993.
The uninsurance rate remained flat overall and declined for children

because Medi-Cal coverage offset falling employment-based coverage. One
of every seven nonelderly Califomians in 1993 was covered by Medi-Cal at
some time during the year, an increase of 1.2 million beneficiaries from
1989. Medi-Cal covered one of every four children in California in 1993,
up from fewer than one of every five children in 1989. As the findings of
this study demonstrate, the expansion of Medi-Cal has spared California a
substantial increase in its uninsured population, despite declining employ-
ment-based coverage. Proposed cutbacks in Medicaid funding, however,
threaten to limit the program's ability to absorb low-income children who
lose employment-based insurance and thus to increase the state's uninsured
population.
California's uninsured population. More than eight of every ten unin-
sured Califomians are workers and their families. Among the uninsured,
41.8 percent (2.7 million persons) were in families headed by a full-time,
full-year employee in 1993 (Exhibit 4). Another 16.8 percent (1.1 million)

whites (Exhibit 2). However, between 1989 and 1993 the uninsurance rate
for Latinos fell, while the rates for other ethnic groups grew--especially for
African Americans.
Californians are more likely than the average American to be uninsured.
In 1993, for example, Californians' uninsurance rates were higher than the
national average among those living in families with a full-time, full-year
worker, those living in families headed by a part-time worker, and those in
families headed by a self-employed person.
Although this California disadvantage affects both lower-income and
more affluent working families, the California/national differences are
greater among low-income families in each group. Among families with a
full-time, full-year worker that are below 200 percent of the poverty level,
for example, 29.4 percent are uninsured nationally, compared with 38.7
percent of Californians.
Employment-based coverage. Employment-based coverage declined
among many groups of adult workers. It fell among full-time, full-year
employees (workers with the best prospects of receiving health benefits);
among employees in firms of all sizes but especially medium-size firms
(twenty-five to ninety-nine employees); and in most industries, including
both high- and low-coverage sectors of the state's economy.
Employment-based coverage also declined sharply among families
headed by a self-employed worker (Exhibit 2). Among persons in families
headed by a full- or part-time employee, employment-based coverage re-
mained statistically unchanged.
California's economy does not distribute employment-based insurance
equally among the state's ethnic groups. Among families with a full-time,
full-year employee, only 56.1 percent of Latinos and 71.5 percent of Afri-
can Americans had employment-based coverage in 1993, well below the
rates for non-Latino whites (81.9 percent) and Asians (83.3 percent).
Among families with a full-time, part-year employee, families with a part-
time employee, and those with a self-employed worker, Asians share the
disadvantage of Latinos and African Americans, compared with non-
Latino whites. Between 1989 and 1993 Asians were the only group to
improve their rate of employment-based coverage, while African Ameri-
cans' coverage plummeted.
Employment-based health insurance is much less prevalent among low-
income working families than among those with higher incomes. Among
families with a full-time, full-year employee, only 40.8 percent of those with
family incomes below 200 percent of poverty had employment-based cover-
age in 1993, compared with 83.7 percent of those with family incomes
above that level. The income disparities are even greater among families
with a full-time, part-year employee; only 21.9 percent of those below 200

percent of poverty had employment-based coverage, compared with 67.2
percent among persons in more affluent families.
Employment-based coverage rates changed little between 1989 and 1993
among low-income and higher-income families. Among families below 200
percent of the poverty level, 22 percent had employment-based coverage in
both years, while among more affluent families, 74-75 percent had such
coverage in both years.
Despite flat rates of employment-based coverage within income groups,
incomes declined among all types of working families between 1989 and
1993. Among families with a full-time, full-year employee as well as those
with a full-time, part-year employee, a part-time employee, or a self-
employed worker, middle-class incomes declined, and increasing numbers
of these families lived in poverty. As their incomes declined, working
families lost employment-based coverage.
Medi-Cal. Nearly half (46.6 percent) of nonelderly Medi-Cal beneficiar-
ies are in working families (Exhibit 4), virtually all of them below 200
percent of the federal poverty level (for a family of four in 1993, for
example, this means family income below $29,526). One-third (32.2 per-
cent) of all nonelderly Medi-Cal beneficiaries are children and nonelderly
adults in families headed by a full-time employee.
Nevertheless, Medi-Cal, like Medicaid nationally, remains a program
especially targeted to nonworking families with children, particularly those
headed by a single parent. Slightly more than half (53.4 percent) of
nonelderly Medi-Cal beneficiaries are in families with no working adult,
the majority of which are single-parent households.
Congressionally mandated, as well as state-initiated, enhancements in
income eligibility for pregnant women and young children have increased
the proportion of low-income persons who qualify for Medicaid benefits.
California raised the income eligibility standard to 200 percent of the
poverty level for infants and pregnant women, to 133 percent of poverty for
children up to age six, and 100 percent for many older children (those born
after 1983). Medi-Cal coverage of the state's near-poor (family income
100-199 percent of poverty) rose from 16.8 percent in 1989 to 20.8 percent
(well above the national rate of 12.8 percent) in 1993.
These eligibility changes increased Medi-Cal's importance as a source of
coverage for low-income children, relatively few of whom have job-based
coverage and many of whom depend on Medi-Cal as their sole coverage.
Medi-Cal coverage rose from 42.4 percent of low-income children under
age six (family income below 200 percent of poverty) in 1989 to 53.2
percent in 1993, lowering their uninsurance rate from 28.3 percent to 23
percent, even though their rate of employment-based coverage remained
statistically unchanged.

126 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Spring 1996
Compared with the national average, California's relatively generous
income eligibility provisions allow more of the state's nonelderly popula-
tion to qualify for Medicaid, whether living in single-parent families (44.7
percent in California versus 39.1 percent nationally) or in married-couple
families (11.5 percent in California versus 6.6 percent nationally). Given
the state's large proportion of low-income working families that are not
covered by employment-based health insurance, California's relative gener-
osity in Medicaid eligibility has restrained growth in the number of unin-
sured persons and the rate of uninsurance.
Other coverage. The proportion of all nonelderly Californians covered
by privately purchased health insurance remained statistically unchanged
between 1989 and 1993, increasing slightly only among families with a
full-time, full-year employee and declining among those with a part-time
employee or self-employed worker, as well as among nonworking families.
Other public programs, namely Medicare and CHAMPUS, covered a
slightly smaller proportion of the population in 1993 than they did in 1989.
Discussion And Policy Implications
Health insurance coverage in California is plagued by several fundamen-
tal problems: declining employment-based health insurance, proposed caps
in federal Medicaid funding, and pending cutbacks in state and local
spending on indigent medical care. The effects of these problems are likely
to be magnified by increasing competition in the health care market.
Several factors contribute to California's high uninsurance rate, but the
underlying problem is the continuing deterioration of employment-based
coverage. Although this decline parallels the national trend, the problem
has been more severe in California, for several reasons.
Falling incomes. Declining family incomes made health insurance less
affordable for California's working families. In 1993, 20 percent of Califor-
nia's nonelderly population were living in poverty, a rate one-third higher
than the 1989 level; and 40 percent of the nonelderly were below 200
percent of the poverty level, well above the 1989 share of 33 percent. Even
among families with a full-time, full-year employee, 23 percent had family
incomes below 200 percent of poverty in 1993, up from 19 percent in 1989.
Driven by California's loss of aerospace contracts, the long recession, and
more general economic restructuring, this decline in income reduced the
resources that could be spent on the employee's share of health insurance
premiums--or to buy health insurance in the private market.4
Decreased job opportunities. Second, the conditions that drove down
family incomes also decreased employment opportunities. California's
workforce participation rate fell from 80 percent of persons ages eighteen to

sixty-four in 1989 to 77 percent in 1993, well below the national average of
81 percent. The proportion of the nonelderly population in nonworking
families increased from 12 percent to 14 percent, thus also reducing oppor-
tunities to obtain employment-based coverage. At the same time, families
headed by a part-time employee increased from 7 percent to 9 percent of
the nonelderly population, while the proportion in families headed by a
full-time employee dropped from 73 percent to 70 percent. Families sup-
ported by self-employment also declined, from 8 percent of the nonelderly
population to just 6 percent, probably accelerated by the growing business
failure rate. Another contributing factor, in both California and the nation
as a whole, was a shift in employment from largely unionized, higher-
paying, high-coverage industries (such as durable goods manufacturing and
public administration) to mainly nonunionized, lower-wage, low-coverage
industries (such as services and retail trades).
It is unclear to what extent these trends are the result of California's deep
recession--and thus might be eased with economic recovery--and to what
extent they are the result of broader globalization and restructuring of the
economy--and therefore are more permanent conditions that will con-
tinue to undermine employment-based insurance coverage.
Rising insurance costs. Finally, between 1989 and 1993 employment-
based health insurance grew increasingly expensive for both employers and
workers, rising about 13 percent per year on average for health mainte-
nance organizations (HMOs), 17 percent annually for preferred provider
organizations (PPOs), and 19 percent annually for fee-for-service indem-
nity plans.5 By 1993 the national average annual cost for single-person
coverage exceeded $2,000, and for family coverage, exceeded $5,200. Ris-
ing premium costs led many firms to restructure their health benefit pro-
grams by purchasing less-expensive health plans, changing eligibility rules,
and shifting more costs to workers. Between 1988 and 1993 employers
increased workers' share of premium costs for single coverage from 19
percent to 29 percent of the total, on average, and for family coverage from
10 percent to 25 percent, on average.6
Employees and their families--faced with declining incomes, rising
health insurance premiums, and a larger share of costs--found it increas-
ingly difficult to pay for employment-based coverage or to buy coverage in
the private nongroup market. By 1991 only 83 percent of full-time employ-
ees in the nation's medium- and large-size private firms participated in
health plans offered by their employers, down from 92 percent in 1989.7
Public programs. During the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s,
Congress and the states, including California, expanded Medicaid eligibil-
ity, thereby offsetting much of the decline in employment-based coverage.
These changes enabled more working families to qualify for Medi-Cal

coverage, while declining family incomes dropped more Californians into
eligible income brackets. Between 1989 and 1993 the number of nonelderly
persons in families with a full-time employee increased less than 1 percent,
while the number of persons in this group who were covered by Medi-Cal
increased 55 percent.
Many poor and near-poor working families with children received Medi-
Cal coverage, while other working families and individuals were left to seek
needed care from county health programs and from private-sector and
community-based providers. This shift from employment-based, private
insurance to public-sector coverage carries substantial fiscal consequences.
Public programs in California spent nearly $4 billion in 1992--$3.2 billion
by Medi-Cal and $795 million by state and county indigent medical serv-
ices programs--to provide health services to children and adults in em-
ployed families not covered by employer-provided health insurance.8
These taxpayer-funded services are not only a benefit provided to those
who receive the services. They also subsidize employers that do not provide
their workers with health benefits, since the provision of employment-
based insurance, despite its decline, remains the norm for the majority of
employees and their families. Employers that do contribute to their employ-
ees' health benefits, in effect, pay three times: once when they pay the costs
of coverage for their workers; a second time in the form of a hidden
surcharge on their employees' health benefits to pay for private-sector
services used by the uninsured; and a third time in their taxes, part of which
fund Medicaid and county health services provided to working families not
covered by employment-based health insurance.9 Employees, of course, also
share in these financial burdens.
California has attempted to make health insurance more affordable for
small firms and their workers. In 1993 The Health Insurance Plan of
California (The HIPC), a state-run purchasing cooperative, began offering
private coverage to workers and their dependents in eligible small firms.
Two years later The HIPC covered more than 91,000 persons, but only 21
percent of employers that signed up with the program had previously not
provided insurance coverage, and only 14 percent of enrollees had pre-
viously been uninsured--fewer than 13,000 persons, or 0.2 percent of
California's uninsured population.10
Although helpful to some firms and workers, The HIPC and similar
purchasing cooperatives are unlikely to overcome the more fundamental
barriers to coverage: the low incomes of many working families and indi-
viduals, and the lack of incentives or requirements for employers to provide
health benefits to their workers. For persons at 200 percent of the poverty
level, for example, the premium for a comprehensive health plan would
consume at least 15 percent of annual family income. More than 60 percent

of California's uninsured persons have incomes below that level.
Thus, the solution to the uninsurance problem in California and nation-
ally depends on making coverage affordable for working families. Without
a financial contribution from an employer or government, health insurance
is simply unaffordable for most working families and individuals, especially
those who are now uninsured. Employers have provided health insurance if
it is necessary to attract and retain employees in a firm's labor market or
because of collective bargaining agreements with unions; however, these
incentives are much weaker now than they were in the past. Employers are
unlikely to reverse the long-term decline in employment-based health
benefits in the absence of the type of mandate that business successfully
fought in the recent health care reform struggle.11
While employer-sponsored coverage has been declining, government has
offset the burden on the private sector by expanding Medicaid coverage and
local government medical services for the uninsured. But the 104th Con-
gress and the states are likely to cut such government assistance, which
potentially could leave many more than the current 6.5 million Califor-
nians completely uninsured. Their access to health services will be more
compromised if Medi-Cal is capped or cut and if local government health
services are eliminated or cut back. Growing numbers of uninsured pa-
tients, with fewer public-sector resources available to them, would threaten
the financial viability of private hospitals that serve this disadvantaged
population. Faced with cost-conscious purchasers' demands for lower prices
in an increasingly competitive health care market, providers likely would
respond by cutting or eliminating charity care, the costs of which can no
longer be shifted to private payers.
The downward slope of employment-based health insurance, and the
financing it provides for health services, poses serious challenges for Cali-
fornia and the nation. It portends shrinking access to care for those who do
not have such coverage, higher costs to employers that provide their work-
ers with health benefits, a growing fiscal burden for public programs that
provide health services to uninsured working families, and growing finan-
cial vulnerability among the private providers that serve this population.
The proposed cutbacks in Medicaid funding are likely to increase the
number of uninsured persons and exacerbate the stresses on both the
public- and private-sector financing of health services. These conditions
may force a return to the health care reform issues that Congress left
unresolved in 1994.

for family work categories and other subgroups range from ± 0.5 percent to ± 2.9 percent
of the estimated percentage, depending on the subgroup. These confidence intervals
are approximations derived from generalized standard error tables provided by the U.S.
