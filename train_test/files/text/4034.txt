Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the presence of immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT)4 and costimu-
latory proteins (CD40, CD80 and CD86), as well as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a production in
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from patients with psoriatic arthritis, before and after treatment
with the antitumour necrosis factor-a therapy, adalimumab.
Methods: Peripheral blood monocytes from patients with psoriatic arthritis and healthy controls
were cultured with CD40 ligand (CD40L) to stimulate differentiation to APCs. Cell-surface
phenotype was analysed via fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
Results: CD40L-stimulation resulted in significantly more ILT4þ monocytes in cultures from
control subjects (n ¼ 21) than those from patients (n ¼ 20). ILT4-positivity on CD40L-stimulated
monocytes was negatively correlated with disease activity in patients. Adalimumab treatment
resulted in significant increases from baseline in ILT4-positivity, and in decreases in CD40, CD80
and CD86-positivity in monocytes from patients.
Conclusion: The effect of adalimumab on monocyte surface phenotype may be due to
modification of the inflammatory milieu associated with therapy-induced reduction of disease
activity in psoriatic arthritis.

Introduction
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory
autoimmune disease characterized by inflam-
matory arthritis and psoriasis.1 Inhibitory
immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) recep-
tors have a negative influence on the stimula-
tory capacity of antigen-presenting cells
(APCs). High levels of inhibitory ILT recep-
tors are found on the surface of all APCs,
along with inhibition of nuclear factor-kB
activation and CD40-induced upregulation of
costimulatory proteins, with a consequent
effect on T-cells.2 Although inhibitory ILTs
appear to be upregulated in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis, little is known about
their expression in psoriatic arthritis.3
The aim of the present study was to
investigate the presence of ILT4 and costi-
mulatory proteins (CD40, CD80 and
CD86), as well as tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-a production, in peripheral blood
monocyte-derived APCs from patients
with psoriatic arthritis, before and after
treatment with the anti-TNF-a therapy,
adalimumab.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited adult patients (>18-
years-old) with moderate-to-severe psori-
atic arthritis (diagnosed according to
CASPAR criteria4) who were attending the
Rheumatology Unit, University of Rome
``Tor Vergata'', Rome, Italy, between April
2013 and March 2014. Patients were
required to be nai¨ve to biological therapies
and be eligible for adalimumab treatment.
All patients received 40 mg adalimumab via
subcutaneous injection every other week.
Blood samples were taken and disease activ-
ity was assessed by measuring the disease
activity score (DAS)5 immediately before
the first adalimumab dose and at week 12. A
group of matched healthy control subjects
were recruited from blood donors attending
the Universitary Hospital ``Policlinico Tor
Vergata'', Rome, Italy.
The study protocol was approved by the
ethics committee of the University of Rome
``Tor Vergata''. All patients and healthy
subjects provided written informed consent
prior to enrolment.
Materials
Soluble trimeric CD40L was purchased from
R&D system, San Diego, CA, USA.
Lipoplysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia
coli 0111/B4 was purchased from Sigma
Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO, USA. All
compounds and media used in this study
were analysed for endotoxin contamination
using the limulus amebocyte lysate test (QCL-
1000, BioWhittaker, Inc, Walkersville, MD,
USA). All samples were free of endotoxin
contamination (<0.1EU/ml).
Cell culture
Peripheral blood (from controls or patients)
was enriched for peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMC) by centrifugation at
300 g for 30 min at 20C. over Ficoll
Hypaque (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences,
Uppsala, Sweden). PBMC were either
immediately analysed via fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS; see below) or
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supple-
mented with 20% heat inactivated fetal
calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine,
Chimenti et al. 23
50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin
and 500 ng/ml CD40L (complete medium).
Cells were plated in 96-well V-bottom plates
at a concentration of 5 Â 105 cells/well in
250 ml of complete medium and incubated
for 72 h at 37C in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% carbon dioxide in air, in the presence
or absence of 0.5 mg/ml CD40L, then ana-
lysed by FACS.
To evaluate the ability of sera from
patients with psoriatic arthritis to modulate
ILT4 positivity, buffy coat monocytes were
obtained from healthy subjects by elutri-
ation. Elutriated monocytes were plated at
5 Â 105 cells/well in 250 ml complete medium
without FCS, and cultured for 72 h with the
addition of 20% serum from each patient
(obtained at baseline just before the first
administration of adalimumab) or control,
or 20% FCS (negative control). Cells were
then analysed by FACS. To evaluate intra-
cellular cytokine production the cells were
washed in PBS (pH 7.4) at the end of the
incubation period, then incubated with fresh
complete medium containing 1 mg/ml of the
protein transport inhibitor brefeldin A, with
or without 100 ng/ml LPS.
FACS
Cells were washed once with washing buffer
(3% FCS and 0.1% sodium azide in phos-
phate buffered saline [PBS, pH 7.4]), then
2 Â 105 cells were incubated for 30min at 4C
in the dark with: R-phycoerythrin-cyanine
(PC5)-conjugated anti-CD14 (Immunotech,
Marseille, France), phycoerythrin (PE)-
conjugated anti-ILT4 (Immunotech; clone:
PN A22334), fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated anti-CD40, anti-CD80
and anti-CD86 (BD Biosciences, San Jose
`
CA, USA) (all diluted 1:10). For the deter-
mination of intracellular cytokine produc-
tion, cells were washed with PBS, pH 7.4,
then stained with anti-CD14 and anti-ILT4
as described above. Cells were then permea-
bilized in Cytofix/CytopermTM solution
(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA),
stained with anti-TNF-a (R&D systems,
San Diego, CA, USA; diluted 1:10) for
30 min at room temperature, then analysed
by FACS. The negative range and staining
specificity for each cell-surface marker and
cytokine was established using a corres-
ponding isotype-matched control antibody,
conjugated with the same fluorescent dye.
Flow cytometry was performed using
a FACScanTM flow cytometer and analysed
with CellQuestTM software (Beckton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). For
each analysis, 104 events were gated on CD14
expression and a light-scatter gate designed to
either include only viable cells (surface markers
determination) or exclude cellular debris (deter-
mination of intracellular cytokine production).
Statistical analyses
The Kolmogorov­Smirnov goodness-of-fit
test was used to assess normality of distri-
bution. Comparisons between distributions
of two variables for a single group were
performed by Student's unpaired t-test or
Mann­Whitney U-test. Correlations were
evaluated using Pearson's parametric test
for univariate analysis. Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSSÕ version 10.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ, and P values <0.05 were con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
The study included 20 patients with psoriatic
arthritis (six male/14 female; mean age
47.3 Æ 11.5 years; age range 23­67 years)
and 21 healthy control subjects (11 male/10
female; mean age 44.7 Æ 15.7 years; age
range 28­59 years). Demographic and clin-
ical characteristics of the study population
are given in Table 1.
There was no significant difference
between patients and controls in the number
of ILT4þ monocytes in freshly isolated

PBMCs. CD40L-stimulation resulted in sig-
nificantly more ILT4þ monocytes in cultures
from control subjects than those from
patients (P< 0.005; Figure 1a). There was
no significant increase in ILT4þ monocyte
numbers following CD40L-stimulation of
PBMCs from patients.
Disease activity score was negatively
correlated with ILT4þ monocyte numbers
in CD40L-stimulated cultures from patients
(r ¼ ­0.582, P ¼ 0.02; Figure 1b).
When CD40L-stimulated cells were
sorted for ILT4, significantly more ILT4À
than ILT4þ monocytes were positive for
CD40, CD80 and CD86 (P < 0.05 for each
comparison; Figure 1c). In addition, there
were significantly more CD40, CD80 and
CD86-positive cells in ILT4À monocytes
from patients than controls (P ¼ 0.0048,
P ¼ 0.0011 and P ¼ 0.0074, respectively;
Figure 1c).
When spontaneous TNF-a production
was analysed at single-cell level in the total
monocyte population and ILT4þ and ILT4­
monocyte subsets from patients and con-
trols (Figure 1d), TNF-a production was
found to be restricted to ILT4­ monocytes.
There was no significant difference between
patients and controls in TNF-a production
by ILT4­ monocytes.
Adalimumab treatment resulted in a sig-
nificant increase in ILT4 positivity and
decreases in costimulatory molecule-positive
cell numbers compared with baseline
(P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 1e).
There was a significant positive correlation
between the ILT4-positivity at week 12 and
change in DAS44 (r ¼ 0.571, P ¼ 0.02;
Figure 1f).
Discussion
The present study found that CD40L-sti-
mulation resulted in significantly more
ILT4þ monocytes in PBMC cultures from
control subjects than those from patients
with psoriatic arthritis. APCs expressing
high levels of ILT4 are known to anergize
allospecific CD4þ CD45ROþ CD25þ T-cells
and convert them into regulatory T (Treg)
cells, propagating the T-cell suppression
cascade.6 The regulatory properties of
ILT4 are mediated by downregulation of
the costimulatory proteins CD40, CD80 and
CD86, hindering their ability to activate
CD4þ cells.7 Thus, the downregulation of
ILT4 and upregulation of costimulatory pro-
teins on monocytes from patients with psori-
atic arthritis may suggest that these cells
acquire an activated/nontolerogenic pheno-
type that may contribute to abnormally high
APC activation. Inappropriate APC activity
in affected joints, together with the accumu-
lation of activated T-cells, may drive the
initiation and persistence of T-cell activation.8
In conclusion, 12 weeks' treatment with
adalimumab resulted in a significant
increase in ILT4-positive cells and reduced
numbers of CD40, CD80 and CD86-positive
cells in monocytes from patients with

psoriatic arthritis. This effect may be related
to the ability of adalimumab to block the
TNF-a effect in vivo, which may then inhibit
ILT4 production by APCs.9 However, the
direct relationship we found between ILT4-
positivity and the change in DAS44 after
treatment suggests that the effect of adali-
mumab on monocyte surface phenotype
may be due to modification of the inflam-
matory milieu associated with therapy-
induced reduction of disease activity.
