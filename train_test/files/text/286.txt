The purpose of this study was to characterize the relation between smokeless tobacco use and the risk of all-
cause and disease-specific mortality. Using data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Epidemiologic Followup Study, the authors assessed the 20-year mortality experience of smokeless tobacco
users. Subjects aged 45 years or more at baseline (1971­1975) were categorized as either smokeless tobacco
users (n = 1,068) or non-smokeless tobacco users (n = 5,737). Subjects were further stratified by smoking status
and gender. Proportional hazard ratios were used to assess associations. After adjustment for confounders, no
association between smokeless tobacco use and all-cause (hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9,
1.3), all cancer (hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.6, 1.9), or all cardiovascular (hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.5)
mortality was found. There was an increase in all cancer mortality of borderline significance among female
smokeless tobacco users (hazard ratio = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.8). The lung cancer mortality rate among combined
users (smokeless tobacco and cigarettes), based on the rates for exclusive smokeless tobacco users and
exclusive smokers, was higher than expected, possibly because of heavier smoking among these subjects. The
mortality experience of smokeless tobacco users was not significantly greater than that of non-tobacco users and
was appreciably less than that of cigarette smokers. Furthermore, combined use of smokeless tobacco and
cigarettes did not increase overall mortality beyond that expected from use of the individual products.

Smokeless tobacco use may be associated with an increase
in oral cancer incidence (1) and with elevated rates of other
cancers and cardiovascular disease (2­4). However, little
research has been done on the relation between smokeless
tobacco use and mortality from chronic diseases. We inves-
tigated the relation between smokeless tobacco use and
mortality from both broad classifications of chronic disease
and several specific disease outcomes. Because information
on smoking status was available, we also compared the
effects of smokeless tobacco use with that of cigarette
smoking and investigated the mortality associated with the
combined use of these two tobacco products.
There is growing interest in the possible adverse health
effects of smokeless tobacco because of the increasing prev-
alence of smokeless tobacco use among young adult White
males (5, 6) and the role of smokeless tobacco as a nicotine
replacement for cigarette smoking (7). The prevalence of
smokeless tobacco use among adolescents (students in
grades 9­12) increased from 2.2 percent in 1970 to 9.3
percent in 1997, with White males having the highest preva-
lence (20.6 percent) (8, 9). According to the 1989 Teenage
Attitudes and Practices Survey, each day more than 2,200
adolescents (ages 12­18 years) first try smokeless tobacco
and about 830 (38 percent) become regular users (10).
Smokeless tobacco may be used by some smokers as a
method to quit smoking and by others as a substitute for
cigarettes in locations where cigarette smoking is not
allowed. A recent Swedish study found that smokeless
tobacco use can lead to higher smoking quit rates (11). A
1986 US tobacco survey found that approximately 7 percent

Mortality among Smokeless Tobacco Users 731
Am J Epidemiol 2002;156:730­737
of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other
tobacco products (including snuff and chewing tobacco) for
cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking (7). One national
survey found that, among current smokeless tobacco users,
one third were former smokers (12), suggesting that smoke-
less tobacco is occasionally used as a substitute for ciga-
rettes. Recently, some researchers have proposed smokeless
tobacco as nicotine replacement therapy for inveterate ciga-
rette smokers (13). The use of smokeless tobacco as a safe
alternative to cigarette smoking requires a complete under-
standing of the risks associated with smokeless tobacco use.
Our aims are to assess the potential increased mortality
risks associated with ever smokeless tobacco use in a repre-
sentative sample of the US population and to evaluate the
effects of the combined use of smokeless tobacco and ciga-
rette smoking on mortality from chronic diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources for determination of mortality risk
associated with smokeless tobacco use
We used data from the First National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I) and the NHANES I
Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) to determine
whether any increased mortality risks were associated with
smokeless tobacco use. The prospective nature of the data
collection provided a unique opportunity to examine
multiple mortality outcomes over an approximate 20-year
follow-up period. The wide range of available information
on a variety of risk factors allowed us to control for many
potential confounders.
The survey design and data collection methods of
NHANES I and NHEFS have been described elsewhere (14­
19). Briefly, NHANES I was a national probability sample
of the noninstitutionalized US population conducted from
1971 to 1975, with oversampling of the elderly, the poor, and
women of childbearing age. NHANES I used a multistage
sampling design leading to unequal probabilities for selec-
tion of sample subjects. The initial survey included in-person
interviews covering a wide array of health behaviors, as well
as a physical examination. The NHEFS surveys were
conducted in 1982­1984, 1986 (limited to subjects >55 years
of age at baseline), 1987, and 1992 to provide approximately
10, 15, and 20 years of follow-up information.
NHANES I included 14,407 adults ranging from 25 to 74
years of age who underwent a physical examination in 1971­
1975. Of these subjects, 13,861 (96 percent) were success-
fully traced in at least one follow-up survey. By 1992, 4,604
(32 percent) subjects were identified as deceased, with death
certificates available for 98 percent of the decedents.
Exposure variable
Only a random sample (n = 3,847) of all subjects in
NHANES I were asked about smokeless tobacco use at base-
line, but all subjects successfully interviewed during the
1982­1984 NHEFS were asked questions regarding smoke-
less tobacco use. Data from the 1982­1984 NHEFS were
used to infer smokeless tobacco status at baseline when
necessary. Subjects reporting current smokeless tobacco use
in NHANES I or ever use in the 1982­1984 NHEFS were
considered ever smokeless tobacco users (n =1,503) in this
study. Subjects reporting neither current use nor ever use in
either survey were considered never smokeless tobacco
users (n = 10,948). Of the 1,503 ever smokeless tobacco
users, there were 505 (33.6 percent) who had never smoked
("exclusive" smokeless tobacco users), 952 (63.3 percent)
who had ever smoked ("combined" users), and 46 (3.1
percent) with unknown smoking status.
Confounding variables
The demographic variables considered in this analysis
include age at examination, race, sex, region of residence
(Northeast, Midwest, South, West), and poverty index ratio.
A poverty index ratio equal to 1.0 designates the poverty
level, with ratios less than 1.0 below and ratios greater than
1.0 above poverty level. A poverty index ratio was calcu-
lated for only a sample of subjects in NHANES I (n =
11,348). Definitions of these variables are provided in the
Plan and Operation of the Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey, United States--1971­1973 (14).
Cigarette smoking information was gathered on only a
sample of subjects in NHANES I. Pack-years of smoking
were calculated by multiplying the reported average
number of cigarettes smoked daily by the duration smoked
divided by 20 (1 pack = 20 cigarettes). For subjects whose
smoking information was not obtained in NHANES I,
smoking status and pack-years at baseline were inferred
from responses to the 1982­1984 NHEFS, whenever
possible. Other tobacco habits such as pipe or cigar use
were not considered in the formation of tobacco exposure
categories (i.e., a subject who did not use smokeless
tobacco or smoke cigarettes but did smoke a pipe would be
considered a non-tobacco user).
Nutritional information was obtained via a 24-hour recall
dietary questionnaire and was asked of only a sample of the
NHANES I subjects at baseline (n = 11,348). Standard food-
composition data were used to calculate nutrient intake (20).
Other potential confounders for which information was
available from either the baseline interview or the physical
examination include alcohol consumption, recreational
physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, serum
cholesterol, and family history (parents, siblings, or chil-
dren) of cancer.
Outcome variables
Both underlying and multiple cause-of-death codes, using
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9), codes obtained from the death certificate, were
used to categorize deaths. The underlying cause of death was
used to calculate hazard ratios for the broad classifications of
disease, whereas multiple cause-of-death codes were used to
calculate hazard ratios for specific causes of death. Dece-
dents identified only through proxy interview (n = 107) were
not included in this analysis because no ICD-9 code was
available from the data set.

This analysis was limited to White subjects and Black
subjects, because of the small number of subjects in the
"other" race category (n = 172). Because of the differences
in age between exclusive smokeless tobacco users and non-
tobacco users (table 1) and the low prevalence of smokeless
tobacco use among subjects less than 45 years of age, the
mortality analyses were restricted to those subjects 45­75
years of age at baseline (n = 6,805).
Statistical analysis
The distribution of potential confounding variables was
calculated for the four tobacco categories (non-tobacco
users, exclusive smokeless tobacco users, exclusive
smokers, and combined smokeless tobacco users and
smokers). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to
calculate both the crude and the adjusted hazard ratios. Most

analyses were stratified by gender. Follow-up time was
calculated from the date of examination to the time the
subject died, the time the subject was last known alive, or the
endpoint of the study. Subjects lost to follow-up (i.e., not
traced in any of the four studies of the NHEFS) were
excluded from the analyses (n = 100). Subjects with a preex-
isting condition at baseline were excluded for analyses of
that particular condition (e.g., subjects reporting stroke
history at baseline were excluded from all analyses of stroke
outcomes). To account for the complex survey design and
the oversampling of certain populations, SUDAAN software
was used to conduct the majority of the analyses. SUDAAN
software (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, North Carolina) is a software package specifically
designed to analyze data from complex surveys that incorpo-
rate multistage sampling designs and unequally weighted
designs (21).
Standardized mortality ratios were calculated as the
measure of effect for oral cancer. Expected numbers were
based on mortality rates from the National Center for Health
Statistics for 1982, the approximate midpoint of the follow-
up period.
RESULTS
There were 1,068 smokeless tobacco users in this cohort
45 years of age or older, 414 (39 percent) of whom were
never smokers. Exclusive smokeless tobacco users were
older (mean age = 64.9 years), poorer (mean poverty index
ratio = 1.8), and more likely to reside in the South than other
subjects (table 1). Crude differences between smokeless
tobacco users and other subjects also were found in the
frequency of alcohol intake (they drink less often than
smokers), fruit and vegetable intake (less than smokers and
non-tobacco users), and recreational physical exercise (less
than smokers and non-tobacco users). Crude blood pressure
and body mass index levels were higher among exclusive
smokeless tobacco users than for other tobacco categories.
Intakes of vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fat also differed
across the four tobacco use categories.
After adjustment for age, race, gender, and poverty status,
exclusive smokeless tobacco users did not experience statis-
tically significant increased mortality from all causes
(hazard ratio = 1.1, 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.9,
1.3), all cancer (hazard ratio = 1.1, 95 percent CI: 0.6, 1.9),
or all cardiovascular outcomes (hazard ratio = 1.1, 95
percent CI: 0.8, 1.5) compared with non-tobacco users.
Table 2 describes the relation between exclusive smokeless
tobacco use and the causes of death for which there were at
least 30 deaths, stratified by gender. Male smokeless tobacco
users experienced statistically nonsignificant increases in
mortality from endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases
and immunity disorders (hazard ratio = 2.4, 95 percent CI:
0.7, 8.8) and from diseases of the digestive system (hazard
ratio = 1.9, 95 percent CI: 0.4, 9.8). Female smokeless
tobacco users experienced an increase in mortality from all
cancers (hazard ratio = 1.7, 95 percent CI: 1.0, 2.8) of
borderline significance.
Table 3 presents hazard ratios from several specific
chronic diseases. Male exclusive smokeless tobacco users
did not experience significant increases in mortality for any
type of cancer considered. The increased mortality from lung
cancer among female smokeless tobacco users (never or ever
smokers), although statistically significant, was based on
only three deaths and four deaths, respectively. Smokeless
tobacco use was not associated with significant increases in
mortality for ischemic heart disease or stroke in either
gender.

The analyses investigating the combined effects of
smokeless tobacco use and smoking on specific outcomes
were restricted to male subjects because of the low preva-
lence of combined use among females (n = 62). As shown
in table 4, the lung cancer mortality among combined users
was nearly twice that of exclusive smokers (hazard ratios =
22.6 and 13.2, respectively). Combined users did not expe-
rience increased mortality for ischemic heart disease,
although exclusive smokers had a statistically significant
increase in mortality (hazard ratio = 1.6, 95 percent CI: 1.3,
1.9).
There were no oral cancer deaths among exclusive
smokeless tobacco users (table 5). In a cohort of this size
followed for approximately 20 years, only one death would
have been expected. Among ever smokeless tobacco users,
two deaths from oral cancer were observed and two deaths
were expected. Both oral cancer decedents among smoke-
less tobacco users were White males. Once again, this is

what would be expected in a cohort of this size (standard-
ized mortality ratio among White males = 114, 95 percent
CI: 11, 327). Comparatively, among all smokers, 14 oral
cancer deaths were observed, whereas only five were
expected (standardized mortality ratio = 278, 95 percent
CI: 150, 439).
DISCUSSION
The crude hazard ratios show increased mortality among
smokeless tobacco users, largely because smokeless tobacco
users were older than non-tobacco users and smokers. After
controlling for age, gender, race, and poverty status, we
found that smokeless tobacco users did not experience
higher mortality than did non-tobacco users in this cohort.
After stratification by gender, no statistically significant
increases in mortality were found for males. Among females,
a borderline statistically significant increase was found for
all cancer mortality.
Few studies have investigated mortality in relation to
smokeless tobacco use. Results from the National Mortality
Followback Survey showed that smokeless tobacco use was
not associated with increased risk for all cancer, oral cancer,
or cancer of the digestive organs (22). Zahm et al. (23) found
a nonsignificant increase in soft tissue sarcoma among US
veterans who had ever chewed tobacco or used snuff (rela-
tive risk = 1.4, 95 percent CI: 0.8, 2.6), with no soft tissue
sarcoma originating in the head, neck, and face region
among smokeless tobacco users. They found no soft tissue
sarcoma deaths among those who used smokeless tobacco
only. They did find an increase in mortality from buccal
cancer among smokeless tobacco users (relative risk = 3.0,
95 percent CI: 2.0, 4.5) (23). In a recent ecologic study, no
increased mortality rate for oral/pharyngeal cancer was
found in West Virginia, the state with the highest prevalence
of smokeless tobacco use, compared with the United States
as a whole (24). Although few in number, these studies
generally support the results of our analysis.
The scant body of epidemiologic evidence for smokeless
tobacco use and cardiovascular disease mortality differs
from our results. A study of Swedish construction workers
found a small but statistically significant increased risk for
all cardiovascular disease mortality (relative risk = 1.4, 95
percent CI: 1.2, 1.6), ischemic heart disease, and stroke (3).
However, common risk factors for cardiovascular disease
such as blood pressure, exercise, diet, and alcohol were not
controlled and may explain the increased risk. Of note in the
Swedish study was the absence of an increased risk for all
cancer deaths (relative risk = 1.1, 95 percent CI: 0.9, 1.4),
similar to our results. Another study from Sweden found a
small but statistically nonsignificant increased risk from
fatal myocardial infarction (including sudden death) among
snuff dippers (odds ratio = 1.5, 95 percent CI: 0.5, 5.0) (4).
Although smokeless tobacco users in the present study
experienced no increased risk in cardiovascular disease
mortality, smokers experienced a small but statistically
significant increased risk for ischemic heart disease. This
disparity supports evidence that something other than nico-
tine is causing the increase in cardiovascular mortality (25).
Although oral cancer is the adverse effect most accepted as
a consequence of smokeless tobacco use (1), we found no
association between oral cancer mortality and ever smoke-
less tobacco use. Although the number of observed deaths
among exclusive smokeless tobacco users was too small to
calculate a hazard ratio, the number of expected deaths in
this cohort was less than one. The reasons why smokeless
tobacco leads to an increase in oral cancer incidence but not
to an increase in oral cancer mortality may be due to
advances in cancer detection and treatment or to insufficient
follow-up time for deaths to occur among a small number of
cases.
The validity of the data should not be a concern, as the
hazard ratio for oral cancer mortality among cigarette
smokers is similar to the findings of other studies (26). Simi-
larly, the magnitude of association between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer (hazard ratio = 13.2, 95 percent CI:
4.5, 38.2 among males) is consistent with that observed in
other studies, as is the finding of greater lung cancer
mortality among current smokers than former smokers (27).
The complex survey design and oversampling of certain
populations required the use of SUDAAN software to
analyze the data set. However, results reflecting a small
number of outcomes have been found to strongly influence
estimates (28). Although we found statistically nonsignifi-
cant associations between smokeless tobacco use by males
and diseases of the endocrine and digestive systems and

statistically significant increases in all cancer and lung
cancer mortality among female smokeless tobacco users,
these results could be due to outcomes experienced by a
small number of subjects having large sample weights. The
association for all cancer among female smokeless tobacco
users was influenced by a small number of deaths at two sites
(three lung cancer deaths and two uterine cancer deaths
among smokeless tobacco users). Future studies, including
both male and female subjects, should be conducted to deter-
mine whether these associations with smokeless tobacco use
are causal.
Although the mortality rate among combined users was
higher than that expected from the individual rates, this
result is not likely due to a synergistic effect between smoke-
less tobacco and cigarettes. The combined users smoked
more than exclusive smokers did (42.3 and 35.1 mean pack-
years, respectively). The higher cigarette smoking dose, not
the use of smokeless tobacco, is likely leading to the
increased lung cancer mortality among combined users. A
possible explanation is that combined users may be strongly
addicted to nicotine and using smokeless tobacco in addition
to cigarettes rather than as a substitute for them.
The apparent lack of an effect among combined users for
ischemic heart disease mortality is counterintuitive.
Combined users smoked more than exclusive smokers did,
yet their ischemic heart disease mortality was less than that
of exclusive smokers. Combined users were more likely to
be former smokers than were exclusive smokers, possibly
accounting for the decreased risk found here.
Of the two oral cancer deaths among ever smokeless
tobacco users (both White males), one was a current smoker
and the other was a former smoker. However, these two
observed deaths were not more than expected in this cohort,
even when limiting the analysis to White males. In this
cohort, cigarette smoking was responsible for the increased
oral cancer mortality.
One limitation of this analysis is that the exposure cate-
gory is based only on ever use of smokeless tobacco. There-
fore, potential increases in mortality associated with current
versus former use could not be determined. Similarly, no
dose-response analysis could be done. Because of the lack of
information on lifetime use, subjects who used smokeless
tobacco once were categorized the same as those who used
smokeless tobacco many times.
Rouse (29) found that, among males who had ever tried
smokeless tobacco, 60 percent used it in the past year;
among females who had tried it, 42 percent used it in the past
year. She also found that, among those who reported any
lifetime use, 26 percent used it almost daily in the past year
(29). Therefore, it may be a reasonable assumption that
smokeless tobacco users in our study were not one-time
users, with many having used smokeless tobacco regularly.
Also, the restriction to subjects 45 years of age or more
created a homogeneous exposure group with respect to dura-
tion of smokeless tobacco use. The majority of smokeless
tobacco users initiate smokeless tobacco use prior to the age
of 18 years (30).
Tobacco categories represent self-reported responses, and
neither smokeless tobacco status nor smoking status was
biologically confirmed. Confounding variables were also
self-reported (e.g., alcohol intake, physical activity).
However, as this information was collected prospectively,
the potential for recall bias is much less than that found in
case-control studies.
Although this analysis was restricted to subjects 45­75
years of age at baseline to create more similar comparison
groups with respect to unknown and uncontrolled
confounders, residual or uncontrolled confounding (e.g.,
other tobacco habits or factors relating to survival) may
contribute to the results found in this study.
Because only a sample of individuals were asked about
their tobacco habits in NHANES I, the results from 1971 to
1975 were supplemented by information collected in the
1982­1984 NHEFS. This approach may have resulted in
some nondifferential misclassification of tobacco use, as
data from 1982­1984 may not be as accurate as those
collected in 1971­1975 (because of recall error or the use of
proxies for subjects who died between the baseline interview
and the initial follow-up). The expected effect would be a
bias toward the null hypothesis of no association. However,
as smokeless tobacco use is defined as only ever/never, this
effect should be minimal.
This analysis represents one of the most comprehensive
studies of the relation between smokeless tobacco use and
mortality. The 20-year follow-up period allowed ample time
to investigate common outcomes among smokeless tobacco
users in a representative US population. Available data on a
wide variety of risk factors allowed us to minimize the
potential for confounding as an explanation for any results.
Overall, we found no increased mortality for subjects who
reported ever smokeless tobacco use when compared with
subjects who reported no tobacco use. The few increases in
mortality that we discovered, although likely due to chance,
should be investigated further. Evidence from this study
shows that smokeless tobacco use is a safer alternative than
continued cigarette smoking. Mortality for exclusive smoke-
less tobacco users is considerably less than mortality for
exclusive smokers for all cancer (especially lung cancer) and
for ischemic heart disease. Further studies are needed to
determine whether regular smokeless tobacco use is appre-
ciably more harmful than ever use and to determine whether
there is increasing risk with increasing amount or duration of
use of smokeless tobacco products.
