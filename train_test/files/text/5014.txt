Introduction
Finland is one of Western Europe's most rural countries.
Compared with most other EU countries, the area of Finland
is large, and the population size is small (5.5 million people
in 2011). The distance from the capital city of Helsinki on the
south coast to the most north area in Lapland is 1,350 km, a
16-hr trip by car. As in many other EU countries, the process
of population concentration to some urban centers is ongo-
ing. Older people in the East and North Finland face quite
similar problems as those in the Northern Periphery areas of
other EU countries. Access to services is often poor for peo-
ple without their own cars; in East Finland, the distance to
the nearest shop can be close to 100 km and in the northern
part, it can be even further. Similar to other rural areas in
Europe, in Finland, old people without a car and with weak
local networks are in danger of being excluded from services
and social relationships and many activities outside their
nearest living environment (Davey, 2007; D. Gray, Shaw, &
Farrington, 2006). In those circumstances, the social situa-
tions of people with or without a car are very different. One
of the most important social differences between rural people
in remote areas is their travel possibilities (Tedre &
Pulkkinen, 2010).
This article is based on a research project in which our
interest focused on the life of retired people who remained
in, returned to, or moved to rural areas after retirement. In
Finland, many older people from remote, sparsely populated
countryside municipalities are drawn to urban centers by the
promise of better and more public social and health services
compared with those that they have access to in remote areas
(Tedre & Pulkkinen, 2010). Even if the trend of migration is
from rural to urban, there are also flows in the opposite direc-
tion. One of the groups moving from urban areas to rural
communities is retired people soon after retirement at
approximately 60 years of age (Kattilakoski, 2011; Pehkonen,
2009; Stockdale, 2004, 2006).
Phillipson (2000) summarized the way in which the idea
of "community" was reassessed within contemporary sociol-
ogy in the context of urbanization and globalization in the
1990s. In this article, we approach a rural village as a social
community. In a sparsely populated country, local villages
are quite scattered, without any concentration of population
around distinct centers. The number of inhabitants in Finnish
villages ranges from a small group of permanent inhabitants
to approximately 500 people. During the summer months,
the number of inhabitants will increase significantly. Our

Aging People as Communal Actors:
A Case Study in Rural Villages of East
Finland
Silva Tedre1 and Aini Pehkonen2
Abstract
This article discusses the variety of social activities of aging people in a community. The first aim of this study is to explore
how to overcome two dichotomies--public­private as spheres of everyday life and third­fourth age--and by overcoming
these, to make visible the personal social resources of older people, which are not usually recognized in policy discourses or
in social policy research. Second, we ask whether the problem-oriented rhetoric of aging in Finnish social and rural policy can
be challenged from the perspective of aging people's activities. The article analyzes older people as actors of a rural village
community and overcomes the two dichotomies mentioned above from the theoretical context of agency. In this research,
rural East Finland is a case with which to investigate social relationships between people. We suggest that seniors not only
participate in a variety of communal activities but also act in their homes, which are culturally coded as the territory of private
life. By "just being there," people also produce and reproduce rural communities in many ways. This is a form of action that
has been largely ignored by policies, policymakers, and social studies.

2 SAGE Open
study's approach to community was ethnographic in the
sense that the routines and normal aspects of everyday life
were regarded as worthy of consideration as research data;
the mundane and the ordinary parts of social life are per-
ceived as interesting, and the holistic approach stresses rela-
tionships, connections, and the interdependency among the
component parts. We focus on invisible action in homes and
informal social networks, but to obtain a holistic picture, we
start by introducing the other social activities of senior vil-
lagers, often reported in earlier studies concerning active or
productive aging.
In comparative studies of welfare states, Finland is usu-
ally classified as one of the Scandinavian (Nordic) welfare
states in which public services, provided by local authorities,
are widely available (Kröger, Anttonen, & Sipilä, 2003). The
"rural" question has always been at the top of the state
agenda. The Finnish government has implemented regional
policies since the 1960s that were specifically designed to
prevent regional disparities in wealth services and opportuni-
ties. Therefore, differences between urban and rural areas
with regard to income and living standards have been quite
small in Finland by international comparison. However, cur-
rently, the central problems relating to Finland's rural policy
have been identified as aging, loss of population, economic
underperformance, environmental degradation, and a
decrease in the number of jobs and services available. In
rural policy documents, aging is named as one of the main
problems of rural areas and the loss of social and health ser-
vices is perceived as a core problem for older rural people
(Tedre & Pulkkinen, 2010). According to Philo (1992), peo-
ple in rural areas might be "othered" or marginalized through
cultural practices in everyday life and particularly through
the social construction of identity and symbolic capital in
social and lay discourses. In the context of the sustained
movement out of rural villages, we search for dimensions of
communal action of older villagers by asking whether it is
possible to challenge the ways Finnish rural policy identifies
older villagers mainly through the individual problems they
face in the village or by perceiving them as a non-productive
group of the society or rural areas.
In the 1980s, the Swedish social gerontologist Lars
Tornstam (1982) introduced the idea of a resource perspec-
tive for social gerontology research. He emphasized older
people's importance as a labor force as well as a source of
voluntary work. Tornstam structured the arenas of action as
follows: market, labor market, neighborhood, policy, and lei-
sure. Later on, concepts such as productive aging (Bass &
Caro, 2001; Hinterlong, Morrow-Howell, & Sherraden,
2001; J. S. Jackson, 2001) or third age (Laslett, 1987)
included the idea that old people are useful to a society in one
way or another. This shows the varieties of activities of
elderly people and the positive economic, social, or personal
outcomes of those activities. These perspectives have also
been criticized (e.g., Estes, Biggs, & Phillipson, 2003)
because of their links with neo-liberalistic ideas of
effectiveness and independent initiative. Furthermore,
Laslett's (1987, 1991) conceptual division into the third and
fourth age constructs the age after retirement as a period free
for personal achievement to create forms of social collabora-
tion previously unknown. The fourth age, instead, is the age
of dependence and decrepitude. Laslett's dichotomy has
been criticized for treating the dependent people of the fourth
age as opposite to the independent, active elderly of the third
age.
In this article, we ask whether it is possible in the context
of rural communities to find social resources of older people
that have been unrecognized in earlier studies and in rural
policy. First, we will briefly review the literature relating to
community, a sense of community, and active agency in the
context of the public and private division. Next, we will pres-
ent the data, analysis, and ethical questions followed by an
explanation of the findings and finally a discussion of the
study's outcomes.
Villages as Interactive Communities
This article focuses on retired (60+) people as actors of rural
villages. We approach a rural village as a social community
that provides interactions between people, nature, and places.
A traditional division of communities presented by Tönnies
(1992) includes the concepts of Gemeinschaft and
Gesellschaft. Warm relationships and harmony among a
family and village are characteristic of a Gemeinschaft com-
munity. A Gesellschaft community, on the contrary, is
founded on egoistic and calculated relationships. According
to Lehtonen (1990), Gemeinschaft is a warm caregiving
community, whereas a Gesellschaft community is guided by
rationality. Furthermore, he states that the interpretation of a
Gemeinschaft community is a modern world's conception of
a community projected into pre-modern time in which the
negative features of a pre-modern community have been left
under the shadow of positive features. In this context, this
conception of community can be an interpretation with no
substance. Status communities (Gemeinschaft) were con-
nected to a family and relatives, whereas agreement commu-
nities (Gesellschaft) were based on the act of agreeing.
For his part, David Conway (1996) stated that a commu-
nity is any type of a group of individuals that shares a com-
mon life or a way of life, completely or partially. It associates
a natural value with that shared life or way of life, and is
aware that others in the group also associate in the same way.
The individuals of a group feel, or tend to feel, pronounced
respect for each other and cooperate, or tend to cooperate,
with each other to maintain and encourage a shared life or
way of life. Conway has taken the family, neighborhood or
closest living environment, nation, and state as more precise
research subjects of community forms. All of these tend to be
valued positively. At the same time, communities can be
cruel and harrowing in which different hierarchies compete
with each other. Nevertheless, individuals change,
Tedre and Pehkonen 3
communities change, and the relationships between the
members of the communities change all the time. (Murdoch,
2000).
When a community is translated broadly into a group for-
mation, it can be based on economic, political, or regional
factors. A common feature may be kinship, interests, beliefs,
common actions, interactions, hobbies, and so forth, and
communities can be categorized according to their objectives
and the nature of their interactions. In communities, there are
networks of social relationships that have contents of mean-
ing and values in common, but a community does not neces-
sarily have to be geographically clustered. In other words, a
community is formed by bonds between people, the strength
of which cannot be standardized. A community may also
function as an adhering environment, the fundamental fea-
ture of which is support. In this case, a community allows an
individual to be weak while providing chances to take
action--such that it becomes possible for the individual to
confront the things that threaten him or her (e.g., Winnicott,
1986). Common among these definitions and classifications
is a demonstrated sense of solidarity (Lehtonen, 1990, 1996)
as well as the need to defend a community for it to survive
(Bauman, 2002).
Granovetter (1973) divided social networks into continu-
ously maintained "strong bonds" characterized by intensive
communication, emotional intensity, and mutual trust, and
into "weak bonds" that are more distant and less frequently
maintained. Although paradoxical, weak social bonds are
nevertheless important from the perspective of social net-
works'structural capability to distribute information. Persons
with less frequently maintained social relationships move in
different fields of society, belong to different social reference
groups, and gain information about different things. There
are few responsibilities related to weak bonds. At a micro
level, weak bonds make the distribution of information eas-
ier and, at best, increase the opportunities for cooperation
between actors. Weak bonds are important for connecting
small groups and channeling the distribution of information.
The meaning of strong bonds is connected to commitments
between actors. Strong bonds primarily integrate their mem-
bers into a group, whereas weak bonds integrate individuals
into the society. Strong bonds are generally held as important
sources of social support in everyday life.
The concept of social support was introduced (e.g.,
Green, 1993) when explaining the connection between
becoming ill and changes in one's life. Social support has
many forms: practical help, appreciation, mental support,
and support based on knowledge. A social support provider
supports a person in need to a proper extent, as social support
can turn against itself if it becomes an experience of social
control.
According to Pehkonen (2009), a community expresses
its will through, for example, social control, by which it
hopes to regulate the behavior of its members. Doing right
from the viewpoint of a community can nevertheless entail
doing wrong on a personal level. Social pressure and pres-
sures of conformity and hierarchies are strongly linked to
rural villages and particularly to a peasant culture. People
belong to several communities at the same time (e.g., family,
work, study, place of residence, hobbies), each with its own
regulations and distribution of work and tasks. In this case,
the pressure of community-focused membership is distrib-
uted. In general, we move from one field to another smoothly,
but this does not remove the possibility of encountering role
conflicts. Communities' visible and invisible regulations are
present in different fields and are negotiable. Status and
expectations regarding the same person can be manifested in
different ways within the same day when an individual
moves from one community to another. An individual is
forced into a mobility of roles, even playing various roles
simultaneously in some cases. Role negotiations do not occur
in a social vacuum, and negotiations do not necessarily lead
to a shared mutual understanding. A pattern of behavior per-
ceived as suitable in a role situation can be considered unsuit-
able in the same individual's other relationships. Most
evidently, people living in a rural village quite often must
play different roles among the same people.
Communities and a sense of community are both stimu-
lating and controlling principles for individuation. They
reflect pluralism (Etzioni, 1995), a phenomenon through
which individuals as consumers and choosers search for
individual answers and choices in their lives (e.g., Roos,
1996). A moral community has been sought, for example,
from village communities, churches, and a civic society.
Morals bring people together through their emotional life.
On one hand, communities may be ignorant of the welfare of
their members, particularly in cases where the dimension of
welfare in question does not connect to the function of a
community. On the other hand, communities can easily be
close and loyal to their members, but their relationship to the
outside world may become problematic (e.g., Allardt, 1964;
Etzioni, 1997).
"Small Agency" in the Setting of
Community and Private Life
Anu Leinonen (2007) distinguished between three levels of
action: society and macro environment, communities and
organizations, and individual and personal. In this article, we
focus on the level of community as a place of residence and
the individual as a member of a community. Marja-Liisa
Honkasalo (2009) studied women's action in their village
homes and discusses "small agency." Small agency is hum-
ble and minimal if viewed through the usual social science
toolkit that considers the "act" or "agency." In fact, Honkasalo
wonders whether this type of agency can be conceptualized
as agency at all:
As basic notions, agency is considered intentional, individual,
rational, and normative, aiming at social change in some
4 SAGE Open
measurable sense.An actor--to be a proper actor--needs a goal-
oriented mind and the appropriate tools to achieve a rational
goal, mostly considered as a form of social transformation.
(Honkasalo 2009:p. 65).
Honkasalo studied women's enduring action in their
homes. Enduring action has a social dimension; it is social
and inter-subjective in that it takes place in close proximity
to others and is shared with them (Honkasalo, 2009; M.
Jackson, 1998). There are intermittent phases of passivity
and activity, reception and action: Women in the village
received the other's acts to be able to act. Sometimes, this
reception consisted of simply keeping oneself open. As
social actors, they could entrust themselves to their commu-
nity, indicating that they could sustain and draw strength
from one another. The many acts of a single person can have
repercussions for others not only in the sense of being addi-
tive or attenuating but also in the sense of dynamic
accumulation.
From the community perspective, action is similar to breathing,
a process of intermittent phases, where the acts of inhaling and
exhaling are equally necessary. The passive, receptive phase of
action is extremely important in this sense, but in social science
it is rarely thematised.(Honkasalo, 2009: p. 67).
There are two types of attachments that women create
through their agency. First, their activities are addressed to
repair and fasten social bonds that are in danger of becom-
ing weakened or broken. This bonding is created through
small everyday interactions, passive and active, with peo-
ple and among them. The second type of bond is a grip on
the world. Women's agency takes place without the power
of the ritual, in the context of everyday life (Honkasalo,
2009).
Honkasalo's theory emphasizes action in the context of
"home." The public­private split is among the most classic
themes of feminist theory. According to Marja Keränen
(1995), the ways we talk about things--ourselves, our lives,
society--are structured by the hidden spatialization of the
public and private. She argues that distinction works as a hid-
den metaphor that has been naturalized in the ways we think
about the world and structure our social reality.
Feminist scholars have argued that when the spheres
became diversified and autonomous, the family was forgot-
ten in the ways in which political science conceptualized the
social system. The family that was once a necessary part of
the social order was put in the position of external nature in
later interpretations. In political theory, family was relegated
to privacy. However, the family and the household remain
the "basic units of society" (Keränen, 1995). In addition,
Barnes, Newman, and Sullivan (2007) raised the question of
how diverse groups can be represented and how the public is
defined or constituted by officials. According to them, these
questions interact with notions of the competence, skills, and
practices of participations.
In this article, the community refers both to the common
public places of a village and the homes of people. Moreover,
it extends beyond the physical boundaries of the village
through social networks of people. "Home" as a physical
place of housing is culturally coded as private. Feminist
scholars have long noted that people who are restricted to the
private realm have no place in the realm of life that extends
beyond the private sphere of friends and family (Tronto,
1993). Like early feminist scholars, we suggest that action in
the sphere of the home is not strictly private. Actions are also
reproduced in the community in many ways that are often
self-evident. We join the feminist tradition, which criticizes
the way social theories understand the home as private and
opposite to the public sphere. Age and functional ability can
also discursively exclude people from the discussions of
community and society.
Data and Analysis
This article is based on several sets of ethnographic field-
work carried out in East Finland by the authors during 2009-
2010 as part of a research project on rural areas, funded by
the Finnish Rural Policy Committee.
The focus of the study project was the permanent inhabit-
ants of rural areas outside the population center and their
social networks inside and outside the place of residence. We
asked what type of structural barriers and possibilities there
are for old people to continue living in rural areas and in
"homes" in circumstances of centralization and urbanization
within Finnish society. The study project has been reported
earlier from three perspectives. The first article dealt with the
municipal social care policy of old age from the perspective
of villages. The second article focused on the questions of
opportunities for mobility, and the third one was interested in
the community as a resource for older people living in nurs-
ing homes. In the present article, we focus on older people as
a resource for the community.
The two-step qualitative data collection started with face-
to-face interviews with six old-age pensioners who were
known as active organizers of their own village in two prov-
inces, Kainuu and North Karelia, in East Finland. In addi-
tion, three organizers were interviewed by e-mail and phone.
Most of the nine organizers were village leaders. We also
analyzed the reports of LEADER projects (88) carried out in
a province in 2009. The aim of this phase was to find out the
organized activities of older rural people and to choose a case
village for actual fieldwork that enables us to search for the
non-organized activities and, small agency, of senior villag-
ers. The village that was chosen for fieldwork is situated in
North Karelia. During the fieldwork, the main methods for
collecting data were observation and discussions with inhab-
itants of the case village. Researchers visited the village sev-
eral times during years 2009-2010. The data consist of
fieldwork diaries, transcribed interviews of active organizers
(6), e-mail discussions with three more organizers, and the
Tedre and Pehkonen 5
project reports of LEADER projects (88). In addition, two
informants wrote an account of the everyday lives of their
elderly relatives in the village.
The informants in the study ranged in age from 65 to 90
years in the period 2008-2010, when the study was carried
out. Some of the informants had lived in the same village
throughout their lives. Most of them, however, had moved to
the village during their adult life, in some cases after retire-
ment, whereas others were returnees. The variety of their
lifestyles illustrates the variety and heterogeneity of retired
people. Seniors in the study lived alone, with a spouse, or
with their children's family in detached houses. Some of
them lived in a nursing home. One of the main ideas of the
study was to suppose that communal social resources of
retired people can be found everywhere, for example, in
nursing homes. From this perspective, we ignored people's
potential need for social care and avoided the context of
social and health care when interpreting data. We wanted to
overcome not only the conceptual split of the public and pri-
vate sphere but also the split of the third and fourth age.
The interviews with active organizers were carried out in
the provinces of Kainuu and North Karelia, situated on the
northeast edge of EU, close to the Finnish­Russian border.
The provinces have approximately 24,000 inhabitants and
their average population density is 3.8 persons/km2. The sec-
ond phase of the study, fieldwork, was carried out in a village
in North Karelia. We had numerous informal discussions
with villagers and participated in village events there and in
the neighborhood. We also visited older people's homes,
including a small private nursing home that was situated in
the village. Moreover, we traveled by the local taxi "car-
pool," which was a development project of the municipality
aimed at ensuring that people without a car had access to the
city center once a week.
In terms of net migration, the municipality where the case
study village is situated is one of the most affected munici-
palities in North Karelia. The population of the municipality
was 13,700 inhabitants at the beginning of 2005, but fewer
than 12,700 at the beginning of 2010. The average popula-
tion density in the municipality in 2006 was 3.78 persons/
km2. In 1980, the proportion of the population above 65
years was 12.5%, whereas in 2006, that figure was 24.8%.
The municipality also has one of the highest median ages in
Finland, and it is estimated that the proportion of people
above the ages of 75 and 85 will continue to increase signifi-
cantly until 2040.
The research approach can be illustrated through the met-
aphor of a traveler; the interviewer­traveler wanders through
the landscape and enters into conversation with the people
encountered. He or she wanders along with the local inhabit-
ants and asks questions that lead the subjects to tell their own
stories of their lived world. The meaning in the original sto-
ries is differentiated and unfolded through the traveler's
interpretations (Kvale, 1996). The study is a construction,
not a literal photograph of the situation in question. We were
interested in seniors as a group as well as the variety of their
lifestyles, actions, and social situations. We aimed to produce
"thick" descriptions (Geertz, 1973) of a village community
from the perspective of pensioners. The descriptions must
remain close to the concrete reality but must also reveal the
general features of human social life (Hammersley &
Atkinson, 1995).
In the study, when collecting data, the case village was
defined administratively according to the relevant village
action committees. Since the mid-1970s, a large number of
village committees have formed, and in 2011, there were 120
village action committees across North Karelia, all based on
voluntary village activity. According to the rural policy strat-
egy of North Karelia, the main idea of those committees is to
develop the village and the surrounding countryside (Pohjois-
Karjalan Kyläohjelma 2014, 2012). For this article, we
mainly use fieldwork diaries during visits in the case village.
The in-depth thematic interviews with the active organizers
of villages are also used.
Active senior organizers were located for interviews with
the help of LEADER organizations in East Finland. Every
executive manager of an organization could easily name one
or more active, regionally well-known seniors above 65
years of age. For the study, we selected nine seniors, of both
sexes and different backgrounds, including returnees, new-
comers, and people who had lived in the village their whole
adult lives. Some of them had bought a small, old house and
moved from the city after redecorating the house. Some had
built a new house in a rural area for their retirement years.
One woman moved to the village as a young wife after mar-
riage with a farmer, and they currently live in a small house
in the same barnyard with their daughter's family, who are
now responsible for the farm. Four of interviewees were
divorced and remarried; five others were married with their
first spouse. Every couple has children and grandchildren.
The village in which the latter fieldwork was carried out
is situated approximately 40 km from the center of the
municipality. The nearest shop (as well as other services
including social and health care services) is situated in the
center. Buses no longer travel there, the school was closed
about 10 years ago, and the latest shop was closed a year ago.
The number of permanent inhabitants is approximately 400,
and there is an energetic local village action committee. The
village mostly survives off tourism revenues; it is located on
a lake, and Finnish national landscape is situated opposite
the lake. Because of tourism, the age structure of the village
is younger than in neighboring villages. A nursing home is
also located in this village. A nursing home in a village is
quite an unusual solution for care services because the policy
of municipalities with long inner distances is typically to
concentrate the services for older people in the city center.
The nursing home was a small private unit of nine resi-
dents and six care workers. We visited it several times during
the year and spoke with residents and care professionals.
Four of the nine residents were interviewed. We wanted to
6 SAGE Open
know about their social bonds in the village and what the
meaning of this special village was for them. We also met
their relatives when they visited. It turned out that one of the
residents did not have any other social bonds in the village,
except a daughter and her family. The place as such was not
important to her, whereas for the other three people, the vil-
lage was essential and meaningful. They had strong bonds
with the village, its nature, culture, and people. The village as
such was a resource for them even if they did not move out-
side the nursing home or no longer had relatives there (Tedre
& Pehkonen, 2011).
The setting of our study is a village. In terms of
Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft, the village is both a status
community of family, friends, and relatives and an agree-
ment community with an official village action committee. It
is the closest living environment of permanent inhabitants.
"The village community" as a concept includes both social
and physical space, the boundaries of which are continuously
changing (Massey, 1995). The village as a community is thus
changing at every moment. For example, the winter commu-
nity differs from the summer community because of the con-
siderable amount of summer residences and leisure residents
(Mauss & Beuchat, 1979).
Doreen Massey (1995) critiqued the notion of place as a
secure haven that is culturally coherent and bounded.
Instead, she demonstrates that the identities of places them-
selves are in part the product of a long history of connec-
tions with other places beyond one's own. For Massey,
places are essentially open and porous, and are the products
of links with other places rather than exclusive enclosures
sealed off from the outside world. In this article, a village is
understood as a place connected with other places. At the
same time, it is a community of people who occasionally or
permanently live in a specific geographical place with their
networks, which overcome the specific place. This article
focuses on the permanent inhabitants of the village
community.
Aging people in a rural village were not a homogeneous
group in relation to their commitment to the village. On the
contrary, their connections and attitudes to the village com-
munity varied in accordance with their lifestyles, social sta-
tus, and life courses. Leena Vuorinen (2009) also examined
the everyday life of older inhabitants in a small village and
constructed the concept of four different ways of life. In her
study, the traditional way of life is based on continuity and
hard work; the family-oriented way of life is based on family
members and relatives; the mobile way of life is character-
ized by symbolic and concrete mobility; and the fourth way
of life was named by Vuorinen as the novel way of life,
which the community considered strange, and is marked by
independent loneliness. Similarly, the strength of bonds
between people in the village community cannot be stan-
dardized. This variety of social bonds also concerns the
elderly in nursing homes.
Ethical Questions
With respect to ethical considerations, the focus was placed
on issues of privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality. In addi-
tion, respondents were informed that their answers were con-
fidential and that the findings would be reported in such a
way that anonymity would be ensured. In this study, this
means that the names of people have been changed and the
locations of fieldwork are presented on a general level with-
out exact names.
Findings
Social Resources
The interviews with active senior organizers in East Finland
villages of this study, as is the case with many former studies,
indicated that retired people formed a notable social resource
for the rural community in their many roles as volunteers.
They acted as line managers and as other voluntary workers
of rural development projects, as well as in various country-
side organizations. Within the role of managers of develop-
ment projects, they used their former occupational knowledge
as well as their professional or political networks. They had
strong skills in leading local development projects and offer-
ing novel ideas, all the while encouraging, stimulating, and
completing project applications and evaluation reports, gath-
ering people together, organizing volunteer work and even
acting as volunteers themselves. In accordance with Putnam's
(2000) idea of social capital, they sustained the public good,
ensuring that people share values and that the mutual trust of
community members was available to everyone. Ties
between individuals, and particularly voluntary cooperation
within formal associations, helped to increase social capital
in the community as a whole. As Murdoch (2000) puts it
when discussing social capital, the actions of people, includ-
ing those among whom we carry out research, are inherently
social and performed, continually placed within networks of
social relations The attitudes and actions of people are mean-
ingful in themselves, acting out the sociality (the social pro-
cess) that is often sought at the level of the community.
Some of the projects were "blue-sky projects" involving,
for example, building an observatory in a village. Some of
the retired developers interviewed for the study participated
in almost every action on many levels concerning the vil-
lage's development. Some respondents outlined activities
through which they believed their special skills would be
most useful for the village. Those people were perceived as
"active villagers, as a part of community--on their own con-
ditions" (organizer, woman, 68). The organizer chooses what
to do and with whom to associate (Bourdieu, 1986).
Every organizer we met seemed to be a recognized and
notable resource for the village, in some cases for the munic-
ipality and more broadly as well. They were aware of their
responsibility for the future of the village. They identified the
Tedre and Pehkonen 7
responsibility to society based on reciprocity as the most
important among their various motives. In doing so, they can
share the knowledge, skills, and experiences obtained during
their lifetime. For them, the success and affluence of the vil-
lage was in the common interest of every villager; the inter-
ests of the village can thus rise above individual interests.
In addition to the active organizers, many other senior vil-
lagers participated in common activities of their own village,
such as "talkoot" as well as various other forms of voluntary
work. "Talkoot" is a traditional rural community action, a
form of volunteer work based on norms of solidarity and
communality. Common action usually focuses on concrete,
short-period work performed for one family or for the com-
munity as whole. In agriculture, it was the norm that at least
one member of every family would participate in talkoot.
Typical works were, for instance, haymaking and roofing. As
a return gift, food and drink were served to participants.
In our village, too, the older volunteer workers are 78 years old.
Older people never complain, that they should get some
compensation (get some payment). (senior organizer, man, 67)
According to active organizers, talkoot was both a form of
socializing and reproducing the social cohesion of commu-
nity. Moreover, talkoot was rational, goal-oriented action.
"You should achieve some tangible results there (in talkoot)
and you must every time have good serving and you must
know when to stop before it becomes too hard to continue"
(senior organizer, man, 76). The emotional community
becomes visible in talkoot and reproduces community by
strengthening the overall sense of community. "Talkoot is a
kind of social action--it is important to be present, involved
in talkoot, not necessarily that you work hard. It is a sense of
solidarity and emotional togetherness" (senior organizer,
man, 70).
The new retired villagers brought new resources such as
knowledge, social networks, skills, and labor. We analyzed
social capital outcomes as a dynamic relationship, taking
into account the volunteer work performed and viewing the
villagers as actors rather than simply as members of the vil-
lage. Their action increases the social capital in the village.
Just as A. Gray (2009) concluded, supportive friendship may
arise from participatory activities.
The participation in talkoot is visible action that the com-
munity appreciates. In addition to talkoot, older people per-
formed a great deal of other volunteer work. They kept up
club activities and participated as members of numerous
associations. In many cases, they took on a strong responsi-
bility for a certain neighbor's well-being. At times, their
responsibility and bond were so strong that it was difficult to
refer to it as "neighborly help" or "voluntary work," which is
based on equality. Small degrees of help had sometimes
become quite large over time. The idea of reciprocity
(Coleman, 1988) is thus no longer fulfilled. It would seem
that, in genuinely communal neighborhoods, residents
support and view each other in a civilized way and develop
goodwill toward one another. A neighborhood seems to form
people's conceptions of their neighbors regardless of whether
they actively rub shoulders with them. Symbolic interaction,
social interaction, and the act of individuals bonding with
other people and places belong to a neighborhood and neigh-
borly relationships (Unger & Wandersman, 1985).
Senior villagers as transformers of cultural heritage as
well as transformers of occupational and other knowledge
also became recognized through this research. In particular,
their experiential, practical, and local knowledge was used.
On a practical level, they advised leisure residents on how to
adapt to unpredictable road conditions or how to behave on
the lake in different circumstances during the four seasons.
They also told newcomers about the social history of the
village.
The former retired villagers who had moved from the vil-
lage to population centers took part in village events, espe-
cially in the summertime. By participating, they reproduced
their emotional bond as members of the local community. At
the same time, they strengthened the social bonds between
present and former residents. In the summertime, the village
community expands because of the summer residents, and
many of them are retired people as well. All of these people
may reproduce social cohesion in the community by their
personal, non-material investments into the community
(Hanifan, 1916).
Unrecognized Resources
The organized action described above as a form of common
action is quite easy to interpret as a part of the social capital
creation within a village community and is also relatively
easy to analyze in the context of rural development or pro-
ductive aging. One of the main aims of our study was to rec-
ognize communal forms of not so clearly identified action,
"small agency"--as Honkasalo (2009) called it. Seniors who
no longer participate in common action also live in the vil-
lage. We did not meet them at all outside their own houses.
However, we could visit a few of them when some of their
relatives asked them to permit our visit. Not everyone wanted
to meet the foreign researchers, but often, some of their
younger relatives told us about their everyday lives. As per-
manent inhabitants of the village, those older people also
reproduce the community through various forms of small
agency in their homes or even in the nursing home in the
village.
Older villagers reproduce the social community by just
being there, by their simple presence in the place, and by
being villagers. Many of them followed local newspapers or
were otherwise interested in what was happening in the vil-
lage. If they do not participate in the village actions, they
become invisible in the context of the community in the
sense that other villagers did not recognize their presence as
active participants of community. We researchers came from
8 SAGE Open
outside the community and could find aspects of small com-
munal activity that were too self-evident for the villagers
themselves to recognize.
For instance, Marja and Seppo Järvinen, a couple above
80 years old, lived in Marja's birthplace in a small house that
Seppo built in the 1960s. The families of their five children
live in the southern part of Finland or abroad. By living in the
village, Marja and Seppo offered their children and grand-
children a place to stay during the children's leisure time. At
the same time, they offered the former generations the pos-
sibility to reproduce their village community ties. Järvinen's
home was also a place that summer residents visited when
they needed knowledge about local circumstances or practi-
cal skills, which were especially necessary in the country-
side. It was also a place for researchers to collect information
about the village. In terms of human capital, Marja and
Seppo had skills and capabilities that make newcomers act in
new ways (Coleman, 1988).
Another example, Maija and Matti Hassinen, a sister and
brother both above 70 years of age, also lived in their birth-
place. Almost everyone in the village knew them, although
they did not move in the village anymore after the shop was
closed. Their family has lived in the place as farmers for
three generations. Their five siblings who live outside the
village visit regularly; one reason for the visits was to take
care of Maija and Matti. At the same time, they reproduced
their own relationship with their birthplace and village.
During fieldwork, we discovered many repeated everyday
actions, "matter of course" actions, which following the
ideas of Honkasalo (2009), can be interpreted as small com-
munity agency. Elderly people took care of their garden or
yard and the buildings--sometimes with their relatives--and
felt responsible for their environment and surroundings.
Their actions in the context of home reproduce the village in
visible and also in quite invisible, culturally self-evident
ways.
We also included the inhabitants of the nursing home as
members of the village community. In Finnish rural policy,
aging villagers who need social care are mostly observed as
"others" who need services, especially if they live in residen-
tial institutions. They are no longer viewed as members of
the village community. Our discussions with the nursing
home inhabitants indicated that for several reasons, the vil-
lage--not just the nursing home--was an important social
context for them (Tedre & Pehkonen, 2011). However, in
contrast, the nursing home with its inhabitants was important
for the village community. Neither of these two viewpoints is
recognized in Finnish rural policy or social policy. The
importance of the nursing home was also a self-evident,
"matter of course" for villagers outside the nursing home.
Thus, the nursing home formed a part of the village's institu-
tional structure similar to the village shop and the tourism
enterprise. It was the biggest employer in the village, and
people nearby knew the nursing home and some of their rela-
tives lived or had lived in it. As such, the nursing home's
residents formed a part of the emotional social community.
Moreover, the nursing home was a social arena for villagers
to meet occupants of the nursing home, as well as each other.
In addition, some senior villagers of the nursing home repre-
sented a living history of the village. For us as researchers,
some of them turned out to be key informants of village life,
even if they had problems remembering short-term details.
Discussion
Urbanization and the growth of the aging population are
some of the most important ongoing social trends in the
world. The consequences of urbanization are reflected in
rural areas, where the process of communities' aging is often
the most rapid due to depopulation and out-migration from
rural to urban areas. The political discussions concerning the
consequences of rural aging are largely problem-oriented,
and/or the role of seniors in social change is unclear. In this
context, retired people are often invisible, or they exist in
social studies and political discussions mainly in the context
of economic productivity, the family, or through the need for
care, often on a structural institutional level through the lack
of sufficient public social and health care services for them.
This structural "care service approach" is especially empha-
sized in the "Nordic welfare states," including Finland, with
its traditionally strong public sector responsibility in terms of
social and health care services. Local authorities are afraid
that public services, and the structures for providing them--
welfare structures that have been built over several decades--
are being endangered by the approach of market liberation.
The discussion emphasizes the withdrawal of services in the
countryside and focuses on the problems of rural residents.
In this context, "the elderly" are perceived through their
needs, not as actors in their community.
The ways in which we discuss and categorize members of
a community can exclude people, for instance, retired peo-
ple, and, if not everyone, most evidently the people who no
longer participate in common local activities in concrete
ways. The aim of this article was, first, to challenge the prob-
lem-oriented approach to rural aging through a resource per-
spective by asking about the types of social resources that
seniors have in their local communities in the Finnish rural
context. The local community is not merely a group of indi-
viduals but also a group that cooperates in various ways and
personally shares varying aspects of common life. It is a
moral community whose senior members feel a responsibil-
ity for the continuation and development of their community.
Conceptually, a rural community in this article is an area that
is geographically clustered and also contains a network of
social relationships that go far beyond its geographical
boundaries.
Instead of viewing senior rural residents through their
own needs, in the context of their own social networks or
"just" as members of the community, we approach them as
social actors and resources in the common life of the
Tedre and Pehkonen 9
community. The older members of the community are not all
actors in a similar way. Many of them have visible roles in
several communal tasks, as reported in many earlier studies.
People who strive toward "just being there" are most evi-
dently excluded from the idea of being actors in the commu-
nity setting. Therefore, second, by applying the concept of
small agency, we challenge the social theories' meanings of
agency as rational and goal-oriented, and aimed at social
change in some measurable sense. Small agency refers to
enduring action with intermittent phases of passivity and
activity and reproduction and action. The passive and recep-
tive phase of actions is important. The concept of small
action also offers a tool with which to analyze and interpret
the communal dimensions of action in the context of home
and informal, non-organized settings.
The case study of this article, rural East Finland and a vil-
lage with few inhabitants, is a small unit that offers a field in
which to identify communal ties, networks, and social
resources through an ethnographic research approach. As a
result of the study, we find that, in circumstances of urban-
ization, seniors in rural communities form a significant force
that both remolds and reproduces the community. They often
feel strong responsibility for the future of their own residen-
tial area and share a common life through a common com-
mitment to their surroundings.
The village community is simultaneously caregiving and
rational. On one hand, visible and noticeable social action
shapes and changes the community. On the other hand,
everyday activities and culturally self-evident action keep
the community alive. The latter can be characterized by
repetitive and practical daily action without a clear aim to
change anything; as such, it can be completely overlooked
by the community, as well as by rural and social policy or
research. Older villagers' community responsibility is
expressed in concrete and symbolic ways.
In the context of small agency, we separate some dimen-
sions of action. The dimensions are not extensive but rather
a preliminary experiment to offer the role of actor to those
older community members who, usually in Finnish studies,
have been studied as clients in the institutional context of
welfare services. One of those dimensions is existence, being
there and, as such, being a part of the community. Another
dimension is their function to repair and fasten the social
bonds of former villagers to the village community, for
instance, by informing them of important events in the vil-
lage and keeping their homes ready for adult children to visit.
The third dimension is the role of mediator, for instance, by
mediating local knowledge for newcomers. The fourth
dimension addresses their relationship to their environment.
They may act as caretakers of the environment through prac-
tical, concrete action at home and on their properties.
The community is constructed in people's everyday lives.
Much everyday action happens in people's homes, which are
culturally coded as part of the private sphere and are there-
fore excluded from the analysis of the community. Everyday
action also continues in nursing homes, which are often
observed as segregated units outside their social environ-
ment. This exclusion constructs the ways we think about
community actions and in turn structures our social reality. A
community may function as an adhering environment in
which the characterizing feature is that of support.
In conclusion, we suggest that although, from the per-
spective of rural communities, ongoing macro-level social
processes such as urbanization, depopulation, market liber-
alization, centralization, and their consequent withdrawal
of services all bring essential social problems to the context
of rural community, remote-area communities not only try
to survive but also search for new ways to develop. In addi-
tion, in Nordic countries, the responsibility of the public
sector for welfare care services has been strong for decades
and has also reached fringe areas. This has been especially
true in Finland, where the municipality instead of the state
has been the main actor with the responsibility for services.
In circumstances where public institutional structures are
becoming sparser, the role of community actors grows. A
significant portion of the community actors are older,
retired people who act for the community in several often
unidentified and unrecognized ways. This perspective is
underestimated in political discussions and even in actor-
based social studies of rural areas. Paying attention to
"small agency" enlarges the scope for more adequately rec-
ognizing how older people may make a contribution to
society.
