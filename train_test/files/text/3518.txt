Introduction
Self-esteem is defined as the individual's assessment of self-
worth (Rosenberg, 1965) and is affected both by our ideas
about how we are measuring up to our own standards (i.e.,
primarily internal) and by our ability to control our sense of
self in interactions with others (i.e., primarily external); both
these processes have important repercussions on our feelings
about ourselves (Bordens & Horowitz, 2008). People with
high self-esteem regard themselves highly and are generally
pleased with who they are (Bordens & Horowitz, 2008). They
tend to have positive, well-anchored, and secure feelings of
self-worth and are satisfied with themselves (Kernis, 2000).
They are better at making new friends, at communicating
about themselves, at providing emotional support to others,
and at resolving interpersonal conflicts (Buhrmester, Furman,
Wittenberg, & Reis, 1988). In contrast, feelings of failure,
incompetence, and worthlessness are common characteristics
of people with low self-esteem (Bordens & Horowitz, 2008).
People with low self-esteem evaluate themselves negatively,
which increases the proneness toward feelings of being weak,
helpless, hopeless, frightened, vulnerable, fragile, incom-
plete, worthless, and inadequate. Consciously or uncon-
sciously low self-esteem causes patients or others to hate and
reject themselves, which may be expressed in direct or indi-
rect ways (Stuart & Sundeen, 1987).
The past few decades have seen an increase in the research
on self-esteem deficits and their debilitating effects among
psychiatric patients. Research on self-esteem deficit and its
paralyzing effects among psychiatric populations has already
provided a great deal of insight into this phenomenon.
According to O'Brien, Bartoletti, and Leitzel (2006), among
patients with psychiatric disorders or mental illnesses, low
self-esteem is either a diagnostic criterion or an associated
feature of nearly two dozen mental disorders in Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text
rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association [APA],
2000). Research evidence recognizes low self-esteem to
occur in several psychiatric disorders, particularly major
depressive disorders, dysthymic disorder, anxiety disorders,

Self-Esteem Deficits Among Psychiatric
Patients

Abstract
The objective of the present study was to investigate the difference in the level of self-esteem among patients with psychiatric
disorders and normal controls. After a detailed literature review, it was hypothesized that there would be a significant
difference in the level of self-esteem among patients with psychiatric disorders and normal controls. The sample of the
present study consisted of 260 participants, who were further divided into two groups: clinical group (n = 140) and normal
controls (n = 120). The age range of the participants in both the samples were 18 to 25 years (with the mean age of 22.14
years for psychiatric patients and 21.18 years for normal controls), and they belonged to middle socioeconomic status. The
clinical group consisted of diagnosed psychiatric patients according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th
ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR) criteria and further divided into four subgroups, including patients of (a) schizophrenia (n = 40),
(b) major depressive disorder (n = 40), (c) obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 40), and (d) opioid dependence disorder (n =
20). The semi-structured interview form of Institute of Clinical Psychology, University of Karachi, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Scale were used. Descriptive Statistics and one-way ANOVA were applied to analyze and interpret the data in statistical
terminology. Results indicate significant differences among patients with psychiatric disorders and normal controls on the
variable of self-esteem (F = 30.513, df = 4, 255, p< .05). The finding has implications for clinical interventions and also suggests
avenues for future research.

eating disorders, sexual dysfunction, and personality disor-
ders (Leary & MacDonald, 2003), schizophrenia (Lysaker,
Roe, & Yanos, 2007; Gureje, Harvey, & Herrman, 2004),
obsessive-compulsive disorder (Fava, Savron, Rafanelli,
Grandi, & Canestrari, 1996; Stumpf & Parker, 2000), and
opioid dependence disorder (Frances & Franklin, 1988) in
young adults. This fundamental importance of self-esteem in
the course of various disorders is still inviting the attention of
researchers due to its significance and implications.
There is also a controversy that swirls around the rela-
tive impact of self-esteem and psychiatric illnesses on each
other. Some researchers argue that self-esteem deficit
makes individuals vulnerable to psychiatric illnesses (see
Khanam, Rizwan, & Bilal, 2008), and some suggest that
psychiatric illnesses lessen one's level of self-esteem (see
Steinhausen, 2005), while others argue that there is a
vicious cycle between low self-esteem and psychiatric ill-
nesses (see Silverstone & Salsali, 2003). The present study
is an effort to highlight the relative presence of self-esteem
deficits in psychiatric patients compared with normal con-
trols. This comparative analysis is not only limited to a spe-
cific diagnostic classification and its controls; instead, it
considers a number of diagnostic groups under this analy-
sis, which adds to its significance and makes it distinctive
to previous studies. The inclusion of multiple groups (i.e.,
participants from patients of schizophrenia, major depres-
sive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and opioid
dependence disorder) not only makes the study sample
more representative of the psychiatric population, but also
makes intergroup comparisons possible, which add to the
study's credibility. On the basis of literature, it was hypoth-
esized that there would be a significant difference in the
level of self-esteem among patients with psychiatric disor-
ders and normal controls.
Method
Sample
The sample of this study consisted of 260 participants,
including (a) clinical group, and (b) normal controls group
(For demographics see Table 3 & 4). The clinical group con-
sisted of 140 participants, who had been taking treatment for
their mental health problems from outpatient clinics of dif-
ferent psychiatric and psychological settings within urban
areas of Karachi, Pakistan. They were diagnosed psychiatric
patients according to DSM-IV-TR; APA, 2000) criteria,
including patients of (a) schizophrenia (n = 40), (b) major
depressive disorder (n = 40), (c) obsessive-compulsive disor-
der (n = 40), and (d) opioid dependence disorder (n = 20).
The participants of the opioid dependence disorder group
were comprised of males only because of the unavailability
of females with opioid dependence disorder in outpatient
clinical setups in Karachi.
Normal controls consisted of 120 participants who them-
selves or their first-degree relatives had never experienced
any kind of psychological problem that demanded clinical
attention or consultancy from mental health professionals.
Participants for the control group were drawn from different
institutions and organizations in Karachi.
The ages of the participants in both samples ranged from
18 to 25 years, with a mean age of 22 years for psychiatric
patients and 21 years for normal controls (see Table 1 & 2).
The entire sample was drawn from the middle socioeco-
nomic class, and the minimum education level was Middle
(eighth grade).
Measures
Semi-structured interview form. The semi-structured interview
form is a qualitative tool designed by the Institute of Clinical
Psychology (ICP), University of Karachi, to use in Out
patient Department(OPD). It consisted of items focusing on
an individual's demographic information, presenting prob-
lems, history of problem, medical history, family history,
educational history, social and occupational history, recre-
ational activities, sexual history, mental state examination,
extrasensory perceptions, belief system, affective state, anxi-
eties, gender identity problems, psychosomatic complaints,
addiction problems, family psychopathology, personality
traits, motivation, and behavior during interview. It is not a
standardized measure, but a practice tool to get qualitative
information from patients, and it usually takes 20 to 30 min-
utes to be administered.
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES).The RSES (Rosenberg,
1965) is a 10-item scale that was originally designed to mea-
sure global self-esteem. It uses the 4-point Likert-type
response format: strongly agree, agree, disagree, and
strongly disagree. The scores can range from 0 to 30, with
the higher scores indicating a high level of self-esteem and
lower scores indicating a low level of self-esteem. In the
present study, a translated version (in Urdu) of the RSES
(Sardar, 1998) was used. Cronbach's alpha was found to be
.71 for the clinical sample and .75 for the normal controls,
which indicates adequate internal consistency of the Urdu
RSES.
Research procedure.This research was conducted after
approval of research review board in ICP, University of
Karachi. The sample for the clinical group was recruited
from different psychiatric departments and mental health
clinics within urban areas of Karachi. A letter of consent
describing the research project was provided to authorities
of selected organizations. After getting permission from
authorities, the psychiatric patients were approached indi-
vidually with the help of their respective psychiatrists and
psychologists who had already been treating them. The
Rizwan and Ahmad 3
initial few minutes were spent putting the patients at ease,
and then the purpose of the study was briefed and discussed
in very general terms. The researcher assured the confiden-
tiality of the participant's personal information and
responses. The formal consent was taken from patients
through a consent form, and only those patients who gave
consent to participate were included in the sample. First,
the researcher conducted a detailed diagnostic interview
and recorded all necessary information about each partici-
pant's illness on the Semi-Structured Interview Form,
which was utilized to confirm the diagnosis made by the
respective psychiatrist/psychologist according to the diag-
nostic criteria of DSM-IV-TR(APA, 2000). The participants'
final diagnosis was determined by a consensus meeting
between the researcher, respective psychiatrist/psycholo-
gist, and an expert clinician's opinion.
Finally, the RSES was administered to assess the psychi-
atric patients' level of self-esteem. Participants were allowed
to ask questions if they had any difficulty in following
instructions and understanding the statements. At the end of
the administration of research measures, psychiatric patients
and concerned authorities were thanked for their cooperation
and time.
The sample for normal controls was drawn from different
institutions and organizations in Karachi. The same proce-
dure that was applied to the clinical group was followed for
the normal controls. They were individually interviewed to
assess them as controls for the study (e.g., age, marital status,
education), and they were requested to respond on the RSES.
During the process of study, the researcher adhered to four
key ethical principles: respect for the person's rights and dig-
nity, responsibility, and integrity.
Statistical analysis. After scoring, the research data were ana-
lyzed to interpret them in statistical terminology. Data were
initially compiled into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and
then analyzed on Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS, V-13.0) software. To test the hypotheses of the pres-
ent study, one-way ANOVA was computed.

with schizophrenia (MD = 3.983, p < .05), major depressive disorder
(MD = 9.608, p < .05), obsessive-compulsive disorder (MD = 7.683, p <

to score significantly lower, indicating low self-esteem in all types of
psychiatric patients, compared with normal controls.
depressive disorder (MD = 9.608, p< .05), obsessive-com-

significantly lower, indicating low self-esteem in all types of
psychiatric patients, compared with normal controls in this
study.
The value we assign to ourselves is generally based on
five factors--two physical and three psychological. The
physical factors that determine our self-esteem are our
appearance (the way we look) and our physical abilities. The
psychological determinants of self-esteem are how well we
do (our perceived intelligence), how confident we are in
social situations, and how we regard ourselves (Rice, 1987).
However, Strickland (2001) described that psychologists
who write about self-esteem generally discuss it in terms of
two key components: the feeling of being loved or lovable
and accepted by others and a sense of competence and mas-
tery in performing tasks and solving problems independently.
In psychiatric patients, generally both components (i.e., feel-
ing of being loved or lovable and accepted by others) are
impaired and manifest as deficiency of self-esteem. As Berk,
Macneil, Castle, and Berk (2008) described, that insight into
reality that one has a severe mental illness may be associated
with a fall in self-esteem and demoralization. He further
extended that diagnosis by saying that denial may be a way
of protecting oneself from the cognitive dissonance experi-
enced when trying to integrate the idea of a stigmatized ill-
ness with one's usual self-concept. This might also be a
reason for patients with psychiatric disorders to, when they
become aware of their illness, spontaneously respond to their
illness with denial; and that when they accept their illness,
they become prone to negatively evaluate themselves. As
Sanyal (2008) suggested, psychiatric patients can believe
that they are less smart than other people, and this can
adversely affect their self-esteem and reinforce isolation. In
this way, people with psychiatric illnesses do not trust them-
selves; they view themselves as awful people who are poor
in all aspects of life compared with others. They not only
perceive that they lack confidence in themselves and their
ability to control their lives but also that they are socially
inapt. Thus, their psychiatric disorder limits their coping
mechanisms, and impairs their problem-solving and deci-
sion-making skills. Consequently, they disregard themselves,
and their self-esteem is further lowered.
Another reason for the low level of self-esteem among
psychiatric patients as compared with normal controls is the
role of stigmatization. Several researchers have put forward
that in psychiatric patients, the stigmatization of suffering
from a severe psychiatric disorder creates typical self-
esteem­destructive ideas and low self-esteem (e.g., Berge &
Ranney, 2005; Blankertz, 2001; Kahng & Mowbray, 2005;
H. Stuart & Sartorius, 2005). Patients with psychiatric disor-
ders are not generally accepted in society as well as by their
families and are frequently criticized. They are usually
labeled as insane, mad, mental, psycho, useless, burden, and

Discussion
As we hypothesized that "there would be a significant differ-
ence in the level of self-esteem among patients with psychi-
atric disorders and normal controls," the results from a
statistical analysis of the data show that the clinical group
(patients of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, obses-
sive-compulsive disorder, and opioid dependence disorder)
scored significantly lower on the variable of self-esteem as
compared with normal controls (F = 30.513, df = 4, 255, p <
.05;Table 5). These findings are consistent with the formu-
lated hypothesis and validate the previous studies (e.g.,
Butler, Hokanson, & Flynn, 1994; Ehntholt, Salkovskis, &
Rimes, 1999; Gureje et al., 2004; Hansson et al., 1999;
Rashid, 2007; Roe, 2003; Salsali & Silverstone, 2003;
Silverstone & Salsali 2003) that have reported low levels of
self-esteem in psychiatric patients compared with normal
controls. Furthermore, post hoc Tukey's honest significant
difference (HSD) test was conducted to analyze the differ-
ence of subgroups within the clinical group from normal
controls (Table 6). All the psychiatric patients, that is,
patients of schizophrenia (MD = 3.983, p< .05), major

so on, which leads to feelings of inadequacy, a general sense
of worthlessness, and inferiority, which in turn contributes to
a low level of self-esteem. Link and Phelan (1999) illustrated
that the stigma of mental illness carries not only negative
moral connotations (e.g., "lazy") but also results in social
marginalization, isolation, withdrawal, a devalued sense of
self, and lower self-esteem for those diagnosed with a mental
disorder. Lysaker, Tsai, Yanos, and Roe (2008) suggested
that the experience of greater levels of stigma was generally
related to poorer self-esteem. This could be further explained
that the quality of feedback received by others significantly
affects one's level of self-esteem, as Leary et al. (2003) pos-
ited. They noted that approval and disapproval from environ-
ment clearly affects self-esteem. Sullivan (1953) also put
forward that self-esteem is shaped by individuals' appraisals
of how they are perceived by significant others, and specifi-
cally that negative feedback is detrimental to self-esteem.
Thus, culturally defined stigmas affect patients' self-esteem
by developing in them a sense of segregation and discrimina-
tion and inducing feelings of humility, worthlessness, and
shame, which in turn may also adversely affect the course of
their illness by causing further deterioration. The evidence
obtained in this study points to the importance of self-esteem
in planning the remedies and therapeutic interventions for
those experiencing mental illness challenges.
This study has certain limitations. First, the sample con-
sisted of young adult patients with middle socioeconomic
status who fall into only four diagnostic categories, including
schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compul-
sive disorder, and opioid dependence disorder, so that a gen-
eralization of the results to the entire psychiatric population
is not applicable. The second limitation is the use of the sub-
jective measure of Urdu self-esteem and an unstandardized
semi-structured interview form. In Pakistan, both of these
forms have never been tested for their psychometric charac-
teristics. Future research should therefore utilize a sample
from varied age groups and different diagnostic groups and
should also focus on the biological, sociological, and psy-
chological moderator or mediator mechanism underlying
self-esteem changes following the onset of psychiatric
illnesses.
