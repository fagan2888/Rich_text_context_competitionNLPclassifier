Non-technical summary
The way central banks conduct monetary policy changed with the onset of the crisis. Central
banks do no longer rely exclusively on traditional interest rate policy but also prolong the ma-
turities of repurchase agreements ("Repo"), widen the set of collateral accepted in Repo trans-
actions, and reduce the haircut applied to specific types of assets. Those measures can be sub-
sumed under the heading of unconventional monetary policy measures. To enable economists
to analyze the macroeconomic consequences of a central bank resorting to a richer set of mon-
etary policy tools that are targeted to change the liquidity situation among banks, requires to
implement an interbank market in modern macroeconomic models. In recent times a couple
of DSGE models emerged which explicitly incorporate an active banking sector (Gerali, Neri,
Sessa, and Signoretti (2010), deWalque, Pierrard, and Rouabah (2010), Dib (2009)).
In this paper we set up a New-Keynesian model that features a heterogenous financial sector that
consists of two different types of banks: a borrowing bank and a lending bank which interact
on an interbank market. Whereas the interbank borrowing bank invests its funds together with
interbank loans in a loan to a firm, the interbank lending bank invests in a riskless asset which
it can exchange against liquidity in repurchase agreements with the central bank. Moreover,
we introduce a borrowing constraint in a borrower-lender relationship as in Iacoviello (2005)
and more recently in Gerali et al. (2010) by assuming that the interbank borrowing bank's abil-
ity to obtain liquidity on the interbank market is limited by the asset portfolio she can offer
as collateral. Furthermore, to account for the recently observed enhancement of the monetary
policy toolkit we introduce an additional instrument, namely, the size of the haircut applied to
securities which the central bank accepts as collateral in repurchase agreements with interbank
lending banks. In addition, we follow Bernanke and Gertler (1999) and distinguish between the
fundamental price of capital, Q, equivalent to Tobin (1969)'s q and the market price of capi-
tal, S. The latter enters the borrowing constraint and influences the interbank lending volume.
Given an exogenous shock to the market price of capital, the model is used to analyze the effec-
tiveness of both conventional and unconventional monetary policy instruments in affecting the
business cycle.
We can show that in our model the effect of a shock to the conventional monetary policy instru-
ment on the real economy is dampened by the presence of an interbank market. Similarly, we
show that the same market amplifies an exogenous shock to asset prices. Moreover, the haircut
instrument has a positive effect on the level of interbank lending activity whose increase has the
potential to stimulate the economy. However, this comes at the risk of increased inflation in the
first periods after a negative shock to haircuts.
Given that our model contains an interbank market we argue that central banks should react
to asset price movements. Our results support a central bank which resorts to the haircut in-
strument and not to an interest rate instrument if an asset price shock happens. In terms of a
stabilization policy our results show that for a given magnitude of an asset price shock a haircut
policy is able to reduce the macroeconomic volatility substantially.
However, given that a central bank decides to implement a haircut policy it has to think about
the exit from such an unconventional monetary policy tool if inflationary pressures become too
high. In line with the monetary policy literature the model implies that a central bank should
prefer to communicate the exit date in advance and then credibly stick to it to ensure a smooth
evolution of macroeconomic aggregates resulting from the agents' expectations formation. In
case it decides not to define an exit from such a policy, the volatility of key macroeconomic
variables is low at the cost of higher inflation in the long-run as liquidity provided by the central
bank to the interbank market is growing over time.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Seit Beginn der aktuellen Finanzkrise hat sich die Geldpolitik grundlegend gewandelt, da sich
Zentralbanken nicht länger ausschließlich auf die traditionelle Zinspolitik beschränken, um ihre
geldpolitischen Ziele zu erreichen. Deshalb verlängerten sie die Laufzeiten der Offenmarktge-
schäfte ("Repos"), erweiterten den Kreis der zugelassenen Sicherheiten für diese Transaktionen
und reduzierten auch die Abschläge ("Haircuts") für ausgewählte Wertpapierklassen in Repo-
Geschäften. Diese Maßnahmen kann man unter dem Oberbegriff der unkonventionellen Geld-
politik zusammenfassen. Damit Volkswirte in der Lage sind, die makroökonomischen Folgen
zu beurteilen, die ein Zurückgreifen der Zentralbank auf dieses erweiterte Instrumentarium hat,
ist es notwendig, einen Interbankenmarkt in moderne makroökonomische Modelle zu integrie-
ren. In letzter Zeit wurden einige DSGE-Modelle entwickelt (siehe z.B. Gerali et al. (2010),
deWalque et al. (2010), Dib (2009)), in welche explizit ein solcher Interbankenmarkt integriert
worden ist.
In diesem Papier stellen wir ein Neu-Keyensianisches Modell mit einem heterogenen Finanz-
sektor auf, der aus zwei verschiedenen Arten von Banken besteht. Während die eine Bank Li-
quidität nachfragt, bietet die andere überschüssige Liquidität auf dem Interbankenmarkt an.
Erstere verwendet die Depositen von Haushalten zusammen mit Interbankkrediten dafür, Kre-
dite an Firmen zu vergeben. Die zweite Bank investiert ihre Mittel in risikolose Anlagen, deren
Angebot exogen gegeben ist und welche im Rahmen von Repo-Geschäften gegen Zentralbank-
liquidität eingetauscht werden können. Darüber hinaus enthält unser Modell eine Friktion wo-
durch die Höhe des Kreditvolumens zwischen den beiden Banken davon abhängt, über welche
Sicherheiten der Kreditnehmer verfügt (siehe Iacoviello (2005) oder Gerali et al. (2010)) und
welcher Wert für die Sicherheiten in der nächsten Periode erwartet wird. Das Instrumentarium
der Zentralbank erweitern wir, indem wir eine "Haircut-Regel" einführen, welche angewendet
wird, um den Gegenwert der Sicherheiten für die kreditgebende Bank in Offenmarktgeschäften
festzulegen. Desweiteren folgen wir Bernanke and Gertler (1999) und unterscheiden zwischen
dem Fundamentalpreis für Kapital, Q, welcher Tobin (1969)'s q entspricht, und dem Markt-
preis für Kapital S. Letzterer spielt im Rahmen der oben genannten Friktion eine Rolle und
hat Einfluss auf die Höhe des Kreditvolumens auf dem Interbankenmarkt. Wir analysieren die
Effektivität von konventioneller und unkonventioneller Geldpolitik auf den Konjunkturzyklus
bei einem exogenen Schock auf den Marktpreis für Kapital.
Wir können mit unserem Modell einerseits die Ergebnisse anderer Studien bestätigen, dass ein
heterogener Bankensektor dazu führt, dass die Wirkung eines geldpolitischen Schocks auf den
realen Sektor durch den Interbankenmarkt reduziert wird. Andererseits können wir zeigen, dass
im Falle von Vermögenspreisübertreibungen das Vorhandensein eines Finanzsektors den Effekt
auf die Realwirtschaft im Vergleich zu einer Modellierung ohne einen solchen Sektor sogar
erhöht. Hinsichtlich der Effektivität des Haircut-Instruments stellen wir fest, dass eine Sen-
kung des Abschlags auf Wertpapiere in Repo-Geschäften sowohl einen positiven Effekt auf das
Kreditvolumen auf dem Interbankenmarkt hat als auch in der Lage ist die Realwirtschaft zu
stimulieren. Allerdings geht dieses zu Lasten höherer Inflation.
Nach unserem Modell ist es möglich, die Auswirkungen einer Vermögenspreisänderung auf die
Volatilität makroökonomischer Variablen deutlich zu verringern, wenn die Notenbank in sol-
chen Fällen den Haircut verändert, statt einer dementsprechend die Zinsen anzupassen.
Sofern sich eine Zentralbank entscheidet, das Haircut-Instrument einzusetzen, sollte sie sich
auch damit auseinandersetzen, wie sie dessen Einsatz wieder beenden kann. Das gilt insbe-
sondere im Hinblick auf damit verbundene steigende Inflationsrisiken. Die Antwort unseres
Modells auf diese Frage ist, dass im Hinblick auf die Volatilität sowohl realwirtschaftlicher
als auch finanzmarktbezogener Variablen eine Strategie zu bevorzugen ist, welche explizit ein
Ausstiegsdatum für die Beendigung einer solchen Maßnahme nennt und an diesem festhält.
Dadurch wird mittels der Erwartungsbildung der Agenten eine gleichmäßige Entwicklung der
makroökonomischen Variablen unterstützt. Falls die Zentralbank die Entscheidung fällt, das
Haircut-Instrument auf unbestimmte Zeit anzuwenden, führt dieses zwar zu einer anhaltend
niedrigen Volatilität der makroökonomischen Variablen jedoch auf Kosten von höherer Infla-
tion in der Zukunft, da die Liquidität, welche dem Interbankenmarkt durch die Zentralbank
zugeteilt wird, wächst.

Abstract
In this paper we set up a New-Keynesian model with a heterogenous banking sector to
analyze liquidity problems on the interbank market. The presence of an interbank market
is essential to consider a situation where an increased liquidity supply by the central bank
is only partially passed on to the interbank market. Moreover, this framework allows us to
examine the implications of an unconventional monetary policy tool modeled as a haircut
rule applied to eligible assets in repurchase agreements ("Repos") on the interbank market.
We can show that this tool is suited to bring down the interest rate charged among banks on
the interbank market. Furthermore an exogenous bubble process is modeled to evaluate the
effects of the haircut rule for a central bank which decides to implement a "leaning-against-
the-wind"-policy. Finally, we analyze the long-run consequences of reacting to asset price
movements and examine the effects of different exit strategies. We find that the central bank
can stabilize all variables at the cost of higher inflation and that macroeconomic volatility
is smallest if the central bank communicates the exit date in advance and credibly commits
to it.

What appears to be in substance a direct transfer of mortgage and mortgage-backed securities of questionable
pedigree from an investment bank to the Federal Reserve seems to test the time honored central bank mantra in
time of crisis-"lend freely at high rates against good collateral"-to the point of no return, (Volcker (April 8, 2008),
Remarks by Paul Volcker at a Luncheon of the Economic Club of New York)
1 Introduction
In the twenty years preceding the current financial crisis all major economies have witnessed an
environment with low macroeconomic volatility known as the `Great Moderation'.1 During this
time central banks in industrialized countries set the policy rate to anchor the inflation expecta-
tions around a specified level. The twenty years of quietness before the Great Recession are by
and large attributable to good policy but according to some studies (see for example the studies
Primiceri (2005) and Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2010)) also to good luck. Once this
steady macro environment changed with the onset of the crisis, central banks were required to
change their conduct of monetary policy as well. For example, they no longer relied exclusively
on traditional interest rate policy but also prolonged the maturities of repurchase agreements
("Repo"), widened the set of collateral accepted in Repo transactions, and reduced the haircut
applied to specific types of assets. Those measures can be subsumed under the heading of un-
conventional monetary policy. So far these measures have been confined to crisis times and
were aimed at reviving the interbank market and stabilizing the financial systems as a whole.
If, however, the period of good luck is over and the economy is experiencing higher macroeco-
nomic volatility, unconventional measures might remain in place longer than initially intended.
Therefore it is important to discuss and analyse those additional instruments with their costs
and benefits.
The interbank market is important for a central bank because it is the market which is most
directly affected by monetary policy decisions and hence is the preferred channel to implement
the monetary policy strategy of a central bank. To enable economists to analyze the macroeco-
nomic consequences of a central bank resorting to a richer set of monetary policy tools that are
targeted to change the liquidity situation among banks requires to implement an interbank mar-
ket in modern macroeconomic models. In models of Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999)
or Markovic (2006) banks are financial intermediaries who channel funds from borrowers to
lenders. Although they assume profit maximizing behavior, banks in these models are assumed
to break-even each period. Only in recent times a couple of DSGE models emerged which ex-
plicitly incorporate an active banking sector (Gerali et al. (2010), deWalque et al. (2010), Dib
(2009)).
Our model features a heterogenous financial sector that consists of two different types of banks
whose behavior is the outcome of explicit optimization problems. Both types of banks accept
deposits from the household sector but their investment decisions are different. Whereas one
grants loans to firms the other invests its funds completely in safe assets which are eligible as
collateral at the central bank. In addition, the first bank with its risky exposure needs inter-
bank funding from the other bank to be secured by collateral stemming from its loan business
to the firm sector. The way the interbank market is modeled in our setup is different from the
literature. Dib (2009) for example splits up the responsibilities of a bank by assuming two

output volatility in the United States since the early 1980s.

separate entities: a savings and a lending bank. In our model each commercial bank borrows
and lends. While both borrow from the household sector, one type of commercial bank lends
to the firm sector while the other type lends to banks on the interbank market. While Gerali
et al. (2010) claim to model an interbank market, in their model in equilibrium no interaction
among wholesale banks takes place. Other studies that examine interbank liquidity flows are,
for example Eisenschmidt and Tapking (2009), Allen, Carletti, and Gale (2009) and Freixas
and Jorge (2008), however, these do not incorporate their microeconomic model into a DSGE
framework.
By assumption an interbank borrowing bank can only offer risky assets as collateral in return
for interbank liquidity. The volume of interbank lending depends on the expected value of the
collateral in the next period. If the value of the underlying collateral is expected to rise an in-
terbank lending bank accepts the risky asset as collateral for an interbank loan independent of
the collateral policy of the central bank. However, if the collateral value is expected to decline
and the central bank is unwilling to accept this risky asset as eligible asset in a main refinancing
operation, the volume of interbank lending will decline. Hence, within this model the central
bank faces a situation where the decline in interbank lending activity is not caused by concerns
about direct counterparty risk but due to concerns about the value of the collateral pledged by a
commercial bank in return for an interbank loan.
Only recently Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) incorporate uncon-
ventional monetary policy into a DSGE model to assess the effects of these policies on the
macroeconomy.2 We allow for unconventional monetary policy in our model by introducing a
haircut rule in addition to the interest rate rule to analyze the role of collateral in repurchase
agreements with the central bank. To differentiate between different qualities of collateral the
central bank is able to apply different haircuts to the securities within the set of eligible collat-
eral. Recent papers which incorporate a haircut into their models are Ashcraft, Gârleanu, and
Pedersen (2011), Gorton and Metrick (2009), Adrian and Shin (2009), Cúrdia and Woodford
(2011), and Schabert (2010). Within our framework we analyze the impact of such a haircut
policy on the lending activity on the interbank market. Because a central bank can vary the
haircut on certain asset classes in our model, it is in the position to increase or decrease the
liquidity supply to the banking sector even if the interest rate is at or near the zero lower bound.
This policy constitutes an alternative to direct liquidity provision to commercial banks and has
the advantage of not completely crowding out the lending activity on the interbank market.
Another feature that distinguishes our study from other studies mentioned above is the distinc-
tion between the fundamental price of capital which is equivalent to Tobin (1969)'s q and the
market price of capital. The latter is used to determine the value of the collateral a borrowing
bank can offer to an interbank lending bank in return for an interbank loan or to a central bank
as eligible collateral in repurchase agreements. If one value deviates from the other perma-
nently we refer to it as a bubble (or bust) process. The effect of such a bubble is an increase
in the amount of collateral available for borrowing in the interbank market. To model these
two variables we rely on the setup introduced by Bernanke and Gertler (1999) who extend the
framework of Bernanke et al. (1999). By including an exogenous bubble process we try to
contribute to the ongoing debate in the literature whether central banks should respond to asset
prices as well.
Our results confirm the results of other studies with an interbank market that a financial sector

sheet has recently been conducted by Cúrdia and Woodford (2011).

helps to dampen monetary policy shocks to the real economy. In addition, we illustrate that if
bubbles inflate the prices used to determine the value of the collateral the presence of a financial
sector amplifies shocks to the real economy. Moreover, by lowering the haircut, or equivalently
by enlarging the set of admissible collateral, the central bank has a significant and positive im-
pact on the whole economy in the short run. The only drawback is an increase in inflation after
the liquidity supply in the interbank market has increased.
In addition, we shed new light on the argument of financial stability and the question if central
banks should target asset prices. Knowing that this is primarily a political decision we follow
a purely economic line of argument and deem it appropriate to follow a "leaning-against-the-
wind"-policy. Given that a change in market prices increases the volatility of the economy in
our model we find that both the interest rate rule as well as the collateral policy can be used to
dampen a boom-bust cycle. According to our metric, however, the haircut rule is more appro-
priate for this task.
Within the same setup we are enable to analyze the long run effects of "leaning-against-the-
wind"-policy and contribute to the ongoing research on the exit strategy of a central bank en-
gaged in unconventional monetary policy. Conditional on a reduction of the haircut on eligible
collateral in Repo transactions we simulate the long run effects of such unconventional mone-
tary policy on the economy and give recommendations about the preferable strategy based on
the variances of output, inflation and financial market variables computed across different exit
scenarios. Based on this metric our model recommends to communicate the exit date in ad-
vance and stick to the announced exit date. If the central bank sticks to its asset price targeting
policy, all variables can be stabilized with the important exception of inflation which is positive
throughout. This is due to the fact that keeping the haircut low for a prolonged period of time,
the amount of liquidity provided to the interbank market is rising over time.
This paper is structured in the following way. In Section 2 the model setup is explained. The
calibration to the data is shown in Section 3. We proceed in Section 4 by stating important
results such as impulse response functions, comparative statics and the long run effects of asset
price targeting. Section 5 finally concludes.
2 Model
The model economy consists of three major blocks: the real sector, the financial sector, and the
central bank. A figure that explains the sectors and their interactions can be found in Appendix
A. The real sector comprises the household sector and the production sector and is very similar
to Bernanke et al. (1999) and Christensen and Dib (2008). Each household consumes a final
good sold by the retailer and supplies labor to entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs combine household
labor with capital bought from capital good producers to produce an intermediate good which
is sold to retailers. To transfer wealth across periods, households can save by holding deposits
at both types of banks. The interbank borrowing bank uses these deposits together with in-
terbank liquidity obtained from the interbank lending bank to grant loans to entrepreneurs. In
the relationship between the commercial bank and the entrepreneur a demand side friction is
incorporated, which results in an external finance premium that depends on the net worth an
entrepreneur has accumulated.
The financial sector consists of two different types of banks where both types of banks accept
deposits from the household sector but their investment decisions are different. Whereas one
3
grants loans to firms the other invests its funds completely in safe assets which are eligible as
collateral at the central bank. In addition, the first bank with its risky exposure needs interbank
funding from the other bank to be secured by collateral stemming from its loan business to the
firm sector. It is assumed that commercial banks are heterogenous with respect to their balance
sheet structure. One type of commercial bank has highly liquid assets on its balance sheet while
the balance sheet of the other type of commercial bank contains less liquid, risky assets. In case
the latter bank has a liquidity need it prefers to demand additional liquidity from the interbank
market. In return it offers the illiquid, risky asset as collateral to avoid having to forgo profitable
investment opportunities. In the following we will refer to the former group as interbank lend-
ing banks and to the latter group as interbank borrowing banks. The interbank lending volume
depends crucially on both the expected value of the collateral as well as the haircut applied to
the collateral in Repo transactions with the central bank.
In the following subsections the model setup and the optimization problems faced by each agent
are explained. For the model's first order conditions we refer the reader to Appendix B.1.
2.1 Household
Households are infinitely lived and maximize consumption and leisure subject to a budget con-
straint. Throughout the model h is attached to variables and parameters to denote an individual
household quantity. The instantaneous utility function has the following form
Ut
=
Ct
(h)1-c
1 - c
+
(1 - Lt
(h))1-h

The infinite sum of discounted utility is maximized by the household under the following budget
constraint which is expressed in real terms
Ct
(h) + Dt
(h) = Wt
Lt

RD

(h) (2)
The household's savings are transferred across periods by depositing it with commercial banks.
The gross return paid on household's deposits is denoted by RD
t
. Wt
is the wage in real terms
that the household gets from the entrepreneur in exchange for its labor supply Lt
(h). Finally,
Pt
(h) denotes transfer payments stemming from profits made by commercial banks, the central
bank and retailers. Tt
(h) are the lump sum taxes that the government collects from household
h. Dt
(h) refers to real deposits.
2.2 Entrepreneur
The entrepreneur is perfectly competitive and produces output that is sold to retailers. As input
factors in production they use homogenous labor (Lt
) supplied from households and capital
(Kt
) purchased from capital producers. The production function is assumed to be of the Cobb-
Douglas type
Yt

Technology which is denoted by At
follows an AR(1) process.
Each period the entrepreneur purchases capital Kt+1
to be used in production at the beginning
of the next period. The difference between the value of capital Qt

(with Qt
being the price

of capital3) and the net worth Nt
needs to be financed by a loan Bt
taken out from the interbank
borrowing bank.

(4)
The interest rate charged by banks for loans to the entrepreneur is RB
t
.
Bernanke et al. (1999) show that an external finance premium results from the financial contract
signed between a bank and the firm. Dib (2009) implemented this financial contract in a model
with a banking sector. The expected external marginal financing costs are defined as a mark up
over the lending rate. The size of the markup depends on the ratio of the market value of capital
St
over the net worth Nt
and is given by the following function
Et

(5)
The external finance premium (St
Kt+1
/Nt
) depends on the entrepreneur's leverage ratio which
is defined as St
Kt+1
/Nt
. If the leverage ratio increases, the entrepreneur increasingly relies on
debt financing which increases its probability of default.4 The aggregate net worth position of
entrepreneurs is evolving as

with  and  being the survival probability of the entrepreneur and the default probability
of the project the entrepreneur invests in, respectively. Moreover, 1 -  denotes the share
of entrepreneurial labor CEt
in the amount of total labor Ht
and µ is the parameter of the
supervising costs of the bank.
Note that the loan contract between the entrepreneur and the commercial bank is conditioned on
the market price of capital St
and not on the fundamental price Qt
. The distinction between the
market price St
and the fundamental price Qt
has been proposed by Bernanke and Gertler (1999)
in an extension of the model by Bernanke et al. (1999) 5 and allows to model exogenous asset
price bubbles.6Rt

Section 2.7.

that the marginal external financing costs equal the marginal return on capital

(7)
3Q denotes the ratio of the market value of the capital stock relative to the replacement cost of capital. In
equilibrium the adjustment costs are equal to one. In the absence of adjustment costs, the entrepreneur is able to
adjust its capital stock instantaneously, However, this behavior is not in line with empirical observations which
rather point towards a sluggish behavior of investment. That is, adjustment in the level of capital takes place over
several periods. For that reason adjustment costs at the level of the capital producer are introduced (see Section
2.3). As a result Q will not be equal to one during periods where the level of the capital stock is not equal to its
equilibrium value
4The size of the elasticity parameter  that has originally been calibrated by Bernanke et al. (1999) to be 0.05
depends on the standard deviation of the distribution of the entrepreneurs idiosyncratic shocks, agency costs, and
the entrepreneurs' default threshold. If the parameter  is set to zero, the financial accelerator vanishes and the
mark up is zero.
5The deviation of the fundamental value Qt from the market price St is denoted by ut. It holds that St
= Qt
ut

, optimal demand
for capital satisfies

where  is the depreciation rate whose parameter value is discussed in the calibration section.
Actually the latter condition is the relevant optimally condition for the capital demand by the
entrepreneur.
The fundamental return and the market return on capital are related as follows

The parameter a determines the speed of convergence back to the fundamental price Qt
and b
is given by b  a(1 - ).7 The shock to the fundamental value SQ

is normally distributed with
variance 2
S
. In the absence of shocks the market price St
moves in line with Qt
.
2.3 Capital Producer
Capital producers provide the capital purchased by entrepreneurs. They use a linear technology
to produce capital and maximize the following objective function

where  determines the depreciation rate and investment is subject to quadratic adjustment costs

detailed description can be found for example in Dib (2009).
2.4 Retailer
To introduce sticky prices we assume that retailers are Calvo (1983) price setters. This is a
common assumption in the New-Keynesian literature and implies that each period there is an
exogenous probability of 1 - p
that a retailer is able to adjust its price. The rest of the retailers
index their prices to current inflation. As in Bernanke et al. (1999) monopolistic retailers buy
the product of the entrepreneur, transform it into final output at no cost and sell it to households
or capital goods producers. The expected discounted profit function that the retailer maximizes
takes the form:

In return for the loan Bt

) to the entrepreneur, a commercial bank j obtains
collateral worth f(j)Qt
Kt
. It is assumed that a commercial bank j possesses a technology to
transform the illiquid capital stock into a marketable security. In the following we will refer
to the financial instrument generated in this process as asset-backed security. In contrast to the
value of the capital stock f(j)Qt
Kt
, the value of the asset-backed security portfolio of bank j
is given by
ABSt
(j) = f(j)St
Kt
(17)
The assumption that the risky asset ABSt
(j) depends on the market price St
and not on the
fundamental price Qt
allows us to consider the effect of asset price movements on the behavior
of banks in the interbank market where these securities serve as collateral.
Our model also features a borrowing constraint in a borrower-lender relationship in the form
proposed by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). However, in our model the financial friction arises
7
between the commercial bank j and an interbank lending bank k. The borrowing constraint of
a commercial bank vis-a-vis an interbank lending bank takes the following form8
RIB
t
IBt
 mt
Et
St+1

(18)
In order to obtain interbank liquidity IBt
(j) at the interbank interest rate RIB
t
the commercial
bank j offers its asset backed securities (ABS) as collateral. The commercial bank j's ability
to obtain interbank liquidity is limited by the expected value of the asset portfolio in the next
period. However, an interbank lending bank k encounters transaction costs which are propor-
tional to the collateral value, (1 - mt
)St+1
Kt
. These transaction costs comprise the time to find
a buyer for the collateral and legal fees paid in the process of liquidating the pledged assets.
Hence, to ensure full repayment in the case of a default of the commercial bank j, the maxi-
mum amount of interbank liquidity granted by a commercial bank k is given by mt
Et
St+1
Kt
where mt
is the loan-to-value ratio which responds to deviations of the market price of capital
from the fundamental price, ut
, to account for the reluctance of an interbank lending bank to
provide interbank loans in the presence of asset price bubbles. As mt
< 1 is assumed, the
size of the interbank loan to a bank j will always be strictly lower than the value of the asset
portfolio in the next period. In log-linearized terms mt
is set according to the following rule9:
mt

2.6 Interbank Lending Bank k
The activities performed by a commercial bank k vis-a-vis the private sector are identical to
those of a commercial bank j. However, compared to a commercial bank j, a commercial bank
k invests its funds in a liquid asset Gt
and not in a risky asset. The liquid asset Gt
can be always
exchanged against central bank liquidity if a commercial bank k is willing to supply liquidity
on the interbank market. Because the funding structure is identical across interbank lending
banks the interest rate paid on deposits will be the same across commercial banks. Moreover,
we assume that the difference between the interest rate paid on deposits and the interest ob-
tained from the investment in the liquid asset Gt
is negligible and we are able to ignore it in the
optimization problem of the commercial bank k.
The interest rate on the interbank market RIB
t
is endogenously determined by the profit maxi-
mizing behavior of interbank lending banks and interbank borrowing banks. Hence, a commer-
cial bank k which considers lending to a commercial bank j takes the policy rate Rt
set by the
central bank as given and decides optimally about the amount of liquidity supplied on the inter-
bank market. Each commercial bank k maximizes its profit function which has the following
form
IB
t
(k) = RIB
t
IBt
(k) - Rt
(MD
t
(k) - Xt
(k)) (21)
8We assume that the borrowing constraint is satisfied with equality because the size of the shock is sufficiently
small such that the economy remains in the neighborhood of the steady-state. See Iacoviello (2005)
9In section 4.3 we assume that the loan-to-value ratio is controlled by a supervisory authority and therefore the
deviation of the market price from its fundamental value has to be included
8
where Rt
denotes the policy rate which is set by the central bank (see Section 2.7), MD
t
(k) is
the demand for central bank liquidity and Xt
(k) a deposit opportunity for the interbank lending
bank k at the central bank. Defining a spread prevailing in the interbank market as
RSpread
t
= RIB
t
- Rt
(22)
we can restate the profit function (21) as follows:
IB
t
(k) = RSpread

t
(k) - Xt
(k) + Rt
IBt
(k) - RIB
t
MD
t
(k) + RIB
t

(k) (23)
Equation 23 emphasizes that the commercial bank k not only cares about the absolute interbank
rate but equivalently about the spread between the interbank interest rate and the policy rate set
by the central bank. In this way we capture the fact of the spread being a multivariate function
of (1) the tension in the interbank market (volume IBt
) (2) the liquidity supply decision of the
central bank (Mt
and ht
) and (3) the financial stability stance (mt
). We assume that commercial
bank k's demand for central bank liquidity depends on the optimally chosen value for interbank
lending and riskless asset as follows
MD
t
(k) = IBt
(k)Xt
(k)1- (24)
Unlike the Cobb-Douglas production function which takes labor and capital as input factors
and yields goods as output, here the only input factor is the supply of central bank liquidity Mt
whose division among interbank funds and deposits is governed by the parameter . If  is equal
to one, there is a one-to-one relationship between the additional liquidity supply of the central
bank and the supply of interbank liquidity on the interbank market. However,  is assumed to
be strictly smaller than one to account for the effect of the money multiplier.
In exchange for an interbank loan IBt
(k) a commercial bank k receives collateral ABSt
(k)
from a commercial bank j which is subject to a haircut ht
in liquidity operations of the central
bank. In addition, a commercial bank k possesses an exogenously given amount of liquid assets
Gt
(k) fully eligible as collateral in repurchase agreements with the central bank. Hence, the
commercial bank k faces the following collateral constraint
MD
t
(k) = Gt
(k) + (1 - ht
)ABSPD
t
(k) (25)
If ht
= 1 the central bank does not accept asset-backed securities.10 The lower the haircut,
the lower the discount applied to the risky asset by the central bank and hence the higher the
volume of liquidity obtainable per unit of asset-backed securities.
In equilibrium the supply of central bank liquidity has to equal the demand for interbank liquid-
ity given in equation (24).
2.7 Central Bank
A central bank sets the monetary policy rate Rt
in response to deviations of output and expected
inflation. Moreover, we allow for interest rate smoothing on part of the central bank.
Rt
= r
Rt-1
+ 
(Et
t+1

) + y
(Y - ¯
Y ) + R
t
(26)
10This would be the case of the Fed before the crisis. In Europe the haircut was lower than one even before the
crisis and were lowered even more during the crisis.
9
In addition, we assume that the central bank is interested in financial market stability and es-
pecially in a liquid interbank market. In this context the central bank decides which assets are
eligible as collateral in repurchase agreements and through this device it is able to vary the liq-
uidity supply to the banking sector directly. The haircut ht
set by the central bank is specified
by the following process
ht
= h
ht-1
- h
t
(27)
and is negatively related to a central bank's liquidity, that is, if the central bank decreases the
haircut ht
, the liquidity supply increases.
We do not postulate that the haircut rule should substitute the interest rate rule. The haircut rule,
however, is suited to fine-tune the liquidity situation on the interbank market once the interest
rule policy does not have the desired effect anymore because, for example, of the zero lower
bound. In addition to that it is another tool that helps to smooth the business cycle. We can show
that a decrease in the haircut can stimulate both the interbank market and the real economy.
The profit function of the central bank consists of seigniorage minus the payment on deposits a

3 Calibration
One crucial task of calibrating this model is to deal both with a real sector where one period
usually corresponds to one quarter as macroeconomic aggregates like GDP are updated on a
quarterly basis and a financial sector where information about financial variables are updated at
a much higher frequency. Hence, as a compromise we decide to calibrate the model to monthly
data11. So most of the parameters on which the literature agreed on and that are calibrated to
quarterly data are adjusted to a monthly frequency. The discount rate of households  is set to
0.997 which corresponds to a yearly interest rate of 3.6%, which is in line with other studies
which assume 4% per year. For the instantaneous household utility we assume log preferences
in both consumption and labor. The fraction of capital employed in the production process 
is set to 0.33 which is a value commonly found in the literature. With respect to the rate of
depreciation which is commonly calibrated to be 10% per year, we set the monthly depreciation
rate to a value of 0.008. The coefficient determining the mark-up p
is time-invariant and set
to 6 as for example in Bernanke et al. (1999). However, the fraction of retailers being able to
set prices each period is set slightly lower than in the quarterly specification. In a quarterly
setting it is usually assumed (as in Bernanke et al. (1999)) that (1 - p
) is equal to 0.25. In our
context we set this value to 0.15 to account for the monthly frequency. Both the elasticities of
the demand functions for entrepreneurial loans and household deposits and the adjustment cost
parameters for both interest rates are taken from Gerali et al. (2010) and are multiplied by three
as the values used in Gerali et al. (2010) are calibrated to a quarterly model. Thus, the values
are 852 and 759 for the deposit and loan demand elasticities, respectively, and 540 and 1125 for
the adjustment cost parameter d
and b
, respectively.
The financial friction parameter  which is calibrated by Bernanke et al. (1999) to be 0.05 is
recalibrated with our parameters from above and equals 0.0506. Two parameters are important
for the development of the bubble process, a and b. Those are exactly set as in Bernanke and
Gertler (1999), to 0.98 and 0.97216 (which equals a(1 - )). The amount of entrepreneurial
labor is chosen to be 0.01 as is common in the literature, see Bernanke et al. (1999). The
elasticity of Tobin's q with respect to investment is set to 0.5 as in Bernanke and Gertler (2001).
The leverage of the entrepreneurs is assumed to be 2. Finally, in line with Bernanke and Gertler
(1999) the survival rate of entrepreneurs is set to 0.95.
The values in the interest rate rule are set in accordance with Taylor (1993). With respect to the
autoregressive parameters in the AR(1) shock processes we increase all values in comparison
to existing studies as those were chosen to match quarterly time series dynamics. Thus, in our
study they take on values in the range from 0.95 in the case of government expenditure to 0.99
in the case of the haircut and the policy rate set by the central bank.
The single parameter that is completely unknown in the literature is the intensity of interbank
loans or deposits in the production function of a commercial bank k denoted by . We set
it to  = 0.9 which seems reasonable and is in line with most of the banks' balance sheets.
In addition the robustness checks indicate that the results are robust to higher values for this
parameter. The haircut is set in steady state to be 0.2, as the ECB paid a little more than 80
percent for BBB ranked assets.
A comprehensive summary of all parameter and imposed steady state values can be found in
Appendix C.
11This approach is also often used in the macro-finance literature, see for example Borgy, Mesonnier, Laubach,
and Renne (2011)

4 Results
In this section we discuss the results of the model. In the impulse response analysis of Section
4.1 we discuss how the model developed in Section 2 reacts to a set of shocks. Furthermore,
we compare the impulse responses for the same set of shocks both in a model setup with and
without an interbank market. In the case without an interbank market we assume that the com-
mercial bank k does not exist. As the commercial bank j is then in direct contact with the
central bank no interbank lending occurs in equilibrium and the interbank rate is identical to
the policy rate.12 This enables us to study the implications of incorporating an interbank market
on the model dynamics. In Section 4.2 we answer the question whether in our model frame-
work central banks should "lean against the wind", that is, if a central bank should react to asset
prices or not. Boom-bust cycles caused by market price fluctuations are simulated following the
procedure laid out in Bernanke and Gertler (1999). Finally, in Section 4.3 three different exit
strategies for the central bank are analyzed within the model framework proposed in Section 2.
4.1 Impulse Response Analysis
In this section we examine the model dynamics in response to four types of shocks: a monetary
policy shock, a shock to the haircut ht
applied to risky assets, a shock to technology At
and to
the market price of capital St
. The impulse responses are expressed in percentage deviations
from steady state and one period corresponds to one month. All corresponding figures can be
found in Appendix D.1.
Figure 2 shows the impulse response functions to an unanticipated 25 bp increase (3 pp in an-
nualized terms) in the nominal interest rate. As the policy rate rises, liquidity demanded by
the commercial bank k declines and the interest rate for interbank loans increases. This in turn
lets the commercial banks demand less interbank funds. At the same time a higher interest rate
induces the commercial bank k to hold more deposits at the central bank. This countercyclical
movement of interbank loans and deposits is due to the specification of the production function
of the commercial bank k.13 As a result the fundamental price of capital Qt
decreases on im-
pact before returning gradually to its steady state. Because the loan rate RB
t
increases as well,
demand for capital by the entrepreneur decreases. Thus the capital stock declines and output
declines. Hence, our model recommends to raise interest rates in response to a boom in asset
prices.
An interbank market smoothes the responses of the economy to a monetary policy shock com-
pared to the case without an interbank market. Taking for example output and inflation, the
impulse responses are all qualitatively the same but the initial impact is much more pronounced.
Liquidity decreases more than in the case where an interbank market is not present. Moreover,
the decline in the fundamental price of capital and thus the decline in the value of asset-backed
securities is stronger if the interbank market is shut down.
If the central bank lowers the haircut on asset-backed securities temporarily, the liquidity supply
increases on impact and converges slowly back to its steady-state (see Figure 3). This is due to
the fact that the autoregressive parameter of the haircut is chosen to be very close to one and
12Even in the model without an interbank market the results will differ from Bernanke and Gertler (1999) due
to the presence of an profit maximizing commercial bank
13The percentage increase in deposits is much higher because its steady state value is very low.
12
one time period corresponds to one month.14 As expected both output and inflation increase on
impact in response to a 10% decrease in the haircut applied by the central bank. The lowering
of the haircut has a positive effect on the fundamental price of capital which then increases the
value of the asset-backed securities. As the total value of collateral offered by the commercial
banks in return for interbank loans increases, the interbank lending rate decreases which stim-
ulates interbank lending. Besides rising interbank lending also deposits go up. This is the only
time that both quantities move in the same direction.15 This stimulus, however, comes at a cost
of higher inflation.16
In Figure 4 technology increases by 1%. As this shock originates in the real sector the responses
of the real variables (output, inflation, fundamental price of capital) are in line with other stud-
ies that incorporate a financial accelerator (see Bernanke et al. (1999) and Christensen and Dib
(2008)). As the technology shock leads to a decrease in the policy rate, the interbank lend-
ing rate decreases as well which in turn stimulates interbank lending activity. In the case of
a technology shock the two setups deliver similar responses for output and consumption. If
the interbank market is missing the price of capital and therefore the asset-backed securities
are deviating a bit more from their respective steady states. The same holds true for liquidity.
If anything, then a shock to technology is dampened by the presence of the interbank market,
although not by as much as in the case of a monetary policy shock.
Finally, we analyze a shock which leads to a 10% increase in the market price St
.17 In this case,
for the first time, the impulse responses of market price and fundamental price are not identical
(see Figure 5). While both prices increase, the market value rises by ten percent more, driving
up the value of the asset-backed securities above their fundamental value as their value depends
on the market price St
. Although the liquidity supply by the central bank rises with the value
of the asset backed securities, banks are reluctant to increase their interbank lending and rather
invest in riskless deposits. Hence, in our model banks become more cautious in their investment
behavior in response to sharp increases in asset prices. Although the increase in the value of
the asset-backed securities results from a shock to the market price and not from an increase in
the liquidity supplied by the central bank, the model resembles the behavior of the banks in the
aftermath of the financial crisis. Namely, that in response to an increase in liquidity banks are
reluctant to lend in the interbank market and rather invest in riskfree assets.
A shock to the market price St
exhibits a significantly different evolution of variables. With-
out an interbank market the size of the market price increase is only about a third compared to
its impact in the setup that features an interbank market. Asset-backed securities and liquidity
show similar responses across model specifications. After all volatility is nevertheless greatly
reduced once the interbank market is eliminated. In this case the interbank market amplifies
shocks to the market price of capital St
.
14In a period of forty months liquidity as well as the other persistent financial variables converge back to their
steady states
15Compare on the real side the increase of both labor and capital after a technology shock using the same
production function specification.
16A comparison between the model with and without an interbank market is not very meaningful here as the
haircut policy in our setup only works with an interbank market. The assumption hinges on the fact that the com-
mercial bank k gets liquidity from the central bank in exchange for government bonds and asset-backed securities.
Once the interbank market is eliminated, the Central Bank has full control over the liquidity supply to the banking
sector.

4.2 Boom-Bust Cycles
In this subsection we apply the methodology of Bernanke and Gertler (1999) and Bernanke
and Gertler (2001) to a model framework with a microfounded interbank market and where the
central bank has an additional central bank instrument, namely, the haircut rule given in equation
(36). The question we try to answer is whether central banks should `lean against the wind',
that is, if a central bank should respond to deviations of asset prices from their fundamental
value. To account for this possibility we incorporate both in the Taylor rule as well as in the
haircut rule deviations of the market value from its steady state if we consider reactions to the
asset price.

The parameter c determines the sensitivity of the central bank to asset price deviations from
its fundamental value ¯
S which is equal to ¯
Q in equilibrium. As a "leaning-against-the-wind"-
policy is considered c > 0 is assumed. Thus the central bank will decrease the haircut if the
market price of capital St
is below its steady-state. We plot six variables18: Output and inflation
to analyze the impact on macroeconomic volatility, interbank loans and the external finance
premium to consider financial markets and the fundamental market price as well as the market
price of capital.
In this subsection we compare five different cases which are specified in Table 2. These cases
differ in the central bank's reaction to asset price deviations when deciding about the setting of
their policy instruments. In case 1 the central bank only reacts to inflation and output with the
Taylor rule. The haircut rule is autoregressive. Asset prices are not targeted at all. Compared to
this, case 2 includes asset prices in the Taylor rule with the same coefficient used in Bernanke
and Gertler (1999). The haircut rule is not responding to the market price of capital. Cases 3
to 5 reflect no asset price targeting in the interest rate rule but responding to deviations of the
market price of capital with the haircut rule where c is increasing from 0.1 to 0.5.

simple AR(1) process that does not react to asset prices. To assess the quantitative importance
of the stability gains we calculate the variances for each of the six variables shown in Figure 6.

Case 2:TR-LATW 0.0048 0.0021 0.0226 0.0632 0.1957 0.00016
Table 3: Stabilization Gains I
The results for cases 1 and 2 indicate that it does not make a difference if the monetary authority
is targeting asset prices or not. If anything, however, the evolution of inflation for example is a
bit more dampened if the interest rate rule reacts to asset prices. This is different from Bernanke
and Gertler (1999) and is likely to stem from the fact that the interbank market amplifies market
price shocks. Hence, if they are mitigated by a rule, boom-bust cycles are less pronounced.
However, even more important is the answer to the question, which instrument is more appro-
priate to target asset prices. Therefore we plot in Figure 7 once again the Taylor rule which
incorporates asset prices and also the haircut rule with different reaction coefficients on market
prices of capital. To assess the quantitative importance of the stability gains we calculate the
variances for each of the six variables shown in Figure 7.
Output Inflation Fundamental Price Q Market Price S Interbank Loans Ext.Fin.Premium

Table 4: Stabilization Gains II
Based on the results in Table 4 which depicts the variances of the variables plotted in Figure
7 we can confirm the result of Cecchetti, Genberg, and Wadhwani (2002) who argue in favor
of including asset prices in the set of instruments by the monetary authority. But the overall
performance can be dramatically improved if the haircut rule is allowed to respond to asset
prices. The stronger the coefficient, the larger the macro-stabilization gains. As a result, our
model predicts that macroeconomic stability is higher if a central bank uses a haircut policy and
not the interest rate policy to increase its liquidity supply.
4.3 Exit Strategies
In the aftermath of a crisis exit strategies and primarily the timing of the exit are very important
questions for central banks. We are not able to determine the optimal exit date within our model.
Nevertheless we are able to analyze the response of the economy to an exit. Methodologically
we follow Winkler and Angeloni (2011) who examine exit strategies at the government level in
a deterministic environment. However, we perform this exercise in connection with exit strate-
gies of the monetary authority. In our scenario we examine three cases: (1) the exit from a
haircut policy by which risky assets are purchased at lower haircuts than normal and (2) the
simultaneous exit from both the above mentioned haircut policy and an interest rate policy that
keeps the interest rate close to its zero lower bound and (3) an exit from a policy that keeps the
15
loan-to-value ratio at a level above normal.19
In Figure 8 we depict four variables and their reactions if the market price is shocked negatively.
One path shows how the economy evolves if the central bank can credibly commit not to exit
from its haircut policy ("no exit"). Given a negative shock to the market price, the haircut de-
creases which keeps output and the prices of capital close to their steady state values. However,
inflation rises before stabilizing at a higher level. Another path exemplifies how the variables
evolve if agents are surprised by the fact that the central bank ignores deviations of the market
price of capital from period twenty-five onwards ("unanticipated exit") and the haircut returns
back to its steady-state value at a pace governed by the AR-coefficient h
. It is obvious that
until the time of the unanticipated exit the economy's response is identical to the "no exit"-case.
Afterwards, given that the haircut is no longer responding to the asset price, output and inflation
drop immediately and considerably, as liquidity is reduced sharply. In addition, the prices of
capital reduce unexpectedly before returning gradually to the steady state value. The last path
depicted in Figure 8 belongs to a situation where the agents anticipate correctly from the very
beginning that after twenty-four periods the central bank is no longer stimulating the economy
with its haircut instrument (`anticipated exit'). Hence, for all variables this path has to differ
from period one onwards as the expectation of the central bank abandoning the liquidity provi-
sion drives up output after a few periods and lets inflation fall from the very beginning. Once
the haircut rule is actually shut down, the prices of capital and output experience a sudden but
only slight dip before returning quickly to their steady states. Only inflation takes longer to
adjust. Table 5 shows the variances of the four variables plotted in Figure 8. The variances are
lowest for the case of a constant haircut. Moreover, the variances are significantly lower if the
central bank exits its constant haircut policy as anticipated by the agents in the model.
Output Inflation Fundamental Price Q Market Price S
No Exit 0.0039 0.0014 0.0191 0.0335
Anticipated Exit 0.0484 0.0052 0.0552 0.0779
Unanticipated Exit 0.2622 0.0032 1.1972 1.3867
Table 5: Exit from Haircut Policy
Figure 9 shows the results of a central bank which exits its haircut policy after twenty-four
periods and simultaneously increases the interest rate to a level implied by the Taylor-rule. The
results are more mixed in this example. For output and inflation the anticipated response is
much closer to the unanticipated one. Unlike in the previous case where only an exit from the
low haircut regime rule was examined the response to inflation looks much smoother with an
initial huge spike in the beginning when the interest rate is allowed to increase above the zero
lower bound. But the response of both prices of capital is less pronounced in the case of an
anticipated exit.
19One could assume that the loan-to-value is controlled by a supervisory authority whose only objective is to
keep excesses on the interbank market at bay. Note that both the haircut rule and the loan-to-value ratio respond to
asset price deviations.

Output Inflation Fundamental Price Q Market Price S
No Exit 8.2629 10.2129 2.8563 3.4686
Anticipated Exit 9.3231 8.5345 4.9132 5.7406
Unanticipated Exit 8.0824 10.7364 10.8665 11.9479
Table 6: Exit from Haircut Policy plus Taylor-Rule
The conclusion drawn from the variances in Table 6 is that less volatility in inflation comes
at the cost of more volatility in the other variables. While overall the level of the variances is
higher, again the anticipated exit is preferable to an unanticipated exit.
Finally, in Figure 10 we assume that the central bank is able to control the loan-to-value ratio and
acts as a supervisory authority. The setup is the same as in the previous cases with the instrument
being shut down after twenty-four periods and letting it return to its steady-state value at a speed
governed by a pure AR(1) process afterwards. In the `no exit'-case the loan-to-value ratio would
be constantly above its steady-state value which leads to very little macroeconomic volatility
as can be seen in Figure 10. After a shock to the market price output decreases and inflation
increases slightly. In the case of an anticipated exit, the reaction of output and and inflation is
stronger. After the exit, output as well as the prices for capital increase sharply whereas inflation
drops considerably because we assumed that the loan-to-value ratio runs countercyclical to the
development in the asset-backed securities. Once the loan-to-value ratio returns to its normal
level, the value of asset-backed securities increases and overall demand in the real sector drives
up the price of capital and output. If the exit is unanticipated by the agents, output and the price
of capital increase even stronger. This is confirmed by the variances produced by the simulation
and which are depicted in Table 7.

5 Conclusion
The financial crisis has changed the way economists have to think about modeling and de-
scribing monetary policy. This paper tries to take a step in the right direction by modeling an
interbank sector with optimizing banks in the presence of an interbank market. By this model-
ing device unconventional monetary policy can be analyzed which includes not only a simple
interest rate rule but also a collateral policy. This unconventional monetary policy has important
implications for the characteristics of business cycles. Furthermore, we are able to take up the
debate on leaning against the wind and argue whether it is advisable to include asset prices in
the monetary policy setup and enhance the debate by analyzing a second monetary instrument,
namely the haircut.
We find that the interbank market matters for the economy as a whole as it decreases macroe-
conomic volatility if an interest rate shock hits the economy and amplifies it if an asset price
17
bubble occurs. Once this market is drying up or risks to be malfunctioning, central banks are
able to react and stimulate the liquidity situation on this market by resorting to an additional
instrument besides traditional interest rate policy. The haircut as an additional instrument can
be assumed to be even more important if the policy rate set by the central bank is already close
to the zero lower bound and restricts the leeway of a central bank. Decreasing haircuts is the
instrument we analyzed and it works fine to boost interbank lending and increase output in total.
This comes at the risk of increased inflation in the first periods after a negative shock to haircuts.
With respect to the ongoing debate in the literature we back the position of Bernanke and Gertler
(1999) and claim that asset prices should not be incorporated in the interest rate rule. However,
in this model framework both financial and macroeconomic volatility are lowest if asset price
deviations are taken into consideration in the haircut rule. After a negative shock to the market
prices of financial assets, central banks can reduce the macroeconomic volatility further if they
commit to exit at a pre-announced date. Agents' expectations formation contributes then to a
smoothing of key variables. If they do not exit at all from this policy, all other macro variables
are nevertheless well stabilized at the cost of higher inflation.
An interesting way to extend the model would be first to implement default probabilities on
the interbank market which certainly would increase the responses in a financial crisis setup.
Secondly, having already some type of shocks included both in the real as well as in the fi-
nancial sector, one further possibility would be to estimate the model to match certain country
characteristics more accurately.
