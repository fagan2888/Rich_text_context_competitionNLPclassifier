Abstract
The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the implementation of a universal school-based cognitive behavioral program whose
target is to prevent depressive symptoms in adolescents. The study had a quasi-experimental design with pretest, posttest, and
a 1-year follow-up and provides an illustrative calculation for the implementation costs of the intervention. Sixty-two students
(aged 14) and seven tutors participated. A majority of the students and all of the tutors were satisfied with the intervention.
The students, both females and males, rated their depressed symptoms as significantly lower after the course; and for the
females, this was maintained 1-year postintervention. The implementation costs for the initial 2 years were about US$300 per
student. Positive effects of a universal school-based cognitive behavioral intervention aiming at preventing depressive
symptoms in adolescents were found, especially among females.

Introduction
School has been proposed as a good place for health-
promoting interventions (DeSocio & Hootman, 2004). Cogni-
tive behavioral programs are found to have positive effects in
preventing depressive symptoms in adolescents (Corrieri
et al., 2013). There is, however, a great need to evaluate effec-
tive interventions in ``real-world'' practice in order to investi-
gate their sustainability and feasibility (O'Connell, Boat, &
Warner, 2009). The purpose of this article is to describe the
first 2 years of the implementation of a school-based preven-
tion program, its effects on depressive symptoms, the costs
involved, and the views of the students and tutors.
Background
Promoting well-being and preventing depressive symptoms
in adolescence are important school health concerns.
Depression in adolescence is a common health issue globally
(Patel, Flisher, Hetrick, & McGorry, 2007), with a 1-year
prevalence of more than 4% by the end of adolescence (Tha-
par, Collishaw, Pine, & Thapar, 2012). Preventing depres-
sive symptoms means not only less individual suffering
but also fewer societal costs (Kessler, 2012). We are most
likely to find adolescents at school, and therefore school
may be a good place to implement intervention programs
targeting depression (Carnevale, 2013). However, it is
essential that the programs be effective not only in study set-
tings but also when implemented in schools and conducted
by the regular school staff. The RE-AIM framework is a
model used for assessing the public health impact of an
intervention (Glasgow, Vogt, & Boles, 1999). It was devel-
oped to overlap the gap between interventions found to be
effective in study settings but that are difficult to implement
effectively in the world of busy, often understaffed commu-
nity settings. The emphasis on developing clinically signif-
icant outcomes has produced a lot of intensive, expensive
interventions that are demanding for both students and staff.
Low-intensity interventions that are less efficacious but

reach a large population may have a more pervasive impact
(Glasgow et al., 1999). Unfortunately, there is a serious lack
of real-world evaluation of the school-based programs con-
cerning behavioral and emotional issues (see Fact Box 1;
O'Connell et al., 2009; The Swedish Council on Health
Technology Assessment, 2010).
Prevention programs are categorized as universal (desig-
nated for everyone in a population), selective (designated for
risk groups), or indicated (designated for those who already
have symptoms; Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994). Universal
approaches may have advantages over indicated and selec-
tive interventions due to higher recruitment rates and less
risk of stigmatizing (Corrieri et al., 2013). A cognitive beha-
vioral intervention developed in the United States and used
for selective and indicated prevention of depression--``Cop-
ing with Stress'' (Clarke & Lewinsohn, 1995)--has been
adopted to a Swedish setting and used here as a universal
school-based intervention, called ``Depression in Swedish
Adolescents'' or DISA (Treutiger & Lindberg, 2013). The
theoretical orientation of the intervention is represented by
the multifactorial model of depression (Lewinsohn, Hober-
man, Teri, & Hautzinger, 1985) in which increased depres-
sion is presumed to be the result of multiple etiological
elements, such as negative cognitions, stressful events, pre-
disposing vulnerabilities, risk factors (e.g., being female,
having a previous history of depression, having depressed
parents), and immunities to depression (e.g., high self-
esteem, coping skills, high frequency of pleasant events and
activities). The DISA course comprises 10 structured group
sessions of 11
=2 hr each, led by school nurses, school social
workers, and teachers. Although the Coping with Stress
course has been well evaluated in the United States (Clarke
et al., 1995, 2001; Garber et al., 2009), only one evaluation
has been carried out regarding DISA, showing slightly pos-
itive results (Treutiger & Lindberg, 2013). There is a need to
investigate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementa-
tion, and maintenance (Glasgow et al., 1999) of the program.
Aim
The aim was to evaluate a universal school-based cognitive
behavioral intervention whose target is to prevent depressive
symptoms in adolescents. Specific research questions were
as follows:
Research Question 1: Is there a reduction of depressive
symptoms after delivering the intervention, and can this
be maintained at the one-year follow-up?
Research Question 2: Is there a difference in improved
depressive symptoms between boys and girls
postintervention?
Research Question 3: What are the students' and tutors'
experiences of the intervention?
Research Question 4: How much is the total implemen-
tation cost of the intervention?
Method
The study had a quasi-experimental design with pretest,
posttest, and a 1-year follow-up (Shadish, Cook, & Camp-
bell, 2002) and provides an illustrative calculation of the
implementation costs of the intervention. This study was
approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund
(2012/462). Parents, adolescents, and tutors were provided
with written and oral information about the study and its vol-
untary nature. The school principal, parents, and participants
gave their written informed consent.
Participants
A power calculation was made a priori with mean change
in Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) as the primary outcome. A mean difference of
2.0 was regarded as clinically relevant and for 80%
power. The power calculation showed that a total sample
of 49 participants were needed (standard deviation [SD]:
5.0; a ¼ .05).
The study was performed in southern Sweden, in a muni-
cipality with 2,700 inhabitants and with only one school with
365 students. During the academic years 2010­2011 and
2011­2012, all students in Grade 8 (14 years old) were
offered a voluntary psychoeducational course in the regular
school context. Of the 68 students, 62 accepted the offer and
participated. Six students (two females and four males) who
did not participate in the intervention instead took part in the
ordinary school schedule, which was physical education in
all cases. The tutors were school social workers (n ¼ 3),
teachers (n ¼ 3), and a school nurse (n ¼ 1), all of whom had
undergone 3 days of training and 1 day of supervision in the
method. Every course had two tutors, and the groups
Fact Box 1. Depression in Adolescence.
Depressive disorder in adolescence is a common mental health
problem in adolescents globally but is often unrecognized. The
estimated 1-year prevalence is 4­5% in mid- to late adolescence.
Depression is a major risk factor for suicide in adolescence, with
a majority of adolescent suicide victims reported to have a
depressive disorder at the time of death. Depression is also
linked with serious social and academic impairments. The
features of the disorder are broadly similar in adolescents and
adults, with the exception that in adolescents, irritable rather
than depressed mood is a core symptom. But depression in
adolescents is missed more often than in adults perhaps because
of the prominence of irritability, mood reactivity, and fluctuating
symptoms in adolescents. It is not unusual for depression to be
missed because the primary presenting problems are unexplained
physical symptoms, eating disorders, anxiety, refusal to attend
school, decline in academic performance, substance misuse, or
behavioral problems.

consisted of 10­18 students. There were five groups in total:
three with girls only and two with boys only.
Measurement
The students answered the questionnaires in the classroom,
wrote their comments with paper and pencil, and were
instructed not to look at each other's answers. The tutors were
available to offer support if there were problems understand-
ing the questionnaires. The students were asked to complete
the CES-D (Radloff, 1977) in the first and the last sessions
and again after 12 months. The CES-D is a self-reported mea-
sure of the frequency of 20 depressive symptoms. Each item
is scored for frequency over the past week, from 0 (rarely or
never) to 3 (most or all of the time), with a total possible score
range between 0 and 60. The CES-D has been found to be
valid and reliable in adolescents (Roberts, Lewinsohn, & See-
ley, 1991). Scores equal to or above 16 are considered to indi-
cate a high risk for depressive symptoms (Treutiger &
Lindberg, 2013; Young, Mufson, & Davies, 2006).
At the end of the course, the students were encouraged to
write comments about the course. The instructions were ``To
find out what you think about these sessions a little bit more
carefully, we would like you to fill out this form. You can fill
it out anonymously if you wish.'' At the 12-month follow-
up, questions about place of birth, family, and economic
situation and the question ``What did you think about the
intervention?'' were added. The tutors were also asked to
write comments about the intervention at the end of the
course, and the tutor instructor provided information about
the costs of the intervention.
Procedure
The intervention was offered as a voluntary course in lieu of
the regular physical education class. It was given once a
week, 11
=2 hr each time, for a period of 10 weeks, on the
same weekday and at the same time for every session. All
courses were given in the morning and took place in the
school conference room where fruit was served. The pro-
gram is manual based, with a fixed curriculum for every
session (see Fact Box 2). It focuses on training in
cognitive-restructuring skills, techniques for modifying irra-
tional and negative self-statements, and ideas to reduce the
risk of developing depressive symptoms.
Data Analysis
Frequency analyses were performed to describe the following
demographic and background characteristics of the students:
gender, age, place of birth, parents living together, and per-
ceived economic situation (The question was ``How well off
financially do you think your family is?'' with six possible
answers: Very well, rather well, average, not that well, not
well at all, or don't know). The Friedman test (chi-square)
was used for measuring differences in the CES-D scores
between preintervention, postintervention, and the 12-month
follow-up. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for post hoc
analysis. A reduced p value (Bonferroni method) of .0167 was
used to control for the risk of mass significance due to
Fact Box 2. A Group Cognitive Intervention Aimed at
Preventing Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents.
The American program ``Coping with Stress'' (Clarke &
Lewinsohn, 1995) was modified by the Center for Public Health
in Stockholm for a Swedish setting and was called ``Depression
in Swedish Adolescents,'' or DISA. The Coping with Stress
course is an indicated program specifically designed for those
showing signs of depression, whereas DISA is a universal
program that does not require participants to have or have had
depressive symptoms.
Setting: The program is now frequently used in schools all
over Sweden and is mainly provided for girls aged 13­15.
Studies have shown that girls in this age group have many
psychosocial complaints (Swedish National Institute of Public
Health, 2011). School health staff and teachers are trained to be
tutors. The course consists of 10 weekly, manual-based ses-
sions, each 60­90 min long, with about 8­15 students.
The program is based on:
 cognitive behavioral techniques to change negative
thoughts;
 communication training and training in problem-solving
strategies;
 exercises to strengthen social skills and social networks and
increase participation in health promotion activities.
The program is manual based and every session is
designed to a certain topic:
Content of the sessions in the DISA program
Session 1: Introduction: activities for getting to know each
other, rules for the program, positive and negative spirals
Session 2: Coping with stress and cognitive restructuring, stress
and depressive symptoms, the link between thoughts, feelings,
and actions, identification of positive and negative thoughts
Session 3: Identification of activating events and situations,
stressful situations, and negative thoughts
Session 4: The power of positive thinking, how to increase the
number of positive thoughts and activities
Session 5: Changing negative thoughts to positive thoughts,
identification of irrational thoughts
Session 6: Discovering irrational ways of thinking (erroneous
thought patterns), identifying negative ways of thinking (thought
traps)
Session 7: The origin of negative thoughts, ways to cope with
stressful events/situations
Session 8: Techniques for stopping negative thoughts,
communication practice Part 1
Session 9: Communication practice Part 2 and social skills,
identification of negative thoughts, and how to replace them
with positive thoughts
Session 10: Prevention of depressive symptoms, how to
maintain skills, coping with difficulties, planning for crisis,
maintain well-being, and how to cope with early warning signals.

multiple comparisons (Field, 2009). The statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS, version 17.0.
The written comments from the students and the tutors
were analyzed using qualitative content analysis (Krippen-
dorff, 2012). The software program Open Code 4.1 was
used. The texts were read several times and then condensed,
coded, and grouped into categories. During this process, the
authors discussed the analysis to obtain consensus and
enhance trustworthiness (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004).
Two categories emerged from the students' comments, and
two categories from the tutors' comments.
Results
Sixty-two students participated in the intervention in Grade
8 (their age thus being 14 years). All but three students were
born in Sweden, and 10% of the parents were born abroad.
This may be compared with the rest of Sweden in which
15% of residents are born abroad (Statistics Sweden,
2012). About 86% of the students had parents living together
and 77% of the students believed that their families were in a
good or very good economic situation. The school is located
in an area with high mean income, according to Statistics
Sweden (2012).
CES-D: Questionnaire About Depressive Symptoms
The students answered the CES-D questionnaire at the start
and the end of the program and also after 1 year. At the
1-year follow-up, 55 (89%) students had answered the
questionnaire on all three occasions. The CES-D scores
of the females significantly changed (improved) from
preintervention to postintervention and at the 12-month
follow-up (p ¼ .018). When Wilcoxon tests were used to
follow-up on this finding, it appeared that the CES-D score
did significantly change from the preintervention to the
postintervention (p ¼ .031) and from preintervention to
12-month follow-up (p ¼ .041).
This long-term effect did not appear in the male popula-
tion. Although the CES-D scores for the males did signifi-
cantly change from preintervention to postintervention and
at the 12-month follow-up (p ¼ .008); when Wilcoxon tests
were used to follow-up on this finding, it appeared that the
CES-D score did significantly change from the preinterven-
tion to the postintervention (p ¼ .027) but that this was not
maintained from preintervention to the 12-month follow-up
(p ¼ .726; Table 1).
Student Experience
The students were asked to rate their experience (positive,
neutral, or negative) with the course. In all, 64% of the stu-
dents were positive, 9% were negative, and 27% were neu-
tral. More females than males were positive but the
difference was not significant. The students were also asked
to answer an open question, ``What did you think of the
intervention?'' Two categories emerged from the student
comments: ``achieving a new way of thinking'' and ``getting
to know each other better.'' The category ``achieving a new
way of thinking'' was concerned with the learning outcomes
of the program mainly about identifying one's thoughts and
changing negative thoughts to positive ones.
I have got a new way of thinking; I have learned how to change
negative thoughts into positive ones. (Female)

It feels good to start the morning with a relaxed, stress-free les-
son. It felt good to identify my thoughts, both the negative ones
and the positive ones, in order to control them more easily.
(Female)
The girls wrote more comments than the boys in response to
the open question about what they thought about the DISA
course. Most of them had positive comments, but some girls
wrote that they did not think that the course gave them any-
thing and some found it boring. The boys used fewer words
in their comments but most of them were positive:
It was great to get tips about how to change negative thoughts
fast! (Male)
Some boys wrote that the program was unnecessary and bor-
ing and did not help them.
``Getting to know each other better'' seems to be an
important outcome of the course. Although one girl wrote
that she did not want to talk about her feelings with the other
participants, many students wrote about the communication
training as being fun and useful.
The most important thing for me is that we girls in Grade 8
became closer to each other and we got to know one another
more deeply. (Female)
It was fun and I learned a lot, and it was good to get to know the
others in the group. (Male)
Being a Tutor
Among the tutor comments, two categories emerged, ``con-
cerns about practical conditions'' and ``adapting the program
to the group.'' All tutors were positive about the program
although they also described challenges and difficulties.
Comments in the category ``concerns about practical condi-
tions'' were that the course took a lot of time, but they were
given this time by the school administration, which is a
requirement for future courses. They found that DISA was
needed for both girls and boys, and they found the group size
to be important. One of the boys' groups had 18 participants
and they found this too big. Students who scored high (>16)
on the CES-D questionnaire were offered individual follow-
up with the school nurse. The course was offered as a volun-
tary class at school, though almost all the students in Grade 8
chose to take the course. They reflected on the importance of
good chemistry between the tutors (there were two tutors in
each course) and felt that it was good for new tutors to col-
laborate with someone with more experience. They also
found that they were able to conduct the courses more
smoothly as they became more experienced. Comments in
the category ``adapting the program to the group'' were con-
cerned with how they had included more games and more
communication exercises, as well as a set of cards with pic-
tures of bears expressing different feelings, in order to make
the program more appropriate for the audience. They found
that some students did not work seriously during the pro-
gram; these students did not actively participate during the
discussions and did not do their homework. The tutors found
that the program used words and metaphors about connec-
tions between thoughts, emotions, and actions that were dif-
ficult for some students to grasp; therefore, they tried to
adapt the course to the group.
Illustrative Calculation of the Implementation Costs
Introducing a new program entails allocating resources to
train program tutors and to implement the program
(Drummond, Sculpher, Torrance, O'Brien, & Stoddart,
2005). We have made an illustrative calculation of costs of
the program implementation using the figures from the pilot
study regarding time used for training program tutors, pre-
paration, and conducting the 10-week course with five
groups of students (see Appendix). In total, the cost was
US$300 per student to implement the program (Table 2).
Of this, as much as half the costs are related to training
tutors, including time and fees. If these tutors repeat the pro-
gram, the average cost per student will fall. In addition, in
this particular setting the program was conducted within the
current budget, and no extra staff were employed. Costs
other than wages corresponded to about US$50 per student.
Discussion
The RE-AIM provides a framework for identifying pro-
grams that work in real-world environments (Glasgow
et al., 1999). The results will be discussed through the lens
of the following factors: reach, effectiveness, adoption,
implementation, and maintenance.
Reach
The factor of reach refers to the proportion of the target
population that participated in the intervention. All the stu-
dents in Grade 8 (aged 14) were given the opportunity to
participate in the intervention as a voluntary course during
the regular physical education curriculum time. Only 6 of

the 68 students declined to participate, 2 females and 4
males. Three of them stated that they would rather partici-
pate in the ordinary physical education class, and three stu-
dents did not provide a reason. The school is located in a
relatively high-income area, and, therefore, further studies
are called for to investigate the reach in areas with a differ-
ent socioeconomic situation.
Efficacy/Effectiveness
The students scored lower on measures of recent depressive
symptoms at the 1-year follow-up, compared with preinter-
vention. However, upon taking a closer look at the material,
we found that this improvement was only significant for
females. At postintervention, there were significantly less
depressive symptoms among the males compared with base-
line, but this was not maintained at the 1-year follow-up.
However, for the females, the significant improvement was
maintained from postintervention to the 1-year follow-up. At
baseline, the CES-D scores were better compared with other
studies in Sweden (Treutiger & Lindberg, 2013) and in the
United States (Clarke et al., 1995). One may ask whether
these results have any clinical relevance if the participants
already felt good at the start. But the fact that the girls scored
significantly better at postintervention and at the 1-year
follow-up must be considered a positive effect for them. The
only previously published study (Treutiger & Lindberg,
2013) of the DISA program in Sweden did not find signifi-
cant changes in CES-D scores at the 1-year follow-up.
Overall,students ratedthe program highly. Only a few (9%)
had a negative attitude to the course, whereas 64% were posi-
tive and 27% neutral. The majority of the students who left
more detailed written comments on the course were positive
about it. They foundthat the course had taught thema new way
ofthinking,andfromthecomments,itispossibletounderstand
that they had learned the basics of cognitive behavioral ther-
apy. They also wrote that the course made the group climate
better. But one girl, in contrast, wrote that she did not want
to talk about her feelings in front of the others in the group.
Although the course was a voluntary one, the students had not
chosen their group members. Making the group atmosphere
comfortable is the responsibility of the tutor. The DISA course
is based on the participants discussing their feelings quite
openly and for this, a safe atmosphere in the group is needed.
Adoption
The factor adoption refers to the school's acceptance of the
interventionwithintheorganization.Thisisa real-worldstudy,
meaning that the intervention was initiated by the school. The
researchers were invited to evaluate the implementation, but
the intervention would have been conducted even if this eva-
luation study had not been performed. The intervention was
well accepted by the school, and the tutors found that they
receivedsufficient support fromthe schooladministration,that
is, enough time to plan and conduct the course. They pointed
out that this support was necessary for future courses.
Implementation
All of the tutors were positive toward the course, but they
also highlighted some difficulties. For example, there were
some students who did not take the course seriously; that is,
they did not participate actively in the discussions or did not
do their homework. The tutors also noticed that the course
materials exceeded the reading and comprehension level
of some students. In order to adapt the program to the ado-
lescents, they made some adjustments in the course by, for
example, bringing in more games or change discussion
topics instead of following the program manual strictly.
Because of this, it is difficult to tell whether this study really
evaluated the DISA program in general or only the version
these tutors used. The main instructor (the one who taught
the method to the tutors) claimed that it was not possible
to exclude anything from the program but that there was
some space to bring in extra exercises in order to make the
core content understandable for the students. Questions
about program fidelity must be taken into account in all eva-
luations, but this way of adapting the course might be accep-
table, according to Breitenstein, Robbins, and Cowell
(2012).
The cost of implementing the program for the initial 2 years
was about US$300 per student and course. These costs will fall
as the tutors lead more courses. Also, the time the tutors spend
in planning the course will decrease with time as the tutors
become more used to the program. It is also important to note
that the school in this case did not employ any extra personnel
in order to implement the DISA intervention but instead used
the existing staff. Thus, the extra expenditures for the school
may only include the cost of the head course instructor and
printing costs for student materials (US$50 per student). There
are few calculations of implementation costs in the literature
and none about the DISA course. However, one study calculat-
ing costs for the Coping with Stress course in the United States
found the implementation cost to be US$1632 per student, but
this was an indicated program targeting adolescents at risk for
future depression, and about 65% of the costs were used to
identify at-risk teens and recruit families to the intervention
(Lynch et al., 2005). In a pilot study such as this one, it is not
possible to draw conclusions about possible Qualitative
Adjusted Life Year benefits.
Maintenance
This factor refers to the maintenance of intervention effects
in individuals and settings over time. The 1-year follow-up
effects were discussed previously under the factor efficacy/
effectiveness. The intervention is still being used at the
school during the academic year 2013­2014, which would
demonstrate certain sustainability.

Limitations
In this study, we learned that the instrument measuring depres-
sion, CES-D, was easy for the students to fill out, but in a full-
scale study, it would be preferable to add more questions tar-
geting anxiety and quality of life as well. In a full-scale study,
a control group containing students not participating in the
DISA course is also necessary. More geographic and income
diversity is also needed in a full-scale study. The tutors' claims
thatitwas not alwayseasytostrictlyfollowthemanualsuggest
there is a need for detailed information in a full-scale study
about how the intervention is actually conducted (i.e., program
fidelity). The written comments from the students and tutors
implied that it might be a good idea to conduct interviews in
order to better understand their experiences. Qualitative inter-
views provide more information than short, written comments
(Garmy, Berg & Clausson, 2014). It is not possible to draw any
extensive conclusions from such a small study without a con-
trol group. However, since the literature contains few evalua-
tions of school-based prevention programs, it is of utmost
importance that studies of this sort are employed.
School Nursing Implications
Preventing depressive symptoms in adolescents is an impor-
tant school nursing issue. With the growing recognition of
interdisciplinary interventions, school nurses are in a good
place to bring mental health promotion programs to schools
(Cowell, 2013). In the cognitive behavioral intervention
described in this article, school nurses are often tutors.
School nurses need to critically evaluate the programs that
are employed, either by conducting the evaluations them-
selves or by motivating others--for example, principals or
politicians--to perform them. Unfortunately, there is a great
shortage of evaluations today, which may mean that ineffi-
cient programs will continue to be used, and efficient pro-
grams will remain unknown and unused. We have to
perform evaluations and publish them so that we can learn
from each other and thereby provide the best care for our
children and adolescents at school.
Conclusion
A majority of the students and all of the tutors were satisfied
with the cognitive behavioral intervention preventing depres-
sive symptoms. The students, both females and males, scored
lower on measures of recent depressive symptoms after the
course; and for the females, this was maintained 1-year postin-
tervention. Many students said they had learned a new way of
thinking. The tutors found that the core mission of the course
was to give the students tools for the future. The tutors high-
lighted the advantages of offering the course on a voluntary
basis. They also highlighted practical issues, such as the course
being quite time consuming, and emphasized the importance
of having full support from the school administration when
implementing this sort of program.
Appendix
Illustrative Calculation of the Implementation Costs
Introducing a new program implies a need to allocate
resources to train program tutors and to implement the pro-
gram. From a decision-making perspective, we have made
an illustrative calculation of the costs of the Depression in
Swedish Adolescents (DISA) program implementation using
the figures from the pilot study for time spent on training pro-
gram tutors, preparation, and conducting the 10-week course
with five groups of students. Total cost includes the cost of
training the head instructor. She took two courses for a total
of 48 hr of training: basic training (3 days with 1 day of super-
vision) at US$870 and head instructor training (3 days with
1 day of supervision) at US$1450. She then gave a basic train-
ing course to five colleagues as part of the implementation of
the DISA program: a total of 32 hr of instruction (4 days, 8 hr
per day). Thus, the training time needed for the tutors who
were later to instruct a total of 62 students was, on average,
3.35 hr per student. The students were divided up into five dif-
ferent groups, each with two tutors. Each session required 11
=2
hours of classroom time and 11
=2 hours of preparation time for
each of the two tutors. Thus, each session costs 3 hr per tutor.
Since each course group had 10 sessions of instruction, the
tutor time needed for each group (with two tutors per group)
was 60 hr. The mean number of students in each course group
was 12.4 (62 students in five course groups). The average
tutor time spent per student was thus 4 hr. The total cost of the
course in terms of tutor time per student was thus 7.35 hr (3.35
hr tutor training time and 4 hr of instruction time). The salary
costs were about US$34/hr (including prescribed employer
costs). The course material can be obtained for free on the
Internet, but the costs for making paper copies and for fruit
were about US$13 per student. In total, this gives the sum
of US$300 per student for implementing the DISA program
once in a context similar to the one in this pilot study. Of this,
as much as half the costs are related to the training costs of
DISA tutors, including time and course fees. If these tutors
repeat the DISA program, the average cost per student will
fall. In addition, in this particular setting, the DISA program
was conducted within the current budget, and no extra staff
were employed. The illustrative calculation was based on the
assumption that the opportunity cost of staff time--that is,
the value of the tasks that could not be performed because the
school nurse or school social worker were engaged with the
DISA program--was valued using wages following
the human capital approach (Drummond et al., 2005). Costs
other than wages corresponded to about US$50 per student.
