Abstract
This article assesses the role of the pre-modern past in the construction of political
identities relating to the UK's membership in the European Union by examining
how materials and ideas from Iron Age to Early Medieval Britain and Europe were
leveraged by those who discussed the topic of Brexit in over 1.4 million messages
published in dedicated Facebook pages. Through a combination of data-intensive and
qualitative investigations of textual data, we identify the `heritages' invoked in support
of pro- or anti-Brexit sentiments. We show how these heritages are centred around
myths of origins, resistance and collapse that incorporate tensions and binary
divisions. We highlight the strong influence of past expert practices in shaping such
deeply entrenched dualistic thinking and reflect over the longue dure
´e agency of heri-
tage expertise. This is the first systematic study of public perceptions and experience
of the past in contemporary society undertaken through digital heritage research
fuelled by big data. As such, the article contributes novel methodological approaches
and substantially advances theory in cultural heritage studies. It is also the first pub-
lished work to analyse the role of heritage in the construction of political identities in
relation to Brexit via extensive social research.

Introduction
Research aims
On 23 June 2016, British citizens were called to cast their vote on the subject of the
UK's membership in the European Union (EU) through a referendum that had a
remarkable turnout of 72 per cent of the total electorate (Electoral Commission,
2016; see also Gardner, 2017; Schlanger, 2017 for more discussion on the context of
the referendum and its impact on higher education and the heritage sector). This
voting exercise became the vehicle through which, amongst other things, people
expressed their political identities and crafted `hoped for' political futures
(Marichal, 2013). As such, it provides a powerful case study to examine the
extent to which these identities are tied to the concept of the EU or to alternative
polities and underlying ideologies.
The prominent role of the past in processes of identity construction and decon-
struction has been documented and discussed in a large corpus of literature con-
cerned with cultural heritage studies (in relation to European identities, see e.g.
Carman, 2003; MacDonald, 2012, 2013; Popov and Dea
´ k, 2015; Whitehead et al.,
2015). However, the ways in which ideas and materials from ancient periods are
drawn upon in order to define political selves and negotiate them with others in the
public sphere of today's increasingly Internet-pervaded and networked society
remain largely unexplored. Yet, we argue, the pre-modern heritages of Europe
should be the subject of further investigation, as they permeate many aspects of
our lives (see Alexander et al., 2012; Hall, 2010; Hingley, 2015, 2018 to name but a
few examples) and constitute the origin of myth-making practices that are diffused
within European territories and often extend to much of the contemporary Western
world.
Our article addresses this gap, by assessing how objects, places, practices and
people from Iron Age to Early Medieval Britain and Europe (ca. 800 BC­AD 800)
were leveraged by those who discussed the topic of Brexit in 364 Facebook pages
and a total of over 1.4 million posts, comments and replies published in those
pages. We refer to these uses as the `heritages' that lie at the core of pro- or
anti-Brexit sentiments, and demonstrate the centrality of narratives of origins,
resistance and collapse that are played around tensions between local and global,
indigenous and exogenous, insular and multicultural, civilisation and barbarism.
We draw on this analysis to show how these binaries are sometimes invoked to
uphold opposite positions and highlight the impact of heritage practices from the
past in shaping current dualistic thinking.

Investigating experiences of the past: Conceptual framework
The framework supporting this research rests on four main conceptual pillars that
have been previously but cursorily outlined in Bonacchi et al. (2016), and which are
thus illustrated at greater length in this section. Such pillars constitute the back-
bone of the project `Ancient Identities Today' (Ancient Identities, 2017a), funded
by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and as part of which this study has
been undertaken.
First, we are working with an understanding of heritage as the processes and
outcomes of using, experiencing and generally relating to the past in the present
(Harrison, 2013). This is an interpretation of heritage that cuts across disciplinary
boundaries, material and immaterial legacies, human­object relationships, natural
and cultural heritage resources, and respects and studies their interlinking and
entanglements. Researching contemporary heritages cannot prescind from a joint
investigation of the inheritance of objects, places, practices and people from the
past, as all or any of these can be more or less consciously encountered, selected,
neglected or rehashed, in different ways by different stakeholders, in order to shape
our world. Following from our understanding of heritage as process, here we focus
on examining how heritage is produced through the act of political activism per-
formed on Facebook. Political activism enacted via social media has been the
subject of recent theorisation in the political sciences, with literature usually focus-
ing on assessing the effectiveness of social media to facilitate mobilisation offline
(Gerbaudo, 2012; Morozov, 2009; Shirky, 2011; Velasquez and LaRose, 2015). In
this article, however, we adopt a less-functionalist approach borrowed from
Marichal's idea of `micro-activism' as the kind of political activism that takes
place on social media platforms (Marichal, 2013) and leads to the construction
of `(hoped for) political identities', which may or may not result into social change.
In line with Marichal's view of political `micro-activism', we also understand
Facebook as the field site from which our investigation departs, as well as a part
of the wider public sphere of our society (Habermas, 1997; see also McKee, 2004) ­
we will then refer to it as `Facebooksphere'.
Second, we note the importance of focusing on the longue dure´e when examining
the reception of the past, to better understand the relative values assigned to certain
periods and how these are opposed or equalled. This specific approach has been
successfully utilised to unpack a number of `insistent dualities' that still inform the
ways in which we live the past today (cit. Beard and Henderson, 1999; see Hingley
et al., 2018, for a full discussion of this topic).
Third, we recognise the need to investigate the effects that diverse expert prac-
tices are having on the construction of specific messages, their circulation, prolif-
eration and ultimate moulding into identities. How heritage values are made and
unmade requires research on the politics of expert positions and the extent to which
they filter into `non-professional' actors' lives. The idea of expert practices has
been developed in the context of heritage by Jones and Yarrow (2013: 22),
176 Journal of Social Archaeology 18(2)
to discuss how authenticity is a product of different forms of expertise that interact
in the process of preserving the historic environment. The concept is also central to
the analysis of the role of what Smith and Waterton (2012: 2) have called
Authorised Heritage Discourse (AHD), displayed and communicated by profes-
sionals working in the `officialdom' of research, education, museums, sites, arch-
aeological units and libraries.
Fourth, we take a `quali-quantitative' methodological approach, borrowing
from the work of Venturini and Latour (2010), who use this label to express the
potential of digital methods to suture the division between research on micro- and
macro-structures. Such dichotomy was created by traditional researchers in an
analogue world but does not exist in reality, since micro-structures and macro-
structures `are only two different ways of looking at the same collective canvas, like
the warp and weft of the social fabric'.
Methodology
Methods and workflows
Our quali-quantitative data collection and analysis began with the `navigation' of big
data, characterised by sheer volume, velocity, variety, variability and flexibility, by
exhaustive scope, fine-grained resolution and relational nature (Kitchin, 2013, 2014).
In undertaking this research, we have been confronted with the need to delve in
`big data' using automated approaches in order to identify Facebook pages about
Brexit, but the information contained in these pages and featuring ideas about the
past did not possess some of the features described by Kitchin (2013, see above). Its
volume and velocity, for instance, were not very large, albeit probably greater than
in most heritage studies conducted to date. Data-intensive methods were thus used
primarily as means of exploring Facebook as a field of ethnographic investigation
in a non-traditional but nevertheless fully immersive manner (Hine, 2015). It is this
immersive and exploratory character that defines the data-intensive approaches we
have used as (unconventionally) ethnographic.
Amongst social media, we chose Facebook due to its popularity across different
socio-demographics (Velasquez and LaRose, 2015), and for the richness of its data
and metadata (e.g. compared to Twitter). An additional reason was that this social
medium allows users to set up public pages to host discussions on specific themes
and lets researchers extract their content through its Application Programming
Interface (API). Furthermore, according to a recent report, `approximately 63%
of [Facebook] users acquire their news from social media, and these news stories
undergo the same popularity dynamics as other forms of online contents' (cit. in
Del Vicario et al., 2017). Facebook, thus, provides an ideal space for studying the
rehashing of ideas by stakeholders and their circulation across media and plat-
forms. As part of our ethics statement, we note that pages and messages ­ including
posts, comments and replies ­ were accessed via the Facebook API, and mined with
R software.
Bonacchi et al. 177
Over the months of March and April 2017, we extracted the content of public
Facebook pages featuring the word Brexit in their title or description and contain-
ing posts, comments or replies published from 6 May 2010 to 30 April 2017
(Table 1, online Appendix). 6 May 2010 was the day of the General Election
that led to the establishment of the Coalition government, during which the
option of a possible referendum on the UK's membership in the EU was first
proposed. We used a set of 569 period-specific keywords relating to Iron Age,
Roman and Early Medieval places and people of Britain, in order to locate mes-
sages that would be likely to reference the aforementioned pasts in the context of
Brexit. These keywords included the names of Iron Age tribes and chiefs, Roman
emperors and Anglo-Saxon kings, Roman towns, Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon
settlements in Britain, as well as general terms describing the period from 800
BC to AD 800. A full list of the keywords that were used is made available
online (Ancient Identities, 2017b) and was compiled via desktop research and
vetted through history and archaeology handbooks and listings of sites provided
by heritage organisations such as English Heritage, Historic Scotland and Cadw.
The posts, comments and replies identified in this way were then verified manually.
In the first phase of the analysis, we examined the metadata of the 364 Facebook
pages about Brexit that had been previously extracted, to understand the motiv-
ations behind their set up and the context of their use; this metadata consisted of
ID (unique numeric value), About (short introduction), Category, Description,
General Info, Likes, Link (associated with the page), City, State, Country,
Latitude, Longitude, Name, Talking About, Username and Website.
Subsequently, we created a corpus composed of all the posts, comments and replies
from the 364 Facebook pages and performed topic modelling to uncover the
hidden thematic structure of the corpus. This method has been successfully
employed before to map out the content of large collections of documents, includ-
ing historical sources (Newman and Block, 2006; Yang et al., 2011), social media
interactions (e.g. Marwick, 2013) or scholarly blogging platforms (Puschmann and
Bastos, 2015), without using a priori categories. In particular, we applied Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular probabilistic topic modelling algorithm
that, for each of a pre-determined and optimal number of topics, outputs a set
of words accompanied by values that represent the probability of each word to be
associated with the given topic (Blei et al., 2010, 2003). The model was executed
using the Python Natural Language Toolkit and Gensim library (Rehurek and
Sojka, 2010), and the optimal number of topics was estimated to be 25 by calculat-
ing topic coherence scores as described in Ro
¨ der et al. (2015). Topics were labelled
independently by the authors and then discussed and agreed; each label was
assigned so that it would describe the overall association of the 20 terms with
the highest probability scores.
We repeated topic modelling on the subset of data containing the 569 period-
specific keywords (also referred to as `data subset', from now on) and compared the
21 topics detected in this smaller dataset to the 15 featuring in the Brexit
Facebooksphere as a whole. Thereafter, we calculated term frequencies and carried
178 Journal of Social Archaeology 18(2)
out association analysis (0.30 < coefficient) for the data subset, in order to under-
stand how the past was called upon, which ideas were recurring more frequently
and any related concepts. Messages containing keywords about the Iron Age,
Roman and Early Medieval periods were not posted by a handful of individuals
and the great majority of posters were `mono-posters' (2528 messages with past
specific keywords were written by 1909 users). Most users posted only one message,
while 279 users posted more than one message and only 26 more than five mes-
sages. We also discovered that most messages were posted only once, with only 86
out of 2528 messages posted more than once and up to 15 times (in one case only).
Given the low number of multi-posters and multi-posted messages and their min-
imal impact on the analysis, no filters were applied to account for them.
Finally, we undertook qualitative analysis to gain in-depth knowledge of rele-
vant messages and the influence of heritage expert practices on the discussion. All
the messages containing the most recurring past-specific terms were examined via
close reading. The thematic threads identified in this way (myths) are presented in
the `Myths and dualities' section and exemplified via relevant extracts chosen for
their significance. These extracts have been contextualised as much as possible, with
information about the author, the page where they were posted and the thread to
which they belonged (if any). Deeper grounding could only be provided through
further and smaller scale investigations such as posting an anonymous survey on all
or a sample of the Facebook pages, or conducting offline ethnographic research
with the Brexit-related groups that have a presence beyond the Facebooksphere;
this work, however, transcends the scope of this paper and the space allowed, thus
we aim to integrate it in future.1
The Brexit Facebooksphere: Context of study
We worked to characterise the Brexit Facebooksphere by investigating how and
why this space was set up by collectives and individuals. Half of the pages were
created by groups already established offline and variously built around shared
place, party, institutional affiliation, job, related interests, social concerns, nation-
ality and voting preference (Table 2, online Appendix). The majority of these
groups were based in Britain and this fact, together with the languages used to
communicate (Table 3, online Appendix), suggests interactions involving primarily
­ although not exclusively ­ UK-based social actors. Additionally, it indicates that,
for the most part, the Facebooksphere of Brexit was tightly connected with mobil-
isation undertaken offline. Since Facebook-enabled and in-person activism seem to
be interlinked, there might be continuity in the ways in which the past is leveraged
and heritage is produced within and beyond Facebook pages. This is not to say that
this analysis is formally representative of the `population' of activists involved in
Brexit referendum discussions, but that some of the repertoires that we will exam-
ine are certainly not confined to social media; rather, they are variously embedded
in the cultures of some of the communities located in the four UK countries of
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Bonacchi et al. 179
Based on the qualitative analysis of the metadata available, we studied the main
reasons why individuals and the aforementioned groups created Facebook pages
focusing on Brexit (Tables 4 and 5, online Appendix). From these, 67 out of the
209 pages containing messages that featured period-specific keywords were estab-
lished for the purpose of campaigning for either the Leave or Remain camp,
whereas 52 pages intended to provide news without taking sides. Substantially
lower is the number of pages that used the Brexit label to brand and market a
product, or those that wished to present and debate specific initiatives, provide a
space for general discussion or for humour and satire. This motivational horizon
shows how the creators of these Facebook pages understood the latter's role in the
construction of political identities. In most cases, Facebook was used to illustrate
and support existing ideas and projects; others turned to it to create a genuinely
neutral and democratic arena to acquire and respond to any information provided
about the referendum and participate in dialogue. The Brexit Facebooksphere thus
comprises but does not only consist of pages that are dedicated to host exchanges
of views and opinions. This is in line with the general findings of Del Vicario et al.
(2017), who studied the interaction of one million Facebook users with Brexit-
related posts from January to July 2016, and identified the existence of two distinct
and separate groups acting as echo chambers and holding different perceptions of
the same topics.
The past in the Brexit Facebooksphere
Topics
The topic modelling of all the messages extracted from Brexit-focused Facebook
pages shows that discussions in the Facebooksphere covered subjects ranging
widely from social welfare to the economy, international relations, mobility, other-
ness and (in)security; assessments of the costs and benefits of the referendum; and
voting procedures (Figure 1 and Table 6, online Appendix). Differently, the the-
matic structure of the period-specific data subset was less varied and centred on
mobility, origins, identity, cultural tension, security and nationalism (Figure 2 and
Table 7, online Appendix).
The past was leveraged in relation to certain issues more than others, and espe-
cially to the movement of people, their subsequent interactions and the threats and
opportunities caused by these dynamics in terms of identity and law and order.
Mobility is the thematic origin and trigger of the heritages of Brexit and one of the
contemporary issues to which Western societies relate by drawing upon the past
(see also Hingley et al., 2018).
Amongst the keywords that were used, the ones recurring more frequently in the
data subset of 2529 posts, comments and replies are Roman, britannia and barbar
(featuring at least 300 times), followed by hadrian (appearing 200 times), and
mediev and norman (present 100 times) (Table 8, online Appendix). These results
highlight the prominence of ideas related to the Roman period compared to the
180 Journal of Social Archaeology 18(2)

medieval past. The word Roman, in particular, appeared only once in the majority
of messages that contained it (249) and is associated with terms expressing power
dynamics (e.g. inferior, superior) or related to mobility and discrimination (e.g.
xenofobia, discrimin, racism, jute), militarisation, occupation and resistance (e.g.
occupi, soldier, victori, coloni, armi, conquer, defend) (Table 9, online Appendix).
Consistently, Britannia is associated with words from the song Rule, Britannia!,
which features often in the corpus (Table 9, online Appendix). This is a patriotic
song derived from a poem by James Thomson, which was set to music in 1740, and
opposes the freedom of Britannia and Britons to the situation of nations governed
by envious tyrants. The latter have been interpreted by some as a reference to the
absolutism that was still characterising European monarchies in the 18th century,
whereas Britain had already curbed royal prerogative and developed a constitu-
tional democracy. Furthermore, according to Armitage (2000: 173), the song was
an expression of the ideas behind the British Empire `predicated on a mixture of
adulterated mercantilism, nationalistic anxiety and libertarian fervour'. Today,
most citizens are not perhaps aware of these historical roots, but remain conscious
of the strong nationalistic meaning of the song, so that the prominent use of the
word Britannia in the context of nationalist hymning can be interpreted as estab-
lishing a direct link between the ancient identity of the Roman province and ideas
of British imperialism, independence and economic success.
Myths and dualities
In order to more closely qualify how Roman times were called upon, we proceeded
with a qualitative exploration of the subset of data containing the keyword Roman.
This analysis was aimed at exploring the diversity of ways in which the period
under examination was leveraged. The research revealed the centrality and frequent
recurrence of a parallel drawn between the EU and the Roman Empire and of three
main myths, constructed through binaries that, for the most part, contrast the
Roman Empire to other periods and polities.
1. Myths of origin. The first myth of origin leverages the Roman past along the
lines of Kristian Kristiansen's conceptualisation of European origins (1996). The
narrative is focused on the civilising power of the Roman Empire (equalled to
the EU), invoked within the pro-remain camp to support the UK's membership
in the EU. For example, a user writes on the pro-leave page `Pro Britain' that:
`Well, if it wan't for the Roman empire, you would ve be still barbarians living in
huts, still pillaging between ur selves, still in stone age! You say you invented the
gentleman? That a joke! [. . .]!'
This idea is likely to be originally rooted in academic thinking and literature pre-
dating the post-colonial turn of the 1980­90s (Hingley, 2015) and is refused by
those pro-leavers who stress that the process of Romanisation of Britain, often
portrayed as pacific and beneficial, was actually characterised by violence and
182 Journal of Social Archaeology 18(2)
oppression. To build this argument, a user mentions the Roman occupation
together with Norman invasions, showing how very different realities and past
situations can be juxtaposed to back narratives that are already present in the
mind of an individual. In particular, he writes the following sarcastic post, as a
reply to a message made public by the pro-remain page `Very British Problems' on
`Mayhem government using tried and tested methods to maintain the purity of
Brexit Britain':
Going back to the original post, I love your description of our ``cultural enrichment''
at the hands of the Romans and Normans, though I doubt few of the contemporary
inhabitants would have seen it that way. [. . .] first the Romans turn up with some
really nice homemade biccies and a big slice of rape and murder. . .things pick up a
little later when the Normans arrive with a cheeky red and a nice dose of oppression,
whilst stirring up racial hatred between the Celts and non Celtic people's that still
hasn't receded to this day. . . [. . .] If you're going to make the case for the EU, it's
probably best NOT to mention Britain's history with Europe!
Differently, the second myth of origin that emerges from the data subset identifies
the indigenous origin of Britain in the barbaric peoples who came before or after
the establishment of the Roman province of Britannia. When the roots of the
nation are placed in the post-Roman period, English, British and Celtic identities
feature, and the first two are often in opposition to each other. This is exemplified
by the words of a user who replied to a Mail Online article entitled `Teeth
checks make me ashamed to be British, says Diane Abbott: MPs accuse Shadow
Home Secretary of being out of touch with voters following her comments'
(Brown, 2016), which was posted on the page `Brexit News'. Commenting on
Abbot, the user said:
She is not british tho she is african british. She is a migrants or the descendent of a
migrant, she has no say on britian. Only the descendent of those who build this nation
up from the fall of the Roman Empire have a say. We are called native brits.
Emphasis on pre-Roman origins is also evidenced in the data subset, as in the case
of a contributor, who was replying to a post published on the page `Pro Great
Britain' about Farage supposedly celebrating as Juncker admitted Britain was `in
control': `Smoke and mirrors bullshit from Junckers. RULE BRITANNIA! We
fucked off the Romans, (eventually, have to say), Made the French/Viking/
Norsemen Normans, change their names and get Anglicisised, to proper English
names. [. . .]' A third myth stresses the mixed and, in the words of one of the
participants in the Facebook discussions, `non-pure' origins of Britain, and is
used to support the Remain position, as in the example below.
England was a microcosm of Europe even in those early days. Britons were of Greek
descent, Welsh, Irish were also part Greek and Scythian. Scots picts, were remnants of
Bonacchi et al. 183
Scythia, even as their name reads. Danes, Saxons, Normans, Angles, from Germanic
heartlands, and northern Skane naval lands. Romans founded Londinium.
This text was posted as a reply to the only post in the whole of the data subset
containing period-specific keywords that quoted an article specifically about heri-
tage. The latter focused on the Anglo-Saxons and was written by the historical
fiction writer Martin Wall (2016) in the BBC History Magazine. It was utilised to
reiterate and ­ via selective referencing ­ support a narrative about British and
Celts being indigenous people. The article is referenced to back the idea of Anglo-
Saxons as conquerors, in opposition to the native `British' population, but the
author only draws on those parts of the text that back his thesis. For example,
he ignores the passage stressing the possibility that Anglo-Saxons might have been
initially invited by the local population to help fighting the Picts, or that Anglo-
Saxon tribes frequently fought among themselves.
2. Myths of resistance. Myths of resistance characterise both the EU and Roman
Empire as dominant polities that deprive populations of their freedom, some-
times also compared to Nazi Germany. An Indonesian national living in
Washington, for example, explained the reasons behind Brexit by posting, on
the page `Pro Great Britain', a message stating that `Exit is the only solution'
after Britain has been `bullied to join this ``roman empire'' with no constitution
in place yet'. In another case, a user replied to a post referencing the Sunday
Express article entitled `Bratislava 2016: ``Show some respect'' Hungary blasts
EU for deceiving nations with ``tricks''` (Kegl, 2016), with these words:
If the people of the 27 countries don't react soon they are going to find themselves
living in a Dictatorship ruled over by a select few bent on personal power and wealth.
Reminds me of the Roman Empire or should I say `The Fourth Rike'.
The authors of these Facebook messages see the Brexit referendum as an oppor-
tunity to resist by voting Leave, and, in some cases, Boudica or (retrospectively) the
British Empire are invoked also as symbols of such resistance to Rome and the EU:
[. . .] I understand it is now clear that the New Roman Empire has Invaded Britain and
whole British Empire and hence Commonwealth was formed by our ancestors in fear
of this situation. It is history of British Commonwealth, which was formed to meet the
demand of WW2 to survive against European invasion. [. . .] [User from London
commenting on a post by Brexit News on `High court ruling puts Brexit in the
balance'].
3. Myths of collapse. Myths of collapse revolve around the idea of the `fall' of the
Roman Empire/EU or Britain, if the latter remains in the EU. Here we find a
choice of terminology (e.g. fall, collapse) that aligns with interpretations of the
passage from the Roman to the post-Roman period as a break, and, in places,
184 Journal of Social Archaeology 18(2)
echoes the title of Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire (1789). The reasons that are mentioned as the possible causes for
this `fall', however, are varied and include migrations and integration of bar-
barian/foreign peoples (as Gibbon's thesis also argued), the fact that empires are
naturally destined to end, expansionism, economic decline, centralisation, bur-
eaucracy and excessive regulation. Myths of collapse are mostly, but not exclu-
sively, used to support pro-Leave positions. For example, a pro-leave user
comments in these terms on a post by Pro Great Britain that reports the results
of a YouGov poll on whether Britain's decision to leave the EU had been right
or wrong: `The Roman Empire collapsed as hordes of barbarians assimilated
into their culture - the Franks, the Visigoths, the Vandals etc etc And now
hordes of coarse barbarians from the East are arriving into the UK every
week.' As for some of the previous myths, parallels are often extended to
other polities besides the Roman Empire and the EU. Again, this shows that
comparable images and situations are searched across centuries and juxtaposed
very simply (simplistically?), by both Brexiteers and Remainers:
Anyone who voted to remain and still crying, should remember throughout history,
all empires were built to fall. Being British we should know that better than most.
(Remember the Roman Empire? USSR?). [Post of a self-declared leave campaigner,
published in the page `Pro Great Britain']
However after a few centuries of Britain, Brexit will be the turning point of the final
chapter of the UK. I believe that Britain like the Habsburg Empire, Yugoslavia,
USSR, the Ottoman or Byzantine or Roman Empire, is on its final chapter. Brexit
will bring a gradual economic decline, followed by secession of Scotland, NI,
Gibraltar and finally Wales, so England itself will eventually return to the EU and
join the Eurozone before 2030. [Greek national commenting on a post published on
the page `Brexit' about the possible end of the EU as a result of a `bomb effect'
triggered by Brexit]
Discussion
The analysis undertaken in this paper has shown the role of discourse around the
pre-Roman, Roman and post-Roman world in the making of political identities
related to Brexit and the centrality of notions of imperialism in this context. These
findings resonate with the part that the above-mentioned periods have played in the
very formation of the EU. As noted by Hingley, for example, the idea of the EU
has drawn extensively on that of the Roman Empire, especially as regards the
pursuing of frontier integration and multiculturalism (Hingley, 2018; Hingley
et al., 2018). Furthermore, the study has offered supporting evidence for the
hypothesis proposed by Andrew Gardner (2017), that a relation exists between
the void left by the end of the British Empire, the rejection of Britishness, the
Bonacchi et al. 185
embracing of regional identities that roughly overlap with those of pre-Roman
local groupings and the choice to vote for Brexit. This tension between supra-
national structures and regional ones lies at the core of the ways in which individ-
uals and groups relate to the past in order to address social issues today.
The friction between global and local realities is connected with a number of
other `insistent dualities' that are invoked in political micro-activism performed on
social media. As explained in a previous article (Hingley et al., 2018), the concept of
`insistent dualities' refers to all those oppositions through which the past can be
interpreted by contemporary stakeholders. It is a notion framed by Beard and
Henderson (1999) in relation to Boudica/Boadicea and the ways in which the
Roman occupation of Britain has been perceived. In particular, the authors ask
whether Roman Britain is `Roman or native', `British or foreign', `part of the
seamless web of our island story or an ignominious period of enemy occupation',
`the origins of (European) civilization on our shores, or an unpleasant, artificial
intrusion that actually managed to postpone (British) civilization for almost a
thousand years' (Beard and Henderson, 1999: 47).
Our analysis has revealed how dualities concerning civilisation and barbarism,
indigenous and exogenous, cultural integration and insularity are utilised to shape
political identities in the context observed. These binaries are leveraged to mould
the three myths ­ of origin, resistance and collapse ­ through which people support
their positions on Brexit and on mobility and border control more at large. These
myths are frequently leveraged to back opposed views in very simple terms, and
often extending parallels and comparisons to more recent periods. The pattern of
framing the present by drawing on multiple periods simultaneously confirms the
validity of the longue dure´e approach that informs this research, and that it is
crucial to study public experiences of the past without regarding the latter as a
closed and packaged entity relegated to distant dimensions.
The myths that characterise the ways in which the ancient world features in
discussions about Brexit seem to have been fed and nurtured by past expert prac-
tices in the arenas of education, media and communication and heritage (the AHD
mentioned at the beginning). The very prominence of the Roman world, compared
to the Iron Age period or, to a lesser extent, the Middle Ages, is likely to rest on the
high visibility that has been given to it in the National Curriculum for schools in
England (Hingley et al., 2018). In fact, the idea of the Roman Empire, its forma-
tion, development and `end' has been discussed as tightly linked to the destiny of
the EU in archaeological, and other social science literature, but the same has
happened for the Holy Roman Empire. The latter, for example, has been identified
by some commentators in the political sciences and historical disciplines as com-
parable to the EU due to its permeable frontiers, polycentric government and
`devolution' model ante litteram (Henry, 2010; Wilson, 2016; Zielonka, 2011).
Nevertheless, it appears only very seldom in the data subset we analysed.
From 1989 onwards, the National Curriculum in England has also contributed
to characterise the Roman Empire as both an invader and a strong and civilising
military power that has brought progress and advancement to Britain, thus
186 Journal of Social Archaeology 18(2)
restating an idea of Roman origins that has had some currency since at least the
Victorian and Edwardian period (Hingley, 2000; Hingley et al., 2018). Over the dec-
ades, the factual end of television programming has massively built on a widely
diffused idea of the Roman world as positive and beneficial, proposing programmes
and series that align with this image and further reinforce it (Hingley et al., 2018). We
have encountered the reception of televised discourse, for example in relation to the
series `What the Romans Did for Us' (Wilkinson, 2001), which was mentioned as
supporting evidence for pro-Remain positions. Education, in turn, is often largely
influenced by the AHD that is palpable through museum displays, on-site interpret-
ations and educational talks given to school pupils (Sharpe, 2017) ­ to name but a few
examples. These narratives tend towards stasis rather than swift adaptation, and often
end up communicating the results of outdated interpretations of the past. It is thus not
surprising that the National Curriculum is still constructed on the notion of
Romanisation, despite the critique to which the latter has been subject for over
three decades, as a result of post-colonialist reflections (Hingley et al., 2018).
As a way forward, we suggest the myths and repertoires of images and symbols we
have exposed can be used to facilitate dialogue between heritage `professionals' and
citizens over the meanings of the past and their implications in relation to issues of
autonomy, mobility and border control. This is a kind of communication that res-
onates with both rationality- and emotion-driven decision-making processes in what
has been recently defined a `post-truth society'. The use of the term post-truth peaked
precisely in 2016, concomitantly with the Brexit referendum and the US Presidential
elections; it describes people's tendency to rely strongly on peer-to-peer communica-
tions enabled by social media, basing their choices on beliefs more than `facts'
(Higgins, 2016; Oxford Dictionaries, 2017). The myths that are typically used to
construct and express political identities in national or supranational (European)
terms possess an immediacy that can be quickly evoked. At the same time, the very
factthatthemyths wehaveencounteredaresolidlygroundedin expertpracticesof the
past paradoxically contrasts with the idea of a loss of faith in expert and authoritative
knowledge, to the point of challenging the very validity of post-truth as a notion.
Conclusions
The analysis presented in these pages should not be considered as necessarily
limited to Facebook, because it shows strong connections with some of the
places and regions of Britain and with groups that operate in those areas. Brexit-
related discussions on Facebook have drawn on landmarks such as Hadrian's Wall,
and fully unleashed their multiple values as both natural and cultural, tangible and
intangible, object- and practice-centred heritages. Our research has then empha-
sised the viability of the concept of `context of heritage production', as the kind of
human activity, here exemplified by political activism, that can potentially unfold
across both online and offline fields. The adoption of this concept and of quality-
quantitative methodologies allows scoping dynamics regarding the public experi-
ence of the past that may also continue in those parts of our everyday lives where
Bonacchi et al. 187
the Internet is absent. On- and off-line, ideas tied to the Roman past and imperi-
alism have been leveraged to frame `simple' myths of origin, resistance and collapse
in support of either or both of the pro-leave and pro-remain camps. Materials,
practices and places from the ancient past are linked to modern times and used to
discuss matters that relate to identity and otherness in ways that reveal the longue
dure´e impact of past heritage expertise.
