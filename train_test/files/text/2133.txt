Diabetes's `Health Shock' To
Schooling And Earnings: Increased
Dropout Rates And Lower Wages
And Employment In Young Adults
ABSTRACT Despite a growing diabetes crisis, the nonmedical implications
for young adults have gone virtually unexplored. We investigated the
effects of diabetes on two key outcomes for this age group--schooling and
earnings--and found that it delivers an increasingly common "health
shock" to both. We identified effects in several measures of educational
attainment, including a high school dropout rate that was six percentage
points higher than among young adults without the disease. We also
found lower employment and wages: A person with diabetes can
conservatively expect to lose more than $160,000 over his or her working
life, compared to a peer without the disease. For young adults with
diabetes, having a parent with diabetes also leads to poorer outcomes
than if one more parents do not have the disease--for example, reducing
the likelihood of attending college by four to six percentage points, even
after the child's health status is controlled for. These results highlight the
urgency of attacking this growing health problem, as well as the need for
measures such as in-school screening for whether diabetes's impact on
individual learning and performance begins before the classic
manifestations of clinical diabetes appear.
The United States continues to be
enmeshed in a chronic disease
crisis. Major contributors to the
problem are obesity and its con-
sequences, including diabetes. Cur-
rently, diabetes affects more than twenty-three
million people, or just under 8 percent of the US
population.1,2 Its prevalence continues to swell as
it tracks the commensurate rise in obesity.3­8
Moreover, America's children appear to be in-
creasingly affected by both obesity and
diabetes.7,9
These trends have not gone unnoticed. A
large literature has been devoted to the eco-
nomic and human costs of obesity,6,10­14 with a
smaller but burgeoning field devoted to diabe-
tes.15­19 Much of this prior work demonstrates
increases in medical care use and spending in
tandem with the growing burdens of these two
diseases.3,11­13,16,20,21 Yet nonmedical con-
sequences are also important to consider.
In conducting this study, our objective was to
produce new estimates of the nonmedical eco-
nomic burden for the young adult population.
Specifically, we aimed to elucidate some of the
educational and labor-market outcomes associ-
ated with having diabetes and, in so doing, pro-
duce a picture of the short- and long-term eco-
nomic effects of developing diabetes in
adolescence or early adulthood.
Although we are not the first to explore these
issues, our work has several unique character-
istics that complement previous analyses. Two
prominent points of departure relate to the age
groups and structure of our data set. Whereas
most former research18,19,22­24 focused on older

populations, we investigated a longitudinal sam-
ple containing detailed information on Ameri-
ca's adolescents and young adults.We controlled
for family and environmental factors that may
have contributed to outcomes such as less
schooling, lower wages, and higher unemploy-
ment, and we traced the effects of diabetes dur-
ing the transition to adulthood. Because the tim-
ing of the nonmedical effects of diabetes has not
been the focus of previous literature, the eco-
nomicconsequences of diabetes for young adults
is both an understudied and a potentially impor-
tant aspect for research and policy making.
Consistent with prior literature, we found
meaningful, negative effects of diabetes on years
of schooling and various employment outcomes
for people diagnosed fairly early in life. We also
highlight the importance of addressing con-
founding factors--such as environmental influ-
ences--that increase both disease risk and the
likelihood of poor adult outcomes.
On average, the high school dropout rate
among people with diabetes is approximately
six percentage points higher than the rate
among people who do not have the disease. This
difference is larger than the black-white and
male-female differences in the general popula-
tion and tracks the effects of childhood atten-
tion-deficit hyperactivity disorder.25 By age
thirty, a person with diabetes can expect a ten-
percentage-point reduction in the likelihood of
being employed and annual earnings penalties
of up to $6,000 when employed. Equally impor-
tant, our results demonstrate that the con-
sequences of diabetes can manifest themselves
early in life, with implications for the future of
the individual patient and society.
Study Data And Limitations
Data We used data from the National Longitudi-
nal Study of Adolescent Health, which was con-
ducted by researchers at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. This study was first
fielded in 1994­95 as a nationally representative,
school-based study of the health-related behav-
iors of adolescents and their effects in young
adulthood. Data were collected in four waves
of in-home interviews.Wave 1 sampled students
in grades 7­12 in 1994­95, and the study fol-
lowed up with interviews of the same students
approximately one year (wave 2, in 1996), seven
years (wave 3, in 2001­02), and fourteen years
(wave 4, in 2008) later.
In all, approximately 15,000 subjects were fol-
lowed over the four waves. By wave 4, the respon-
dents were on average nearly thirty years old.
Thus, the survey offers a unique window onto
the potential accumulation of economic burden
as children and adolescents transition into
adulthood.
All four waves of the survey collected data on a
variety of health conditions, such as obesity,
symptoms of depression, and low birthweight.
However, information on self-reported diabetes
status was not collected until wave 4. The key
question posed to respondents in that wave
was, "Has a doctor, nurse, or other health care
provider ever told you that you have or had high
blood sugar or diabetes?" Those answering yes
for either condition were also asked for their age
at diagnosis.26
We compared the outcomes of respondents
with self-reported diabetes to those of their peers
who did not report havingthe disease.Because of
data limitations, we are unable to confidently
differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Key adult outcomes include the educational
and labor-market outcomes collected at wave
4. Educational outcomes include self-reports of
completed years of schooling, high school drop-
out status, and college attendance. Labor-market
outcomes include self-reported employment sta-
tus; annual earnings; participation in a social
program such as welfare, public housing, and
food stamp assistance;27,28 and any health-related
absences from work within the previous month.
Strengths Of The Data As noted elsewhere,29
a strength of panel data such as those in this
survey--particularly in the context of studying
diabetes--is that the data allow researchers to
control for environmental and circumstantial
influences that could otherwise confound a
study's results. In other words, we aimed to ac-
count for external factors to the best of our abil-
ity, thus preventing them from contaminating
our estimated effects.
Unlike many surveys, the National Longitudi-
nal Study of Adolescent Health allows consider-
ation of several important influences, including
a broad set of potential comorbidities (for exam-
ple, obesity measures at fourdifferent times) and
family background factors (for example, paren-
tal education attainment, income, and diabetes
and obesitystatus). Inaddition,theschool-based
study design allows the comparison of high
school classmates so that common influences--
such as local labor-market factors, school qual-
ity, peer groups, and environmental health haz-
ards--can be held constant in the analysis.30
We used these data features to estimate the
statistically adjusted differences in adult out-
comes between people diagnosed with diabetes
and those without that diagnosis. We demon-
strated the importance of controlling for these
factors by contrasting three types of models:
baseline statistical models with limited control
variables; models that use a broader set of con-

trol variables; and models that directly compare
former high school classmates who had similar
family backgrounds and health characteristics.
An additional strength of our data is that they
allow us to follow individual subjects from the
mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. In contrast, much
of the literature relies exclusively on data from
the 1980s and 1990s or examines people at older
ages than our study did.
Limitations As noted above, we were unable
to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes
in our data set. However, the absence of such a
distinction should not be considered a major
problem. Commonalities between the two types
continue to emerge as clinical knowledge of dia-
betes evolves.4,5,8,31 These common features fur-
ther blur the line between the two, if in fact one
exists at all.5,31,32
Additionally, the outcomes that we investi-
gated should be widespread among people with
diabetes. Nonetheless, future data sources
capable of credibly distinguishing between the
two types may identify differences in their effects
and causal mechanisms.
Study Results
Using the weighted wave 4 data yields a diabetes
prevalence rate of 2.6 percent, which tracks
other estimates for a comparable age group.15
Exhibit 1 shows selected characteristics of our
sample. For each analysis, we incorporated the
wave 4 survey weights to produce nationally
representative estimates. We clustered our re-
gression standard errors at the high school level
to account for any within-school correlation in
unobserved characteristics. Complete details on
the estimation procedure and full results from
each empirical model are available in the online
Appendix.33
Education Effects Our study supports the
evidence from the literature,17,18,22 and our re-
search design and data indicate declines in edu-
cation, employment, and earnings for those di-
agnosed with diabetes during their adolescent or
early adulthood years. Exhibit 2 outlines the
nexus of our schooling results and incorporates
several strategies to address concerns about po-
tential confounding at the individual, family,
and community levels.
When controlling for basic demographic fac-
tors, we found that respondents with diabetes
completed 0.675 fewer years of schooling than
their peers whodid nothavediabetes. This differ-
ence shrank by 22 percent when we controlled
for family background. It shrank by a further
15 percent when we controlled for comorbid
obesity status and another 7 percent when we
controlled for the following additional prevalent
comorbid illnesses: attention deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder, depression, and asthma.
Furthermore,wefoundan additional3percent
reduction when we controlled for parents' dia-
betes and obesity and another 16 percent reduc-
tion when we controlled for childhood environ-
mental confounding factors. All told, we reduced
the educational difference by 62 percent of the
baseline estimates, which indicates that our es-
timates in the final column probably best reflect
the direct effect of diabetes.
Even with modifications for potential con-

founding, our final estimate of 0.254 years of
schooling reduction (Exhibit 2) represents an
important decrease in human capital. For exam-
ple, this difference is nearly twice the magnitude
of the black-white schooling disparity in our
data. It is also nearly as large as the difference
between children who grow up with married pa-
rents and those whose parents were not married
(0.298 years). In addition, combining our most
conservative estimates with the nationally
representative weights available in the data to
extrapolate our results to the general population
for this age group, we calculated that diabetes
reduces human capital by nearly 150,000 school-
ing years for this set of cohorts.
We also found evidence of a substantial in-
crease in the risk of dropping out of high school
(five to seven percentage points) and reduced
college attendance (eight to thirteen percentage
points) (Exhibit 2). Here, too, controls for con-
founding wereimportant, shrinkingthe baseline
estimates by 25 percent and 40 percent for drop-
ping out of high school and attending college,
respectively.
To offer some context, prior estimates place
the total lifetime costs to society at between
$243,000 and $388,000 per high school drop-
out.34 Increasingthedropoutriskby5percentage
points for the 570,000 young people with diabe-
tes represented in our sample suggests a pre-
dicted increase of nearly 30,000 high school
dropouts because of diabetes. That results in
an estimated overall cost to society of $7­11 bil-
lion during the dropouts' lifetimes.

Labor-Market Effects In Exhibit 3 we
present labor-market differences by diabetes sta-
tus. We first show reductions in employment of
8­11 percentage points among people with dia-
betes.We also found an increase of 8­13 percent-
age points in participation in social programs.
For respondents with jobs, we found increases of
10 percentage points in the likelihood of re-
ported absences due to health problems.We also
found reductions in yearly earnings of $1,500­
6,000. Importantly, statistically addressing con-
founding reduced the associations for labor-
market outcomes by 20­70 percent.
There is a close and complex relationship be-
tween work, health insurance, and medical care.
We attempted to disentangle these interactions
to some degree by examining the differential
impacts of diabetes on wages based on health
insurance coverage and type. We stratified our
analyses by type of insurance coverage at wave 4.
Among people with private insurance, those
with diabetes were more likely than their peers
without diabetes to report having been absent
from work in the previous month because of
health (Exhibit 4). This is not the case for people
who report having no health insurance. In addi-
tion, only among people with private health in-
surance did we find evidence of an earnings dis-
advantage for diabetes.35
Additional Consequences Of Diabetes Our
analysis so far has considered only the short-
term implications of diabetes for a population
of young adults.We next outline longer-term and
intergenerational effects that should be ad-
dressed in future research.
Assuming that the annual wage effects remain
constant as people age, we extrapolated our re-
sults to obtain an estimate of the lifetime earn-
ings penalty from diabetes. Assuming a forty-
year working life, this figure would be
$160,000 per person. Because the survey respon-
dents were about age thirty in wave 4, they had
not reached their peak earning potential. Thus,
this figure is probably an underestimate.28
Intergenerational effects are another conse-
quence of diabetes. Prior research on other
health outcomes has typically taken the ap-
proach of assessing whether or not parents
and children share similar health profiles be-
cause of mechanisms such as genetics, environ-
ment, and health behaviors, singly or in combi-
nation.29 Our preliminary analysis--which we
plan to expand in future research--is unique
in its finding that young adults whose parents
had diabetes have poorer outcomes than their
peers whose parents did not have the disease.
For example, we found that having a parent
with diabetes reduced thelikelihood of attending
college by four to six percentage points, even
when the child's health status was controlled
for. Similarly, we found that having a father with
diabetes reduced the likelihood of employment
at age thirty by approximately seven percentage
points (datanot shown). These results imply that
diabetes has important and previously unexam-
ined consequences that should be the subject of
future work.
Discussion
Diabetes has a marked effect on educational and
labor-market outcomes. Moreover, there is evi-
dence that many of the negative effects are felt
early in life. By age thirty, many people with
diabetes are already on a lower employment tra-
jectory--in part because of reduced education--
which paints a sobering picture for a nation with
a growing burden of disease.
Although our data do not allow us to probe
further into the mechanisms driving our results,
several potential causes might well explain some
of these relationships.
Lower Earnings Other researchers have em-
pirically documented similar earning and em-
ployment reductions for people with diabetes
and have often framed the reductions within a

human capital perspective.22 Diabetes could alter
a person's desire for and success in making per-
sonal investments in a career. Equally, it could
dilute an employer's willingness to invest in em-
ployees with diabetes if they were expected to
have more absences or lower productivity than
other employees.22 In either scenario, the em-
ployee with diabetes is presumed to have inferior
potential or productivity and is consequently
penalized in wages.
Alternatively, employment-sponsored health
insurance might play one or more roles in this
context. For people diagnosed with diabetes dur-
ing their working years, the "job lock" phenome-
non--in which workers fear losing health insur-
ance if they seek better-paying jobs--might be
partly responsible for their lower earnings.28 In
addition, obesity has been shown to independ-
ently lower a person's earnings when an em-
ployer attempts to offset expected future in-
creases in the cost of medical care pertaining
to obese employees.10 Considering the high
medical spending for people with diabetes, em-
ployers might engage in similar behavior specifi-
cally for this group.
Although the results shown in Exhibit 4 can-
not disentangle these respective influences, we
did find that the effects on work absences and
earningswereprimarily concentratedamongthe
privately insured. This suggests that at least a
portion of the medical and productivity-related
costs of diabetes are passed down to the em-
ployee through lower wages. However, we can-
not rule out possible contributions from "job
lock" and unobserved employment characteris-
tics, such as having a sedentary job.
Lower Education Poor health might play a
decisive role in lower educational attainment,
which in turn might influence a person's eco-
nomic circumstances in adulthood.36 For exam-
ple, the impact of diabetes on a young person's
health might lower the financial returns on edu-
cational investments or simply make learning
more of a struggle. In any case, the negative
effect of diabetes on educational attainment
could compromise success in the labor market.
For instance, high school and college graduates
earn 1.5 and 2.7 times more than high school
dropouts, respectively.34
Intergenerational Effects The negative
consequences of having a parent with diabetes
are novel findings. Similar to their peers with
diabetes, people whose parents have the disease
experience reductions in education and employ-
ment outcomes. Although these results are in-
triguing and important, their underlying causes
are not immediately obvious. A possible explan-
ation is that diabetes in one generation confers a
lower genetic endowment on the next genera-
tion. Another possibility is that parents with dia-
betes might have fewer financial resources and
less time to spend on their children because they
are forced to devote so much money and time to
managing their disease. These hypotheses are
not mutually exclusive.
Notwithstanding the difficulties in empirically
disentangling these relationships, this should be
a focus of future work. More important, if the
intergenerational consequences are real and sus-
tained, prior estimates of the true costs of dia-
betes to society are too low.
Policy Implications Because the drivers and
consequences of diabetes are manifold, so too
are the policy prescriptions. A few policy consid-
erations emerge from our study.
First, greater emphasis should be placed on
the near-term effects of diabetes, as opposed
to the more publicized long-term consequences.
Prevention, especially for children, might take
on a renewed urgency for parents and other
stakeholders once they become aware of how
soon the effects of diabetes emerge and how
profound the impact is later in life.
Second, researchers should attempt to identify
and study children of parents with diabetes with
an eye toward isolating the potential economic
and educational spillover effects on the next gen-
eration. Given the unyielding rise of diabetes and
obesity among the population as a whole, the
potential of diabetes to strike in one generation
and then have negative effects on the next--aside
from any additional risk for the disease--is a
cause for alarm.
Experts in the diabetes field have voiced con-
cerns over the number of people with diabetes
who might be undiagnosed. This problem con-
stitutes an important concern for the school-age
population.3 In light of our results, a stronger
push for in-school screening efforts might be
warranted, especially if the impact of diabetes
on individual learning and performance begins
before the classic manifestations of clinical dia-
betes appear. Waiting until the onset of clinical
symptoms may be too late if we hope to mitigate
or reverse the negative impacts of the disease on
human capital and workplace success.
Conclusion
Estimates of the total annual costs of diabetes in
the United States range from tens of billions of
dollars two decades ago to $200 billion in recent
years.15,16,19­21 Other estimates are that obesity-
related medical spending is more than $100 bil-
lion dollars per year.12
Taken together, obesity and diabetes re-
present a severe burden on the US health care
sector as well as on the larger economy. How-

ever, these estimates mask the more subtle point
of how damaging diabetes can be in terms of
human capital and a person's earnings early in
life. The early effects on education and wages can
erode future health, which could leave people
with diabetes trapped in an unpleasant spiral.
As we have shown, diabetes delivers an in-
creasingly common health shock to American
adolescents and young adults, leading to lower
educational attainment and shrinking earnings
and chances of employment. A person with dia-
betes can conservatively expect to lose more than
$160,000 over his or her working life, compared
to a peerwithout the disease. Moreover, thelarge
effects on the high school dropout rate could
translate into an additional $10 billion in societal
costs in this cohort of young adults.

are known to be more likely to be

ABOUT THE AUTHORS: JASON M. FLETCHER & MICHAEL R. RICHARDS
Jason M. Fletcher
is an associate
professor at the
Yale School of
Public Health.
In this month's Health Affairs,
Jason Fletcher and Michael
Richards mined a large school-
based survey--the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health--to calculate the short- and
long-term economic consequences
of diabetes when diagnosed in
teenagers and young adults. What
they found was sobering: Compared
to people without diabetes,
patients by age thirty were
10 percent less likely to be
employed, earned an average of
$6,000 less per year, and were
more likely to have dropped out of
school. In addition, the authors
found that for young adults with
diabetes, having a parent with
diabetes also leads to poorer
outcomes than when parents do
not have the disease.
"You can imagine that over time,
this disease doesn't go away, and it
chips away at opportunities," says
Fletcher, an associate professor in
the Division of Health Policy and
Administration at the Yale School
of Public Health. "The effects just
accumulate over time."
Fletcher, who has performed a
similar analysis of children
diagnosed with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, focuses his
research on the effects of peers and
social networks on health as well
as the impacts of poor childhood
health on adult outcomes. His
research has appeared previously in
Health Affairs as well as in the
Journal of Health Economics, Journal
of Human Resources, British Medical
Journal, and Demography. He has
received the Victor F. Fuchs Award
in Health Economics, sponsored by
RAND, and the Dorothy S. Thomas
Award from the Population
Association of America.
Fletcher received a doctorate in
applied economics from the
University of Wisconsin­Madison.
Michael R. Richards
is a graduate
student at the Yale
School of Public
Health.
Richards is pursuing a doctoral
degree in health economics from
the Division of Health Policy and
Administration, Yale School of
Public Health. His wide-ranging
research interests include the
composition of the physician labor
market, physician payment
structures, adverse medical events,
and malpractice. Some of his past
work has appeared in Health
Affairs, Medical Care, Medical Care
Research and Review, and Health
Care Management Review.
Richards holds a medical degree
and a master of public health
degree from the University of
Illinois at Chicago.
