Introduction
Recent decades have seen a notable rise in the numbers of
single parent households in developing countries. Latin
America, specifically, has seen a marked increase in the
number of homes headed by single female mothers, these
constituting more than a third of all households. This impacts
the lives of women who are already facing a limited job mar-
ket, reduced salaries, and the responsibility of single parent-
ing without family support, factors aggravated by a dramatic
rise in poverty levels (Comisión Económica para América
Latina y el Caribe [CEPAL], 2004; Gindling & Trejos, 2005;
Slon & Zúñiga, 2006). During the decades of the 1990s and
2000, the number of households headed by single female
parents increased, in Latin America, from 10% to 12%. This
growing tendency in recent years is principally due to the
rising number of separated and divorced couples (Arriagada,
2007; Rico & Maldonado, 2011; Rodríguez, 2004), which
contributes to greater vulnerability, mainly in the Caribbean
region (CEPAL, 2013).
In the past decade, in Colombia, for example, the number
of households headed by single mothers was a very prevalent
factor in urban areas. This decade saw family organization and
structure undergo diverse changes, resulting from shifts in
female heads of households, whether unmarried, separated, or
widowed women. Likewise, research about households
headed by single mothers in other developing countries has
also revealed similarly sharp rises: from 11.3% to 15.5% in
Argentina, for example, 11.9% to 16.6% in Uruguay, 6.9% to
8.7% in Brazil, and 6.4% to 7.5% in Chile. This increase has
impacted not only the structure of the traditional family unit
but has also had a strong influence on the state of women in
the labor force where their presence has almost tripled, mak-
ing them not only the prime emotional but also economic
support of their children (Alarcón, 2013; CEPAL, 2010,
2012; Gammage, 2009). These statistics are alarming when
we take a global look at households. According to United
Nations Children's Fund (2007), toward the end of the
decade of the 1990s, around 20% of all households were
headed by single mothers. This compares to 24% as regards
Latin American households.

Single, Divorced, or Separated? Factors
That Impact the Lives of Women Who
Are Heads of Household in Lima, Peru
Beatriz Alvarado1 and Rosa del Carmen Vilchez2
Abstract
The rupture of a conjugal relationship has both a positive and negative impact on the lives of immediate family members.
Although for many women terminating marriage may signal freedom from an oppressive, even violent conjugal relationship,
it is undeniable that this separation also results in strong social pressure and discrimination in certain contexts, a situation
which limits the woman's freedom of action in and outside of the home. The purpose of this descriptive, phenomenological
study is to explore the experiences of 15 Peruvian, urban-based mothers, all of whom made the decision to exchange
marriage for single parenthood within the confines of a strong patriarchal system. The study follows the actions of the
women as they seek to overcome obstacles related to parenting and the management of their respective households. Three
emerging themes are identified in this study: (a) the development of the woman's relationship as wife and mother, (b) impact
of the separation/divorce on the maternal role, and (c) experiences in the single parent household. Implications for social
research studies and practice are discussed.

In the case of Peru, statistics show that in 2013, 26.5% of
the country's households were headed by women. Within this
group, the reports present a division based on the condition of
poverty. It was noted that in the group of homes not affected
by poverty, a greater proportion of women were heads of
household, specifically 28 out of every 100. In poor house-
holds, comparatively, 22 out of every 100 women were head
of household (Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática
[INEI], 2014a). This would suggest that in the past several
years, there has been an increase in both poor and non-poor
households headed by women. As regards education level,
INEI's report also shows a higher rate of illiteracy in single-
person households and in extended single parent households:
15.2% and 14.2%, respectively. On the contrary, and accord-
ing to the type of home they belong to, 42.6% of heads of
composite households, 29.7% of single-person households,
28.8% of nuclear households, and 25.8% of extended house-
holds had received higher education. These statistics corrobo-
rate the studies focusing on one of the main causes of
separation and divorce among couples, namely, when wives
have a higher education level and greater economic indepen-
dence than their spouses (Simonsson & Sandstrom, 2011).
With respect to marital status, INEI (2010) points out that
22.6% of male/female heads of single parent nuclear family
households and 17.4% of single parent extended family
households are single, with no previous spouse. Divorced
men/women heads of household predominate in single parent
nuclear family units (2.7%) and single parent extended family
units (2.4%).
However, the last two decades have seen a dramatic
increase in the number of women on the job. This rose from
58.4% in 2001 to 64.8% in 2012, also taking into consider-
ation that the gap between jobs traditionally held by males
versus females has narrowed (INEI, 2014b). Nevertheless,
these percentages tend to shift in cases of marital separation,
which find women most affected due to the great difficulty
they face trying to hold down a job while managing a house-
hold on their own. This problem ultimately results in a sub-
stantially higher number of single mother-headed households
coping with the threat of poverty. Encuesta Nacional de
Hogares's (ENAHO) reports indicate that 23.3% of nuclear
households headed by single mothers are at poverty level
versus 19.4% that are headed by men (ENAHO & INEI,
2008; INEI & Movimiento Manuela Ramos, 2010).
The statistics vary considerably when we look at the
entire region. According to CEPAL's analysis, female heads
of household are not necessarily at a lower income level than
male heads of household. That is to say, there is no system-
atic difference in poverty levels of households headed by
men or women. Some homes headed by women have less
probability of operating at poverty level (CEPAL, 2003,
2004). This group would correspond to an increasingly
greater number of economically independent young women
from the region who are single parents.
Notwithstanding this economic independence, a global,
gender-focused look at women reveals that they is still the
group that is hardest hit by marital dissolution. Even before
this separation, many women find themselves in a dependent
economic situation, with respect to their partners, due to
household and child-rearing duties either completely or par-
tially preventing them from being wage earners. Likewise,
its human capital gets hard hit in terms of greater access to
education and work opportunities. Faced with the option to
divorce or stay married, many women suffer through the for-
mer "because of the children," because to do the contrary
would result in having to divide their time between caring for
children, home, working part or full time, and, in many cases,
being the sole support of their family (Poortman, 2000;
Sorensen & Hill, 2004). Despite the serious emotional,
social, and financial dilemmas that face the women on which
this study focuses, their resilience demonstrates their strength
in coping with the realities of being single parents.
For these reasons, it is imperative to understand the social,
labor, and personal dynamic of households headed by single
mothers in a way which also provides us with insight into
their daily lives. There is a scarcity of studies that explore
these realities from this specific angle. The purpose of this
study is to explore the experiences of 15 Peruvian women
who as a result of separation or divorce became the emo-
tional, economic, and social mainstay of their children. This
multiplicity of roles also carried with it a series of obstacles
and limitations, as detailed in the study's interviews and
observations, further ahead.
A Look at Identity Theory From the
Standpoint of Symbolic Interactionism
Symbolic interactionism and identity theory provide the
framework for this study. We analyzed the experiences of 15
Peruvian women as heads of household. We use the term
identity in this study to mean the image that the participants
have of themselves, as separated or divorced mothers, pro-
fessionals, and heads of household, among other roles. This
self-image, whether positive or negative, is generated
through behavior that starts developing as they being their
conjugal separations, as well as society's reactions, to the
same transition. This involves, according to Burke (1980),
symbolic means as much for the individuals in question as
for the social group to which they belong. Individual behav-
ior will tend to adjust itself in accord with past and present
experiences, and also with that of the social group's expecta-
tions (Hollander & Howard, 2000). These individual and col-
lective experiences are strongly related to issues of power that
interactionists pay particular attention when it comes to
oppressive and abusive relationships. Thus, there is a signifi-
cant correlation between domestic conflicts and structural
components of power, socio-economic situation, societal pres-
sure, and the traditional patterns of beliefs that often influence
Alvarado and Vilchez 3
the individual's decision-making ability (Dennis & Martin,
2005; Scully, 1988). In this same scenario, Allen-Collinson
(2009) states that symbolic interactionism leads us to exam-
ine conflict relationships from the individuals' experiences,
and their struggles to make proper decisions when their sense
of self and the situation are perceived as uncertain.
The construction of the self and identities happen through
interactions with others; in his analysis on human interac-
tion, Charon (1992) argues that interactionism explains how
social agents negotiate and construct meaning in specific con-
texts and social interactions with significant others and the
group in general. It is also a context in which identities are
negotiated and influenced by conflicted relationships and sit-
uations (Lempert, 1994). In their study on identity construc-
tion and societal roles, Marks and MacDermid (1996) point
out that we cannot reference a single type of identity; indi-
viduals take on different roles and, for this reason, assume
multiple interacting and influential roles during their lives. If
these roles and identities are considered adequate for society,
they will be accepted and supported, if not, they will be
rejected. In this way, according to the roles they exert, indi-
viduals are affected both socially and personally. In the case
of single mothers who are also heads of household, societal
messages are generally not very encouraging. It is hoped that
women build a family consisting of paternal and maternal fig-
ures that play domestic and public roles. In this way, society
forms the self that in turn assumes roles that represent diverse
aspects of the social process (Turner, 1991). When women
abandon this role, their situation becomes doubly compli-
cated on many levels, principally the financial and social.
Through personal and social roles, identity theory signals
an important aspect to keep in mind, namely, agency. This
refers to the capacity of people to reach certain goals in spite
of changes in their environment. When an individual pos-
sesses a great capacity for agency, he or she can adapt and
overcome adverse situations. Social and cultural structures,
however, also exert a strong influence over the attainment of
an individual's goals (Tsushima & Burke, 1999). Thus,
within a culture as strongly patriarchal as the Peruvian, sin-
gle mothers that are heads of household encounter serious
cultural and social patterns that, in many cases, limit the
development of their goals.
Method
The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of
15 Peruvian woman who are single mothers, heads of house-
hold, and residents of Lima. Descriptive phenomenology
was used as the best approach for critical and rigorous analy-
sis of social groups. In accord with Streubert and Carpenter
(2003), phenomenology helps us explain the essence of
experiences and realities, and the meaning of specific phe-
nomena. Brink and Wood (1998) describe descriptive phe-
nomenology as a three-stage process: intuition, analysis, and
description; and those were the strategies used for this study.
Furthermore, participants were encouraged to provide con-
crete examples of their experiences to support their state-
ments. The criteria used for the selection of the participants
were that they be professional women that resided in Lima;
single, separated, or divorced; head of household; and have
minor children living at home.
We used structured interviews, each of which lasted more
than an hour. This form of interview helped us to produce
consistent data that was compared across the participants.
Our participants were selected using snowball sampling to
identify significant cases about our study topic.
The interviews were done in Spanish language and
recorded and transcribed for subsequent analysis (Strauss &
Corbin, 1990). They were carried out in participants' work-
places or homes. Following the initial demographic-based
questions, three emergent themes were explored: (a) devel-
opment of the spousal relationship and motherhood, (b)
impact of the separation/divorce on the maternal role, and (c)
experiences in the single parent home.
Analysis and Discussion
We analyzed the experiences of 15 Peruvian women, all resi-
dents of Peruvian urban centers, single mothers, and heads of
household, ranging in age from 26 to 61 years. All of the
participants have higher education and work outside the
home in the area of administration, education, and health
care. All were separated or divorced at the time of the inter-
views, which took place between March and June 2014. The
emerging themes that we opted to analyze, based on the
experiences related in the interviews, were (a) development
of the previous spousal relationship and motherhood, (b)
impact of the separation/divorce on the maternal role, and (c)
experiences in the single parent home.
Development of the Spousal Relationship and
Motherhood
For this theme, we decided to explore the beginning of the
relationship, initial conflicts, and development of the events
that led participants to end their conjugal relationship and
continue life as single women.
In terms of participants' views on what constitutes family
life, all concurred about the importance of bonds of affection
and mutual support. For the majority, traditional ideas of
family persist: mother, father, and children as a goal to attain.
Five of the 12 women interviewed maintain the traditional
notion of family: mother, father, and children. They define
family as "a united group" of members who work for a com-
mon ideal.
My parents raised me to believe that family is the most important
thing, so when I got married I thought it would be forever and
that the two of us would work together to raise our children.
(Francisca, 46)
4 SAGE Open
I always dreamed of one day having the perfect family: Mom,
Dad, and kids. For me this was always very important. (Naty, 42)
When we shift away from these ideals and explore the
way participants themselves were raised, the women describe
a strong patriarchy, with their father as the main provider and
decision maker and their mother as the caregiver. They also
relate situations involving their parents'separations, infideli-
ties, and existence of "parallel families," that is, of a father's
mistress and the children born from this extramarital union.
Two participants described cases of sexual abuse and inap-
propriate touching within the family. The participants whose
parents separated affirm that they did not have the "ideal"
family.
My family has always been dysfunctional; my Dad went after
any woman who crossed his path . . . (Juana, 61)
Mom was more intelligent and educated, but Dad was a bully,
and so the bully would win out . . . they didn't fight, but neither
did I see any love. (Ariadna, 47)
He (her former spouse) comes from the typical home where the
Mom is a submissive, but happy slave. (Ariadna, 47)
The strong patriarchal system within the nuclear family
represses, in the words of Denner and Guzman (2006), the
identities of the women, situating them within the context of
a dominant culture that leaves little space for their own
voices. Products, for the most part, of repressive homes, the
participants manifested two points to consider: five of them
indicated that they got married after finding out they were
pregnant, and nine indicated that this was their first sexual
experience and that they decided to live with their partners to
avoid shame and criticism of their social group. They also
indicated that the violent, hostile environment of their own
homes led them to make hasty decisions to escape these
realities.
I fell in love and believed, like everybody, in the fairy tale. Back
then I was blinded by love, eyes closed, no Mom to give me
advice, and for Dad, all men were bad, "Look at me," he'd say.
I married my first boyfriend, a mistake. That's why I let my own
daughter get to know more people. (Chio, 39)
I needed somebody by my side, so I wouldn't feel lonely,
because at 19 nobody thinks about getting married or having
kids or any of those things. In my case it was because we didn't
live with my Mom, we lived with some aunts, and we were
mistreated. My sister took off with her boyfriend and I got
married. (Naty, 42)
Following the participants from one family nucleus into
another, we saw that the stories did not vary much. The brief
romance lived gave way to long episodes of tense cohabita-
tion. The women comment that they opted to initially con-
tinue their conjugal relationship, justifying acts of violence
to preserve the paternal image for their children. The marital
break ensued when the justifications were no longer viable.
The continuity of abusive relationships at the hand of a dom-
inating male figure provokes, according to Gage (2005), an
increase in violent situations that impact the physical and
emotional stability of women and children. In spite of the
serious irresponsibility of their partners with respect to the
care and upbringing of their children, these women thought
that time would change the situation. The opposite, in fact,
happened.
The indifference displayed by the women's ex-partners is
markedly seen in the division of roles. All of the women indi-
cated that they spent more time than their partners on house-
work and child care, which interfered with work outside the
home and generated much conflict. Four of the women in this
study group were higher wage earners than their partners
while married. They indicate that their work was hard and that
they did not have sufficient spousal support in this sense. This
corroborates studies that refer to the "double day," that is to the
say, work performed by wives in and outside of the home, far
surpassing in hours that of the husband's workday. The impact
that this has on the wife's emotional and physical stability is
damaging (Floro, 1995; Strober & Weinberg, 1980).
The participants expressed their frustration, recalling their
expectations at the onset of the relationship, that their part-
ners would provide economic support. As professionals,
working outside the home, the participants did not depend
economically on their partners; however, the women express
that not only were they alone responsible for the care of the
children but also for the complete economic and day-to-day
management of the home.
I took care of the home and also worked. I had to ask him to
help, but it was a problem and just created more conflict.
(Ariadna, 47)
Share the housework? Nothing doing! I did everything, cared for
the house, worked outside the home. His function and role as a
father was minimal, and really bothered me. (Lucila, 47)
Making the decision to separate was a long process; the
women looked (in the words of one participant) for "justifi-
cation to stay with him." Performing exhausting household
tasks on top of submitting to acts of psychological violence,
from the subtlest to the most explicit forms, are constants in
the interviews.
Cases of severe physical violence against the women and
also their children were documented. There was also a case
of rape (that resulted in pregnancy) described by the wom-
an's spouse as a normal occurrence between a couple
(Bennice & Resick, 2003). The participants also related
cases of infidelity by their partners that, amid other conflicts,
sparked the decision to separate.
Psychological abuse and jealousy were at the root of the
worst conflicts for me. The insults and the jealousy, the fact that I
Alvarado and Vilchez 5
supposedly did "nothing for him," since I didn't iron his shirts or
wash his clothes. I asked myself why I kept on in a relationship if
he didn't respect me and was with other women. (Eli, 26)
He went looking for problems, I couldn't speak or think. He
didn't want me to talk or express a thought, because he "didn't
want noise." The aggressiveness was getting worse . . . Our
youngest was the result of rape. In the end, after many years, I
reported him to the authorities. (Chio, 39)
Raised, for the most part, in homes where their identities
and voice were strongly repressed, the participants had cho-
sen to live with men who continued the pattern violence that
had begun for them in childhood. This tendency echoes the
analysis concerning the exposure of children to acts of vio-
lence during their formative years, and the impact of these
experiences on their adult lives (Early Intervention
Foundation, 2014).
The Impact of Separation or Divorce on the
Woman, How It Affects Her Maternal Role, and
Its Impact on the Extended Family
After understanding the motives that led participants to end
their relationships, we went on to explore the impact that this
rupture had on their lives, as well as on their domestic and
public surroundings. One of the greatest concerns of the
women was on the effect that their conjugal separation would
have on the lives of their children. Six of them initially
decided to continue the relationship so as not to "shatter the
paternal image," but over time, the women noticed that the
children would be even more damaged if they did not bring
the relationship to an end. This feeling concurs with the find-
ings related to women's choices as to continuing or ending
problematic relationships for fear of leaving their children
without a father (Afifi, Davis, Denes, & Merrill, 2013).
I decided to seek a separation for my children. He tried to kill me
twice. He wanted to smother me with the pillow, wanted to
abuse me. My kids witnessed the abuse. At first I thought that
they needed a father, but after I realized that this wasn't so.
(Chio, 39)
My daughter took the separation well. My life was not easy with
him. She doesn't talk much but I feel that with the help of the
psychologist she is starting to understand. (Ariadna, 42)
My daughter is the one that asked me not to go back to her
father. (MariEsther, 39)
The replies to the question about their emotions following
the separation are almost all the same. All describe feeling
relieved. In spite of feeling afraid of how to go forward with
their lives, they feel freed from having to carry "one less bur-
den." Two of the participants expressed feeling guilty after
the separation. In this case, the women's immediate family
plays an important role not only in an emotional but also a
material sense.
I feel a sense of relief. I feel somewhat guilty as well, but I also
feel like a burden has been taken off of me. It's normal,
we women tend to always blame ourselves. In terms of work, I
feel less pressured than before, but my work is demanding.
(Ariadna, 47)
At first I felt frustrated. Now I feel calm because I have
the support of my mother. If it weren't for her, I'd be afraid.
(Chia, 34)
It's as though I'd shaken a gorilla off my back, I was lighter . . .
I've gotten my strength back, my spirit, my happiness, dreams,
and the time that I never seemed to have before. (Juana, 61)
The women indicate that their families and close friends
were an important factor at the moment of making the deci-
sion to end their relationship. At this moment, in accord with
Ciabattari (2007), the individuals' social capital is funda-
mental, as it will be in providing valuable support during the
difficult transitional stage.
As they started out on the path of single parenthood, the
participants spoke of confronting a group of obstacles that
were not new for them. As mentioned previously, even when
they lived with their partners, they considered themselves as
heads of household. During the interviews, we gave them a
list of factors as related to their new status: social, familial,
labor, economic, and emotional. All pointed out that their
major concern, before making the decision to separate, was
financial. Four participants indicated that they set about
organizing their finances first. They also carefully organized
their job schedule and then found assistance from family,
friends, or domestic workers to help care for the children.
I made my financial plans before the separation; I calculated
costs and then told myself, "Now I can go ahead and do it . . ."
(Ariadna, 47)
Financially it worked out better. I found work, I got the kids
better organized. He only gives me child support when he feels
like it. (Chio, 39)
My siblings help me out with my kids when I get home late or
when I need to travel. My friends and I help each other out
taking care of each other's daughters. I'm creating a network of
good friends. (Ariadna, 47)
After the separation I had to support myself. A friend found me
a job. I had a young girl that helped me out. And on days that I
didn't have anybody, I took my son to work. (Naty, 42)
In participants' descriptions, reference to the ex-partner's
economic support is either absent, very limited, or given
because of a court mandate. The participants, in general, also
refer to their partners' "long-distance fathering," in which no
6 SAGE Open
real effort is made to help with the care, education, or support
of the children. This reality is a factor behind the high level
of Latin American children that are growing up, according to
Ali, Cleland, and Shah (2003), without a father's presence in
their lives. This absence potentially impacts scholastic devel-
opment, family life, and the behavior of the child himself or
herself. While for the participants conjugal separation repre-
sented a "relief" and even an improvement in terms of their
professional lives, for the children the breakup was processed
in different ways: Some started to perform better at school,
whereas others grew sad, withdrawn, and began to act out.
My daughter has always been the top student at her school.
(Ariadna, 47)
My daughter was upset by Father's Day celebrations that
happened at her school, they made her sad. This also happened
at her birthday parties or Christmas celebrations when he wasn't
present. (MariEsther, 39)
I'm always encouraging them, and they've been diligent
students, they earn diplomas, first places. (Gabriela, 53)
I always get congratulated about my daughter, I admire her and
she's a success; my son copies his sister. (Eli, 26)
However, leaving child care in the hands of others has an
emotional cost which at times can result in the loss of partici-
pants' control over their children.
I sometimes feel that I'm losing control over them because I
don't see them, although we have created ground rules like
always letting each other know where we are. (Lucila, 47)
For the participants, getting organized at work following
the separation meant longer hours away from home due to the
need to work full time or take on tasks of greater responsibil-
ity. In this study, all of the women stated that they worked an
average of 8 to 12 hr per day that represents a great challenge
in terms of finding a balance between work and family.
After analyzing the impact of the separation on their lives
and immediate environment, we interviewed the participants
about their identities, a term which, for Uhlmann (2004),
refers to emotions, feeling, beliefs, and desires of social
agents, which are strongly influenced by sociocultural
contexts.
Their Experiences as Single Parents
The participants' decision to end their marriages indicates
their will to exit violent, abusive relationships and wish to
reconstruct their lives (Campbell, Woods, Chouaf, & Parker,
2000). In spite of having to assume the challenge of taking
on greater responsibilities in terms of work and household
management, these women are determined to seek out new
horizons for themselves and their children.
Listening as they describe themselves as within this pro-
cess of identity change (Burke, 1980; Marks & MacDermid,
1996), we hear them use an array of adjectives in reference to
themselves: persevering, organized, responsible, depressed,
among others.
I am very complex, and my personality has many facets, from
very shy to extroverted. I'm an amalgam of thoughts and feelings.
I'm not simple and I love not being simple. (Ariadna, 47)
I feel brave and I feel cowardly. I can be a crybaby. I don't dare
do certain things, but the things that happen to me push me
forward. (Mary, 59)
I'm resilient, and I've learned to get through very difficult
situations. I'm positive and I'm slow to react, but when I lose
my temper, watch out! (Juana, 61)
I am too hard working. I get up early, cook lunch, pack the kids'
lunch boxes, clean the house and then leave. I've always been
like this. (Gabriela, 53)
I'm stubborn and tenacious and don't give up easily. I always
fight for my objectives. I want to have my own home and my
practice. (Lucila, 47)
The redefinition of participants' identities following the
separations, show women who faced with adversity, have the
ability to recover, acquire new skills (Flach, 1997), and cope
with their new realities, seeking a sense of personal and col-
lective well-being. This sense of resilience was observed
over the course of our conversations with these women. They
admit to feeling tired, but they agree that despite the added
responsibilities, they feel "relieved and renewed."
In terms of social life, the time taken up by child care and
access to new work opportunities resulted, in the cases of six
participants, in women feeling as though their social lives
had been put on hold. They do note, however, that as their
children have grown up, they have had more freedom to
revisit their social circles. One interesting point raised during
the interviews was that of entering into a new romantic rela-
tionship. The replies, in general, show that all hope this hap-
pens, although not necessarily right away or in terms of
representing a long-term relationship.
The phrase "putting your life back together" is one I don't like,
because my life is an integral, not a broken one. I'd like to find
someone, but it's not the time yet. (Ariadna, 47)
Yes, I'd like to be with another person, but I see it as complicated.
It's a question of putting my mind to it. I've gone out with other
people, and the truth is that they seemed worse than my ex. They
were egocentric guys, only into themselves. Right now I'm
dating a guy who doesn't take anything seriously. (China, 34)
Yes, I'd like to meet someone new, but I don't want to make
another mistake. Time will tell. (Francisca, 46)
Alvarado and Vilchez 7
The search and wish for a new relationship was another
constant in the women's conversations, who described the
burden placed on them by a society that associates marital
breakup with failure. They talked about both men's and
women's stereotypes concerning "single women."
Married women are very jealous of divorcées, they think if we
approach their husbands, it's because we have ulterior motives.
(Lucila, 47)
First of all, society looks at you as though you've failed at
something. Men see you as alone and there's nobody to have sex
with you. I don't see it as a triumph to be married, but a failure
to divorce. I didn't feel they thought of me this way at work,
because they have only seen me alone there. (Ariadna, 47)
You know what happens when a man finds out you're a single
woman? They start hanging around you as if expecting
something. They think you're there for the taking. Sometimes
they're really disrespectful! (China, 34)
Since my separation I haven't gotten invited to any of their
parties, my kids either. They think that because you're separated
and you're smiling, they can treat you whatever way they want.
(Naty, 42)
In her study on the problems that face divorced women in
the professional sphere, Fausto-Sterling (1992) points out a
constant struggle for them to reconstruct themselves in a soci-
ety where people treat them in a way that departs from what is
socially established. By "ignoring looks and comments"
(China, 34; Chio, 39), these women are reacting against the
androcentric message of what is truly valid and permitted for a
woman: taking her place within the traditional family unit.
The participants are optimistic about their futures, which
ideally include a stable financial situation and the well-being
of daughters and sons, whom the women hope to see grow up
and live independent lives.
In the next 5 years I see myself going back to study and with my
own apartment. (Eli, 26)
I see myself as happy, with my daughter, financially well off. I
like thinking about the way I'll be from here to 5 years from
now, happy, peaceful, enjoying my achievements. (China, 34)
In 5 years, I see myself as involved with someone, but not living
under the same roof. I don't want to be wealthy; I want peace
and time for myself. (Chio, 39)
In 5 years I see myself not working for somebody else. I don't
want to depend on a schedule, I want a more low key existence.
I want my daughter to finish her degree, so that she won't be
stuck in some job that runs her ragged. (Lucila, 47)
Based on the experiences of their divorces, separations,
teenage pregnancy (in the case of Eli, 26), domestic violence,
and irresponsible partners, one of the participants' greatest
fears is that these patterns continue in the lives of their sons
and daughters. In their study dealing with the impact of
divorce on children, Cui, Fincham, and Durtschi (2010)
show that although there exists a high likelihood of divorce
in the lives of the children of divorced parents, it is not a total
given and their ultimate decision to dissolve their marriage
would depend on numerous factors. The mothers, in this
study, are more determined to invest time and dedication to
their own sons and daughters.
I'm afraid. My fear is that the same thing will happen to my
daughter. I have to help her so that my own story is not repeated.
(Lucila, 47)
The subjects of this study--mother that are separated,
divorced, professional, residents of urban centers of the capi-
tal city--ended their conjugal relationships and became sin-
gle heads of household with the determination that their
decision represented the wisest path for their own lives, and
that of their children.
Conclusions and Implications for
Practice
The interviews reveal that the participants' decisions to
become single parents have carried with them a heavy men-
tal and physical toll. The women, nevertheless, feel that their
status as professionals provides substantial leverage and
solidity in terms of their economic independence, despite the
longer workdays. To this is added the determination to termi-
nate situations of domestic conflict for the well-being of their
children. The women also reference a vision of a traditional
family unit where the ideal continues to be "Mom, Dad, and
the kids." This notion, for many of those interviewed, caused
them to prolong conjugal ties despite their partner's infidel-
ity, violence, and--in some cases--financial dependence.
The decision to become responsible heads of household,
not only sole caregivers but also providers, brought with it a
series of difficult challenges described by the subjects of this
study. The participants--products of patriarchal families
where their voices and identities were constantly suppressed
since childhood, in great part--continued this pattern after
beginning their own relationship and forming families. In
spite of this, when faced with their partner's irresponsibility
and domestic abuse, the women made the decision to recon-
struct their lives through new identities and the redefinition
of concepts about what it means to be separated or divorced
in a powerfully androcentric society.
The goal of this study was to explore the experiences of
15 women, residents of Peru's urban centers, in terms of their
decision to become single heads of household within a solid
patriarchal system. No study, to date, has researched and pre-
sented this theme through women's direct testimony. We feel
that this investigation will represent a valuable contribution
8 SAGE Open
for future studies. It is also important to explore the conse-
quences of single motherhood on women's physical and
mental health. The subject of depression and illness prior to,
and following, conjugal separations should be analyzed
through a phenomenological focus, in which experiences and
direct testimony play a vital role.
