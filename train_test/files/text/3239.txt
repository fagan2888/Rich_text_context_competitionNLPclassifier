Summary
Electronic money constitutes (for the time being) the most recent innovation in payment
instruments. The extent to which the further spread of electronic money might have
consequences for monetary policy depends not least on the actual demand for electronic
money. Numerous studies have sought to answer this question. However, those studies deal
for the most part with the expected spread of electronic money in over-the-counter (OTC)
transactions. As far as further developments in network money are concemed, though, it
has not been possible to gain anywhere near as much in the way of insights. This is
particularly amazing since from a monetary policy perspective network money, in
particular, threatens the central bank's monopoly on money creation.
Against this background, this paper attempts to shed more light on the future spread of
network money. It departs from the question as to the possible use of network money for
transaction purposes. To answer this question, the paper studies a simple model which
incorporates the demand for different payment media as weH as their supply. In earlier
studies, the influence of the supply side has in many cases only been partially included.
On balance, the study shows that cyber money will most likely not completely substitute
other forms of money. Rather, a specialisation of different payment media for different
transaction values is probable. Specialisation here means that only one payment medium is
employed to buy a good. Here, analogously to the use of electronic money in OTC trade,
network money is likely to assume the role of a medium of exchange used for small-value
transactions.

Elektronisches Geld stellt die (vorerst) neueste Innovation im Bereich des
Zahlungsverkehrs dar. Inwieweit sich aus seiner Verbreitung Konsequenzen fllr die
Geldpolitik ergeben, hängt nicht zuletzt davon ab, in welchem Umfang elektronisches Geld
vom Publikum tatsächlich zu Zahlungszwecken eingesetzt werden wird. Zur Beantwortung
dieser Frage liegt mittlerweile eine Reihe von Arbeiten vor. Die weit überwiegende Anzahl
sowohl der empirischen als auch der theoretischen Untersuchungen bezieht sich jedoch auf
den Einsatz elektronischen Geldes im stationiren Handel. Weniger intensiv wurden bislang
Fragen des Netzgeldes untersucht. Dies ist um so erstaunlicher, als aus geldpolitischer
Sicht insbesondere Netzgeld das Geldschöpfungsmonopol der Notenbanken bedroht.
Vor diesem Hintergrund soll mit der vorliegenden Arbeit der Versuch unternommen
werden, die voraussichtliche weitere Entwicklung des Netzgeldes näher zu beleuchten.
Ansatzpunkt ist dabei die Frage nach seiner möglichen Verwendung zu
Transaktionszwecken. Diese wird im Rahmen eines einfachen Modells untersucht, das
sowohl die Nachfrage nach Zahlungsverkehrsdienstleistungen als auch ihr Angebot
einbezieht, dessen Einfluß in der bisherigen Literatur oft nur partiell berücksichtigt wurde.
hn Ergebnis zeigt sich, daß Netzgeld andeJ:e Geldformen wahrscheinlich nicht vollständig
verdrängen wird. Vielmehr dllrfte sich eine Spezialisierung unterschiedlicher
Zahlungsverkehrsmittel fllr bestimmte Preisbereiche ergeben. Unter dem Begriff der
Spezialisierung ist dabei die Tatsache zu verstehen, daß fllr den Kauf eines Gutes nur ein
Zahlungsverkehrsmittel eingesetzt wird. Dabei dllrfte dem Netzgeld analog zum Einsatz
elektronischen Geldes im stationären Handel die Rolle eines Zahlungsmittels im Bereich
der Kleinbetragszahlungen zukommen.

I. Introduction
The history of money has been characterised by evolution towards more efficient forms of
money in terms of (transaction) costs. Electronic money (e-money) is so far the latest
innovation. Up to now this new type of money has not made very deep inroads into
Germany. At the end of 1998, there were 52 million Geldkarten, onto which electronic
money can be stored, in the hands of the public. However, it must be borne in mind that the
vast majority of those cards are eurocheque cards that have additionally been outfitted with
a Geldkarte function. At the same time the value loaded onto all cards totalled merely
DM 113 million. By contrast, the amount of cash in circulation excluding credit
institutions' cash balances was slightly more than DM 242 billion at the end of last year. At
that same time, software-based electronic money on the Internet issued in Germany,
though, had not left the pilot project phase.
However, it would appear premature for monetary policy makers to conclude that there is
no need to take action. In areport published last year, the European Central Bank: tackled
the issue of the possible consequences which the further spread of electronic money might
have for monetary policy.l The extent to which they actually will appear depends not least
on the extent of actual demand for electronic money. Numerous studies have sought to
answer this question. However, those studies deal for the most part with the expected
spread of electronic money in over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Regarding further
developments in network money which can be used on the Internet, though, it has not been
possible to gain anywhere near as much in the way of insights.

This is particularly amazing since the question as to what role this fonn of money will play
in the future has been answered nearly euphorically by followers of certain economic
schools of thought. Those particularly deserving of mention here are proponents of
increased competition in the monetary sector, known as the "free banking" schoo1.2 1bey
especially hope that electronic money on the Internet will become a medium of exchange
that can be brought into circulation independently of the prevailing central bank monopoly
and that will exhibit desirable quality features in the sense of a stable and efficient
monetary system. Titles li.ke "'Ibe Internet and the End of Monetary Sovereignty" serve to
show where the expected evolution will end.3
But even if no completely independent f10ws of money are generated with the help of
network money. its widespread circulation is capable of having a considerable impact on
monetary policy. 1be debate on what is called "New Monetary Economics" has recently
been stimulated by the technical possibilities of innovations in payment systems.4 Based on
the assumption of a largely deregulated monetary sector, followers of this school of thought
believe there will be a separation of different functions of money: in this system of
separated monetary functions, transactions will be settled by marketable assets of variable
value. In that scenario central bank money may take on the role of a unit of account, if at
all.s
Against this background, this paper attempts to shed more light on the future spread of
network money. It departs from the question as to the possible use of network money for
transaction purposes.
This paper is structured as folIows: Section n starts with a definition of the concept of
network money followed by abrief description of the payment system on the Internet. The
special features described in this section have an impact on the method of analysis. In

Hayek (1977). See Pool (1998) for a critique of Hayek's proposal and for the empirical assessment for

particular, an empirical approach seems to have little chance of success at present.
Therefore, the microeconomic explanation of the use of various payment instruments forms
the centrepiece of this paper. Section III discusses, on the basis of Whitesell (1992), a
theoretical explanation of the transaction-related demand for different media of exchange
on the Internet. Section IV, the key chapter ofthis paper, extends the framework of Section
III and analyses the interaction between the supply of and demand for cyber money. The
resulting equilibrium will provide a tentative assessment of a plausible scenario for the
spread of network money. Section V concludes.
11. Special features of network money
1. Definition
"Electronic money is broadly defined as an electronic store of monetary value on a
technical device that may be widely used for making payments to undertakings other than
the issuer without necessarily involving bank accounts in the transaction, but acting as a
prepaid bearer instrument."6
Therefore, if the stored units of value can only be used to pay for certain goods or services
and if the issuer and the acceptor are identical (single purpose schemes), this is not
considered electronic money. Prepaid telephone cards are one example. A further
distinction should be made between electronic money and products that provide electronic
access to standard forms of money such as sight deposits. In this area, the use of
eurocheque cards employed as debit cards has become particularly widespread in
Germany.7
In the actual area of e-money, two different product forms have crystallised so far. One is
prepaid cards. In this context the EeB uses the term "card-based products" and defines
them as "(...) plastic card[s] which contain[s] real purchasing power, for which the
6 European Central Bank (1998), p. 6.
7 Eurocheque cards can be employed as debit cards for EFfPOS payments (either with a PIN number in an
electronic cash procedure or in the POZ method, i. e. point of sale without payment guarantee). Por
information on developments in these forms of payment in Germany see Deutsche Bundesbank (1997) and
(1999).

customer has paid in advance (...)."81be other type is "software-based products" which
serve typically to transfer electronically stored value units via telecommunications
networks such as the Internet.
Tbe term "network money" should not be regarded as synonymous with a certain type of
electronic money product. Although it contains software-based products, card-based
products must also be included insofar as they are also employed in telecommunicatioDS
networks with the help ofcard readers to make payments.9
2. Tbe payment system in different marketplaces
Tbe use of network money as a payment instrument in (Internet) trade will also depend on
what alternative payment instruments are available. This raises the question of the payment
system on the Internet. For the sake of comparison, the payment system for OTC trade will
be briefly outlined first, without going into further detail on the individual payment
instruments.
2.1. The payment system for OTC trade
Payment instruments are usually classified according to the onset of the liquidity effect,
from the point of view of the payer, i. e. the purchaser of a good or service. Tbe "liquidity
effect" is defined in this context as an interest waiver, since it is no longer possible to
invest the funds in an interest-bearing way. To that extent, classifying different payment
instruments reflects an important component of the transaction costs which accrue to the
payer: in the event of liquidity effect prior to receipt of the good, the buyer incurs
opportunity costs in the form of lost interest income. If the good is paid for after receipt,
the cost calculation should take interest gains into account. In this sense, for instance, cash
is a payment instrument which is categorised as "pay before". From the moment cash is
8 European Central Bank (1998), ibid.
9 Rojas (1996) makes a distinction in this context between off-Une money (- card-based network money) and
on-line money (- software-based networlc money). These terms, though, do not seem particularly weU-chosen
as they might lead to confusion in connection with the terminology of the OTC payment system. It is true that
the term off-line transaction is used here. too. in connection with card-based e1ectronic money. However. this
term's counterpart referring to the on-lioe authorisation nccessary to use adebit card does not describe an
alternative form ofelectronic money but is an access product instead.

withdrawn, i. e. even before the time of the actual purchase, its holder relinquishes the
opportunity of collecting interest.
By contrast, in the case of a prepaid instrument of payment, its issuers have what is known
as the "float" at their disposal. The use of a payment instrument where the liquidity effect
sets in after transfer ofthe good involves a deferral of payment or a credit to the buyer.
For OTC trade the following description of the main payment instruments can be
derived:10

- prepaid cards
Point in time when a good is
transferred
paynow:
- debitcard
- bank transfer
- direct debit
- cheque
Deterrall credit
... t
payJater:
- charge card I credit card
The categories "pay before", "pay now" and "pay later" each contain different payment
instruments the buyers have at their disposal. The classification of the various payment
instruments shown in Chart 1, however, is merely a rough orientation. By no means should
one conclude that payment instruments belonging to the same category will all take
liquidity effect at the exact same time for the person making a payment. For example,
owing to the required processing time, the liquidity effect of a eurocheque will probably be
different from that of a payment by debit card authorised on-line. The same applies to the
different liquidity effects of charge cards (where the payment is deferred until the amount
is debited, usually monthly - with no credit option) and credit cards, provided the credit
option is utilised. Nevertheless, the above classification illustrates the general nature of
each payment instrument.

2.2 The payment system on the Internet
Existing payment instruments are used to settle some of the payment transactions executed
via the Internet This is only establishing access using a new medium. Moreover, there are
in some cases already electronic equivalents of the payment instruments shown in Chart 1;
for some of them their (technical) implementation is just a matter of time.11 Fmally, there
are also payment instruments specially devised for the Internet Analogously to the chart
for OTC trade. the payment system on the Internet can be roughly outlined as folIows:12

When applying the standard classification of payment instruments to the Internet
environment, a limiting factor must be noted: owing to the medium involved here, the
intervals between the liquidity effects of different categories are often shortened
considerably. This is less so in the area of pay later instruments, which only establish
access via the Internet without changing the settlement periods of the issuer. By contrast,
the time interval between the liquidity effects of payment instruments belonging to the
other two categories is likely to decrease. However, the specified classification still
maintains a certain justification in that it highlights the key features of the payment
11 Tbe payment system on the Internet will only be briefty sketched in this report. For a more detailed
description see, for instance, Furche and Wrightson (1997), Schuster, Firber and Eberl (1997), S10lpmann
(1997) or Weißhuhn (1998). In particular, the aforementioned literature contains exp1anations of the security
strategies associated with each payment instrument
12 Here. it should be noted that not all on-line purchases ofgoods or services are paid for within this medium.
Actually. goods ordered over tbe Internet in Germany are paid for largely by invoicing or C.O.D. (Voss

instruments being considered here. They, in turn, influence the costs associated with the
payment instrument, which will be at the centre of the foHowing theoretical analysis.
The payment systems environment on the Internet deviates from that of over-the-counter
trade in that there is no anonymous, fmal, cash·like payment instrument which serves as an
alternative to e-money. Pay before instruments are only available in the form of network
money. This type ofmoney can be employed two ways:
Firstly, software-based systems have been tested in pilot projects for quite some time
already (in Germany since 1997).13 At the centre of the system whose features are
probably most similar to those of cash is what is called an electronic purse, which is
instalied on the PC of the payer supported by a special type of software. It can be
used to store electronic value units (tokens) for later use, which are loaded by the
customer and certified by the issuing bank. The anonymity of the payment transaction
is guaranteed by encryption methods which make it possible for the issuer to verify
the authenticity of a token submitted by a third party without the identity of the
consumer being revealed at the same time.l4 In addition, a further Internet payment
system is being tested in Germany at present; however, it does not involve electronic
money as defined by the ECB. For the consumer, though, it is similar to electronic
money in terms of the need for special software as weH as its use (electronic purse).
This system centres on shadow accounts, "cash containers", held both by the payer
and the traders receiving the payments. However, they are held not on the PC at
home but centrally by the issuer.ls Hence, this is not a bearer instrument.
Secondly, there are card-based systems which allow electronic money saved on
prepaid cards to be sent on the Internet with the help of a reading instrument linked to
the consumer's PC.
13 For the German pilot project see Blakowski, G, C. Blum and C.A. Gerlof (1997). 

14 On the method ofblind signature used in this context see Chaum (1997). On further details ofthe system, 

see DigiCash (1998). 

IS See CyherCash (1999). 

-7
From today's perspective it is unclear whether one of the two types of e-money products
will eventually prevail on the Internet and which ODe will do so. The card-based variant is
supported, in particular, by the fact that it can also be used in OTC trade.16 By contrast, the
security technology presently available seems to favour the software-based type of network
money.17
In the category of Internet payments that take place simultaneously with the transfer of the
good, there are basically several electroDic types ofconventional payment instruments: they
include not only the electronic (collection-only) cheque procedurel8, but also electroDic
direct debiting. However. the aforementioned systems are at different stages of
development. Moreover. they are not available to all Internet purchasers - depending on
the regulatory stance regarding contracts signed electroDically. The problem these payment
instruments generally share is the legally binding nature ofelectronic signatures. To use the
procedures belonging to this group, generally both sides of the market need a special
software with which the payment is automatically executed. The security of the instruments
described depends on whatever encryption methods are used when transmitting the data.
As regards the pay later methods of payment on the Internet, in addition to the unsecure
exchange of information necessary for payment transactions (such as credit card numbers)
between the purchaser and the trader, there are mainly two basic models of a secure
system:
Firstly, there are systems where the data required for the transaction are encrypted
before being sent. A special software installed on the participating computers is used
for encryption.l9
16 See. for example. Pauli and Koponen (1997). p. 12; von Radetzky (1998). p.59; and Rodewald (1998),
p.22. 

17 Rojas (1996), p. 239. 

18 See. for example. Netcheque (1999). 

19 The development of SET (Secure Electronic Transaction) could set an open standard for the encrypted 

transmission of confidential information through open nctwodcs. It is true that this standard is suited 10 the
secure transmission of information. very gencrally speakina. How.:ver, since this communication standard
was developed at the urging of credit card companies. it is especially likely 10 be used for credit card
transactions on the InterneL See. tor instance, Judt, Bödenauer and Andlinger (1998), p. 774. However, it
must be noted that SET by no means represents a complete paymeot system. See. for instance. Stolpmann
-8
The second model is a debiting system linked to different types of assets 
analogous to the charge card principle. These are payment instruments where the
operator has a binding contractual relationship with both consumers and traders. The
trader receives payment from the operator of the system and the consumer receives a
bulk invoice at regular intervals. Payment can then be made either by credit card or
by directly debiting the amount from a sight-deposit account. If the payment is linked
to a credit card, the settlement described here can be regarded as a secure procedure
insofar as there is no need to pass on confidential card information over the Internet
for individual transactions. Rather, this information only has to be transmitted once,
such as in the application sent to the system operator along secure communication
channels, i. e. by phone or maiI. Besides being used for payments in closed systems,
such as, and in particular, shopping malls, this method of making payments secure
can be used in general for credit card transactions on the Internet, too.10
3. The analytic approach
Recent studies have tackled the issue of what consequences electronic money will entail for
monetary policy. The vast majority of both the empirical and the theoretical studies,
however, refer implicitlY or explicitly to the use of electronic money in the form of prepaid
cards for over-the-counter trade, whereas up to now the issue of network money has not
been studied as intensively.
Most studies focus on the role that electronic money is likely to playas a payment
instrument in the future. 'Ibis approach will be followed here, too. As opposed to network
money, though, the use of e-money in over-the-counter trade is foreseeable, not least
because there is already experience with systems introduced on the market. There is not
much dispute conceming the fact that primarily cash will be substituted as a payment
(1997), p. 74. Instead, the SET protocol is to be integrated into the payment system software, which is then 

accessed during the payment transaction by the parties involved. 

10 See, for instance, First Virtual (1999).

instrument for low-priced goods, even if there is less agreement about the expected extent
of the substitution process and its importance to monetary policy.21 22
By contrast, from today's perspective, the empirical evidence of the actual use of network
money, such as for low-value payments. is insufficient As mentioned earlier, the use of
network money issued in Gennany is still in the pilot project stage. To that extent,
therefore, one cannot rule out the possibility that in future nearly the entire spectrum of
Internet transactions will be paid with network money.
Furthermore, the payment system in which network money is taking up position is different
from that of over-the-counter trade in tbat there is not necessarily a satisfactory solution
applicable to all transactions, particularly to trade in low-priced goods. For example, there
is no fmal payment medium that is comparable with cash. In that case, network money,
however, would not just be a substitute but also a complement within the payment system
once a new market is opened up by network money. In addition, a further dynamic
development of trade on the Internet is expected, which means we would be ill-advised to
base our analysis on the existing volume of transactions. Thus, the scope of a discussion
dealing solely with the substitution of existing payment instruments by e-money would
inevitably be too limited.
Therefore, a more fundamental approach has been chosen here: against the background of
the theoretical discussion conceming the demand for and the supply of different Media of
II See, for instance, Alejano and Peüalosa (1998) for calculations of the cash substitution to be expected in
Spain. Boeschoten and Hebbink (1996) cak:ulafe tbe expected spread ofelecb'Onic money in over-the-counter
trade in the G-IO countries. See also JaDSSOD and Lange (1998) for similar calcu1ations for Gennany.
The aforementioned calculations an: based, inter alia. on assumptions conceming the processes of
substitution to be expected between prepaid cards a:nd established payment instruments. particularly cash. If it
may be assumed that electronic money in OTC trade will be in a well-defined ratio to the cash substituted,
then the contraction of the demand for cash can be calculated based on a plausible average amount of e
money per prepaid card. For example, given an equal velocity ofcirculation ofelectronic money and cash. the
former would substitute the latter to the same extent. However. the velocity ofcirculation ofelecb'Onic money
is likely to be bigher than that of traditional forms ofmoney. See Ruckriegel and Seitz (1999), p. 233. As an
alternative. assumptions on the probable replacement ofcertain denominations ofcash or a careful analysis of
the frequency of certain payment amounts may serve as a basis for benchmark scenarios regarding the
substitution ofcash.
22 See. for instance. Bank for International SeUlemeDlS (1996). Berentsen (1998). European Central Bank
(1998) or Söllner and Wilfert (1996) for an overview of possible monetary policy consequences of
widespread cash substitution byelecb'Onic money.
-10
exchange, the objective of this study is to ascertain which role network money can play in
payments on the Internet of non-banks in future. Other authors take a similar approach by
using microeconomic models grounded in the transactions motive of holding money as a
basis for gaining further insights into the spread of electronic money to be expected. The
two groundbreaking papers on this subject were written by Whitesell (1992) and
Santomero and Seater (1996). The latter paper, though, analyses only the demand for
various payment media. Based on an extension of Whitesell (1992), Folkertsma and
Hebbink (1998) examine the behaviour of purchasers of a good or service when choosing
which payment instrument to use as weIl as the consequences for the use of electronic
money. Shy and Tarkka (1998), by contrast, study a model which takes into account the
decision-making problems of all parties involved, including purchasers, issuers of prepaid
cards and traders. The aforementioned papers, though, are all restricted to an analysis of
payments in OTC trade. By contrast, Prinz (1999) explicitly studies the potential spread of
network money by applying a Lancaster approach to the problem faced by the purchaser of
a good or service in trying to decide which payment medium to use.
The model introduced in Section IV differs from the cited literature insofar as it, for one
thing, explicitly tackles the problem of the future spread of electronic money on the
Internet. For another, the analysis is not limited to the payer's decision between different
payment media. Rather, the behaviour of payment services providers is also included.
III. Whitesell's model or the demand ror different payment media
Only recently has the issue of using different forms of money for transaction purposes been
studied more closely from a theoretical perspective. In addition to the inventory theoretic
approach by Santomero and Seater (1996), which is based on Baumol (1952) and Tobin
(1956), the model developed by Whitesell (1992) provides a theoretically substantiated
explanation of the demand for different payment media.
One characteristic of Whitesell's model compared to that of Santomero and Seater is a
more differentiated cost structure. To that extent it can be understood as a formalisation of
the widespread assertion to be found in the literature on e-money that the costs entailed by
cyber money are likely to have a decisive influence on its future. There are now aseries of
-11
papers that analyse the costs and benefits of network money to those involved.13 Another
thing is that the underlying cash-in-advance condition as a determinant of money demand,
which results in the individual decision-making problem being, relatively speaking, less
complex than in the inventory theoretic approach, implies a clearer relationship between
the costs and the use of the various payment media. Therefore, in the following the
WhiteseIl model will fonn the basis for taking a closer look at the demand for different
payment media on the Internet.
The framework of Whitesell's model is as follows:
· The individual's problem consists only in minimising the costs of predetennined
purchases of goods. The individual receives a fixed income which is distributed evenly
(Y for each value of transactions) across the range of goods, i.e. the same amount is
spent on each type of good. The goods are distinguishable by their different prices (Pi ).
Instead of looking at different transaction volumes, the approach looks at varying
transaction frequencies n,. These are an inverse function of the transaction values: the
higher the price of a given good, the less frequently it will be bought during the one
period considered here.
· One period is being observed here. At the beginning of the period, similarly to other
cash-in-advance models, the decision on assets has to be taken. The transactions are
settled at the end of the period.14
· The original model examines three different payment media - cash, cheques and credit
cards in OTC trade - specifying the costs they each entail. Basically a similar approach
is possible for Internet trade and will be used in this section for the optimisation
problem faced by the purchaser of a good or service. Thus, electronic cheque
23 On the cost-benefit structure of e-mooey and its significance, see, for instance, BOschgen (I998b),
Dickertmann and Feucht (1997) or Hmeiner (1997).
14 As opposed to an inventory tbeoretic approach, in the Whitesell m<XIel transaction costs are minimised not
by determining the withdrawals during the period but only by choosing the Media of exchange once at the
beginning of the period. Folkertsma and Hebbink (1998), however, have shown that incorporating the
inventory approach into Whitesell's modeJ is bolb possibJe and worthwbile. However, it does not alter the
basic structure of the tindings.

procedures, payment (in a secure or encrypted way) by credit card and cyber money will
be examined here.2S
Following Whitesell, the costs to the purchaser which each medium of exchange entails are
specified as follows:

Here /3; designates the fixed costs per transaction. Those of a credit card payment are
normalised at unity; for those of a payment by cheque the following shall hold: 0< Ps < 1 .
In addition to transaction fees charged by the issuer of a payment medium, this cost
component may also include the time required for a transaction using that particular
payment medium. It could be argued here that the use of network money may be less time
consuming compared with the other payment media because the money has already been
authorised prior to the purchase. In software-based systems there are tokens on the hard
drive of the customer's horne computer, whereas in card-based systems there is value
stored on prepaid cards. It can only be estimated with difficulty to what extent this
argument actually brings its weight to bear, in terms of network money transactions
requiring less time, and it depends on future technological developments. For example, as
part of the software-based e-money system currently being tested in Germany, merchants
consult the network money issuer to settle each transaction, which means that at present the
time required by each of the three payment media is likely to differ only fractionally.
Anyway, on account of the speed of electronic communications, there will probably be no
major differences, either. For simplicity, let us assurne here that this cost component will
not playa role.
That leaves a potential fee charged by the issuer for each transaction as the determinant of
fixed costs entailed by paying with network money. It is certainly possible, given the
2S See Section 1I.2.2 of this paper.
-13
software-based systems existing today, to levy such a fee due to the participation of the
issuer in the transactions.16 However, the More it becomes possible in the future to transfer
e-money from customer to customer without involving a centraI body, the less possible it
will be to levy a fee. In other words, the MOre closely future network money systems
resemble cash. the MOre apt it would seem to set up a model incorporating costs to the
purchaser of using network money which do not contain a fixed cost component In the
following, therefore, we will assume the fixed costs of a network money transaction, PE' to
be zero. This assumption has no severe impact insofar as the results compared to the
original Whitesell model are uncbanged as long as the fixed costs of a network money
transaction are lower than those of all other payment media, which is still the case.
However, for network money account will be taken of the fact that as the amount of money
transacted rises, so do the risks involved. This is justified insofar as payment using cyber
money as a bearer instrument is the only form of payment where purchasing power is
transmitted via the Internet The same risks of loss, theft and counterfeiting that apply to
cash also apply to network money, in principle. The model parameter k represents these
risks in proportion to the transaction volume.17
Whitesell's assumptions with respect to the opportunity costs entailed by each form of
payment, are motivated not only by their varying liquidity effect but also and in particular
by their linkage to different assets. Whereas cheques can be cashed on deposits, credit card
purchases can be settled through (money market) fund shares. As already shown in section
II.2, however, the non-coincidence of the liquidity effect of the payment media can also be
regarded as an important determinant of the opportunity costs. This has consequences for
the possible constellation of the model parameters. Ifone focuses on the different links, the
return on the balances held for cheque payments and for credit card payments are the same
26 With one exeeption. the electronie money systems available at present do not permit purse-to-purse
payments. Le. unlimited payments between individuals. This is true of most card-based systems. The same
holds for the software-based system described in Section n.2.2 wbere the tokens are returned to the issuer
after being used once.
27 It is true that sueh risks also exist for other payment media. such as credit cants. UDlike network money,
whieh is a bearer instrument, tbeft of tbe credit card number does not automatieally lead to the loss of real
purehasing power. In the example cited here tbe owner of tbe eredit card has the option of blocking the eard.
The key assumption concerning the model results is not so much that payment instruments on the Internet are
risk-free. with the exception of network money. Ratber, tbe decisive factor is that tbe risks of loss, theft and
eounterfeiting are the highest, relatively speaking, for eyber money.
-14
if the interest earned on the underlying assets is the same. By contrast, focusing on the non
coincidental settlement of the payments will lead to the opportunity costs of paying by
cheque being able to correspond to those of payment by credit card only if deposits bear a
higher rate of interest than the asset used to settle a credit card payment. 1f, however - as
is customary in Germany - both payment media are usually linked to deposits, this
possibility does not apply. By contrast, it is technically quite possible to offset network
money's liquidity effect preceding that of payment by cheque by allowing the stored value
to bear interest, since Ws lead time - as opposed to a comparison between a cheque and a
credit card - does not go hand in hand with transferring the assets to the seIler of a good
or service. Pay before payment media, rather, remain in the hands of the purchaser up to the
point in time of the transaction, Le. until the point in time of the liquidity effect of the pay
now instruments. The model parameter r designates either solely the interest borne by the
asset backing the credit card purchases or also additionally the time lag of the debiting,
depending on the interpretation of opportunity costs chosen here. 'D denotes the interest on
the deposits and 'E denotes the interest borne by the network money balances.
Finally, it should be remarked that installation costs, Le. fixed costs that are not dependent
on the transactions, are not included in Whitesell's model. In the case ofInternet payments,
this specification does not appear to be unproblematical at first glance. However, it could
be argued that they are incurred by all payment instruments being examined here and
therefore will most likely not differ all that greatly. All the same, the potentially high costs
of installation could mean that only one form of money will be used.
The cost structure can easily be used to draw conclusions on how different payment media
are used. For example, network money has, by assumption, the lowest fixed costs per
transaction and will most likely be used for low-value transactions (having a high frequency).
Let m be the largest value of n up to which, starting from zero, the consumer uses credit
cards, and let Mbe that value of n starting from which network money is used. Further, let
N be the maximum frequency observed in Ws model. The assumption of an upper bound
for n corresponds to that of a lower bound for the transaction value. In reality, there is
certainly a minimum price at which goods are traded, which means that the assumption of a
maximum transaction frequency included in the model seems plausible and necessary. 1f

In Whitesell's model, in an optimum a relationship is established between the bounds of the
segments within which transactions are uniformly marle with one specifIc payment medium

-16
cheque payment Ps fall, the curve of the costs of a cheque payment shown on the chart
flattens, m shifts to the left, and M shifts to the right. The cheque payment zone is extended at
the expense ofthe other two zones. The following table sums up the relationships.

Here it must be noted that the reactions of the endogenous parameters in Iable 1 to
changes in the model parameters have been derived under the assumption that both in the
old optimum and in the new optimum all three payment media are used.28 Otherwise some
effects might vanish. For example, assuming a situation whereM N, a further rise in the
risk k associated with a network money payment can neither lead to an extension of the
transaction segment for cheque payments, nor does it reduce the segment taken up by
network money. In fact, network money was not even employed in the starting situation,

since the low-value payments where there would be a cost advantage in using cyber money
were lower than the lowest-value transaction actually made.
In WhiteseIl's model, the focus of this section, the main feature of the optimum state is the
general fact that the use of payment media becomes specialised depending on the costs of
using each respective payment medium. 1bey can be classified under certain transaction
segments by the frequencies of a transaction or by the price of the goods purchased. Here,
network money assumes the role of a medium ofexchange for Iow-value payments.
In the light of the key role pIayed by the costs of using each medium of exchange, it would
be desirable not to incorporate them exogenously in the determination of optimal payment
patterns. Rather, it would be preferable to derive them from plausible assumptions
concerning the behaviour of the issuers. This will be done in the next section.
IV. Interaetion between supply and demand
In his model, Wbitesell (1992) looks at the decision problem of a (monopolistic) credit
institution that accepts deposits upon wbich cheques can be drawn. By setting the costs of
payment by cheque r-rD and Ps' the bank can ultimately determine the segment within n
where payments are made by cheque. Whitesell assumes here that the decisions taken by the
other issuers of payment media are exogenously given. 1be credit card industry has set its
costs per transaction (nonnalised at unity), and the transaction costs of cash issued by central
banks are also given. Under these assumptions (and ifN is defined suitably), the transaction
segment for cheques that maximises the credit institutions' profits can be derived. It turns out
that this segment - apart from marginal solutions - makes up half ofthe overall transaction
space.29
The optimisation problem faced by an issuer of network money, however, differs from that
considered by Wbitesell in important respects. For one thing, the transaction segment covered
by cheques is potentially threatened from both sides by other payment media. By contrast, the
transaction segment covered by network money - as shown in Section m-is at the right
29 See Whitesell (1992), p. 488ff.
-18
hand side of the spectrum of frequencies being considered here. This makes the assumption
of a maximum transaction frequency or a minimum price at which a good is still traded a
decisively important one, since it piaces restrictions on the possible transaction segment of
the issuer of network money, thus "forcing" the issuer to compete with other payment media.
For another thing, in Whitesell's model, the issuer of cheques basically has two decision
parameters: interest borne by deposits and the fee associated with a transaction. The extent to
which a transaction fee can be charged for network money, however, depends on the extent to
which network money takes on the character of cash in future - as was discussed in Section
III. Since network money should in principle be able to be passed through the Internet in
independent flows of circulation in the model being discussed here, we will continue not to
incorporate a transaction fee for this medium ofexchange. Therefore, it remains for the issuer
to decide on the potential rate of interest on cyber money balances. In the case of independent
circular flows of network money, this would be interpreted as interest reaped by the initial
holder, who during this one model period under consideration holds cyber money in order to
make transactions at the end of this period.
Besides these modifications of the Whitesell model, which are more of a technical nature,
it would seem desirable also to make a fundamental extension to the decision problem
faced by an issuer of payment media. It can hardly be assumed that the issuers of
competing payment instruments will not react to decisions taken by the others. For that
reason, an approach should be chosen which includes all suppliers in the analysis. In the
following, therefore, a simple model will be introduced which serves to illustrate the
interplay between the demand and the total supply.
For simplicity, only two payment media will be analysed here: credit cards and cyber
money. The cost structure is specified analogously to Section III as follows:
Costs per Transaction costs Opportunity costs
transaction per period per period
Cybermoney kp kY (r-rE)Y
Creditcard PK ßKn -
Thus, those two payment media which differ the most from one another in terms of their
cost to the consumer are included, as their competition is particularly interesting for
analytical purposes.

Thus, it is only possible for the issuer of network money to cover the whole transaction
segment if a) she takes on the loss risk of those holding her payment medium and b) offers
a sufficiently high interest rate on the network money balances. The extent to which the
possibility for the issuer to take on the risk should be additionally integrated into the model
depends again on the type of network money system under consideration. For example, a
system that provides for the participation of the network money issuer in every transaction
will tend to allow the issuer to control the costs she will incur resulting from
malfunctioning and to prevent moral hazard. By contrast, this seems hardly possible in a
system of independent circular flows of network money, since the issuer is unlikely to be
able to verify a case of loss, thus giving the public an incentive to commit fraud. Therefore,
it will be assumed in the following that the issuer of network money cannot take on the risk
involved with her payment instrument. In the light of progress in the field of secure
transmission technology on the Web, however, it should be assumed that the potential
segment of network money transactions will tend to spread out over time. Hence, the
parameter k corresponds to an exogenously given technology on the Internet.30
In the following, a credit card issuer and a network money issuer on the supply side will be
considered, both of whom have a monopoly in their respective markets. Theoretical
arguments and trends in Internet payments which can actually be obselVed both justify
modelling the supply side in this manner. In the literature, in connection with the further
spread of electronic money, it is often pointed out that, owing to network externalities, a
logistical pattern in its spread is likely to occur.31 This corresponds to the idea that in the
early stages of the spread of this innovative payment instrument in the market, the benefits of
network money are relatively modest. The number of traders who accept this form of money
is still relatively smalI. However, once a criticallevel of market penetration is achieved, this
innovation can then spread much more quickly. This, however, means that if a network
money system reaches the point where exponential growth sets in, this makes it much more
difficult for competing systems to take root.32 In fact, trends in the Internet payment system
30 See the literature on Internet payment systems eited in Seetion 11.2.2. 

31 See, for instance. Wehinger (1997), p. 66. 

32 In adynamie model, the development of a competitive market into a monopoly due to network 

externalities could be integrated. One could also study to what extent the existence of network externalities
provides an incentive for each individual issuer to offer a (temporarily higher) rate of interest on the loaded
values, Le. for those issuers who are striving to be the first to achieve exponential growth with their product.
-21
seem to confinn this theory. For one tbing, it can be observed that up to now, for the
software-based cyber money system descri~ in each case oo1y one cred.it institution has
issued this form of money at a natiooalleveI.33 For another thing, the cooperation of various
credit card companies in developing the SET standard indicates that the enterprises are aware
of the risks involved in interfering with one another in an early stage of this innovation, or
that they are aware of the possibility of a bad investment in view of a competing system that
is conquering the market, and thus wish to avoid this occurring.
As far as the issuers' optimisation problem is concemed, the simplest cost structure
possible is assumed. The credit card issuer produces her services at constant marginal costs
of CK > o. No further costs exisL By contrast, the costs of issuing network money are
negligible (CE
=0 ).
Hence, the credit card issuer's profit, depending on the value of p, is as follows:
p 1
I1 K =
J«fJK -cK )n)dn =i(fJK -CK)p2 (7)
o
For the issuer of network money, the profit equation is specified as follows:
N
I1 E
=
J«r-rE)y)dn =(r-rE)Y(N-p) (8)
p
The credit card issuer maximises her profit by choosing a value for fJK · The network
money issuer maximises her profit by choosing a value for rE or r-rE' A (Nash)
equilibrium is reached in the model if neither of the two has an incentive for varying her
decision parameter, given the choice of the other issuer. The equilibrium fce per credit card.
transaction maximises the credit card issuer's profit provided the network money issuer
chooses the equilibrium rate of interest, and vice versa. Therefore, the next step is to derive
the best response in terms of her decision parameter that a monopolist can provide, given
the other's decision parameter.
In the simple model fra:mewort beiDa studied lIeK. this is not possible. Besides. ODe could argue tbat the 

long-term equilibrium inboth models is likely to be the same. 

33 See Digicash (1998). 

-22
Substituting p. from (5) into the profit functions gives the respective profit that takes
account of the impact of the cost parameters on the bound between the segments of the two
payment media. Differentiating these functions with respect to the respective decision
parameters results in the following response functions of the two monopolists:
(9)
(10) 

It turns out that the credit card issuer selects the fee to be charged regardless of the behaviour
of the network money issuer. By contrast, the lower the fee per credit card transaction, the
higher the rate of interest on network money holdings or the lower the spread r - selected
r
E
by the network money issuer will be. Furthermore, the interest on e-money holdings will rise
with an increasing transaction volume per type of good Y. a declining transaction segment N
and a rising risk parameter k. 1bis means an indirect compensation for a rising loss risk.
Furthermore, it proves to be worthwhile for the issuer of cyber money to strive for a greater
market share given rising expenditure per type of good, despite the fact that she will have to
hand over a larger percentage of the (rising) interest income from the float to the holders of e
money. Finally, the issuer reacts to a reduction in the transaction segment being analysed here
by making her medium of payment more attractive to the public so as not to let the remaining
market share become too small.
The equilibrium cost parameters folIowas:

In equilibrium the following bound p. shows up between the segments of the two payment
instruments:

The second-order conditions for a profit maximum are fulfilled. 

-23
Thus. in equilibrium, a division of the market occurs such that both issuers each serve
exactly half of the market for payment media when the loss risk of network money is
negligible. Otherwise, this risk then leads to the market share taken up by network money
being less than half of the market. However, it is halfof the remaining market when taking
into account the fact that the zone up to Jlmm is left for the credit card issuer anyway. The
credit card issuer determines this zone by choosing a transaction fee; therefore, it is by no
means exogenous.35

Taking the supply ofpayment media into account here (as opPOsed to Table 1) means that
some of the parameters which are exogenously given when only the demand side is
considered now become endogenous. Their chosen values can be explained. This affects
the variables ßK (normalised at unity in the Whitesell model) and rE' The result is
sometimes diverging relationships. For example, one result is that - unlike the result
obtained when looking only at the demand side - the market interest rate has no effect

-24
whatsoever on the division of the segments among the payment instruments. The reason is
that whenever the market rate of interest changes, the network money issuer makes the
same adjustment to the interest she offers on e-money holdings.
What seems more important when looking at both sides of the market, though, is the
possibility of analysing the conditions under which network money may come into use for
all transactions. Whereas the model in Section m enables us to state only that as the
interest rate on network money balances goes up, so does the volume of transactions made
using this form of money, additionally taking the supply into account enables us to provide
an answer to the question of whether the level of interest required to supplant payment by
credit card will possibly be set by the issuer. Even though the costs of issuing network
money are nil, in equilibrium there will still be transactions using credit cards. One reason
- as already discussed - is the loss risk associated with network money, which assures
the credit card issuer a positive market share. Another reason illustrated by the model is
that even if the loss risk is negligible, the network money issuer has no incentive to cover
the entire market through the choice of her cost parameter. To this end she would have to
offer the public an interest rate that does not maximise her profit. Thus, when taking the
supply side into account, the result remains a segmentation of the payment system such that
network money assumes the role of a medium of exchange for low-value payments.
V. Concluding remarks
An analysis of the microeconomic foundations of the choice the payer must make between
different payment instruments allows a tentative assessment of the future spread of network
money to be expected. Thus, a cash-in-advance model based on Whitesell (1992) asserts
that specialisation of different payment instruments is a characteristic of the consumer's
optimal payment pattern. Specialisation here means that only one payment medium is
employed to buy a good. Furthermore, payment instruments can be c1assified according to
certain price zones. This applies to the payment pattern in OTC trade, where such
behaviour can actually be observed.36 This also applies to trade on the Internet. Here,
analogously to the use of electronic money in OTC trade, network money is likely to
assume the role of a medium of exchange used for low-value transactions.
-25
This result is confinned by a simple model with two payment instruments which additionally
includes the supply side. Here. it tums out that the use of network money for the entire range
of e~mmerce is not only hampered by the loss risk resulting from the fact that cyber money
is a bearer instrument bot is also at odds with the issuer's profit-maximising behaviour.
However, that makes the scenarios wheJ:e all other media of exchange are substituted
completely by cyber money, potentiallyending up in the existence of a monetary flow
independent of the central bank monopoly (as described in the introduction to this paper),
seem rather unlikely.37 Instead, the impact of the further spread of network: money on
monetary policy - much like that of e-money in over-the-counter trade - is likely to be
limited.
However, the simple model discussed in Section IV leaves out numerous aspects,
especially the role of e-commerce traders in the spmId of certain payment media. In
particular, a detailed modelling ofthe idea that certain markets might potentially be opened
up by electronic money on the Internet would enable us to make more detailed statements
about the development towards the steady stare examined in Section IV. It must also be
remarked that the model examined here only deals with e-commerce on the Internet, thus
necessarily leaving unresolved the issue of substitution between OTC trade and e
commerce. Ultimately this paper seeks to provide an initial impetus towards a genuine
"microfoundation" of the role electronic money is expected to play in payments. On this
basis, in a second step it would be possible to draw conclusions on the resulting
implications for monetary policy.
36 See Deutsche Bundesbank (1999).
37 Besides. it becomes clear from the description in Scction 11.2 of the existing e-mooey systems that no
system which is tecbnically capable of creating an indcpendcnt cin:ular flow of mooey has been implemented
yet. If the tokens created by the software..based system arc used several timcs, this affects the security of that
payment medium against counterfeiting. A further bindrance is also to be seen in purse-to-purse payments not
being possible in all systems. Payments between individuals arc currently possible only in the aforementioned
software-based system aod in ODe of the established card-based systems. See Mondex (1999). In addition, the
very nature of the pilot projects in the field of softwarc-based systems leads to the problem of insufficient
inter-operationality between different issuers. Neither multi-cmrency capability nor multi-bank capability
exists so far.
