Journal of Workplace Rights
Introduction
In France, as in many other countries, increasing attention has
been paid over the past 10 years to stress at work and psycho-
social risks. Work-related suicides, sometimes occurring in
the workplace itself, have left their mark on several large
companies. A group of experts commissioned by the Ministry
of Labor has examined these risks and how to define and
measure them (Gollac, 2011). Employees have, in principle,
been afforded greater protection in legislation and collective
agreements. For all that, European surveys have uncovered a
number of worrying factors linked to new forms of work
intensification. In the service sector, the relationship with the
customer is often highlighted as one of these risk factors.
The present article is based on a case study of bus drivers
in urban environments. We intend to explore what could be
seen as a paradox: a real improvement in the job of bus driver
with shorter working times, but an increase in absenteeism
due to illness and work-related accidents.
The article is structured around two central issues. The
first concerns the new forms of work intensification to which
bus drivers are subject. The second concerns the resources
that are available to bus drivers and whether or not they make
use of them. Following Hirschman (1970), various forms of
exit can be identified although they are limited in France by
the importance of the lifetime employment model in firms
dominated by internal labor markets. The ability of employ-
ees and their representatives to use the new protective rights,
which can be likened to a form of voice, is also limited and
in the cases studied the new rights do not seem to offer any
convincing improvement.
After a general presentation of the job of bus driver and a
review of the literature on the main risks and health conse-
quences, we present our theoretical framework, which is based
on a socio-economic approach. Then, having outlined the
French legal framework and our methodology, we will examine
our results on the new forms of intensification and arduousness
affecting bus drivers'work. We will then consider the resources
that employees and their organizations deploy or fail to deploy.
Bus Drivers' Working Conditions: A

"A plus Dans le Bus": Work-Related
Stress Among French Bus Drivers
Nathalie Louit-Martinod1, Cécile Chanut-Guieu1,
Cathel Kornig1, and Philippe Méhaut1
Abstract
In France, as in many other countries, considerable attention has been paid to health and safety at work and more particularly
to the psycho-social risks associated with work. A case study carried out among bus drivers in urban environments in five
companies belonging to one of the largest French public transport groups reveals that drivers' health and well-being at work
has deteriorated even though the machinery and equipment they use have improved and working time has been reduced.
Besides the usual risks to which bus drivers are exposed, new forms of work intensification have emerged, linked to budgetary
constraints, urban policies, quality control, geolocation, and verbal and physical assaults. These factors influence working
conditions and workloads. This raises the question of the resources deployed by the drivers and/or their representatives.
Following Hirschman, various forms of exit are identified, although the new protective rights that have been introduced,
which can be likened to a form of voice, do not seem strong enough to reduce the psycho-social risks.

It faces significant safety issues as it involves the transport
of people. The job has an "industrial" dimension as it
involves driving a vehicle while complying with a series of
norms, particularly with regard to time schedules. Bus driv-
ers can also be said to be shift workers, alternating early
morning, mid-day, and evening/night shifts, as in large fac-
tories. However, it is also a service activity, with drivers in
permanent contact with passengers. Drivers must divide
their time and attention between the road and the inside and
outside of the bus to ensure that passengers obey the rules
(Joseph, 1992).
There has undoubtedly been an improvement in the tech-
nical equipment: The driver's cab is better designed and the
buses have air conditioning and modern communications
systems. In France, a reduction in working time following
the introduction of the 35-hr week has also been applied to
bus drivers. Nevertheless, the health indicators are deterio-
rating and seem to suggest that these workers have suffered a
deterioration in their health and well-being at work. Thus,
across France as a whole, time off for accidents at work and
work-related ill health has increased in the passenger trans-
port sector (20 days for sickness, 5.2 for accidents and work-
related ill health in 2013). The same applies, more generally,
to absence from work (regardless of cause; 28 days in 2013,
22.3 in 2004). Besides the budgetary pressures that weigh
increasingly heavily on the companies that employ them and
have repercussions for the drivers themselves, their work is
being subjected to ever greater control and monitoring, both
internally and externally. And yet drivers are still in sole
charge of their vehicles, in non-confined jobs (as defined by
Hatchuel, 2002). However, they have to deal with new uncer-
tainties linked to the customer relationship and to their work-
ing environment. These new forms of intensification might
explain why certain indicators of well-being at work have
deteriorated.
The Physical and Mental Risks of Bus
Driving: A Literature Review
Bus drivers as an occupational group have long attracted
considerable attention. One of the reasons for this attention
lies in their responsibility toward the traveling public. Tse,
Flin, and Mearns (2006), for example, carried out an exten-
sive literature survey covering a period of 50 years. And in
France, since the beginning of the 20th century, the RATP
(Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens; the Paris public
transport operator) has been conducting psycho-technical
tests to evaluate aspiring drivers' skills and aptitude.
Recognized and Fairly Well-Documented Physical
Risks
There is an extensive literature on the main physical risks
(accidents or illnesses) to which bus drivers are prey. A not
insignificant share of this literature comes from the world of
medicine or ergonomics. Although they are still sometimes
contested (cancers linked to pollution; Soll-Johanning, Bach,
& Jensen, 2003), the physical risk factors and the subsequent
damage to health have been identified, a fairly broad consen-
sus on them has been reached, and preventive measures have
been put in place. Tse et al. (2006) list them (see also Thierry,
Chouanière, & Aubry, 2008, for a more general survey of
professional drivers).
We will make only brief mention of them here. Our analy-
ses and observations have confirmed these main risk factors
(notably through analysis of the causes of absences because
of workplace accidents and/or occupational disorders).
The factors listed here are those linked to the material
working conditions: prolonged periods of sitting, driving
gestures and postures, state of the roads, and vehicle suspen-
sion and noise, which combine to produce a series of prob-
lems, notably musculoskeletal disorders (lower back pain,
damage to shoulders and elbows, falls when getting off bus)
and heart conditions.
Also listed are pathologies associated mainly with the
organization of working time and the organic disorders
linked to shift work, including sleep problems, gastro-intes-
tinal complaints, and tiredness.
Stress, Psycho-Social Risks, and Assaults
Here too, the literature is consistent. In their model, Tse et al.
identify violence and traffic jams as risk factors attributed to
the "physical environment," in the same way as the previous
factors (2006, p. 90). However, they emphasize the impor-
tance of risk factors linked to physical assaults (which we put
in the same category as stress and other psycho-social risks,
as they are different from pathologies directly linked to the
vehicles, the physical working conditions, the organization
of working time, etc.). Several studies, a high share of them
by doctors, measure the psycho-physiological disorders
related to stress (adrenaline levels, etc.), particularly in com-
parisons between men and women (Aronsson & Rissler,
1998). Evans and Carrère (1991) do the same, with positive
conclusions regarding the impact of traffic jams and increases
in certain biological parameters indicative of stress.
Theoretical Approach
We take a different approach, focusing mainly on the way by
which drivers are able to mobilize organizational resources
(individual and collective) to cope with the new (or increas-
ing) factors of stress.
Hirschman (1970), with his notions of exit, voice, and
loyalty, provides an analytical framework that can be used to
address this question. This framework has been mainly built
to analyze consumer's strategies (and/or strategies of the
users of organizations such as political parties). However, it
has been also used in the socio-economics of labor (Gazier,
1991) to explain quit or voice processes among workers
Louit-Martinod et al. 3
enduring poor wages or bad working conditions, to under-
stand union's strategies. In this article, the bad working con-
ditions are only related to the stress. The notion of voice
must be extended to include all forms of collective action,
including the role of bilateral, institutional committees. In
these committees, unions are present but not alone. The
notion of exit also needs to be somewhat reorganized. In the
French context of internal labor markets (typical for bus
firms) and high levels of unemployment, quitting is not a
resource. And the labor turnover is rather low. However,
internal mobility, changing from one route to another or from
bus driving to other positions, constitutes a highly codified
set of resources and opportunities on which bus drivers can
build careers with the company, and avoid some of the risky
job places. As emphasized in Hirschman book, as well as in
other, more labor-oriented analyses, quit and voice must be
combined and not opposed. Moreover, as we will see, some
internal "quitting strategies" are regulated and sometimes
deriving from the voice power. This is a way of understand-
ing how driver's rights are (or not) mobilized and of bridging
the gap between medical and psychological analyses and
more sociological and economic approaches
Coming now to some of these more socio-organizational
approaches, the most frequently used model is that devel-
oped by Karasek (1979). Quite apart from its academic suc-
cess, its simplicity means it has been taken up by many
management consultants to measure psycho-social risks.
This was the case in one of the companies investigated, inci-
dentally. Nevertheless, this model is mainly based on the
situation in manufacturing companies and occupations and
seems to us less well suited to analyses of service companies
and occupations. While some variables are fundamental,
such as support (from peers or management, which we
encountered in our case studies), drivers engage in more
interaction with passengers in the co-production of the ser-
vice (De Bandt & Gadrey, 1994) and, more broadly, with the
external environment (in the case of "non-confined" drivers
in Hatchuel's sense of the term (Hatchuel, 2002) than with
their peers or with management. Gimeno, Benavides, Mira,
Martinez, and Benach (2004) suggest that bus incidents and
regulating actions have an impact on psychological risks;
however, the impact of passengers' behaviors is not signifi-
cantly correlated. However, other studies, many of them case
studies with more of a sociological slant, emphasize the
importance of rudeness and violence for drivers' health
(Jones, Haslam, & Haslam, 2013; Loubet-Deveaux, 2003;
Sliter, Jex, Wolford, & McInnerney, 2010) and for the vari-
ous mediators who may or may not enable drivers to with-
stand the tension. Thus, Gandibleux and Dartois (2006)
emphasize the importance of factors such as traffic jams and
rudeness for drivers' stress. Contradictory demands (driving
style/commercial considerations, schedules/quality of inter-
action with passengers, etc.) give rise to tensions linked to
occupational identity that may also affect driving style and
cause physical and mental problems. In that sense, we are
close to the emotional labor approach to service work
(Korczynski & Macdonald, 2009; Sliter et al., 2010), which
is an often underestimated part of bus drivers' work and of
their pride (and difficulties) in serving passengers in the pub-
lic space.
However, understanding the change in the public space
needs also a broader perspective, including the consequences
of the changing economic regulations of the urban trans-
ports. Hasle (2007) has investigated how the privatization of
urban transport has changed the relationships between com-
missioning bodies, on one hand, and subcontractors and their
employees, on the other. Responsibilities for health and
safety issues have become blurred, which is likely to affect
drivers' health. In a long-term investigation of a large trans-
port company, Gallenga (2011) reveals the tensions gener-
ated by new public management and the increase in the
number of unsafe situations drivers experience.
These are the avenues we intended to pursue in the
remainder of this article. Our aims are first to gain a better
understanding of the complex causes and forms of work
intensification (Askenazy, 2005; Hatchuel, 2002), to see how
these general forms apply to a particular case, that of bus
drivers in subcontractor companies bound by public procure-
ment contracts (Coppe & Gautier, 2004, Van de Velde, 1999).
We can then develop our own re-interpretation of
Hirschman to combine exit and voice strategies, focusing
only on the way in which, within the firm, bus drivers cope
with the psycho-social risks linked to the relationship with
customers and road users in a new economic context.
Protection Against Psycho-Social Risks:
The French Legal Framework
It is only fairly recently that the law in France, as in the rest
of the European Union, has provided protection against psy-
cho-social risks. As early as 1946, after all, the World Health
Organization had declared that "Health is a complete state of
physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the
absence of disease or infirmity" (World Health Organization,
1946, p. 100). However, it was not until 2002 and the enact-
ment of legislation rendering bullying at work illegal that
workers' mental health was protected in the same way as
their physical health. It is true that the notion itself is difficult
to define, encompassing as it does various forms of suffering
at work: bullying, violence, stress, depression, burn-out, and
so forth. And in fact, with the exception of bullying, there is
no legal definition of these risks. This has not prevented
French trade unions and employers' associations, faced with
a rise in mental health problems in the workplace and spurred
on by the social partners at European level (2004 and 2007
framework agreements), from seizing on the question and
negotiating two national intersectoral agreements, one on
workplace stress (2008) and the other on bullying and vio-
lence (2010). Nevertheless, while these agreements certainly
raised awareness and set out a general framework for action,
4 SAGE Open
they are not very restrictive. After all, they cannot achieve
their full effect unless they are incorporated into company
agreements that put in place concrete risk prevention mea-
sures. To that end, and following several suicides among
workers in a large, formerly state-owned telecommunica-
tions company, the Ministry of Labor in 2009 encouraged
companies with more than 1,000 employees to start negotia-
tions on workplace stress or risk being included in a blacklist
to be published on the Internet.
Under pressure from the "bad boys," this "blacklist"
remained in the public domain for just one day. It was
replaced by a list of companies that had signed agreements,
or at least put in place action plans. Thus, one of the compa-
nies investigated (TramBus) drew up an action plan in con-
sultation with the workforce representative bodies and the
trade union delegates. However, it would seem that, in gen-
eral, the social partners have not really taken up these issues.
At the same time, the prevention of psycho-social risks was
declared a priority by the government in its Health in the
Workplace Plan 2010-2014, while various reports on the
question have been produced by researchers (Gollac, 2011;
Lachmann, Larose, & Penicaud, 2010; Nasse & Légeron,
2008) and parliamentarians (Dériot, 2010; Lefrand, 2011).
What obligations do employers have with regard to these
risks? In France, the answer to this question is to be found in
case law, where the legislation has been interpreted strictly.
The transposition into French law of Framework Directive
89/231/EC of 12 June 1989 on the implementation of mea-
sures intended to promote improvements in workers' health
and safety led the legislature to impose an obligation on
employers to put in place prevention policies in the work-
place. It was incorporated into French law with the following
wording: "Employers shall take all the measures necessary
to ensure the safety and to protect the physical and mental
health of workers" (Article L. 4121-1, paragraph 1 of the
French Labour Code). Furthermore,
The obligation to maintain employees' health . . . requires
employees to put in place a company health policy. The
company's responsibility in matters of health and safety shall no
longer be confined to limiting absences from work and cases of
unfitness. (Moreau, 2002, p. 817)
Thus, the principle underlying the legislation is no longer the
reparation of damage caused but rather the prevention of
damage. The new principle manifests itself notably in the
obligation placed on employers to compile a single risk
assessment document that takes psycho-social risks in par-
ticular into account. And in the past 10 years, employers'
responsibilities in health and safety matters have been fur-
ther extended by French case law. The United Kingdom's
Health and Safety at Work Act, which states that "It shall be
the duty of every employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably
practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his
employees," was judged to be compliant with the 1989
Directive by the European Court of Justice (EJC; June 14,
2007, case C-127/05, Commission v. United Kingdom), while
employers in many other countries are obliged to use "best
endeavours" in safeguarding health and safety in the work-
place (Lerouge, 2014). However, the French courts have
turned this obligation on employers to prevent harm into a
performance obligation. In other words, while employers in
the United Kingdom and many other European countries are
obliged to provide the means to safeguard health and safety,
French employers are under an obligation to achieve certain
results. This performance obligation on employers, which
emerged originally out of cases brought under social security
legislation by victims of asbestosis and their families (nota-
bly SA Everite v. André Gerbaud, Cour de cassation, February
28, 2002, n° 00-13172), was then extended to labor law, par-
ticularly in cases of bullying. This process continued with an
important decision in Snecma v. The CGT trade union (Cour
de cassation, March 5, 2008, n° 06-45888) in which the
Court declared "that he [the employer] is forbidden, in exer-
cising his right to manage, to take measures that have the
aim or the effect of compromising employees' health and
safety." Thus, the Cour de Cassation (the final court of appeal
in France) took the view that a form of organization an
employer decides to introduce can be suspended by the
courts on the grounds that it might harm employees'physical
and/or mental health even though no damage has yet been
observed. Thus, "the health imperative prevails over the right
to manage, which may be set aside if it is used intentionally
to compromise an employee's health or is used in such a way
that his or her health is compromised" (Verkindt, 2008,
p. 520). While sole responsibility rests with the employer,
workforce representative bodies can play an important role
in matters of health and safety at work.
In accordance with national and international standards,
employees' health and safety form part of the remit of all
employee representatives (Verkindt, 2007). However, it is
the committee for health, safety, and working conditions
(CHSCT in French), which, as a specialized institution, has a
major role to play in the fight against psycho-social risks in
France. This role has been growing constantly in recent
years, as issues related to health in the workplace have grown
in importance. Companies or establishments with at least 50
employees have to establish a CHSCT. In smaller organiza-
tions, it is the workforce representatives, where there are any,
who carry out some at least of the committee's duties. The
committee is made up of the managing director, who in law
is the chair, and a delegation elected by the workforce. Other
members include the company doctor and the head of health
and safety, acting in an advisory capacity. Finally, the health
and safety inspectorate and officials of the social security
organizations' prevention services must be informed of all
committee meetings and may attend them. The CHSCT's
brief is "to contribute to the protection of employees' health
and safety" (Articles L. 4612-1 to 18 of the Labour Code). To
this end, the committee is charged with analyzing working
Louit-Martinod et al. 5
conditions and occupational hazards and has to be consulted
by the employer prior to any significant change to the system
of work organization. The CHSCT must meet at least once
every 3 months at the request of the managing director, as
well as after any serious accident and if at least two of its
members request a meeting. The CHSCT may call on experts
of its own choosing, particularly in the event of a serious
hazard within the company or a proposed reorganization that
would significantly modify working conditions or health and
safety conditions. The employer is responsible for paying the
experts.
Method
This article is based on research (Askenazy, Cartron, &
Prunier-Poulmaire, 2014) carried out between 2011 and 2014
in a large French group, one division of which provides
urban passenger transport services, primarily bus services.
Almost 250 companies employed more than 50,000 people
in this division during our survey. The number of employees
is growing, mainly through the acquisition of independent
companies.
Statistical data for a period of 7 years derived from human
resources (HR) reporting provide a series of indicators on
size of workforce, HR policy (e.g., intensity of employee
training), turnover, and absence rate (and the main causes of
absence: illness and workplace accidents). It is well known
that these data could sometimes underestimate the situation
(no declaration of workplace accident . . .). In our two big-
gest firms, they are carefully monitored by the CHSCT.
Nevertheless, we will see later that there are indices of under-
estimation. Data reveal a similar increase in illness and acci-
dents for all transport firms, albeit at a slightly lower level.
Five companies in the division were analyzed in depth. They
are of varying size and operate in large urban areas and
medium-sized towns. One of the criteria for selecting them
was the variety of absence rates, which is an indicator usu-
ally regarded in the literature as reflecting varying levels of
ill health, or a certain degree of well-being or malaise at
work.
In each of the five companies, we analyzed the main doc-
uments relating to their economic situation and their charac-
teristics in terms of HR and policies on health and safety at
work.
A total of 23 drivers were subjected to analysis while car-
rying out all or part of their duties. Positioned behind the
driver, the observer(s) systematically compiled a register of
the constituent elements of the drivers' work and their
exchanges with users (e.g., counting the number of times
they verbally greeted passengers getting on the bus).
Incidents with passengers as well as with other road users
(congested roads, refusal to give way, etc.) were counted.
The results were summarized in an "observation file."
Following these analyses of the drivers at work, interviews
were conducted with them (34 in total; 11 were not observed
while at work). All the drivers who were followed and inter-
viewed were volunteers, recruited by a poster campaign. The
interviews took about an hour each and focused on the inter-
viewees' career trajectories, the various aspects of the occu-
pation, their work, their health, and their relationships with
colleagues and management. They all followed a common
semi-structured interview protocol.
Thirty interviews were also carried out in the five firms
with managerial and supervisory staff (director, HR manag-
ers, service quality managers, and the drivers' immediate
supervisors). These interviews were of variable duration (1
hr minimum, sometimes 2 or 3) and focused on the various
facets of HR management and health and safety policy. In the
two largest firms, a total of nine interviews were also con-
ducted with employee representatives, including members of
the CHSCT.
All the interviews were analyzed through a thematic com-
puter tool, and by cross analyses of our team.
In the following section, we present some of our results on
work intensification and the socio-organizational responses.
New Forms of Work Intensification:
Bus Drivers and Their Onerous
Working Conditions
The main pathological conditions from which bus drivers
suffer are well known. We are focusing here rather on the
risks--the stressors--arising out of the various forms of
work intensification and onerous working conditions associ-
ated with the customer relationship and, more broadly, with
working in an urban environment. We are, after all, dealing
with a paradoxical situation. First, the drivers we inter-
viewed, and particularly the older ones, were eager to point
out that the vehicles they drove had improved, particularly
the ergonomics of their cabs and the vehicles' suspension.
That's improved dramatically in 50 years . . . Before, there were
massive steering wheels, no heating . . . It was hard. (Driver)
Second, working time for French bus drivers has been cut
following the introduction of the 35-hr week.
However, absence rates are rising. New types of work-
related accident are emerging. There are strong indications of
malaise despite the active preventive policies implemented
by management. This makes it necessary to explore in what
respects and in what ways the new forms of work intensifica-
tion may generate stress, malaise, and new psycho-social
risks.
Budgetary Tensions Impact on Working
Conditions
There is growing pressure from transport authorities to limit
operating costs. This pressure manifests itself through the
6 SAGE Open
process of competitive tendering that takes place when con-
tracts come up for renewal. However, it can also manifest
itself during the term of a contract when routes are being
reorganized (shift from little used to heavily used routes) and
the transport authority refuses to take account of any new
costs that are incurred while a contract is in force.
This pressure is reflected in particular in the stricter man-
agement of manning levels and equipment in a context in
which passenger numbers are rising. More specifically, it
may lead to
·
· a reduction in front-line supervisory staff, which con-
tributes in part to the emergence of a feeling of isola-
tion and lack of management support
·
· a reduction in the number of relief drivers, which in
turn reduces flexibility in case of absence
·
· tighter management of the ratio of the number of
buses to services, which ultimately affects work, job
content, and working conditions
·
· a tendency to concentrate services on "profitable"
routes, that is, high-density routes (high passenger
volumes, heavy traffic, etc.), which drivers often see
as nerve-racking
When a driver's got a few kilometers under his belt, they put
him on the profitable routes, the high-density ones, where the
job is more arduous. (Secretary of CHSCT)
The buses on route X are cattle trucks. The articulated buses take
110 to 120 people; on route X, they take 150 to 200! (Driver)
The optimization of vehicle numbers and of journey times
reduces the room for maneuver in case of unforeseen prob-
lems (breakdowns, diversions, road works, traffic jams, etc.)
and increases drivers' work rates and their workloads. This
tends in turn to reduce "breathing" times and to aggravate
driver fatigue and stress:
. . . You can't greet passengers in the same way on the busy
routes, when there's always people getting on and you have to
sell them tickets straight away and then get moving again,
you're always playing catch-up . . .
The atmosphere is a bit tense in the center of town, where there's
a lot of people, a lot of stress and it's hot . . . whereas as you get
further away toward the final destination, the passengers are
polite, they say goodbye unprompted from the back of the bus.
(Drivers)
Urban Policies Influence Workloads
The pressure in favor of heavily used routes, already alluded
to above, cannot be explained solely by a concern with prof-
itability. Traffic congestion in town centers and growing con-
cern about environmental degradation are further factors
driving the expansion of public transport. TramBus and
SouthBus operate in cities where these are all crucial issues.
TramBus has put in place a bus lane system throughout the
city center. This has enabled the company to increase service
frequency and, in principle, cut down on disputes with car
drivers. At peak times, however, service frequency is so high
that the bus lanes become choked and the endless lines of
buses threaten, paradoxically, to block all other traffic. They
also put pedestrians at increased risk. For SouthBus, which
operates in a city between sea and mountains, the heavy car
traffic on a number of main routes impedes regular bus flows,
which is a source of tensions with passengers as well as with
motorists.
Quality Control Is Being Tightened, With
Paradoxical Effects
The pressure from transport authorities to raise service qual-
ity has tended to intensify. The indicators have proliferated,
both within companies and without. They may give rise to
contradictory demands. Thus, increasingly stringent punctu-
ality requirements, which are more closely monitored thanks
to the permanent use of geolocation, sometimes encourage
drivers to cut their break times, to drive less smoothly to the
detriment of passenger comfort or to carry out tasks concur-
rently, such as giving change while starting off in order not to
fall behind schedule.
Although new electronic payment systems have tended to
reduce the use of cash and standard tickets, drivers who, on
French one-man buses act as conductors as well and are
therefore responsible for handing out tickets and change and
checking passengers have tickets, are often also subject to
paradoxical demands. Checking passengers is more difficult
when the bus is more or less overloaded or when it is late. It
can also give rise to disputes with passengers. Nevertheless,
part of the operating companies' revenue depends on their
ability to make passengers pay. Teams of inspectors regularly
board buses, but this can also be a source of tension, as the
following observation demonstrates: Second time inspectors
have boarded the bus during the observation period. Five
inspectors board the bus, the police stay outside. A couple
traveling without tickets start to lay into the inspectors, the
man swearing at them ("arsehole"). The female driver
watches and the bus remains stationary, until the chief
inspector says "Drive on," before finishing booking the pair
despite the fact that they wanted to get off. "You can let them
off at the next stop." Normally, they (the inspectors) should
lodge a complaint, it's a lack of respect. "You (the observers)
chose the right bus!"
Nevertheless, drivers retain permanent responsibility
for checking passengers. For many of them, particularly
the older ones, this is an integral part of their public ser-
vice mission and of fairness between passengers.
Sometimes, however, they have to dispense with it, and on
occasions are even implicitly instructed to do so by their
supervisors.
Louit-Martinod et al. 7
Let it go, yes. For me, it's the inspector's job. They just have to
ask if it's validated. It's not worth going any further. (Interviewer:
That's what you tell them. Or is it what the company tells them?)
It's what I say to them, but it's a personal thing. (Unit manager)
Although compliance with quality criteria is part of a cer-
tain "pride in public service," those criteria can at the same
time be a source of heightened tension.
The Increased Use (Currently Ongoing) of Direct
Geolocation by Customers Is Causing Anxiety
New technologies adopted to improve service quality and
passenger information are also changing passengers' rela-
tionship with drivers. This is the case, for example, with the
display of waiting times at bus stops, as well as information
received on smartphones. "They leave home at the last min-
ute, just as I'm passing by" (Driver). "They question us more
if we're late" (Driver). These new tools are being received
with a certain degree of doubt, not to say fear. Geolocation
also facilitates increased monitoring of drivers and their
compliance with schedules. In four of our cases, it is com-
bined with a radio link with a control center that enables
operators to not only enquire about the reasons for any delays
but also to help drivers in the event of an incident (by calling
the police, for example). Thus, these new technologies have
two contrasting aspects.
Rudeness and Aggression: How Can Drivers
Remain in Sole Charge of Their Vehicles?
As in many service activities involving direct contact with
the public, the relationship between bus drivers and passen-
gers, or between bus drivers and other road users, can some-
times be strained. These relationships are well-known
stressors (Gandibleux & Dartois, 2006) and sometimes give
rise to illness and/or accident reports.
The boundary between what clearly constitutes aggres-
sion and what constitutes rudeness is often difficult to estab-
lish. Andersson and Pearson (1999) suggest that "incivility is
low intensity deviant behaviour with ambiguous intent to
harm the target, in violation of workplace norms of mutual
respect" (p. 457). Analysis of drivers' statements on this
question made during the interviews we conducted clearly
reveals the difficulty of defining this notion and the differ-
ences in individuals' perceptions of (and reactions to)
incidents.
Three of the five networks tend to be regarded as quiet.
Nevertheless, even on these, the overwhelming majority of
drivers we met reported that they had been exposed to rude
behavior by passengers, ranging from indifference "you
don't even exist" via impoliteness (not saying hallo, asking
for a ticket while speaking on a mobile phone) to various
forms of damage to the vehicle.
Relations with customers have deteriorated since the complaints
system was put in place. The customer's king now.
That reflects society, people are always in a hurry, increasingly
self-centered, you sense it in some people. But if it really got too
unpleasant, I'd think about quitting, doing something else. For the
moment, they're isolated cases, I don't lose it with people every
day. I called the depot on the voice link and explained the problem.
We talk things over and I think it's good, there's a psychological
trick we can use because we can put the voice link through the
loudspeakers and when the drivers call we can use this facility and
try to put the frighteners on. It wasn't planned at all, the guy on the
voice link just told me the inspectors were all busy and that he was
sending the police . . . The girls got off straightaway. But they
threw stones at me when I started off again. People really love
throwing stones at buses. They were just pebbles, there was no
damage to the bus, I got a move on, I saw them again some time
afterwards . . . So there you are, there are a few little things you
can do on the radio to help with safety on the bus. (Drivers)
Incidents of verbal and physical aggression (swearing,
spitting, and sometimes punches) were reported to us on
these quiet networks as well as on routes on the fourth net-
work, which is regarded as more problematic.
Yes, there've been some spitting incidents, I've been spat on
twice. . . . I got a relief driver in and made a formal complaint
straightaway. There was no wriggling out of it. After that, there
was another incident, more sexual this time . . . One morning I
found myself alone with just one man on the bus, but I hadn't seen
him, he was already playing with himself, he came up to me with
his trousers round his ankles, penis in his hand, and he tried to
touch me. That's when things really kicked off! I opened the door
and told him to get off. I made a formal complaint, spent hours
and hours at the police station . . . Well, they caught him . . . We
have to deal with that kind of thing as well. (Female bus driver)
However, these situations are difficult to quantify because
of the vagueness of the underlying notions.
Careful examination of the work-related accident reports
at Trambus shows that a lot of them concern incidents involv-
ing "the head," without it being possible to identify whether
the harm caused was the result of a fall, a blow, or serious
stress. Another factor (and one that is revealing of this diffi-
culty) is the inadequacy of the information provided by driv-
ers. In three of the five networks, where management has
introduced "incident cards," there has been a steady decrease
in the number of cards being filled out, even though all the
drivers'statements confirm the extent of passenger rudeness.
Drivers seem to have become accustomed or even resigned
to these incidents, particularly because management often
file the cards away under the heading "no action."
Rudeness, Also Outside of the Bus
Although there are frequent references in the literature to the
customer relationship, much less is said about the relationship
8 SAGE Open
with other road users. However, it is clear from the observa-
tions and interviews that this is an important stressor. Traffic
jams, which cause delays, are a frequent occurrence and can
increase annoyance among passengers. This is particularly
the case at TramBus and SouthBus.
Right, now, there's no doubt, given the increase in cars, if we
don't quickly develop areas where buses can circulate easily,
it's going to get more and more difficult. It's a worry, because
in order to be able to move at all, you're obliged to force your
way through from time to time, so you know you're going to
upset someone at some point. There are people who'll let you
jostle your way through, you just say sorry and it's OK, but
others, you have to give them a toot on your horn to ask them
to wait and they fly off the handle straightaway . . . So I think
the traffic has an enormous effect on our working conditions.
Badly parked cars, even in dedicated bus lanes, force us to
maneuver round them. Someone once suggested I should lodge
a complaint . . . (Interviewer: Had something serious
happened?) I had positioned myself badly at an intersection
and as it was choked up I was stopping other people going
when they had a green light. This individual was hurling insult
after insult, I just closed the window and let him rant. He
continued swearing like a trooper, I got going and a little
further on a guy said to me: "The maniac who was swearing at
you, he set off behind you and he jumped the lights and
tomorrow he'll be summoned to the police station. Do you
want to press charges for insulting behavior?" He was a police
superintendent, a superintendent in plain clothes who had
witnessed the scene . . . (Driver)
Drivers make frequent reference to such acts of rudeness
or aggression by road users against them. Accidents can also
be traumatizing (a pedestrian was run over by a TramBus
vehicle just prior to our visit) and may also give rise to penal-
ties or sanctions (a MediumBus driver who caused an acci-
dent was threatened with dismissal but was defended by his
colleagues and the trade union).
Taken together, the factors described above are conspiring
to change the job, a development often referred to in terms of
deterioration, loss of identity, and various forms of work
intensification giving rise to psycho-social risks. This may
partly explain the diffuse sense of unease and anxiety that is
reflected in, among other things, an increase in absence rates,
as well as other types of reaction.
Exit and/or Voice: What Resources
Do Drivers and Their Organizations
Deploy or Fail to Deploy?
Adopting while revisiting Hirschman's long-established cat-
egories, we turn now to an analysis of the various resources
and strategies deployed by drivers and their representatives.
We begin by examining the various forms of individual exit
before turning to the forms of voice, which draw mainly on
the resources available to French workers under the terms of
collective agreements or labor legislation.1
Forms of Exit Revisited
In Hirschman's approach, the principal exit option is the pos-
sibility of leaving the firm.
Leaving the firm.LittleBus and, to a lesser extent, CarBus
demonstrate this exit option. In formal terms, LittleBus has
the best results for absences, with low levels of illness and
work-related accidents. It is also the company whose drivers
seem to lodge the fewest complaints. However, the highest
share of absences is attributed to "other causes." Moreover,
labor turnover is very high (Table 1). LittleBus operates in a
"difficult" suburban area. However, its drivers have numer-
ous alternative employment opportunities because of the
proximity of a major airport (a lot of buses operate in and
around it) and of a large transport operator serving the whole
of the urban area that can offer better employment conditions
and pay. Although we were unable to track the drivers who
left, the high level of turnover can certainly be interpreted as
reflecting a desire on the drivers' part to improve their work-
ing and employment conditions. CarBus differs from the
other operators in having a high share of part-time employ-
ees (school buses and medium-distance inter-city routes).
CarBus is undergoing considerable changes (growth, incor-
poration of urban routes, and a radical change in its pricing
structure, which has led to a very sharp increase in passenger
numbers and a change in the passenger populations). The
company management referred to the heightened tension this
has generated for drivers and the increasing attractiveness for
them of the urban routes, which give them full-time employ-
ment and better pay.

Changing job through internal mobility.For the other three
companies, stability prevails. Against a background of high
unemployment and an absence of other employers in the
transport sector, opportunities for external mobility are few
and far between. These companies have all retained their
strong internal labor markets, with open-ended employment
contracts and pay rises determined by seniority. To that
extent, they have inherited the public sector norms that
applied to the sector before the rapid development of
privatization.
So what forms does "internal exit" take? We identified
three main ones, the products both of company agreements
and more informal internal practices.
Changing route. The first is the possibility of changing route
within the context of the "annual subsidies" to the routes,
which are essentially determined by seniority. In this way,
employees can move from being just "drivers" (i.e., not
assigned to a particular route) to being assigned to a particu-
lar route, after which they can change routes in order, for
example, to avoid the most overcrowded ones or those going
through areas regarded as potentially troublesome.
No, on route x. I wanted to drive articulated buses . . . But it's
true that the people who use the buses on route x are not great
. . . I was beginning to get depressed, to be aggressive, they
were aggressive to me so I responded in kind, and I didn't like
working under those conditions and so I asked to change.
(Female bus driver)
TramBus is an interesting case. Besides its bus services,
this company also operates a tram system. The tram drivers
are separated from passengers in their own cab at the front of
the tram and have less contact with traffic. Consequently,
switching from bus to tram is a form of exit strategy; such a
move also provides access to a job regarded as being of higher
status or more "dignified," including by management.
Nevertheless, as noted before, the scope for choice in this
area is declining as the allegedly "easier" low-density routes
disappear. Moreover, these changes of route are governed by
implicit rules, with seniority being the main criterion
enabling drivers to make the switch.
Changing occupation.
The second form of internal exit
involves having recourse to the so-called "incapacity" or
"unfitness" mechanism. A driver declared unfit to drive
(temporarily or permanently) by the company doctor must be
redeployed internally as a matter of priority if a position is
available (in the absence of any alternative job, he or she
may legally be dismissed). We encountered such situations
mainly at TramBus and SouthBus, both large companies
with a strong trade union presence. At TramBus, extensive
use is made of declarations of unfitness to drive without dis-
missals; the system is virtually co-managed by the union. At
the time of our observations, almost 100 drivers had been
declared unfit to drive and were employed in other positions,
whether in the workshops or offices or on park maintenance.
To increase the scope for internal mobility, the company had
brought back in house certain non-core activities that had
previously been outsourced. When interviewed, some driv-
ers still in post pointed out the ambiguities of these positions
and even criticized what they regarded as nothing but "career
strategies." However, in a company with a chronic budget
deficit, this situation was becoming untenable. One year
after our investigation, management decided to abandon the
lifetime employment policy and initiated procedures for dis-
missing the drivers declared unfit. At SouthBus, without
being quite as problematic, declarations of unfitness to drive
gave rise to a dispute with the company doctor. Some over-
weight employees had been declared unfit to drive; the doc-
tor's judgments were rejected by both management and the
trade unions.
He declared that the buses weren't designed to take drivers
above a certain weight, off the top of my head I think it was 140
kilos or 130 kilos, but you can't just declare a limit like that. At
our place, if he did that, he'd be getting rid of half the workforce.
(CHSCT)
Bending the rules. Somewhere between exit and voice, some
drivers try to circumvent the contradictory directives stem-
ming from the instructions they receive, some of which they
regard as inappropriate. At the risk of being sanctioned, they
alter or even disregard these instructions.
This applies, for example, to the rules governing access to
the buses:
For me, if they get on through the rear door . . . (Interviewer: So,
you don't care about that . . . do you do it?) Yes. I do it, because
I don't want to see them. I open the rear door first, and then the
front door. You shouldn't do it, but well . . . (Driver)
There's a rule about the interior of the buses, we can't apply it.
Baby buggies and pushchairs have to be folded up and babies
carried. If we started doing that, we'd never get going . . .
(Interviewer: So you don't do it.) No. You can't You can't. And
we go through the estate, there are women with double or triple
buggies. What're we supposed to do? Are they going to carry all
the babies in their arms? No. (Driver)
It also applies to the way in which drivers react to rudeness
and aggression. In our five cases, the instructions to drivers
are the same: Do not respond and do not move from the cab.
Some drivers obey the instructions. For others, who intend to
remain "in sole control of their buses," that rule has to be
bent, particularly to obtain passengers' respect.
We don't have any instructions. Well, no, actually, we're
supposed to keep our mouths shut so as not to get into an
argument. That's a bit much, because if we just keep our mouths
shut, we look like wimps to the passengers and that lot, they'll
10 SAGE Open
eat us alive. And you won't be able to get any respect . . . So, I
do open my mouth a bit. Particularly on one route, where the
passengers are often regulars. If they do that to you once, the
next time they'll spit in your face and the time after they'll take
a pop at you. Things start to get out of control, you have to have
respect. We're not inspectors, but we make our own rules in
some situations because they never come out here and we always
have the same passengers. That's my own personal project. I
don't only have friends. Normally we should keep our mouths
shuts, avoid arguments and don't get into any disputes. (Driver)
Over and above these forms of individual resistance, the
drivers have various forms of collective recourse at their
disposal.
Voice: Use of the Legal Levers by Employees and
Their Representatives
Against this background, what courses of action are avail-
able in law and collective actions to drivers and their repre-
sentatives? If as we have seen, external quit is not frequent
(except for LittleBus), "internal quits" are used. But what
about the voice strategy?
Implementation of the right to leave one's post.When an
employee has reasonable grounds for thinking that a work
situation constitutes a clear and present danger to his life or
health or he observes that the protection system is defective,
he must alert the employer immediately and may leave his
post (article L. 4131-1 of the French Labour Code). It is
known that this right is regularly invoked by bus drivers in
the event of physical attacks on themselves or their col-
leagues. Such incidents are, incidentally, generally reported
in the media. Thus, all SouthBus drivers returned to the depot
during a brawl between inspectors and passengers a year
before we visited the company. Nevertheless, drivers in the
same company report that, if they are attacked, the radio link
is now cut and the other drivers are not informed of the inci-
dent: "before, when there was an attack, all the buses went
back to the depot. Now, since we're no longer informed of
attacks . . . the buses just keep going" (Driver).2 While the
right to leave one's post is more readily accepted when there
is a danger to physical health, its legitimacy in the case of
psychological danger is acknowledged in case law. However,
the only cases mentioned in our interviews followed physical
assaults.
The CHSCTs: Using all legal means of action.The CHSCTs'
remit and the fact that the social partners are equally repre-
sented on them make them the locus for social dialogue on
working and employment conditions. According to a mem-
ber of the CHSCT at SouthBus, "It's not a bargaining body,
we're there to work together and move things on." CHSCTs
seem, after all, to be perceived as a real partner on questions
of health and safety at work, on which a certain degree of
consensus is apparent. In fact, in both the companies in
which we were given access to a certain number of company
documents, the CHSCTs function properly and are active.
The interviews in the other companies reveal the same degree
of commitment. The quarterly meetings are held, annual
reports compiled, and surveys carried out. The smooth run-
ning of the committees is reflected in the establishment of
working groups to examine specific issues or the appoint-
ment of a member to carry out a specific task. Thus, the sin-
gle hazard risk assessment document was launched at
TramBus with the participation of CHSCT members and
working groups meet to examine the causes of workplace
accidents. On some issues, the groundwork can also be laid
with the company doctor or nurse (TramBus and
SouthBus).
In the view of some managers, this mode of operation is
more productive than plenary meetings mainly because the
individuals concerned feel more committed. Thus, at
SouthBus each of the elected members is allocated an area of
responsibility and has to report on progress every quarter to
the other members of the CHSCT. This co-construction is
particularly significant in this company, which has adopted a
fairly informal modus operandi. Thus, we discovered that an
agreement on the prevention of workplace hazards and health
and safety at work provides for the establishment of a com-
mittee for monitoring safety issues within the CHSCT (which
is responsible for determining its composition and the fre-
quency of its meetings). Now it emerges from the interviews
that, while the CHSCT is regularly informed and "consulted"
on working and employment conditions, it is not necessarily
this committee that is involved. Similarly, the annual reports
record that "only" six extraordinary meetings were held in 3
years, whereas some members of the CHSCT said they met
after each incident. The chair and secretary meet very regu-
larly (about once a month, or even more often) to discuss
health and safety issues or to make site visits although there
is not necessarily any written record of their discussions or
visits. In their view, this way of working enables them to
connect the information gathered with conditions on the
ground. Together, they familiarized themselves with the sin-
gle hazard risk assessment document, the arduous work
forms, and exposure to chemical hazards forms. However,
the CHSCT has never implemented the notification proce-
dure or ever asked for expert reports.
The CHSCTs also operate fairly systematically on their
own initiative with regard to all health and safety matters,
whether it be compliance with safety standards, the cleanli-
ness of company premises, the state of the public highways
or, of course, workplace accidents. This approach is usually
based on enquiries carried out by CHSCT members ("as
soon as something happens in the company, even at the
weekend, we're the first to be alerted . . . we immediately
send a standard letter and launch an enquiry . . ."), or even on
expert reports. This is notably what the CHSCT at TramBus
did when a new form of work organization was introduced
that changed the length of the working day. The employer
Louit-Martinod et al. 11
took the view that an expert report was not required and
referred the case to the courts. However, the case was dis-
missed, on the grounds that the proposal was complex and
that it altered the duties of many workers and the share of
subcontracting and hence the routes allocated to TramBus
employees and their shift start times. Finally, the expert
report commissioned by the CHSCT was used by the CHSCT
and the union to discuss and change some routes.
Besides these actions, the CHSCT at TramBus does not
hesitate to resort to law.After all, the co-construction approach
comes up against its limits when the company does not fulfill
itslegalobligationstoprotectitsemployees'health.According
to a member of the CHSCT, "first there's social dialogue, we
try to put something together, but if we're talking to someone
who doesn't want to speak with us or enter into dialogue, . . .
then it's legal action" (Secretary of CHSCT). Thus, co-con-
struction is abandoned in favor of protest, with the CHSCT
becoming one of the arenas in which conflict finds expression
and the initiator of numerous legal actions pursued with vigor
and described as "models" of trade union action by the major-
ity trade union. Several legal cases have been brought alleg-
ing obstruction of the CHSCT's work, notably because of a
lack of consultation before the introduction of a number of
changes to work organization. Thus, for example, when man-
agement hired outside consultants to analyze the circum-
stances surrounding accidents and other incidents and
established a psychological support system for employees
who had experienced or were living with work-related stress,
without having consulted the CHSCT, the CHSCT referred
the case to the courts. Its objective was to have the company
ordered to stop acting in this way, in particular because the
consultant in charge of providing psychological support was
allegedly "of debatable competence." This question of com-
petence was also a component of a conflict between the man-
agement and the occupational doctor (member of the CHSCT)
who was obliged later to quit the company. The judge found
that the CHSCT and the company medical department had
not been informed of these consultations. He ordered the
employer to suspend the consultant in charge of providing
psychological support, despite the fact that a significant num-
ber of workers were availing themselves of his services. In
our interviews with nurses, we heard some very contradictory
opinions of this consultant and the CHSCT initiative, which
was sometimes regarded as purely negative. However, in our
16 interviews of drivers, only one (a woman) quoted this fact,
with a clear reference to the lack of qualification of the con-
sultant as said by the CHSCT.
The trade unions: Negotiation on psycho-social risks still
inadequate. Besides taking legal action and offering advice
to employees, the trade unions obviously have a role to play
in terms of voice by negotiating at company level on matters
of health and safety at work, and more particularly on psy-
cho-social risks (Lerouge, 2010). Not everyone shares the
same vision of the approach to be adopted in preventing such
risks (Dedessus-Le-Moustier & Lerouge, 2011). In contrast
to other sectors, however, the adoption of a prevention policy
is a fairly long-standing issue in urban transport companies
because of the risk of physical aggression toward drivers.
Thus, such prevention policies have been the object of sev-
eral agreements in the companies investigated. However, the
agreements seldom take into account the psychological
aspect of the risks. The policies adopted still largely reflect
the standard "tertiary prevention" approach to health in the
workplace, in which the focus is more on mitigating the
effects through agreements that seek to reduce absence rates
(even when including specific measures on health and
safety), rather than on a "modern" policy of preventing risks,
particularly psycho-social risks. These agreements, which lie
somewhere between sanction and incentive, are not intended
to improve working conditions and hence health and safety
at work but rather to reduce absence rates. Thus, agreements
on profit sharing or career development include absences in
their methods of calculation. For example, the SouthBus
company agreement ties the overall level of profit sharing to
the reduction in absence rates (i.e., the fall in the number of
days' sick leave). This criterion, in conjunction with others
(number of tickets sold, quality of service), is supposed to
reflect the company's performance. The amount an individ-
ual employee actually receives is modified by his or her own
level of absence, with a deduction being applied pro rata for
each day of absence. Similarly, the TramBus career develop-
ment agreement states that "obtaining the increments [which
give rise to pay increases] is dependent on attendance
record." Interestingly, these agreements could lead to contra-
dictory behaviors, such as choosing not to declare illness or
stress, to keep the best premium.
Nevertheless, agreements on the prevention of occupa-
tional risks have been concluded. At TramBus, a 2002 agree-
ment includes a clause committing the management to
improve safety at work, particularly with regard to dealing
with the psychological consequences of attacks. In terms of
the chronology of the legal changes, this clause (which was
an annex to a wider agreement following a major strike about
pay and working time) could be said to be a "pioneering one"
(p. 10). However, 10 years afterward, with new interlocutors
and in a new context, we were unable to find any evidence of
what had been done. Furthermore, in 2010, although it had
not been possible to conclude an agreement, an action plan
on psycho-social risks was adopted in consultation with
workforce representatives and trade union delegates.
Similarly, an agreement concluded in 2011 at SouthBus sets
out the legal arrangements relating to the CHSCT, while pro-
viding for the establishment of a committee for monitoring
safety issues, the right to notification, the right to leave one's
post, and employee safety training and announcing the adop-
tion of a policy for preventing psycho-social risk and stress
at work. And even though the focus here is more on rectifica-
tion than prevention, mention should also be made of agree-
ments on physical incapacity.

Conclusion
Thus, despite a reduction in working time in France and an
indisputable improvement in the hardware, bus drivers are
still exposed to significant risks. Absences due to sickness
and accidents at work are on the rise. Corroborating indica-
tions of a deterioration in well-being have been recorded,
even though the majority of those we met also noted that
employment conditions and pay tended to be fairly good.
However, it is also known that in certain occupations, mostly
male-dominated and with a certain degree of professional
pride, there may be forms of denial or resistance in the face
of stress and psycho-social risks (Bouffartigue, Pendariès, &
Bouteiller, 2010; Loriol, 2005). For example, it is common in
the companies we investigated for employees to refuse assis-
tance from a psychologist.
Our results demonstrate how complex forms of work
intensification, not all of which are the sole responsibility of
the employing company, can be new risk factors. The cus-
tomer relationship, which in some cases has deteriorated, has
altered the nature of the job. Our results also highlight a
dimension that has received little attention in the literature,
namely, the relationship with other road users. Traffic jams
and inconsiderate behavior by other drivers are regarded as
all the more stressful as they are the product not of the ser-
vice relationship with the customer but of a job that entails
working in an open environment that is sometimes perceived
as becoming more and more difficult. This leads to a feeling
of powerlessness as this open environment is only very par-
tially within the employer's control.
Faced with deteriorating situations, the majority of driv-
ers find the means to adopt within themselves and in the
resources provided by their employer. Commitment to and
pride in the job remain, particularly because the pay and the
organization of working time are still attractive.
However, difficult situations still have to be faced,
whether individually or collectively. Some of these, as we
have seen, can be resolved by the exit response. This does
not usually involve quitting the company; rather, employees
seek to construct opportunities to change route or job or to
circumvent the rules when the conditions are no longer
bearable.
Others can be resolved through recourse to law or to the
employee representative bodies, a response more akin to
voice. This solution was commonly used in the large compa-
nies investigated, but less so in the smaller ones. French law
and institutions offer a fairly wide range of resources to sup-
port the expression of employee voice. However, attempts to
make use of these resources often come up against the vague-
ness of the notion of psycho-social risk and the lack of debate
on this issue.
The obligation placed on employers in France to achieve
certain results with regard to safety has led them to put in
place prevention policies. Employee representatives should,
therefore, concern themselves more with these questions, as
they will not thereby diminish the employer's responsibility.
Among these representative bodies, the CHSCTs should
focus more on the question of psycho-social risks, notably
through the single risk assessment document, which has been
little used to date in the companies investigated. This should
take the form, in particular, of more training on these issues
for CHSCT members. Nevertheless, it be should be noted
that at the time the present article was written, French
employers and trade unions were engaged in vigorous
debates on the employers' proposal that these bodies should
be abolished to make them a committee of the works council.
Similarly, the law stipulates that the works council must be
consulted on general problems relating to working and
employment conditions and can put forward proposals. It
should, therefore, also be a key actor in the prevention of
psycho-social risks. Finally, employee discussion sessions
could be introduced. After all, some drivers bemoaned the
lack of opportunities to discuss the difficult situations they
have experienced with their colleagues. These free expres-
sion sessions could be organized by the CHSCT or the works
council. This would also enable the CHSCT to meet more
employees as some CHSCT members did mention that one
of the difficulties inherent in the job was that they were
unable to see drivers as often as possible (in contrast to an
activity in which all the workforce is on-site).
Finally, employee training is often put forward as a key
issue (Baril-Gingras, Bellemare, & Brun, 2007). Although it
is provided and is appreciated in all the companies investi-
gated, it is sometimes perceived as a little artificial (simula-
tion of assaults, for example) and not grounded in the
feedback received from drivers and the opinions they voice.
This is, more broadly, a key question for many authors, about
psychological risks (Detchessahar, 2013) and the way by
which they could be discussed, said, and by this way more
precisely defined.
As far as future research is concerned, some key questions
could certainly be investigated in greater detail. The first,
from a comparative perspective, would be the various ways
in which different national forms of public procurement
affect the relationship between transport firms, the local
authority, and workers. The consequences for working con-
ditions will probably be different, depending on whether the
subcontracting affects a single route or an entire network. A
second focus for further research would be to produce quan-
titative indicators of the new forms of intensification that we
have pinpointed through qualitative case studies. Last but not
least, it would be of interest to have more longitudinal data
on bus drivers'careers to understand what they had done pre-
viously and what exit or voice solutions they adopted during
their working lives.

Notes
1. Obviously we also have many cases of loyalty that are not
mentioned in the article, which focuses on the most difficult
situations and forms of resistance.
2. It should be noted that the final Court of Appeal in France
(Cour de Cassation) decided that only drivers on the route on
which an assault has taken place may exercise their right to
withdraw if there is no clear and present danger on the other
routes (Employees v. Sté STAC, Cour de cassation, April 23,
2003, n° 01-44806).
