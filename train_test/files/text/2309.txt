Objective. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are recommended for virtually all patients with rheuma-
toid arthritis (RA). We investigated the use of DMARDs in patients with RA in a nationally representative sample of visits
to US physicians in the National Ambulatory Care Medical Survey (NAMCS).
Methods. We analyzed the NAMCS visit data from 1996 through 2007 if the physician noted a diagnosis of RA. DMARD
utilization was based on the medications listed by the physician. We used generalized linear models to examine the
adjusted associations between DMARD use and potential predictors.
Results. Of the 859 visits with a diagnosis code of RA identified over the study period, 404 visits (47%; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI] 44­50%) had an associated DMARD. The percentage of RA visits with DMARDs increased slightly over
the 12 years (P  0.048), with biologic DMARDs increasing to 20% of visits after their introduction (P for trend <0.001).
In fully adjusted models, African American race was associated with a 30% reduction in DMARD prescribing (risk ratio
[RR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.48­1.00). A visit to a rheumatologist was the strongest correlate of DMARD prescribing (RR 2.33, 95%
CI 1.89­2.86). Among visits to nonrheumatologists, African Americans were significantly less likely than whites to receive
a DMARD (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17­0.92), but not among visits with rheumatologists (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52­1.27).
Conclusion. In the NAMCS, most visits coded with RA did not have an associated DMARD prescription. African
Americans were less likely to receive DMARDs than whites, particularly when visiting nonrheumatologists.
INTRODUCTION
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune in-
flammatory arthritis associated with pain, disability, and
increased mortality. Disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs (DMARDs) represent the standard of care for RA,
with demonstrated ability to reduce pain and disability
(1). Whereas the traditional model of RA treatment had
been a "pyramid" approach, beginning with nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids for
the first phase of treatment, the recommended strategy
now includes immediate DMARD therapy (1). These agents
are recommended by the major rheumatologic societies,
and in rheumatic disease specialty practices more than
90% of patients with RA received DMARDs (1­3). This
approach has been widely embraced. In fact, US national
care quality organizations have included DMARD treat-
ment for RA as a performance standard (4).
Since the 1990s, DMARD options have proliferated with
increased numbers of both synthetic small molecules and
biologic treatments, e.g., tumor necrosis factor inhibitors,
B cell depleting therapy, a costimulatory agonist, and an
interleukin-6 antagonist (5). Despite the increased number
of DMARD options and the agreement on their importance
in RA, several studies suggest that many patients do not
receive these therapies. A study using Medicare data from
2 US states from 1996­2004 showed that 30% of benefi-
ciaries with RA filled a DMARD prescription during the 12
months after cohort entry (6). Data from British Columbia

during 1996­2000 found only 43% of RA patients re-
ceived DMARD treatment during 60 months of followup
(7). Furthermore, a very recent study using data from
Medicare Managed Care plans found that 59% of benefi-
ciaries with RA used a DMARD in 2005 and 67% in 2008
(8). These studies suggest that there may be widespread
underuse of DMARDs for RA, yet the reasons remain un-
clear. Prior studies identified older age, depression, and
lack of a rheumatology visit as correlates of not using a
DMARD (6­8), suggesting potential disparities in DMARD
use. However, these studies covered a short duration and
focused on a relatively narrow range of patients, mostly
older Medicare beneficiaries.
To overcome these limitations, we examined DMARD
use for RA using nationally representative data on office
visits with physicians from the National Ambulatory Med-
ical Care Survey (NAMCS) (9). Based on previous studies
from other therapeutic areas suggesting that the receipt of
specific interventions often differs by race (10­13), we
examined the effect of race, ethnicity, and physician spe-
cialty on DMARD prescribing. The effects of race and
ethnicity were first analyzed in the whole cohort. To ex-
amine whether access to rheumatology care modified a
possible race and ethnicity effect, we also analyzed this
relationship in samples stratified on whether the visit was
with a rheumatologist.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study sample. We studied data from the NAMCS, an
annual visit-based cross-sectional survey conducted in
physicians' offices. The NAMCS includes a nationally rep-
resentative probability sample of ambulatory physician
practices across the US using a multistage cluster strategy,
selecting physicians by geographic location and provider
specialty. Physicians and their office staff are trained to
complete the survey for all visits in a randomly sampled
week. The purposeful sampling strategy and use of
weights allows one to generalize to the 650 million office
visits made annually to physicians in the US. Physicians
and patients are not sampled repetitively across years.
Our study sample consisted of all visits recorded in the
NAMCS for 1996­2007 with a diagnosis of RA listed
among any of the diagnoses on the visit survey form. The
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Partners Healthcare System.
RA treatment. Up to 8 new or ongoing medications and
up to 3 diagnoses were recorded for each visit in the
NAMCS. The primary outcome for these analyses was
DMARD prescribing as recorded on the visit survey form.
We included nonbiologic DMARDs (azathioprine, cyclo-
sporine, D-penicillamine, gold preparations, hydroxychlo-
roquine, leflunomide, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine)
and biologic DMARDs (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra,
etanercept, infliximab, and rituximab). A variable on the
survey indicates whether the prescription is new or a
continuation. Prescriptions for oral glucocorticoids, opi-
oids, and NSAIDs (nonselective and selective) were also
assessed.
Potential correlates of DMARD prescribing. The NAMCS
visit data include a limited set of variables possibly related
to DMARD prescribing. These include: 1) sociodemo-
graphic variables concerning the presenting patient, such
as age, sex, race (white, African American, and other),
ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic, and unknown), health
insurance coverage, and region of residence, 2) the number
of non-DMARD drugs prescribed, and 3) the type of pro-
vider who conducted the visit. We categorized the types of
providers as rheumatologists or nonrheumatologists.
Statistical analyses. We assessed the percentage of RA
visits associated with a DMARD prescription for each of
the 12 study years. The variables were compared across
visits with and without DMARDs, and then risk ratios
(RRs) were estimated using generalized linear models ac-
counting for the clustered nature of the visits and sampling
weights. The unit of analysis is the visit coded for RA
and not persons with RA; RA cases are not followed lon-
gitudinally over 12 years since different RA individuals
are sampled every year. The variables associated with
DMARD use were examined in a series of models with an
increasing number of covariates, testing whether the effect
of race and/or ethnicity was diminished with increasing
adjustment. Region of residence and health insurance sta-
tus were not significant predictors in univariate or multi-
variate models and were removed from analyses. We
added the rheumatologist covariate as the last variable to
determine whether the effect of race and ethnicity was
mediated by access to rheumatology care. Based on initial
results, we further examined whether the effect of race and
ethnicity were modified by rheumatology care by compar-
ing RRs in 2 sets of adjusted models, i.e., 1 for visits to
rheumatologists and 1 for visits to nonrheumatologists. We
also assessed the interaction effect of race and ethnicity by
rheumatology care. We used SUDAAN statistical software,
version 10.0.1 (Research Triangle Institute) to account for
the complex survey design.
RESULTS
We identified 859 visits with a diagnosis of RA over the
12-year study period. When weighted to the US popula-
Significance & Innovations
 In a large US national survey of office visits to
physicians, 47% of visits with a diagnosis of rheu-
matoid arthritis were associated with a disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).
 In fully adjusted models, African American race
was associated with a 30% reduction in DMARD
prescribing and a visit to a rheumatologist was the
strongest correlate of DMARD prescribing, more
than doubling the likelihood of receiving a
DMARD.

tion, this total represents 3.7 million visits over this
period that included a diagnosis of RA. Characteristics of
these 859 visits are described in Table 1. The majority of
patients were age 45 years and 76% were women. Most
patients were white and non-Hispanic. None were preg-
nant or had human immunodeficiency virus, both of
which are potential contraindications to the use of certain
DMARDs.
Of the 859 visits associated with RA, 378 (44%) were
associated with 3 non-DMARD drugs, 315 (37%) with 1
or 2, and 166 (19%) with none. Approximately half of the
visits were to a rheumatologist, with DMARD users much
more likely to see a rheumatologist than nonusers.
Of these 859 visits, 404 (47%; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI] 44­50%) were associated with a prescription for
a DMARD, representing 1.9 million visits in the US. The
remaining 455 visits without an associated DMARD repre-
sent 1.8 million visits in the US. The percentage of visits
with a DMARD prescription increased slightly over the
study period (Figure 1). The percentage with a biologic
DMARD gradually increased since they were introduced
in 1999. In 2007, there were 293,000 visits in the US
associated with a DMARD and 110,000 were with a bio-
logic DMARD. Of the 455 visits without an associated
DMARD, 16 (3.5%) had 8 medications listed on their
NAMCS form (the maximum permitted) and 83 (1.2%)
used oral glucocorticoids.
We examined the correlates of any DMARD and biologic

There is only a solid circle at the first time period (1996­1998)
because all DMARDs were nonbiologic. Over the period studied,
there was a slight increase in any DMARD use (P for trend

trend 0.001).

DMARD use in a series of multivariable models (Table 2).
In model 1, which includes the calendar year of the visit,
race, and ethnicity, African American race was associated
with a trend toward a reduced RR of any DMARD use
(RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42­1.12). In models 2 and 3, the effect
of African American race was maintained and was statis-
tically significant with increasing adjustment. The effect
of race on the use of biologic DMARDs was qualitatively
similar to any DMARD use, but it was not statistically
significant (Table 2). Furthermore, African American race
was not significantly associated with a lower risk of any
DMARD use (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52­1.27) in a fully ad-
justed model restricted to the 377 visits made to rheuma-
tologists. When the same adjusted model was run for the
482 visits to nonrheumatologists, African American race
had a stronger association with any DMARD nonuse (RR
0.39, 95% CI 0.17­0.92) than among visits to rheumatolo-
gists (Table 3); however, the P value for interaction was
0.15.
Trends in the use of other drugs commonly used to
manage pain and inflammation were also examined in the
same 859 NAMCS visits (Figure 2). During the 12 years of
NAMCS data studied, we found that 4­11% of the visits
listed an opioid with an approximate doubling of use in
recent years. Oral glucocorticoids and NSAIDs/coxibs
were each used by one-quarter to one-third of subjects
with RA without any clear time trends.
DISCUSSION
The early and aggressive use of DMARDs has improved the
care and outcomes of RA (14,15). However, several studies
suggest that the potential benefits of DMARDs are not
being reaped by many people experiencing RA because of
underuse of these agents (6­8). To guide strategies to
improve DMARD use, a better understanding of this prob-
lem and its determinants is required. We examined data
from a US national survey conducted over a 12-year time
period and investigated whether race and/or ethnicity dis-
parities exist in DMARD utilization.
Over the study period, we found that fewer than half of
RA visits listed a DMARD and the DMARD treatment rates
improved only slightly over the 12-year study period. This
was surprising as a substantial increase has been noted in
several other studies (6,8). It is unclear whether the rela-
tively small increase that we observed in comparison to
other studies was due to differences in the population or
was related to how DMARD use was measured. African
American race was a significant correlate of DMARD non-
use, with African Americans having a 30% reduced utili-
zation of any DMARD compared to whites; similar trends
were observed for biologic DMARDs. African American
race was noted to be a correlate of DMARD nonuse in
another US study among Medicare beneficiaries (6). As
well, African American race has been found to be corre-
lated with less frequent use of many health services, in-

Association of Race and Ethnicity With DMARD Prescribing 187
cluding total joint replacement, cardiac revascularization,
and organ transplant (11,13,16,17). Potential reasons for
such treatment disparities include differences in access to
care, attitudes and preferences of providers and patients,
and differences in clinical presentation across different
patient groups (18).
It is noteworthy that in the entire sample of visits, the
effect of African American race was attenuated when the
rheumatologist indicator was added to the model. This
suggests that lack of access to a rheumatologist may be one
mediator of the racial disparity. There was also evidence
that the effect of African American race was modified by
whether or not the visit was to a rheumatologist (Table 3).
Health insurance status was not significantly associated
with use of DMARDs.
While seeing a rheumatologist was strongly associated
with DMARD use for all racial and ethnic groups, most
persons with RA are not seen by rheumatologists in the US
or abroad (6,7,19,20). Our data demonstrate that DMARD
use has increased slightly over a period of time despite
the following: 1) at least 5 new DMARDs were introduced,
2) scientific data clarified the important role of DMARDs
(15), and 3) DMARDs for RA became a quality measure for
health plans in the US. The lack of prescribing improve-
ment speaks to the slow pace with which medical practice
catches up to clinical evidence, i.e., 17 years as estimated
by the Institute of Medicine (21).
This study has important limitations, mostly associated
with the NAMCS. The NAMCS does not allow one to
confirm diagnoses. Therefore, it is impossible to know the
accuracy of the RA code. Based on the calculated national
estimates compared with other data sources, it is likely
that some visits coded with RA are inaccurate (22). Typi-
cally, this type of misclassification biases toward the null,
making it more difficult to observe the effect of other
variables, such as African American race. Moreover, the
medication lists are not validated against prescription
data, but prior work suggests that NAMCS data are accept-
ably accurate (23). The scope of the NAMCS is a great
strength of this study. The purposeful sampling strategy
used by the NAMCS, including urban and rural areas and
patients of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, allows
one to generalize to the entire US. As well, we studied a
relatively large group of visits sampled over a long period.
Prior studies are typically restricted to specific patient
groups or narrow geographic regions, while the NAMCS
represents a national sample. However, the NAMCS does
not include information about several sociodemographic
variables of interest, including household income and ed-
ucation level. Health insurance status was not associated
with DMARD use in these data, but future studies should
also determine whether African American race is a surro-
gate for socioeconomic issues and/or limited access. While
these variables may underlie some of the differences in
DMARD treatment that we observed, the models presented
herein point toward race as being an important patient
characteristic that may serve as a useful target for further
epidemiologic studies and interventions.
In conclusion, we studied 12 years of data from a na-
tionally representative sample of ambulatory visits in the
US. Among the visits identified with a diagnosis of RA,
only 47% were associated with a DMARD. DMARDs were
prescribed much less often for African Americans than for
whites, especially among visits to nonrheumatologists.
This finding suggests that part of the reason that African

American race may be associated with reduced DMARD
use is that African Americans have more limited access to
rheumatologists. Interventions should be considered to
improve DMARD prescribing, focusing particularly on pa-
tients who do not see rheumatologists and on African
American patients who appear to have less access to rheu-
matologists. Health insurance status was not significantly
associated with DMARD use in these data, but future stud-
ies should also determine whether African American race
is a surrogate for socioeconomic issues and/or limited
access. Expanding access to DMARDs will likely require
improving collaborative care between generalists and spe-
cialists, as well as learning more about patients' prefer-
ences and how they weigh the potential benefits and risks
of these agents.
