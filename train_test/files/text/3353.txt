Introduction
There are several difficulties that impinge on the collection
of reliable statistics on criminal activity and victimization in
Nigeria (Alemika, 2004). The inability of market women to
play a significant role in Oyo's accusatory justice constitutes
one of these difficulties. Being a multi-faceted social chal-
lenge, crime has no easy fix, anywhere in the world.
Nevertheless, crime reporting is one of the most effective
responses by which members of civilized societies provide
solutions to crime issues.
The history of crime and its reporting by women in con-
temporary Nigeria have focused essentially on the interac-
tions that occur among the victim, criminal justice system,
and the offender. In the quest to discover a great deal about
how certain crimes are and are not reported, the network of
social intervention, gender structure of crime reporters, the
twin spectacles of the apprehension and escape of offenders
have stimulated this inquiry. It was almost invariably these
individuals who decided whether a crime was to be prose-
cuted in the first instance, and it was their words which were
recorded by magistrates during trials.
Despite small businesses serving as major income earners
and new employment providers for Oyo's teeming youth,
overcoming business crimes that threaten the contribution of
market women to the economic development of this ancient
community is probably its most critical challenge. Although
business and retail crimes are commonly assumed to include
all crimes and disorder committed by or against businesses,
the onslaught on them has lately become an issue of signifi-
cant interest to individuals who monitor developments within
the Nigerian economy with patriotic interest.
If current statistics, which paint the exact picture of vic-
timization of women within the economy were available,
these would have revealed how acutely deprived women
traders have been in Nigeria. While substantial research has
been conducted in relation to crimes against individuals,
research into crimes against businesses has traditionally
received less attention, although this gap has started to close
in recent years (Burrows, Anderson, Bamfield, Hopkins, &
Ingram, 1999; Felson & Clarke, 1997; Gill, 1998; Hopkins,

Crime-Reporting Practices Among
Market Women in Oyo, Nigeria
Johnson Oluwole Ayodele1
Abstract
Crime surveys of businesses have revealed that while crimes in which men were victims tend to be reported, those in which
women were victims are likely to go unreported to the police. Understanding the reasons behind male reporting and female
non-reporting is useful not only for collection of crime statistics but also for improving crime control competences of law
enforcement agencies. This article examines the impact of crime involving market women on their crime-reporting practices
in Oyo town, Oyo State, Nigeria. The study adopted quantitative and qualitative approaches. Copies of a questionnaire
were administered to collect quantitative data from randomly selected 210 market women at Akesan, Sabo, and Mosadoba
markets in Oyo town. Five focus group discussions, in-depth and key informant interviews were conducted to complement
quantitative data. Both data were analyzed. The study found that cultural considerations stand between crime events that
hurt the economic interests of women and their readiness to report to the police. Due to the very low confidence that
market women have in the ability and willingness of the police to apprehend criminals, they prefer to internalize their losses,
take their cases to traditional rulers who use "oro cult" to protect them against criminals, or approach available faith-based
options such as churches and mosques. The article concludes that women have economy-enriching roles to play in the
context of sustainable security. It therefore suggests that the government should address public safety to enable market
women make their modest contribution to Nigeria's economic development.

2002; Mirrlees-Black & Ross, 1995a, 1995b; Tilley &
Hopkins, 1998; Walker, 1994) in advanced countries per-
haps, but not so appreciably in most developing countries of
the world, especially in Nigeria.
Thus, providing inadequate empirical evidence to confirm
the assumption that crime against businesses is almost as
twice the estimated number of crimes against households. It
is regrettable that among the general public, a commonly
held perception is that, as transgressions against inanimate
objects, business crimes are obscure, "victimless" events.
Business victims consequently generally fail to arouse the
sort of empathetic responses ordinarily reserved for "real"
victims--individuals--as they are seen as better able to
manage the event and absorb the losses (Johnston, Leitner,
Shapland, & Wiles, 1994). Although business crime has
often been regarded as a victimless crime due to difficulties
in quantifying its nature, scale, and impact (Robson &
Teague, 2005), the potential costs of business crime to both
the individual business and the wider community are now
better documented (N. Taylor, 2002), even if business
offenses still mostly go unreported.
One of the most basic aspects of civil society is the guar-
antee of citizens' safety and liberty to undertake decent
engagements, including ones with economic motivation
without any form of harassment. However, protecting the
rights of individuals, who transact their businesses legiti-
mately at market places has remained a challenge in many
developed and developing countries of the world. When the
means of a people's livelihood is threatened, economic hopes
become shattered. Apart from the absence of employment
opportunities for able-bodied youth that makes vandalism a
perennial problem, some people see their reckless siege on
market traders as "no more than youthful high spirits or as an
unconscious attempt on the part of children to exercise con-
trol over their environment by leaving some sign of their
presence" (Barker & Bridgeman, 1994, p. 4).
Could youth not constitute an army of informal commu-
nity security outfit, which imposes service charges on clients
as a more socioeconomically responsible means of establish-
ing their presence? The wanton activities of badly behaved
youth could result in a situation that causes mass panic and
insecurity to flourish. This could affect the welfare of poor
and rich people in the community. It can cause injury and
death, reduce family income, and generate a climate of fear
(Department for International Development [DFID], 2000).
Although some Nigerian laws exist to guarantee freedom of
lawful competition, security of assets, and the protection of
the business people's rights of ownership, nevertheless, con-
flict scholars present the theoretical argument that crimes
serve as a sort of non-institutionalized protest against the
existing social relationships as well as a reaction to those
relationships. Therefore, criminals who victimize market
women respond to failures in social consciousness and in
legislation intended to redistribute property and social status
among various social groups (Tulyakov, 2004).
Studies conducted in the area of business crime provide
support to the thesis that a substantial proportion of busi-
nesses suffer from crime. By virtue of their sizes and income
they bring about, small businesses lack the human and finan-
cial resources of larger businesses to implement crime pre-
vention measures. Often, surveys report that approximately
half of the businesses surveyed had experienced a crime
(Burrows et al., 1999; Gill, 1998; Perrone, 2000). Sometimes,
this figure can be even larger (up to 76%), as was found in
another study (Wood, Wheelwright, & Burrows, 1997).
Unfortunately, market women do not report crimes to the
police.
The British Chamber of Commerce (2004) reports that the
main reasons for businesses not reporting crime were the
relatively small or no loss/damage to the premises or prop-
erty, no confidence in the police response, and too time-con-
suming. In addition, FSB (2005) indicates that businesses are
particularly reluctant to report minor crimes as well as crimes
that occur infrequently. The reluctance of business people to
report crimes does not translate into crime prevention; nei-
ther does it cause them to be immune to revictimization.
What it does imply is a conspiracy of silence that rubs public
record of due statistics for crime monitoring, community sur-
veillance, and resource allocation policies.
Besides, the limitations of official police recorded crime
statistics are well known in that they only indicate the nature
and level of crime that is reported to the police (Carcach &
Makkai, 2002). It is even more difficult to accurately deter-
mine the true nature and extent of business crime because it
is often left unreported (N. Taylor, 2002).
Again, the reasons why business crime is underreported
are manifold but such underreporting means that police
crime statistics do not reveal the true extent of the problem.
Most business people, who refuse to report crime incidents
involving them, are probably ignorant of the fact that their
attitude affects the ability of the police to target and tackle
the problem effectively (FSB, 2005; N. Taylor, 2002), and
the effectiveness of any data collection mechanism is inti-
mately connected with the preparedness of victims to report
the crimes to which they have been subjected (West, 2000).
In the face of negative crime-reporting practices of busi-
ness people, small businesses are concerned that the impact
and seriousness of crime against businesses are overlooked
by the criminal justice system with an overwhelming number
of business owners stating that current deterrents are not suf-
ficient to protect small businesses from the threat of criminal
activity (FSB, 2005). In traditional African settings, most
markets are places either open or covered, where individuals,
irrespective of their ethnic nationalities, who have wares to
offer for sale, meet and agree with their prospective custom-
ers, usually after non-mandatory negotiating interactions, to
exchange goods for money.
For the peculiar nature of policing in Nigeria, market
women do not need to be convinced that the Nigeria police
are, even if illegitimately, too preoccupied with maintaining
Ayodele 3
the peace in other public spaces, in which the presence of
wealthy government officials and politicians is more perva-
sive, particularly to protect from harm than embark on less
rewarding market patrols. Customarily, therefore, market
women are accustomed to engaging members of vigilante
groups to secure their wares. In this particular circumstance,
these traders probably took the safety of their wares in the
market for granted. As a result, they did not arrange private
security and paid dearly for that negligence.
The effects of crime on market women's businesses can be
devastating for the wider community in the following regard:
It often subjects women traders to repeat victimization and
disruptive turnover; crime affects their ability to meet their
customers' deadlines, attract new customers, and ultimately
cause them to face the risk of businesses closing down and
putting local patronage at risk. Business crimes affect profit-
ability; deter investment and scarce financial resources are
drained partly through crime prevention measures.
On the whole, crime is a drain on the economy, inhibiting
progress and damaging competitiveness. It imposes direct
and indirect costs on the business, and it is often the impact
of crime, rather than the direct cost, which is most devastat-
ing (Robson & Teague, 2005). The businesses of market
women are usually done on a small scale. This makes their
enterprises particularly vulnerable to collapse, as they lack a
competitive market edge, and hence experience greater dif-
ficulty in absorbing the costs of victimization (Fisher &
Looye, 2000; Snyder, Broome, & Zimmerman, 1989). It is
for these reasons that market women whose businesses fall
victim to crime are often left to bear the cost alone or in con-
junction with their friends and family members.
Despite the likelihood of women seeming too naturally
scared about crime, it is alarming that studies have found out
that even businesses are somewhat resigned to the experi-
ence of crime. A BCC (1997) survey discovered that 85% of
respondents were reconciled to accepting victimization as a
fact of entrepreneurial life--a natural cost of doing business.
Allegations of a "grudging acceptance [by retailers] that theft
is a fact of [business] life" have also been noted in Australia
(Hagopian, 1999-2000, p. 16).
At this juncture, the consistent finding that commercial
premises face a greater risk of criminal victimization and
revictimization than their residential counterparts (Bamfield,
1994; Bowers, Hirschfield, & Johnson, 1998; Naudé,
Prinsloo, & Martins, 1999; G. Taylor, 1999; van Dijk
&Terlouw, 1996) is of particular relevance, especially to
small business enterprises, where multiple or chronic victim-
ization is common (BCC, 1997; Hibberd & Shapland, 1993;
Mirrlees-Black & Ross, 1995a, 1995b; Perrone, 2000; Tilley
& Hopkins, 1998). All these make the lack of interest in
reporting of business offenses by market women seem
normative.
Beyond that, the commercial strength of market women
has not attained the level at which they can, without being
prodded, insure their wares for the purposes of risk
management; it is high time these traders appreciated the
broader context of doing businesses that must succeed. There
is hardly a way the environment and its components, which
sometimes have counterproductive impact on business activ-
ities will not, in some subtle ways, frustrate the crime-report-
ing initiatives of market women. In reality, the boundaries
between the business and public domains are far from dis-
crete, and hence, the effects of crime against businesses
reverberate throughout the society (Cromie, 1993; Fisher,
1991; Fisher & Looye, 2000).
The organized and unorganized private sectors of the
Nigerian economy, for example, contribute significantly to
situations that threaten the well-being of businesses, even if
they facilitate domestic capital investment, employment
growth, gross domestic product, and economic well-being of
the country, in general. Therefore, any assault on the busi-
ness sector is, therefore, an assault on business strength, eco-
nomic vigor, and social well-being of all Nigerians. It is the
realization of this that makes an inquiry into crime-reporting
practices of market women irresistible, at this time.
Social Action of Marx Weber was used as the theoretical
framework of this study. His school of thought holds sociol-
ogy as a comprehensive science of the subjective meanings
of the understandable motives of human actors. These sub-
jective meanings are attached to human actions in their
mutual orientations within specific sociocultural contexts.
Therefore, any behavior outside of this web, as Weber insists,
falls outside the purview of sociology. It is probably in this
context that Secher (1962) credited Weber with the belief
that an action is "social," if the acting individual takes
account of the behavior of others and is thereby oriented in
its course.
In the context of crime against market women and their
reporting practices, the emphasis of this theory is on how
shared values encourage or frustrate individual action in
respect of how or how not to respond to issues of business
victimization. This theory tries to explain how actors and
society interact in the aftermath of crime. Market women
victims just do not base their crime-reporting decision mak-
ing on the contextual issues only, they often look beyond,
especially at the broader interactional implications of their
crime control initiatives for gainful future integration in the
cultural milieu. Surprisingly, business crime has received
relatively little attention from the U.K. government and
criminologists despite the fact that it can have a significant
impact on businesses (FSB, 2005; Hopkins, 2002). Crime
prevention efforts have similarly focused on households and
individuals, because they are the victims of a higher propor-
tion of crimes than businesses (Burrows & Hopkins, 2005).
While interest in business victimization has increased in
recent years, research in this domain is still limited and more
work has been done in countries other than Australia (Fisher
& Looye, 2000; Gill, 1998; Mirrlees-Black & Ross, 1995a;
Tilley & Hopkins, 1998) and Nigeria. It is against this back-
drop that this study aims to contribute to the knowledge base
4 SAGE Open
of crimes against women's businesses through the involve-
ment of the criminal justice system, in Oyo town, Nigeria, by
providing answers to the following questions:
Research Question 1: What is the nature of crime com-
monly committed against market women in Oyo town?
Research Question 2: How do the women victims handle
the reporting of crimes committed against their
businesses?
Research Question 3: How satisfied are these market
women victims with the outcomes of the reports of their
victimization?
Materials and Method
The study location was Oyo town in Oyo state (Figure 1).
Oyo is mostly inhabited by the Yoruba people. The popula-
tion for this study comprises residents, especially female
Figure 1. The study site in Nigeria.

capital city is Port-Harcourt, in the south are the main business districts.

traders aged 18 years and above, that is, young and old
female traders who are resident in Oyo town where their
experiences of crime incidents make them prone to reporting
crime in the way they do. The study randomly selected 225
women traders at Akesan, Sabo, and Mosadoba markets in
Oyo town, as respondents to copies of a questionnaire.
The questionnaire was crafted in English but was trans-
lated to Yoruba for respondents who did not understand
English. The research assistant filled out the questionnaire
after the respondents had answered the questions. Even those
of the respondents who could write, judging by their power
of expression, were not inclined to do so because of the
infringement of doing so on their sales' time. The three mar-
kets were randomly selected. As observation later revealed,
the population of traders in the three markets, the number of
their customers, and the level of socioeconomic activities
going on there, showed that they have the requirements to
serve as representative samples of others.
In addition, these markets are located at different geo-
graphical areas of Oyo town with diversity in socioeconomic
and cultural characteristics. These make selected respondents
from the markets quite representative and therefore suitable
for the study. Also, five focus group discussions (FGDs) were
conducted to capture the underlying thoughts that inform
market women's crime-reporting practices, their sociodemo-
graphic characteristics and suggestions for improving their
crime-reporting responses, so as to guarantee safer commer-
cial interactions and livelihoods in Oyo markets.
This study adopted the probability and non-probability
sample procedures. Therefore, random sampling and purpo-
sive sampling methods were used in selecting study sites and
respondents. FGD respondents were selected through purpo-
sive sampling (opinion leaders such as market women lead-
ers, police officers, customers, and members of civil rights
fighters).
Concepts and Measurements
The dependent variables used for the study are whether mar-
ket women reported their victimization experiences prior to
the survey. The independent variables are age, place of trad-
ing, marital status, educational level, occupation, religion,
and volume of trade. For knowledge about crime prevention,
respondents who mentioned more than three ways of pre-
venting victimization were classified as having good or high
knowledge about prevention. From the causes of crime
against market women, only three of those options are cor-
rect, those who mentioned any of the options were regarded
as having good knowledge about the causes, whereas others
were categorized as having poor knowledge of the causes of
victimization in this article.
Sampling Design and Selection
Furthermore, these markets are heterogeneous enough to
contain the diversity in sociocultural, political, and economic
characteristics required for representativeness in the study.
These make respondents quite suitable for the study. The
sample size for this study was 225 female respondents (18
years and above) in Oyo town to study their crime-reporting
practices and the efficacy of such practices in containing
business victimization in Oyo town. For the reason that bor-
ders on education policy in Nigeria, it is a crime for a school-
age child to be engaged in commercial activities during
school hours. As a result, the study did not envisage finding
school-age children selling in open markets, where they
could be easily located by government officials who might
arrest them for engaging in illegality.
Also, five FGDs were conducted. The sociodemographic
characteristics of respondents make them appropriate for the
provision of suggestions that could help strengthen security
consciousness and make Oyo market women operate their
businesses in a safer Oyo community. This study adopted the
probabilityandnon-probabilitysampleprocedures.Therefore,
random sampling and purposive sampling methods were
used. Key informant interview respondents were selected
through purposive sampling (opinion leaders such as market
leaders, key community leaders such as the head of the vigi-
lante group, a chief, and a police officer).
Data Collection
Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data
gathering. While the questionnaire method was used to fetch
quantitative data, FGD provided complementary qualitative
data for the study. Five final-year students of Sociology
Department of the Lagos State University, comprising three
men and two ladies, were engaged as assistants who con-
ducted the FGDs and administered copies of the question-
naire with the researcher. The research assistants primarily
used Yoruba language in translating the questions to Yoruba
respondents and Pidgin English (commonly called broken
English, which is understood across Nigeria as the simplest
mode of informal communication) to translate to other
respondents from other ethnic groups. In the FGD, the Pidgin
English was mainly used.
These assistants were rigorously trained on the techniques
of interviewing people in ways that will prevent respondents
from holding any vital information back or injecting their
personal biases. Pre-interview practice sessions were held to
avail the research assistants the skill to administer question-
naire, handle tape recorders, and transcribe their contents.
These orientation exercises took 5 days. In all, 210 copies of
a questionnaire were administered, retrieved, correctly com-
pleted, and analyzed for the study.
Sample selection
Quantitative.To make the sample size representative
of the entire population of market traders in Oyo town in
the study area, three markets were randomly picked from
among the markets in the town. From each of the three mar-
kets, 70 respondents were randomly selected to respond to
6 SAGE Open
copies of a questionnaire. In all, 210 copies of a question-
naire were correctly completed and analyzed for the study.
From these responses, information about respondents'
sociodemographic characteristics and crime-reporting
practices were captured.
Qualitative. Five FGDs were conducted to elicit informa-
tion about crime-reporting responses of market women in
Oyo town to capture the underlying thoughts that keep the
observed crime-reporting practices enduring in contempo-
rary times. The focus group discussants were selected across
different socioeconomic backgrounds within the study area.
Each of the FGDs consisted of eight participants. Consent
forms were administered to all the participants before the
discussions. Tapes, notes, and consent forms were safely
kept by the researcher.
Data Analysis
Quantitative data. Returned copies of a completed question-
naire were thoroughly edited. Being a pre-coded instrument,
entry and analyses were facilitated. The quantitative data
collected from this survey were subjected to three levels of
analysis. The first level involves an examination of the distri-
bution of the respondents according to selected characteris-
tics. This is because the behavior of individuals in society is,
to a large extent, determined by their personal characteristics
as well as those of the environment in which they live.
For this reason, it is expected that crime-reporting
responses will be greatly determined by background charac-
teristics such as education, age, marital status, and type of
trade invested in. To this end, simple percentages were used
to describe these variables. The second level involves the
examination of the pattern of relationship between the inde-
pendent variable, that is, market women and other dependent
variables such as crime-reporting practices.
Qualitative data. The discussions from the FGDs were tran-
scribed and translated verbatim. Analysis involved develop-
ing a system of indexing the data into sets of categories or
codes that provided structure to the data based on the research
objectives and the topic included in the question guide. A
qualitative software ZY-index software package for ethno-
graphic data was used for textual data analysis. Some strik-
ing expressions were used for verbatim reporting. Data from
qualitative survey have been extensively used in this article
to validate quantitative analysis where and when desirable.
Results
Socioeconomic Characteristics
About 88.5% of respondents who admitted having been vic-
tims of crimes are between ages 26 and 40 years holding
West African School Certificate (37.8%), First School
Leaving Certificate (36.7%), National Certificate of
Education (19.4%), and First University Degree (6.1%).
From the foregoing, respondents cannot be assumed to be
ignorant traders, who are completely oblivious of the impli-
cations of the dynamics of crime reporting. Their culture
may simply be overwhelming.
The marital status of respondents, who have fallen vic-
tims of crimes, is as follows: married (71.2%), divorced
(11.5%), and widowed (17.3%). Also, of the respondents,
24% who are Christians admitted that they have been victims
of crime and 26.1% that they are not. However, 70% of the
respondents who are Muslims said that they have been vic-
tims of crime, whereas 67.4% said that they have never been
victims of crime. It was not as if, in reality, they were not
victimized but being victims of crime, especially in a tradi-
tional environment, is interpreted to be a kind of punishment
for concealed sins. Victimhood, therefore, attracts lots of ste-
reotypes and stigmatization. This explains why most tradi-
tional individuals want to avoid being classified as victims,
at all costs.
Of the respondents surveyed, 39.7% who accepted ever
reported a crime are between ages 36 and 40; 31 ­ 35 years
(30.2%) and 21 - 25 years (19%). While only 9.5% respon-
dents who conceded to having reported crimes to the police
are single, 52.4% are married, 19% divorced, and 19% wid-
owed. Rather than marriage impeding crime reporting
because of its numerous cultural encumbrances, it provided
crime-reporting resources in this study.
Twenty-one percent of surveyed respondents who
reported crime to the police hold First School Leaving
Certificate, West African School Certificate (33.3%),
National Certificate of Education (24.6%), and First
University Degree (10.5%). Education of respondents does
not appear to have tilted crime reporting to a direction that
could be considered significantly positive or negative. About
79.4% of the respondents who agreed to have reported crime
to the police are Muslims, Christians (11.1%) and others
(9.5%).
Although Muslim respondents reported more crimes in
this study, it should be borne in mind that different religions
have their diverse values. While crimes are mostly reported
by Muslims market women could be due, in part, to their
tradition, religion, and level of education. Crimes committed
by known offenders among the traditional Yoruba people are
usually not formally reported, especially when the victims do
not have western education. There are customary structures
in place to address these.
The value of loss that Muslim women respondents
incurred must have accounted for their high rate of crime
reporting. Otherwise, Muslims are noted to accept every
misfortune that befalls them as an act of God. Right from the
beginning of Nigeria, ethnic and religious tensions between
the different ethnic nationalities are primary challenges. At
different times, unpatriotic politicians have intensified the
crises by fanning the embers of political sentiments.
Ayodele 7
Nevertheless, Nigerians from diverse ethnic backgrounds
still interact in mutually rewarding contexts in their ordinary
everyday socioeconomic activities. It is, therefore, common
in Nigeria to have both Christian and Muslim women selling
in the same market, without any observable bitterness.
Beyond these, from their secondary market interactions, pro-
found primary relationships that often culminate into inter-
ethnic marriages are known to have developed. On the
whole, buying and selling are commonly done by Nigerians
without ethnic resentment.
The Nature of Crime Commonly Committed
Against Market Women in Oyo Town
Regarding the nature of crime and crime reporting, 71.1% of
the respondents revealed that their victimization involved
beating which caused them severe bodily injuries that neces-
sitated treatment at nearby clinics, which sometimes resulted
in outright admission; 15.6% said that it was offensive touch-
ing and 13.3% noted that it was outright rape. The respon-
dents said that their victimization involved theft of money
(60.6%), loss of food items (21.2%), and loss of moveable
economic items (18.2%). However, 10.5% respondents
observed that the offenders threatened persons they found on
their premises; 47.4% said that the offenders actually used
weapons and 42.1% confessed that no threat whatsoever was
used.
From the foregoing, it is clear that the offenders did not
have any particular crimes other than theft in mind.Therefore,
the time of the day in which a crime occurs has influence on
the crime-reporting practices of the respondents. About
21.1% of the respondents who reported crimes to the police
said that the crime took place in the morning, at night (66.7%)
and did not know precisely when the crime occurred (12.3%).
Majority of the crime that took place at the market occurred
at night when power outage was most likely and offenders
will have all the liberty in the world to cart away as much
items of the market women they could.
Victims' Handling of Reporting of Crimes
Committed Against Women's Businesses
Availability of alternative conflict resolution structures in
Oyo town, too, has its influence, no matter how subtle, on the
crime-reporting practices of market women. While 65.8% of
the reported their victimization to town association, 18.4%
reported to traditional rulers and 15.8% to Oodua People's
Congress (OPC). In Nigeria, the capacity of community resi-
dents to report crime has been badly frustrated by fear of
offender retaliation. For instance, in the time past, one noto-
rious armed robberAnini became a national threat so extraor-
dinary that Babangida as head of a military government
asked Etim Iyam, the then inspector general of police, after a
supreme council meeting, "My friend, where is Anini?" No
Nigerian was courageous enough to report his or her exploits
for fear of reprisal.
On arrest, Anini confessed that his gang had George
Iyamu, the deputy superintendent of police (DSP) as an
insider within the police hierarchy who shielded, would
reveal police secrets to them, and would give them logistic
support such as arms to carry out robbery operations. After
each operation, Iyamu joined the criminals in sharing their
loot.
As a result, he had choice buildings in Benin City as his
investment of the loots he obtained from men of the under-
world (Anini, 1986). Imagine, if any foolhardy community
resident had gone to report Anini and provided useful infor-
mation to the police which their ring leader, DSP Iyamu,
knew about, the consequence for that reporter meant nothing
short of death.
Rounding off a regime of crime typified by Anini in the
context of fear-invoking criminality in Nigeria, Omo-Agege
(1986) in his judgment said thatAnini will forever be remem-
bered in the history of crime in this country, but it would be
of unblessed memory. Few people if ever, would give the
name to their children. As a result of this, public trust in the
police has become incredibly low. Therefore, most of the
community residents who are victimized willingly explore
cultural structures for solution to their crime challenges,
instead of notifying the police.
Nevertheless, 48.7% who reported their victimization to
the police said that the police believed their reported crime
accounts, 35.9% said that the police arrested the offenders,
and 15.4% said that the police ignored them and their com-
plaints. Similarly, social network influences have a signifi-
cant effect on the crime-reporting practices of market women
in Oyo town. The people to whom the respondents confided
in about the occurrence of crimes determined the direction of
their crime-reporting preferences as 11.8% received support
from those they told, 27.5% said that such individuals
advised them, while 60.8% actually said that these individu-
als reported their victimizations to the police on their behalf.
Satisfaction of Market Women Victims With
Outcomes of Crimes Reported to the Police
How comfortable are these market women victims with the
processes involved in the formal reporting of their victimiza-
tion? None of the respondents were very satisfied with the
police handling of their complaints. While 65.8% are dissat-
isfied with the police, 18.4% are satisfied and 15.8% found it
extremely difficult to define their state of satisfaction with
police services. That majority of the respondents who
reported their victimization experiences to the police ended
dissatisfied bears eloquent statistical testimony to the level
of trust disconnect between the community and the police.
Despite all the shortcomings of the police, market women
showed a willingness to assist in making the police functional
8 SAGE Open
for public good by suggesting a way out of the commercial
insecurity of women at Oyo markets. Fifty percent of the
respondents suggested that the government should invest in
mass security education in the three main Nigerian ethnic lan-
guages (Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba) and 50% recommended
that voters should elect good leaders for Nigeria in future who
would be committed to ensuring public safety.
It is understandable when some respondents denied ever
having been victims because this has its roots in cultural ori-
entation. The meaning of crime in Yoruba is "oran," which is
often interpreted as a tragedy. In typically cultural parlance,
the criminal (odaran), his or her crime (oran), and the vic-
tims are symptoms of varying layers of misfortune.Therefore,
crime is often ascribed to cultural retribution of some kind.
Except a respondent has had a deep sense of detachment
from his or her natural entrapment by cultural socialization,
to accept being a victim of crime in a deeply cultural envi-
ronment is as clear as indicating that one is a cultural sinner.
In the study site, when someone is victimized, he or she is
commonly assumed to be atoning to a secretly committed
against the gods and rhythm of traditional order (cultural
sin). However, this claim has roots only in stereotypes, which
drive interaction among deeply traditional members of the
community. Among educated indigenes, this does not enjoy
any generic and considerable acceptance. For the fact that
crime victims are most likely to be stigmatized in traditional
surroundings, every victim would prefer to conceal his or her
state of victimhood to avoid some embarrassing interpreta-
tions and painful cultural labeling. Qualitative data support
most of the quantitative findings as insights from the contri-
butions of respondents of in-depth interview indicate :
Respondent A observed as follows:
Burglary of locked up shops is the most common crime that
market women face in Oyo town. We report them to market
leaders who then notify the police. However, by conduct, the
difference between the police and offenders is not clear. In
Nigeria, police corruption is not strange to anyone. Therefore, no
one is immune to police extortion. Occasionally, the police in
association with immigration officials raid open markets in which
market women do their legitimate businesses. The police use
force to retrieve smuggled goods. When these happen, Nigerians
unanimously condemn the police whose duty it was to have
prevented the entry of all these banned items, in the first place.
However, markets women's associations may reach special
arrangements with the police for protection which might involve
money payment; it is not common for police to collect money
from individual market women, ostensibly to provide protection.
This is not to deny the truth that the police usually make reporters
feel stupid as they request them to report at their stations at odd
times when the victims are supposed to be making efforts to
overcome their losses. At the end of the day, the offender may
never get apprehended and losses too never recovered. This is
double loss of some kind to us [market women].
Respondent B observed,
I have no confidence in the police. Whenever they are alerted,
they blow siren to alert the robbers of their arrival. In effect, the
offenders would just leisurely walk away, undetected. What
happened next? The police would begin to harass and arrest
innocent citizens as suspects of more scandalous crimes. To bail
themselves out from police net, they are made to pay various
forms of illegitimate dues. This is really a humiliating tradition
in the face of available best practices in crime control that
characterize the 21st century.
Respondent C observed,
It is like the bad eggs outnumber the ethical ones in the Nigeria
police. Government should totally overhaul the police and
provide jobs for our teeming youths to reduce the threat of
burglary to the economy of market women in Oyo town.
A female FGD argued,
The only way to counter deep-seated traditional fears of Oyo
women in terms of crime reporting of their abusers is to embark
on carefully coordinated crime-reporting education which will
commit them to reporting without inducing the police and
overcoming all cultural inhibitions to assert their rights in a
civilized manner.
Another female FGD observed,
The general air of discrimination against women on the basis of
their sex has widely spawned a culture that rejects modern
values which enjoin men to show consideration to women and
their concerns. Except market women rise as a critical vessel for
crime reporting, their economy may become more endangered
in future.
Respondent F, a female cloth seller, said,
When her trade experienced crime some few months before the
study, she was extremely traumatized. She felt the urge to report
hoping she would recover some of the items stolen but she feared
the offender might revenge after he must have been arrested,
prosecuted, punished and released. The police cannot be trusted
to keep the particulars of crime reporters confidential, as
expected.
Respondent G, an adult female smoked-fish seller, said,
Cases of abuse of market women are though disturbing, some of
them derive from long-standing practices that we have
grudgingly tolerated for years. We have started to feel the impact
of their onslaught more deeply and painfully. This informs our
unsolicited embrace of formal crime-reporting choices in
modern times.
Respondent H, an old female pepper seller, said,
Such business abuses by offenders were part of a pattern of
disturbing behaviour for years among young men in Oyo
communities. Most of their sympathizers often attempted to
reduce the effect of their misconduct by claiming that it was the
Ayodele 9
bad economy that drove young men to violate the rights of
market women in Oyo town. Beyond this, if all economy-
affected youth have to unleash their anger on market women,
will their mothers still remain in most homes perpetuating
motherhood activities?
Discussion and Conclusion
It is a verifiable statement that many crimes against market
women go unreported. This is probably so because of the
level of confidence the traders have in the police ability to
ensure recovery of stolen items through prompt apprehen-
sion of criminals. In the colonial epoch, the style and princi-
ples of policing have been described as anti-people by several
authors (Alemika & Chukwuma, 2000; Ikuteyijo, 2009;
Okafo, 2006; Rotimi, 2001). The unwholesome antagonism
between the police and the policed in the study site must
have taken its root from this unpleasant beginning.
Colonial police had a universal agenda. Everywhere there
was colonialism, the focus of the colonial police was to foist
compulsory order, tolerable or not, on the citizenry.
Therefore, to ensure that colonial subjects obeyed their mas-
ters hook, line and sinker, the colonial police probably, inad-
vertently, adopted adversarial policing which worsened the
already suspicious civilian/police relations in Nigeria.
For the foregoing and other reasons, market women in
Nigeria, generally, and those in Oyo town, in particular, are
encouraged to develop the culture of business insurance,
now that insurance policy has been liberalized, so that their
expectation of compensation could enhance their survival
competence and crime-reporting interest in the aftermath of
victimization. In the light of crime-reporting reality on
ground, the study suggests that market women in Oyo should
deemphasize spiritual security of their economic wealth and
invest in formal security channels and insurance.
The truth that most market women in Oyo town appear to
ignore is that crimes against their businesses are usually
crimes of opportunity. In some instances, individuals who
are not career offenders may offend simply because market
women leave their precious items without capable guardians.
With the economic dislocation that inundates most Nigerian
environments with employable but unemployed youth, frus-
trated individuals who hitherto did not have criminal inten-
tion may take advantage of carelessly exposed items in the
markets. In sum, if market women continue to make their
markets easy for criminals to steal from, chances are, every
situational criminal who otherwise might not have taken to
criminality will take advantage of this porous market situa-
tion, to help themselves.
Although the history of community police relation in
Nigeria has been described as frosty as the idea of policing
imposed on the country by the colonial masters was calcu-
lated to foster an antagonism between the policed and the
police (Alemika & Chukwuma, 2000; Onoja, 2007; Tamuno,
1970), a lot could still be achieved in terms of public secu-
rity, if Nigerians decide to make good of a bad job. It is,
therefore, concluded that making crime against their busi-
nesses risky, costly, and unrewarding through proactive and
protective measures is about the best option that Oyo market
women could explore in their circumstance to sustain their
businesses.
Recommendations
·
· Market women should overcome cultural limitations
and begin to disclose crimes they have been tradition-
ally disinclined to report.
·
· Public policy should simplify crime-reporting proce-
dures to further encourage women to report crimes
involving them and their varied interests.
·
· In addition to imbibing the culture of crime reporting,
market women should insure their business risks with
insurance companies to have something concrete in
terms of compensation to fall back on times of inevi-
table victimization. Therefore, market women should
take advantage of the ongoing (insurance liberaliza-
tion) simplified insurance conditions, through group
application, to insure their wares.
·
· Market women should save their money in banks on a
daily basis to reduce their losses at each victimization
episode by taking advantage of the (banking liberal-
ization) softened banking conditions, which encour-
age diverse saving packages that are convenient for
petty traders. Most banks have branches all over in
Nigeria and through their numerous aggressive mar-
keters are reaching out to petty traders to avail them-
selves of the available packages that ease bankability.
As yet, Nigerian banks do not discriminate against
customers on any grounds.
·
· Market women should invest more on crime preven-
tion strategies for less cost of business crime.
·
· The mind-set that crimes against businesses are natu-
ral costs of doing business and therefore facts of busi-
ness life should be changed because it is tolerant of
crimes and criminals.
·
· Women should report crime against their businesses,
so that criminal data emanating from them could form
critical guiding components for the development of
culturally based interventions.
