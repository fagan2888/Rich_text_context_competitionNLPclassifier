Abstract
Background and Aims: Anecdotal reports and studies of select populations suggest that the use of proton pump inhibitors
(PPIs) has increased since their introduction. We sought to determine recent trends in PPI use in the U.S. outpatient setting
and characteristics of patients and physicians that may predict their use.
Methods: We used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) to estimate the prevalence of visits in which patients used PPIs from 2002 to 2009. We
tested for associations between PPI use and patient, physician, and practice characteristics using data from 2009. We also
estimated the prevalence of visits in which PPIs were used by patients without gastrointestinal complaints, diagnoses, or
other indications for their use and tested for associations between patient and physician characteristics and PPI use in
patients with no documented indication.
Results: PPIs were used in 4.0% of visits in 2002 and 9.2% in 2009 (p,0.001 for trend across years). The use of omeprazole
(0.9% in 2002 to 3.9% in 2009, p,0.001), esomeprazole (0.9% in 2002 to 2.3% in 2009, p,0.001), and pantoprazole (0.6% in
2002 to 1.6% in 2009, p,0.001) increased significantly over the study period. Among visits by patients using PPIs, 62.9%
documented no gastrointestinal complaints, gastrointestinal diagnoses, or other indicated reason for their use.
Conclusions: We found that PPI use increased significantly from 2002 to 2009 as did documented indications for their use.
Newly-prescribed PPI use did not change from 2006 to 2009. More research is needed to determine whether PPIs are
overused in the U.S. outpatient setting.

Introduction
Overuse of healthcare services is often cited as a driver of rising
healthcare costs [1­4] and is an indicator of poor quality care [5­
7]. Anecdotal reports and studies of select populations suggest that
the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has increased since their
introduction in the late 1980s [8­15].
PPIs are used to treat gastrointestinal conditions such as gastro-
esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD)
or in patients who may be at high risk for these diseases (e.g.
patients on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories [NSAIDs] and anti-
platelet therapy). Although PPIs are generally believed to be safe
medications, recent studies indicate that there may be harms
associated with their use such as pneumonia and fracture [16­25].
Overuse of PPIs may put patients at unnecessary risk for these
harms and may also contribute to rising health care costs.
One study has documented increased PPI use in the U.S.
outpatient setting but to our knowledge, no studies have examined
very recent national trends in PPI use in the U.S. outpatient
setting, the characteristics of patients on PPIs, the characteristics of
physicians who prescribe PPIs, and trends in indications for their
use [13]. Knowledge of these trends and characteristics may
inform patients, physicians, payers, and policymakers who want to
receive or deliver high quality, high value care.
We used data from two national surveys of visits to ambulatory
physicians to describe recent trends in the use of PPIs in the
ambulatory setting. We explored potential reasons for these trends
by looking at changes in the prevalence of newly prescribed PPIs,
changes in histamine blocker (H2
-blocker) use, and changes in the
prevalence of indications for their use.
Methods
Source of Data
We used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical
Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2002 through 2009. The NAMCS
and NHAMCS are annual surveys conducted by the Center for
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56060
Disease Control's (CDC's) National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) on a nationally representative sample of visits to
physicians in office-based practices and hospital outpatient
departments [26­27].
The NAMCS and NHAMCS use a three-stage sampling design.
The first stage is based on geographic location, the second stage
identifies offices in each geographic location, and the third stage
samples visits within each office. The visits sampled take place
during a one week period that is randomly assigned for each
practice. Between 20% and 100% of the visits that week are
sampled depending on the size of the practice. The NCHS weighs
each visit so that the data can be used for national estimates. Each
visit weight accounts for selection probability, adjusts for non-
response, and accounts for other factors so that the national
estimates properly reflect the scope of ambulatory visits in the U.S.
Physicians in the fields of anesthesiology, radiology, and pathology
are excluded from the survey. Physicians who participate in the
survey cannot participate again for at least three years. There has
been no change in the sampling design for our study period.
The surveys collect physician and office demographics, patient
demographics, and visit-specific clinical information. For each
visit, the surveys record up to three diagnoses based on the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9 CM) and up to three reasons for visits which are based on
the patient's complaints or symptoms. The surveys also record up
to eight medications that the patient is currently taking or that are
prescribed at the visit. The survey specifically asks for both
prescribed and over-the-counter medications. The information
from each visit is recorded on a standardized survey form by the
physician, office staff, or a U.S. Census Bureau representative.
Each visit is weighted so that national estimates can be calculated.
The study was approved by the institutional review board of Weill
Cornell Medical College.
Study Design and Sample
We performed a trend analysis using NAMCS and NHAMCS
data from 2002 to 2009 and a cross-sectional analysis using data
from 2009. We included all visits by patients 18 years and older
who saw a physician.
Variables
Our main outcome variable was PPI use calculated both as the
number and percent of visits in which a PPI was prescribed,
ordered, supplied, administered, or continued. PPIs included
omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esome-
prazole (Table 1) [28]. We excluded dexlansoprazole because it
was introduced in 2009 and was used in very few visits in that year.
To understand whether changes in use could have been due to
more new PPI prescriptions, decreased H2
-blocker use, or more
documented indications for PPIs, we also looked at new PPI
prescription and overall H2
-blocker use and documented indica-
tions (see below). H2
-blockers included ranitidine, cimetidine, and
famotidine (Table 1) [28].
Our main predictor variables were year (2002 to 2009), patient
age, patient gender, patient race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic,
other), number of chronic medical conditions (0, 1­3, .3),
primary payer (private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, other),
physician specialty category (primary care, medical specialist,
surgical specialist), and practice type (private practice, community
health center, health maintenance organization, hospital outpa-
tient department, other).
We defined an indication for PPI use as a visit in which a
gastrointestinal diagnosis (GERD, gastrointestinal ulcer, gastroin-
testinal bleed, esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal varices,
dyspepsia, gastritis, Helicobacter Pylori infection, malignant
neoplasm of the esophagus or stomach, hepatitis, or liver disease)
was documented, the patient reported a gastrointestinal complaint
or a potential symptom that may be caused by a gastrointestinal
diagnosis (gastrointestinal bleeding, heartburn, abdominal pain,
chest pain, or cough), or documentation of a medication where
prophylaxis might be necessary (NSAIDs, anti-platelet therapies,
steroids) [29].
Analysis
We performed a visit-level analysis using visit sampling weights
to account for clustering at the physician and practice level and to
generate national estimates of counts and percentages. We used
the Pearson chi-squared test to compare patient and physician
characteristics between 2002­2003 and 2008­2009. We used
linear regression to test for linear trends in PPI use (overall and for
specific PPIs) between 2002 and 2009 while controlling for patient

and physician characteristics (age, gender, payer, race/ethnicity,
type of practice).
We used the Pearson chi-squared test and multivariable logistic
regression to test for associations between PPI use and patient,
physician, and practice characteristics using data from 2008 and
2009. We also estimated the prevalence of visits in which PPIs
were used by patients without gastrointestinal diagnoses, com-
plaints, or concomitant high-risk medication use. We used
multivariable logistic regression to test for associations between
the patient and physician characteristics described above and PPI
use in patients with no documented indication. All tests were two-
sided with a p-value of 0.05 considered significant.
Results
There were approximately 772 million ambulatory visits by
adults patients in 2002. The number of ambulatory visits increased
to 919 million visits in 2009. Patients seen in 2008­2009 were
older than patients seen in 2002­2003 (47.6% $65 years in 2008­
2009 vs. 40.5$65 years in 2002­2003), their primary payer was
more likely to be Medicare (46.5% in 2008­2009 vs. 36.0% in
2002­2003), and were more likely to be see in a community health
center (2.7% in 2008­2009 vs. 0.2% in 2002­2003) (Table 2).
The number of visits with documented PPI use increased from
30 million visits in 2002 to 84 million visits in 2009 (Figure 1A).
Overall PPI use rose significantly from 2002 to 2009 (4.0% of visits
in 2002 to 9.2% of visits in 2009, p,0.001, Figure 1B) even after
controlling for patient, physician, and practice demographic
changes. We found significant increases in the use of omeprazole
(0.9% of visits in 2002 to 3.9% of visits in 2009, p,0.001),
esomeprazole (0.9% of visits in 2002 to 2.3% of visits in 2009,
p,0.001), and pantoprazole (0.6% of visits in 2002 to 1.6% of
visits in 2009, p,0.001). These findings were, again, significant
even after controlling for patients, physician, and practice
demographic changes.

In 2008 and 2009, patients on PPIs were older than patients not
on PPIs (46.7% of patients on PPIs were .65 vs. 30.3% of patients
not on PPIs, p,0.001) and were more likely to have one or more
chronic medical conditions (81.9% vs. 64.3%, p,0.001) (Table 3).
Patients on PPIs were more likely to be seeing a primary care
physician (55.0% vs. 51.3%, p,0.001) or medical specialist
(34.2% vs. 27.1%, p,0.001) than a surgeon (10.8% vs. 21.6%,
p,0.001).
From 2006 to 2009, the percentage of newly prescribed PPIs
was very small and did not increase (1.1% of visits in 2006 vs.
1.1% of visits in 2009, p = 0.03, Figure 2A). From 2002 to 2009,
H2
-blocker use did not decrease and, in fact, increased a small but
significant amount (1.1% of visits in 2002 to 1.6% of visits in 2009,
p = 0.04, Figure 2B). Possible indications for their use among all
visits increased from 2002 to 2009 (14.9% of visits in 2001 to
20.0% of visits in 2009, p,0.001) but the percentage of visits with

a documented indication for their use among patients on PPIs did
not change (34.4% of visits in 2002 to 37.1% of visits in 2009,
p = 0.07).
In all years, the majority of visits with documented PPI use had
no documented indication (Figure 2B). Among visits by patients
using PPIs in 2009, 62.9% of patients had no documented
gastrointestinal complaints, gastrointestinal diagnoses, or concom-
itant high-risk medication. In multivariable analyses, we found no
correlation between any physician or practice characteristics and
PPI use without a documented indication (Table 4).
Discussion
In this study of PPI use in the ambulatory setting, we found
almost a three-fold increase in their use in recent years. In 2009,
PPI use was documented in almost a tenth of ambulatory visits
(over 80 million visits) compared with close to 4 percent of visits in
2002.
We explored three potential reasons for increased use of PPIs:
continuation of previously prescribed PPIs, a shift to use PPIs
rather than other acid reducers such as H2
-blockers, and more
reasons for their use because of gastrointestinal diagnoses, patient
symptoms, and medications.
Our finding of little change in new prescriptions for PPIs
suggests that patients stay on PPIs chronically, that they may be
started in settings other than the outpatient setting (e.g. hospital,
nursing home), or that self-prescribe over-the-counter PPIs. The
second explanation is not supported by our findings: H2
-blocker
use did not decrease over the study period and, in fact, increased
over our study period. The third explanation, increased docu-
mented indications, may also contribute to increased PPI use over
the study period.
Nevertheless, in all study years, we found that the majority of
visits with documented PPI use had no documented indication for
their use. These findings raise the question of whether PPI use
since 2002 reflects overuse rather than appropriate use. Potential
reasons for overuse include PPI continuation after a short term
indication (e.g. hospitalization), a belief that PPIs offer benefit with
little harm, and aggressive marketing to patients and physicians.
Interestingly, the two individual PPIs with the most significant
increase in their use were omeprazole and esomeprazole. Both of
these medications are made by the same manufacturer (Astra
Zeneca) and their increased use may reflect effective marketing -
both medications have been marketed as ``purple pills'' in multiple
media setting [30]. However, this may be mere coincidence
particularly because esomeprazole is not the most frequently
prescribed PPI. Increased omeprazole use may also be the result of
increased availability as an over-the-counter medication, its long
time on the market, and its availability in generic formulations
[28].
Our findings are in concert with reports that PPI use is
increasing worldwide. Reports from Taiwan, the United King-
dom, and Australia have all documented increased use [10,14,15].
For example, in Australia, researchers found a greater than one
thousand-fold increase in PPI use from 1995 to 2006 [9]; in the
United Kingdom researchers have documented that a majority of
PPIs are prescribed inappropriately [14].
Unfortunately, recent work has elucidated potential harms of
PPIs including pneumonia, fracture, enteric infection, and
malabsorption [16­25]. One study found a 1.6 fold increased risk
of community acquired pneumonia in patients on PPIs [22].
Another found a 1.3 fold increased odds of hospital-acquired
pneumonia in patients on PPIs [19]. Analyses of data from the
United Kingdom showed a 1.5 fold increased risk of hip fracture
with long-term PPI use [24].
Further, literature also suggests that the benefits of PPIs may be
overstated particularly for prophylaxis in hospitalized patients
[25]. In fact, a recent literature review found no significant
difference in stress ulcer prevalence in hospitalized patients who
received H2
-blockers and PPIs [21]. If, in fact, such a high
percentage of patients are on PPIs for no reason, we may be
putting patients at undue risk.
Our study is limited primarily by the data available through the
NAMCS and NHAMCS. First, our evaluation is at the visit level,
not at the patient level so the percentages we report of percent of
visits, not percent of patients. It is possible that there is not a direct
correlation between the number of patients on PPIs and their use
documented at the visit level or it is possible that patients on PPIs
have more visits than patients not on PPIs. We did, however, look
at trends across years and documented medication use, diagnoses,
and symptoms at the visit level for multiple years. Second, our data
are limited to what is documented from the patient record.

Although the surveys do ask for over-the-counter medications, it is
possible that PPIs that are available over-the-counter may not be
documented in the patient record. Conversely, we may be
overestimating potentially inappropriately used PPIs because not
all symptoms, diagnoses, and medications are documented in
NAMCS and NHAMCS. We also do not know whether PPIs were
prescribed on an as needed basis (prn) or the duration of therapy.
Lastly, it is possible that patients remain on PPIs long-term
because of rebound symptoms when they are removed from PPIs
[31].
In summary, we found a large and significant increase in PPI
use in the U.S. outpatient setting since 2002 but no increase in PPI
use without a documented indication or in new PPI prescriptions.
Nevertheless, the majority of patients on PPIs in all years had no
documented indication. Our findings confirm what has been
documented in smaller settings, older studies and international
settings. Our findings suggest that inappropriate PPI use is not
necessarily increasing but is still an important public health
problem.
While growing evidence points out important adverse associa-
tions with PPIs, they do remain effective drugs for their specified
indications. More research is needed to fully understand the scope
of overuse of PPIs in the ambulatory setting. These methods
include more granular reviews of their use in the ambulatory
setting or studies to understand why physicians prescribe and
patients use PPIs when the indications are not clear. Further
research should also address methods to change physician and
patient decisions regarding their use. Interventions such as
education, treatment guidelines, and decision support systems
may address this problem. Ultimately, however, physicians,
payers, policymakers, and even patients should be tasked with
evaluating the need for PPI therapy, especially for long-term use.
