INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE OBESITY
(body mass index [BMI] 40)
encounter serious and potentially
life-threatening complications,
including diabetes, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, asthma, and arthritis,1
and substantial reductions in life
expectancy.2 Repeated cross-sectional
and self-reported data suggest that
severe obesity prevalence has
increased substantially over the past
few decades,3-7 potentially increasing
at a faster rate than moderate obesity.6
In 2000, an estimated 2.2% of adults,3
or 4.8 million individuals, were
severely obese,8,9 with a disproportion-
ately higher prevalence in women and
racial/ethnic minorities.3,4,7 Yet, few
national studies track individuals over
time to understand the progression of
obesity to severe obesity.
Diet, exercise, and behavioral modi-
fication are recommended as initial
treatments for severe obesity, result-
ing in short-term weight loss, which,
when combined with pharmaco-
therapy, can be associated with a 5% to
10% reduction in weight.10,11 How-
ever, antiobesity pharmacological
agents have substantial adverse ef-
fects, and discontinuation often re-
sults in weight regain.11 In contrast, bar-
iatric surgery results in weight loss
ranging from 60% to 70% for at least
10 years and commonly results in com-
plete resolution or improvement in co-
morbidities after surgery.12 As such, bar-
iatric surgery is the only treatment that
has been shown to have long-term suc-
cess,13 yet this procedure has major po-
tential complications, including leak-
age, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism,
band slippage, and band erosion.14

Context Although the prevalence of obesity has increased in recent years, indi-
viduals who are obese early in life have not been studied over time to determine
whether they develop severe obesity in adulthood, thus limiting effective interven-
tions to reduce severe obesity incidence and its potentially life-threatening associ-
ated conditions.
Objective To determine incidence and risk of severe obesity in adulthood by ado-
lescent weight status.
Design, Setting, and Participants A cohort of 8834 individuals aged 12 to 21
years enrolled in 1996 in wave II of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health, followed up into adulthood (ages 18-27 years during wave III [2001-2002]
and ages 24-33 years during wave IV [2007-2009]). Height and weight were ob-
tained via anthropometry and surveys administered in study participants' homes using
standardized procedures.
Main Outcome Measures New cases of adult-onset severe obesity were calcu-
lated by sex, race/ethnicity, and adolescent weight status. Sex-stratified, discrete
time hazard models estimated the net effect of adolescent obesity (aged 20 years;
body mass index [BMI] 95th percentile of the sex-specific BMI-for-age growth
chart or BMI 30.0) on risk of severe obesity incidence in adulthood (aged 20
years; BMI 40.0), adjusting for race/ethnicity and age and weighted for national
representation.
Results In 1996, 79 (1.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7%-1.4%) adolescents
were severely obese; 60 (70.5%; 95% CI, 57.2%-83.9%) remained severely obese in
adulthood. By 2009, 703 (7.9%; 95% CI, 7.4%-8.5%) non­severely obese adoles-
cents had become severely obese in adulthood, with the highest rates for non-
Hispanic black women. Obese adolescents were significantly more likely to develop
severe obesity in young adulthood than normal-weight or overweight adolescents (haz-
ard ratio, 16.0; 95% CI, 12.4-20.5).
Conclusion In this cohort, obesity in adolescence was significantly associated with
increased risk of incident severe obesity in adulthood, with variations by sex and race/
ethnicity.

Given the lack of successful treatment
options, risks associated with treat-
ment, and numerous health conse-
quences of severe obesity, primary pre-
vention is critical.
Understanding which individuals are
at risk of severe obesity is essential for
determining when interventions would
needtobeimplementedtopreventobese
individuals from progressing to severe
obesity. Although observational stud-
ies have reported that the prevalences of
overweight, obesity, and severe obesity
have increased in recent years,8,15 indi-
viduals who are obese early in life have
not been studied longitudinally to de-
termine their risk of developing severe
obesity in adulthood. To this end, we
used a US nationally representative, lon-
gitudinal cohort to determine the inci-
dence and risk of severe obesity in adult-
hoodamongindividualswhowereobese
during adolescence.
METHODS
National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health
The National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health) is a co-
hort of adolescents (20 745 individu-
als aged 11-20 years at baseline; mean
age, 15.9 years) drawn from a sample
of 80 high schools and 52 middle
schools in the United States with un-
equal probability of selection. Incor-
porating systematic sampling meth-
ods and implicit stratification into the
Add Health study design ensured that
this sample is representative of US
schools in 1994-1995 with respect to
region, urbanicity, school size, school
type, and ethnicity.
Poststratification sample weights en-
sure that population estimates at each
wave conform to population estimates
from individuals eligible for each inter-
view; thus, the respondents are repre-
sentative of the US school population in
grades7through12in1994-1995(wave
I) as they are followed into adulthood.
Wave II, conducted in 1996 (n=14 738;
mean age, 16.5 years) included wave I
adolescents still of school age by de-
sign (including those currently in high
schoolandhighschooldropouts).Wave
III, conducted in 2001-2002 (n=15197;
mean age, 22.3 years) and wave IV, con-
ducted in 2007-2009 (n=15 701; mean
age, 28.9 years) included all wave I re-
spondents, regardless of wave II partici-
pation. The most recent data collection
(wave IV) includes follow-up inter-
views from 15 701 wave I respondents
drawnfrom19962oftheoriginal20745
wave I respondents (exclusions: 96 de-
ceased at wave III and 687 not sampled
at wave III), with 80.25% of the eligible
respondents(ineligible:184whomoved
out of the country, 87 military sta-
tioned out of the country, and 126 de-
ceased at wave IV) consenting to par-
ticipate in wave IV.
Written informed consent was ob-
tained for all wave I participants. Sur-
vey procedures have been described
elsewhere and were approved by the in-
stitutional review board at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.16
Measures
Weight and height were measured in
waves II through IV during in-home
surveys using standardized proce-
dures. Wave I used self-reported height
and weight data, which were excluded
from this analysis because the gain in
1 additional year of follow-up was not
an acceptable trade-off for the error that
would have been introduced with use
of a combination of self-report (wave
I) and measured (waves II-IV) height
and weight data.
Bodymassindex(calculatedasweight
in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared) and BMI percentiles from
measured height and weight were de-
rived for age and sex using the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention Na-
tionalCenterforHealthStatisticsgrowth
charts.17 Given that adolescent BMI
(wave II; 1996) was not linearly associ-
ated with incident severe obesity, BMI
was categorized using the recom-
mended definitions for comparability
across adolescence and adulthood.18
Thesecategoriesweredefinedas:(1)nor-
mal weight (5th to 85th percentile
on BMI-for-age growth chart or BMI of
18.5 to 25 for individuals aged 20
years; BMI of 18.5 to 25 for indi-
viduals aged 20 years); (2) over-
weight (85th to 95th percentile or
BMI of 25 to 30 for individuals aged
20 years; BMI of 25 to 30 for in-
dividuals aged 20 years); (3) obesity
(95th to 120% of 95th percentile or
BMI of 30 to 40 for individuals aged
20 years; BMI of 30 to 40 for in-
dividuals aged 20 years); and (4) se-
vere obesity (120% of 95th percentile
for individuals aged 20 years19; BMI of
40forindividualsaged20years).Re-
spondents who exceeded scale capacity
(for wave III: 330 lb [148.5 kg] [n=12];
forwaveIV:440lb[198kg][n=2])were
classified as severely obese. Incident se-
vere obesity in adulthood was classified
as nonsevere obesity at adolescence
(wave II) and severe obesity at adult-
hood (wave III or IV; 2001-2009).
Age was recorded as the respon-
dent's age on the date of examination.
Age at onset of severe obesity was de-
fined as age at the wave in which the
individual was initially classified as se-
verely obese. We observed a nonlinear
relationship between age at onset of se-
vere obesity and development of se-
vere obesity in young adulthood; thus,
we categorized age at onset of severe
obesity as younger than 20 years (ref-
erence), 20 to 24.9 years, 25 to 29.9
years, and 30 years or older.
Consistent with previous Add Health
research,20,21 race/ethnicity was ob-
tained from a combination of in-home
surveys from parents and adolescents
and was categorized as non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic
(Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South
American, Mexican, or other His-
panic), or Asian American (Chinese,
Filipino, or other Asian).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted
using Stata software, version 10.1 (Stata
Corp, College Station, Texas). To ac-
count for Add Health's stratified sam-
pling strategy, clustered sampling de-
sign, and nonresponse bias,22,23 sample
weights and survey analysis tech-
niques were used in all analyses. All re-
sults are nationally representative of
adolescents who were enrolled in grades

7 through 12 in 1994 and followed up
into adulthood.
For descriptive analyses, percent-
ages were calculated for categorical vari-
ables, while means were calculated for
continuous variables. To compare in-
dividuals with incident severe obesity
with individuals without severe obe-
sity, a 2-sided t test and F statistic were
used to test for statistical differences
(P.05). Incidence rates of severe obe-
sity during the transition from adoles-
cence to adulthood were calculated by
sex, race/ethnicity, and adolescent
weight status (normal, overweight, and
obese). A 2-sided F statistic was used
to compare the incidence of severe obe-
sity by these categories, and the Bon-
ferroni correction (P=.0167) was ap-
plied for multiple comparisons.
Discrete time hazard models (with
a complementary log-log link), a
type of a survival analysis model
appropriate when the outcome is
ascertained at periodic measure-
ments,24,25 were used to determine
the relationship between adolescent
obesity and incidence of severe obe-
sity in adulthood. Given the rela-
tively low incidence of severe obesity
in individuals who had normal
weight as adolescents, the 3 catego-
ries used to obtain absolute inci-
dence rates (normal weight, over-
weight, and obese) were condensed
to 2 categories, obese vs nonobese
(ie, collapsing normal weight and
overweight into the nonobese cat-
egory) for the hazard analyses. Given
the particular discrete time interval
based on the examination dates and
obesity data, models were condi-
tioned on time as a unit of analysis,
with age at the examination during
which severe obesity was first
recorded serving as the primary time
variable in all models. Age-specific
hazard ratios (incidence rate ratios)
were calculated for the probability of
becoming severely obese during a
given age range, conditioned on no
severe obesity at the beginning of
that interval. Discrete time hazard
models assume that once individuals
become severely obese, they remain
severely obese and, thus, while
included in models, they no longer
contribute to the analysis.
The hazard models included only
race and sex to provide net effects of
risk rather than causal modeling of
these relationships. Thus, a parsimo-
nious model was used to describe the
relationship between adolescent obe-
sity (vs nonobesity) and risk of severe
obesity in adulthood. To determine
whether the relationship between
adolescent obesity and severe obesity
risk varied by sex and race/ethnicity, a
3-way interaction was used to exam-
ine effect modification using Wald
tests (P=.10). Despite borderline sig-
nificance (P=.14), differences in the
associations across race/ethnicity are
clinically important given the racial/
ethnic disparities in the prevalence of
obesity and its comorbidities. Thus,
final models were sex-stratified and
included interactions between adoles-
cent obesity and race/ethnicity. Addi-
tionally, effect measure modification
by age at severe obesity onset with
adolescent obesity and age at severe
obesity onset with race/ethnicity was
tested, but neither showed effect
modification.

to correct for nonresponse bias and
sample design) (n=3699), height and
weight data at wave II (n=46) or wave
III or 4 (n=436), or race/ethnicity
(n=74); individuals who were under-
weight (because the amount of weight
gain necessary to shift from under-
weight to severe obesity in the 13-year
time frame of the study could indicate
a different phenotype or surrogate for
other metabolic conditions) (n=1381);
and girls/women who were pregnant at
baseline (n=144). Given interest in in-
cident severe obesity, individuals who
were already severely obese at base-
line (n=79 [1.0%; 95% confidence in-
terval {CI}, 0.7%-1.4%]) were ex-
cluded; these 79 individuals were more
likely to be racial/ethnic minorities than
participants included in the analytic
sample and most (n=60 [70.5%; 95%
CI, 57.2%-83.9%]) remained severely
obese in adulthood (result not shown).
The final analytic sample included all
available exposure, outcome, and co-
variate data across waves II, III, and IV,
totaling 15 598 observations across
8834 individuals. The analytic sample
included significantly more whites,
older individuals, and individuals of
higher parental education than those
excluded. However, inverse probabil-
ity weighting showed no evidence of se-
lection bias by these factors in final
models.
Over the 13-year period between
adolescence (1996) and adulthood
(2007-2009), a total of 703 incident
cases of severe obesity in adulthood
were observed, indicating a total inci-
dence rate of 7.9% (95% CI, 7.4%-
8.5%) (TABLE 1). Individuals with in-
cident severe obesity in adulthood had
a higher adolescent BMI, were older,
and were more likely to be racial/
ethnic minorities compared with indi-
viduals without severe obesity.
A substantial proportion of obese
adolescents became severely obese by
their early 30s, with significant varia-
tion by sex (TABLE 2). Among indi-
viduals who were obese as adoles-
cents, incident severe obesity was 37.1%
(95% CI, 30.6%-43.6%) in men and
51.3% (95% CI, 44.8%-57.8%) in
women. Incident severe obesity was
highest among black women at 52.4%
(95% CI, 40.9%-63.8%). Across all sex
and racial/ethnic groups, less than 5%
of individuals who were at a normal
weight in adolescence became se-
verely obese in adulthood.
In analysis using multivariate, dis-
crete hazard models, obese adoles-
cents were significantly more likely to
develop severe obesity than normal-
weight or overweight adolescents (haz-
ard ratio, 16.0; 95% CI, 12.4-20.5), with
variation across race/ethnicity and sex
(TABLE 3). While the hazard ratio for
men was higher than for women, the
incidence of severe obesity in adult-
hood was higher among women
(51.3%; 95% CI, 44.8%-57.8%) than
men (37.1%; 95% CI, 30.6%-43.6%).
Thus, the male-female differences in
risk must be interpreted relative to the
difference in rates of incidence.
COMMENT
Taking advantage of a nationally repre-
sentative longitudinal data set, we ob-
served high rates of incident severe obe-
sityinadulthoodamongindividualswho
were obese earlier in life, with a higher
incidence in women (vs men) and with
the highest risk for black women. These
nationally representative estimates sug-
gest that approximately 125 000 indi-
viduals may have been severely obese
duringadolescence,whileanother1mil-
lion adolescents may have become se-
verely obese by the time they reached
their early 30s. Over the 13-year study
period, individuals who never devel-
oped severe obesity gained an average of
5.1 BMI units, whereas individuals who
developedsevereobesityasadultsgained
an average of 14.2 BMI units. Further-
more, obese adolescents were at sub-
stantially higher risk of developing
severeobesityinadulthoodthannormal-
weight or overweight adolescents.

Rates of obesity have increased across
all age groups, with cross-sectional Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey data suggesting a severe
obesity prevalence of 4.2% for men and
7.6% for women in young adulthood
(aged 20-39 years) in 2008.15 Short-
term self-reported data suggest that se-
vere obesity might be increasing at a
faster rate than moderate obesity.6 This
increaseisparticularlyconcerninggiven
the serious and potentially life-
threatening complications associated
with severe obesity. Yet, little is known
regarding the persistence of severe obe-
sity, the progression of obesity to se-
vere obesity, and how risk differs by sex
and race/ethnicity. Understanding these
patterns is critical for reducing the bur-
den of obesity and for implementing in-
terventions to prevent the progression
of obesity to severe obesity. Findings
from current research suggest that in-
terventions designed to prevent adult-
onset severe obesity would best be
implemented among obese adoles-
cents, particularly black girls.
Although previous studies have
shown a persistence of obesity from
childhood and adolescence to adult-
hood,26,27 there are no known studies
that have examined persistence and
developmentofsevereobesity.Thecur-
rent findings indicate that (1) there is
strongpersistenceofsevereobesityfrom
adolescence to young adulthood; (2)
there is a relatively high incidence rate
of severe obesity during the transition
from adolescence to adulthood; and (3)
individuals who were obese as adoles-
cents were significantly more likely to
become severely obese in adulthood,
highlighting the need for primary and
secondary prevention of severe obe-
sity early in the life course. In particu-
lar, primary prevention efforts should
focus on the prevention of obesity prior
to adolescence, while secondary pre-
ventioneffortsshouldfocusontheiden-
tification and treatment of high-risk
groups in adolescence, including over-
weight and obese adolescents.
There are a few limitations to this
analysis. The main objective of this
study was to determine the incidence
of severe obesity during the transition
from adolescence to adulthood and to
determine which groups are at high-
est risk. As such, the analytic strategy
was designed to test the net effects of
race/ethnicity and sex on severe obe-
sity rather than undertake causal mod-
eling of these relationships. Clearly, sev-
eral other biological, sociocultural, and
environmental factors associated with
race/ethnicity and sex are likely to affect
severe obesity incidence. Future re-
search should address the specific fac-
tors associated with onset of severe obe-
sity. A second limitation to this research
is the use of conventional albeit some-
what arbitrary BMI cut points. These cut
points do not capture differences in in-
cidenceofobesitycomorbiditiesthatex-
ist on the continuum of BMI values.28
Likewise, cut points do not capture the
complex process of body weight regu-
lation29 or the gradual process of weight
gain.30 However, cut points are needed
for clinical guidance28 and for compara-
tive purposes.18 Finally, while unique
longitudinal data were available for the
period from adolescence to young
adulthood, these data are nationally rep-
resentative of the school-aged popula-
tion in 1994-1995 that were followed
up over time into adulthood and, thus,
are not nationally representative of the
population aged 24 to 33 years at fol-
low-up.

aSample consists of 8834 individuals with measurements in adolescence (wave II [1996; 13-21 years]) and in adulthood
(wave III [2001-2002; 18-26 years] and wave IV [2007-2009; 24-33 years]). Incident severe obesity defined as individuals
who became severely obese in young adulthood (waves III-IV). Results were weighted for national representation and
standard errors were corrected for multiple stages of cluster sample design and unequal probability of selection.
bWithin adolescent weight status group, male-female differences are statistically significant (P.05 by F statistic).
cData for Asians should be interpreted with caution because of small sample size.
dWithin sex and adolescent weight status groups, white-Asian differences are statistically significant (P.0167 by F sta-
tistic with Bonferroni correction).
eWithin sex and adolescent weight status groups, white-black differences are statistically significant (P.0167 by F sta-
tistic with Bonferroni correction).

In summary, data from a nationally
representative, ethnically diverse lon-
gitudinal sample suggest a high inci-
dence of severe obesity during the tran-
sition from adolescence to adulthood.
The clinical implications of these ob-
served trends are concerning given the
comorbidities and chronic disease as-
sociated with severe obesity.4,31,32 Find-
ings highlight the need for interven-
tions prior to adulthood to prevent the
progression of obesity to severe obe-
sity, which may reduce severe obesity
incidence and its potentially life-
threatening consequences.
