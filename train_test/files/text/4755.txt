Introduction
Neuroaesthetics studies and provides frameworks for inter-
preting brain structures and functions of creative artists and
receptive audiences. As characteristically part of or accom-
panying the production and enjoyment of artworks, aesthetic
experience is one particularly rewarding type of experience
in which personal and theoretical interest are understandable.
This paper aims to identify the potential of neuroaesthetics to
contribute to philosophically motivated investigations of art
and to critically evaluate and undermine skepticism about
such contributions. In particular, it is proposed that aesthetic
experience involves a distinctive corticolimbic response, that
such experience is therefore testable and may be found even
with so-called anti-art, and that its value consists in resolu-
tion of conflict between the higher cortex and limbic system
generated by the evolution of the former.
The term "neuroaesthetics" (minus the "a" and hyphen-
ated) appears to have been coined by the neuroscientist
Semir Zeki (1999). Published the very same year as Zeki's
Inner Vision was a special issue of The Journal of
Consciousness Studies whose target article, by the neurosci-
entist V. S. Ramachandran and philosopher William Hirstein
(1999), fomented enough controversy to spawn two special-
issue sequels. Although the field has grown and developed
significantly since then (e.g., see Skov & Vartanian, 2009),
the focus here will be on these earlier attempts because of
their comparatively broad scope and clearer relevance to the
skepticism addressed. Still, it is neuroaesthetics generally
that is central here, as both these illustrative cases appear to
justify philosophical skepticism about neuroaesthetics yet
reveal the potential contribution of neuroaesthetics, in some
form or the other, to the philosophy of art. Such use seems
consistent with Ramachandran's (2001) own assessment
(p. 28) of "The Science of Art" as suggesting the form a final
theory might take. The argument is that not only does skepti-
cism about neuroaesthetics prove false, its target might yield
the necessary bridge between traditional philosophy of art
and a robust, insightful, truly interdisciplinary aesthetics. Art
history is tangential to this direction of argument, but the his-
tory of philosophical aesthetics, of art theory in this sense, is
not. This is not to say that anthropology and art history,
among other areas, will not contribute to a complete theoreti-
cal picture of art (see, for example, respectively, Dissanayake,
1995; Onians, 2007). However, the focus in this article is on
the particular, often divisive tension between philosophy and
neuroscience in theorizing about art.
The controversy spurred by Ramachandran and Hirstein
(1999) among some philosophers had a threefold cause: the
authors' temerity in suggesting that theory of art might ben-
efit from neuroscience (and might be stymied by neglecting
it), comfort in making sweeping claims of perhaps uncertain
scope under the heading "8 laws of aesthetic experience"

Neuroaesthetics and Philosophy
Jason Holt1
Abstract
Some philosophers even recently have been skeptical about whether science can reveal anything significant about art.
Although some scientists' ventures into art theory have seemed to warrant such suspicions, including early speculative forays
into neuroaesthetics, against such skepticism, the argument here is that neuroaesthetics is crucial for understanding aesthetic
experience and ultimately art itself. Because certain core proposals of early versions of neuroaesthetics (e.g., the art-as-
caricature thesis) seem to justify this skepticism and yet, at the same time, prove more defensible than they might initially
seem, they are ideal illustrations of how neuroaesthetics at a more abstract level dovetails with the philosophy of art, and so
provides a complementary, not competing perspective that can help complete, verify, and defend such philosophical theories.
In particular, it is proposed that aesthetic experience involves a distinctive corticolimbic response, that such experience is
therefore testable and may be found even with so-called anti-art, and that its value consists in resolution of conflict between
the higher cortex and limbic system generated by the evolution of the former.

(which became 10 laws in Ramachandran, 2003), and appar-
ent naïveté in attempting the task without perhaps knowing
enough about art. E. H. Gombrich's (2000) commentary is a
single 12-line paragraph, cuttingly dismissive: "Even a fleet-
ing visit to one of the great museums might serve to convince
the authors that few of the exhibits conform to the laws of art
they postulate" (p. 17). The first special issue contained
understandably eager and wide-ranging objections (Baars,
1999; Gregory, 1999; Kindy, 1999; Lanier, 1999; Mangan,
1999; Martindale, 1999; Mitter, 1999; Wallen, 1999), which
promptedclarificationsandrefinements(e.g.,Ramachandran,
2001; 2003). Yet others have suggested that there remain
untapped riches in the original paper. For instance, Tyler
(1999) rightly observes that the principle of perceptual
problem-solving (one of the 8 laws), though glossed over to
the point of neglect in "The Science of Art," is perhaps the
principle that might be of most interest to artists themselves;
in perceptual problem-solving there is an isomorphism
between the artist's process of creating the visual "puzzle" of
the work and the viewer's experience of "solving" it. It is in
such a spirit that this article is written.
The importance of exploring the potential of neuroaes-
thetics for aiding understanding of not only aesthetic experi-
ence, which is plausible enough on its face, but the nature of
art, which might not be as plausible a connection, is reflected
in the present state of the art of philosophical aesthetics.
After Danto's (1964; 1981) landmark work on indiscern-
ibles, which focused on what distinguishes art (e.g., Andy
Warhol's Brillo Boxes) from perceptually indistinguishable
non-art (e.g., ordinary Brillo boxes), attention shifted away
from the earlier view that art is indefinable to theories pur-
porting to give necessary and sufficient conditions for art by
focusing on the relations between artist and artwork in the
first instance and artwork and audience in the second.
Although objections have since resurfaced (e.g., Gaut, 2000)
to the view that it is these relations, in some form or the
other, in which the essence of art is located, present theories
of art proceed for the most part on this assumption. Disputes
in art theory center instead on the kinds of relation on which
art status depends: whether (a) historical, (b) institutional, or
(c) functional (for "functional" read "psychological," and for
"psychological" read "aesthetic"). Historical and institu-
tional views--which define art in terms of earlier artworks
and the institution of the artworld, respectively--are appar-
ently inadequate not only for standard reasons (circularity,
nominalism, etc.), but also because proponents of such views
(e.g., Davies, 1991; Stecker, 1997), to handle these objec-
tions, have had to effectively abandon necessary and suffi-
cient conditions for art by giving alternative, ad hoc accounts
in problematic cases (specifically the case of first art, which
lacks historical precedent and precedes the artworld itself).
As importantly, appealing to art's psychological/aesthetic
properties opens the door to explanations of how historical
precedence and artworld agency occur (see Iseminger, 2004).
The stakes, then, are far greater than what natural curiosity
there might be, and should be, in the "mere" neurological
profile of art. If psychological/aesthetic accounts are the
most promising among competing theories of art, then the
contribution of neuroaesthetics will be absolutely crucial in
discovering the underlying nature of aesthetic experience
and in finally uncovering the nature of art itself.
The next section will outline different sources of skepti-
cism about the potential role of neuroaesthetics in contribut-
ing significantly to the philosophy of art, showing how
scientists'ventures into art theory seem to confirm these sus-
picions, and how philosophers themselves likewise have
fallen short (shared narrowness of vision being to blame).
There will follow an account of how Ramachandran and
Hirstein's proposal, despite its apparent problems, dovetails
elegantly, and to mutual benefit, with a certain long-standing
tradition in philosophical aesthetics. It will also be argued
that this blend of neuroscience and traditional aesthetics has
the potential to defeat the skeptic on all three fronts (the rel-
evance of neuroscience to art theory, the existence of aes-
thetic experience as such, the central importance of aesthetic
experience to the philosophy of art), thus tackling the nature
of art from a wide interdisciplinary stance.
Narrow Vision?
Whether expressly so or merely by implication, many phi-
losophers are skeptical about whether neuroaesthetics has
anything significant to offer theories of art or aesthetic expe-
rience (such as Carroll, 2003; Currie, 2003; Davies, 1991;
Dickie, 2000; Seeley, 2006). There are three types of skepti-
cism about the role neuroaesthetics might play in contribut-
ing anything to the philosophy of art. This section will
distinguish these three forms of skepticism and show how
scientists' ventures into art theory, and philosophers' ven-
tures into science for art theory's sake, in some cases seem to
confirm such skepticism. It will also argue that this perspec-
tive is rather short-sighted.
The most obvious type of skepticism relevant here stems
from broad misgivings many philosophers have had about
whether empirical questions or findings can have any bear-
ing on philosophical theory: the view that philosophy is
strictly an armchair discipline. Although this "resistance to
facts" seems to have been overcome in the philosophy of the
natural and social sciences, traditional domains in the arts
and humanities--philosophy of art, saliently--have proved
more resistant, probably because--the "social" in "social
sciences" aside--of the suspicion that truly and distinctively
cultural phenomena lie beyond the long arm of scientific
reach, that scientific approaches are too low-level to reveal
what is desirable to know about art and aesthetic response
(Currie, 2003; Dickie, 2000; Mitter, 1999; Wallen, 1999).
This seems a mild version of the unfortunate trend now pop-
ular in the humanities to consider everything, and not just
everything social, "social." The trend is evident even when it
comes to pure descriptive questions such as "What is art?"
Holt 3
because such questions in particular often seem tightly if not
inextricably tied up with questions of value, not just psycho-
logical value but cultural meaning. Whether or not "art" has
a pure descriptive sense, the banishment of science from this
domain is held to be a principled one, Zeki's neologism
"neuroaesthetics" an affront, on this view, to good sense and
good taste.
A second type of skepticism derives, not from the belief
that science is ill-equipped or intrusive, but rather from anti-
realism about aesthetic experience. Perhaps science can
reveal a lot about art, perhaps not, but allowing that one
should quantify over experiences (after all, one might deny
that consciousness exists), aspersions have been cast on the
very term "aesthetic," because, it is argued, it fails to desig-
nate a legitimate experiential kind, as there seems to be noth-
ing common and peculiar to aesthetic experiences (Davies,
1991; Dickie, 1964). Often marshaled against the aesthetic
are various arguments to the effect that the notion of a disin-
terested aesthetic attitude, a peculiar aesthetic faculty, or a
distinctive aesthetic kind of perception, are at best irremedi-
ably vague, at middling susceptible to standard sorts of
argument-from-oddness objections, and at worst, most simply,
incoherent. The usual diagnosis (though note Shusterman's,
1997, cogent reply to such concerns) is that the very concept
of the aesthetic is the culprit, the prescription to eliminate it
from strict discourse about art, and the implication a fortiori
that neuroaesthetics on pain of recasting is a nonstarter.
A third type of skepticism might allow scientific input
into the realm of art theory, and might even include the aes-
thetic as a legitimate type of experience, but nonetheless
takes its cue from rival perspectives on art: historicism,
institutionalism, as well as antiessentialism (the view that
art cannot be defined). If any of these is correct, and the first
two can withstand the objections mentioned earlier, includ-
ing obviation of the "explanatory reduction" briefly
sketched, then neuroaesthetics will have little to say about
the nature of art. Note that it could still contribute much,
more narrowly, to theories of the aesthetic, in which case it
would still be a worthy, if more modest, endeavor. It would
be appropriate to note that historicist and institutional views
of art are often motivated by a rejection of the aesthetic as a
unifying, universal concept for art (see Davies, 1991, for the
general concern, Brown & Dissanayake, 2009, for the
neuroaesthetics-specific concern). Cases of the so-called
anti-art, or antiaesthetic art, the paradigm case of which is
Duchamp's Fountain (a urinal pseudonymously signed and
presented in an art gallery), which allegedly counts as art
and flouts the aesthetic, are usually adduced to show how art
and the aesthetic pull apart.
Such skepticism about the potential contribution of neu-
roaesthetics to the philosophy of art finds some support in
certain work by scientists treading in such unfamiliar terri-
tory. Take Zeki's (1999) Inner Vision, which was mentioned
at the outset and in which such claims are made (the first
figuratively apt, perhaps, but quite literally put) that artists
are neuroscientists (pp. 2, 10) and that all art aims at provid-
ing knowledge (pp. 9-10). Zeki also goes to great lengths in
establishing, for instance, that without the brain area respon-
sible for color vision (V4), one cannot appreciate the color of
a painting, that without the brain area responsible for per-
ceiving motion (MT or V5), one cannot fully appreciate
kinetic artworks like mobiles. To a philosopher of art, no
doubt, such elaborations come off as misguided in the first
case and rather trivial (not neuroscientifically trivial but,
given the neuroscience, aesthetically trivial) in the second.
As will be seen, similar concerns are raised likewise by some
of the assertions made by Ramachandran and Hirstein.
To forestall needless proliferation of instances, let these
suffice for now, save to observe that in most cases, and this
applies no less to philosophers who draw on, or simply give
lip service to, scientific research, here lies an unfortunate
narrowness of vision. Even where more interesting and use-
ful work is done (in linking visual ambiguity with interpre-
tive openness, for instance), not only is there an excess of
bottom-up material, it comes off as omitting the "up." Some
top-down work, or at least top-with-an-eye-to-down work,
seems necessary, as most interdisciplinary inquiry in this
area, whether by scientists or philosophers, concerns chiefly
visual art and the visual system, with scarcely a mention or
other (nonvisual) art forms, other sense modalities, or the
possibility of commonalities in aesthetic response across
various art forms. Of course, music will excite the auditory
cortex rather than the visual, but what might responses to
music and responses to painting have in common, perhaps in
different cortices, perhaps in common structures further
down the line? Whither breadth of vision?--or breadth
beyond vision? Perhaps surprisingly, in the answer to this
question one begins to glimpse the greatest contribution to
the philosophy of art that neuroaesthetics might make.
A Tradition's Cutting Edge
This section will directly engage Ramachandran and
Hirstein's (1999) "The Science of Art" as an illustrative case
to argue that, its apparent shortcomings aside, neuroaesthet-
ics meshes well at an abstract level with aesthetics of a more
traditional philosophical style, and so might just provide
insight into not only the underlying nature of aesthetic expe-
rience but also the ultimate nature of art itself. Discussion
will continue to be confined to chiefly philosophical
concerns.
On the surface, despite one of the authors being a philoso-
pher, "The Science of Art" reads like many other attempts by
scientists to engage in art theory. There are the expected prob-
lematic pronouncements, such as, without qualification, that
all art is beautiful (without disambiguating the beauty of the
depiction from the beauty of the thing depicted)--which is
suggested (Ramachandran & Hirstein, 1999) if not explicitly
made--and stranger, that all art is caricature, without address-
ing such obvious counterexamples as, say, photorealistic
4 SAGE Open
painting. The puzzling caricature principle derives from
emphasis placed throughout the article on what is called the
"peak shift" effect, a tendency to respond more intensely to
exaggerated versions of stimuli that humans are geared,
through habit or reward, to discriminate typically. If a person
is discriminating rectangles from squares, say, they will tend
to respond much more intensely to an elongated (thus exag-
gerated) rectangle. The fact that stimulus novelty generates
such response stresses the importance of the internal mecha-
nisms involved.
The peak shift effect is labeled one of the "laws of aes-
thetic experience," along with perceptual grouping and bind-
ing, attention allocation, contrast extraction, perceptual
problem-solving, the generic viewpoint principle, and--odd
as these may seem in rounding out the list--metaphor, and
symmetry (repetition/rhythm and balance are added to the
slightly altered list of Ramachandran, 2003). The diversity of
this list, the non-lawlike formulations of its "laws," and their
ambiguous scope, have been cause for concern, although
appreciated in some cases, among philosophers of a certain
mindset.
Although these more philosophical misgivings do not
scratch the surface of criticisms made from other disciplines
(as one may reasonably expect), the focus here will be on the
more philosophically central issues. Many of the claims
about which philosophers would rightly be prima facie skep-
tical can actually be given more deservedly defensible inter-
pretations. First, the claim that all art is beautiful will strike
many philosophers of art as absurd--when "beautiful" is
interpreted naturalistically--because where much art depicts
the beautiful, much of it also depicts the ugly, and so forth:
Botticelli's Venus is one thing, Goya's Saturn another. Add to
this that much postmodern art deliberately flouts any tradi-
tional notion of beauty (Western or Eastern), and it is clear
why many philosophers will too quickly dismiss the claim
that all art is beautiful. However, if art is deemed beautiful in
the sense that it provokes pleasurable aesthetic response,
then the claim seems much more plausible, and is not so easy
to dismiss. Still, Ramachandran and Hirstein seem to prefer
the more standard interpretation of "beautiful," which
remains open to this criticism except insofar as, despite their
claims to universality, their proposals are meant to apply
only to beautiful art in the narrower sense.
Second, the caricature principle (that all art is caricature)
could be given a similarly charitable reading. Abstract art is
a caricature insofar as, by definition, it is abstracted from,
hence serves in that sense as a caricature of, ordinary experi-
ence and representations of it. Not so with realistic represen-
tations, however, as a photorealistic painting is certainly no
caricature in the way that most political cartoons are. In fact,
Ramachandran (2003) is quite explicit about realistic repre-
sentation, in a snapshot, say, ruling the representation out of
the artwork class. The implications for a host of realistic
artworks--much artistic photography, photorealistic painting,
and so on--is distressing. It seems Ramachandran here sells
his theory short, in that realistic depictions can be interpreted,
and quite straightforwardly, as caricatures in some relevant
sense. Take photorealistic painting. Though not a typical cari-
cature, to be sure, a photorealistic painting is importantly dif-
ferent, "abstracted," from ordinary experience in one very
important way: by freezing time. In presenting a frozen
timeslice of a limited perspective, the visual display in a pho-
torealistic painting has, in a sense, made a caricature of the
depicted scene, which does not really stand still (and is not
really flat, either). Realism should apply as much in four
dimensions as in three.
Although such an interpretation is possible, it is perhaps
implausible to attribute it to the authors who, after all, sought
to provoke further discussion more than settle theoretical
matters outright. Even so, it is instructive to realize that "The
ScienceofArt"mighthavebettermileagethanRamachandran
and Hirstein had hoped. Clearly, some of its provocative
claims have yet to be fully appreciated (even by
Ramachandran himself) for their defensibility, as has been
shown, or their potential philosophical significance, as will
be shown.
Two important themes emerge from the provocative dis-
cussion in "The Science of Art." The first theme is well
expressed in the article's guiding question: "Might there be
some sort of universal rule or `deep structure' underlying all
[aesthetic] experience? . . . What is the brain circuitry
involved?" (p. 16). Not only does this question give the right
breadth of perspective so desperately lacking in much work
of this ilk, it indicates that certain crucial questions about the
aesthetic (whether there is such a thing, for one) might just
admit of answers that can be sought empirically, getting
beyond what often appears as intuition-haggling or question-
begging in the philosophy of art. (Ramachandran, 2003,
seems to think that philosophy is inherently this way, and so
cannot discover universal laws, much less testable ones--
otherwise philosophers would simply be scientists, as though
the philosophy of art were only good science or bad art
history.)
The second theme, an implicit one, is an apparent com-
monality lurking beneath the "8 laws" that begins, when
abstractly formulated, to resemble far more familiar aesthetic
theory than may at first appear: in aesthetic experience (as in
peak shift) there is a special, more intense response than in
ordinary experience, a relationship of special reinforcement
between distinct parts of the brain: the limbic system (spa-
tially lower, evolutionarily older, more emotional) and the
cortex (spatially higher, evolutionarily newer, more intellec-
tual: Holt, 1996, 2010). This perspective helps explain the
value of aesthetic experience, especially against a back-
ground commitment to the hypothesis that the explosive evo-
lution of the neocortex resulted in the human psyche being
typified by deep conflict between reason and emotion
(Koestler, 1967; Simeons, 1961).
Holt 5
The notion of aesthetic experience as consisting in a dis-
tinctive corticolimbic relation, though suggested in "The
Science of Art," is not given much notice there, even though
the idea suggests much greater universality--which the
authors prize above all--than the 8 (and later 10) principles
themselves. Nor is mention made that this unified view,
rather than competing, in fact complements more traditional
art theory, particularly a certain tradition in theorizing about
aesthetic experience, a tradition that can be seen in Beardsley
(1981, p. 552) acknowledging the debt of his account to that
of, among others, Richards, Ogden, and Wood (1925, pp.
75-77), where aesthetic experience is viewed as a harmoni-
ous "synaesthesis" between the intellect and the emotions.
These 20th-century analytic philosophers' views find prece-
dence in 19th-century Continental philosophy: Schiller's
(2004) notion of aesthetic experience as "equipoise" between
rational and natural impulses (pp. 74-75, 90), and even
Nietzsche's (1967) idea of the "fraternal union" of Apollo
and Dionysus (p. 132) can be seen as a similar view in more
symbolic garb. The corticolimbic relationship suggested by
"The Science of Art," then, appears to account, even if not
intended to, for how aesthetic experience, as given by such
philosophical descriptions, is implemented in the brain--
again, a complementary, not a competing, approach.
This complementarity with philosophy is encouraging,
revealing neuroaesthetics to be far broader, and far more
powerful, than it often appears and its critics suppose. Not
only is there the potential for a unified theory of aesthetic
experience across sense modalities here, the hypothesis of
aesthetic experience having a corticolimbic signature implies
the possibility of testing for such experience, even in the case
of so-called anti-art, which might be found to elicit such a
response despite the artist's intentions. The corticolimbic
signature of aesthetic experience might turn out to be some
unique kind of self-reinforcing thalamocortical feedback
loop. Although at this point the discussion is admittedly
speculative, it should be noted that this is where new neuro-
aesthetic lab work should take up the slack. It should also be
noted, however, that this proposal already has some intuitive
plausibility, coheres with an established philosophical tradi-
tion in aesthetics, gives a direction for further empirical
research (including suggestive hypotheses), and helps arm
the philosopher and neuroaesthetician alike against the
skeptic.
Consider how this perspective on complementarity sug-
gests replies to the various forms of skepticism outlined ear-
lier. To the resistance to scientific intrusion in this domain, it
might be observed that the scientific branch of neuroaesthet-
ics represents, not a threat to aesthetics, but a potentially
fruitful and, in a certain sense, badly needed partnership. The
low-level neuroscience will provide the means to flesh out,
refine, challenge, and vindicate certain accounts of aesthetic
experience, introspectively plausible and art-theoretically
sensitive. Without neuroaesthetics, the philosophy of art is
fleshless; without philosophy, the science of art is blind.
Skepticism about aesthetic experience as such, which is
usually grounded in the intuition that responses to art vary
far too widely for there to be anything distinctively "aes-
thetic" about them, can be parried by noting three things:
first, that the postulated "deep structure" of aesthetic experi-
ence would, if vindicated, unify aesthetic experience without
need of surface transparency; second, that the relational/mul-
tiple faculties model already allows for intellectual and emo-
tional content in aesthetic experience to vary as widely as
possible without sacrificing a commitment to unity in the
relation between the faculties; and third, that from the per-
spective of neuroaesthetics the existence of aesthetic experi-
ence as such is potentially up for grabs: but instead of just
"having a look," one goes into the lab and tests; the right sort
of brain imaging (such as functional magnetic resonance
imaging [fMRI]) of subjects enjoying different varieties of
art should help determine whether the requisite commonali-
ties obtain. Beyond the depth (i.e., the unavailability to con-
sciousness) of many aspects of ordinary mental life
(unconscious aspects of cognition, repressed desires, etc.),
the idea is that even a lack of phenomenological similarity
across different aesthetic experiences would not by itself
imply a lack of subliminal commonality: the hypothesized
corticolimbic signature.
Skepticism about the aesthetic approach to the philosophy
of art can be handled similarly. Grant that anti-aesthetic art
like Duchamp's Fountain counts as art, but does not appear
to satisfy aesthetic interest or reward aesthetic attention.
Still, some people like Fountain, and perhaps the deep struc-
ture of their appreciation, in concert with a phenomenologi-
cal sense of similarity (in some cases, though dissimilarity in
others) is the same as that of enjoying more standard works.
(Such works may unintentionally produce aesthetic experi-
ence and thus count as aesthetic despite an artist's possibly
anti-aesthetic intentions.) The suggestion is that once again
the hypothesis could be tested to find out whether Fountain
really is anti-aesthetic as Duchamp seems to have intended
(though this is itself disputable), bearing in mind that first-
person reports are not to be accepted unquestioned or ignored
outright, but rather incorporated into a complete picture of
the aesthetic situation. If Fountain were discovered not to
produce aesthetic experience, even in people who do appre-
ciate the work and as they do so, that would imply that the
appreciation is not of an aesthetic kind, that perhaps
Beardsley (1983) was right after all to argue that such works
should be seen as curiosities rather than true art objects.
Note, though, that Fountain might be discovered to produce
aesthetic experience in certain people under the right condi-
tions, even perhaps some who firmly believe it could never
so move them.
Conclusion
Although the descriptive aspects of art, as described, extend
from the armchair all the way to the lab, there is also,
6 SAGE Open
undiscussed as yet, some purchase on the value of aesthetic
experience, and this will help counter, albeit programmati-
cally here, another objection to the neuroaesthetic approach.
An opponent of neuroaesthetics might object that it is a
purely descriptive research program that, as such, fails to
account for the value, if not the character, of aesthetic experi-
ence: the failure of a naturalistic perspective to cross the
divide between the agreeable, for which evolutionary expla-
nations are tailor-made, and the truly beautiful, or better, the
aesthetically piquant, on which such explanations seemingly
must remain silent (Dutton, 2003, p. 703). Such an objection
is misguided, and suggests a one-dimensional view of evolu-
tion, as if the evolved cortex could not help but find the
agreeable (and whatever resembles it) agreeable, the dis-
agreeable (and whatever resembles it) disagreeable, as if it
were only things external that matter, ignoring the plausibil-
ity that, for all its advantages, cortical evolution is the very
cause of many of precisely those psychological conflicts
(sometimes about the agreeable) for which enjoying art,
however transiently, is an effective, and perhaps the preemi-
nent, means of resolution.
