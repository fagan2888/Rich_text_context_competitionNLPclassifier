Introduction
The insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP, EC
3.4.11.3) is a membrane-bound zinc-dependent amin-
opeptidase found in diverse tissues, including heart, brain
and fat.1 IRAP has also been described in various immune
cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), mast cells, B cells
and T cells.2,3 However, to the best of our knowledge
there is little information either on its presence in mac-
rophages or on its regulation in leukocytes. Macrophages
are tissue-resident white blood cells that regulate and
actively participate in inflammation.4 These cells typi-
cally express high levels of proteases and peptidases,5,6 in
line with their function in phagocytosis and extracellular
matrix degradation.7 One example is aminopeptidase-N
(AP-N, CD13, EC 3.4.11.2), which participates in multi-
ple functions in macrophages including antigen trim-
ming, phagocytosis, cell adhesion and signal
transduction.8,9 IRAP and AP-N are structurally closely
related and share to some extent common substrate speci-
ficity.10,11 IRAP has a broad pH and substrate range, with
a preference for (but not limited to) Cys-rich peptides
such as vasopressin, oxytocin and somatostatin.12 It also
helps in the generation of antigenic peptides from exog-
enous antigens for cross-presentation on major histocom-
patibility complex (MHC) class I in DCs.3 But what sets
IRAP apart from the other members of the M1 amin-
opeptidase family, is its extended cytoplasmic domain

Abstract
Introduction: The insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is expressed in several cell types, where it is mainly located
in specialized secretory endosomes that are quickly recruited to the cell surface upon cell type-specific activation. Here
we describe for the first time the expression and subcellular distribution of IRAP in macrophages.
Methods: IRAP mRNA expression, protein expression and presence at the cell surface was investigated by real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot and [³H]IVDE77 binding, respectively.
Results: IRAP mRNA expression was increased by interferon- (IFN-) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not by anti-
inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, transforming growth factor  (TGF-)). IFN- increased [³H]IVDE77
binding steadily over time, while LPS quickly and transiently recruited IRAP to the cell surface. Combined stimulations
with IFN- and LPS showed the same pattern as LPS alone. Latex particles also induced a transient recruitment of IRAP
to the cell surface, but no difference was observed in phagocytic uptake between wild-type and IRAP­/­ macrophages,
suggesting that the enzymatic activity of IRAP is not required for the ingestion of particles.
Conclusion: IRAP is more highly expressed in pro-inflammatory M1-activated macrophages and its presence at the cell
surface is modulated upon exposure to IFN-, LPS or exogenous particles.

(109 aa).13 This N-terminal domain contains two di-
leucine trafficking motifs (preceded by acidic residues),
which are responsible for the correct localization of IRAP
and its complex intracellular trafficking.14,15 In this
respect, IRAP is mainly located perinuclearly in special-
ized secretory endosomes under basal conditions.2,16,17
These endosomes can be quickly recruited to the cell sur-
face by activating cell type-specific receptors, such as the
FcR activation in mast cells,2 the oxytocin receptors in
vascular endothelial cells18 or insulin receptors in adipo-
cytes.19,20 At present, no receptor is known to trigger
IRAP recruitment in macrophages.
The hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV) is a natural
inhibitor of IRAP.21,22 Ang IV is extensively studied for its
memory-facilitating properties in mice and rats, however
its mechanism of action remains unresolved.23 Ang IV is
also reported to protect against ischemic stroke,24,25 hyper-
glycemia26 and atherosclerosis.27,28 Several research
groups, including ours, therefore continue to develop syn-
thetic Ang IV-analogues with enhanced stability and affin-
ity for IRAP.17,29 Of particular interest, Ang IV binding to
IRAP is described to activate the nuclear factor B pathway
(NF-B) in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. This in
turn results in an increased production of pro-inflammatory
factors such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor
 (TNF).30,31
In the present study we investigated the occurrence and
subcellular distribution of IRAP in mouse macrophages, as
well as the regulation of its expression by pro-inflammatory
mediators. We explored the function of IRAP in glucose
uptake and phagocytosis, and because of the central role of
the NF-B pathway in the induction of inflammation in
macrophages,32 we investigated the activity of Ang IV and
Ang IV-analogues on the expression of NF-B regulated
genes in macrophages.
Methods
Materials
Ang IV (Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) was obtained from
PolyPeptide Group (Strasbourg, France). AL-11 (2hVal-
Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-3hPhe) and IVDE77 (2hVal-Tyr-Ile-Aia-
Nva-Phe) were prepared as described before.33,34 Ang IV,
AL-11 and IVDE77 were used at a concentration of 1 µM,
unless specified otherwise. The specific activity of tritiated
[3H]IVDE77 amounted 0.90 TBq/mmol (24.4 Ci/mmol).
Recombinant mouse interferon- (IFN-) (BD Biosciences,
Erembodegem, Belgium) was used at 100 U/ml.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was obtained from Sigma
(Bornem, Belgium) and used at 1 ng/ml. IL-4 (100 U/ml),
IL-10 (100 U/ml) and transforming growth factor  (TGF-
) (5 ng/ml) were obtained from Peprotech (London, UK).
All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially
available.
Mice
IRAPwild-type (wt) and knock-out (IRAP­/­) C57BL/6 mice
that were generated by Ozgene (Ozgene Ptd Ltd, Australia)
as described before were bred at the animal house of the
Vrije Universiteit Brussel.35 Macrophage mannose receptor
deficient (MMR­/­) mice were provided by Etienne Pays
(Université Libre de Bruxelles). Signal transducers and acti-
vators of transcription deficient (STAT1­/­) mice were pro-
vided by Chantal Mathieu (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,
Belgium). Interferon regulatory factor deficient (IRF1­/­)
mice were a gift of Peter Brouckaert (Universiteit Gent,
Belgium). All experiments were approved by the Ethics
Committee at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium,
and met the standards required by the Belgian Council for
Laboratory Animal Science (BCLAS) guidelines.
Preparation and in vitro stimulation of
macrophage populations
Murine naïve peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) or thioglycol-
late-elicited (BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) peritoneal
macrophages (thioPEMs) were obtained by rinsing the peri-
toneum of naïve or thioglycollate-inoculated (four days prior
to cell collection) mice with PBS/10% sucrose.After 3 h cul-
ture in ME-medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 10% heat-inacti-
vated Foetal Calf Serum (FCS), 0.03% L-glutamine, 100
mg/ml streptomycin, 100 mg/ml penicillin, 1 mM nonessen-
tial amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.02 mM
2-mercaptoethanol) in 24-well plates, non-adherent cells
were washed away and the adherent peritoneal macrophages
were used for analysis. To generate bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs), bone marrow cells were cultured
for 10 days in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 20% FCS and 30% L929 conditioned
medium as a source of Macrophage-Colony Stimulating
Factor (M-CSF). These macrophage types were seeded at 106
cells/ml in ME-medium and subjected to stimulation by pro-
inflammatory M1-inducing mediators (IFN-, LPS), anti-
inflammatory M2-inducing cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-),
IRAP-ligands (Ang IV, AL-11, IVDE77), or combinations
thereof during 24 h unless stated otherwise.
Western blot
Total protein cell extracts were prepared as described ear-
lier.36 A quantity of 25 µg protein was separated on a 3­8%
NuPAGE® Novex Tris-Acetate Gel (Life Technologies,
Merelbeke, Belgium) and transferred onto a Hybond-C Extra
nitrocellulosemembrane(GEHealthcare,Diegem,Belgium).
After 1 h blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk, membranes
were incubated overnight at 4°C with IRAP (D7C5) XP®
rabbit monoclonal antibodies (Bioké, Leiden, The
Netherlands) or with mouse monoclonal to -actin (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK).After washing, membranes were incubated
468 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)
for 1 h with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody.
Expression was measured by electrochemiluminescence
(ECL) in a ChemidocTM XRS+ system (Bio-Rad, California,
USA) and the signal was quantified using Image Lab 3.0.
Radioligand binding
General principles were described before.37 Briefly, experi-
ments were carried out with [3H]IVDE77 at a final concen-
tration ranging between 1­20 nM for saturation binding
and 10 nM for all other experiments. Non-specific binding
was determined in the presence of 10 µM of unlabelled
AL-11. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD
) and
maximal number of binding sites (Bmax
) were calculated by
nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software).
The distribution of intracellular versus cell surface IRAP
in macrophages was investigated by the acid wash method
as described earlier.38 In brief, after 40 min incubation of
thioPEMs with 10 nM [3H]IVDE77, which is not cell-
permeable and hence only binds to IRAP at the cell surface,
the unbound ligand was washed away. The cells were then
treated with glycine buffer (pH 3.0) to disrupt and collect
the cell surface bound [3H]IVDE77, corresponding to the
fraction of IRAP at the cell surface. The remaining acid
resistant binding thus represents the internalized [3H]
IVDE77/IRAP complexes.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time
(RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis
Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative RT
PCR were performed as reported earlier.40 Primer sequences
are listed in Table 1. Gene expression was always normal-
ized using ribosomal protein S12 as housekeeping gene.
Phagocytosis assay
IRAP­/­ and wt thioPEMs were seeded in a 96-well plate
and stimulated with IFN- (100 U/ml) and LPS (100 ng/ml).
Yellow-green fluorescent latex microspheres (Polysciences,
Eppelheim, Germany) were then added (diluted 1:5000) and
incubated for 2 h, 24 h or 48 h at 37°C. Cells were washed
three times with PBS before fluorescence of the phagocy-
tosed particles was measured at an excitation wavelength of
440 nm and an emission of 486 nm in a TECAN® M200
spectrophotometer (Tecan Group Ltd., Mechelen, Belgium).
Flow cytometry
ThioPEMs from wt, IRAP­/­ and MMR­/­ mice were cul-
tured for 24 h either with or without IL-4 (100 U/ml). Cells
were then incubated for 20 min at 4°C, scraped and brought
to concentration (106 cells/ml) in Hank's Balanced Salt
Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum
and 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Anti-
FcR antibody (2.4G2, BD Biosciences) was added to the
cells for 20 min at 4°C, followed by staining (1 µg/106
cells) with anti-CD11b/PE-Cy7 (M1/70, BD Biosciences),
anti-F4/80/FITC (CI: A3-1, Serotec) and anti-CD206/PE
(MR5D3, Serotec) or the corresponding PE-conjugated iso-
type control (R35-95, BD Pharmingen). Dead cells were
excluded via 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) (BD
Biosciences). Data were acquired on a FACS Canto II (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed by FlowJo (Tree Star).
DQ-ovalbumin (DQ-OVA, Molecular Probes) process-
ing was performed as described before.41 Briefly, IRAP­/­
and wt thioPEMs were allowed to internalize and process
DQ-OVA for 15 min at 4°C (control) or at 37°C. Free
DQ-OVA was subsequently washed away and thioPEMs
were allowed to process internalized DQ-OVA further for
15, 30 or 60 min. Following each time interval, cells were
chilled, blocked with anti-FcR antibody and stained with
anti-CD11b/PE-Cy7 and anti-F4/80/PE. DQ-OVA fluores-
cence was measured via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter
(FACS).
Cytokine quantification
Secreted TNF levels from IRAP­/­ and wt thioPEMs cul-
tures were quantified using sandwich ELISA following
manufacturer's instructions (DY410, R&D Systems).
Glucose uptake assay
IRAP­/­ and wt thioPEMs were seeded in 24-well plates
and used either unstimulated or stimulated for 24 h with

IFN- or LPS (100 ng/ml). Cells were washed three
times with PBS and incubated for 20 min at 37°C in
buffer alone or with 20 µM cytochalasin B (Sigma,
Bornem, Belgium) to block glucose transport39. 2-deoxy-
D-[3H]glucose (Perkin Elmer, Zaventem, Belgium) was
then added at a final concentration of 1 mM (correspond-
ing to 1 µCi/ml) and incubated for 10 min at 37°C.
Uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose was stopped by wash-
ing the cells three times with PBS on ice. Cells were then
lysed with 1 M NaOH and the accumulated 2-deoxy-D-
[3H]glucose was measured after adding 3 ml of scintilla-
tion liquid (Optiphase Hisafe) using a -counter
(Perkin-Elmer, Zaventem, Belgium). Data refer to spe-
cific 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose uptake, calculated by sub-
tracting non-specific uptake in the presence of 20 M
cytochalasin B.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed at least three times with
triplicate determinations each, unless stated otherwise.
Radioligand saturation curves were obtained by analyzing
the data according to a one-site model using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software). Statistics were

Results
Different mouse macrophage types express
similar IRAP protein levels
The IRAP protein levels in different mouse macrophage
types (naïve PEMs, thioPEMs and BMDMs) were investi-
gated by Western blotting. IRAP protein expression was
comparable among all the macrophages tested and was
absent in IRAP­/­ macrophages, validating the IRAP-
specificity of the tested antibody (Figure 1). Notably, IRAP
protein levels in macrophages were twofold lower than
those in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which are known
as typical IRAP-expressing cells.16,42,43
IRAP is mainly located intracellularly in
resting macrophages
To investigate the presence of IRAP at the cell surface of
live macrophages, saturation binding experiments were
performed in vitro with theAng IV-analogue [3H]IVDE77.17
Specific binding of [3H]IVDE77 to wt thioPEMs was
clearly detectable, and the binding parameters were deter-
mined by non-linear regression (KD
6.71 nM±0.64 nM;
Bmax
0.27 pmol/106 cells±0.01 pmol/106 cells) (Figure
2(a)). ThioPEMs derived from IRAP­/­ mice showed no
specific binding, confirming that the measured radioactiv-
ity solely resulted from [3H]IVDE77 binding to IRAP.
Next we investigated the distribution of intracellular
versus cell surface IRAP in wt macrophages by the acid
wash method.38 Under basal conditions, only 15% of [3H]
IVDE77/IRAP complexes were located at the cell surface
of thioPEMs, while the remaining bound [3H]IVDE77 was
detected intracellularly (Figure 2(b)). These results indicate
that the translocation of IRAP in macrophages is a dynamic
process, in accordance with earlier observations in Chinese
hamster ovary cells.37
IRAP is higher expressed in M1-activated
macrophages
Macrophages are very modular cells that are especially
responsive to their environment.32,45,46 We therefore charac-
terized the expression and regulation of IRAP in mac-
rophages, to determine in which macrophage activation
state (pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2)
IRAP may be more prominent.
Compared to the control condition, expression of IRAP
mRNA rose almost threefold after 24 h stimulation with
Figure 1. Different mouse macrophage types express
similar insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) protein levels.
IRAP protein content was compared between mouse naïve
peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) (lane 1), thioglycollate-elicited
peritoneal macrophages (thioPEMs) (lane 2) and bone marrow-
derived macrophages (BMDMs) (lane 3). Differentiated 3T3-L1
adipocytes (3T3-L1), a typical IRAP-expressing cell line, served
as a positive control (lane 5).ThioPEMs from IRAP­/­ mice
served as a negative control (lane 4).A representative of two
experiments is shown here.

IFN- (2.68±0.62) (Figure 3). Using STAT1­/­ and IRF1­/­
macrophages, we demonstrated that the IFN--mediated
IRAP mRNA induction entirely depends on STAT1, but is
independent of IRF1, which is a STAT1-dependent tran-
scription factor responsible for the expression of `second
wave' genes (Figure 4). Besides IFN-, IRAP mRNA was
significantly induced by LPS (4.31±1.73). Combined stim-
ulations of thioPEMs with IFN- and LPS similarly
enhanced IRAP expression (3.72±1.70). On the other hand,
anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-) did not
significantly influence IRAP expression. These data indi-
cate that IRAPmRNAis more expressed by pro-inflammatory
M1-type macrophages.
Next, the modulation of IRAP protein expression was
investigated by Western blot. In line with the mRNA data,
IFN- and LPS significantly increased IRAP protein
expression compared to control samples (1.99±0.28 and
1.69±0.51, respectively) (Figure 5). The same expression
pattern was also observed after 48 h stimulation of thi-
oPEMs with IFN- or LPS (data not shown).
IFN- and LPS differentially modulate IRAP-
presence at the cell surface
Since we observed a significantly higher gene and protein
expression of IRAP after treatment with IFN- or LPS, we
assessed whether this upregulation translates into a higher
presence of IRAP at the cell surface of thioPEMs by [3H]
IVDE77 binding.
IFN- indeed increased [3H]IVDE77 binding, steadily
over time after 2 h (114%±3% of control), 24 h (171%±23%)
or 48 h (179%±23%) (Figure 6). Strikingly, a different pat-
tern was seen after LPS-treatment. Initially, LPS induced a
higher amount of IRAP at the cell surface after 2 h
(137%±19%), but then decreased [3H]IVDE77 binding to
control levels after 24 h (99%±19%) and even lower after
48 h (74%±4%). This decrease of [3H]IVDE77 binding
could not be explained by changes in cell viability as
checked by Trypan blue staining. Combined stimulations

Figure 2. Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is mainly located intracellularly in resting macrophages. (a) Saturation binding
to wild-type (wt) and IRAP­/­ thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (thioPEMs) was carried out with [3H]IVDE77 at a final
concentration ranging between 1­20 nM. Data refer to specific binding (expressed as pmol/106 cells), calculated by subtracting non-
specific binding in the presence of 10 M AL-11 from total binding.A representative of two independent experiments is illustrated.
(b) The distribution of intracellular versus cell surface IRAP was investigated by the acid wash method. Glycine buffer treatment (pH

with IFN- and LPS caused effects similar to LPS alone
(147%±14% after 2 h, 119%±12% after 24 h, 75%±6%
after 48 h).
IRAP is recruited to the cell surface during
phagocytosis
Recombinant soluble IRAP was reported to augment the
phagocytic uptake of latex beads by IFN-/LPS-stimulated
RAW264 macrophages.47 We therefore investigated
whether latex beads could recruit IRAP to the cell surface,
and whether IRAP-deficiency would decrease phagocyto-
sis in thioPEMs. Incubating wt thioPEMs for 2 h with latex
beads significantly increased subsequent [3H]IVDE77
binding (147%±17%) (Figure 7(a)). Remarkably, incubat-
ing the cells with latex beads for 24 h or 48 h did not show
increased IRAP surface expression, indicating that IRAP
recruitment to the cell surface was transient.
To assess the role of IRAP recruitment in phagocytosis,
the fluorescence of ingested latex beads was measured at
different time points in wt and IRAP­/­ thioPEMs. Basal
uptake increased gradually over time, in a similar fashion in
both wt and IRAP­/­ thioPEMs (Figure 7(b)). Phagocytic
uptake was more pronounced after treatment with IFN-/
LPS, but no significant difference between wt and IRAP­/­
thioPEMs was observed. Pre-treating wt thioPEMs for 1 h
with 1 µM IVDE77 to block the enzymatic activity for
IRAP also did not influence phagocytosis of latex beads
(Figure 7(c)).
IRAP-deficiency does not alter macrophage
mannose receptor (MMR)-mediated
endocytosis in macrophages
Besides phagocytosis of large particles, macrophages
also ingest molecules via receptor-mediated endocyto-
sis. In this context, MMR-mediated endocytosis is of
particular interest, since IRAP has been reported to co-
localize with MMR.3,48 Therefore, we first assessed
whether IRAP-deficiency could influence the distribu-
tion of MMR. No difference in MMR-positive cells was
observed by flow cytometry between IRAP­/­ and wt
thioPEMs (Figure 8(a)). IL-4 stimulation also increased
MMR expression similarly in both groups. Additionally,
we tested whether MMR-deficiency would alter the dis-
tribution of IRAP. No difference in [3H]IVDE77 bind-
ing to IRAP was observed between wt and
MMR­/­ thioPEMs (Bmax,wt
: 0.26 pmol/106 cells±0.01
pmol/106 cells; Bmax,MMR-KO
: 0.31 pmol/106 cells±0.10
pmol/106 cells) (Figure 8(b)). These data indicate that
although IRAP and MMR may co-localize, their distri-
bution is regulated independently of each other in
macrophages.
OVA uptake by macrophages is MMR-dependent.49
Hence, to test whether IRAP influences MMR functional-
ity, the kinetics of DQ-OVA uptake and degradation by wt
versus IRAP­/­ macrophages was assessed using flow
cytometry. However, no differences between both mac-
rophage types could be observed (Figure 9).
IRAP-deficiency does not influence glucose
uptake in macrophages
In fat and muscle cells, IRAP is co-localized with the glu-
cose transporter GLUT4 and is as such involved in insulin-
mediated glucose uptake.13,50 In addition, GLUT4 might
contribute to meeting the enhanced energy needs of acti-
vated monocytes.51
We therefore investigated whether IRAP plays a role in
the glucose uptake of macrophages. No difference was
observed in the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose between
wt and IRAP­/­ thioPEMs under basal conditions (Figure
10(a)). Glucose uptake strongly increased (approximately
50% higher compared to control) in both wt and IRAP­/­
thioPEMs after 24 h activation with IFN- or LPS (Figure
10(b)). These data indicate that IRAP may not be impli-
cated in glucose uptake by macrophages, both under basal
and inflammatory conditions.
Figure 4.Interferon- (IFN-)-mediated insulin-regulated
aminopeptidase (IRAP) mRNA expression is signal transducers
and activators of transcription (STAT1)-dependent, but
interferon regulatory factor ( IRF1)-independent. STAT1-
deficient (STAT1­/­) and IRF1-deficient (IRF1­/­) thioglycollate-
elicited peritoneal macrophages (thioPEMs) were treated with
IFN- for 24 h and IRAP mRNA expression was assessed via
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fold induction of
IRAP gene expression is plotted relative to the expression
level in the corresponding STAT1­/­ and IRF1­/­ untreated
macrophages (=1). Each · represents an independent cytokine
stimulation, followed by RNA-extraction and real-time PCR.

IRAP ligands do not modulate NF-B
regulated gene expression in macrophages
In view of the potential impact of IRAP binding on the
NF-B pathway,30,31 we investigated the modulatory activ-
ity of Ang IV and the stable Ang IV-analogue AL-1133 on
the expression of NF-B regulated genes (inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),
tumor-necrosis factor  (TNF), intercellular adhesion
molecule 1 (ICAM-1)) in macrophages by quantitative
real-time PCR (Table 1). None of these genes were induced
by Ang IV or AL-11, suggesting that IRAP binding does
not directly stimulate NF-B signaling in macrophages
(Figure 11).
Next, thioPEMs were subjected to LPS in combination
with Ang IV or AL-11 to analyze the potential modulating
effect ofAng IV/AL-11 in an inflammatory setting.52,53 Ang
IV did not significantly affect the LPS-induced expression
of NF-B regulated genes (iNOS, COX-2, TNF, ICAM-1)
(Figure 12(a)). In the case of treatment by AL-11, a reduc-
tion in the LPS-induced expression of iNOS and TNF,
only reaching significance in the case of TNF
(54.9%±26.7%), could be observed in macrophages (Figure
12(b)). However, AL-11 did not significantly influence the
secretion of TNF by LPS-stimulated macrophages, illus-
trating that IRAP binding does not have a major impact on
the inflammatory status of these cells (Figure 12(c)).
Discussion
For the first time, the presence and regulation of IRAP was
investigated in mouse macrophages. Total IRAP protein
expression was comparable between naïve PEMs, thi-
oPEMs and BMDMs (Figure 1). These data are in line with
the IRAP protein levels reported in dendritic cells, which
are similar between dendritic cell subtypes.3,54 The pres-
ence of IRAP at the cell surface of macrophages was shown
by specific binding of the Ang IV-analogue [3H]IVDE77.
No binding was observed in IRAP­/­ macrophages, indicat-
ing that no alternative binding sites nor specific uptake
mechanisms of [3H]IVDE77 take place. In all cell types
examined so far, IRAP localizes mainly in the perinuclear

region in specialized secretory vesicles.2,16,17 By use of the
acid wash method, we confirmed that only 15% of the total
IRAP pool was present at the cell surface of thioPEMs,
while the remaining [3H]IVDE77/IRAP complexes were
found intracellularly (Figure 2).
The transcriptional expression of IRAP was examined in
thioPEMs after 24 h treatment with pro-/anti-inflammatory
mediators. We observed that IFN- induced a threefold
upregulation of IRAP mRNA expression, which was
mediated by the transcription factor STAT1 but not by IRF1
(Figures 3 and 4). This translated into a corresponding
higher IRAP protein content and [3H]IVDE77 binding in
thioPEMs (Figures 5 and 6). These IFN- mediated effects
are very similar to the data of Gabrilovac and coworkers,8
which showed that IFN- induces a twofold increase in
AP-N mRNA and surface expression in the macrophage
cell line J774.
LPS-treatment also increased IRAP mRNA and protein
expression in thioPEMs. Minimally modified low-density
lipoprotein (mmLDL), which as LPS binds to Toll-like
receptor 4,55 was reported to increase IRAP-expression in
foam cells under high glucose and insulin conditions.56
Together with our observation that anti-inflammatory
cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-) did not induce IRAP-
expression, these data demonstrate that IRAP is more
expressed in pro-inflammatory M1-activated macrophages,
and suggest it may play a role in cytotoxic or inflammation-
associated functions.
A surprising pattern in [3H]IVDE77 binding was
observed in LPS-treated thioPEMs. While a relatively short
pre-incubation of 2 h with LPS augmented [3H]IVDE77
binding, it subsequently declined after longer time periods
(24 h and 48 h) (Figure 6). A possible explanation for the
rapid increase in [3H]IVDE77 binding is that LPS-treatment
might induce recruitment of IRAP-vesicles to the cell sur-
face of macrophages. Trafficking of IRAP-vesicles is
known to be triggered by different stimuli and is cell type-
dependent.3 For example, IRAP is quickly recruited to the
cell surface of mast cells upon FcR-activation with
opsonized antigen,2 or by oxytocin binding to its receptor in
human vascular endothelial cells.18 In this context, we also
observed a transient increase in [3H]IVDE77 binding to thi-
oPEMs after incubation with latex particles (Figure 7).
Further work is clearly required to identify the stimuli and
the involved signaling pathways responsible for IRAP-
trafficking in macrophages.
Increasing evidence points towards the importance of
IRAP in an immunological context. For instance, IRAP is
reported to be crucial for N-terminal trimming of exogenous
antigens that are directed for cross-presentation on MHC-I
in dendritic cells.48,54 Also, addition of recombinant IRAP in
the culture medium augments phagocytosis of latex beads in
IFN-/LPS stimulated RAW264-macrophages.47 While we
observed that fluorescent latex beads transiently recruited
IRAP to the cell surface, phagocytosis of these fluorescent
beads was however similar between wt and IRAP­/­ thi-
oPEMs, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of IRAP is
not required for the ingestion of particles. Given that the
N-terminal cytosolic tail of IRAP interacts with several pro-
teins implicated in protein sorting, vesicle formation and
cytoskeleton remodeling, we speculate that recruitment of
IRAP-containing vesicles may function as a shuttle, deliver-
ing important yet undefined proteins at the cell surface to
respond against LPS or exogenous particles.3,20,57­60

The C-type lectin receptor MMR is responsible for
receptor-mediated endocytosis of antigens containing high-
mannose structures (such as OVA).61 MMR has been shown
to be associated with AP-N in the macrophage cell line
J774,8 and in dendritic cells, MMR colocalizes up to 75%
with IRAP.48 In this context, our data indicate however that
no interdependency exists between the cell surface distribu-
tion of IRAP and MMR in macrophages (Figure 8). No dif-
ference was also observed in the MMR-mediated uptake
and processing of DQ-OVA between IRAP­/­ and wt thi-
oPEMs (Figure 9).
Macrophages involved in an immune response demon-
strate an increased glucose demand to meet the energy
needs for activation.62,63 In this context, uptake of glu-
cose represents the rate-limiting step.64,65 Hence, a rise in
translocation of glucose transporters (including GLUT4)
was reported in human monocytes after activation by
LPS.51 Since IRAP affects GLUT4-trafficking,57 we
investigated whether IRAP-deficiency would disturb glu-
cose uptake in macrophages. However, no difference in
glucose uptake was observed between wt and IRAP­/­ thi-
oPEMs, either under resting, IFN- or LPS-activated
conditions (Figure 10). IRAP may thus not be implicated
in glucose uptake, as supported by the observation that
glucose uptake increased by about 50% after 24 h LPS
treatment, while no increase in [3H]IVDE77 binding was
seen under the same conditions. These data do not exclude
the contribution of GLUT4 in glucose uptake during
inflammation, nor the existence of potential compensa-
tion mechanisms upregulating other glucose transporters
in IRAP­/­ thioPEMs.
A number of papers report activation of signaling path-
ways upon binding of Ang IV to IRAP, implying a recep-
tor function for IRAP.26,66­69 Of note, Ang IV activates the

inflammatory NF-B pathway in vascular smooth muscle
cells, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory
factors such as IL-6, TNF and ICAM-1.30 We therefore
investigated any potential modulatory effect of Ang IV
(and the Ang IV-analogue AL-11) on the NF-B pathway
in macrophages. Expression of the NF-B regulated genes
iNOS, COX-2, TNF or ICAM-1 was not induced by Ang
IV or AL-11 (Figure 11). On the other hand, an anti-
inflammatory trend could be observed, in particular the
LPS-induced expression of TNF was significantly
reduced in AL-11 treated macrophages. Secreted TNF
levels were however unaffected by Ang IV or AL-11. In
the current debate of IRAP functioning as a receptor,70
these data tend towards Ang IV as an anti-inflammatory
mediator.
Altogether, it is clear that IRAP plays different roles
depending on the cell type and extracellular environment.
In the case of macrophages, the role of (Ang IV binding
to) IRAP has just started to be unraveled. We showed
here that IRAP is higher expressed in pro-inflammatory
M1-activated macrophages, and that its presence at the
cell surface varies upon exposure to IFN-, LPS or exog-
enous particles. A further understanding of the regulation
and translocation of IRAP in macrophages by use of syn-
thetic Ang IV-analogues will contribute substantially to
elucidating the function(s) of IRAP in an immunological
context.
